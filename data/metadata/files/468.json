 "text": "MANON LESCAUT\n\nby\n\nAbbé Prévost\n\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\n  Why did he love her?  Curious fool, be still!\n  Is human love the fruit of human will?\n        BYRON.\n\n\nJust about six months before my departure for Spain, I first met the\nChevalier des Grieux.  Though I rarely quitted my retreat, still the\ninterest I felt in my child's welfare induced me occasionally to\nundertake short journeys, which, however, I took good care to abridge\nas much as possible.\n\nI was one day returning from Rouen, where I had been, at her request,\nto attend a cause then pending before the Parliament of Normandy,\nrespecting an inheritance to which I had claims derived from my\nmaternal grandfather.  Having taken the road by Evreux, where I slept\nthe first night, I on the following day, about dinner-time, reached\nPassy, a distance of five or six leagues.  I was amazed, on entering\nthis quiet town, to see all the inhabitants in commotion.  They were\npouring from their houses in crowds, towards the gate of a small inn,\nimmediately before which two covered vans were drawn up.  Their horses\nstill in harness, and reeking from fatigue and heat, showed that the\ncortege had only just arrived.  I stopped for a moment to learn the\ncause of the tumult, but could gain little information from the curious\nmob as they rushed by, heedless of my enquiries, and hastening\nimpatiently towards the inn in the utmost confusion.  At length an\narcher of the civic guard, wearing his bandolier, and carrying a\ncarbine on his shoulder, appeared at the gate; so, beckoning him\ntowards me, I begged to know the cause of the uproar. \"Nothing, sir,\"\nsaid he, \"but a dozen of the frail sisterhood, that I and my comrades\nare conducting to Havre-de-Grace, whence we are to ship them for\nAmerica.  There are one or two of them pretty enough; and it is that,\napparently, which attracts the curiosity of these good people.\"\n\nI should have passed on, satisfied with this explanation, if my\nattention had not been arrested by the cries of an old woman, who was\ncoming out of the inn with her hands clasped, and exclaiming:\n\n\"A downright barbarity!--A scene to excite horror and compassion!\"\n\"What may this mean?\" I enquired.  \"Oh! sir; go into the house\nyourself,\" said the woman, \"and see if it is not a sight to rend your\nheart!\"  Curiosity made me dismount; and leaving my horse to the care\nof the ostler, I made my way with some difficulty through the crowd,\nand did indeed behold a scene sufficiently touching.\n\nAmong the twelve girls, who were chained together by the waist in two\nrows, there was one, whose whole air and figure seemed so ill-suited to\nher present condition, that under other circumstances I should not have\nhesitated to pronounce her a person of high birth.  Her excessive\ngrief, and even the wretchedness of her attire, detracted so little\nfrom her surpassing beauty, that at first sight of her I was inspired\nwith a mingled feeling of respect and pity.\n\nShe tried, as well as the chain would permit her, to turn herself away,\nand hide her face from the rude gaze of the spectators. There was\nsomething so unaffected in the effort she made to escape observation,\nthat it could but have sprung from natural and innate modesty alone.\n\nAs the six men who escorted the unhappy train were together in the\nroom, I took the chief one aside and asked for information respecting\nthis beautiful girl.  All that he could supply was of the most vague\nkind.  \"We brought her,\" he said, \"from the Hospital, by order of the\nlieutenant-general of police.  There is no reason to suppose that she\nwas shut up there for good conduct.\n\n\"I have questioned her often upon the road; but she persists in\nrefusing even to answer me.  Yet, although I received no orders to make\nany distinction between her and the others, I cannot help treating her\ndifferently, for she seems to me somewhat superior to her companions.\nYonder is a young man,\" continued the archer, \"who can tell you, better\nthan I can, the cause of her misfortunes.  He has followed her from\nParis, and has scarcely dried his tears for a single moment.  He must\nbe either her brother or her lover.\"\n\nI turned towards the corner of the room, where this young man was\nseated.  He seemed buried in a profound reverie.  Never did I behold a\nmore affecting picture of grief.  He was plainly dressed; but one may\ndiscover at the first glance a man of birth and education.  As I\napproached him he rose, and there was so refined and noble an\nexpression in his eyes, in his whole countenance, in his every\nmovement, that I felt an involuntary impulse to render him any service\nin my power.  \"I am unwilling to intrude upon your sorrows,\" said I,\ntaking a seat beside him, \"but you will, perhaps, gratify the desire I\nfeel to learn something about that beautiful girl, who seems little\nformed by nature for the miserable condition in which she is placed.\"\n\nHe answered me candidly, that he could not communicate her history\nwithout making himself known, and that he had urgent reasons for\npreserving his own incognito.  \"I may, however, tell you this much, for\nit is no longer a secret to these wretches,\" he continued, pointing to\nthe guards,--\"that I adore her with a passion so ardent and absorbing\nas to render me the most unhappy of human beings.  I tried every means\nat Paris to effect her liberty.       Petitions, artifice, force--all\nfailed.  Go where she may, I have resolved to follow her--to the\nextremity of the world.  I shall embark with her and cross to America.\n\n\"But think of the brutal inhumanity of these cowardly ruffians,\" he\nadded, speaking of the guards; \"they will not allow me to approach her!\nI had planned an open attack upon them some leagues from Paris; having\nsecured, as I thought, the aid of four men, who for a considerable sum\nhired me their services.  The traitors, however, left me to execute my\nscheme single-handed, and decamped with my money.  The impossibility of\nsuccess made me of course abandon the attempt, I then implored of the\nguards permission to follow in their train, promising them a\nrecompense. The love of money procured their consent; but as they\nrequired payment every time I was allowed to speak to her, my purse was\nspeedily emptied; and now that I am utterly penniless, they are\nbarbarous enough to repulse me brutally, whenever I make the slightest\nattempt to approach her.  It is but a moment since, that venturing to\ndo so, in spite of their threats, one of the fellows raised the\nbutt-end of his musket.  I am now driven by their exactions to dispose\nof the miserable horse that has brought me hither, and am preparing to\ncontinue the journey on foot.\"\n\nAlthough he seemed to recite this story tranquilly enough, I observed\nthe tears start to his eyes as he concluded.  This adventure struck me\nas being not less singular than it was affecting.  \"I do not press\nyou,\" said I to him, \"to make me the confidant of your secrets; but if\nI can be of use to you in any way, I gladly tender you my services.\"\n\"Alas!\" replied he, \"I see not the slightest ray of hope.  I must\nreconcile myself to my destiny in all its rigour.  I shall go to\nAmerica: there, at least, I may be free to live with her I love.  I\nhave written to a friend, who will send me money to Havre-de-Grace.  My\nonly difficulty is to get so far, and to supply that poor creature,\"\nadded he, as he cast a look of sorrow at his mistress, \"with some few\ncomforts upon the way.\"  \"Well!\" said I to him, \"I shall relieve you\nfrom that difficulty.  Here is some money, of which I entreat your\nacceptance: I am only sorry that I can be of no greater service to you.\"\n\nI gave him four louis-d'ors without being perceived by the guards; for\nI thought that if they knew he had this money, they might have raised\nthe price of their concessions.  It occurred to me, even, to come to an\nunderstanding with them, in order to secure for the young man the\nprivilege of conversing with his mistress, during the rest of the\njourney to Havre, without hindrance.  I beckoned the chief to approach,\nand made the proposition to him.  It seemed to abash the ruffian, in\nspite of his habitual effrontery.  \"It is not, sir,\" said he, in an\nembarrassed tone, \"that we refuse to let him speak to the girl, but he\nwishes to be always near her, which puts us to inconvenience; and it is\njust that we should be paid for the trouble he occasions.\"  \"Let us\nsee!\" said I to him, \"what would suffice to prevent you from feeling\nthe inconvenience?\" He had the audacity to demand two louis.  I gave\nthem to him on the spot.  \"But have a care,\" said I to him, \"that we\nhave no foul play: for I shall give the young man my address, in order\nthat he may write to me on his arrival; and be assured that I am not\nwithout the power to punish you.\"  It cost me altogether six\nlouis-d'ors.\n\nThe graceful manner and heartfelt gratitude with which the young\nunknown thanked me, confirmed my notion that he was of good birth and\nmerited my kindness.  I addressed a few words to his mistress before I\nleft the room.  She replied to me with a modesty so gentle and so\ncharming that I could not help making, as I went out, a thousand\nreflections upon the incomprehensible character of women.\n\nReturned to my retreat, I remained in ignorance of the result of this\nadventure; and ere two years had passed, it was completely blotted from\nmy recollection, when chance brought me an opportunity of learning all\nthe circumstances from beginning to end.\n\nI arrived at Calais, from London, with my pupil, the Marquis of ----.\nWe lodged, if I remember rightly, at the \"Golden Lion,\" where, for some\nreason, we were obliged to spend the following day and night.  Walking\nalong the streets in the afternoon, I fancied I saw the same young man\nwhom I had formerly met at Passy.  He was miserably dressed, and much\npaler than when I first saw him.  He carried on his arm an old\nportmanteau, having only just arrived in the town.  However, there was\nan expression in his countenance too amiable not to be easily\nrecognised, and which immediately brought his features to my\nrecollection. \"Observe that young man,\" said I to the Marquis; \"we must\naccost him.\"\n\nHis joy was beyond expression when, in his turn, he recognised me.\n\n\"Ah, sir!\" he cried, kissing my hand, \"I have then once again an\nopportunity of testifying my eternal gratitude to you!\"  I enquired of\nhim whence he came.  He replied, that he had just arrived, by sea, from\nHavre, where he had lately landed from America.  \"You do not seem to be\ntoo well off for money,\" said I to him; \"go on to the 'Golden Lion,'\nwhere I am lodging; I will join you in a moment.\"\n\nI returned, in fact, full of impatience to learn the details of his\nmisfortunes, and the circumstances of his voyage to America. I gave him\na thousand welcomes, and ordered that they should supply him with\neverything he wanted.  He did not wait to be solicited for the history\nof his life.  \"Sir,\" said he to me, \"your conduct is so generous, that\nI should consider it base ingratitude to maintain any reserve towards\nyou.  You shall learn not only my misfortunes and sufferings, but my\nfaults and most culpable weaknesses.  I am sure that, even while you\nblame me, you will not refuse me your sympathy.\"\n\nI should here inform the reader that I wrote down the story almost\nimmediately after hearing it; and he may, therefore, be assured of the\ncorrectness and fidelity of the narrative.  I use the word fidelity\nwith reference to the substance of reflections and sentiments, which\nthe young man conveyed in the most graceful language.  Here, then, is\nhis story, which in its progress I shall not encumber with a single\nobservation that was not his own.\n\n\n\nII\n\n\n  I loved Ophelia! forty thousand brothers\n  Could not, with all their quantity of love,\n  Make up my sum.\n      SHAKESPEARE.\n\n\n\"I was seventeen years old, and was finishing my studies at Amiens,\nwhither my parents, who belonged to one of the first families in\nPicardy, had sent me.  I led a life so studious and well regulated,\nthat my masters pointed to me as a model of conduct for the other\nscholars.  Not that I made any extraordinary efforts to acquire this\nreputation, but my disposition was naturally tractable and tranquil; my\ninclinations led me to apply to study; and even the natural dislike I\nfelt for vice was placed to my credit as positive proof of virtue.  The\nsuccessful progress of my studies, my birth, and some external\nadvantages of person, made me a general favourite with the inhabitants\nof the town.\n\n\"I completed my public exercises with such general approbation, that\nthe bishop of the diocese, who was present, proposed to me to enter the\nchurch, where I could not fail, he said, to acquire more distinction\nthan in the Order of Malta, for which my parents had destined me. I was\nalready decorated with the Cross, and called the Chevalier des Grieux.\nThe vacation having arrived, I was preparing to return to my father,\nwho had promised to send me soon to the Academy.\n\n\"My only regret on quitting Amiens arose from parting with a friend,\nsome years older than myself, to whom I had always been tenderly\nattached.  We had been brought up together; but from the straitened\ncircumstances of his family, he was intended to take orders, and was to\nremain after me at Amiens to complete the requisite studies for his\nsacred calling.  He had a thousand good qualities.  You will recognise\nin him the very best during the course of my history, and above all, a\nzeal and fervour of friendship which surpass the most illustrious\nexamples of antiquity.  If I had at that time followed his advice, I\nshould have always continued a discreet and happy man.  If I had even\ntaken counsel from his reproaches, when on the brink of that gulf into\nwhich my passions afterwards plunged me, I should have been spared the\nmelancholy wreck of both fortune and reputation.  But he was doomed to\nsee his friendly admonitions disregarded; nay, even at times repaid by\ncontempt from an ungrateful wretch, who often dared to treat his\nfraternal conduct as offensive and officious.\n\n\"I had fixed the day for my departure from Amiens.  Alas! that I had\nnot fixed it one day sooner!  I should then have carried to my father's\nhouse my innocence untarnished.\n\n\"The very evening before my expected departure, as I was walking with\nmy friend, whose name was Tiberge, we saw the Arras diligence arrive,\nand sauntered after it to the inn, at which these coaches stop.  We had\nno other motive than curiosity.  Some worn men alighted, and\nimmediately retired into the inn.  One remained behind: she was very\nyoung, and stood by herself in the court, while a man of advanced age,\nwho appeared to have charge of her, was busy in getting her luggage\nfrom the vehicle.  She struck me as being so extremely beautiful, that\nI, who had never before thought of the difference between the sexes, or\nlooked on woman with the slightest attention--I, whose conduct had been\nhitherto the theme of universal admiration, felt myself, on the\ninstant, deprived of my reason and self-control.  I had been always\nexcessively timid, and easily disconcerted; but now, instead of meeting\nwith any impediment from this weakness, I advanced without the\nslightest reserve towards her, who had thus become, in a moment, the\nmistress of my heart.\n\n\"Although younger than myself, she received my civilities without\nembarrassment.  I asked the cause of her journey to Amiens, and whether\nshe had any acquaintances in the town.  She ingenuously told me that\nshe had been sent there by her parents, to commence her novitiate for\ntaking the veil.  Love had so quickened my perception, even in the\nshort moment it had been enthroned, that I saw in this announcement a\ndeath-blow to my hopes.  I spoke to her in a way that made her at once\nunderstand what was passing in my mind; for she had more experience\nthan myself.  It was against her consent that she was consigned to a\nconvent, doubtless to repress that inclination for pleasure which had\nalready become too manifest, and which caused, in the sequel, all her\nmisfortunes and mine.  I combated the cruel intention of her parents\nwith all the arguments that my new-born passion and schoolboy eloquence\ncould suggest.  She affected neither austerity nor reserve.  She told\nme, after a moment's silence, that she foresaw too clearly, what her\nunhappy fate must be; but that it was, apparently, the will of Heaven,\nsince there were no means left her to avert it.  The sweetness of her\nlook, the air of sorrow with which she pronounced these words, or\nrather perhaps the controlling destiny which led me on to ruin, allowed\nme not an instant to weigh my answer.  I assured her that if she would\nplace reliance on my honour, and on the tender interest with which she\nhad already inspired me, I would sacrifice my life to deliver her from\nthe tyranny of her parents, and to render her happy.  I have since been\na thousand times astonished in reflecting upon it, to think how I could\nhave expressed myself with so much boldness and facility; but love\ncould never have become a divinity, if he had not often worked miracles.\n\n\"I made many other pressing and tender speeches; and my unknown fair\none was perfectly aware that mine was not the age for deceit.  She\nconfessed to me that if I could see but a reasonable hope of being able\nto effect her enfranchisement, she should deem herself indebted for my\nkindness in more than life itself could pay.  I repeated that I was\nready to attempt anything in her behalf; but, not having sufficient\nexperience at once to imagine any reasonable plan of serving her, I did\nnot go beyond this general assurance, from which indeed little good\ncould arise either to her or to myself.  Her old guardian having by\nthis time joined us, my hopes would have been blighted, but that she\nhad tact enough to make amends for my stupidity.  I was surprised, on\nhis approaching us, to hear her call me her cousin, and say, without\nbeing in the slightest degree disconcerted, that as she had been so\nfortunate as to fall in with me at Amiens, she would not go into the\nconvent until the next morning, in order to have the pleasure of\nmeeting me at supper.  Innocent as I was, I at once comprehended the\nmeaning of this ruse; and proposed that she should lodge for the night\nat the house of an innkeeper, who, after being many years my father's\ncoachman, had lately established himself at Amiens, and who was\nsincerely attached to me.\n\n\"I conducted her there myself, at which the old Argus appeared to\ngrumble a little; and my friend Tiberge, who was puzzled by the whole\nscene, followed, without uttering a word.  He had not heard our\nconversation, having walked up and down the court while I was talking\nof love to my angelic mistress.  As I had some doubts of his\ndiscretion, I got rid of him, by begging that he would execute a\ncommission for me.  I had thus the happiness, on arriving at the inn,\nof entertaining alone the sovereign of my heart.\n\n\"I soon learned that I was less a child than I had before imagined.  My\nheart expanded to a thousand sentiments of pleasure, of which I had not\nbefore the remotest idea.  A delicious consciousness of enjoyment\ndiffused itself through my whole mind and soul.  I sank into a kind of\necstasy, which deprived me for a time of the power of utterance, and\nwhich found vent only in a flood of tears.\n\n\"Manon Lescaut (this she told me was her name) seemed gratified by the\nvisible effect of her own charms.  She appeared to me not less excited\nthan myself.  She acknowledged that she was greatly pleased with me,\nand that she should be enchanted to owe to me her freedom and future\nhappiness.  She would insist on hearing who I was, and the knowledge\nonly augmented her affection; for, being herself of humble birth, she\nwas flattered by securing for her lover a man of family.\n\n\"After many reflections we could discover no other resource than in\nflight.  To effect this it would be requisite to cheat the vigilance of\nManon's guardian, who required management, although he was but a\nservant.  We determined, therefore, that, during the night, I should\nprocure a post-chaise, and return with it at break of day to the inn,\nbefore he was awake; that we should steal away quietly, and go straight\nto Paris, where we might be married on our arrival.  I had about fifty\ncrowns in my pocket, the fruit of my little savings at school; and she\nhad about twice as much.  We imagined, like inexperienced children,\nthat such a sum could never be exhausted, and we counted, with equal\nconfidence, upon the success of our other schemes.\n\n\"After having supped, with certainly more satisfaction than I had ever\nbefore experienced, I retired to prepare for our project.  All my\narrangements were the more easy, because, for the purpose of returning\non the morrow to my father's, my luggage had been already packed.  I\nhad, therefore, no difficulty in removing my trunk, and having a chaise\nprepared for five o'clock in the morning, at which hour the gates of\nthe town would be opened; but I encountered an obstacle which I was\nlittle prepared for, and which nearly upset all my plans.\n\n\"Tiberge, although only three years older than myself, was a youth of\nunusually strong mind, and of the best regulated conduct.  He loved me\nwith singular affection.  The sight of so lovely a girl as Manon, my\nill-disguised impatience to conduct her to the inn, and the anxiety I\nbetrayed to get rid of him, had excited in his mind some suspicions of\nmy passion.  He had not ventured to return to the inn where he had left\nme, for fear of my being annoyed at his doing so; but went to wait for\nme at my lodgings, where, although it was ten o'clock at night, I found\nhim on my arrival.  His presence annoyed me, and he soon perceived the\nrestraint which it imposed.  'I am certain,' he said to me, without any\ndisguise, 'that you have some plan in contemplation which you will not\nconfide to me; I see it by your manner.'  I answered him rather\nabruptly, that I was not bound to render him an account of all my\nmovements. 'Certainly not!' he replied; 'but you have always, hitherto,\ntreated me as a friend, and that appellation implies a certain degree\nof confidence and candour.'  He pressed me so much and so earnestly to\ndiscover my secret, that, having never up to that moment felt the\nslightest reserve towards him, I confided to him now the whole history\nof my passion.  He heard it with an appearance of disapprobation, which\nmade me tremble; and I immediately repented of my indiscretion, in\ntelling him of my intended elopement.  He told me he was too sincerely\nmy friend not to oppose every obstacle in his power to such a scheme;\nthat he would first try all other means of turning me from such a\npurpose, but that if I refused to renounce so fatal a resolution, he\nassuredly would inform some persons of my intention, who would be able\nto defeat it.  He held forth upon the subject for a full quarter of an\nhour, in the most serious tone, and ended by again threatening to\ninform against me, if I did not pledge him my word that I would return\nto the paths of discretion and reason.\n\n\"I was in despair at having so awkwardly betrayed myself. However, love\nhaving wonderfully sharpened my intellect during the last two or three\nhours, I recollected that I had not yet told him of its being my\nintention to execute my project on the following morning, and I at once\ndetermined to deceive him by a little equivocation.\n\n\"'Tiberge,' said I to him, 'up to the present moment I thought you were\nmy friend; and I wished to prove it by the test of confidence.  It is\ntrue, I am in love; I have not deceived you: but with regard to my\nflight, that is a project not to be undertaken without deliberation.\nCall for me tomorrow at nine o'clock: you shall see my mistress, if it\nbe possible, and then judge whether she is not worthy of any risk or\nsacrifice on my part.'  He left me, with a thousand protestations of\nfriendship.\n\n\"I employed the night in preparing for the journey, and on repairing to\nthe inn at early dawn, I found Manon waiting my arrival.  She was at\nher window, which looked upon the street, and perceiving my approach,\nshe came down and opened the door herself.  We took our departure\nsilently, and without creating the least alarm.  She merely brought\naway a small portion of her apparel, of which I took charge.  The\nchaise was in readiness, and we were soon at a distance from the town.\n\n\"You will learn in the sequel what was the conduct of Tiberge when he\ndiscovered that I had deceived him; that his zeal to serve me suffered\nno diminution; and you will observe to what lengths his devotion\ncarried him.  How ought I to grieve, when I reflect on the base\ningratitude with which his affection was always repaid!\n\n\"We made such speed on our journey that before night we reached St.\nDenis.  I rode alongside of the chaise, which gave us little\nopportunity for conversation, except while changing horses; but when we\nfound ourselves so near Paris, and out of the reach of danger, we\nallowed ourselves time for refreshment, not having tasted food since we\nquitted Amiens.  Passionately in love as I felt with Manon, she knew\nhow to convince me that she was equally so with me.  So little did we\nrestrain our fondness, that we had not even patience to reserve our\ncaresses till we were alone. The postilions and innkeepers stared at us\nwith wonder, and I remarked that they appeared surprised at such\nuncontrollable love in children of our age.\n\n\"Our project of marriage was forgotten at St. Denis; we defrauded the\nChurch of her rights; and found ourselves united as man and wife\nwithout reflecting on the consequences.  It is certain that with my\neasy and constant disposition, I should have been happy for my whole\nlife, if Manon had remained faithful to me.  The more I saw of her, the\nmore I discovered in her new perfections.  Her mind, her heart, her\ngentleness and beauty, formed a chain at once so binding and so\nagreeable, that I could have found perfect happiness in its enduring\ninfluence.  Terrible fatality, that which has been the source of my\ndespair, might, under a slight change of circumstances, have\nconstituted my happiness.  I find myself the most wretched of mankind,\nby the force of that very constancy from which I might have fairly\nexpected to derive the most serene of human blisses, and the most\nperfect recompense of love.\n\n\"We took a furnished apartment at Paris, in the Rue V----, and, as it\nafterwards turned out, to my sorrow, close to the house of M. de B----,\nthe famous Fermier-general.  Three weeks passed, during which I was so\nabsorbed in my passion, that I never gave a thought to my family, nor\ndreamed of the distress which my father probably felt at my absence.\nHowever, as there was yet nothing of profligacy about me, and as Manon\nconducted herself with the strictest propriety, the tranquil life we\nled served to restore me by degrees to a sense of duty.\n\n\"I resolved to effect, if possible, a reconciliation with my parent.\nMy mistress was to me so perfectly lovable, that I could not doubt\nher power of captivating my father, if I could only find the means of\nmaking him acquainted with her good conduct and merit.  In a word, I\nrelied on obtaining his consent to our marriage, having given up all\nidea of accomplishing it without his approval.  I mentioned the project\nto Manon, and explained to her that, besides every motive of filial\nlove and duty, the weightier one of necessity should also have some\ninfluence; for our finances were sadly reduced, and I began to see the\nfolly of thinking them, as I once did, inexhaustible.\n\n\"Manon received the proposition with considerable coldness. However,\nthe difficulties she made, being apparently the suggestions of\ntenderness alone, or as arising from the natural fear of losing me, if\nmy father, after learning our address, should refuse his assent to our\nunion, I had not the smallest suspicion of the cruel blow she was at\nthe very time preparing to inflict.  As to the argument of necessity,\nshe replied that we had still abundant means of living for some weeks\nlonger, and that she would then find a resource in the kindness of some\nrelations in the country, to whom she should write.  She tempered her\nopposition by caresses so tender and impassioned, that I, who lived\nonly for her, and who never had the slightest misgiving as to her love,\napplauded at once her arguments and her resolutions.\n\n\"To Manon I had committed the care of our finances, and the house-hold\narrangements.  In a short time, I observed that our style of living was\nimproved, and that she had treated herself to more expensive dresses.\nAs I calculated that we could hardly have at this period more than\nfifteen or twenty crowns remaining, I did not conceal my surprise at\nthis mysterious augmentation of our wealth.  She begged of me, with a\nsmile, to give myself no trouble on that head.  'Did I not promise\nyou,' said she, 'that I would find resources?'  I loved her too purely\nto experience the slightest suspicion.\n\n\"One day, having gone out in the afternoon, and told her that I should\nnot be at home so early as usual, I was astonished, on my return, at\nbeing detained several minutes at the door.  Our only servant was a\nyoung girl about our own age.  On her letting me in at last, I asked\nwhy she had detained me so long?  She replied in an embarrassed tone,\nthat she did not hear me knock.  'I only knocked once,' said I; 'so if\nyou did not hear me, why come to open the door at all?'  This query\ndisconcerted her so visibly, that losing her presence of mind, she\nbegan to cry, assuring me that it was not her fault; and that her\nmistress had desired her not to open the door until M. de B---- had had\ntime to go down by the back staircase.  I was so confounded by this\ninformation as to be utterly unable to proceed to our apartment; and\nwas obliged to leave the house, under the pretext of an appointment.  I\ndesired the girl, therefore, to let her mistress know that I should\nreturn in a few minutes, but on no account to say that she had spoken\nto me of M. de B----.\n\n\"My horror was so great, that I shed tears as I went along, hardly\nknowing from what feeling they flowed.  I entered a coffee-house close\nby, and placing myself at a table, I buried my face between my hands,\nas though I would turn my eyes inward to ascertain what was passing in\nmy heart.  Still, I dared not recall what I had heard the moment\nbefore.  I strove to look upon it as a dream; and was more than once on\nthe point of returning to my lodgings, determined to attach no\nimportance to what I had heard.\n\n\"It appeared to me so impossible that Manon could have been unfaithful,\nthat I feared even to wrong her by a suspicion.  I adored her--that was\ntoo certain; I had not on my part given her more proofs of my love than\nI had received of hers; why then should I charge her with being less\nsincere and constant than myself?  What reason could she have to\ndeceive me?  Not three hours before, she had lavished upon me the most\ntender caresses, and had received mine with transport: I knew her heart\nas thoroughly as my own.  'No, no!' I said, 'it is not possible that\nManon can have deceived me.  She well knows that I live but for her;\nthat I adore her: upon that point I can have no reason to be unhappy.'\n\n\"Notwithstanding these reflections, the visit of M. de B----, and his\nsecret departure, gave me some uneasiness.  I remembered, too, the\nlittle purchases she had lately made, which seemed beyond our present\nmeans.  This looked like the liberality of a new lover.  And the\nconfidence with which she had foretold resources which were to me\nunknown?  I had some difficulty in solving these mysteries in as\nfavourable a manner as my heart desired.\n\n\"On the other hand, she had been hardly out of my sight since we\nentered Paris.  However occupied, in our walks, in all our amusements,\nshe was ever at my side.  Heavens! even a momentary separation would\nhave been too painful.  I could not therefore imagine how Manon could,\nto any other person, have devoted a single instant.\n\n\"At last I thought I had discovered a clue to the mystery.  'M. de\nB----' said I to myself, 'is a man extensively engaged in commercial\naffairs; and Manon's relations have no doubt remitted her money through\nhis house.  She has probably already received some from him, and he is\ncome today to bring her more.  She wishes, perhaps, to derive amusement\nby and by, from an agreeable surprise, by keeping me at present in the\ndark.  She would doubtless have at once told me all, if I had gone in\nas usual, instead of coming here to distress myself: at all events, she\nwill not conceal it from me when I broach the subject myself.'\n\n\"I cherished this idea so willingly, that it considerably lightened my\ngrief.  I immediately returned to my lodgings, and embraced Manon as\ntenderly as ever.  She received me as usual. At first I was tempted to\nmention my conjectures, which I now, more than ever, looked upon as\ncertain; but I restrained myself in the hope that she might render it\nunnecessary by informing me of all that had passed.\n\n\"Supper was served.  Assuming an air of gaiety, I took my seat at\ntable; but by the light of the candles which were between us, I fancied\nI perceived an air of melancholy about the eyes and countenance of my\nbeloved mistress.  The very thought soon damped my gaiety.  I remarked\nthat her looks wore an unusual expression, and although nothing could\nbe more soft or languishing, I was at a loss to discover whether they\nconveyed more of love than of compassion.  I gazed at her with equal\nearnestness, and she perhaps had no less difficulty in comprehending\nfrom my countenance what was passing in my heart.  We neither spoke nor\nate.  At length I saw tears starting from her beauteous\neyes--perfidious tears!  'Oh heavens!' I cried, 'my dearest Manon, why\nallow your sorrows to afflict you to this degree without imparting\ntheir cause to me?'  She answered me only with sighs, which increased\nmy misery.  I arose trembling from my seat: I conjured her, with all\nthe urgent earnestness of love, to let me know the cause of her grief:\nI wept in endeavouring to soothe her sorrows: I was more dead than\nalive.  A barbarian would have pitied my sufferings as I stood\ntrembling with grief and apprehension.\n\n\"While my attention was thus confined to her, I heard people coming\nupstairs.  They tapped gently at the door.  Manon gave me a kiss, and\nescaping from my arms, quickly entered the boudoir, turning the key\nafter her.  I imagined that, not being dressed to receive strangers,\nshe was unwilling to meet the persons who had knocked; I went to let\nthem in.\n\n\"I had hardly opened the door, when I found myself seized by three men,\nwhom I recognised as my father's servants.  They offered not the least\nviolence, but two of them taking me by the arms, the third examined my\npockets, and took out a small knife, the only weapon I had about me.\nThey begged pardon for the necessity they were under of treating me\nwith apparent disrespect; telling me frankly that they were acting by\nthe orders of my father, and that my eldest brother was in a carriage\nbelow waiting to receive me.  My feelings were so overpowered, that I\nallowed myself to be led away without making either reply or\nresistance.  I found my brother waiting for me as they had stated.\nThey placed me by his side, and the coachman immediately drove, by his\norders, towards St. Denis.\n\n\"My brother embraced me most affectionately, but during our ride, he\nuttered not a word, so that, as I was not inclined for conversation, I\nhad as much leisure as I could desire to reflect upon my misfortunes.\"\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\n  That we can call these delicate creatures ours,\n  And not their appetites.\n        SHAKESPEARE.\n\n\n\"The whole affair was so involved in obscurity that I could not see my\nway even to a reasonable conjecture.  I was cruelly betrayed--that was\ncertain; but by whom?  Tiberge first occurred to me.  'Tiberge!' said\nI, 'it is as much as thy life is worth, if my suspicions turn out to be\nwell founded.'  However, I recollected that he could not by possibility\nknow my abode; and therefore, he could not have furnished the\ninformation.  To accuse Manon was more than my heart was capable of.\nThe unusual melancholy with which she had lately seemed weighed down,\nher tears, the tender kiss she gave me in parting, made it all as yet a\nmystery to me.  I could only look upon her recent melancholy as a\npresentiment of our common misfortune; and while I was deploring the\nevent which tore me from her, I was credulous enough to consider her\nfate as much deserving of pity as my own.\n\n\"The result of my reflections was, that I had been seen and followed in\nthe streets of Paris by some persons of my acquaintance, who had\nconveyed the information to my father. This idea comforted me.  I made\nup my mind to encounter some reproaches, or perhaps harsh treatment,\nfor having outraged the paternal authority.  I resolved, however, to\nsuffer with patience, and to promise all that might be required of me,\nin order to facilitate my speedy return to Paris, that I might restore\nlife and happiness to my dear Manon.\n\n\"We soon arrived at St. Denis.  My brother, surprised at my long\nsilence, thought it the effect of fear.  He assured me that I had\nnothing to apprehend from my father's severity, provided I showed a\ndisposition to return quietly to the path of duty, and prove myself\nworthy of his affection.  He made me pass the night at St. Denis,\nmerely taking the precaution of putting the three lackeys to sleep in\nmy room.  It cost me a pang to find myself in the same inn where I had\nstopped with Manon on our way from Amiens to Paris.  The innkeeper and\nhis servants recognised me, and guessed at once the truth of my\nhistory.  I overheard them say, 'Ah! that's the handsome young\ngentleman who travelled this road about a month ago, with the beautiful\ngirl he appeared so much in love with!  How pretty she was!  The poor\nyoung things, how they caressed each other!  Pity if they have been\nseparated!'  I pretended not to hear, and kept as much out of sight as\npossible.\n\n\"At St. Denis my brother had a chariot waiting for us, in which we\nstarted early the next morning, and arrived at home before night.\n\n\"He saw my father first, in order to make a favourable impression by\ntelling him how quietly I had allowed myself to be brought away, so\nthat his reception of me was less austere than I had expected.  He\nmerely rebuked me in general terms for the offence I had committed, by\nabsenting myself without his permission.  As for my mistress, he said I\nrichly deserved what had happened to me, for abandoning myself to a\nperson utterly unknown; that he had entertained a better opinion of my\ndiscretion; but that he hoped this little adventure would make me\nwiser.  I took the whole lecture only in the sense that accorded with\nmy own notions.  I thanked my father for his indulgence, and promised\nthat I would in future observe a better regulated and more obedient\ncourse of conduct.  I felt that I had secured a triumph; for, from the\npresent aspect of affairs, there was no doubt that I should be free to\neffect my escape from the house even before the night was over.\n\n\"We sat down to supper.  They rallied me about my Amiens conquest, and\nmy flight with that paragon of fidelity.  I took their jokes in good\npart, glad enough at being permitted to revolve in my mind the plans I\nhad meditated; but some words which fell from my father made me listen\nwith earnest attention. He spoke of perfidy, and the not disinterested\nkindness he had received at the hands of M. de B----.  I was almost\nparalysed on hearing the name, and begged of my father to explain\nhimself.  He turned to my brother, to ask if he had not told me the\nwhole story.  My brother answered, that I appeared to him so tranquil\nupon the road, that he did not suppose I required this remedy to cure\nme of my folly.  I remarked that my father was doubtful whether he\nshould give me the explanation or not.  I entreated him so earnestly\nthat he satisfied me, or I should rather say tortured me, with the\nfollowing most horrible narration.\n\n\"He began by asking me whether I was really simple enough to believe\nthat I had been really loved by the girl.  I told him confidently that\nI was perfectly sure of it, and that nothing could make me for a moment\ndoubt it. 'Ha, ha, ha!' said he, with a loud laugh; 'that is excellent!\nyou are a pretty dupe! Admirable idea!  'Twould be a thousand pities,\nmy poor chevalier, to make you a Knight of Malta, with all the\nrequisites you possess for a patient and accommodating husband.'  He\ncontinued in the same tone to ridicule what he was pleased to call my\ndullness and credulity.\n\n\"He concluded, while I maintained a profound silence, by saying that,\naccording to the nicest calculation he could make of the time since my\ndeparture from Amiens, Manon must have been in love with me about\ntwelve days; 'for,' said he, 'I know that you left Amiens on the 28th\nof last month; this is, the 29th of the present; it is eleven days\nsince M. de B---- wrote to me; I suppose he required eight days to\nestablish a perfect understanding with your mistress; so that, take\neight and eleven from thirty-one days, the time between the 28th of one\nmonth and the 29th of the next, there remains twelve, more or less!'\nThis joke was followed by shouts of laughter.\n\n\"I heard it all with a kind of sinking of the heart that I thought I\ncould not bear up against, until he finished.  'You must know then,'\ncontinued my father, 'since you appear as yet ignorant of it, that M.\nde B---- has won the affections of your idol; for he can't be serious\nin pretending that it is his disinterested regard for me that has\ninduced him to take her from you.  It would be absurd to expect such\nnoble sentiments from a man of his description, and one, besides, who\nis a perfect stranger to me.  He knew that you were my son, and in\norder to get rid of you, he wrote to inform me of your abode, and of\nthe life you led; saying, at the same time, that strong measures would\nbe necessary to secure you.\n\n\"He offered to procure me the means of laying hold of you; and it was\nby his direction, as well as that of your mistress herself, that your\nbrother hit upon the moment for catching you unawares. Now, you may\ncongratulate yourself upon the duration of your triumph.  You know how\nto conquer, rapid enough; but you have yet to learn how to secure your\nconquests.'\n\n\"I could no longer endure these remarks, every one of which struck a\ndagger to my heart.  I arose from the table, and had not advanced four\nsteps towards the door, when I fell upon the floor, perfectly\nsenseless.  By prompt applications they soon brought me to myself.  My\neyes opened only to shed a torrent of tears, and my lips to utter the\nmost sorrowful and heartrending complaints. My father, who always loved\nme most affectionately, tried every means to console me.  I listened to\nhim, but his words were without effect.  I threw myself at his feet, in\nthe attitude of prayer, conjuring him to let me return to Paris, and\ndestroy the monster B----.  'No!' cried I; 'he has not gained Manon's\nheart; he may have seduced her by charms, or by drugs; he may have even\nbrutally violated her.  Manon loves me.  Do I not know that well? He\nmust have terrified her with a poniard, to induce her to abandon me.'\nWhat must he not have done to have robbed me of my angelic mistress?\nOh Heaven!  Heaven! can it be possible that Manon deceived me, or that\nshe has ceased to love me!\n\n\"As I continued to rave about returning at once to Paris, and was\nperpetually starting up with that purpose, my father clearly saw that\nwhile the paroxysm lasted, no arguments could pacify me. He conducted\nme to one of the upper rooms, and left two servants to keep constant\nwatch over me.  I was completely bewildered.  I would have given a\nthousand lives to be but for one quarter of an hour in Paris.  I had\nsense enough, however, to know that having so openly declared my\nintention, they would not easily allow me to quit my chamber.  I looked\nat the height of the windows. Seeing no possibility of escaping that\nway, I addressed the servants in the most tranquil tone.  I promised,\nwith the most solemn vows, to make at some future day their fortunes,\nif they would but consent to my escape.  I entreated them; I tried\ncaresses, and lastly threats; but all were unavailing.  I gave myself\nup to despair.  I resolved to die; and threw myself upon the bed, with\na firm determination to quit it only with my life. In this situation I\npassed the night and the following day.  I refused the nourishment that\nwas brought to me next morning.\n\n\"My father came to see me in the afternoon.  He tried in the most\naffectionate manner, to soothe my grief.  He desired me so urgently to\ntake some refreshment, that, to gratify him, I obeyed his wishes.\nSeveral days passed, during which I took nothing but in his presence,\nand at his special request.  He continued to furnish new arguments to\nrestore me to my proper senses, and to inspire me with merited contempt\nfor the faithless Manon.  I certainly had lost all esteem for her: how\ncould I esteem the most fickle and perfidious of created beings!  But\nher image--those exquisite features, which were engraven on my heart's\ncore, were still uneffaced.  I understood my own feelings:  'I may\ndie,' said I, 'and I ought to die after so much shame and grief; but I\nmight suffer a thousand deaths without being able to forget the ingrate\nManon.'\n\n\"My father was surprised at my still continuing so powerfully affected.\nHe knew that I was imbued with the principles of honour; and not\ndoubting that her infidelity must make me despise her, fancied that my\nobstinacy proceeded less from this particular passion, than from a\ngeneral inclination towards the sex.  This idea so took possession of\nhis mind, that, prompted only by his affection for me, he came one day\nto reveal his thoughts.  'Chevalier,' said he to me, 'it has been\nhitherto my intention to make you bear the Cross of Malta: I now see\nthat your inclinations do not bend that way.  You are an admirer of\nbeauty.  I shall be able to find you a wife to your taste.  Let me\ncandidly know how you feel upon the subject.'\n\n\"I answered that I could never again see the slightest difference\namongst women, and that after the misfortune I had experienced, I\ndetested them all equally.  'I will find you one,' replied my father,\nsmiling, 'who shall resemble Manon in beauty, but who shall be more\nfaithful.'  'Ah! if you have any mercy,' said I, 'you will restore my\nManon to me.  Be assured, my dear father, that she has not betrayed me;\nshe is incapable of such base and cruel treachery.  It is the\nperfidious B---- who deceives both her and me.  If you could form an\nidea of her tenderness and her sincerity--if you only knew her, you\nyourself would love her!'  'You are absolutely a child,' replied my\nfather. 'How can you so delude yourself, after what I have told you\nabout her?  It was she who actually delivered you up to your brother.\nYou ought to obliterate even her name from your memory, and take\nadvantage, if you are wise, of the indulgence I am showing you.'\n\n\"I very clearly perceived that my father was right.  It was an\ninvoluntary emotion that made me thus take part with the traitor.\n'Alas!' replied I, after a moment's silence, 'it is but too true that I\nam the unhappy victim of the vilest perfidy.  Yes,' I continued, while\nshedding tears of anger, 'I too clearly perceive that I am indeed but a\nchild.  Credulity like mine was easily gulled; but I shall be at no\nloss to revenge myself.'  My father enquired of me my intentions:  'I\nwill go to Paris,' I said, 'set fire to B----'s house, and immolate him\nand the perfidious Manon together.'  This burst made my father laugh,\nand had only the effect of causing me to be more vigilantly watched in\nmy cell.\n\n\"I thus passed six long months; during the first of which my mind\nunderwent little change.  My feelings were in a state of perpetual\nalternation between hate and love; between hope and despair; according\nas, the tendency of each passing thought brought Manon back to my\nrecollection.  At one time, I could see in her the most delightful of\nwomen only, and sigh for the pleasure of beholding her once more; at\nanother, I felt she was the most unworthy and perfidious of mistresses,\nand I would on these occasions swear never again to seek her, but for\nthe purpose of revenge.\n\n\"I was supplied with books, which served to restore my peace of mind.\nI read once again all my favourite authors; and I became acquainted\nwith new ones.  All my former taste for study was revived.  You will\nsee of what use this was to me in the sequel. The light I had already\nderived from love, enabled me to comprehend many passages in Horace and\nVirgil which had before appeared obscure.  I wrote an amatory\ncommentary upon the fourth book of the AEneid.  I intend one day to\npublish it, and I flatter myself it will be popular.\n\n\"'Alas!' I used to exclaim, 'whilst employed on that work, it was for a\nheart like mine the faithful Dido sighed, and sighed in vain!'\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\n  Now, by the strange enchantment that surrounds thee,\n  There's nothing--nothing thou shalt ask in vain.\n        ESSEX.\n\n\n\"While in my confinement Tiberge came one day to see me.  I was\nsurprised at the affectionate joy with which he saluted me.  I had\nnever, hitherto, observed any peculiar warmth in his friendship that\ncould lead me to look upon it as anything more than the partiality\ncommon among boys of the same age.  He was so altered, and had grown so\nmanly during the five or six months since I had last seen him, that his\nexpressive features and his manner of addressing me inspired me with a\nfeeling of respect. He spoke more in the character of a mentor than a\nschoolfellow, lamented the delusion into which I had fallen,\ncongratulated me on my reformation, which he believed was now sincere,\nand ended by exhorting me to profit by my youthful error, and open my\neyes to the vanity of worldly pleasures.  I looked at him with some\nastonishment, which he at once perceived.\n\n\"'My dear chevalier,' said he to me, 'you shall hear nothing but the\nstrict truth, of which I have assured myself by the most serious\nexamination.  I had, perhaps, as strong an inclination for pleasure as\nyou, but Heaven had at the same time, in its mercy, blessed me with a\ntaste for virtue.  I exercised my reason in comparing the consequences\nof the one with those of the other, and the divine aid was graciously\nvouchsafed to my reflections. I conceived for the world a contempt\nwhich nothing can equal. Can you guess what it is retains me in it\nnow,' he added, 'and that prevents me from embracing a life of\nsolitude?  Simply the sincere friendship I bear towards you.  I know\nthe excellent qualities of both your heart and head.  There is no good\nof which you may not render yourself capable.  The blandishments of\npleasure have momentarily drawn you aside.  What detriment to the\nsacred cause of virtue!  Your flight from Amiens gave me such intense\nsorrow, that I have not since known a moment's happiness. You may judge\nof this by the steps it induced me to take.'  He then told me how,\nafter discovering that I had deceived him, and gone off with my\nmistress, he procured horses for the purpose of pursuing me, but having\nthe start of him by four or five hours, he found it impossible to\novertake me; that he arrived, however, at St. Denis half an hour after\nI had left it; that, being very sure that I must have stopped in Paris,\nhe spent six weeks there in a fruitless endeavour to discover\nme--visiting every place where he thought he should be likely to meet\nme, and that one evening he at length recognised my mistress at the\nplay, where she was so gorgeously dressed, that he of course set it\ndown to the account of some new lover; that he had followed her\nequipage to her house, and had there learned from a servant that she\nwas entertained in this style by M. de B----.  'I did not stop here,'\ncontinued he; 'I returned next day to the house, to learn from her own\nlips what had become of you.  She turned abruptly away when she heard\nthe mention of your name, and I was obliged to return into the country\nwithout further information.  I there learned the particulars of your\nadventure, and the extreme annoyance she had caused you; but I was\nunwilling to visit you until I could have assurance of your being in a\nmore tranquil state.'\n\n\"'You have seen Manon then!' cried I, sighing. 'Alas! you are happier\nthan I, who am doomed never again to behold her.'  He rebuked me for\nthis sigh, which still showed my weakness for the perfidious girl.  He\nflattered me so adroitly upon the goodness of my mind and disposition,\nthat he really inspired me, even on this first visit, with a strong\ninclination to renounce, as he had done, the pleasures of the world,\nand enter at once into holy orders.\n\n\"The idea was so suited to my present frame of mind, that when alone I\nthought of nothing else.  I remembered the words of the Bishop of\nAmiens, who had given me the same advice, and thought only of the\nhappiness which he predicted would result from my adoption of such a\ncourse.  Piety itself took part in these suggestions.  'I shall lead a\nholy and a Christian life,' said I; 'I shall divide my time between\nstudy and religion, which will allow me no leisure for the perilous\npleasures of love.  I shall despise that which men ordinarily admire;\nand as I am conscious that my heart will desire nothing but what it can\nesteem, my cares will not be greater or more numerous than my wants and\nwishes.'\n\n\"I thereupon pictured to myself in anticipation a course of life\npeaceful and retired.  I fancied a retreat embosomed in a wood, with a\nlimpid stream of running water bounding my garden; a library,\ncomprising the most select works; a limited circle of friends, virtuous\nand intellectual; a table neatly served, but frugal and temperate.  To\nall these agremens I added a literary correspondence with a friend\nwhose residence should be in Paris, who should give me occasional\ninformation upon public affairs, less for the gratification of my\ncuriosity, than to afford a kind of relaxation by hearing of and\nlamenting the busy follies of men.  'Shall not I be happy?' added I;\n'will not my utmost wishes be thus gratified?'  This project flattered\nmy inclinations extremely.  But after all the details of this most\nadmirable and prudent plan, I felt that my heart still yearned for\nsomething; and that in order to leave nothing to desire in this most\nenchanting retirement, one ought to be able to share it with Manon.\n\n\"However, Tiberge continuing to pay me frequent visits in order to\nstrengthen me in the purpose with which he had inspired me, I took an\nopportunity of opening the subject to my father.  He declared that his\nintention ever was to leave his children free to choose a profession,\nand that in whatever manner I should dispose of myself, all he wished\nto reserve was the right of aiding me with his counsel.  On this\noccasion he gave me some of the wisest, which tended less to divert me\nfrom my project, than to convince me of my good father's sound judgment\nand discretion.\n\n\"The recommencement of the scholastic year being at hand, Tiberge and I\nagreed to enter ourselves together at St. Sulpice, he to pursue his\ntheological studies, and I to begin mine.  His merits, which were not\nunknown to the bishop of the diocese, procured him the promise of a\nliving from that prelate before our departure.\n\n\"My father, thinking me quite cured of my passion, made no objection to\nmy taking final leave.  We arrived at Paris.  The Cross of Malta gave\nplace to the ecclesiastical habit, and the designation of the Abbé de\nGrieux was substituted for that of chevalier.  I applied so diligently\nto study, that in a few months I had made extraordinary progress.  I\nnever lost a moment of the day, and employed even part of the night.  I\nsoon acquired such a reputation, that I was already congratulated upon\nthe honours which I was sure of obtaining; and, without solicitation on\nmy part, my name was inscribed on the list for a vacant benefice.\nPiety was by no means neglected, and I entered with ardent devotion\ninto all the exercises of religion.  Tiberge was proud of what he\nconsidered the work of his own hands, and many a time have I seen him\nshed tears of delight in noticing what he styled my perfect conversion.\n\n\"It has never been matter of wonder to me that human resolutions are\nliable to change; one passion gives them birth, another may destroy\nthem; but when I reflect upon the sacredness of those motives that led\nme to St. Sulpice, and upon the heartfelt satisfaction I enjoyed while\nobeying their dictation, I shudder at the facility with which I\noutraged them all.  If it be true that the benign succour afforded by\nHeaven is at all times equal to the strongest of man's pinions, I shall\nbe glad to learn the nature of the deplorable ascendancy which causes\nus suddenly to swerve from the path of duty, without the power of\noffering the least resistance, and without even the slightest\nvisitation of remorse.\n\n\"I now thought myself entirely safe from the dangers of love.  I\nfancied that I could have preferred a single page of St. Augustine, or\na quarter of an hour of Christian meditation, to every sensual\ngratification, not excepting any that I might have derived even from\nManon's society.  Nevertheless, one unlucky moment plunged me again\nheadlong into the gulf; and my ruin was the more irreparable, because,\nfalling at once to the same depth from whence I had been before\nrescued, each of the new disorders into which I now lapsed carried me\ndeeper and deeper still down the profound abyss of vice.  I had passed\nnearly a year at Paris without hearing of Manon.  It cost me no slight\neffort to abstain from enquiry; but the unintermitting advice of\nTiberge, and my own reflections, secured this victory over my wishes.\nThe last months glided away so tranquilly, that I considered the memory\nof this charming but treacherous creature about to be consigned to\neternal oblivion.\n\n\"The time arrived when I was to undergo a public examination in the\nclass of theology:  I invited several persons of consideration to\nhonour me with their presence on the occasion. My name was mentioned in\nevery quarter of Paris: it even reached the ears of her who had\nbetrayed me.  She had some difficulty in recognising it with the prefix\nof Abbé; but curiosity, or perhaps remorse for having been faithless to\nme (I could never after ascertain by which of these feelings she was\nactuated), made her at once take an interest in a name so like mine;\nand she came with several other women to the Sorbonne, where she was\npresent at my examination, and had doubtless little trouble in\nrecognising my person.\n\n\"I had not the remotest suspicion of her presence.  It is well known\nthat in these places there are private seats for ladies, where they\nremain screened by a curtain.  I returned to St. Sulpice covered with\nhonours and congratulations.  It was six in the evening.  The moment I\nreturned, a lady was announced, who desired to speak with me.  I went\nto meet her.  Heavens! what a surprise!\n\n\"It was Manon.  It was she indeed, but more bewitching and brilliant\nthan I had ever beheld her.  She was now in her eighteenth year.  Her\nbeauty beggars all description.  The exquisite grace of her form, the\nmild sweetness of expression that animated her features, and her\nengaging air, made her seem the very personification of love.  The\nvision was something too perfect for human beauty.\n\n\"I stood like one enchanted at beholding her.  Unable to divine the\nobject of her visit, I waited trembling and with downcast looks until\nshe explained herself.  At first, her embarrassment was equal to mine;\nbut, seeing that I was not disposed to break silence, she raised her\nhand to her eyes to conceal a starting tear, and then, in a timid tone,\nsaid that she well knew she had justly earned my abhorrence by her\ninfidelity; but that if I had ever really felt any love for her, there\nwas not much kindness in allowing two long years to pass without\nenquiring after her, and as little now in seeing her in the state of\nmental distress in which she was, without condescending to bestow upon\nher a single word.  I shall not attempt to describe what my feelings\nwere as I listened to this reproof.\n\n\"She seated herself.  I remained standing, with my face half turned\naside, for I could not muster courage to meet her look.  I several\ntimes commenced a reply without power to conclude it.  At length I made\nan effort, and in a tone of poignant grief exclaimed:  'Perfidious\nManon! perfidious, perfidious creature!' She had no wish, she repeated\nwith a flood of tears, to attempt to justify her infidelity.  'What is\nyour wish, then?' cried I. 'I wish to die,' she answered, 'if you will\nnot give me back that heart, without which it is impossible to endure\nlife.'  'Take my life too, then, faithless girl!'  I exclaimed, in vain\nendeavouring to restrain my tears; 'take my life also! it is the sole\nsacrifice that remains for me to make, for my heart has never ceased to\nbe thine.'\n\n\"I had hardly uttered these words, when she rose in a transport of joy,\nand approached to embrace me.  She loaded me with a thousand caresses.\nShe addressed me by all the endearing appellations with which love\nsupplies his votaries, to enable them to express the most passionate\nfondness.  I still answered with affected coldness; but the sudden\ntransition from a state of quietude, such as that I had up to this\nmoment enjoyed, to the agitation and tumult which were now kindled in\nmy breast and tingled through my veins, thrilled me with a kind of\nhorror, and impressed me with a vague sense that I was about to undergo\nsome great transformation, and to enter upon a new existence.\n\n\"We sat down close by each other.  I took her hand within mine, 'Ah!\nManon,' said I, with a look of sorrow, 'I little thought that love like\nmine could have been repaid with treachery!  It was a poor triumph to\nbetray a heart of which you were the absolute mistress--whose sole\nhappiness it was to gratify and obey you.  Tell me if among others you\nhave found any so affectionate and so devoted?  No, no!  I believe\nnature has cast few hearts in the same mould as mine.  Tell me at least\nwhether you have ever thought of me with regret!  Can I have any\nreliance on the duration of the feeling that has brought you back to me\ntoday?  I perceive too plainly that you are infinitely lovelier than\never: but I conjure you by all my past sufferings, dearest Manon, to\ntell me--can you in future be more faithful?'\n\n\"She gave me in reply such tender assurances of her repentance, and\npledged her fidelity with such solemn protestations and vows, that I\nwas inexpressibly affected.  'Beauteous Manon,' said I, with rather a\nprofane mixture of amorous and theological expressions, 'you are too\nadorable for a created being.  I feel my heart transported with\ntriumphant rapture.  It is folly to talk of liberty at St. Sulpice.\nFortune and reputation are but slight sacrifices at such a shrine!  I\nplainly foresee it: I can read my destiny in your bright eyes; but what\nabundant recompense shall I not find in your affections for any loss I\nmay sustain! The favours of fortune have no influence over me: fame\nitself appears to me but a mockery; all my projects of a holy life were\nwild absurdities: in fact, any joys but those I may hope for at your\nside are fit objects of contempt.  There are none that would not vanish\ninto worthlessness before one single glance of thine!'\n\n\"In promising her, however, a full remission of her past frailties, I\nenquired how she permitted herself to be led astray by B----.  She\ninformed me that having seen her at her window, he became passionately\nin love with her; that he made his advances in the true style of a\nmercantile cit;--that is to say, by giving her to understand in his\nletter, that his payments would be proportioned to her favours; that\nshe had admitted his overtures at first with no other intention than\nthat of getting from him such a sum as might enable us to live without\ninconvenience; but that he had so bewildered her with splendid\npromises, that she allowed herself to be misled by degrees.  She added,\nthat I ought to have formed some notion of the remorse she experienced,\nby her grief on the night of our separation; and assured me that, in\nspite of the splendour in which he maintained her, she had never known\na moment's happiness with him, not only, she said, because he was\nutterly devoid of that delicacy of sentiment and of those agreeable\nmanners which I possessed, but because even in the midst of the\namusements which he unceasingly procured her, she could never shake off\nthe recollection of my love, or her own ingratitude.  She then spoke of\nTiberge, and the extreme embarrassment his visit caused her.  'A\ndagger's point,' she added, 'could not have struck more terror to my\nheart.  I turned from him, unable to sustain the interview for a\nmoment.'\n\n\"She continued to inform me how she had been apprised of my residence\nat Paris, of the change in my condition, and of her witnessing my\nexamination at the Sorbonne.  She told me how agitated she had been\nduring my intellectual conflict with the examiner; what difficulty she\nfelt in restraining her tears as well as her sighs, which were more\nthan once on the point of spurning all control, and bursting forth;\nthat she was the last person to leave the hall of examination, for fear\nof betraying her distress, and that, following only the instinct of her\nown heart, and her ardent desires, she came direct to the seminary,\nwith the firm resolution of surrendering life itself, if she found me\ncruel enough to withhold my forgiveness.\n\n\"Could any savage remain unmoved by such proofs of cordial repentance\nas those I had just witnessed?  For my part, I felt at the moment that\nI could gladly have given up all the bishoprics in Christendom for\nManon.  I asked what course she would recommend in our present\nemergency. 'It is requisite,' she replied, 'at all events, to quit the\nseminary, and settle in some safer place.'  I consented to everything\nshe proposed.  She got into her carriage to go and wait for me at the\ncorner of the street.  I escaped the next moment, without attracting\nthe porter's notice.  I entered the carriage, and we drove off to a\nJew's.  I there resumed my lay-dress and sword.  Manon furnished the\nsupplies, for I was without a sou, and fearing that I might meet with\nsome new impediment, she would not consent to my returning to my room\nat St. Sulpice for my purse.  My finances were in truth wretchedly low,\nand hers more than sufficiently enriched by the liberality of M. de\nB---- to make her think lightly of my loss.  We consulted together at\nthe Jew's as to the course we should now adopt.\n\n\"In order to enhance the sacrifice she had made for me of her late\nlover, she determined to treat him without the least ceremony.  'I\nshall leave him all his furniture,' she said; 'it belongs to him: but I\nshall assuredly carry off, as I have a right to do, the jewels, and\nabout sixty thousand francs, which I have had from him in the last two\nyears.  I have given him no control over me,' she added, 'so that we\nmay remain without apprehension in Paris, taking a convenient house,\nwhere we shall live, oh how happily together!'\n\n\"I represented to her that, although there might be no danger for her,\nthere was a great deal for me, who must be sooner or later infallibly\nrecognised, and continually exposed to a repetition of the trials I had\nbefore endured.  She gave me to understand that she could not quit\nParis without regret.  I had such a dread of giving her annoyance, that\nthere were no risks I would not have encountered for her sake.\nHowever, we compromised matters by resolving to take a house in some\nvillage near Paris, from whence it would be easy for us to come into\ntown whenever pleasure or business required it.  We fixed on Chaillot,\nwhich is at a convenient distance.  Manon at once returned to her\nhouse, and I went to wait for her at a side-gate of the garden of the\nTuileries.\n\n\"She returned an hour after, in a hired carriage, with a servant-maid,\nand several trunks, which contained her dresses, and everything she had\nof value.\n\n\"We were not long on our way to Chaillot.  We lodged the first night at\nthe inn, in order to have time to find a suitable house, or at least a\ncommodious lodging.  We found one to our taste the next morning.\n\n\"My happiness now appeared to be secured beyond the reach of fate.\nManon was everything most sweet and amiable.  She was so delicate and\nso unceasing in her attentions to me, that I deemed myself but too\nbountifully rewarded for all my past troubles.  As we had both, by this\ntime, acquired some experience, we discussed rationally the state of\nour finances.  Sixty thousand francs (the amount of our wealth) was not\na sum that could be expected to last our whole life; besides, we were\nneither of us much disposed to control our expenses.  Manon's chief\nvirtue assuredly was not economy, any more than it was mine.  This was\nmy proposition. 'Sixty thousand francs,' said I, 'may support us for\nten years. Two thousand crowns a year will suffice, if we continue to\nlive at Chaillot.  We shall keep up appearances, but live frugally. Our\nonly expense will be occasionally a carriage, and the theatres.  We\nshall do everything in moderation.  You like the opera; we shall go\ntwice a week, in the season.  As for play, we shall limit ourselves; so\nthat our losses must never exceed three crowns.  It is impossible but\nthat in the space of ten years some change must occur in my family: my\nfather is even now of an advanced age; he may die; in which event I\nmust inherit a fortune, and we shall then be above all other fears.'\n\n\"This arrangement would not have been by any means the most silly act\nof my life, if we had only been prudent enough to persevere in its\nexecution; but our resolutions hardly lasted longer than a month.\nManon's passion was for amusement; she was the only object of mine.\nNew temptations to expense constantly presented themselves, and far\nfrom regretting the money which she sometimes prodigally lavished, I\nwas the first to procure for her everything likely to afford her\npleasure.  Our residence at Chaillot began even to appear tiresome.\n\n\"Winter was approaching, and the whole world returning to town; the\ncountry had a deserted look.  She proposed to me to take a house in\nParis.  I did not approve of this; but, in order partly at least to\nsatisfy her, I said that we might hire furnished apartments, and that\nwe might sleep there whenever we were late in quitting the assembly,\nwhither we often went; for the inconvenience of returning so late to\nChaillot was her excuse for wishing to leave it.  We had thus two\ndwellings, one in town and the other in the country.  This change soon\nthrew our affairs into confusion, and led to two adventures, which\neventually caused our ruin.\n\n\"Manon had a brother in the Guards.  He unfortunately lived in the very\nstreet in which we had taken lodgings.  He one day recognised his\nsister at the window, and hastened over to us.  He was a fellow of the\nrudest manners, and without the slightest principle of honour.  He\nentered the room swearing in the most horrible way; and as he knew part\nof his sister's history, he loaded her with abuse and reproaches.\n\n\"I had gone out the moment before, which was doubtless fortunate for\neither him or me, for I was little disposed to brook an insult.  I only\nreturned to the lodgings after he had left them. The low spirits in\nwhich I found Manon convinced me at once that something extraordinary\nhad occurred.  She told me of the provoking scene she had just gone\nthrough, and of the brutal threats of her brother.  I felt such\nindignation, that I wished to proceed at once to avenge her, when she\nentreated me with tears to desist.\n\n\"While we were still talking of the adventure, the guardsman again\nentered the room in which we sat, without even waiting to be announced.\nHad I known him, he should not have met from me as civil a reception as\nhe did; but saluting us with a smile upon his countenance, he addressed\nhimself to Manon, and said, he was come to make excuses for his\nviolence; that he had supposed her to be living a life of shame and\ndisgrace, and it was this notion that excited his rage; but having\nsince made enquiry from one of our servants, he had learned such a\ncharacter of me, that his only wish was now to be on terms with us both.\n\n\"Although this admission, of having gone for information to one of my\nown servants, had in it something ludicrous as well as indelicate, I\nacknowledged his compliments with civility, I thought by doing so to\nplease Manon, and I was not deceived--she was delighted at the\nreconciliation.  We made him stay to dine with us.\n\n\"In a little time he became so familiar, that hearing us speak of our\nreturn to Chaillot, he insisted on accompanying us.  We were obliged to\ngive him a seat in our carriage.  This was in fact putting him into\npossession, for he soon began to feel so much pleasure in our company,\nthat he made our house his home, and made himself in some measure\nmaster of all that belonged to us.  He called me his brother, and,\nunder the semblance of fraternal freedom, he put himself on such a\nfooting as to introduce all his friends without ceremony into our house\nat Chaillot, and there entertain them at our expense.  His magnificent\nuniforms were procured of my tailor and charged to me, and he even\ncontrived to make Manon and me responsible for all his debts.  I\npretended to be blind to this system of tyranny, rather than annoy\nManon, and even to take no notice of the sums of money which from time\nto time he received from her. No doubt, as he played very deep, he was\nhonest enough to repay her a part sometimes, when luck turned in his\nfavour; but our finances were utterly inadequate to supply, for any\nlength of time, demands of such magnitude and frequency.\n\n\"I was on the point of coming to an understanding with him, in order to\nput an end to the system, when an unfortunate accident saved me that\ntrouble, by involving us in inextricable ruin.\n\n\"One night we stopped in Paris to sleep, as it had now indeed become\nour constant habit.  The servant-maid who on such occasions remained\nalone at Chaillot, came early the next morning to inform me that our\nhouse had taken fire in the night, and that the flames had been\nextinguished with great difficulty.  I asked whether the furniture had\nsuffered.  She answered, that there had been such confusion, owing to\nthe multitude of strangers who came to offer assistance, that she could\nhardly ascertain what damage had been done.  I was principally uneasy\nabout our money, which had been locked up in a little box.  I went off\nin haste to Chaillot.  Vain hope! the box had disappeared!\n\n\"I discovered that one could love money without being a miser. This\nloss afflicted me to such a degree that I was almost out of my mind.  I\nsaw at one glance to what new calamities I should be exposed: poverty\nwas the least of them.  I knew Manon thoroughly; I had already had\nabundant proof that, although faithful and attached to me under happier\ncircumstances, she could not be depended upon in want: pleasure and\nplenty she loved too well to sacrifice them for my sake.  'I shall lose\nher!' I cried; 'miserable chevalier! you are about then to lose all\nthat you love on earth!'  This thought agitated me to such a degree\nthat I actually for some moments considered whether it would not be\nbest for me to end at once all my miseries by death.  I however\npreserved presence of mind enough to reflect whether I was entirely\nwithout resource, and an idea occurred to me which quieted my despair.\nIt would not be impossible, I thought, to conceal our loss from Manon;\nand I might perhaps discover some ways and means of supplying her, so\nas to ward off the inconveniences of poverty.\n\n\"I had calculated in endeavouring to comfort myself, that twenty\nthousand crowns would support us for ten years.  Suppose that these ten\nyears had now elapsed, and that none of the events which I had looked\nfor in my family had occurred.  What then would have been my course?  I\nhardly know; but whatever I should then have done, why may I not do\nnow?  How many are there in Paris, who have neither my talents, nor the\nnatural advantages I possess, and who, notwithstanding, owe their\nsupport to the exercise of their talents, such as they are?\n\n\"'Has not Providence,' I added, while reflecting on the different\nconditions of life, 'arranged things wisely?'  The greater number of\nthe powerful and the rich are fools.  No one who knows anything of the\nworld can doubt that.  How admirable is the compensating justice\nthereof!  If wealth brought with it talent also, the rich would be too\nhappy, and other men too wretched.  To these latter are given personal\nadvantages and genius, to help them out of misery and want.  Some of\nthem share the riches of the wealthy by administering to their\npleasures, or by making them their dupes; others afford them\ninstruction, and endeavour to make them decent members of society; to\nbe sure, they do not always succeed; but that was probably not the\nintention of the divine wisdom.  In every case they derive a benefit\nfrom their labours by living at the expense of their pupils; and, in\nwhatever point of view it is considered, the follies of the rich are a\nbountiful source of revenue to the humbler classes.\n\n\"These thoughts restored me a little to my spirits and to my reason.  I\ndetermined first to consult M. Lescaut, the brother of Manon.  He knew\nParis perfectly; and I had too many opportunities of learning that it\nwas neither from his own estates, nor from the king's pay, that he\nderived the principal portion of his income.  I had about thirty-three\ncrowns left, which I fortunately happened to have about me.  I showed\nhim my purse, and explained to him my misfortune and my fears, and then\nasked him whether I had any alternative between starvation and blowing\nout my brains in despair.  He coolly replied that suicide was the\nresource of fools.  As to dying of want, there were hundreds of men of\ngenius who found themselves reduced to that state when they would not\nemploy their talents; that it was for myself to discover what I was\ncapable of doing, and he told me to reckon upon his assistance and his\nadvice in any enterprise I might undertake.\n\n\"'Vague enough, M. Lescaut!' said I to him: 'my wants demand a more\nspeedy remedy; for what am I to say to Manon?'  'Apropos of Manon,'\nreplied he, 'what is it that annoys you about her? Cannot you always\nfind in her wherewithal to meet your wants, when you wish it?  Such a\nperson ought to support us all, you and me as well as herself.'  He cut\nshort the answer which I was about to give to such unfeeling and brutal\nimpertinence, by going on to say, that before night he would ensure me\na thousand crowns to divide between us, if I would only follow his\nadvice; that he was acquainted with a nobleman, who was so liberal in\naffairs of the kind, that he was certain he would not hesitate for a\nmoment to give the sum named for the favours of such a girl as Manon.\n\n\"I stopped him.  'I had a better opinion of you,' said I; 'I had\nimagined that your motive for bestowing your friendship upon me was\nvery different indeed from the one you now betray.'  With the greatest\neffrontery he acknowledged that he had been always of the same mind,\nand that his sister having once sacrificed her virtue, though it might\nbe to the man she most loved, he would never have consented to a\nreconciliation with her, but with the hope of deriving some advantage\nfrom her past misconduct.\n\n\"It was easy to see that we had been hitherto his dupes.\nNotwithstanding the disgust with which his proposition inspired me,\nstill, as I felt that I had occasion for his services, I said, with\napparent complacency, that we ought only to entertain such a plan as a\nlast resource.  I begged of him to suggest some other.\n\n\"He proposed to me to turn my youth and the good looks nature had\nbestowed upon me to some account, by establishing a liaison with some\ngenerous old dame.  This was just as little to my taste, for it would\nnecessarily have rendered me unfaithful to Manon.\n\n\"I mentioned play as the easiest scheme, and the most suitable to my\npresent situation.  He admitted that play certainly was a resource, but\nthat it was necessary to consider the point well. 'Mere play,' said he,\n'with its ordinary chances, is the certain road to ruin; and as for\nattempting, alone and without an ally, to employ the little means an\nadroit man has for correcting the vagaries of luck, it would be too\ndangerous an experiment.' There was, he stated, a third course, which\nwas to enter into what he called a partnership; but he feared his\nconfederates would consider my youth an objection to my admittance.\nHe, however, promised to use his influence with them; and, what was\nmore than I expected at his hands, he said that he would supply me with\na little money whenever I had pressing occasion for any. The only\nfavour I then asked of him was to say nothing to Manon of the loss I\nhad experienced, nor of the subject of our conversation.\n\n\"I certainly derived little comfort from my visit to Lescaut; I felt\neven sorry for having confided my secret to him: not a single thing had\nhe done for me that I might not just as well have done for myself,\nwithout troubling him; and I could not help dreading that he would\nviolate his promise to keep the secret from Manon.  I had also reason\nto apprehend, from his late avowals, that he might form the design of\nmaking use of her for his own vile purposes, or at least of advising\nher to quit me for some happier and more wealthy lover.  This idea\nbrought in its train a thousand reflections, which had no other effect\nthan to torment me, and throw me again into the state of despair in\nwhich I had passed the morning.  It occurred to me, more than once, to\nwrite to my father; and to pretend a new reformation, in order to\nobtain some pecuniary assistance from him; but I could not forget that,\nnotwithstanding all his natural love and affection for me, he had shut\nme up for six months in a confined room for my first transgression; and\nI was certain that, after the scandalous sensation caused by my flight\nfrom St. Sulpice, he would be sure to treat me with infinitely more\nrigour now.\n\n\"At length, out of this chaos of fancies came an idea that all at once\nrestored ease to my mind, and which I was surprised at not having hit\nupon sooner; this was, to go again to my friend Tiberge, in whom I\nmight be always sure of finding the same unfailing zeal and friendship.\nThere is nothing more glorious--nothing that does more honour to true\nvirtue, than the confidence with which one approaches a friend of tried\nintegrity; no apprehension, no risk of unkind repulse: if it be not\nalways in his power to afford the required succour, one is sure at\nleast of meeting kindness and compassion.  The heart of the poor\nsupplicant, which remains impenetrably closed to the rest of the world,\nopens in his presence, as a flower expands before the orb of day, from\nwhich it instinctively knows it can derive a cheering and benign\ninfluence only.\n\n\"I consider it a blessing to have thought so apropos of Tiberge, and\nresolved to take measures to find him before evening.  I returned at\nonce to my lodgings to write him a line, and fix a convenient place for\nour meeting.  I requested secrecy and discretion, as the most important\nservice he could render me under present circumstances.\n\n\"The pleasure I derived from the prospect of seeing Tiberge dissipated\nevery trace of melancholy, which Manon would not have failed otherwise\nto detect in my countenance.  I described our misfortune at Chaillot as\na trifle which ought not to annoy her; and Paris being the spot she\nliked best in the world, she was not sorry to hear me say that it would\nbe necessary for us to remain there entirely, until the little damage\nwas repaired which had been caused by the fire at Chaillot.\n\n\"In an hour I received an answer from Tiberge, who promised to be at\nthe appointed rendezvous.  I went there punctually.  I certainly felt\nsome shame at encountering a friend whose presence alone ought to be a\nreproach to my iniquities; but I was supported by the opinion I had of\nthe goodness of his heart, as well as by my anxiety about Manon.\n\n\"I had begged of him to meet me in the garden of the Palais Royal.  He\nwas there before me.  He hastened towards me, the moment he saw me\napproach and shook me warmly by both hands.  I said that I could not\nhelp feeling perfectly ashamed to meet him, and that I was weighed down\nby a sense of my ingratitude; that the first thing I implored of him\nwas to tell me whether I might still consider him my friend, after\nhaving so justly incurred the loss of his esteem and affection.  He\nreplied, in the kindest possible manner, that it was not in the nature\nof things to destroy his regard for me; that my misfortunes even, or,\nif he might so call them, my faults and transgressions, had but\nincreased the interest he felt for me; but that he must confess his\naffection was not unalloyed by a sentiment of the liveliest sorrow,\nsuch as a person may be supposed to feel at seeing a beloved object on\nthe brink of ruin, and beyond the reach of his assistance.\n\n\"We sat down upon a bench.  'Alas!' said I with a deep sigh, 'your\ncompassion must be indeed great, my dear Tiberge, if you assure me it\nis equal to my sufferings.  I am almost ashamed to recount them, for I\nconfess they have been brought on by no very creditable course of\nconduct: the results, however, are so truly melancholy, that a friend\neven less attached than you would be affected by the recital.'\n\n\"He then begged of me, in proof of friendship, to let him know, without\nany disguise, all that had occurred to me since my departure from St.\nSulpice.  I gratified him; and so far from concealing anything, or\nattempting to extenuate my faults, I spoke of my passion with all the\nardour with which it still inspired me.  I represented it to him as one\nof those especial visitations of fate, which draw on the devoted victim\nto his ruin, and which it is as impossible for virtue itself to resist,\nas for human wisdom to foresee.  I painted to him in the most vivid\ncolours, my excitement, my fears, the state of despair in which I had\nbeen two hours before I saw him, and into which I should be again\nplunged, if I found my friends as relentless as fate had been.  I at\nlength made such an impression upon poor Tiberge, that I saw he was as\nmuch affected by compassion, as I by the recollection of my sufferings.\n\n\"He took my hand, and exhorted me to have courage and be comforted;\nbut, as he seemed to consider it settled that Manon and I were to\nseparate, I gave him at once to understand that it was that very\nseparation I considered as the most intolerable of all my misfortunes;\nand that I was ready to endure not only the last degree of misery, but\ndeath itself, of the cruellest kind, rather than seek relief in a\nremedy worse than the whole accumulation of my woes.\n\n\"'Explain yourself, then,' said he to me; 'what assistance can I afford\nyou, if you reject everything I propose?'  I had not courage to tell\nhim that it was from his purse I wanted relief. He, however,\ncomprehended it in the end; and acknowledging that he believed he now\nunderstood me, he remained for a moment in an attitude of thought, with\nthe air of a person revolving something in his mind.  'Do not imagine,'\nhe presently said, 'that my hesitation arises from any diminution of my\nzeal and friendship; but to what an alternative do you now reduce me,\nsince I must either refuse you the assistance you ask, or violate my\nmost sacred duty in affording it!  For is it not participating in your\nsin to furnish you with the means of continuing its indulgence?'\n\n\"'However,' continued he, after a moment's thought, 'it is perhaps the\nexcited state into which want has thrown you, that denies you now the\nliberty of choosing the proper path.  Man's mind must be at rest, to\nknow the luxury of wisdom and virtue.  I can afford to let you have\nsome money; and permit me, my dear chevalier, to impose but one\ncondition; that is, that you let me know the place of your abode, and\nallow me the opportunity of using my exertions to reclaim you.  I know\nthat there is in your heart a love of virtue, and that you have been\nonly led astray by the violence of your passions.'\n\n\"I, of course, agreed to everything he asked, and only begged of him to\ndeplore the malign destiny which rendered me callous to the counsels of\nso virtuous a friend.  He then took me to a banker of his acquaintance,\nwho gave one hundred and seventy crowns for his note of hand, which was\ntaken as cash.  I have already said that he was not rich.  His living\nwas worth about six thousand francs a year, but as this was the first\nyear since his induction, he had as yet touched none of the receipts,\nand it was out of the future income that he made me this advance.\n\n\"I felt the full force of his generosity, even to such a degree as\nalmost to deplore the fatal passion which thus led me to break through\nall the restraints of duty.  Virtue had for a moment the ascendancy in\nmy heart, and made me sensible of my shame and degradation.  But this\nwas soon over.  For Manon I could have given up my hopes of heaven, and\nwhen I again found myself at her side, I wondered how I could for an\ninstant have considered myself degraded by my passion for this\nenchanting girl.\n\n\"Manon was a creature of most extraordinary disposition.  Never had\nmortal a greater contempt for money, and yet she was haunted by\nperpetual dread of wanting it.  Her only desire was for pleasure and\namusement.  She would never have wished to possess a sou, if pleasure\ncould be procured without money.  She never even cared what our purse\ncontained, provided she could pass the day agreeably; so that, being\nneither fond of play nor at all dazzled by the desire of great wealth,\nnothing was more easy than to satisfy her, by daily finding out\namusements suited to her moderate wishes.  But it became by habit a\nthing so absolutely necessary for her to have her mind thus occupied,\nthat, without it, it was impossible to exercise the smallest influence\nover her temper or inclinations.  Although she loved me tenderly, and I\nwas the only person, as she often declared, in whose society she could\never find the pure enjoyments of love, yet I felt thoroughly convinced\nthat her attachment could not withstand certain apprehensions.  She\nwould have preferred me, even with a moderate fortune, to the whole\nworld; but I had no kind of doubt that she would, on the other hand,\nabandon me for some new M. de B----, when I had nothing more to offer\nher than fidelity and love.\n\n\"I resolved therefore so to curtail my own individual expenses, as to\nbe able always to meet hers, and rather to deprive myself of a thousand\nnecessaries than even to limit her extravagance. The carriage made me\nmore uneasy than anything else, for I saw no chance of being able to\nmaintain either coachman or horses.\n\n\"I told M. Lescaut of my difficulties, and did not conceal from him\nthat I had received a thousand francs from a friend.  He repeated, that\nif I wished to try the chances of the gaming-table, he was not without\nhopes that, by spending a few crowns in entertaining his associates, I\nmight be, on his recommendation, admitted into the association.  With\nall my repugnance to cheating, I yielded to dire necessity.\n\n\"Lescaut presented me that night as a relation of his own.  He added,\nthat I was the more likely to succeed in my new profession, from\nwanting the favours of fortune.  However, to show them that I was not\nquite reduced to the lowest ebb, he said it was my intention to treat\nthem with a supper.  The offer was accepted, and I entertained them en\nprince.  They talked a good deal about my fashionable appearance and\nthe apparent amiability of my disposition; they said that the best\nhopes might be entertained of me, because there was something in my\ncountenance that bespoke the gentleman, and no one therefore could have\na suspicion of my honesty: they voted thanks to Lescaut for having\nintroduced so promising a novice, and deputed one of the members to\ninstruct me for some days in the necessary manoeuvres.\n\n\"The principal scene of my exploits was the hotel of Transylvania,\nwhere there was a faro table in one room, and other games of cards and\ndice in the gallery.  This academy was kept by the Prince of R----, who\nthen lived at Clagny, and most of his officers belonged to our society.\nShall I mention it to my shame?  I profited quickly by my instructor's\ntuition.  I acquired an amazing facility in sleight of hand tricks, and\nlearned in perfection to sauter le coup; with the help of a pair of\nlong ruffles, I shuffled so adroitly as to defy the quickest observer,\nand I ruined several fair players.  My unrivalled skill so quickened\nthe progress of my fortunes, that I found myself master, in a few\nweeks, of very considerable sums, besides what I divided in good faith\nwith my companions.\n\n\"I had no longer any fear of communicating to Manon the extent of our\nloss at Chaillot, and, to console her on the announcement of such\ndisastrous news, I took a furnished house, where we established\nourselves in all the pride of opulence and security.\n\n\"Tiberge was in the habit, at this period, of paying me frequent\nvisits.  He was never tired of his moral lectures.  Over and over again\ndid he represent to me the injury I was inflicting upon my conscience,\nmy honour, and my fortune.  I received all his advice kindly, and\nalthough I had not the smallest inclination to adopt it, I had no doubt\nof its sincerity, for I knew its source. Sometimes I rallied him\ngood-humouredly, and entreated him not to be more tight-laced than some\nother priests were, and even bishops, who by no means considered a\nmistress incompatible with a good and holy life.'  'Look,' I said, 'at\nManon's eyes, and tell me if there is one in the long catalogue of sins\nthat might not there find a plea of justification.'  He bore these\nsallies patiently, and carried his forbearance almost too far: but when\nhe saw my funds increase, and that I had not only returned him the\nhundred and seventy crowns, but having hired a new house and trebled my\nexpenses, I had plunged deeper than ever into a life of pleasure, he\nchanged his tone and manner towards me.  He lamented my obduracy.  He\nwarned me against the chastisement of the Divine wrath, and predicted\nsome of the miseries with which indeed I was shortly afterwards\nvisited.  'It is impossible,' he said, 'that the money which now serves\nto support your debaucheries can have been acquired honourably.  You\nhave come by it unjustly, and in the same way shall it be taken from\nyou.  The most awful punishment Heaven could inflict would be to allow\nyou the undisturbed enjoyment of it.  All my advice,' he added, 'has\nbeen useless; I too plainly perceive that it will shortly become\ntroublesome to you.  I now take my leave; you are a weak, as well as an\nungrateful friend!  May your criminal enjoyments vanish as a shadow!\nmay your ill-gotten wealth leave you without a resource; and may you\nyourself remain alone and deserted, to learn the vanity of these\nthings, which now divert you from better pursuits!  When that time\narrives, you will find me disposed to love and to serve you; this day\nends our intercourse, and I once for all avow my horror of the life you\nare leading.'\n\n\"It was in my room and in Manon's presence that he delivered this\napostolical harangue.  He rose to depart.  I was about to detain him;\nbut was prevented by Manon, who said it was better to let the madman go.\n\n\"What he said, however, did not fail to make some impression upon me.\nI notice these brief passages of my life when I experienced a returning\nsentiment of virtue, because it was to those traces, however light,\nthat I was afterwards indebted for whatever of fortitude I displayed\nunder the most trying circumstances.\n\n\"Manon's caresses soon dissipated the annoyance this scene had caused\nme.  We continued to lead a life entirely devoted to pleasure and love.\nThe increase of our wealth only redoubled our affection.  There were none\nhappier among all the devotees of Venus and Fortune.  Heavens! why call\nthis a world of misery, when it can furnish a life of such rapturous\nenjoyment?  But alas, it is too soon over!  For what ought man to sigh,\ncould such felicity but last for ever?  Ours shared the common fate--in\nbeing of short duration, and followed by lasting regrets.\n\n\"I had realised by play such a considerable sum of money, that I\nthought of investing a portion of it.  My servants were not ignorant of\nmy good luck, particularly my valet and Manon's own maid, before whom\nwe often talked without any reserve.  The maid was handsome, and my\nvalet in love with her.  They knew they had to deal with a young and\ninexperienced couple, whom they fancied they could impose upon without\nmuch difficulty.  They laid a plan, and executed it with so much skill,\nthat they reduced us to a state from which it was never afterwards\npossible for us to extricate ourselves.\n\n\"Having supped one evening at Lescaut's, it was about midnight when we\nreturned home.  I asked for my valet, and Manon for her maid; neither\none nor the other could be found.  They had not been seen in the house\nsince eight o'clock, and had gone out, after having some cases carried\nbefore them, according to orders which they pretended to have received\nfrom me.  I at once foresaw a part of the truth, but my suspicions were\ninfinitely surpassed by what presented itself on going into my room.\nThe lock of my closet had been forced, and my cash as well as my best\nclothes were gone.  While I stood stupefied with amazement, Manon came,\nin the greatest alarm, to inform me that her apartment had been rifled\nin the same manner.\n\n\"This blow was so perfectly astounding, so cruel, that it was with\ndifficulty I could refrain from tears.  The dread of infecting Manon\nwith my despair made me assume a more contented air.  I said, smiling,\nthat I should avenge myself upon some unhappy dupe at the hotel of\nTransylvania.  However, she appeared so sensibly affected, that her\ngrief increased my sorrow infinitely more than my attempt succeeded in\nsupporting her spirits.  'We are destroyed!' said she, with tears in\nher eyes. I endeavoured, in vain, by my entreaties and caresses, to\nconsole her.  My own lamentations betrayed my distress and despair.  In\nfact, we were so completely ruined, that we were bereft almost of\ndecent covering.\n\n\"I determined to send off at once for Lescaut.  He advised me to go\nimmediately to the lieutenant of police, and to give information also\nto the Grand Provost of Paris.  I went, but it was to add to my\ncalamities only; for, independently of my visit producing not the\nsmallest good effect, I, by my absence, allowed Lescaut time for\ndiscussion with his sister, during which he did not fail to inspire her\nwith the most horrible resolutions.  He spoke to her about M. G----\nM----, an old voluptuary, who paid prodigally for his pleasures; he so\nglowingly described the advantages of such a connection, that she\nentered into all his plans.  This discreditable arrangement was all\nconcluded before my return, and the execution of it only postponed till\nthe next morning, after Lescaut should have apprised G---- M----.\n\n\"I found him, on my return, waiting for me at my house; but Manon had\nretired to her own apartment, and she had desired the footman to tell\nme that, having need of repose, she hoped she should not be disturbed\nthat night.  Lescaut left me, after offering me a few crowns which I\naccepted.\n\n\"It was nearly four o'clock when I retired to bed; and having revolved\nin my mind various schemes for retrieving my fortunes, I fell asleep so\nlate that I did not awake till between eleven and twelve o'clock.  I\nrose at once to enquire after Manon's health; they told me that she had\ngone out an hour before with her brother, who had come for her in a\nhired carriage.  Although there appeared something mysterious in such a\nproceeding, I endeavoured to check my rising suspicions.  I allowed\nsome hours to pass, during which I amused myself with reading.  At\nlength, being unable any longer to stifle my uneasiness, I paced up and\ndown the apartments.  A sealed letter upon Manon's table at last caught\nmy eye.  It was addressed to me, and in her handwriting. I felt my\nblood freeze as I opened it; it was in these words:\n\n\nI protest to you, dearest chevalier, that you are the idol of my heart,\nand that you are the only being on earth whom I can truly love; but do\nyou not see, my own poor dear chevalier, that in the situation to which\nwe are now reduced, fidelity would be worse than madness?  Do you think\ntenderness possibly compatible with starvation?  For my part, hunger\nwould be sure to drive me to some fatal end.  Heaving some day a sigh\nfor love, I should find it was my last.  I adore you, rely upon that;\nbut leave to me, for a short while, the management of our fortunes.\nGod help the man who falls into my hands.  My only wish is to render my\nchevalier rich and happy.  My brother will tell you about me; he can\nvouch for my grief in yielding to the necessity of parting from you.\n\n\n\"I remained, after reading this, in a state which it would be difficult\nto describe; for even now I know not the nature of the feelings which\nthen agitated me.  It was one of those unique situations of which\nothers can never have experienced anything even approaching to\nsimilarity.  It is impossible to explain it, because other persons can\nhave no idea of its nature; and one can hardly even analyse it to\noneself.  Memory furnishes nothing that will connect it with the past,\nand therefore ordinary language is inadequate to describe it.  Whatever\nwas its nature, however, it is certain that grief, hate, jealousy, and\nshame entered into its composition.  Fortunate would it have proved for\nme if love also had not been a component part!\n\n\"'That she loves me,' I exclaimed, 'I can believe; but could she,\nwithout being a monster, hate me?  What right can man ever have to\nwoman's affections which I had not to Manon's?  What is left to me,\nafter all the sacrifices I have made for her sake? Yet she abandons me,\nand the ungrateful creature thinks to screen herself from my reproaches\nby professions of love!  She pretends to dread starvation!  God of\nlove, what grossness of sentiment! What an answer to the refinement of\nmy adoration!  I had no dread of that kind; I, who have almost sought\nstarvation for her sake, by renouncing fortune and the comforts of my\nfather's house!  I, who denied myself actual necessaries, in order to\ngratify her little whims and caprices!  She adores me, she says.  If\nyou adored me, ungrateful creature, I well know what course you would\nhave taken; you would never have quitted me, at least without saying\nadieu.  It is only I who can tell the pangs and torments, of being\nseparated from all one loves.  I must have taken leave of my senses, to\nhave voluntarily brought all this misery upon myself.'\n\n\"My lamentations were interrupted by a visit I little expected; it was\nfrom Lescaut.  'Assassin!' cried I, putting my hand upon my sword,\n'where is Manon? what have you done with her?'  My agitation startled\nhim.  He replied, that if this was the reception he was to meet, when\nhe came to offer me the most essential service it was in his power to\nrender me, he should take his leave, and never again cross my\nthreshold.  I ran to the door of the apartment, which I shut. 'Do not\nimagine,' I said, turning towards him, 'that you can once more make a\ndupe of me with your lies and inventions.  Either defend your life, or\ntell me where I can find Manon.'  'How impatient you are!' replied he;\n'that was in reality the object of my visit.  I came to announce a\npiece of good fortune which you little expected, and for which you will\nprobably feel somewhat grateful.'  My curiosity was at once excited.\n\n\"He informed me that Manon, totally unable to endure the dread of want,\nand, above all, the certainty of being at once obliged to dispense with\nher equipage, had begged of him to make her acquainted with M. G----\nM----, who had a character for liberality.  He carefully avoided\ntelling me that this was the result of his own advice, and that he had\nprepared the way before he introduced his sister.  'I took her there\nthis morning,' said he, 'and the fellow was so enchanted with her looks\nthat he at once invited her to accompany him to his country seat, where\nhe is gone to pass some days.  As I plainly perceived,' said Lescaut,\n'the advantage it may be to you, I took care to let him know that she\nhad lately experienced very considerable losses; and I so piqued his\ngenerosity that he began by giving her four hundred crowns.  I told him\nthat was well enough for a commencement, but that my sister would have,\nfor the future, many demands for money; that she had the charge of a\nyoung brother, who had been thrown upon her hands since the death of\nour parents; and that, if he wished to prove himself worthy of her\naffections, he would not allow her to suffer uneasiness upon account of\nthis child, whom she regarded as part of herself. This speech produced\nits effect, he at once promised to take a house for you and Manon, for\nyou must know that you are the poor little orphan.  He undertook to set\nyou up in furniture, and to give you four hundred livres a month, which\nif I calculate rightly, will amount to four thousand eight hundred per\nannum. He left orders with his steward to look out for a house, and to\nhave it in readiness by the time he returned.  You will soon,\ntherefore, again see Manon, who begged of me to give you a thousand\ntender messages, and to assure you that she loves you more dearly than\never.'\"\n\n\n\nV\n\n  Infected with that leprosy of lust,\n  Which taints the hoariest years of vicious men\n  Making them ransack to the very last\n  The dregs of pleasure for their vanished joys.\n        BYRON.\n\n\n\"On sitting down to reflect upon this strange turn of fate, I found\nmyself so perplexed, and consequently so incapable of arriving at any\nrational conclusion, that I allowed Lescaut to put repeated questions\nto me without in the slightest degree attending to their purport.  It\nwas then that honour and virtue made me feel the most poignant remorse,\nand that I recalled with bitterness Amiens, my father's house, St.\nSulpice, and every spot where I had ever lived in happy innocence.  By\nwhat a terrific interval was I now separated from that blessed state!\nI beheld it no longer but as a dim shadow in the distance, still\nattracting my regrets and desires, but without the power of rousing me\nto exertion.  'By what fatality,' said I, 'have I become thus degraded?\nLove is not a guilty passion! why then has it been to me the source of\nprofligacy and distress?  Who prevented me from leading a virtuous and\ntranquil life with Manon?  Why did I not marry her before I obtained\nany concession from her love?  Would not my father, who had the\ntenderest regard for me, have given his consent, if I had taken the\nfair and candid course of soliciting him?  Yes, my father would himself\nhave cherished her as one far too good to be his son's wife!  I should\nhave been happy in the love of Manon, in the affection of my father, in\nthe esteem of the world, with a moderate portion of the good things of\nlife, and above all with the consciousness of virtue.  Disastrous\nchange!  Into what an infamous character is it here proposed that I\nshould sink?  To share----  But can I hesitate, if Manon herself\nsuggests it, and if I am to lose her except upon such conditions?\n'Lescaut,' said I, putting my hands to my eyes as if to shut out such a\nhorrifying vision, 'if your intention was to render me a service, I\ngive you thanks.  You might perhaps have struck out a more reputable\ncourse, but it is so settled, is it not?  Let us then only think of\nprofiting by your labour, and fulfilling your engagements.'\n\n\"Lescaut, who had been considerably embarrassed, not only by my fury,\nbut by the long silence which followed it, was too happy to see me now\ntake a course so different from what he had anticipated.  He had not a\nparticle of courage, of which indeed I have, in the sequel of my story,\nabundant proof.  'Yes, yes,' he quickly answered, 'it is good service I\nhave rendered you, and you will find that we shall derive infinitely\nmore advantage from it than you now expect.'  We consulted then as to\nthe best mode of preventing the suspicions which G---- M---- might\nentertain of our relationship, when he found me older and of riper\nmanhood than he probably imagined.  The only plan we could hit upon was\nto assume in his presence an innocent and provincial air, and to\npersuade him that it was my intention to enter the Church, and that\nwith that view I was obliged to go every day to the college. We also\ndetermined that I should appear as awkward as I possibly could the\nfirst time I was admitted to the honour of an introduction.\n\n\"He returned to town three or four days after, and at once conducted\nManon to the house which his steward had in the meantime prepared.  She\nimmediately apprised Lescaut of her return, and he having informed me,\nwe went together to her new abode.  The old lover had already gone out.\n\n\"In spite of the submission with which I had resigned myself to her\nwishes, I could not, at our meeting, repress the compunctious visitings\nof my conscience.  I appeared before her grieved and dejected.  The joy\nI felt at seeing her once more could not altogether dispel my sorrow\nfor her infidelity: she, on the contrary, appeared transported with the\npleasure of seeing me. She accused me of coldness.  I could not help\nmuttering the words perfidious and unfaithful, though they were\nprofusely mixed with sighs.\n\n\"At first she laughed at me for my simplicity; but when she found that\nI continued to look at her with an unchanging expression of melancholy,\nand that I could not bring myself to enter with alacrity into a scene\nso repugnant to all my feelings, she went alone into her boudoir.  I\nvery soon followed her, and then I found her in a flood of tears.  I\nasked the cause of her sorrow.  'You can easily understand it,' said\nshe; 'how can you wish me to live, if my presence can no longer have\nany other effect than to give you an air of sadness and chagrin?  Not\none kiss have you given me during the long hour you have been in the\nhouse, while you have received my caresses with the dignified\nindifference of a Grand Turk, receiving the forced homage of the\nSultanas of his harem.'\n\n\"'Hearken to me, Manon,' said I, embracing her; 'I cannot conceal from\nyou that my heart is bitterly afflicted.  I do not now allude to the\nuneasiness your sudden flight caused me, nor to the unkindness of\nquitting me without a word of consolation, after having passed the\nnight away from me.  The pleasure of seeing you again would more than\ncompensate for all; but do you imagine that I can reflect without sighs\nand tears upon the degrading and unhappy life which you now wish me to\nlead in this house?  Say nothing of my birth, or of my feelings of\nhonour; love like mine derives no aid from arguments of that feeble\nnature; but do you imagine that I can without emotion see my love so\nbadly recompensed, or rather so cruelly treated, by an ungrateful and\nunfeeling mistress?'\n\n\"She interrupted me. 'Stop, chevalier,' said she, 'it is useless to\ntorture me with reproaches, which, coming from you, always pierce my\nheart.  I see what annoys you.  I had hoped that you would have agreed\nto the project which I had devised for mending our shattered fortunes,\nand it was from a feeling of delicacy to you that I began the execution\nof it without your assistance; but I give it up since it does not meet\nyour approbation.'  She added that she would now merely request a\nlittle patient forbearance during the remainder of the day; that she\nhad already received five hundred crowns from the old gentleman, and\nthat he had promised to bring her that evening a magnificent pearl\nnecklace with other jewels, and, in advance, half of the yearly pension\nhe had engaged to allow her.  'Leave me only time enough,' said she to\nme, to get possession of these presents; I promise you that he will\nhave little to boast of from his connection with me, for in the country\nI repulsed all his advances, putting him off till our return to town.\nIt is true that he has kissed my hand a thousand times over, and it is\nbut just that he should pay for even this amusement:  I am sure that,\nconsidering his riches as well as his age, five or six thousand francs\nis not an unreasonable price!'\n\n\"Her determination was of more value in my eyes than twenty thousand\ncrowns.  I could feel that I was not yet bereft of every sentiment of\nhonour, by the satisfaction I experienced at escaping thus from infamy.\nBut I was born for brief joys, and miseries of long duration.  Fate\nnever rescued me from one precipice, but to lead me to another.  When I\nhad expressed my delight to Manon at this change in her intentions, I\ntold her she had better inform Lescaut of it, in order that we might\ntake our measures in concert.  At first he murmured, but the money in\nhand induced him to enter into our views.  It was then determined that\nwe should all meet at G---- M----'s supper table, and that, for two\nreasons: first, for the amusement of passing me off as a schoolboy, and\nbrother to Manon; and secondly, to prevent the old profligate from\ntaking any liberties with his mistress, on the strength of his liberal\npayments in advance.  Lescaut and I were to retire, when he went to the\nroom where he expected to pass the night; and Manon, instead of\nfollowing him, promised to come out, and join us.  Lescaut undertook to\nhave a coach waiting at the door.\n\n\"The supper hour having arrived, M. G---- M---- made his appearance.\nAlready Lescaut was with his sister in the supper room.  The moment the\nlover entered, he presented his fair one with a complete set of pearls,\nnecklaces, ear-rings, and bracelets, which must have cost at least a\nthousand crowns.  He then placed on the table before her, in louis\nd'or, two thousand four hundred francs, the half of her year's\nallowance.  He seasoned his present with many pretty speeches in the\ntrue style of the old court.  Manon could not refuse him a few kisses:\nit was sealing her right to the money which he had just handed to her.\nI was at the door, and waiting for Lescaut's signal to enter the room.\n\n\"He approached to take me by the hand, while Manon was securing the\nmoney and jewels, and leading me towards M. G---- M----, he desired me\nto make my bow.  I made two or three most profound ones.  'Pray excuse\nhim, sir,' said Lescaut, 'he is a mere child. He has not yet acquired\nmuch of the ton of Paris; but no doubt with a little trouble we shall\nimprove him.  You will often have the honour of seeing that gentleman,\nhere,' said he, turning towards me: 'take advantage of it, and\nendeavour to imitate so good a model.'\n\n\"The old libertine appeared to be pleased with me.  He patted me on the\ncheek, saying that I was a fine boy, but that I should be on my guard\nin Paris, where young men were easily debauched. Lescaut assured him\nthat I was naturally of so grave a character that I thought of nothing\nbut becoming a clergyman, and that, even as a child, my favourite\namusement was building little chapels.  'I fancy a likeness to Manon,'\nsaid the old gentleman, putting his hand under my chin.  I answered\nhim, with the most simple air-- 'Sir, the fact is, that we are very\nclosely connected, and I love my sister as another portion of myself.'\n'Do you hear that,' said he to Lescaut; 'he is indeed a clever boy!  It\nis a pity he should not see something of the world.' 'Oh, sir,' I\nreplied, 'I have seen a great deal of it at home, attending church, and\nI believe I might find in Paris some greater fools than myself.'\n'Listen,' said he; 'it is positively wonderful in a boy from the\ncountry.'\n\n\"The whole conversation during supper was of the same kind. Manon, with\nher usual gaiety, was several times on the point of spoiling the joke\nby her bursts of laughter.  I contrived, while eating, to recount his\nown identical history, and to paint even the fate that awaited him.\nLescaut and Manon were in an agony of fear during my recital,\nespecially while I was drawing his portrait to the life: but his own\nvanity prevented him from recognising it, and I did it so well that he\nwas the first to pronounce it extremely laughable.  You will allow that\nI had reason for dwelling on this ridiculous scene.\n\n\"At length it was time to retire.  He hinted at the impatience of love.\nLescaut and I took our departure.  G---- M---- went to his room, and\nManon, making some excuse for her absence, came to join us at the gate.\nThe coach, that was waiting for us a few doors off, drove up towards\nus, and we were out of the street in an instant.\n\n\"Although I must confess that this proceeding appeared to me little\nshort of actual robbery, it was not the most dishonest one with which I\nthought I had to reproach myself.  I had more scruples about the money\nwhich I had won at play.  However, we derived as little advantage from\none as from the other; and Heaven sometimes ordains that the lightest\nfault shall meet the severest punishment.\n\n\"M. G---- M---- was not long in finding out that he had been duped.  I\nam not sure whether he took any steps that night to discover us, but he\nhad influence enough to ensure an effectual pursuit, and we were\nsufficiently imprudent to rely upon the extent of Paris and the\ndistance between our residence and his. Not only did he discover our\nabode and our circumstances, but also who I was--the life that I had\nled in Paris--Manon's former connection with B----,--the manner in\nwhich she had deceived him: in a word, all the scandalous facts of our\nhistory.  He therefore resolved to have us apprehended, and treated\nless as criminals than as vagabonds.  An officer came abruptly one\nmorning into our bedroom, with half a dozen archers of the guard.  They\nfirst took possession of our money, or I should rather say, of\nG----M----'s. They made us quickly get up, and conducted us to the\ndoor, where we found two coaches, into one of which they forced poor\nManon, without any explanation, and I was taken in the other to St.\nLazare.\n\n\"One must have experienced this kind of reverse, to understand the\ndespair that is caused by it.  The police were savage enough to deny me\nthe consolation of embracing Manon, or of bidding her farewell.  I\nremained for a long time ignorant of her fate.  It was perhaps\nfortunate for me that I was kept in a state of ignorance, for had I\nknown what she suffered, I should have lost my senses, probably my life.\n\n\"My unhappy mistress was dragged then from my presence, and taken to a\nplace the very name of which fills me with horror to remember.  This to\nbe the lot of a creature the most perfect, who must have shared the\nmost splendid throne on earth, if other men had only seen and felt as I\ndid!  She was not treated harshly there, but was shut up in a narrow\nprison, and obliged, in solitary confinement, to perform a certain\nquantity of work each day, as a necessary condition for obtaining the\nmost unpalatable food.  I did not learn this till a long time after,\nwhen I had myself endured some months of rough and cruel treatment.\n\n\"My guards not having told me where it was that they had been ordered\nto conduct me, it was only on my arrival at St. Lazare that I learned\nmy destination.  I would have preferred death, at that moment, to the\nstate into which I believed myself about to be thrown.  I had the\nutmost terror of this place.  My misery was increased by the guards on\nmy entrance, examining once more my pockets, to ascertain whether I had\nabout me any arms or weapons of defence.\n\n\"The governor appeared.  He had been informed of my apprehension.  He\nsaluted me with great mildness.  'Do not, my good sir,' said I to him,\n'allow me to be treated with indignity. I would suffer a hundred deaths\nrather than quietly submit to degrading treatment.'  'No, no,' he\nreplied, 'you will act quietly and prudently, and we shall be mutually\ncontent with each other.'  He begged of me to ascend to one of the\nhighest rooms; I followed him without a murmur.  The archers\naccompanied us to the door, and the governor, entering the room, made a\nsign for them to depart.  'I am your prisoner, I suppose?' said I;\n'well, what do you intend to do with me?'  He said, he was delighted to\nsee me adopt so reasonable a tone; that it would be his duty to\nendeavour to inspire me with a taste for virtue and religion, and mine\nto profit by his exhortations and advice: that lightly as I might be\ndisposed to rate his attentions to me, I should find nothing but\nenjoyment in my solitude.  'Ah, enjoyment, indeed!' replied I; 'you do\nnot know, my good sir, the only thing on earth that could afford me\nenjoyment.'  'I know it,' said he, 'but I trust your inclinations will\nchange.'  His answer showed that he had heard of my adventures, and\nperhaps of my name.  I begged to know if such were the fact.  He told\nme candidly that they had informed him of every particular.\n\n\"This blow was the severest of any I had yet experienced.  I literally\nshed a torrent of tears, in all the bitterness of unmixed despair; I\ncould not reconcile myself to the humiliation which would make me a\nproverb to all my acquaintances, and the disgrace of my family.  I\npassed a week in the most profound dejection, without being capable of\ngaining any information, or of occupying myself with anything but my\nown degradation.  The remembrance even of Manon added nothing to my\ngrief; it only occurred to me as a circumstance that had preceded my\nnew sorrow; and the sense of shame and confusion was at present the\nall-absorbing passion.\n\n\"There are few persons who have experienced the force of these special\nworkings of the mind.  The generality of men are only sensible of five\nor six passions, in the limited round of which they pass their lives,\nand within which all their agitations are confined.  Remove them from\nthe influence of love and hate, pleasure and pain, hope and fear, and\nthey have no further feeling.  But persons of a finer cast can be\naffected in a thousand different ways; it would almost seem that they\nhad more than five senses, and that they are accessible to ideas and\nsensations which far exceed the ordinary faculties of human nature;\nand, conscious that they possess a capacity which raises them above the\ncommon herd, there is nothing of which they are more jealous.  Hence\nsprings their impatience under contempt and ridicule; and hence it is\nthat a sense of debasement is perhaps the most violent of all their\nemotions.\n\n\"I had this melancholy advantage at St. Lazare.  My grief appeared to\nthe governor so excessive, that, dreading the consequences, he thought\nhe was bound to treat me with more mildness and indulgence.  He visited\nme two or three times a day; he often made me take a turn with him in\nthe garden, and showed his interest for me in his exhortations and good\nadvice.  I listened always attentively; and warmly expressed my sense\nof his kindness, from which he derived hopes of my ultimate conversion.\n\n\"'You appear to me,' said he one day, 'of a disposition so mild and\ntractable, that I cannot comprehend the excesses into which you have\nfallen.  Two things astonish me: one is, how, with your good qualities,\nyou could have ever abandoned yourself to vice; and the other, which\namazes me still more, is, how you can receive with such perfect temper\nmy advice and instructions, after having lived so long in a course of\ndebauchery.  If it be sincere repentance, you present a singular\nexample of the benign mercy of Heaven; if it proceed from the natural\ngoodness of your disposition, then you certainly have that within you\nwhich warrants the hope that a protracted residence in this place will\nnot be required to bring you back to a regular and respectable life.'\n\n\"I was delighted to find that he had such an opinion of me.  I resolved\nto strengthen it by a continuance of good conduct, convinced that it\nwas the surest means of abridging the term of my confinement.  I begged\nof him to furnish me with books.  He was agreeably surprised to find\nthat when he requested me to say what I should prefer, I mentioned only\nsome religious and instructive works.  I pretended to devote myself\nassiduously to study, and I thus gave him convincing proof of the moral\nreformation he was so anxious to bring about.  It was nothing, however,\nbut rank hypocrisy--I blush to confess it.  Instead of studying, when\nalone I did nothing but curse my destiny.  I lavished the bitterest\nexecrations on my prison, and the tyrants who detained me there.  If I\nceased for a moment from these lamentations, it was only to relapse\ninto the tormenting remembrance of my fatal and unhappy love.  Manon's\nabsence--the mystery in which her fate was veiled--the dread of never\nagain beholding her; these formed the subject of my melancholy\nthoughts.  I fancied her in the arms of G---- M----.  Far from\nimagining that he could have been brute enough to subject her to the\nsame treatment to which I was condemned, I felt persuaded that he had\nonly procured my removal, in order that he might possess her in\nundisturbed enjoyment.\n\n\"Oh! how miserable were the days and nights I thus passed!  They seemed\nto be of endless duration.  My only hope of escape now, was in\nhypocrisy; I scrutinised the countenance, and carefully marked every\nobservation that fell from the governor, in order to ascertain what he\nreally thought of me; and looking on him as the sole arbiter of my\nfuture fate, I made it my study to win, if possible, his favour.  I\nsoon had the satisfaction to find that I was firmly established in his\ngood graces, and no longer doubted his disposition to befriend me.\n\n\"I, one day, ventured to ask him whether my liberation depended on him.\nHe replied that it was not altogether in his hands, but that he had no\ndoubt that on his representation M. G---- M----, at whose instance the\nlieutenant-general of police had ordered me to be confined, would\nconsent to my being set at liberty.  'May I flatter myself,' rejoined\nI, in the mildest tone, 'that he will consider two months, which I have\nnow spent in this prison, as a sufficient atonement?'  He offered to\nspeak to him, if I wished it.  I implored him without delay to do me\nthat favour.\n\n\"He told me two days afterwards that G---- M---- was so sensibly\naffected by what he had heard, that he not only was ready to consent to\nmy liberation, but that he had even expressed a strong desire to become\nbetter acquainted with me, and that he himself purposed to pay me a\nvisit in prison.  Although his presence could not afford me much\npleasure, I looked upon it as a certain prelude to my liberation.\n\n\"He accordingly came to St. Lazare.  I met him with an air more grave\nand certainly less silly than I had exhibited at his house with Manon.\nHe spoke reasonably enough of my former bad conduct. He added, as if to\nexcuse his own delinquencies, that it was graciously permitted to the\nweakness of man to indulge in certain pleasures, almost, indeed,\nprompted by nature, but that dishonesty and such shameful practices\nought to be, and always would be, inexorably punished.\n\n\"I listened to all he said with an air of submission, which quite\ncharmed him.  I betrayed no symptoms of annoyance even at some jokes in\nwhich he indulged about my relationship with Manon and Lescaut, and\nabout the little chapels of which he supposed I must have had time to\nerect a great many in St. Lazare, as I was so fond of that occupation.\nBut he happened, unluckily both for me and for himself, to add, that he\nhoped Manon had also employed herself in the same edifying manner at\nthe Magdalen. Notwithstanding the thrill of horror I felt at the sound\nof the name, I had still presence of mind enough to beg, in the\ngentlest manner, that he would explain himself.  'Oh! yes,' he replied,\n'she has been these last two months at the Magdalen learning to be\nprudent, and I trust she has improved herself as much there, as you\nhave done at St. Lazare!'\n\n\"If an eternal imprisonment, or death itself, had been presented to my\nview, I could not have restrained the excitement into which this\nafflicting announcement threw me.  I flung myself upon him in so\nviolent a rage that half my strength was exhausted by the effort.  I\nhad, however, more than enough left to drag him to the ground, and\ngrasp him by the throat.  I should infallibly have strangled him, if\nhis fall, and the half-stifled cries which he had still the power to\nutter, had not attracted the governor and several of the priests to my\nroom.  They rescued him from my fury.\n\n\"I was, myself, breathless and almost impotent from rage.  'Oh God!' I\ncried--'Heavenly justice!  Must I survive this infamy?' I tried again\nto seize the barbarian who had thus roused my indignation--they\nprevented me.  My despair--my cries--my tears, exceeded all belief: I\nraved in so incoherent a manner that all the bystanders, who were\nignorant of the cause, looked at each other with as much dread as\nsurprise.\n\n\"G---- M---- in the meantime adjusted his wig and cravat, and in his\nanger at having been so ill-treated, ordered me to be kept under more\nsevere restraint than before, and to be punished in the manner usual\nwith offenders in St. Lazare.  'No, sir!' said the governor, 'it is not\nwith a person of his birth that we are in the habit of using such means\nof coercion; besides, he is habitually so mild and well-conducted, that\nI cannot but think you must have given provocation for such excessive\nviolence.' This reply disconcerted G---- M---- beyond measure and he\nwent away, declaring that he knew how to be revenged on the governor,\nas well as on me, and everyone else who dared to thwart him.\n\n\"The Superior, having ordered some of the brotherhood to escort him out\nof the prison, remained alone with me.  He conjured me to tell him at\nonce what was the cause of the fracas.--'Oh, my good sir!' said I to\nhim, continuing to cry like a child, 'imagine the most horrible\ncruelty, figure to yourself the most inhuman of atrocities--that is\nwhat G---- M---- has had the cowardly baseness to perpetrate: he has\npierced my heart.  Never shall I recover from this blow!  I would\ngladly tell you the whole circumstance,' added I, sobbing with grief;\n'you are kind-hearted, and cannot fail to pity me.'\n\n\"I gave him, as briefly as I could, a history of my long-standing and\ninsurmountable passion for Manon, of the flourishing condition of our\nfortunes previous to the robbery committed by our servants, of the\noffers which G---- M---- had made to my mistress, of the understanding\nthey had come to, and the manner in which it had been defeated.  To be\nsure, I represented things to him in as favourable a light for us as\npossible.  'Now you can comprehend,' continued I, 'the source of M.\nG---- M----'s holy zeal for my conversion.  He has had influence enough\nto have me shut up here, out of mere revenge. That I can pardon; but,\nmy good sir, that is not all.  He has taken from me my heart's blood:\nhe has had Manon shamefully incarcerated in the Magdalen; and had the\neffrontery to announce it to me this day with his own lips.  In the\nMagdalen, good sir! Oh heavens! my adorable mistress, my beloved Manon,\na degraded inmate of the Hospital!  How shall I command strength of\nmind enough to survive this grief and shame!'\n\n\"The good Father, seeing me in such affliction, endeavoured to console\nme.  He told me that he had never understood my history, as I just now\nrelated it; he had of course known that I led a dissolute life, but he\nhad imagined that M. G---- M----'s interest about me was the result of\nhis esteem and friendship for my family; that it was in this sense he\nhad explained the matter to him; that what I had now told him should\nassuredly produce a change in my treatment, and that he had no doubt\nbut the accurate detail which he should immediately transmit to the\nlieutenant-general of police would bring about my liberation.\n\n\"He then enquired why I had never thought of informing my family of\nwhat had taken place, since they had not been instrumental to my\nincarceration.  I satisfactorily answered this by stating my\nunwillingness to cause my father pain, or to bring upon myself the\nhumiliation of such an exposure.  In the end, he promised to go\ndirectly to the lieutenant-general of police if it were only, said he,\nto be beforehand with M. G---- M----, who went off in such a rage, and\nwho had sufficient influence to make himself formidable.\n\n\"I looked for the good Father's return with all the suspense of a man\nexpecting sentence of death.  It was torture to me to think of Manon at\nthe Magdalen.  Besides the infamy of such a prison, I knew not how she\nmight be treated there; and the recollection of some particulars I had\nformerly heard of this horrible place, incessantly renewed my misery.\nCost what it might, I was so bent upon relieving her by some means or\nother, that I should assuredly have set fire to St. Lazare, if no other\nmode of escape had presented itself.\n\n\"I considered what chances would remain to me if the lieutenant-general\nstill kept me in confinement.  I taxed my ingenuity: I scanned every\nimaginable gleam of hope--I could discover nothing that gave me any\nprospect of escape, and I feared that I should experience only more\nrigid confinement, if I made an unsuccessful attempt.  I thought of\nsome friends from whom I might hope for aid, but then, how was I to\nmake them aware of my situation?  At length I fancied that I had hit\nupon a plan so ingenious, as to offer a fair probability of success.  I\npostponed the details of its arrangement until after the Superior's\nreturn, in case of his having failed in the object of his visit.\n\n\"He soon arrived: I did not observe upon his countenance any of those\nmarks of joy that indicate good news.  'I have spoken,' said he, 'to\nthe lieutenant-general of police, but I was too late, M. G---- M----\nwent straight to him after quitting us, and so prejudiced him against\nyou, that he was on the point of sending me fresh instructions to\nsubject you to closer confinement.\n\n\"'However, when I let him know the truth of your story, he reconsidered\nthe matter, and, smiling at the incontinence of old G---- M----, he\nsaid it would be necessary to keep you here for six months longer, in\norder to pacify him; the less to be lamented,' he added, 'because your\nmorals would be sure to benefit by your residence here.  He desired\nthat I would show you every kindness and attention, and I need not\nassure you that you shall have no reason to complain of your treatment.'\n\n\"This speech of the Superior's was long enough to afford me time to\nform a prudent resolution.  I saw that by betraying too strong an\nimpatience for my liberty, I should probably be upsetting all my\nprojects.  I acknowledged to him, that, as it was necessary to me to\nremain, it was an infinite comfort to know that I possessed a place in\nhis esteem.  I then requested, and with unaffected sincerity, a favour,\nwhich could be of no consequence to others, and which would contribute\nmuch to my peace of mind; it was to inform a friend of mine, a devout\nclergyman, who lived at St. Sulpice, that I was at St. Lazare, and to\npermit me occasionally to receive his visits.\n\n\"This was of course my friend Tiberge; not that I could hope from him\nthe assistance necessary for effecting my liberty; but I wished to make\nhim the unconscious instrument of my designs.  In a word, this was my\nproject: I wished to write to Lescaut, and to charge him and our common\nfriends with the task of my deliverance.  The first difficulty was to\nhave my letter conveyed to him: this should be Tiberge's office.\nHowever, as he knew him to be Manon's brother, I doubted whether he\nwould take charge of this commission.  My plan was to enclose my letter\nto Lescaut in another to some respectable man of my acquaintance,\nbegging of him to transmit the first to its address without delay; and\nas it was necessary that I should have personal communication with\nLescaut, in order to arrange our proceedings, I told him to call on me\nat St. Lazare, and assume the name of my eldest brother, as if he had\ncome to Paris expressly to see me.  I postponed till our meeting all\nmention of the safest and most expeditious course I intended to suggest\nfor our future conduct.  The governor informed Tiberge of my wish to\nsee him.  This ever-faithful friend had not so entirely lost sight of\nme as to be ignorant of my present abode, and it is probable that, in\nhis heart, he did not regret the circumstance, from an idea that it\nmight furnish the means of my moral regeneration.  He lost no time in\npaying me the desired visit.\"\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nIt is a strange thing to note the excess of this passion; and how it\nbraves the nature and value of things, by this--that the speaking in a\nperpetual hyperbole is comely in nothing but in love.--BACON.\n\n\n\"My interview with Tiberge was of the most friendly description. I saw\nthat his object was to discover the present temper of my mind.  I\nopened my heart to him without any reserve, except as to the mere point\nof my intention of escaping.  'It is not from such a friend as you,'\nsaid I, 'that I can ever wish to dissemble my real feelings.  If you\nflattered yourself with a hope that you were at last about to find me\ngrown prudent and regular in my conduct, a libertine reclaimed by the\nchastisements of fortune, released alike from the trammels of love, and\nthe dominion that Manon wields over me, I must in candour say, that you\ndeceive yourself.  You still behold me, as you left me four months ago,\nthe slave--if you will, the unhappy slave--of a passion, from which I\nnow hope, as fervently and as confidently as I ever did, to derive\neventually solid comfort.'\n\n\"He answered, that such an acknowledgment rendered me utterly\ninexcusable; that it was no uncommon case to meet sinners who allowed\nthemselves to be so dazzled with the glare of vice as to prefer it\nopenly to the true splendour of virtue; they were at least deluded by\nthe false image of happiness, the poor dupes of an empty shadow; but to\nknow and feel as I did, that the object of my attachment was only\ncalculated to render me culpable and unhappy, and to continue thus\nvoluntarily in a career of misery and crime, involved a contradiction\nof ideas and of conduct little creditable to my reason.\n\n\"'Tiberge,' replied I, 'it is easy to triumph when your arguments are\nunopposed.  Allow me to reason for a few moments in my turn.  Can you\npretend that what you call the happiness of virtue is exempt from\ntroubles, and crosses, and cares?  By what name will you designate the\ndungeon, the rack, the inflections and tortures of tyrants?  Will you\nsay with the Mystics[1] that the soul derives pleasure from the\ntorments of the body?  You are not bold enough to hold such a\ndoctrine--a paradox not to be maintained.  This happiness, then, that\nyou prize so much, has a thousand drawbacks, or is, more properly\nspeaking, but a tissue of sufferings through which one hopes to attain\nfelicity.  If by the power of imagination one can even derive pleasure\nfrom these sufferings, hoping that they may lead to a happy end, why,\nlet me ask, do you deem my conduct senseless, when it is directed by\nprecisely the same principle?  I love Manon: I wade through sorrow and\nsuffering in order to attain happiness with her.  My path is one indeed\nof difficulties, but the mere hope of reaching the desired goal makes\nit easy and delightful; and I shall think myself but too bountifully\nrepaid by one moment of her society, for all the troubles I encounter\nin my course.  There appears therefore no difference between us, or, if\nthere be any, it is assuredly in my favour; for the bliss I hope for is\nnear and tangible, yours is far distant, and purely speculative.  Mine\nis of the same kind as my sufferings, that is to say, evident to my\nsenses; yours is of an incomprehensible nature, and only discernible\nthrough the dim medium of faith.'\n\n\"Tiberge appeared shocked by my remarks.  He retired two or three paces\nfrom me, while he said, in the most serious tone, that my argument was\nnot only a violation of good sense, but that it was the miserable\nsophistry of irreligion; 'for the comparison,' he added, 'of the\npitiful reward of your sufferings with that held out to us by the\ndivine revelation, is the essence of impiety and absurdity combined.'\n\n\"'I acknowledge,' said I, 'that the comparison is not a just one, but\nmy argument does not at all depend upon it.  I was about to explain\nwhat you consider a contradiction--the persevering in a painful\npursuit; and I think I have satisfactorily proved, that if there be any\ncontradiction in that, we shall be both equally obnoxious to the\ncharge.  It was in this light, only, that I could observe no difference\nin our cases, and I cannot as yet perceive any.\n\n\"'You may probably answer, that the proposed end, the promised reward,\nof virtue, is infinitely superior to that of love?  No one disputes it,\nbut that is not the question--we are only discussing the relative aid\nthey both afford in the endurance of affliction.  Judge of that by the\npractical effect: are there not multitudes who abandon a life of strict\nvirtue? how few give up the pursuits of love!\n\n\"'Again, you will reply that if there be difficulties in the exercise\nof virtue, they are by no means universal and sure; that the good man\ndoes not necessarily meet tyrants and tortures, and that, on the\ncontrary, a life of virtue is perfectly compatible with repose and\nenjoyment.  I can say with equal truth, that love is often accompanied\nby content and happiness; and what makes another distinction of\ninfinite advantage to my argument, I may add that love, though it often\ndeludes, never holds out other than hopes of bliss and joy, whilst\nreligion exacts from her votaries mortification and sorrow.\n\n\"'Do not be alarmed,' said I, perceiving that I had almost offended his\nzealous feelings of devotion.  'I only wish to say, that there is no\nmore unsuccessful method of weaning man's heart from love, than by\nendeavouring to decry its enjoyments, and by promising him more\npleasure from the exercise of virtue.  It is an inherent principle in\nour nature, that our felicity consists only in pleasure.  I defy you to\nconceive any other notion of it; and it requires little time to arrive\nat the conviction, that, of all pleasures, those of love are\nimmeasurably the most enchanting.  A man quickly discerns the delusion,\nwhen he hears the promise made of livelier enjoyment, and the effect of\nsuch misrepresentation is only to make him doubt the truth of a more\nsolid promise.\n\n\"'Let the preacher who seeks the reformation of a sinner tell me that\nvirtue is indispensably necessary, but not disguise its difficulty and\nits attendant denials.  Say that the enjoyments of love are fleeting,\nif you will, that they are rigidly forbidden, that they lead with\ncertainty to eternal suffering; and, what would assuredly make a deeper\nimpression upon me than any other argument, say that the more sweet and\ndelectable they are, the brighter will be the reward of Heaven for\ngiving them up in sacrifice; but do in the name of justice admit, that,\nconstituted as the heart of man is, they form here, on earth, our most\nperfect happiness.'\n\n\"My last sentence restored to Tiberge his good humour.  He allowed that\nmy ideas were not altogether so unreasonable.  The only point he made,\nwas in asking me why I did not carry my own principle into operation,\nby sacrificing my passion to the hope of that remuneration of which I\nhad drawn so brilliant a picture. 'Oh! my dear friend,' replied I;\n'that it is which makes me conscious of my own misery and weakness:\ntrue, alas! it is indeed my duty to act according to my argument; but\nhave I the power of governing my own actions?  What aid will enable me\nto forget Manon's charms?'  'God forgive me,' said Tiberge, 'I can\nalmost fancy you a Jansenist[2].  'I know not of what sect I am,'\nreplied I, 'nor do I indeed very clearly see to which I ought to\nbelong; but I cannot help feeling the truth of this at least of their\ntenets.'\n\n\"One effect of our conversation was to revive my friend's pity for me\nin all its force.  He perceived that there was in my errors more of\nweakness than of vice; and he was the more disposed in the end to give\nme assistance; without which I should infallibly have perished from\ndistress of mind.  However, I carefully concealed from him my intention\nof escaping from St. Lazare.  I merely begged of him to take charge of\nmy letter; I had it ready before he came, and I soon found an excuse\nfor the necessity of writing.  He faithfully transmitted it, and\nLescaut received before evening the one I had enclosed for him.\n\n\"He came to see me next morning, and fortunately was admitted under my\nbrother's name.  I was overjoyed at finding him in my room.  I\ncarefully closed the door.  'Let us lose no time,' I said.  'First tell\nme about Manon, and then advise me how I am to shake off these\nfetters.'  He assured me that he had not seen his sister since the day\nbefore my arrest, and that it was only by repeated enquiries, and after\nmuch trouble, that he had at length been able to discover her fate as\nwell as mine; and that he had two or three times presented himself at\nthe Magdalen, and been refused admittance.  'Wretch!' muttered I to\nmyself, 'dearly shall G---- M---- pay for this!'\n\n\"'As to your escape,' continued Lescaut, 'it will not be so easy as you\nimagine.  Last evening, I and a couple of friends walked round this\nestablishment to reconnoitre it; and we agreed that, as your windows\nlooked into a court surrounded by buildings, as you yourself mentioned\nin your letter, there would be vast difficulty in getting you out.\nBesides, you are on the third story, and it would be impossible to\nintroduce ropes or ladders through the window.  I therefore see no\nmeans from without--in the house itself we must hit upon some scheme.'\n\n\"'No,' replied I; 'I have examined everything minutely, particularly\nsince, through the governor's indulgence, my confinement has been less\nrigorous.  I am no longer locked into my room; I have liberty to walk\nin the gallery; but there is, upon every landing, a strong door kept\nclosed night and day, so that it is impossible that ingenuity alone,\nunaided by some violent efforts, can rescue me.\n\n\"'Wait,' said I, after turning in my mind for a moment an idea that\nstruck me as excellent; 'could you bring me a pistol?' 'Softly,' said\nLescaut to me, 'you don't think of committing murder?'  I assured him\nthat I had so little intention of shooting anyone, that it would not be\neven necessary to have the pistol loaded.  'Bring it to me tomorrow,' I\nadded, 'and do not fail to be exactly opposite the great entrance with\ntwo or three of your friends at eleven tomorrow night; I think I shall\nbe able to join you there.'  He in vain requested me to explain my\nplan. I told him that such an attempt as I contemplated could only\nappear rational after it had succeeded.  I begged of him to shorten his\nvisit, in order that he might with the less difficulty be admitted next\nmorning.  He was accordingly admitted as readily as on his first visit.\nHe had put on so serious an air, moreover, that a stranger would have\ntaken him for a respectable person.\n\n\"When I found in my hand the instrument of my liberty, I no longer\ndoubted my success.  It was certainly a strange and a bold project; but\nof what was I not capable, with the motives that inspired me?  I had,\nsince I was allowed permission to walk in the galleries, found\nopportunities of observing that every night the porter brought the keys\nof all the doors to the governor, and subsequently there always reigned\na profound silence in the house, which showed that the inmates had\nretired to rest.  There was an open communication between my room and\nthat of the Superior.  My resolution was, if he refused quietly to\nsurrender the keys, to force him, by fear of the pistol, to deliver\nthem up, and then by their help to gain the street.  I impatiently\nawaited the moment for executing my purpose.  The porter arrived at his\nusual time, that is to say, soon after nine o'clock.  I allowed an hour\nto elapse, in order that the priests as well as the servants might be\nall asleep.  I at length proceeded with my pistol and a lighted candle.\nI first gave a gentle tap at the governor's door to awaken without\nalarming him.  I knocked a second time before he heard me; and\nsupposing of course that it was one of the priests who was taken ill\nand wanted assistance, he got out of bed, dressed himself, and came to\nthe door.  He had, however, the precaution to ask first who it was, and\nwhat was wanted?  I was obliged to mention my name, but I assumed a\nplaintive tone, to make him believe that I was indisposed.  'Ah! it is\nyou, my dear boy,' said he on opening the door; 'what can bring you\nhere at this hour?'  I stepped inside the door, and leading him to the\nopposite side of the room, I declared to him that it was absolutely\nimpossible for me to remain longer at St. Lazare; that the night was\nthe most favourable time for going out unobserved, and that I\nconfidently expected, from his tried friendship, that he would consent\nto open the gates for me, or entrust me with the keys to let myself out.\n\n\"This compliment to his friendship seemed to surprise him.  He stood\nfor a few moments looking at me without making any reply. Finding that\nI had no time to lose, I just begged to assure him that I had the most\nlively sense of all his kindnesses, but that freedom was dearer to man\nthan every other consideration, especially so to me, who had been\ncruelly and unjustly deprived of it; that I was resolved this night to\nrecover it, cost what it would, and fearing lest he might raise his\nvoice and call for assistance, I let him see the powerful incentive to\nsilence which I had kept concealed in my bosom.  'A pistol!' cried he.\n'What! my son? will you take away my life in return for the attentions\nI have shown you?'  'God forbid,' replied I; 'you are too reasonable to\ndrive me to that horrible extremity: but I am determined to be free,\nand so firmly determined, that if you defeat my project, I will put an\nend to your existence.'  'But, my dear son!' said he, pale and\nfrightened, 'what have I done to you?  What reason have you for taking\nmy life?'  'No!' replied I, impatiently, 'I have no design upon your\nlife, if you, yourself, wish to live; open but the doors for me, and\nyou will find me the most attached of friends.'  I perceived the keys\nupon the table. I requested he would take them in his hand and walk\nbefore me, making as little noise as he possibly could.\n\n\"He saw the necessity of consenting.  We proceeded, and as he opened\neach door, he repeated, always with a sigh, 'Ah! my son, who could have\nbelieved it?'  'No noise, good Father, no noise,' I as often answered\nin my turn.  At length we reached a kind of barrier, just inside the\ngreat entrance.  I already fancied myself free, and kept close behind\nthe governor, with my candle in one hand, and my pistol in the other.\n\n\"While he was endeavouring to open the heavy gate, one of the servants,\nwho slept in an adjoining room, hearing the noise of the bolts, jumped\nout of bed, and peeped forth to see what was passing.  The good Father\napparently thought him strong enough to overpower me.  He commanded\nhim, most imprudently, to come to his assistance.  He was a powerful\nruffian, and threw himself upon me without an instant's hesitation.\nThere was no time for parleying--I levelled my pistol and lodged the\ncontents in his breast!  'See, Father, of what mischief you have been\nthe cause,' said I to my guide; 'but that must not prevent us from\nfinishing our work,' I added, pushing him on towards the last door.  He\ndid not dare refuse to open it.  I made my exit in perfect safety, and,\na few paces off, found Lescaut with two friends waiting for me,\naccording to his promise.\n\n\"We removed at once to a distance.  Lescaut enquired whether he had not\nheard the report of a pistol?  'You are to blame,' said I, 'why did you\nbring it charged?'  I, however, could not help thanking him for having\ntaken this precaution, without which I doubtless must have continued\nmuch longer at St. Lazare.  We went to pass the night at a tavern,\nwhere I made up, in some degree, for the miserable fare which had been\ndoled out to me for nearly three months.  I was very far, however, from\ntasting perfect enjoyment; Manon's sufferings were mine.  'She must be\nreleased,' said I to my companions: 'this was my sole object in\ndesiring my own liberty.  I rely on your aiding me with all your\ningenuity; as for myself, my life shall be devoted to the purpose.'\n\n\"Lescaut, who was not deficient in tact, and still less in that better\npart of valour called discretion, dwelt upon the necessity of acting\nwith extreme caution: he said that my escape from St. Lazare, and the\naccident that happened on my leaving it, would assuredly create a\nsensation; that the lieutenant-general of police would cause a strict\nsearch to be made for me, and it would be difficult to evade him; in\nfine, that, unless disposed to encounter something worse, perhaps, than\nSt. Lazare, it would be requisite for me to remain concealed for a few\ndays, in order to give the enemy's zeal time to cool.  No doubt this\nwas wise counsel; but, one should have been wise oneself to have\nfollowed it.  Such calculating slowness little suited my passion.  The\nutmost I could bring myself to promise was, that I would sleep through\nthe whole of the next day.  He locked me in my bedroom, where I\nremained patiently until night.\n\n\"I employed great part of the time in devising schemes for relieving\nManon.  I felt persuaded that her prison was even more inaccessible\nthan mine had been.  Force was out of the question. Artifice was the\nonly resource; but the goddess of invention herself could not have told\nme how to begin.  I felt the impossibility of working in the dark, and\ntherefore postponed the further consideration of my schemes until I\ncould acquire some knowledge of the internal arrangements of the\nHospital, in which she was confined.\n\n\"As soon as night restored to me my liberty, I begged of Lescaut to\naccompany me.  We were not long in drawing one of the porters into\nconversation; he appeared a reasonable man.  I passed for a stranger\nwho had often with admiration heard talk of the Hospital, and of the\norder that reigned within it.  I enquired into the most minute details;\nand, proceeding from one subject to another, we at length spoke of the\nmanagers, and of these I begged to know the names and the respective\ncharacters.  He gave me such information upon the latter point as at\nonce suggested an idea which flattered my hopes, and I immediately set\nabout carrying it into execution.\n\n\"I asked him (this being a matter essential to my plan) whether any of\nthe gentlemen had children.  He said he could not answer me with\ncertainty as to all, but as for M. de T----, one of the principal\ndirectors, he knew that he had a son old enough to be married, and who\nhad come several times to the Hospital with his father.  This was\nenough for my purpose.\n\n\"I immediately put an end to our interview, and, in returning, I told\nLescaut of the plan I had formed.  'I have taken it,' said I, 'into my\nhead, that M. de T----, the son, who is rich and of good family, must\nhave the same taste for pleasure that other young men of his age\ngenerally have.  He could hardly be so bad a friend to the fair sex,\nnor so absurd as to refuse his services in an affair of love.  I have\narranged a plan for interesting him in favour of Manon.  If he is a man\nof feeling and of right mind, he will give us his assistance from\ngenerosity.  If he is not to be touched by a motive of this kind, he\nwill at least do something for a handsome girl, if it were only with\nthe hope of hereafter sharing her favours.  I will not defer seeing\nhim,' added I, 'beyond tomorrow.  I really feel so elated by this\nproject, that I derive from it a good omen.'\n\n\"Lescaut himself allowed that the idea was not unreasonable, and that\nwe might fairly entertain a hope of turning it to account. I passed the\nnight less sorrowfully.\n\n\"Next morning I dressed as well as, in my present state of indigence, I\ncould possibly contrive to do; and went in a hackney coach to the\nresidence of M. de T----.  He was surprised at receiving a visit from a\nperfect stranger.  I augured favourably from his countenance and the\ncivility of his manner.  I explained my object in the most candid way;\nand, to excite his feelings as much as possible, I spoke of my ardent\npassion and of Manon's merit, as of two things that were unequalled,\nexcept by each other.  He told me, that although he had never seen\nManon, he had heard of her; at least, if the person I was talking of\nwas the same who had been the mistress of old G---- M----.  I\nconjectured that he must have heard of the part I had acted in that\ntransaction, and in order to conciliate him more and more by treating\nhim with confidence, I told him everything that had occurred to Manon\nand myself.  'You see, sir,' said I, 'that all that can interest me in\nlife, all that can command my affections, is in your hands.  I have no\nreserve with you, because I have been informed of your generous and\nnoble character; and, being of the same age, I trust I shall find some\nresemblance in our dispositions.'\n\n\"He seemed flattered by this mark of candour and confidence.  He\nreplied in a manner that became a man of the world, and a man of\nfeeling also, for they are not always synonymous terms.  He told me\nthat he appreciated my visit as a piece of good fortune; that he\nconsidered my friendship as a valuable acquisition, and that he would\nendeavour to prove himself worthy of it, by the sincerity of his\nservices.  He could not absolutely promise to restore Manon to my arms,\nbecause, as he said, he himself had very little influence; but he\noffered to procure me the pleasure of seeing her, and to do everything\nin his power to effect her release.  I was the more satisfied with this\nfrank avowal as to his want of influence, than I should have been by an\nunqualified promise of fulfilling all my wishes.  I found in his\nmoderation a pledge of his sincerity: in a word, I no longer doubted my\nentire success.  The promise alone of enabling me to see Manon filled\nme with gratitude, and I testified it in so earnest a manner, as to\ngive him a favourable opinion of my heart and disposition; we shook\nhands warmly, and parted sworn friends, merely from mutual regard, and\nthat natural feeling which prompts a man of kind and generous\nsentiments to esteem another of congenial mind.\n\n\"He, indeed, exceeded me in the proofs of his esteem; for, inferring\nfrom my adventures, and especially my late escape from St. Lazare, that\nI might be in want of money, he offered me his purse, and pressed me to\naccept it.  I refused, but said to him, 'You are too kind, my dear sir!\nIf in addition to such proofs of kindness and friendship, you enable me\nto see Manon again, rely on my eternal regard and gratitude.  If you\nsucceed in restoring altogether this dear creature to my arms, I should\nthink myself happy in spilling the last drop of my blood in your\nservice.'\n\n\"Before we parted, we agreed as to the time and place for our meeting.\nHe was so considerate as to appoint the afternoon of the same day.\n\n\"I waited for him at a cafe, where he joined me about four o'clock, and\nwe went together towards the Magdalen; my knees trembled under me as I\ncrossed the courts.  'Ye heavenly powers!' said I, 'then I shall once\nmore behold the idol of my heart--the dear object of so many sighs and\nlamentations!  All I now ask of Providence is, to vouchsafe me strength\nenough to reach her presence, and after that, to dispose as it pleaseth\nof my future fate, and of my life itself.  Beyond this, I have no\nprayer to utter.'\n\n\"M. de T---- spoke to some of the porters of the establishment, who\nappeared all anxious to please him.  The quarter in which Manon's room\nlay was pointed out to us, and our guide carried in his hand the key of\nher chamber: it was of frightful size.  I asked the man who conducted\nus, and whose duty it was to attend to Manon, how she passed her time?\nHe said, that she had a temper of the most angelic sweetness; that even\nhe, disagreeable as his official duties must render him, had never\nheard from her a single syllable in the nature of rebuke or harshness;\nthat her tears had never ceased to flow during the first six weeks\nafter her arrival, but that latterly she seemed to bear her misfortunes\nwith more resignation, and that she employed herself from morning till\nnight with her needle, excepting some hours that she, each day, devoted\nto reading.  I asked whether she had been decently provided for.  He\nassured me that at least she had never felt the want of necessaries.\n\n\"We now approached her door.  My heart beat almost audibly in my bosom.\nI said to M. de T----, 'Go in alone, and prepare her for my visit; I\nfear that she may be overcome by seeing me unexpectedly.'  The door was\nopened.  I remained in the passage, and listened to the conversation.\nHe said that he came to bring her consolation; that he was a friend of\nmine, and felt deeply interested for the happiness of us both.  She\nasked with the tenderest anxiety, whether he could tell her what had\nbecome of me.  He promised that she should soon see me at her feet, as\naffectionate and as faithful as ever.  'When?' she asked. 'This very\nday,' said he; 'the happy moment shall not be long delayed; nay, this\nvery instant even, if you wish it.'  She at once understood that I was\nat the door; as she was rushing towards it, I entered.  We embraced\neach other with that abounding and impassioned tenderness, which an\nabsence of many months makes so delicious to those who truly love.  Our\nsighs, our broken exclamations, the thousand endearing appellations of\nlove, exchanged in languishing rapture, astonished M. de T----, and\naffected him even to tears.\n\n\"'I cannot help envying you,' said he, as he begged us to be seated;\n'there is no lot, however glorious, that I would hold as comparable to\nthe possession of a mistress at once so tender and impassioned.'  'Nor\nwould I,' I replied, 'give up her love for universal empire!'\n\n\"The remainder of an interview which had been so long and so ardently\ndesired by me, was of course as tender as the commencement.  Poor Manon\nrelated all her adventures, and I told her mine: we bitterly wept over\neach other's story.  M. de T---- consoled us by his renewed promises to\nexert himself in our service.  He advised us not to make this, our\nfirst interview, of too long duration, that he might have the less\ndifficulty in procuring us the same enjoyment again.  He at length\ninduced us to follow his advice.  Manon especially could not reconcile\nherself to the separation: she made me a hundred times resume my seat.\nAt one time she held me by my hands, at another by my coat.  'Alas!'\nshe said, 'in what an abode do you leave me!  Who will answer for my\never seeing you again?'  M. de T---- promised her that he would often\ncome and see her with me.  'As to the abode,' he said, 'it must no\nlonger be called the Magdalen; it is Versailles! now that it contains a\nperson who deserves the empire of all hearts.'\n\n\"I made the man who attended a present as I went out, in order to\nquicken his zeal and attentions.  This fellow had a mind less rough and\nvulgar than the generality of his class.  He had witnessed our\ninterview, and was affected by it.  The interest he felt was doubtless\nincreased by the louis d'or I gave him.  He took me aside as we went\ndown into the courtyard.  'Sir,' said he, 'if you will only take me\ninto your service, or indemnify me in any way for the loss of the\nsituation which I fill here, I think I should not have much difficulty\nin liberating the beauteous Manon.'\n\n\"I caught readily at the suggestion, and, although at the moment I was\nalmost in a state of destitution, I gave him promises far beyond his\ndesires.  I considered that it would be at all times easy to recompense\na man of his description.  'Be assured, my friend,' said I to him,\n'that there is nothing I will not be ready to do for you, and that your\nfortune is just as certain as my own.'  I enquired what means he\nintended to employ.  'None other,' said he, 'than merely to open the\ndoor of her cell for her at night, and to conduct her to the street\ndoor, where you, of course, will be to receive her.'  I asked whether\nthere was no danger of her being recognised as she traversed the long\ngalleries and the courts.  He admitted that there was danger, but that\nnothing could be done without some slight risk.\n\n\"Although I was delighted to find him so determined, I called M. de\nT----, and informed him of the project, and of the only difficulty in\nthe way.  He thought it not so easy of execution. He allowed the\npossibility of escaping thus:  'But if she be recognised,' continued\nhe, 'if she be stopped in the attempt, all hope will be over with her,\nperhaps for ever.  Besides, you would be obliged to quit Paris\ninstantly, for you could never evade the search that would be made for\nyou: they would redouble their efforts as much on your own account as\nhers.  A single man may easily escape detection, but in company with a\nhandsome woman, it would be utterly impossible to remain undiscovered.'\n\n\"However sound this reasoning, it could not, in my mind, outweigh the\nimmediate prospect of restoring Manon to liberty.  I said as much to M.\nde T----, and trusted that he would excuse my imprudence and rashness,\non the ground of love.  I added that it was already my intention to\nquit Paris for some neighbouring village, as I had once before done.\nWe then settled with the servant that he should carry his project into\nexecution the following day, and to render our success as certain as he\ncould, we resolved to carry into the prison men's clothes, in order to\nfacilitate her escape.\"\n\n\"There was a difficulty to be surmounted in carrying them in, but I had\ningenuity enough to meet it.  I begged of M. de T---- only to put on\ntwo light waistcoats the next morning, and I undertook to arrange the\nrest.\n\n\"We returned the following day to the Hospital.  I took with me linen,\nstockings, etc., for Manon, and over my body-coat a surtout, which\nconcealed the bulk I carried in my pockets.  We remained but a moment\nin her room.  M. de T---- left her one of his waistcoats; I gave her my\nshort coat, the surtout being sufficient for me.  She found nothing\nwanting for her complete equipment but a pair of pantaloons, which in\nmy hurry I had forgotten.\n\n\"The want of so necessary an article might have amused us, if the\nembarrassment it caused had been of a less serious kind.  I was in\ndespair at having our whole scheme foiled by a trifling omission of\nthis nature.  However, I soon hit on a remedy, and determined to make\nmy own exit sans-culotte, leaving that portion of my dress with Manon.\nMy surtout was long, and I contrived by the help of a few pins to put\nmyself in a decent condition for passing the gate.\n\n\"The remainder of the day appeared to me of endless length. When at\nlast night came, we went in a coach to within a few yards of the\nHospital.  We were not long waiting, when we saw Manon make her\nappearance with her guide.  The door of the coach being opened, they\nboth stepped in without delay.  I opened my arms to receive my adored\nmistress; she trembled like an aspen leaf.  The coachman asked where he\nwas to drive?  'To the end of the world!' I exclaimed; 'to some place\nwhere I can never again be separated from Manon.'\n\n\"This burst, which I could not control, was near bringing me into fresh\ntrouble.  The coachman reflected upon what I said, and when I\nafterwards told him the name of the street to which I wished him to\ndrive, he answered that he feared I was about to implicate him in some\nbad business; that he saw plainly enough that the good-looking young\nman whom I called Manon was a girl eloping from the Hospital, and that\nhe was little disposed indeed to ruin himself for love of me.\n\n\"Extortion was the source of this scoundrel's delicacy.  We were still\ntoo near the Hospital to make any noise.  'Silence!' said I to him,\n'you shall have a louis d'or for the job': for less than that he would\nhave helped me to burn the Hospital.\n\n\"We arrived at Lescaut's house.  As it was late, M. de T---- left us on\nthe way, promising to visit us the next morning.  The servant alone\nremained.\n\n\"I held Manon in such close embrace in my arms, that we occupied but\none place in the coach.  She cried for joy, and I could feel her tears\ntrickling down my cheeks.\n\n\"When we were about getting out at Lescaut's, I had a new difficulty\nwith the coachman, which was attended with the most unfortunate\nresults.  I repented of having promised the fellow a louis d'or, not\nonly because it was extravagant folly, but for another stronger reason,\nthat it was at the moment out of my power to pay him.  I called for\nLescaut, and he came down to the door.  I whispered to him the cause of\nmy present embarrassment. Being naturally rough, and not at all in the\nhabit of treating hackney-coachmen with respect, he answered that I\ncould not be serious.  'A louis!' said he; 'twenty blows of a cane\nwould be the right payment for that rascal!'  I entreated him not to\ndestroy us; when he snatched my cane from my hand, and was about to lay\nit on the coachman.  The fellow had probably before experienced the\nweight of a guardsman's arm, and instantly drove off, crying out, that\nI had cheated him, and should hear of him again.  I in vain endeavoured\nto stop him.\n\n\"His flight caused me, of course, the greatest alarm.  I had no doubt\nthat he would immediately give information to the police. 'You have\nruined me,' said I to Lescaut; 'I shall be no longer safe at your\nhouse; we must go hence at once.'  I gave Manon my arm, and as quickly\nas possible got out of the dangerous neighbourhood.  Lescaut\naccompanied us.\"\n\nThe Chevalier des Grieux having occupied more than an hour with his\nstory, I begged him to give himself a little rest, and meanwhile to\nshare our supper.  He saw, by the attention we paid him, that we were\namused, and promised that we should hear something of perhaps greater\ninterest in the sequel.  When we had finished supper, he continued in\nthe following words.\n\n\n[1] A favourite tenet of the Mystics, advocated by Madame de Guyon, and\nadopted by the amiable and eloquent Fenelon, was, that the love of the\nSupreme Being must be pure and disinterested; that is, exempt from all\nviews of interest, and all hope of reward.  See the controversy between\nBossuet and Fenelon.\n\n[2] The first proposition of the Jansenists was, that there are divine\nprecepts which good men, notwithstanding their desire to observe them,\nare nevertheless absolutely unable to obey: God not having given them\nsuch a measure of grace as is essentially necessary to render them\ncapable of obedience.--Mosheim's Eccles. Hist., ii. 397.\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\n  . . . How chances mock,\n  And changes fill the cup of alteration\n  With divers liquors.\n        SHAKESPEARE.\n\n\n\"How inscrutably does Providence connect events!  We had hardly\nproceeded for five minutes on our way, when a man, whose face I could\nnot see, recognised Lescaut.  He had no doubt been watching for him\nnear his home, with the horrible intention which he now unhappily\nexecuted.  'It IS Lescaut!' said he, snapping a pistol at his head; 'he\nshall sup tonight with the angels!'  He then instantly disappeared.\nLescaut fell, without the least sign of life.  I pressed Manon to fly,\nfor we could be of no use to a dead man, and I feared being arrested by\nthe police, who would certainly be soon upon the spot.  I turned down\nthe first narrow street with her and the servant: she was so\noverpowered by the scene she had just witnessed, that I could hardly\nsupport her. At last, at the end of the street, I perceived a\nhackney-coach; we got into it, but when the coachman asked whither he\nshould drive, I was scarcely able to answer him.  I had no certain\nasylum--no confidential friend to whom I could have recourse.  I was\nalmost destitute of money, having but one dollar left in my purse.\nFright and fatigue had so unnerved Manon, that she was almost fainting\nat my side.  My imagination too was full of the murder of Lescaut, and\nI was not without strong apprehensions of the patrol.  What was to be\ndone?  I luckily remembered the inn at Chaillot, where we first went to\nreside in that village.  I hoped to be not only secure, but to continue\nthere for some time without being pressed for payment.  'Take us to\nChaillot,' said I to the coachman.  He refused to drive us so far at\nthat late hour for less than twelve francs.  A new embarrassment!  At\nlast we agreed for half that sum--all that my purse contained.\n\n\"I tried to console Manon as we went along, but despair was rankling in\nmy own heart.  I should have destroyed myself a thousand times over, if\nI had not felt that I held in my arms all that could attach me to life:\nthis reflection reconciled me.  'I possess her at least,' said I; 'she\nloves me! she is mine! Vainly does Tiberge call this a mere phantom of\nhappiness.'  I could, without feeling interest or emotion, see the\nwhole world besides perish around me.  Why?  Because I have in it no\nobject of affection beyond her.\n\n\"This sentiment was true; however, while I so lightly esteemed the good\nthings of the world, I felt that there was no doing without some little\nportion of them, were it only to inspire a more thorough contempt for\nthe remainder.  Love is more powerful than wealth--more attractive than\ngrandeur or fame; but, alas! it cannot exist without certain artificial\naids; and there is nothing more humiliating to the feelings, of a\nsensitive lover, than to find himself, by want of means, reduced to the\nlevel of the most vulgar minds.\n\n\"It was eleven o'clock when we arrived at Chaillot.  They received us\nat the inn as old acquaintances, and expressed no sort of surprise at\nseeing Manon in male attire, for it was the custom in Paris and the\nenvirons to adopt all disguises.  I took care to have her served with\nas much attention as if I had been in prosperous circumstances.  She\nwas ignorant of my poverty, and I carefully kept her so, being resolved\nto return alone the following day to Paris, to seek some cure for this\nvexatious kind of malady.\n\n\"At supper she appeared pale and thin; I had not observed this at the\nHospital, as the room in which I saw her was badly lighted.  I asked\nher if the excessive paleness were not caused by the shock of\nwitnessing her brother's death?  She assured me that, horrified as she\nnaturally was at the event, her paleness was purely the effect of a\nthree months' absence from me.  'You do love me then devotedly?' I\nexclaimed.\n\n\"'A thousand times more than I can tell!' was her reply.\n\n\"'You will never leave me again?' I added.\n\n\"'No! never, never!' answered she.\n\n\"This assurance was confirmed by so many caresses and vows, that it\nappeared impossible she could, to the end of time, forget them.  I have\nnever doubted that she was at that moment sincere. What motive could\nshe have had for dissembling to such a degree? But she became\nafterwards still more volatile than ever, or rather she was no longer\nanything, and entirely forgot herself, when, in poverty and want, she\nsaw other women living in abundance.  I was now on the point of\nreceiving a new proof of her inconstancy, which threw all that had\npassed into the shade, and which led to the strangest adventure that\never happened to a man of my birth and prospects.\n\n\"As I knew her disposition, I hastened the next day to Paris. The death\nof her brother, and the necessity of getting linen and clothes for her,\nwere such good reasons, that I had no occasion for any further pretext.\nI left the inn, with the intention, as I told Manon and the landlord,\nof going in a hired carriage, but this was a mere flourish; necessity\nobliged me to travel on foot: I walked very fast as far as\nCours-la-Reine, where I intended to rest.  A moment of solitude and\ntranquillity was requisite to compose myself, and to consider what was\nto be done in Paris.\n\n\"I sat down upon the grass.  I plunged into a sea of thoughts and\nconsiderations, which at length resolved themselves into three\nprincipal heads.  I had pressing want of an infinite number of absolute\nnecessaries; I had to seek some mode of at least raising a hope for the\nfuture; and, though last, not least in importance, I had to gain\ninformation, and adopt measures, to secure Manon's safety and my own.\nAfter having exhausted myself in devising projects upon these three\nchief points, I was obliged to put out of view for the moment the two\nlast.  We were not ill sheltered from observation in the inn at\nChaillot; and as to future wants, I thought it would be time enough to\nthink about them when those of the moment were satisfied.\n\n\"The main object now was to replenish my purse.  M. de T---- had once\noffered me his, but I had an extreme repugnance to mention the subject\nto him again.  What a degradation to expose one's misery to a stranger,\nand to ask for charity: it must be either a man of low mind who would\nthus demean himself, and that from a baseness which must render him\ninsensible to the degradation, or a humble Christian, from a\nconsciousness of generosity in himself, which must put him above the\nsense of shame.  I would have sacrificed half my life to be spared the\nhumiliation.\n\n\"'Tiberge,' said I, 'kind Tiberge, will he refuse me what he has it in\nhis power to grant?  No, he will assuredly sympathise in my misery; but\nhe will also torture me with his lectures!  One must endure his\nreproaches, his exhortations, his threats: I shall have to purchase his\nassistance so dearly, that I would rather make any sacrifice than\nencounter this distressing scene, which cannot fail to leave me full of\nsorrow and remorse.  Well,' thought I again, 'all hope must be\nrelinquished, since no other course presents itself: so far am I from\nadopting either of these, that I would sooner shed half my blood than\nface one of these evils, or the last drop rather than encounter both.\nYes, the very last drop,' I repeated after a moment's reflection, 'I\nwould sacrifice willingly rather than submit to such base supplication!\n\n\"'But it is not in reality a question of my existence!  Manon's life\nand maintenance, her love and her fidelity, are at stake! What\nconsideration can outweigh that?  In her are centred all my glory,\nhappiness, and future fortune!  There are doubtless many things that I\nwould gladly give up my life to obtain, or to avoid; but to estimate a\nthing merely beyond the value of my own life, is not putting it on a\npar with that of Manon.'  This idea soon decided me: I went on my way,\nresolved to go first to Tiberge, and afterwards to M. de T----.\n\n\"On entering Paris I took a hackney-coach, though I had not wherewithal\nto pay for it; I calculated on the loan I was going to solicit.  I\ndrove to the Luxembourg, whence I sent word to Tiberge that I was\nwaiting for him.  I had not to stay many minutes.  I told him without\nhesitation the extremity of my wants.  He asked if the fifty pounds\nwhich I had returned to him would suffice, and he at once went to fetch\nit with that generous air, that pleasure in bestowing which 'blesseth\nhim that gives, and him that takes,' and which can only be known to\nlove or to true friendship.\n\n\"Although I had never entertained a doubt of Tiberge's readiness to\ngrant my request, yet I was surprised at having obtained it on such\neasy terms, that is to say, without a word of reprimand for my\nimpenitence; but I was premature in fancying myself safe from his\nreproaches, for when he had counted out the money, and I was on the\npoint of going away, he begged of me to take a walk with him in the\ngarden.  I had not mentioned Manon's name; he knew nothing of her\nescape; so that his lecture was merely upon my own rash flight from St.\nLazare, and upon his apprehensions lest, instead of profiting by the\nlessons of morality which I had received there, I should again relapse\ninto dissipation.\n\n\"He told me, that having gone to pay me a visit at St. Lazare, the day\nafter my escape, he had been astonished beyond expression at hearing\nthe mode in which I had effected it; that he had afterwards a\nconversation with the Superior; that the good Father had not quite\nrecovered the shock; that he had, however, the generosity to conceal\nthe real circumstances from the lieutenant-general of police, and that\nhe had prevented the death of the porter from becoming known outside\nthe walls; that I had, therefore, upon that score, no ground for alarm,\nbut that, if I retained one grain of prudence, I should profit by this\nhappy turn which Providence had given to my affairs, and begin by\nwriting to my father, and reconciling myself to his favour; and finally\nthat, if I would be guided by his advice, I should at once quit Paris,\nand return to the bosom of my family.\n\n\"I listened to him attentively till he had finished.  There was much in\nwhat he said to gratify me.  In the first place, I was delighted to\nlearn that I had nothing to fear on account of St. Lazare--the streets\nof Paris at least were again open to me. Then I rejoiced to find that\nTiberge had no suspicion of Manon's escape, and her return to my arms.\nI even remarked that he had not mentioned her name, probably from the\nidea that, by my seeming indifference to her, she had become less dear\nto my heart.  I resolved, if not to return home, at least to write to\nmy father, as he advised me, and to assure him that I was disposed to\nreturn to my duty, and consult his wishes.  My intention was to urge\nhim to send me money for the purpose of pursuing my ordinary studies at\nthe University, for I should have found it difficult to persuade him\nthat I had any inclination to resume my ecclesiastical habit.  I was in\ntruth not at all averse to what I was now going to promise him.  On the\ncontrary, I was ready to apply myself to some creditable and rational\npursuit, so far as the occupation would be compatible with my love.  I\nreckoned upon being able to live with my mistress, and at the same time\ncontinuing my studies.  I saw no inconsistency in this plan.\n\n\"These thoughts were so satisfactory to my mind, that I promised\nTiberge to dispatch a letter by that day's post to my father: in fact,\non leaving him, I went into a scrivener's, and wrote in such a\nsubmissive and dutiful tone, that, on reading over my own letter, I\nanticipated the triumph I was going to achieve over my father's heart.\n\n\"Although I had money enough to pay for a hackney-coach after my\ninterview with Tiberge, I felt a pleasure in walking independently\nthrough the streets to M. de T----'s house.  There was great comfort in\nthis unaccustomed exercise of my liberty, as to which my friend had\nassured me I had nothing now to apprehend. However, it suddenly\noccurred to me, that he had been only referring to St. Lazare, and that\nI had the other affair of the Hospital on my hands; being implicated,\nif not as an accomplice, at all events as a witness.  This thought\nalarmed me so much, that I slipped down the first narrow street, and\ncalled a coach. I went at once to M. de T----'s, and he laughed at my\napprehensions.  I myself thought them ridiculous enough, when he\ninformed me that there was no more danger from Lescaut's affray, than\nfrom the Hospital adventure.  He told me that, from the fear of their\nsuspecting that he had a hand in Manon's escape, he had gone that\nmorning to the Hospital and asked to see her, pretending not to know\nanything of what had happened; that they were so far from entertaining\nthe least suspicion of either of us, that they lost no time in relating\nthe adventure as a piece of news to him; and that they wondered how so\npretty a girl as Manon Lescaut could have thought of eloping with a\nservant: that he replied with seeming indifference, that it by no means\nastonished him, for people would do anything for the sake of liberty.\n\n\"He continued to tell me how he then went to Lescaut's apartments, in\nthe hope of finding me there with my dear mistress; that the master of\nthe house, who was a coachmaker, protested he had seen neither me nor\nManon; but that it was no wonder that we had not appeared there, if our\nobject was to see Lescaut, for that we must have doubtless heard of his\nhaving been assassinated about the very same time; upon which, he\nrelated all that he knew of the cause and circumstances of the murder.\n\n\"About two hours previously, a guardsman of Lescaut's acquaintance had\ncome to see him, and proposed play.  Lescaut had such a rapid and\nextravagant run of luck, that in an hour the young man was minus twelve\nhundred francs--all the money he had. Finding himself without a sou, he\nbegged of Lescaut to lend him half the sum he had lost; and there being\nsome difficulty on this point, an angry quarrel arose between them.\nLescaut had refused to give him the required satisfaction, and the\nother swore, on quitting him, that he would take his life; a threat\nwhich he carried into execution the same night.  M. de T---- was kind\nenough to add, that he had felt the utmost anxiety on our account, and\nthat, such as they were, he should gladly continue to us his services.\nI at once told him the place of our retreat. He begged of me to allow\nhim to sup with us.\n\n\"As I had nothing more to do than to procure the linen and clothes for\nManon, I told him that we might start almost immediately, if he would\nbe so good as to wait for me a moment while I went into one or two\nshops.  I know not whether he suspected that I made this proposition\nwith the view of calling his generosity into play, or whether it was by\nthe mere impulse of a kind heart; but, having consented to start\nimmediately, he took me to a shopkeeper, who had lately furnished his\nhouse.  He there made me select several articles of a much higher price\nthan I had proposed to myself; and when I was about paying the bill, he\ndesired the man not to take a sou from me.  This he did so gracefully,\nthat I felt no shame in accepting his present.  We then took the road\nto Chaillot together, where I arrived much more easy in mind than when\nI had left it that morning.\n\n\"My return and the polite attentions of M. de T---- dispelled all\nManon's melancholy.  'Let us forget our past annoyances, my dear soul,'\nsaid I to her, 'and endeavour to live a still happier life than before.\nAfter all, there are worse masters than love: fate cannot subject us to\nas much sorrow as love enables us to taste of happiness.'  Our supper\nwas a true scene of joy.\n\n\"In possession of Manon and of twelve hundred and fifty francs, I was\nprouder and more contented than the richest voluptuary of Paris with\nuntold treasures.  Wealth should be measured by the means it affords us\nof satisfying our desires.  There did not remain to me at this moment a\nsingle wish unaccomplished.  Even the future gave me little concern.  I\nfelt a hope, amounting almost to certainty, that my father would allow\nme the means of living respectably in Paris, because I had become\nentitled, on entering upon my twentieth year, to a share of my mother's\nfortune.  I did not conceal from Manon what was the extent of my\npresent wealth; but I added, that it might suffice to support us until\nour fortune was bettered, either by the inheritance I have just alluded\nto, or by the resources of the hazard-table.\"\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nThis Passion hath its floods in the very times of weakness, which are\ngreat prosperity, and great adversity; both which times kindle Love,\nand make it more fervent.--BACON.\n\n\n\"For several weeks I thus continued to think only of enjoying the full\nluxury of my situation; and being restrained, by a sense of honour, as\nwell as a lurking apprehension of the police, from renewing my intimacy\nwith my former companions at the hotel of Transylvania, I began to play\nin certain coteries less notorious, where my good luck rendered it\nunnecessary for me to have recourse to my former accomplishments.  I\npassed a part of the afternoon in town, and returned always to supper\nat Chaillot, accompanied very often by M. de T----, whose intimacy and\nfriendship for us daily increased.\n\n\"Manon soon found resources against ennui.  She became acquainted with\nsome young ladies, whom the spring brought into the neighbourhood.\nThey occupied their leisure hours in walking, and the customary\namusements of persons of their sex and age. Their little gains at cards\n(always within innocent limits) were laid out in defraying the expense\nof a coach, in which they took an airing occasionally in the Bois de\nBoulogne; and each night when I returned, I was sure of finding Manon\nmore beautiful--more contented--more affectionate than ever.\n\n\"There arose, however, certain clouds, which seemed to threaten the\ncontinuance of this blissful tranquillity, but they were soon\ndispelled; and Manon's sprightliness made the affair so excessively\ncomical in its termination, that it is even now pleasing to recur to\nit, as a proof of the tenderness as well as the cheerfulness of her\ndisposition.\n\n\"The only servant we had came to me one day, with great embarrassment,\nand taking me aside, told me that he had a secret of the utmost\nimportance to communicate to me.  I urged him to explain himself\nwithout reserve.  After some hesitation, he gave me to understand that\na foreigner of high rank had apparently fallen in love with Manon.  I\nfelt my blood boil at the announcement.  'Has she shown any penchant\nfor him?'  I enquired, interrupting my informant with more impatience\nthan was requisite, if I desired to have a full explanation.\n\n\"He was alarmed at my excitement; and replied in an undecided tone,\nthat he had not made sufficiently minute observation to satisfy me; but\nthat, having noticed for several days together the regular arrival of\nthe stranger at the Bois de Boulogne, where, quitting his carriage, he\nwalked by himself in the cross-avenues, appearing to seek opportunities\nof meeting Manon, it had occurred to him to form an acquaintance with\nthe servants, in order to discover the name of their master; that they\nspoke of him as an Italian prince, and that they also suspected he was\nupon some adventure of gallantry.  He had not been able to learn\nanything further, he added, trembling as he spoke, because the prince,\nthen on the point of leaving the wood, had approached him, and with the\nmost condescending familiarity asked his name; upon which, as if he at\nonce knew that he was in our service, he congratulated him on having,\nfor his mistress, the most enchanting person upon earth.\n\n\"I listened to this recital with the greatest impatience.  He ended\nwith the most awkward excuses, which I attributed to the premature and\nimprudent display of my own agitation.  In vain I implored him to\ncontinue his history.  He protested that he knew nothing more, and that\nwhat he had previously told me, having only happened the preceding day,\nhe had not had a second opportunity of seeing the prince's servants.  I\nencouraged him, not only with praises, but with a substantial\nrecompense; and without betraying the slightest distrust of Manon, I\nrequested him, in the mildest manner, to keep strict watch upon all the\nforeigner's movements.\n\n\"In truth, the effect of his fright was to leave me in a state of the\ncruellest suspense.  It was possible that she had ordered him to\nsuppress part of the truth.  However, after a little reflection, I\nrecovered sufficiently from my fears to see the manner in which I had\nexposed my weaknesses.  I could hardly consider it a crime in Manon to\nbe loved.  Judging from appearances, it was probable that she was not\neven aware of her conquest.  'And what kind of life shall I in future\nlead,' thought I, 'if I am capable of letting jealousy so easily take\npossession of my mind?'\n\n\"I returned on the following day to Paris, with no other intention than\nto hasten the improvement of my fortune, by playing deeper than ever,\nin order to be in a condition to quit Chaillot on the first real\noccasion for uneasiness.  That night I learned nothing at all\ncalculated to trouble my repose.  The foreigner had, as usual, made his\nappearance in the Bois de Boulogne; and venturing, from what had passed\nthe preceding day, to accost my servant more familiarly, he spoke to\nhim openly of his passion, but in such terms as not to lead to the\nslightest suspicion of Manon's being aware of it.  He put a thousand\nquestions to him, and at last tried to bribe him with large promises;\nand taking a letter from his pocket, he in vain entreated him, with the\npromise of some louis d'ors, to convey it to her.\n\n\"Two days passed without anything more occurring: the third was of a\ndifferent character.  I learned on my arrival, later than usual, from\nParis, that Manon, while in the wood, had left her companions for a\nmoment, and that the foreigner, who had followed her at a short\ndistance, approached, upon her making him a sign, and that she handed\nhim a letter, which he took with a transport of joy.  He had only time\nto express his delight by kissing the billet-doux, for she was out of\nsight in an instant.  But she appeared in unusually high spirits the\nremainder of the day; and even after her return to our lodgings, her\ngaiety continued.  I trembled at every word.\n\n\"'Are you perfectly sure,' said I, in an agony of fear, to my servant,\n'that your eyes have not deceived you?'  He called Heaven to witness\nthe truth of what he had told me.\n\n\"I know not to what excess the torments of my mind would have driven\nme, if Manon, who heard me come in, had not met me with an air of\nimpatience, and complained of my delay.  Before I had time to reply,\nshe loaded me with caresses; and when she found we were alone, she\nreproached me warmly with the habit I was contracting of staying out so\nlate.  My silence gave her an opportunity of continuing; and she then\nsaid that for the last three weeks I had never spent one entire day in\nher society; that she could not endure such prolonged absence; that she\nshould at least expect me to give up a day to her from time to time,\nand that she particularly wished me to be with her on the following day\nfrom morning till night.\n\n\"'You may be very certain I shall do that,' said I, in rather a sharp\ntone.  She did not appear to notice my annoyance; she seemed to me to\nhave more than her usual cheerfulness; and she described, with infinite\npleasantry, the manner in which she had spent the day.\n\n\"'Incomprehensible girl!\" said I to myself; 'what am I to expect after\nsuch a prelude?' The adventures of my first separation occurred to me;\nnevertheless, I fancied I saw in her cheerfulness, and the affectionate\nreception she gave me, an air of truth that perfectly accorded with her\nprofessions.\n\n\"It was an easy matter at supper to account for the low spirits which I\ncould not conceal, by attributing them to a loss I had that day\nsustained at the gaming-table.  I considered it most fortunate that the\nidea of my remaining all the next day at Chaillot was suggested by\nherself: I should thus have ample time for deliberation.  My presence\nwould prevent any fears for at least the next day; and if nothing\nshould occur to compel me to disclose the discovery I had already made,\nI was determined on the following day to move my establishment into\ntown, and fix myself in a quarter where I should have nothing to\napprehend from the interference of princes.  This arrangement made me\npass the night more tranquilly, but it by no means put an end to the\nalarm I felt at the prospect of a new infidelity.\n\n\"When I awoke in the morning, Manon said to me, that although we were\nto pass the day at home, she did not at all wish that I should be less\ncarefully dressed than on other occasions; and that she had a\nparticular fancy for doing the duties of my toilette that morning with\nher own hands.  It was an amusement she often indulged in: but she\nappeared to take more pains on this occasion than I had ever observed\nbefore.  To gratify her, I was obliged to sit at her toilette table,\nand try all the different modes she imagined for dressing my hair.  In\nthe course of the operation, she made me often turn my head round\ntowards her, and putting both hands upon my shoulders, she would\nexamine me with most anxious curiosity: then, showing her approbation\nby one or two kisses, she would make me resume my position before the\nglass, in order to continue her occupation.\n\n\"This amatory trifling engaged us till dinner-time.  The pleasure she\nseemed to derive from it, and her more than usual gaiety, appeared to\nme so thoroughly natural, that I found it impossible any longer to\nsuspect the treason I had previously conjured up; and I was several\ntimes on the point of candidly opening my mind to her, and throwing off\na load that had begun to weigh heavily upon my heart: but I flattered\nmyself with the hope that the explanation would every moment come from\nherself, and I anticipated the delicious triumph this would afford me.\n\n\"We returned to her boudoir.  She began again to put my hair in order,\nand I humoured all her whims; when they came to say that the Prince of\n---- was below, and wished to see her.  The name alone almost threw me\ninto a rage.\n\n\"'What then,' exclaimed I, as I indignantly pushed her from me,\n'who?--what prince?'\n\n\"She made no answer to my enquiries.\n\n\"'Show him upstairs,' said she coolly to the servant; and then turning\ntowards me, 'Dearest love! you whom I so fervently adore,' she added in\nthe most bewitching tone, 'I only ask of you one moment's patience; one\nmoment, one single moment!  I will love you ten thousand times more\nthan ever: your compliance now shall never, during my life, be\nforgotten.'\n\n\"Indignation and astonishment deprived me of the power of utterance.\nShe renewed her entreaties, and I could not find adequate expressions\nto convey my feelings of anger and contempt. But hearing the door of\nthe ante-chamber open, she grasped with one hand my locks, which were\nfloating over my shoulders, while she took her toilette mirror in the\nother, and with all her strength led me in this manner to the door of\nthe boudoir, which she opened with her knee, and presented to the\nforeigner, who had been prevented by the noise he heard inside from\nadvancing beyond the middle of the ante-chamber, a spectacle that must\nhave indeed amazed him.  I saw a man extremely well dressed, but with a\nparticularly ill-favoured countenance.\n\n\"Notwithstanding his embarrassment, he made her a profound bow. Manon\ngave him no time for speech-making; she held up the mirror before him:\n'Look, sir,' said she to him, 'observe yourself minutely, and I only\nask you then to do me justice.  You wish me to love you: this is the\nman whom I love, and whom I have sworn to love during my whole life:\nmake the comparison yourself.  If you think you can rival him in my\naffections, tell me at least upon what pretensions; for I solemnly\ndeclare to you, that, in the estimation of your most obedient humble\nservant, all the princes in Italy are not worth a single one of the\nhairs I now hold in my hand.'\n\n\"During this whimsical harangue, which she had apparently prepared\nbeforehand, I tried in vain to disengage myself, and feeling compassion\nfor a person of such consideration, I was desirous, by my politeness at\nleast, of making some reparation for this little outrage.  But\nrecovering his self-possession with the ease of a man accustomed to the\nworld, he put an end to my feelings of pity by his reply, which was, in\nmy opinion, rude enough.\n\n\"'Young lady! young lady!' said he to her, with a sardonic smile, 'my\neyes in truth are opened, and I perceive that you are much less of a\nnovice than I had pictured to myself.'\n\n\"He immediately retired without looking at her again, muttering to\nhimself that the French women were quite as bad as those of Italy.  I\nfelt little desire, on this occasion, to change his opinion of the fair\nsex.\n\n\"Manon let go my hand, threw herself into an armchair, and made the\nroom resound with her shouts of laughter.  I candidly confess that I\nwas touched most sensibly by this unexpected proof of her affection,\nand by the sacrifice of her own interest which I had just witnessed,\nand which she could only have been induced to make by her excessive\nlove for me.  Still, however, I could not help thinking she had gone\nrather too far.  I reproached her with what I called her indiscretion.\nShe told me that my rival, after having besieged her for several days\nin the Bois de Boulogne, and having made her comprehend his object by\nsigns and grimaces, had actually made an open declaration of love;\ninforming her at the same time of his name and all his titles, by means\nof a letter, which he had sent through the hands of the coachman who\ndrove her and her companions; that he had promised her, on the other\nside of the Alps, a brilliant fortune and eternal adoration; that she\nreturned to Chaillot, with the intention of relating to me the whole\nadventure, but that, fancying it might be made a source of amusement to\nus, she could not help gratifying her whim; that she accordingly\ninvited the Italian prince, by a flattering note, to pay her a visit;\nand that it had afforded her equal delight to make me an accomplice,\nwithout giving me the least suspicion of her plan.  I said not a word\nof the information I had received through another channel; and the\nintoxication of triumphant love made me applaud all she had done.\"\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\n  'Twas ever thus;--from childhood's hour\n    I've seen my fondest hopes decay;--\n  I never loved a tree or flower,\n    But it was sure to fade away;\n  I never nursed a dear Gazelle,\n    To glad me with its dark-blue eye,\n  But, when it came to know me well,\n    And love me, it was sure to die.\n        MOORE.\n\n\n\"During my life I have remarked that fate has invariably chosen for the\ntime of its severest visitations, those moments when my fortune seemed\nestablished on the firmest basis.  In the friendship of M. de T----,\nand the tender affections of Manon, I imagined myself so thoroughly\nhappy, that I could not harbour the slightest apprehension of any new\nmisfortune: there was one, nevertheless, at this very period impending,\nwhich reduced me to the state in which you beheld me at Passy, and\nwhich eventually brought in its train miseries of so deplorable a\nnature, that you will have difficulty in believing the simple recital\nthat follows.\n\n\"One evening, when M. de T---- remained to sup with us, we heard the\nsound of a carriage stopping at the door of the inn. Curiosity tempted\nus to see who it was that arrived at this hour. They told us it was\nyoung G---- M----, the son of our most vindictive enemy, of that\ndebauched old sinner who had incarcerated me in St. Lazare, and Manon\nin the Hospital.  His name made the blood mount to my cheeks.  'It is\nProvidence that has led him here,' said I to M. de T----, that I may\npunish him for the cowardly baseness of his father.  He shall not\nescape without our measuring swords at least.'  M. de T----, who knew\nhim, and was even one of his most intimate friends, tried to moderate\nmy feelings of anger towards him.  He assured me that he was a most\namiable young man, and so little capable of countenancing his father's\nconduct, that I could not be many minutes in his society without\nfeeling esteem and affection for him.  After saying many more things in\nhis praise, he begged my permission to invite him to come and sit in\nour apartment, as well as to share the remainder of our supper.  As to\nthe objection of Manon being exposed by this proceeding to any danger,\nhe pledged his honour and good faith, that when once the young man\nbecame acquainted with us, we should find in him a most zealous\ndefender.  After such an assurance, I could offer no further opposition.\n\n\"M. de T---- did not introduce him without delaying a few moments\noutside, to let him know who we were.  He certainly came in with an air\nthat prepossessed us in his favour: he shook hands with me; we sat\ndown; he admired Manon; he appeared pleased with me, and with\neverything that belonged to us; and he ate with an appetite that did\nabundant honour to our hospitality.\n\n\"When the table was cleared, our conversation became more serious.  He\nhung down his head while he spoke of his father's conduct towards us.\nHe made, on his own part, the most submissive excuses.  'I say the less\nupon the subject,' said he, 'because I do not wish to recall a\ncircumstance that fills me with grief and shame.'  If he were sincere\nin the beginning, he became much more so in the end, for the\nconversation had not lasted half an hour, when I perceived that Manon's\ncharms had made a visible impression upon him.  His looks and his\nmanner became by degrees more tender.  He, however, allowed no\nexpression to escape him; but, without even the aid of jealousy, I had\nhad experience enough in love affairs to discern what was passing.\n\n\"He remained with us till a late hour in the night, and before he took\nhis leave, congratulated himself on having made our acquaintance, and\nbegged permission to call and renew the offer of his services.  He went\noff next morning with M. de T----, who accepted the offer of a seat in\nhis carriage.\n\n\"I felt, as I before said, not the slightest symptom of jealousy: I had\na more foolish confidence than ever in Manon's vows.  This dear\ncreature had so absolute a dominion over my whole soul and affections,\nthat I could give place to no other sentiment towards her than that of\nadmiration and love.  Far from considering it a crime that she should\nhave pleased young G---- M----, I was gratified by the effect of her\ncharms, and experienced only a feeling of pride in being loved by a\ngirl whom the whole world found so enchanting.  I did not even deem it\nworth while to mention my suspicions to her.  We were for some days\noccupied in arranging her new wardrobe, and in considering whether we\nmight venture to the theatre without the risk of being recognised.  M.\nde T---- came again to see us before the end of the week, and we\nconsulted him upon this point.  He saw clearly that the way to please\nManon was to say yes: we resolved to go all together that same evening.\n\n\"We were not able, however, to carry this intention into effect; for,\nhaving taken me aside, 'I have been in the greatest embarrassment,'\nsaid he to me, 'since I saw you, and that is the cause of my visiting\nyou today.  G---- M---- is in love with your mistress: he told me so in\nconfidence; I am his intimate friend, and disposed to do him any\nservice in my power; but I am not less devoted to you; his designs\nappeared to me unjustifiable, and I expressed my disapprobation of\nthem; I should not have divulged his secret, if he had only intended to\nuse fair and ordinary means for gaining Manon's affections; but he is\naware of her capricious disposition; he has learned, God knows how,\nthat her ruling passion is for affluence and pleasure; and, as he is\nalready in possession of a considerable fortune, he declared his\nintention of tempting her at once with a present of great value, and\nthe offer of an annuity of six thousand francs; if I had in all other\npoints considered you both in an equal light, I should have had perhaps\nto do more violence to my feelings in betraying him: but a sense of\njustice as well as of friendship was on your side, and the more so from\nhaving been myself the imprudent, though unconscious, cause of his\npassion in introducing him here. I feel it my duty therefore to avert\nany evil consequences from the mischief I have inadvertently caused.\n\n\"I thanked M. de T---- for rendering me so important a service, and\nconfessed to him, in a like spirit of confidence, that Manon's\ndisposition was precisely what G---- M---- had imagined; that is to\nsay, that she was incapable of enduring even the thought of poverty.\n'However,' said I to him, 'when it is a mere question of more or less,\nI do not believe that she would give me up for any other person; I can\nafford to let her want for nothing, and I have from day to day reason\nto hope that my fortune will improve; I only dread one thing,'\ncontinued I, 'which is, that G---- M---- may take unfair advantage of\nthe knowledge he has of our place of residence, and bring us into\ntrouble by disclosing it.'\n\n\"M. de T---- assured me that I might be perfectly easy upon that head;\nthat G---- M---- might be capable of a silly passion, but not of an act\nof baseness; that if he ever could be villain enough for such a thing,\nhe, de T----, would be the first to punish him, and by that means make\nreparation for the mischief he had occasioned.  'I feel grateful for\nwhat you say,' said I, 'but the mischief will have been all done, and\nthe remedy even seems doubtful; the wisest plan therefore will be to\nquit Chaillot, and go to reside elsewhere.'  'Very true,' said M. de\nT----, 'but you will not be able to do it quickly enough, for G----\nM---- is to be here at noon; he told me so yesterday, and it was that\nintelligence that made me come so early this morning to inform you of\nhis intentions.  You may expect him every moment.'\"\n\n\"The urgency of the occasion made me view this matter in a more serious\nlight.  As it seemed to me impossible to escape the visit of G----\nM----, and perhaps equally so to prevent him from making his\ndeclaration to Manon, I resolved to tell her beforehand of the designs\nof my new rival.  I fancied that when she knew I was aware of the\noffers that would be made to her, and made probably in my presence, she\nwould be the more likely to reject them.  I told M. de T---- of my\nintention, and he observed that he thought it a matter of extreme\ndelicacy.  'I admit it,' said I, 'but no man ever had more reason for\nconfiding in a mistress, than I have for relying on the affection of\nmine.  The only thing that could possibly for a moment blind her, is\nthe splendour of his offers; no doubt she loves her ease, but she loves\nme also; and in my present circumstances, I cannot believe that she\nwould abandon me for the son of the man who had incarcerated her in the\nMagdalen.' In fine, I persisted in my intentions, and taking Manon\naside, I candidly told her what I had learned.\n\n\"She thanked me for the good opinion I entertained of her, and promised\nto receive G---- M----'s offers in a way that should prevent a\nrepetition of them.  'No,' said I, 'you must not irritate him by\nincivility: he has it in his power to injure us. But you know well\nenough, you little rogue,' continued I, smiling, 'how to rid yourself\nof a disagreeable or useless lover!'  After a moment's pause she said:\n'I have just thought of an admirable plan, and I certainly have a\nfertile invention. G---- M---- is the son of our bitterest enemy: we\nmust avenge ourselves on the father, not through the son's person, but\nthrough his purse.  My plan is to listen to his proposals, accept his\npresents, and then laugh at him.'\n\n\"'The project is not a bad one,' said I to her; 'but you forget, my\ndear child, that it is precisely the same course that conducted us\nformerly to the penitentiary.'  I represented to her the danger of such\nan enterprise; she replied, that the only thing necessary was to take\nour measures with caution, and she found an answer to every objection I\nstarted.  'Show me the lover who does not blindly humour every whim of\nan adored mistress, and I will then allow that I was wrong in yielding\nso easily on this occasion.'  The resolution was taken to make a dupe\nof G----M----, and by an unforeseen and unlucky turn of fortune, I\nbecame the victim myself.\n\n\"About eleven o'clock his carriage drove up to the door.  He made the\nmost complaisant and refined speeches upon the liberty he had taken of\ncoming to dine with us uninvited.  He was not surprised at meeting M.\nde T----, who had the night before promised to meet him there, and who\nhad, under some pretext or other, refused a seat in his carriage.\nAlthough there was not a single person in the party who was not at\nheart meditating treachery, we all sat down with an air of mutual\nconfidence and friendship.  G---- M---- easily found an opportunity of\ndeclaring his sentiments to Manon.  I did not wish to annoy him by\nappearing vigilant, so I left the room purposely for several minutes.\n\n\"I perceived on my return that he had not had to encounter any very\ndiscouraging austerity on Manon's part, for he was in the best possible\nspirits.  I affected good humour also.  He was laughing in his mind at\nmy simplicity, while I was not less diverted by his own.  During the\nwhole evening we were thus supplying to each other an inexhaustible\nfund of amusement.  I contrived, before his departure, to let him have\nManon for another moment to himself; so that he had reason to applaud\nmy complaisance, as well as the hospitable reception I had given him.\n\n\"As soon as he got into his carriage with M. de T----, Manon ran\ntowards me with extended arms, and embraced me; laughing all the while\nimmoderately.  She repeated all his speeches and proposals, without\naltering a word.  This was the substance:  He of course adored her; and\nwished to share with her a large fortune of which he was already in\npossession, without counting what he was to inherit at his father's\ndeath.  She should be sole mistress of his heart and fortune; and as an\nimmediate token of his liberality, he was ready at once to supply her\nwith an equipage, a furnished house, a lady's maid, three footmen, and\na man-cook.\n\n\"'There is indeed a son,' said I, 'very different from his father! But\ntell me truly, now, does not such an offer tempt you?' 'Me!' she\nreplied, adapting to the idea two verses from Racine--\n\n  Moi! vous me soupconnez de cette perfidie?\n  Moi! je pourrais souffrir un visage odieux,\n  Qui rappelle toujours l'Hopital a mes yeux?\n\n\n'No!' replied I, continuing the parody--\n\n  J'aurais peine a penser que l'Hopital, madame,\n  Fut un trait dont l'amour l'eut grave dans votre ame.\n\n'But it assuredly is a temptation--a furnished house, a lady's maid, a\ncook, a carriage, and three servants--gallantry can offer but few more\nseductive temptations.'\n\n\"She protested that her heart was entirely mine, and that it was for\nthe future only open to the impressions I chose to make upon it.  'I\nlook upon his promises,' said she, 'as an instrument for revenge,\nrather than as a mark of love.'  I asked her if she thought of\naccepting the hotel and the carriage.  She replied that his money was\nall she wanted.\"\n\nThe difficulty was, how to obtain the one without the other; we\nresolved to wait for a detailed explanation of the whole project in a\nletter which G---- M---- promised to write to her, and which in fact\nshe received next morning by a servant out of livery, who, very\ncleverly, contrived an opportunity of speaking to her alone.\n\nShe told him to wait for an answer, and immediately brought the letter\nto me: we opened it together.\n\n\"Passing over the usual commonplace expressions of tenderness, it gave\na particular detail of my rival's promises.  There were no limits to\nthe expense.  He engaged to pay her down ten thousand francs on her\ntaking possession of the hotel, and to supply her expenditure in such a\nway as that she should never have less than that sum at her command.\nThe appointed day for her entering into possession was close at hand.\nHe only required two days for all his preparations, and he mentioned\nthe name of the street and the hotel, where he promised to be in\nwaiting for her in the afternoon of the second day, if she could manage\nto escape my vigilance.  That was the only point upon which he begged\nof her to relieve his uneasiness; he seemed to be quite satisfied upon\nevery other: but he added that, if she apprehended any difficulty in\nescaping from me, he could find sure means for facilitating her flight.\n\n\"G---- M---- the younger was more cunning than the old gentleman.  He\nwanted to secure his prey before he counted out the cash.  We\nconsidered what course Manon should adopt.  I made another effort to\ninduce her to give up the scheme, and strongly represented all its\ndangers; nothing, however, could shake her determination.\n\n\"Her answer to G---- M---- was brief, merely assuring him that she\ncould be, without the least difficulty, in Paris on the appointed day\nand that he might expect her with certainty.\n\n\"We then resolved, that I should instantly hire lodgings in some\nvillage on the other side of Paris, and that I should take our luggage\nwith me; that in the afternoon of the following day, which was the time\nappointed, she should go to Paris; that, after receiving G---- M----'s\npresents, she should earnestly entreat him to take her to the theatre;\nthat she should carry with her as large a portion of the money as she\ncould, and charge my servant with the remainder, for it was agreed that\nhe was to accompany her.  He was the man who had rescued her from the\nMagdalen, and he was devotedly attached to us.  I was to be with a\nhackney-coach at the end of the street of St. Andre-des-arcs, and to\nleave it there about seven o'clock, while I stole, under cover of the\ntwilight, to the door of the theatre.  Manon promised to make some\nexcuse for quitting her box for a moment, when she would come down and\njoin me.  The rest could be easily done.  We were then to return to my\nhackney-coach, and quit Paris by the Faubourg St. Antoine, which was\nthe road to our new residence.\n\n\"This plan, extravagant as it was, appeared to us satisfactorily\narranged.  But our greatest folly was in imagining that, succeed as we\nmight in its execution, it would be possible for us to escape the\nconsequences.  Nevertheless, we exposed ourselves to all risk with the\nblindest confidence.  Manon took her departure with Marcel--so was the\nservant called.  I could not help feeling a pang as she took leave of\nme.  'Manon,' said I, 'do not deceive me; will you be faithful to me?'\nShe complained, in the tenderest tone, of my want of confidence, and\nrenewed all her protestations of eternal love.\n\n\"She was to be in Paris at three o'clock.  I went some time after.  I\nspent the remainder of the afternoon moping in the Cafe de Fere, near\nthe Pont St. Michel.  I remained there till nightfall.  I then hired a\nhackney-coach, which I placed, according to our plan, at the end of the\nstreet of St. Andre-des-arcs, and went on foot to the door of the\ntheatre.  I was surprised at not seeing Marcel, who was to have been\nthere waiting for me.  I waited patiently for a full hour, standing\namong a crowd of lackeys, and gazing at every person that passed. At\nlength, seven o'clock having struck, without my being able to discover\nanything or any person connected with our project, I procured a pit\nticket, in order to ascertain if Manon and G---- M---- were in the\nboxes.  Neither one nor the other could I find. I returned to the door,\nwhere I again stopped for a quarter of an hour, in an agony of\nimpatience and uneasiness.  No person appeared, and I went back to the\ncoach, without knowing what to conjecture.  The coachman, seeing me,\nadvanced a few paces towards me, and said, with a mysterious air, that\na very handsome young person had been waiting more than an hour for me\nin the coach; that she described me so exactly that he could not be\nmistaken, and having learned that I intended to return, she said she\nwould enter the coach and wait with patience.\n\n\"I felt confident that it was Manon.  I approached.  I beheld a very\npretty face, certainly, but alas, not hers.  The lady asked, in a voice\nthat I had never before heard, whether she had the honour of speaking\nto the Chevalier des Grieux?  I answered, 'That is my name.'  'I have a\nletter for you,' said she, 'which will tell you what has brought me\nhere, and by what means I learned your name.'  I begged she would allow\nme a few moments to read it in an adjoining cafe.  She proposed to\nfollow me, and advised me to ask for a private room, to which I\nconsented.  'Who is the writer of this letter?' I enquired.  She\nreferred me to the letter itself.\n\n\"I recognised Manon's hand.  This is nearly the substance of the\nletter:  G---- M---- had received her with a politeness and\nmagnificence beyond anything she had previously conceived.  He had\nloaded her with the most gorgeous presents.  She had the prospect of\nalmost imperial splendour.  She assured me, however, that she could not\nforget me amidst all this magnificence; but that, not being able to\nprevail on G---- M---- to take her that evening to the play, she was\nobliged to defer the pleasure of seeing me; and that, as a slight\nconsolation for the disappointment which she feared this might cause\nme, she had found a messenger in one of the loveliest girls in all\nParis. She signed herself, 'Your loving and constant, MANON LESCAUT.'\n\n\"There was something so cruel and so insulting in the letter, that,\nwhat between indignation and grief, I resolutely determined to forget\neternally my ungrateful and perjured mistress.  I looked at the young\nwoman who stood before me: she was exceedingly pretty, and I could have\nwished that she had been sufficiently so to render me inconstant in my\nturn.  But there were wanting those lovely and languishing eyes, that\ndivine gracefulness, that exquisite complexion, in fine, those\ninnumerable charms which nature had so profusely lavished upon the\nperfidious Manon.  'No, no,' said I, turning away from her; 'the\nungrateful wretch who sent you knew in her heart that she was sending\nyou on a useless errand.  Return to her; and tell her from me, to\ntriumph in her crime, and enjoy it, if she can, without remorse.  I\nabandon her in despair, and, at the same time, renounce all women, who,\nwithout her fascination, are no doubt her equals in baseness and\ninfidelity.'\n\n\"I was then on the point of going away, determined never to bestow\nanother thought on Manon: the mortal jealousy that was racking my heart\nlay concealed under a dark and sullen melancholy, and I fancied,\nbecause I felt none of those violent emotions which I had experienced\nupon former occasions, that I had shaken off my thraldom.  Alas! I was\neven at that moment infinitely more the dupe of love, than of G----\nM---- and Manon.\n\n\"The girl who had brought the letter, seeing me about to depart, asked\nme what I wished her to say to M. G---- M----, and to the lady who was\nwith him?  At this question, I stepped back again into the room, and by\none of those unaccountable transitions that are only known to the\nvictims of violent passion, I passed in an instant from the state of\nsubdued tranquillity which I have just described, into an ungovernable\nfury 'Away!' said I to her, 'tell the traitor G---- M----and his\nabandoned mistress the state of despair into which your accursed\nmission has cast me; but warn them that it shall not be long a source\nof amusement to them, and that my own hands shall be warmed with the\nheart's blood of both!'  I sank back upon a chair; my hat fell on one\nside, and my cane upon the other: torrents of bitter tears rolled down\nmy cheeks.  The paroxysm of rage changed into a profound and silent\ngrief: I did nothing but weep and sigh.  'Approach, my child,\napproach,' said I to the young girl; 'approach, since it is you they\nhave sent to bring me comfort; tell me whether you have any balm to\nadminister for the pangs of despair and rage--any argument to offer\nagainst the crime of self-destruction, which I have resolved upon,\nafter ridding the world of two perfidious monsters.  Yes, approach,'\ncontinued I, perceiving that she advanced with timid and doubtful\nsteps; 'come and dry my sorrows; come and restore peace to my mind;\ncome and tell me that at least you love me: you are handsome--I may\nperhaps love you in return.' The poor child, who was only sixteen or\nseventeen years of age, and who appeared more modest than girls of her\nclass generally are, was thunderstruck at this unusual scene.  She\nhowever gently approached to caress me, when with uplifted hands I\nrudely repulsed her.  'What do you wish with me?' exclaimed I to her.\n'Ah! you are a woman, and of a sex I abhor, and can no longer tolerate;\nthe very gentleness of your look threatens me with some new treason.\nGo, leave me here alone!'  She made me a curtsy without uttering a\nword, and turned to go out.  I called to her to stop:  'Tell me at\nleast,' said I, 'wherefore--how--with what design they sent you here?\nhow did you discover my name, or the place where you could find me?'\n\n\"She told me that she had long known M. G---- M----; that he had sent\nfor her that evening about five o'clock; and that, having followed the\nservant who had been dispatched to her, she was shown into a large\nhouse, where she found him playing at picquet with a beautiful young\nwoman; and that they both charged her to deliver the letter into my\nhands, after telling her that she would find me in a hackney-coach at\nthe bottom of the street of St. Andre.  I asked if they had said\nnothing more.  She blushed while she replied, that they had certainly\nmade her believe that I should be glad of her society.  'They have\ndeceived you too,' said I, 'my poor girl--they have deceived you; you\nare a woman, and probably wish for a lover; but you must find one who\nis rich and happy, and it is not here you will find him.  Return,\nreturn to M. G---- M----; he possesses everything requisite to make a\nman beloved.  He has furnished houses and equipages to bestow, while I,\nwho have nothing but constancy of love to offer, am despised for my\npoverty, and laughed at for my simplicity.'\n\n\"I continued in a tone of sorrow or violence, as these feelings\nalternately took possession of my mind.  However, by the very excess of\nmy agitation, I became gradually so subdued as to be able calmly to\nreflect upon the situation of affairs.  I compared this new misfortune\nwith those which I had already experienced of the same kind, and I\ncould not perceive that there was any more reason for despair now, than\nupon former occasions.  I knew Manon: why then distress myself on\naccount of a calamity which I could not but have plainly foreseen?  Why\nnot rather think of seeking a remedy? there was yet time; I at least\nought not to spare my own exertions, if I wished to avoid the bitter\nreproach of having contributed, by my own indolence, to my misery.  I\nthereupon set about considering every means of raising a gleam of hope.\n\n\"To attempt to take her by main force from the hands of G----M---- was\ntoo desperate a project, calculated only to ruin me, and without the\nslightest probability of succeeding.  But it seemed to me that if I\ncould ensure a moment's interview with her, I could not fail to regain\nmy influence over her affections. I so well knew how to excite her\nsensibilities!  I was so confident of her love for me!  The very whim\neven of sending me a pretty woman by way of consoling me, I would stake\nmy existence, was her idea, and that it was the suggestion of her own\nsincere sympathy for my sufferings.\n\n\"I resolved to exert every nerve to procure an interview.  After a\nmultitude of plans which I canvassed one after another, I fixed upon\nthe following:  M. de T---- had shown so much sincerity in the services\nhe had rendered me, that I could not entertain a doubt of his zeal and\ngood faith.  I proposed to call upon him at once, and make him send for\nG---- M----, under pretence of some important business.  Half an hour\nwould suffice to enable me to see Manon.  I thought it would not be\ndifficult to get introduced into her apartment during G---- M----'s\nabsence.\n\n\"This determination pacified me, and I gave a liberal present to the\ngirl, who was still with me; and in order to prevent her from returning\nto those who had sent her, I took down her address, and half promised\nto call upon her at a later hour.  I then got into the hackney-coach,\nand drove quickly to M. de T----'s.  I was fortunate enough to find him\nat home.  I had been apprehensive upon this point as I went along.  A\nsingle sentence put him in possession of the whole case, as well of my\nsufferings, as of the friendly service I had come to supplicate at his\nhands.\n\n\"He was so astonished to learn that G---- M---- had been able to seduce\nManon from me, that, not being aware that I had myself lent a hand to\nmy own misfortune, he generously offered to assemble his friends, and\nevoke their aid for the deliverance of my mistress.  I told him that\nsuch a proceeding might by its publicity be attended with danger to\nManon and to me.  'Let us risk our lives,' said I, 'only as a last\nresource.  My plan is of a more peaceful nature, and promising at least\nequal success.' He entered without a murmur into all that I proposed;\nso again stating that all I required was, that he should send for G----\nM----, and contrive to keep him an hour or two from home, we at once\nset about our operations.\n\n\"We first of all considered what expedient we could make use of for\nkeeping him out so long a time.  I proposed that he should write a note\ndated from a cafe, begging of him to come there as soon as possible\nupon an affair of too urgent importance to admit of delay.  'I will\nwatch,' added I, 'the moment he quits the house, and introduce myself\nwithout any difficulty, being only known to Manon, and my servant\nMarcel.  You can at the same time tell G----  M----, that the important\naffair upon which you wished to see him was the immediate want of a sum\nof money; that you had just emptied your purse at play, and that you\nhad played on, with continued bad luck, upon credit.  He will require\nsome time to take you to his father's house, where he keeps his money,\nand I shall have quite sufficient for the execution of my plan.'\n\n\"M. de T---- minutely adhered to these directions.  I left him in a\ncafe, where he at once wrote his letter.  I took my station close by\nManon's house.  I saw de T----'s messenger arrive, and G---- M---- come\nout the next moment, followed by a servant. Allowing him barely time to\nget out of the street, I advanced to my deceiver's door, and\nnotwithstanding the anger I felt, I knocked with as much respect as at\nthe portal of a church. Fortunately it was Marcel who opened for me.\nAlthough I had nothing to apprehend from the other servants, I asked\nhim in a low voice if he could conduct me unseen into the room in which\nManon was.  He said that was easily done, by merely ascending the great\nstaircase.  'Come then at once,' said I to him, 'and endeavour to\nprevent anyone from coming up while I am there.'  I reached the\napartment without any difficulty.\n\n\"Manon was reading.  I had there an opportunity of admiring the\nsingular character of this girl.  Instead of being nervous or alarmed\nat my appearance, she scarcely betrayed a symptom of surprise, which\nfew persons, however indifferent, could restrain, on seeing one whom\nthey imagined to be far distant.  'Ah! it is you, my dear love,' said\nshe, approaching to embrace me with her usual tenderness. 'Good\nheavens, how venturesome and foolhardy you are!  Who could have\nexpected to see you in this place!' Instead of embracing her in return,\nI repulsed her with indignation, and retreated two or three paces from\nher.  This evidently disconcerted her.  She remained immovable, and\nfixed her eyes on me, while she changed colour.\n\n\"I was in reality so delighted to behold her once more, that, with so\nmuch real cause for anger, I could hardly bring my lips to upbraid her.\nMy heart, however, felt the cruel outrage she had inflicted upon me. I\nendeavoured to revive the recollection of it in my own mind, in order\nto excite my feelings, and put on a look of stern indignation.  I\nremained silent for a few moments, when I remarked that she observed my\nagitation, and trembled: apparently the effect of her fears.\n\n\"I could not longer endure this spectacle. 'Ah!  Manon,' said I to her\nin the mildest tone, 'faithless and perjured Manon!  How am I to\ncomplain of your conduct?  I see you pale and trembling, and I am still\nso much alive to your slightest sufferings, that I am unwilling to add\nto them by my reproaches.  But, Manon, I tell you that my heart is\npierced with sorrow at your treatment of me--treatment that is seldom\ninflicted but with the purpose of destroying one's life.  This is the\nthird time, Manon; I have kept a correct account; it is impossible to\nforget that.  It is now for you to consider what course you will adopt;\nfor my afflicted heart is no longer capable of sustaining such shocks.\nI know and feel that it must give way, and it is at this moment ready\nto burst with grief.  I can say no more,' added I, throwing myself into\na chair; 'I have hardly strength to speak, or to support myself.'\n\n\"She made me no reply; but when I was seated, she sank down upon her\nknees, and rested her head upon my lap, covering her face with her\nhands.  I perceived in a moment that she was shedding floods of tears.\nHeavens! with what conflicting sensations was I at that instant\nagitated!  'Ah! Manon, Manon,' said I, sighing, 'it is too late to give\nme tears after the death-blow you have inflicted.  You affect a sorrow\nwhich you cannot feel.  The greatest of your misfortunes is no doubt my\npresence, which has been always an obstacle to your happiness.  Open\nyour eyes; look up and see who it is that is here; you will not throw\naway tears of tenderness upon an unhappy wretch whom you have betrayed\nand abandoned.'\n\n\"She kissed my hands without changing her position.  'Inconstant\nManon,' said I again, 'ungrateful and faithless girl, where now are all\nyour promises and your vows?  Capricious and cruel that you are! what\nhas now become of the love that you protested for me this very day?\nJust Heavens,' added I, 'is it thus you permit a traitor to mock you,\nafter having called you so solemnly to witness her vows!  Recompense\nand reward then are for the perjured!  Despair and neglect are the lot\nof fidelity and truth!'\n\n\"These words conveyed even to my own mind a sentiment so bitterly\nsevere, that, in spite of myself, some tears escaped from me.  Manon\nperceived this by the change in my voice.  She at length spoke.  'I\nmust have indeed done something most culpable,' said she, sobbing with\ngrief, 'to have excited and annoyed you to this degree; but, I call\nHeaven to attest my utter unconsciousness of crime, and my innocence of\nall criminal intention!'\n\n\"This speech struck me as so devoid of reason and of truth, that I\ncould not restrain a lively feeling of anger.  'Horrible hypocrisy!'\ncried I; 'I see more plainly than ever that you are dishonest and\ntreacherous.  Now at length I learn your wretched disposition.  Adieu,\nbase creature,' said I, rising from my seat; 'I would prefer death a\nthousand times rather than continue to hold the slightest communication\nwith you.  May Heaven punish me, if I ever again waste upon you the\nsmallest regard!  Live on with your new lover--renounce all feelings of\nhonour--detest me--your love is now a matter to me of utter\ninsignificance!'\n\n\"Manon was so terrified by the violence of my anger, that, remaining on\nher knees by the chair from which I had just before risen, breathless\nand trembling, she fixed her eyes upon me.  I advanced a little farther\ntowards the door, but, unless I had lost the last spark of humanity, I\ncould not continue longer unmoved by such a spectacle.\n\n\"So far, indeed, was I from this kind of stoical indifference, that,\nrushing at once into the very opposite extreme, I returned, or rather\nflew back to her without an instant's reflection.  I lifted her in my\narms; I gave her a thousand tender kisses; I implored her to pardon my\nungovernable temper; I confessed that I was an absolute brute, and\nunworthy of being loved by such an angel.\n\n\"I made her sit down, and throwing myself, in my turn, upon my knees, I\nconjured her to listen to me in that attitude.  Then I briefly\nexpressed all that a submissive and impassioned lover could say most\ntender and respectful.  I supplicated her pardon. She let her arms fall\nover my neck, as she said that it was she who stood in need of\nforgiveness, and begged of me in mercy to forget all the annoyances she\nhad caused me, and that she began, with reason, to fear that I should\nnot approve of what she had to say in her justification.  'Me!' said I\ninterrupting her impatiently; 'I require no justification; I approve of\nall you have done.  It is not for me to demand excuses for anything you\ndo; I am but too happy, too contented, if my dear Manon will only leave\nme master of her affections!  But,' continued I, remembering that it\nwas the crisis of my fate, 'may I not, Manon, all-powerful Manon, you\nwho wield at your pleasure my joys and sorrows, may I not be permitted,\nafter having conciliated you by my submission and all the signs of\nrepentance, to speak to you now of my misery and distress?  May I now\nlearn from your own lips what my destiny is to be, and whether you are\nresolved to sign my death-warrant, by spending even a single night with\nmy rival?'\n\n\"She considered a moment before she replied.  'My good chevalier,' said\nshe, resuming the most tranquil tone, 'if you had only at first\nexplained yourself thus distinctly, you would have spared yourself a\nworld of trouble, and prevented a scene that has really annoyed me.\nSince your distress is the result of jealousy, I could at first have\ncured that by offering to accompany you where you pleased.  But I\nimagined it was caused by the letter which I was obliged to write in\nthe presence of G---- M----, and of the girl whom we sent with it.  I\nthought you might have construed that letter into a mockery; and have\nfancied that, by sending such a messenger, I meant to announce my\nabandonment of you for the sake of G---- M----.  It was this idea that\nat once overwhelmed me with grief; for, innocent as I knew myself to\nbe, I could not but allow that appearances were against me. However,'\ncontinued she, 'I will leave you to judge of my conduct, after I shall\nhave explained the whole truth.'\n\n\"She then told me all that had occurred to her after joining G----\nM----, whom she found punctually awaiting her arrival.  He had in fact\nreceived her in the most princely style.  He showed her through all the\napartments, which were fitted up in the neatest and most correct taste.\nHe had counted out to her in her boudoir ten thousand francs, as well\nas a quantity of jewels, amongst which were the identical pearl\nnecklace and bracelets which she had once before received as a present\nfrom his father. He then led her into a splendid room, which she had\nnot before seen, and in which an exquisite collation was served; she\nwas waited upon by the new servants, whom he had hired purposely for\nher, and whom he now desired to consider themselves as exclusively her\nattendants; the carriage and the horses were afterwards paraded, and he\nthen proposed a game of cards, until supper should be announced.\n\n\"'I acknowledge,' continued Manon, 'that I was dazzled by all this\nmagnificence.  It struck me that it would be madness to sacrifice at\nonce so many good things for the mere sake of carrying off the money\nand the jewels already in my possession; that it was a certain fortune\nmade for both you and me, and that we might pass the remainder of our\nlives most agreeably and comfortably at the expense of G---- M----.\n\n\"'Instead of proposing the theatre, I thought it more prudent to sound\nhis feelings with regard to you, in order to ascertain what facilities\nwe should have for meeting in future, on the supposition that I could\ncarry my project into effect.  I found him of a most tractable\ndisposition.  He asked me how I felt towards you, and if I had not\nexperienced some compunction at quitting you.  I told him that you were\nso truly amiable, and had ever treated me with such undeviating\nkindness, that it was impossible I could hate you.  He admitted that\nyou were a man of merit, and expressed an ardent desire to gain your\nfriendship.\n\n\"'He was anxious to know how I thought you would take my elopement,\nparticularly when you should learn that I was in his hands.  I\nanswered, that our love was of such long standing as to have had time\nto moderate a little; that, besides, you were not in very easy\ncircumstances, and would probably not consider my departure as any\nsevere misfortune, inasmuch as it would relieve you from a burden of no\nvery insignificant nature.  I added that, being perfectly convinced you\nwould take the whole matter rationally, I had not hesitated to tell you\nthat I had some business in Paris; but you had at once consented, and\nthat having accompanied me yourself, you did not seem very uneasy when\nwe separated.\n\n\"'If I thought,' said he to me, 'that he could bring himself to live on\ngood terms with me, I should be too happy to make him a tender of my\nservices and attentions.'  I assured him that, from what I knew of your\ndisposition, I had no doubt you would acknowledge his kindness in a\ncongenial spirit: especially, I added, if he could assist you in your\naffairs, which had become embarrassed since your disagreement with your\nfamily.  He interrupted me by declaring, that he would gladly render\nyou any service in his power, and that if you were disposed to form a\nnew attachment, he would introduce you to an extremely pretty woman,\nwhom he had just given up for me.\n\n\"'I approved of all he said,' she added, 'for fear of exciting any\nsuspicions; and being more and more satisfied of the feasibility of my\nscheme, I only longed for an opportunity of letting you into it, lest\nyou should be alarmed at my not keeping my appointment.  With this view\nI suggested the idea of sending this young lady to you, in order to\nhave an opportunity of writing; I was obliged to have recourse to this\nplan, because I could not see a chance of his leaving me to myself for\na moment.'\n\n\"'He was greatly amused with my proposition; he called his valet, and\nasking him whether he could immediately find his late mistress, he\ndispatched him at once in search of her.  He imagined that she would\nhave to go to Chaillot to meet you, but I told him that, when we\nparted, I promised to meet you again at the theatre, or that, if\nanything should prevent me from going there, you were to wait for me in\na coach at the end of the street of St. Andre; that consequently it\nwould be best to send your new love there, if it were only to save you\nfrom the misery of suspense during the whole night.  I said it would be\nalso necessary to write you a line of explanation, without which you\nwould probably be puzzled by the whole transaction.  He consented; but\nI was obliged to write in his presence; and I took especial care not to\nexplain matters too palpably in my letter.\n\n\"'This is the history,' said Manon, 'of the entire affair.  I conceal\nnothing from you, of either my conduct or my intentions. The girl\narrived; I thought her handsome; and as I doubted not that you would be\nmortified by my absence, I did most sincerely hope that she would be\nable to dissipate something of your ennui: for it is the fidelity of\nthe heart alone that I value.  I should have been too delighted to have\nsent Marcel, but I could not for a single instant find an opportunity\nof telling him what I wished to communicate to you.'  She finished her\nstory by describing the embarrassment into which M. de T----'s letter\nhad thrown G---- M----; 'he hesitated,' said she, 'about leaving, and\nassured me that he should not be long absent; and it is on this account\nthat I am uneasy at seeing you here, and that I betrayed, at your\nappearance, some slight feeling of surprise.'\n\n\"I listened to her with great patience.  There were certainly parts of\nher recital sufficiently cruel and mortifying; for the intention, at\nleast, of the infidelity was so obvious, that she had not even taken\nthe trouble to disguise it.  She could never have imagined that G----\nM---- meant to venerate her as a vestal. She must therefore clearly\nhave made up her mind to pass at least one night with him.  What an\navowal for a lover's ears!  However, I considered myself as partly the\ncause of her guilt, by having been the first to let her know G----\nM----'s sentiments towards her, and by the silly readiness with which I\nentered into this rash project.  Besides, by a natural bent of my mind,\npeculiar I believe to myself, I was duped by the ingenuousness of her\nstory--by that open and winning manner with which she related even the\ncircumstances most calculated to annoy me.  'There is nothing of wanton\nvice,' said I to myself, 'in her transgressions; she is volatile and\nimprudent, but she is sincere and affectionate.'  My love alone\nrendered me blind to all her faults.  I was enchanted at the prospect\nof rescuing her that very night from my rival.  I said to her:  'With\nwhom do you mean to pass the night?'  She was evidently disconcerted by\nthe question, and answered me in an embarrassed manner with BUTS and\nIFS.\n\n\"I felt for her, and interrupted her by saying that I at once expected\nher to accompany me.\n\n\"'Nothing can give me more pleasure,' said she; 'but you don't approve\nthen of my project?'\n\n\"'Is it not enough,' replied I, 'that I approve of all that you have,\nup to this moment, done?'\n\n\"'What,' said she, 'are we not even to take the ten thousand francs\nwith us?  Why, he gave me the money; it is mine.'\n\n\"I advised her to leave everything, and let us think only of escaping\nfor although I had been hardly half an hour with her, I began to dread\nthe return of G---- M----.  However, she so earnestly urged me to\nconsent to our going out with something in our pockets, that I thought\nmyself bound to make her, on my part, some concession, in return for\nall she yielded to me.\n\n\"While we were getting ready for our departure, I heard someone knock\nat the street door.  I felt convinced that it must be G---- M----; and\nin the heat of the moment, I told Manon, that as sure as he appeared I\nwould take his life.  In truth, I felt that I was not sufficiently\nrecovered from my late excitement to be able to restrain my fury if I\nmet him.  Marcel put an end to my uneasiness, by handing me a letter\nwhich he had received for me at the door; it was from M. de T----.\n\n\"He told me that, as G---- M---- had gone to his father's house for the\nmoney which he wanted, he had taken advantage of his absence to\ncommunicate to me an amusing idea that had just come into his head;\nthat it appeared to him, I could not possibly take a more agreeable\nrevenge upon my rival, than by eating his supper, and spending the\nnight in the very bed which he had hoped to share with my mistress; all\nthis seemed to him easy enough, if I could only find two or three men\nupon whom I could depend, of courage sufficient to stop him in the\nstreet, and detain him in custody until next morning; that he would\nundertake to keep him occupied for another hour at least, under some\npretext, which he could devise before G---- M----'s return.\n\n\"I showed the note to Manon; I told her at the same time of the manner\nin which I had procured the interview with her.  My scheme, as well as\nthe new one of M. de T----'s, delighted her: we laughed heartily at it\nfor some minutes; but when I treated it as a mere joke, I was surprised\nat her insisting seriously upon it, as a thing perfectly practicable,\nand too delightful to be neglected.  In vain I enquired where she\nthought I could possibly find, on a sudden, men fit for such an\nadventure? and on whom I could rely for keeping G---- M---- in strict\ncustody?  She said that I should at least try, as M. de T---- ensured\nus yet a full hour; and as to my other objections, she said that I was\nplaying the tyrant, and did not show the slightest indulgence to her\nfancies.  She said that it was impossible there could be a more\nenchanting project.  'You will have his place at supper; you will sleep\nin his bed; and tomorrow, as early as you like, you can walk off with\nboth his mistress and his money.  You may thus, at one blow, be amply\nrevenged upon father and son.'\n\n\"I yielded to her entreaties, in spite of the secret misgivings of my\nown mind, which seemed to forebode the unhappy catastrophe that\nafterwards befell me.  I went out with the intention of asking two or\nthree guardsmen, with whom Lescaut had made me acquainted, to undertake\nthe arrest of G---- M----.  I found only one of them at home, but he\nwas a fellow ripe for any adventure; and he no sooner heard our plan,\nthan he assured me of certain success: all he required were six\npistoles, to reward the three private soldiers whom he determined to\nemploy in the business.  I begged of him to lose no time.  He got them\ntogether in less than a quarter of an hour.  I waited at his lodgings\ntill he returned with them, and then conducted him to the corner of a\nstreet through which I knew G----  M---- must pass in going back to\nManon's house.  I requested him not to treat G---- M---- roughly, but\nto keep him confined, and so strictly watched, until seven o'clock next\nmorning, that I might be free from all apprehension of his escape.  He\ntold me his intention was to bring him a prisoner to his own room, and\nmake him undress and sleep in his bed, while he and his gallant\ncomrades should spend the night in drinking and playing.\n\n\"I remained with them until we saw G---- M---- returning homewards; and\nI then withdrew a few steps into a dark recess in the street, to enjoy\nso entertaining and extraordinary a scene. The officer challenged him\nwith a pistol to his breast, and then told him, in a civil tone, that\nhe did not want either his money or his life; but that if he hesitated\nto follow him, or if he gave the slightest alarm, he would blow his\nbrains out.  G---- M----, seeing that his assailant was supported by\nthree soldiers, and perhaps not uninfluenced by a dread of the pistol,\nyielded without further resistance.  I saw him led away like a lamb.\"\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n  What lost a world, and bade a hero fly?\n  The timid tear in Cleopatra's eye.\n  Yet be the soft triumvir's fault forgiven,\n  By this, how many lose--not earth--but heaven!\n  Consign their souls to man's eternal foe,\n  And seal their own, to spare some wanton's, woe!\n        BYRON.\n\n\nI soon returned to Manon; and to prevent the servants from having any\nsuspicion, I told her in their hearing, that she need not expect M.\nG---- M---- to supper; that he was most reluctantly occupied with\nbusiness which detained him, and that he had commissioned me to come\nand make his excuses, and to fill his place at the supper table; which,\nin the company of so beautiful a lady, I could not but consider a very\nhigh honour.  She seconded me with her usual adroitness.  We sat down\nto supper.  I put on the most serious air I could assume, while the\nservants were in the room, and at length having got rid of them, we\npassed, beyond all comparison, the most agreeable evening of my life.\nI gave Marcel orders to find a hackney-coach, and engage it to be at\nthe gate on the following morning a little before six o'clock.  I\npretended to take leave of Manon about midnight, but easily gaining\nadmission again, through Marcel, I proceeded to occupy G---- M----'s\nbed, as I had filled his place at the supper table.\n\n\"In the meantime our evil genius was at work for our destruction.  We\nwere like children enjoying the success of our silly scheme, while the\nsword hung suspended over our heads.  The thread which upheld it was\njust about to break; but the better to understand all the circumstances\nof our ruin, it is necessary to know the immediate cause.\n\n\"G---- M---- was followed by a servant, when he was stopped by my\nfriend the guardsman.  Alarmed by what he saw, this fellow retraced his\nsteps, and the first thing he did was to go and inform old G---- M----\nof what had just happened.\n\n\"Such a piece of news, of course, excited him greatly.  This was his\nonly son; and considering the old gentleman's advanced age, he was\nextremely active and ardent.  He first enquired of the servant what his\nson had been doing that afternoon; whether he had had any quarrel on\nhis own account, or interfered in any other; whether he had been in any\nsuspicious house.  The lackey, who fancied his master in imminent\ndanger, and thought he ought not to have any reserve in such an\nemergency, disclosed at once all that he knew of his connection with\nManon, and of the expense he had gone to on her account; the manner in\nwhich he had passed the afternoon with her until about nine o'clock,\nthe circumstance of his leaving her, and the outrage he encountered on\nhis return. This was enough to convince him that his son's affair was a\nlove quarrel.  Although it was then at least half-past ten at night, he\ndetermined at once to call on the lieutenant of police.  He begged of\nhim to issue immediate orders to all the detachments that were out on\nduty, and he himself, taking some men with him, hastened to the street\nwhere his son had been stopped: he visited every place where he thought\nhe might have a chance of finding him; and not being able to discover\nthe slightest trace of him, he went off to the house of his mistress,\nto which he thought he probably might by this time have returned.\n\n\"I was stepping into bed when he arrived.  The door of the chamber\nbeing closed, I did not hear the knock at the gate, but he rushed into\nthe house, accompanied by two archers of the guard, and after fruitless\nenquiries of the servants about his son, he resolved to try whether he\ncould get any information from their mistress.  He came up to the\napartment, still accompanied by the guard.  We were just on the point\nof lying down when he burst open the door, and electrified us by his\nappearance. 'Heavens!' said I to Manon, 'it is old G---- M----.'  I\nattempted to get possession of my sword; but it was fortunately\nentangled in my belt.  The archers, who saw my object, advanced to lay\nhold of me.  Stript to my shirt, I could, of course, offer no\nresistance, and they speedily deprived me of all means of defence.\n\n\"G---- M----, although a good deal embarrassed by the whole scene, soon\nrecognised me; and Manon still more easily.  'Is this a dream?' said\nhe, in the most serious tone--'do I not see before me the Chevalier des\nGrieux and Manon Lescaut?'  I was so overcome with shame and\ndisappointment, that I could make him no reply.  He appeared for some\nminutes revolving different thoughts in his mind; and as if they had\nsuddenly excited his anger, he exclaimed, addressing himself to me:\n'Wretch!  I am confident that you have murdered my son!'\n\n\"I felt indignant at so insulting a charge.  'You hoary and lecherous\nvillain!' I exclaimed, 'if I had been inclined to kill any of your\nworthless family, it is with you I should most assuredly have\ncommenced.'\n\n\"'Hold him fast,' cried he to the archers; 'he must give me some\ntidings of my son; I shall have him hanged tomorrow, if he does not\npresently let me know how he has disposed of him.'\n\n\"'You will have me hanged,' said I, 'will you?  Infamous scoundrel! it\nis for such as you that the gibbet is erected.  Know that the blood\nwhich flows in my veins is noble, and purer in every sense than yours.\nYes,' I added, 'I do know what has happened to your son; and if you\nirritate me further, I will have him strangled before morning; and I\npromise you the consolation of meeting in your own person the same\nfate, after he is disposed of.'\n\n\"I was imprudent in acknowledging that I knew where his son was, but\nexcess of anger made me commit this indiscretion.  He immediately\ncalled in five or six other archers, who were waiting at the gate, and\nordered them to take all the servants into custody.  'Ah! ah!\nChevalier,' said he, in a tone of sardonic raillery,--'so you do know\nwhere my son is, and you will have him strangled, you say?  We will try\nto set that matter to rights.'\n\n\"I now saw the folly I had committed.\n\n\"He approached Manon, who was sitting upon the bed, bathed in a flood\nof tears.  He said something, with the most cruel irony, of the\ndespotic power she wielded over old and young, father and son--her\nedifying dominion over her empire.  This superannuated monster of\nincontinence actually attempted to take liberties with her.\n\n\"'Take care,' exclaimed I, 'how you lay a finger upon her!--neither\ndivine nor human law will be able, should your folly arouse it, to\nshield you from my vengeance!'\n\n\"He quitted the room, desiring the archers to make us dress as quickly\nas possible.\n\n\"I know not what were his intentions at that moment with regard to us;\nwe might perhaps have regained our liberty if we had told him where his\nson was.  As I dressed, I considered whether this would not be the\nwisest course.  But if, on quitting the room, such had been the\ndisposition of his mind, it was very different when he returned.  He\nhad first gone to question Manon's servants, who were in the custody of\nthe guard.  From those who had been expressly hired for her service by\nhis son, he could learn nothing; but when he found that Marcel had been\npreviously our servant, he determined to extract some information from\nhim, by means of intimidation, threats, or bribes.\n\n\"This lad was faithful, but weak and unsophisticated.  The remembrance\nof what he had done at the penitentiary for Manon's release, joined to\nthe terror with which G---- M---- now inspired him, so subdued his\nmind, that he thought they were about leading him to the gallows, or\nthe rack.  He promised that, if they would spare his life, he would\ndisclose everything he knew.  This speech made G---- M---- imagine that\nthere was something more serious in the affair than he had before\nsupposed; he not only gave Marcel a promise of his life, but a handsome\nreward in hand for his intended confession.\n\n\"The booby then told him the leading features of our plot, of which we\nhad made no secret before him, as he was himself to have borne a part\nin it.  True, he knew nothing of the alterations we had made at Paris\nin our original design; but he had been informed, before quitting\nChaillot, of our projected adventure, and of the part he was to\nperform.  He therefore told him that the object was to make a dupe of\nhis son; and that Manon was to receive, if she had not already\nreceived, ten thousand francs, which, according to our project, would\nbe effectually lost to G---- M----, his heirs and assigns for ever.\n\n\"Having acquired this information, the old gentleman hastened back in a\nrage to the apartment.  Without uttering a word, he passed into the\nboudoir, where he easily put his hand upon the money and the jewels.\nHe then accosted us, bursting with rage; and holding up what he was\npleased to call our plunder, he loaded us with the most indignant\nreproaches.  He placed close to Manon's eye the pearl necklace and\nbracelets.  'Do you recognise them?' said he, in a tone of mockery; 'it\nis not, perhaps, the first time you may have seen them.  The identical\npearls, by my faith!  They were selected by your own exquisite taste!\nThe poor innocents!' added he; 'they really are most amiable creatures,\nboth one and the other; but they are perhaps a little too much inclined\nto roguery.'\n\n\"I could hardly contain my indignation at this speech.  I would have\ngiven for one moment's liberty--Heavens! what would I not have given?\nAt length, I suppressed my feelings sufficiently to say in a tone of\nmoderation, which was but the refinement of rage:  'Put an end, sir, to\nthis insolent mockery!  What is your object?  What do you purpose doing\nwith us?'\n\n\"'M. Chevalier,' he answered, 'my object is to see you quietly lodged\nin the prison of Le Chatelet.  Tomorrow will bring daylight with it,\nand we shall then be able to take a clearer view of matters; and I hope\nyou will at last do me the favour to let me know where my son is.'\n\n\"It did not require much consideration to feel convinced that our\nincarceration in Le Chatelet would be a serious calamity.  I foresaw\nall the dangers that would ensue.  In spite of my pride, I plainly saw\nthe necessity of bending before my fate, and conciliating my most\nimplacable enemy by submission.  I begged of him, in the quietest\nmanner, to listen to me.  'I wish to do myself but common justice,\nsir,' said I to him; 'I admit that my youth has led me into egregious\nfollies; and that you have had fair reason to complain: but if you have\never felt the resistless power of love, if you can enter into the\nsufferings of an unhappy young man, from whom all that he most loved\nwas ravished, you may think me perhaps not so culpable in seeking the\ngratification of an innocent revenge; or at least, you may consider me\nsufficiently punished, by the exposure and degradation I have just now\nendured.  Neither pains nor imprisonment will be requisite to make me\ntell you where your son now is.  He is in perfect safety.  It was never\nmy intention to injure him, nor to give you just cause for offence.  I\nam ready to let you know the place where he is safely passing the\nnight, if, in return, you will set us at liberty.'\n\n\"The old tiger, far from being softened by my prayer, turned his back\nupon me and laughed.  A few words escaped him, which showed that he\nperfectly well knew our whole plan from the commencement. As for his\nson, the brute said that he would easily find him, since I had not\nassassinated him.  'Conduct them to the Petit-Chatelet,' said he to the\narchers; 'and take especial care that the chevalier does not escape\nyou: he is a scamp that once before escaped from St. Lazare.'\n\n\"He went out, and left me in a condition that you may picture to\nyourself.  'O Heavens!' cried I to myself, 'I receive with humble\nsubmission all your visitations; but that a wretched scoundrel should\nthus have the power to tyrannise over me! this it is that plunges me\ninto the depths of despair!'  The archers begged that we would not\ndetain them any longer.  They had a coach at the door.  'Come, my dear\nangel,' said I to Manon, as we went down, 'come, let us submit to our\ndestiny in all its rigour: it may one day please Heaven to render us\nmore happy.'\n\n\"We went in the same coach.  I supported her in my arms.  I had not\nheard her utter a single word since G---- M----'s first appearance: but\nnow, finding herself alone with me, she addressed me in the tenderest\nmanner, and accused herself of being the cause of all my troubles.  I\nassured her that I never could complain, while she continued to love\nme.  'It is not I that have reason to complain,' I added; 'imprisonment\nfor a few months has no terrors for me, and I would infinitely prefer\nLe Chatelet to St. Lazare; but it is for you, my dearest soul, that my\nheart bleeds.  What a lot for such an angel!  How can you, gracious\nHeaven! subject to such rigour the most perfect work of your own hands?\nWhy are we not both of us born with qualities conformable to our\nwretched condition?  We are endowed with spirit, with taste, with\nfeeling; while the vilest of God's creatures--brutes, alone worthy of\nour unhappy fate, are revelling in all the favours of fortune.'\n\n\"These feelings filled me with grief; but it was bliss compared with my\nprospects for the future.  My fear, on account of Manon, knew no\nbounds.  She had already been an inmate of the Magdalen; and even if\nshe had left it by fair means, I knew that a relapse of this nature\nwould be attended with disastrous consequences.  I wished to let her\nknow my fears: I was apprehensive of exciting hers.  I trembled for\nher, without daring to put her on her guard against the danger; and I\nembraced her tenderly, to satisfy her, at least, of my love, which was\nalmost the only sentiment to which I dared to give expression.\n'Manon,' said I, 'tell me sincerely, will you ever cease to love me?'\n\n\"She answered, that it made her unhappy to think that I could doubt it.\n\n\"'Very well,' replied I, 'I do so no longer; and with this conviction,\nI may well defy all my enemies.  Through the influence of my family, I\ncan ensure my own liberation from the Chatelet; and my life will be of\nlittle use, and of short duration, if I do not succeed in rescuing you.'\n\n\"We arrived at the prison, where they put us into separate cells.  This\nblow was the less severe, because I was prepared for it.  I recommended\nManon to the attention of the porter, telling him that I was a person\nof some distinction, and promising him a considerable recompense.  I\nembraced my dearest mistress before we parted; I implored her not to\ndistress herself too much, and to fear nothing while I lived.  I had\nmoney with me: I gave her some; and I paid the porter, out of what\nremained, the amount of a month's expenses for both of us in, advance.\nThis had an excellent effect, for I found myself placed in an apartment\ncomfortably furnished, and they assured me that Manon was in one\nequally good.\n\n\"I immediately set about devising the means of procuring my liberty.\nThere certainly had been nothing actually criminal in my conduct; and\nsupposing even that our felonious intention was established by the\nevidence of Marcel, I knew that criminal intentions alone were not\npunishable.  I resolved to write immediately to my father, and beg of\nhim to come himself to Paris.  I felt much less humiliation, as I have\nalready said, in being in Le Chatelet than in St. Lazare.  Besides,\nalthough I preserved all proper respect for the paternal authority,\nage and experience had considerably lessened my timidity.  I wrote, and\nthey made no difficulty in the prison about forwarding my letter; but\nit was a trouble I should have spared myself, had I known that my\nfather was about to arrive on the following day in Paris. He had\nreceived the letter I had written to him a week before; it gave him\nextreme delight; but, notwithstanding the flattering hopes I had held\nout of my conversion, he could not implicitly rely on my statements.\nHe determined therefore to satisfy himself of my reformation by the\nevidence of his own senses, and to regulate his conduct towards me\naccording to his conviction of my sincerity.  He arrived the day after\nmy imprisonment.\n\n\"His first visit was to Tiberge, to whose care I begged that he would\naddress his answer.  He could not learn from him either my present\nabode or condition: Tiberge merely told him of my principal adventures\nsince I had escaped from St. Lazare. Tiberge spoke warmly of the\ndisposition to virtue which I had evinced at our last interview.  He\nadded, that he considered me as having quite got rid of Manon; but that\nhe was nevertheless surprised at my not having given him any\nintelligence about myself for a week.  My father was not to be duped.\nHe fully comprehended that there was something in the silence of which\nTiberge complained, which had escaped my poor friend's penetration; and\nhe took such pains to find me out, that in two days after his arrival\nhe learned that I was in Le Chatelet.\n\n\"Before I received this visit, which I little expected so soon, I had\nthe honour of one from the lieutenant-general of police, or, to call\nthings by their right names, I was subjected to an official\nexamination.  He upbraided me certainly, but not in any harsh or\nannoying manner.  He told me, in the kindest tone, that he bitterly\nlamented my bad conduct; that I had committed a gross indiscretion in\nmaking an enemy of such a man as M. G---- M----; that in truth it was\neasy to see that there was, in the affair, more of imprudence and folly\nthan of malice; but that still it was the second time I had been\nbrought as a culprit under his cognisance; and that he had hoped I\nshould have become more sedate, after the experience of two or three\nmonths in St. Lazare.\n\n\"Delighted at finding that I had a rational judge to deal with, I\nexplained the affair to him in a manner at once so respectful and so\nmoderate, that he seemed exceedingly satisfied with my answers to all\nthe queries he put.  He desired me not to abandon myself to grief, and\nassured me that he felt every disposition to serve me, as well on\naccount of my birth as my inexperience.  I ventured to bespeak his\nattentions in favour of Manon, and I dwelt upon her gentle and\nexcellent disposition.  He replied, with a smile, that he had not yet\nseen her, but that she had been represented to him as a most dangerous\nperson.  This expression so excited my sympathy, that I urged a\nthousand anxious arguments in favour of my poor mistress, and I could\nnot restrain even from shedding tears.\n\n\"He desired them to conduct me back to my chamber.  'Love! love!' cried\nthis grave magistrate as I went out, 'thou art never to be reconciled\nwith discretion!'\n\n\"I had been occupied with the most melancholy reflections, and was\nthinking of the conversation I had had with the lieutenant-general of\npolice, when I heard my door open.  It was my father.  Although I ought\nto have been half prepared for seeing him, and had reasons to expect\nhis arrival within a day or two, yet I was so thunderstruck, that I\ncould willingly have sunk into the earth, if it had been open at my\nfeet.  I embraced him in the greatest possible state of confusion.  He\ntook a seat, without either one or other of us having uttered a word.\n\n\"As I remained standing, with my head uncovered, and my eyes cast on\nthe ground, 'Be seated, sir,' said he in a solemn voice; 'be seated.  I\nhave to thank the notoriety of your debaucheries for learning the place\nof your abode.  It is the privilege of such fame as yours, that it\ncannot lie concealed.  You are acquiring celebrity by an unerring path.\nDoubtless it will lead you to the Greve,[1] and you will then have the\nunfading glory of being held up to the admiration of the world.'\n\n\"I made no reply.  He continued:  'What an unhappy lot is that of a\nfather, who having tenderly loved a child, and strained every nerve to\nbring him up a virtuous and respectable man, finds him turn out in the\nend a worthless profligate, who dishonours him.  To an ordinary reverse\nof fortune one may be reconciled; time softens the affliction, and even\nthe indulgence of sorrow itself is not unavailing; but what remedy is\nthere for an evil that is perpetually augmenting, such as the\nprofligacy of a vicious son, who has deserted every principle of\nhonour, and is ever plunging from deep into deeper vice?  You are\nsilent,' added he: 'look at this counterfeit modesty, this hypocritical\nair of gentleness!-- might he not pass for the most respectable member\nof his family?'\n\n\"Although I could not but feel that I deserved, in some degree, these\nreproaches, yet he appeared to me to carry them beyond all reason.  I\nthought I might be permitted to explain my feelings.\n\n\"'I assure you, sir,' said I to him, 'that the modesty which you\nridicule is by no means affected; it is the natural feeling of a son\nwho entertains sincere respect for his father, and above all, a father\nirritated as you justly are by his faults.  Neither have I, sir, the\nslightest wish to pass for the most respectable member of my family.  I\nknow that I have merited your reproaches, but I conjure you to temper\nthem with mercy, and not to look upon me as the most infamous of\nmankind.  I do not deserve such harsh names.  It is love, you know it,\nthat has caused all my errors. Fatal passion!  Have you yourself never\nfelt its force?  Is it possible that you, with the same blood in your\nveins that flows in mine, should have passed through life unscathed by\nthe same excitements?  Love has rendered me perhaps foolishly\ntender--too easily excited--too impassioned--too faithful, and\nprobably too indulgent to the desires and caprices, or, if you will,\nthe faults of an adored mistress.  These are my crimes; are they such\nas to reflect dishonour upon you?  Come, my dear father,' said I\ntenderly, 'show some pity for a son, who has never ceased to feel\nrespect and affection for you--who has not renounced, as you say, all\nfeelings of honour and of duty, and who is himself a thousand times\nmore an object of pity than you imagine.'  I could not help shedding a\ntear as I concluded this appeal.\n\n\"A father's heart is a chef-d'oeuvre of creation.  There nature rules\nin undisturbed dominion, and regulates at will its most secret springs.\nHe was a man of high feeling and good taste, and was so sensibly\naffected by the turn I had given to my defence, that he could no longer\nhide from me the change I had wrought.\n\n\"'Come to me, my poor chevalier,' said he; 'come and embrace me.  I do\npity you!'\n\n\"I embraced him: he pressed me to him in such a manner, that I guessed\nwhat was passing in his heart.\n\n\"'But how are we,' said he, 'to extricate you from this place? Explain\nto me the real situation of your affairs.'\n\n\"As there really was not anything in my conduct so grossly improper as\nto reflect dishonour upon me; at least, in comparison with the conduct\nof other young men of a certain station in the world; and as a mistress\nis not considered a disgrace, any more than a little dexterity in\ndrawing some advantage from play, I gave my father a candid detail of\nthe life I had been leading. As I recounted each transgression, I took\ncare to cite some illustrious example in my justification, in order to\npalliate my own faults.\n\n\"'I lived,' said I, 'with a mistress without the solemnity of marriage.\nThe Duke of ---- keeps two before the eyes of all Paris.  M---- D----\nhas had one now for ten years, and loves her with a fidelity which he\nhas never shown to his wife.  Two-thirds of the men of fashion in Paris\nkeep mistresses.\n\n\"'I certainly have on one or two occasions cheated at play. Well, the\nMarquis of ---- and the Count ---- have no other source of revenue.\nThe Prince of ---- and the Duke of ---- are at the head of a gang of\nthe same industrious order.'  As for the designs I had upon the pockets\nof the two G---- M----s, I might just as easily have proved that I had\nabundant models for that also; but I had too much pride to plead guilty\nto this charge, and rest on the justification of example; so that I\nbegged of my father to ascribe my weakness on this occasion to the\nviolence of the two passions which agitated me--Revenge and Love.\n\n\"He asked me whether I could suggest any means of obtaining my liberty,\nand in such a way as to avoid publicity as much as possible.  I told\nhim of the kind feelings which the lieutenant-general of police had\nexpressed towards me.  'If you encounter any obstacles,' said I, 'they\nwill be offered only by the two G---- M----s; so that I think it would\nbe advisable to call upon them.'\n\n\"He promised to do so.\n\n\"I did not dare ask him to solicit Manon's liberation; this was not\nfrom want of courage, but from the apprehension of exasperating him by\nsuch a proposition, and perhaps driving him to form some design fatal\nto the future happiness of us both.  It remains to this hour a problem\nwhether this fear on my part was not the immediate cause of all my most\nterrible misfortunes, by preventing me from ascertaining my father's\ndisposition, and endeavouring to inspire him with favourable feelings\ntowards my poor mistress: I might have perhaps once more succeeded in\nexciting his commiseration; I might have put him on his guard against\nthe impression which he was sure of receiving from a visit to old G----\nM----.  But how can I tell what the consequences would have been!  My\nunhappy fate would have most probably counteracted all my efforts; but\nit would have been a consolation to have had nothing else but that, and\nthe cruelty of my enemies, to blame for my afflictions.\n\n\"On quitting me, my father went to pay a visit to M. G---- M----.  He\nfound him with his son, whom the guardsman had safely restored to\nliberty.  I never learned the particulars of their conversation; but I\ncould easily infer them from the disastrous results.  They went\ntogether (the two old gentlemen) to the lieutenant-general of police,\nfrom whom they requested one favour each: the first was to have me at\nonce liberated from Le Chatelet; the second to condemn Manon to\nperpetual imprisonment, or to transport her for life to America.  They\nhappened, at that very period, to be sending out a number of convicts\nto the Mississippi.  The lieutenant-general promised to have her\nembarked on board the first vessel that sailed.\n\n\"M. G---- M---- and my father came together to bring me the news of my\nliberation.  M. G---- M---- said something civil with reference to what\nhad passed; and having congratulated me upon my happiness in having\nsuch a father, he exhorted me to profit henceforward by his instruction\nand example.  My father desired me to express my sorrow for the\ninjustice I had even contemplated against his family, and my gratitude\nfor his having assisted in procuring my liberation.\n\n\"We all left the prison together, without the mention of Manon's name.\nI dared not in their presence speak of her to the turnkeys.  Alas! all\nmy entreaties in her favour would have been useless.  The cruel\nsentence upon Manon had arrived at the same time as the warrant for my\ndischarge.  The unfortunate girl was conducted in an hour after to the\nHospital, to be there classed with some other wretched women, who had\nbeen condemned to the same punishment.\n\n\"My father having forced me to accompany him to the house where he was\nresiding, it was near six o'clock before I had an opportunity of\nescaping his vigilance.  In returning to Le Chatelet, my only wish was\nto convey some refreshments to Manon, and to recommend her to the\nattention of the porter; for I had no hope of being permitted to see\nher; nor had I, as yet, had time to reflect on the best means of\nrescuing her.\n\n\"I asked for the porter.  I had won his heart, as much by my liberality\nto him, as by the mildness of my manner; so that, having a disposition\nto serve me, he spoke of Manon's sentence as a calamity which he\nsincerely regretted, since it was calculated to mortify me.  I was at\nfirst unable to comprehend his meaning. We conversed for some minutes\nwithout my understanding him.  At length perceiving that an explanation\nwas necessary, he gave me such a one, as on a former occasion I wanted\ncourage to relate to you, and which, even now, makes my blood curdle in\nmy veins to remember.\"\n\n\n[1] Who has e'er been at Paris must needs know the Greve,\n    The fatal retreat of th' unfortunate brave,\n    Where honour and justice most oddly contribute,\n    To ease heroes' pains by the halter and gibbet.--PRIOR.\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\nAlack! it is not when we sleep soft and wake merrily that we think on\nother people's sufferings; but when the hour of trouble comes, said\nJeanie Deans.--WALTER SCOTT.\n\n\n\"Never did apoplexy produce on mortal a more sudden or terrific effect\nthan did the announcement of Manon's sentence upon me.  I fell\nprostrate, with so intense a palpitation of the heart, that as I\nswooned I thought that death itself was come upon me.  This idea\ncontinued even after I had been restored to my senses.  I gazed around\nme upon every part of the room, then upon my own paralysed limbs,\ndoubting, in my delirium, whether I still bore about me the attributes\nof a living man.  It is quite certain that, in obedience to the desire\nI felt of terminating my sufferings, even by my own hand, nothing could\nhave been to me more welcome than death at that moment of anguish and\ndespair. Religion itself could depict nothing more insupportable after\ndeath than the racking agony with which I was then convulsed. Yet, by a\nmiracle, only within the power of omnipotent love, I soon regained\nstrength enough to express my gratitude to Heaven for restoring me to\nsense and reason.  My death could have only been a relief and blessing\nto myself; whereas Manon had occasion for my prolonged existence, in\norder to deliver her--to succour her--to avenge her wrongs: I swore to\ndevote that existence unremittingly to these objects.\n\n\"The porter gave me every assistance that I could have expected at the\nhands of my oldest friend: I accepted his services with the liveliest\ngratitude.  'Alas!' said I to him, 'you then are affected by my\nsufferings!  The whole world abandons me; my own father proves one of\nthe very cruellest of my persecutors; no person feels pity for me!  You\nalone, in this abode of suffering and shame--you alone exhibit\ncompassion for the most wretched of mankind!'  He advised me not to\nappear in the street until I had recovered a little from my affliction.\n'Do not stop me,' said I, as I went out; 'we shall meet again sooner\nthan you imagine: get ready your darkest dungeon, for I shall shortly\nbecome its tenant.'\n\n\"In fact, my first idea was nothing less than to make away with the two\nG---- M----s, and the lieutenant-general of police; and then to attack\nthe Hospital, sword in hand, assisted by all whom I could enlist in my\ncause.  Even my father's life was hardly respected, so just appeared my\nfeelings of vengeance; for the porter had informed me that he and G----\nM---- were jointly the authors of my ruin.\n\n\"But when I had advanced some paces into the street, and the fresh air\nhad cooled my excitement, I gradually viewed matters in a more rational\nmood.  The death of our enemies could be of little use to Manon; and\nthe obvious effect of such violence would be to deprive me of all other\nchance of serving her. Besides, could I ever bring myself to be a\ncowardly assassin?  By what other means could I accomplish my revenge?\nI set all my ingenuity and all my efforts at work to procure the\ndeliverance of Manon, leaving everything else to be considered\nhereafter when I had succeeded in this first and paramount object.\n\n\"I had very little money left; money, however, was an indispensable\nbasis for all my operations.  I only knew three persons from whom I had\nany right to ask pecuniary assistance--M. de T----, Tiberge, and my\nfather.  There appeared little chance of obtaining any from the two\nlatter, and I was really ashamed again to importune M. de T----.  But\nit is not in desperate emergencies that one stands upon points of\nceremony.  I went first to the seminary of St. Sulpice, without\nconsidering whether I should be recognised.  I asked for Tiberge.  His\nfirst words showed me that he knew nothing of my latest adventure: this\nmade me change the design I had originally formed of appealing at once\nto his compassion.  I spoke generally of the pleasure it had given me\nto see my father again; and I then begged of him to lend me some money,\nunder the pretext of being anxious before I left Paris to pay a few\nlittle debts, which I wished to keep secret. He handed me his purse,\nwithout a single remark.  I took twenty or twenty-five pounds, which it\ncontained.  I offered him my note of hand, but he was too generous to\naccept it.\n\n\"I then went to M. de T----: I had no reserve with him.  I plainly told\nhim my misfortunes and distress: he already knew everything, and had\ninformed himself even of the most trifling circumstance, on account of\nthe interest he naturally took in young G---- M----'s adventure.  He,\nhowever, listened to me, and seemed sincerely to lament what had\noccurred.  When I consulted him as to the best means of rescuing Manon,\nhe answered that he saw such little ground for hope, that, without some\nextraordinary interposition of Providence, it would be folly to expect\nrelief; that he had paid a visit expressly to the Hospital since Manon\nhad been transferred from the Chatelet, but that he could not even\nobtain permission to see her, as the lieutenant-general of police had\ngiven the strictest orders to the contrary; and that, to complete the\ncatastrophe, the unfortunate train of convicts, in which she was to be\nincluded, was to take its departure from Paris the day but one after.\n\n\"I was so confounded by what he said, that if he had gone on speaking\nfor another hour, I should not have interrupted him.  He continued to\ntell me, that the reason of his not calling to see me at the Chatelet\nwas, that he hoped to be of more use by appearing to be unknown to me;\nthat for the last few hours, since I had been set at liberty, he had in\nvain looked for me, in order to suggest the only plan through which he\ncould see a hope of averting Manon's fate.  He told me it was dangerous\ncounsel to give, and implored me never to mention the part he took in\nit; it was to find some enterprising fellows gallant enough to attack\nManon's guard on getting outside the barriere.  Nor did he wait for me\nto urge a plea of poverty.  'Here is fifty pounds,' he said, presenting\nme his purse; 'it may be of use to you; you can repay me when you are\nin better circumstances.'  He added, that if the fear of losing his\ncharacter did not prevent him from embarking in such an enterprise, he\nwould have willingly put his sword and his life at my service.\n\n\"This unlooked-for generosity affected me to tears.  I expressed my\ngratitude with as much warmth as my depressed spirits left at my\ncommand.  I asked him if there were nothing to be expected from\ninterceding with the lieutenant-general of police: he said that he had\nconsidered that point; but that he looked upon it as a hopeless\nattempt, because a favour of that nature was never accorded without\nsome strong motive, and he did not see what inducement could be held\nout for engaging the intercession of any person of power on her behalf;\nthat if any hope could possibly be entertained upon the point, it must\nbe by working a change in the feelings of old G---- M---- and my\nfather, and by prevailing on them to solicit from the\nlieutenant-general of police the revocation of Manon's sentence.  He\noffered to do everything in his power to gain over the younger G----\nM----, although he fancied a coldness in that gentleman's manner\ntowards him, probably from some suspicions he might entertain of his\nbeing concerned in the late affair; and he entreated me to lose no\nopportunity of effecting the desired change in my father's mind.\n\n\"This was no easy undertaking for me; not only on account of the\ndifficulty I should naturally meet in overcoming his opinion, but for\nanother reason which made me fear even to approach him; I had quitted\nhis lodgings contrary to his express orders, and was resolved, since I\nhad learned the sad fate of my poor Manon, never again to return\nthither.  I was not without apprehensions indeed of his now retaining\nme against my will, and perhaps taking me at once back with him into\nthe country.  My elder brother had formerly had recourse to this\nviolent measure.  True, I was now somewhat older; but age is a feeble\nargument against force.  I hit upon a mode, however, of avoiding this\ndanger, which was to get him by contrivance to some public place, and\nthere announce myself to him under an assumed name: I immediately\nresolved on this method.  M. de T---- went to G---- M----'s, and I to\nthe Luxembourg, whence I sent my father word, that a gentleman waited\nthere to speak with him.  I hardly thought he would come, as the night\nwas advancing.  He, however, soon made his appearance, followed by a\nservant: I begged of him to choose a walk where we could be alone.  We\nwalked at least a hundred paces without speaking.  He doubtless\nimagined that so much precaution could not be taken without some\nimportant object.  He waited for my opening speech, and I was\nmeditating how to commence it.\n\n\"At length I began.\n\n\"'Sir,' said I, trembling, 'you are a good and affectionate parent; you\nhave loaded me with favours, and have forgiven me an infinite number of\nfaults; I also, in my turn, call Heaven to witness the sincere, and\ntender, and respectful sentiments I entertain towards you.  But it does\nseem to me, that your inexorable severity----'\n\n\"'Well, sir, my severity!' interrupted my father, who no doubt found my\nhesitation little suited to his impatience.\n\n\"'Ah, sir,' I replied, 'it does seem to me that your severity is\nexcessive in the penalty you inflict upon the unfortunate Manon.  You\nhave taken only M. G---- M----'s report of her.  His hatred has made\nhim represent her to you in the most odious colours: you have formed a\nfrightful idea of her.  She is, on the contrary, the mildest and most\namiable of living creatures; would that Heaven had but inspired you at\nany one moment with the desire of seeing her!  I am convinced that you\nwould be not less sensible of her perfections than your unhappy son.\nYou would then have been her advocate; you would have abhorred the foul\nartifices of G---- M----; you would have had pity on both her and me.\nAlas! I am persuaded of it; your heart is not insensible; it must ere\nnow have melted with compassion.'\n\n\"He interrupted me again, perceiving that I spoke with a warmth which\nwould not allow me to finish very briefly.  He begged to know with what\nrequest I intended to wind up so fervent an harangue.\n\n\"'To ask my life at your hands,' said I, 'which I never can retain if\nManon once embark for America.'\n\n\"'No! no!' replied he, in the severest tone; 'I would rather see you\nlifeless, than infamous and depraved.'\n\n\"'We have gone far enough, then,' said I, catching hold of his arm;\n'take from me, in common mercy, my life! weary and odious and\ninsupportable as it henceforward must be; for in the state of despair\ninto which you now plunge me, death would be the greatest favour you\ncould bestow--a favour worthy of a father's hand.'\n\n\"'I should only give you what you deserve,' replied he; 'I know fathers\nwho would not have shown as much patience as I have, but would\nthemselves have executed speedy justice; but it is my foolish and\nexcessive forbearance that has been your ruin.'\n\n\"I threw myself at his feet:  'Ah!' exclaimed I, 'if you have still any\nremains of mercy, do not harden your heart against my distress and\nsorrow.  Remember that I am your child!  Alas! think of my poor mother!\nyou loved her tenderly! would you have suffered her to be torn from\nyour arms?  You would have defended her to the death!  May not the same\nfeeling then be pardoned in others?  Can persons become barbarous and\ncruel, after having themselves experienced the softening influence of\ntenderness and grief?'\n\n\"'Breathe not again the sacred name of your mother,' he exclaimed, in a\nvoice of thunder; 'the very allusion to her memory rouses my\nindignation.  Had she lived to witness the unredeemed profligacy of\nyour life, it would have brought her in pain and sorrow to her\ngrave.--Let us put an end to this discussion' he added; 'it distresses\nme, and makes not the slightest change in my determination: I am going\nback to my lodgings, and I desire you to follow me.'\n\n\"The cool and resolute tone in which he uttered this command, convinced\nme that he was inexorable.  I stepped some paces aside, for fear he\nshould think fit to lay hands upon me.\n\n\"'Do not increase my misery and despair,' said I to him, 'by forcing me\nto disobey you.  It is impossible for me to follow you; and equally so\nthat I should continue to live, after the unkind treatment I have\nexperienced from you.  I, therefore, bid you an eternal adieu.  When\nyou know that I am dead, as I shall soon be, the paternal affection\nwhich you once entertained for me may be perhaps revived.'\n\n\"As I was about to turn away from him:  'You refuse then to follow me,'\ncried he, in a tone of excessive anger.  'Go! go on to your ruin.\nAdieu! ungrateful and disobedient boy.'\n\n\"'Adieu!' exclaimed I to him, in a burst of grief, 'adieu, cruel and\nunnatural father!'\n\n\"I left the Luxembourg, and rushed like a madman through the streets to\nM. de T----'s house.  I raised my hands and eyes as I went along,\ninvoking the Almighty Powers:  'O Heaven,' cried I, 'will you not prove\nmore merciful than man!  The only hope that remains to me is from\nabove!'\n\n\"M. de T---- had not yet returned home; but he arrived before many\nminutes had elapsed.  His negotiation had been as unsuccessful as my\nown.  He told me so with the most sorrowful countenance.  Young G----\nM----, although less irritated than his father against Manon and me,\nwould not undertake to petition in our favour.  He was, in great\nmeasure, deterred by the fear which he himself had of the vindictive\nold lecher, who had already vented his anger against him for his design\nof forming a connection with Manon.\n\n\"There only remained to me, therefore, the violent measures which M.\nT---- had suggested.  I now confined all my hopes to them.  They were\nquestionless most uncertain; but they held out to me, at least, a\nsubstantial consolation, in the certainty of meeting death in the\nattempt, if unsuccessful.  I left him, begging that he would offer up\nhis best wishes for my triumph; and I thought only of finding some\ncompanions, to whom I might communicate a portion of my own courage and\ndetermination.\n\n\"The first that occurred to me was the same guardsman whom I had\nemployed to arrest G---- M----.  I had intended indeed to pass the\nnight at his rooms, not having had a moment of leisure during the\nafternoon to procure myself a lodging.  I found him alone. He was glad\nto see me out of the Chatelet.  He made me an offer of his services.  I\nexplained to him in what way he might now do me the greatest kindness.\nHe had good sense enough to perceive all the difficulties; but he was\nalso generous enough to undertake to surmount them.\n\n\"We spent part of the night in considering how the plot was to be\nexecuted.  He spoke of the three soldiers whom he had made use of on\nthe last occasion, as men whose courage had been proved. M. de T----\nhad told me the exact number of archers that would escort Manon; they\nwere but six.  Five strong and determined men could not fail to strike\nterror into these fellows, who would never think of defending\nthemselves bravely, when they were to be allowed the alternative of\navoiding danger by surrendering; and of that they would no doubt avail\nthemselves.  As I was not without money, the guardsman advised me to\nspare no pains or expense to ensure success.  'We must be mounted,' he\nsaid, 'and each man must have his carbine and pistols; I will take care\nto prepare everything requisite by tomorrow.  We shall also want three\nnew suits of regimentals for the soldiers, who dare not appear in an\naffray of this kind in the uniform of their regiment.  I handed him the\nhundred pistoles which I had got from M. de T----; it was all expended\nthe next morning, to the very last sou.  I inspected the three\nsoldiers; I animated them with the most liberal promises; and to\nconfirm their confidence in me, I began by making each man a present of\nten pistoles.\n\n\"The momentous day having arrived, I sent one of them at an early hour\nto the Hospital, to ascertain the exact time when the police were to\nstart with their prisoners.  Although I merely took this precaution\nfrom my excessive anxiety, it turned out to have been a prudent step.\nI had formed my plans upon false information, which I had received as\nto their destination; and believing that it was at Rochelle this\nunhappy group was to embark, all my trouble would have been thrown away\nin waiting for them on the Orleans road.  However, I learned, by the\nsoldier's report, that they would go out towards Rouen, and that it was\nfrom Havre-de-Grace they were to sail for America.\n\n\"We at once went to the gate of St. Honore, taking care to go by\ndifferent streets.  We assembled at the end of the faubourg.  Our\nhorses were fresh.  In a little time we observed before us the six\narchers and the two wretched caravans, which you saw at Passy two years\nago.  The sight alone almost deprived me of my strength and senses.\n'Oh fate!' said I to myself, 'cruel fate! grant me now either death or\nvictory.'\n\n\"We hastily consulted as to the mode of making the attack.  The\ncavalcade was only four hundred paces in advance, and we might\nintercept them by cutting across a small field, round which the high\nroad led.  The guardsman was for this course, in order to fall suddenly\nupon them while unprepared.  I approved of the plan, and was the first\nto spur my horse forward--but fate once again relentlessly blasted all\nmy hopes.\n\n\"The escort, seeing five horsemen riding towards them, inferred that it\nwas for the purpose of attacking them.  They put themselves in a\nposition of defence, preparing their bayonets and guns with an air of\nresolution.\n\n\"This demonstration, which in the guardsman and myself only inspired\nfresh courage, had a very different effect upon our three cowardly\ncompanions.  They stopped simultaneously, and having muttered to each\nother some words which I could not hear, they turned their horses'\nheads, threw the bridles on their necks, and galloped back towards\nParis.\n\n\"'Good heavens!' said the guardsman, who appeared as much annoyed as I\nwas by this infamous desertion, 'what is to be done? we are but two\nnow.'\n\n\"From rage and consternation I had lost all power of speech.  I doubted\nwhether my first revenge should not be in pursuing the cowards who had\nabandoned me.  I saw them flying, and looked in the other direction at\nthe escort: if it had been possible to divide myself, I should at once\nhave fallen upon both these objects of my fury; I should have destroyed\nall at the same moment.\n\n\"The guardsman, who saw my irresolution by my wandering gaze, begged of\nme to hear his advice.  'Being but two,' he said, 'it would be madness\nto attack six men as well armed as ourselves, and who seem determined\nto receive us firmly.  Let us return to Paris, and endeavour to succeed\nbetter in the choice of our comrades.  The police cannot make very\nrapid progress with two heavy vans; we may overtake them tomorrow\nwithout difficulty.'\n\n\"I reflected a moment on this suggestion; but seeing nothing around me\nbut despair, I took a final and indeed desperate resolution: this was\nto thank my companion for his services, and, far from attacking the\npolice, to go up with submission and implore them to receive me among\nthem, that I might accompany Manon to Havre-de-Grace, and afterwards,\nif possible, cross the Atlantic with her.  'The whole world is either\npersecuting or betraying me,' said I to the guardsman; 'I have no\nlonger the power of interesting anyone in my favour; I expect nothing\nmore either from fortune or the friendship of man; my misery is at its\nheight; it only remains for me to submit, so that I close my eyes\nhenceforward against every gleam of hope.  May Heaven,' I continued,\n'reward you for your generosity!  Adieu!  I shall go and aid my\nwretched destiny in filling up the full measure of my ruin!'  He, in\nvain, endeavoured to persuade me to return with him to Paris.  I\nentreated him to leave me at once, lest the police should still suspect\nus of an intention to attack them.\"\n\n\n\nXII\n\n\nThe pauses and intermissions of pain become positive pleasures; and\nhave thus a power of shedding a satisfaction over the intervals of\nease, which few enjoyments exceed.--PALEY.\n\n\n\"Riding towards the cortege at a slow pace, and with a sorrowful\ncountenance, the guards could hardly see anything very terrific in my\napproach.  They seemed, however, to expect an attack.  'Be persuaded,\ngentlemen,' said I to them, 'that I come not to wage war, but rather to\nask favours.'  I then begged of them to continue their progress without\nany distrust, and as we went along I made my solicitations.  They\nconsulted together to ascertain in what way they should entertain my\nrequest.  The chief of them spoke for the rest.  He said that the\norders they had received to watch the prisoners vigilantly were of the\nstrictest kind; that, however, I seemed so interesting a young man,\nthat they might be induced to relax a little in their duty; but that I\nmust know, of course, that this would cost me something.  I had about\nsixteen pistoles left, and candidly told them what my purse contained.\n'Well,' said the gendarme, 'we will act generously.  It shall only cost\nyou a crown an hour for conversing with any of our girls that you may\nprefer-- that is the ordinary price in Paris.'\n\n\"I said not a word of Manon, because I did not wish to let them know of\nmy passion.  They at first supposed it was merely a boyish whim, that\nmade me think of amusing myself with these creatures: but when they\ndiscovered that I was in love, they increased their demands in such a\nway, that my purse was completely empty on leaving Mantes, where we had\nslept the night before our arrival at Passy.\n\n\"Shall I describe to you my heart-rending interviews with Manon during\nthis journey, and what my sensations were when I obtained from the\nguards permission to approach her caravan?  Oh! language never can\nadequately express the sentiments of the heart; but picture to yourself\nmy poor mistress, with a chain round her waist, seated upon a handful\nof straw, her head resting languidly against the panel of the carriage,\nher face pale and bathed with tears, which forced a passage between her\neyelids, although she kept them continually closed.  She had not even\nthe curiosity to open her eyes on hearing the bustle of the guards when\nthey expected our attack.  Her clothes were soiled, and in disorder;\nher delicate hands exposed to the rough air; in fine, her whole angelic\nform, that face, lovely enough to carry back the world to idolatry,\npresented a spectacle of distress and anguish utterly indescribable.\n\n\"I spent some moments gazing at her as I rode alongside the carriage.\nI had so lost my self-possession, that I was several times on the point\nof falling from my horse.  My sighs and frequent exclamations at length\nattracted her attention.  She looked at and recognised me, and I\nremarked that on the first impulse, she unconsciously tried to leap\nfrom the carriage towards me, but being checked by her chain, she fell\ninto her former attitude.\n\n\"I begged of the guards to stop one moment for the sake of mercy; they\nconsented for the sake of avarice.  I dismounted to go and sit near\nher.  She was so languid and feeble, that she was for some time without\nthe power of speech, and could not raise her hands: I bathed them with\nmy tears; and being myself unable to utter a word, we formed together\nas deplorable a picture of distress as could well be seen.  When at\nlength we were able to speak, our conversation was not less sorrowful.\nManon said little: shame and grief appeared to have altered the\ncharacter of her voice; its tone was feeble and tremulous.\n\n\"She thanked me for not having forgotten her, and for the comfort I\ngave her in allowing her to see me once more, and she then bade me a\nlong and last farewell.  But when I assured her that no power on earth\ncould ever separate me from her, and that I was resolved to follow her\nto the extremity of the world--to watch over her--to guard her--to love\nher--and inseparably to unite my wretched destiny with hers, the poor\ngirl gave way to such feelings of tenderness and grief, that I almost\ndreaded danger to her life from the violence of her emotion: the\nagitation of her whole soul seemed intensely concentrated in her eyes;\nshe fixed them steadfastly upon me.  She more than once opened her lips\nwithout the power of giving utterance to her thoughts.  I could,\nhowever, catch some expressions that dropped from her, of admiration\nand wonder at my excessive love--of doubt that she could have been\nfortunate enough to inspire me with a passion so perfect--of earnest\nentreaty that I would abandon my intention of following her, and seek\nelsewhere a lot more worthy of me, and which, she said, I could never\nhope to find with her.\n\n\"In spite of the cruellest inflictions of Fate, I derived comfort from\nher looks, and from the conviction that I now possessed her undivided\naffection.  I had in truth lost all that other men value; but I was the\nmaster of Manon's heart, the only possession that I prized.  Whether in\nEurope or in America, of what moment to me was the place of my abode,\nprovided I might live happy in the society of my mistress?  Is not the\nuniverse the residence of two fond and faithful lovers?  Does not each\nfind in the other, father, mother, friends, relations, riches, felicity?\n\n\"If anything caused me uneasiness, it was the fear of seeing Manon\nexposed to want.  I fancied myself already with her in a barbarous\ncountry, inhabited by savages.  'I am quite certain,' said I, 'there\nwill be none there more cruel than G---- M---- and my father.  They\nwill, at least, allow us to live in peace.  If the accounts we read of\nsavages be true, they obey the laws of nature: they neither know the\nmean rapacity of avarice, nor the false and fantastic notions of\ndignity, which have raised me up an enemy in my own father.  They will\nnot harass and persecute two lovers, when they see us adopt their own\nsimple habits.' I was therefore at ease upon that point.\n\n\"But my romantic ideas were not formed with a proper view to the\nordinary wants of life.  I had too often found that there were\nnecessaries which could not be dispensed with, particularly by a young\nand delicate woman, accustomed to comfort and abundance.  I was in\ndespair at having so fruitlessly emptied my purse, and the little money\nthat now remained was about being forced from me by the rascally\nimposition of the gendarmes.  I imagined that a very trifling sum would\nsuffice for our support for some time in America, where money was\nscarce, and might also enable me to form some undertaking there for our\npermanent establishment.\n\n\"This idea made me resolve on writing to Tiberge, whom I had ever found\nready to hold out the generous hand of friendship.  I wrote from the\nfirst town we passed through.  I only alluded to the destitute\ncondition in which I foresaw that I should find myself on arriving at\nHavre-de-Grace, to which place I acknowledged that I was accompanying\nManon.  I asked him for only fifty pistoles.  'You can remit it to me,'\nsaid I to him, 'through the hands of the postmaster.  You must perceive\nthat it is the last time I can by possibility trespass on your friendly\nkindness; and my poor unhappy mistress being about to be exiled from\nher country for ever, I cannot let her depart without supplying her\nwith some few comforts, to soften the sufferings of her lot, as well as\nto assuage my own sorrows.'\n\n\"The gendarmes became so rapacious when they saw the violence of my\npassion, continually increasing their demands for the slightest\nfavours, that they soon left me penniless.  Love did not permit me to\nput any bounds to my liberality.  At Manon's side I was not master of\nmyself; and it was no longer by the hour that time was measured; rather\nby the duration of whole days.  At length, my funds being completely\nexhausted, I found myself exposed to the brutal caprice of these six\nwretches who treated me with intolerable rudeness--you yourself\nwitnessed it at Passy. My meeting with you was a momentary relaxation\naccorded me by fate.  Your compassion at the sight of my sufferings was\nmy only recommendation to your generous nature.  The assistance which\nyou so liberally extended, enabled me to reach Havre, and the guards\nkept their promise more faithfully than I had ventured to hope.\n\n\"We arrived at Havre.  I went to the post-office: Tiberge had not yet\nhad time to answer my letter.  I ascertained the earliest day I might\nreckon upon his answer: it could not possibly arrive for two days\nlonger; and by an extraordinary fatality, our vessel was to sail on the\nvery morning of the day when the letter might be expected.  I cannot\ngive you an idea of my despair.  'Alas!' cried I, 'even amongst the\nunfortunate, I am to be ever the most wretched!'\n\n\"Manon replied:  'Alas! does a life so thoroughly miserable deserve the\ncare we bestow on ours?  Let us die at Havre, dearest chevalier!  Let\ndeath at once put an end to our afflictions! Shall we persevere, and go\nto drag on this hopeless existence in an unknown land, where we shall,\nno doubt, have to encounter the most horrible pains, since it has been\ntheir object to punish me by exile?  Let us die,' she repeated, 'or do\nat least in mercy rid me of life, and then you can seek another lot in\nthe arms of some happier lover.'\n\n\"'No, no, Manon,' said I; 'it is but too enviable a lot, in my\nestimation, to be allowed to share your misfortunes.'\n\n\"Her observations made me tremble.  I saw that she was overpowered by\nher afflictions.  I tried to assume a more tranquil air, in order to\ndissipate such melancholy thoughts of death and despair.\n\n\"I resolved to adopt the same course in future; and I learned by the\nresults, that nothing is more calculated to inspire a woman with\ncourage than the demonstration of intrepidity in the man she loves.\n\n\"When I lost all hope of receiving the expected assistance from\nTiberge, I sold my horse; the money it brought, joined to what remained\nof your generous gift, amounted to the small sum of forty pistoles; I\nexpended eight in the purchase of some necessary articles for Manon;\nand I put the remainder by, as the capital upon which we were to rest\nour hopes and raise our fortunes in America.  I had no difficulty in\ngetting admitted on board the vessel.  They were at the time looking\nfor young men as voluntary emigrants to the colony.  The passage and\nprovisions were supplied gratis.  I left a letter for Tiberge, which\nwas to go by the post next morning to Paris.  It was no doubt written\nin a tone calculated to affect him deeply, since it induced him to form\na resolution, which could only be carried into execution by the\ntenderest and most generous sympathy for his unhappy friend.\n\n\n\nXIII\n\n\n  Sunt hie etiam sua proemia laudi,\n  Sunt lachrymae rerum, et mentem mortalia tangunt.\n        VIRGIL.\n\n  E'en the mute walls relate the victim's fame.\n  And sinner's tears the good man's pity claim.\n        DRYDEN.\n\n\n\"We set sail; the wind continued favourable during the entire passage.\nI obtained from the captain's kindness a separate cabin for the use of\nManon and myself.  He was so good as to distinguish us from the herd of\nour miserable associates.  I took an opportunity, on the second day, of\nconciliating his attentions, by telling him part of our unfortunate\nhistory.  I did not feel that I was guilty of any very culpable\nfalsehood in saying that I was the husband of Manon.  He appeared to\nbelieve it, and promised me his protection; and indeed we experienced,\nduring the whole passage, the most flattering evidences of his\nsincerity.  He took care that our table was comfortably provided; and\nhis attentions procured us the marked respect of our companions in\nmisery.  The unwearied object of my solicitude was to save Manon from\nevery inconvenience.  She felt this, and her gratitude, together with a\nlively sense of the singular position in which I had placed myself\nsolely for her sake, rendered the dear creature so tender and\nimpassioned, so attentive also to my most trifling wants, that it was\nbetween us a continual emulation of attentions and of love.  I felt no\nregret at quitting Europe; on the contrary, the nearer we approached\nAmerica, the more did I feel my heart expand and become tranquil.  If I\nhad not felt a dread of our perhaps wanting, by and by, the absolute\nnecessaries of life, I should have been grateful to fate for having at\nlength given so favourable a turn to our affairs.\n\n\"'After a passage of two months, we at length reached the banks of the\ndesired river.  The country offered at first sight nothing agreeable.\nWe saw only sterile and uninhabited plains, covered with rushes, and\nsome trees rooted up by the wind.  No trace either of men or animals.\nHowever, the captain having discharged some pieces of artillery, we\npresently observed a group of the inhabitants of New Orleans, who\napproached us with evident signs of joy.  We had not perceived the\ntown: it is concealed upon the side on which we approached it by a\nhill.  We were received as persons dropped from the clouds.\n\n\"The poor inhabitants hastened to put a thousand questions to us upon\nthe state of France, and of the different provinces in which they were\nborn.  They embraced us as brothers, and as beloved companions, who had\ncome to share their pains and their solitude.\n\n\"We turned towards the town with them; but we were astonished to\nperceive, as we advanced, that what we had hitherto heard spoken of as\na respectable town, was nothing more than a collection of miserable\nhuts.  They were inhabited by five or six hundred persons.  The\ngovernor's house was a little distinguished from the rest by its height\nand its position.  It was surrounded by some earthen ramparts, and a\ndeep ditch.\n\n\"We were first presented to him.  He continued for some time in\nconversation with the captain; and then advancing towards us, he looked\nattentively at the women one after another: there were thirty of them,\nfor another troop of convicts had joined us at Havre.  After having\nthus inspected them, he sent for several young men of the colony who\nwere desirous to marry.  He assigned the handsomest women to the\nprincipal of these, and the remainder were disposed of by lot.  He had\nnot yet addressed Manon; but having ordered the others to depart, he\nmade us remain.  'I learn from the captain,' said he, 'that you are\nmarried, and he is convinced by your conduct on the passage that you\nare both persons of merit and of education.  I have nothing to do with\nthe cause of your misfortunes; but if it be true that you are as\nconversant with the world and society as your appearance would\nindicate, I shall spare no pains to soften the severity of your lot,\nand you may on your part contribute towards rendering this savage and\ndesert abode less disagreeable to me.'  I replied in the manner which I\nthought best calculated to confirm the opinion he had formed of us.  He\ngave orders to have a habitation prepared for us in the town, and\ndetained us to supper.  I was really surprised to find so much\npoliteness in a governor of transported convicts.  In the presence of\nothers he abstained from enquiring about our past adventures.  The\nconversation was general; and in spite of our degradation, Manon and I\nexerted ourselves to make it lively and agreeable.\n\n\"At night we were conducted to the lodging prepared for us.  We found a\nwretched hovel composed of planks and mud, containing three rooms on\nthe ground, and a loft overhead.  He had sent there six chairs, and\nsome few necessaries of life.\n\n\"Manon appeared frightened by the first view of this melancholy\ndwelling.  It was on my account much more than upon her own, that she\ndistressed herself.  When we were left to ourselves, she sat down and\nwept bitterly.  I attempted at first to console her; but when she\nenabled me to understand that it was for my sake she deplored our\nprivations, and that in our common afflictions she only considered me\nas the sufferer, I put on an air of resolution, and even of content,\nsufficient to encourage her.\n\n\"'What is there in my lot to lament?' said I; 'I possess all that I\nhave ever desired.  You love me, Manon, do you not?  What happiness\nbeyond this have I ever longed for?  Let us leave to Providence the\ndirection of our destiny; it by no means appears to me so desperate.\nThe governor is civil and obliging; he has already given us marks of\nhis consideration; he will not allow us to want for necessaries.  As to\nour rude hut and the squalidness of our furniture, you might have\nnoticed that there are few persons in the colony better lodged or more\ncomfortably furnished than we are: and then you are an admirable\nchemist,' added I, embracing her; 'you transform everything into gold.'\n\n\"'In that case,' she answered, 'you shall be the richest man in the\nuniverse; for, as there never was love surpassing yours, so it is\nimpossible for man to be loved more tenderly than you are by me.  I\nwell know,' she continued, 'that I have never merited the almost\nincredible fidelity and attachment which you have shown for me.  I have\noften caused you annoyances, which nothing but excessive fondness could\nhave induced you to pardon.  I have been thoughtless and volatile; and\neven while loving you as I have always done to distraction, I was never\nfree from a consciousness of ingratitude.  But you cannot believe how\nmuch my nature is altered; those tears which you have so frequently\nseen me shed since quitting the French shore, have not been caused by\nmy own misfortunes.  Since you began to share them with me, I have been\na stranger to selfishness: I only wept from tenderness and compassion\nfor you.  I am inconsolable at the thought of having given you one\ninstant's pain during my past life.  I never cease upbraiding myself\nwith my former inconstancy, and wondering at the sacrifices which love\nhas induced you to make for a miserable and unworthy wretch, who could\nnot, with the last drop of her blood, compensate for half the torments\nshe has caused you.'\n\n\"Her grief, the language, and the tone in which she expressed herself,\nmade such an impression, that I felt my heart ready to break in me.\n'Take care,' said I to her, 'take care, dear Manon; I have not strength\nto endure such exciting marks of your affection; I am little accustomed\nto the rapturous sensations which you now kindle in my heart.  Oh\nHeaven!' cried I, 'I have now nothing further to ask of you.  I am sure\nof Manon's love. That has been alone wanting to complete my happiness;\nI can now never cease to be happy: my felicity is well secured.'\n\n\"'It is indeed,' she replied, 'if it depends upon me, and I well know\nwhere I can be ever certain of finding my own happiness centred.'\n\n\"With these ideas, capable of turning my hut into a palace worthy of\nearth's proudest monarch, I lay down to rest.  America appeared to my\nview the true land of milk and honey, the abode of contentment and\ndelight.  'People should come to New Orleans,' I often said to Manon,\n'who wish to enjoy the real rapture of love! It is here that love is\ndivested of all selfishness, all jealousy, all inconstancy.  Our\ncountrymen come here in search of gold; they little think that we have\ndiscovered treasures of inestimably greater value.'\n\n\"We carefully cultivated the governor's friendship.  He bestowed upon\nme, a few weeks after our arrival, a small appointment which became\nvacant in the fort.  Although not one of any distinction, I gratefully\naccepted it as a gift of Providence, as it enabled me to live\nindependently of others' aid.  I took a servant for myself, and a woman\nfor Manon.  Our little establishment became settled: nothing could\nsurpass the regularity of my conduct, or that of Manon; we lost no\nopportunity of serving or doing an act of kindness to our neighbours.\nThis friendly disposition, and the mildness of our manners, secured us\nthe confidence and affection of the whole colony.  We soon became so\nrespected, that we ranked as the principal persons in the town after\nthe governor.\n\n\"The simplicity of our habits and occupations, and the perfect\ninnocence in which we lived, revived insensibly our early feelings of\ndevotion.  Manon had never been an irreligious girl, and I was far from\nbeing one of those reckless libertines who delight in adding impiety\nand sacrilege to moral depravity: all the disorders of our lives might\nbe fairly ascribed to the natural influences of youth and love.\nExperience had now begun with us to do the office of age; it produced\nthe same effect upon us as years must have done.  Our conversation,\nwhich was generally of a serious turn, by degrees engendered a longing\nfor virtuous love.  I first proposed this change to Manon.  I knew the\nprinciples of her heart; she was frank and natural in all her\nsentiments, qualities which invariably predispose to virtue.  I said to\nher that there was but one thing wanting to complete our happiness: 'it\nis,' said I, 'to invoke upon our union the benediction of Heaven.  We\nhave both of us hearts too sensitive and minds too refined, to continue\nvoluntarily in the wilful violation of so sacred a duty.  It signifies\nnothing our having lived while in France in such a manner, because\nthere it was as impossible for us not to love, as to be united by a\nlegitimate tie: but in America, where we are under no restraint, where\nwe owe no allegiance to the arbitrary distinctions of birth and\naristocratic prejudice, where besides we are already supposed to be\nmarried, why should we not actually become so--why should we not\nsanctify our love by the holy ordinances of religion?  As for me,' I\nadded, 'I offer nothing new in offering you my hand and my heart; but I\nam ready to ratify it at the foot of the altar.'\n\n\"This speech seemed to inspire her with joy.  'Would you believe it,'\nshe replied, 'I have thought of this a thousand times since our arrival\nin America?  The fear of annoying you has kept it shut up in my breast.\nI felt that I had no pretensions to aspire to the character of your\nwife.'\n\n\"'Ah! Manon,' said I, 'you should very soon be a sovereign's consort,\nif I had been born to the inheritance of a crown.  Let us not hesitate;\nwe have no obstacle to impede us: I will this day speak to the governor\non the subject, and acknowledge that we have in this particular\nhitherto deceived him.  Let us leave,' added I, 'to vulgar lovers the\ndread of the indissoluble bonds of marriage;[1] they would not fear\nthem if they were assured, as we are, of the continuance of those of\nlove.'  I left Manon enchanted by this resolution.\n\n\"I am persuaded that no honest man could disapprove of this intention\nin my present situation; that is to say, fatally enslaved as I was by a\npassion which I could not subdue, and visited by compunction and\nremorse which I ought not to stifle. But will any man charge me with\ninjustice or impiety if I complain of the rigour of Heaven in defeating\na design that I could only have formed with the view of conciliating\nits favour and complying with its decrees?  Alas do I say defeated?\nnay punished as a new crime.  I was patiently permitted to go blindly\nalong the high road of vice; and the cruellest chastisements were\nreserved for the period when I was returning to the paths of virtue.  I\nnow fear that I shall have hardly fortitude enough left to recount the\nmost disastrous circumstances that ever occurred to any man.\n\n\"I waited upon the governor, as I had settled with Manon, to procure\nhis consent to the ceremony of our marriage.  I should have avoided\nspeaking to him or to any other person upon the subject, if I had\nimagined that his chaplain, who was the only minister in the town,\nwould have performed the office for me without his knowledge; but not\ndaring to hope that he would do so privately, I determined to act\ningenuously in the matter.\n\n\"The governor had a nephew named Synnelet, of whom he was particularly\nfond.  He was about thirty; brave, but of a headstrong and violent\ndisposition.  He was not married.  Manon's beauty had struck him on the\nfirst day of our arrival; and the numberless opportunities he had of\nseeing her during the last nine or ten months, had so inflamed his\npassion, that he was absolutely pining for her in secret.  However, as\nhe was convinced in common with his uncle and the whole colony that I\nwas married, he put such a restraint upon his feelings, that they\nremained generally unnoticed; and he lost no opportunity of showing the\nmost disinterested friendship for me.\n\n\"He happened to be with his uncle when I arrived at the government\nhouse.  I had no reason for keeping my intention a secret from him, so\nthat I explained myself without hesitation in his presence.  The\ngovernor heard me with his usual kindness.  I related to him a part of\nmy history, to which he listened with evident interest; and when I\nrequested his presence at the intended ceremony, he was so generous as\nto say, that he must be permitted to defray the expenses of the\nsucceeding entertainment. I retired perfectly satisfied.\n\n\"In an hour after, the chaplain paid me a visit.  I thought he was come\nto prepare me by religious instruction for the sacred ceremony; but,\nafter a cold salutation, he announced to me in two words, that the\ngovernor desired I would relinquish all thoughts of such a thing, for\nthat he had other views for Manon.\n\n\"'Other views for Manon!' said I, as I felt my heart sink within me;\n'what views then can they be, chaplain?'\n\n\"He replied, that I must be, of course, aware that the governor was\nabsolute master here; that Manon, having been transported from France\nto the colony, was entirely at his disposal; that, hitherto he had not\nexercised his right, believing that she was a married woman; but that\nnow, having learned from my own lips that it was not so, he had\nresolved to assign her to M. Synnelet, who was passionately in love\nwith her.\n\n\"My indignation overcame my prudence.  Irritated as I was, I desired\nthe chaplain instantly to quit my house, swearing at the same time that\nneither governor, Synnelet, nor the whole colony together, should lay\nhands upon my wife, or mistress, if they chose so to call her.\n\n\"I immediately told Manon of the distressing message I had just\nreceived.  We conjectured that Synnelet had warped his uncle's mind\nafter my departure, and that it was all the effect of a premeditated\ndesign.  They were, questionless, the stronger party.  We found\nourselves in New Orleans, as in the midst of the ocean, separated from\nthe rest of the world by an immense interval of space.  In a country\nperfectly unknown, a desert, or inhabited, if not by brutes, at least\nby savages quite as ferocious, to what corner could we fly?  I was\nrespected in the town, but I could not hope to excite the people in my\nfavour to such a degree as to derive assistance from them proportioned\nto the impending danger: money was requisite for that purpose, and I\nwas poor.  Besides, the success of a popular commotion was uncertain;\nand if we failed in the attempt, our doom would be inevitably sealed.\n\n\"I revolved these thoughts in my mind; I mentioned them in part to\nManon; I found new ones, without waiting for her replies; I determined\nupon one course, and then abandoned that to adopt another; I talked to\nmyself, and answered my own thoughts aloud; at length I sank into a\nkind of hysterical stupor that I can compare to nothing, because\nnothing ever equalled it.  Manon observed my emotion, and from its\nviolence, judged how imminent was our danger; and, apprehensive more on\nmy account than on her own, the dear girl could not even venture to\ngive expression to her fears.\n\n\"After a multitude of reflections, I resolved to call upon the\ngovernor, and appeal to his feelings of honour, to the recollection of\nmy unvarying respect for him, and the marks he had given of his own\naffection for us both.  Manon endeavoured to dissuade me from this\nattempt: she said, with tears in her eyes, 'You are rushing into the\njaws of death; they will murder you--I shall never again see you--I am\ndetermined to die before you.'  I had great difficulty in persuading\nher that it was absolutely necessary that I should go, and that she\nshould remain at home. I promised that she should see me again in a few\nmoments.  She did not foresee, nor did I, that it was against herself\nthe whole anger of Heaven, and the rabid fury of our enemies, was about\nto be concentrated.\n\n\"I went to the fort: the governor was there with his chaplain. I\nsupplicated him in a tone of humble submission that I could have ill\nbrooked under other circumstances.  I invoked his clemency by every\nargument calculated to soften any heart less ferocious and cruel than a\ntiger's.\n\n\"The barbarian made to all my prayers but two short answers, which he\nrepeated over and over again.  'Manon,' he said, 'was at his disposal:\nand he had given a promise to his nephew.'  I was resolved to command\nmy feelings to the last: I merely replied, that I had imagined he was\ntoo sincerely my friend to desire my death, to which I would infinitely\nrather consent than to the loss of my mistress.\n\n\"I felt persuaded, on quitting him, that it was folly to expect\nanything from the obstinate tyrant, who would have damned himself a\nhundred times over to please his nephew.  However, I persevered in\nrestraining my temper to the end; deeply resolved, if they persisted in\nsuch flagrant injustice, to make America the scene of one of the most\nhorrible and bloody murders that even love had ever led to.\n\n\"I was, on my return home, meditating upon this design, when fate, as\nif impatient to expedite my ruin, threw Synnelet in my way.  He read in\nmy countenance a portion of my thoughts.  I before said, he was brave.\nHe approached me.\n\n\"'Are you not seeking me?' he enquired.  'I know that my intentions\nhave given you mortal offence, and that the death of one of us is\nindispensable: let us see who is to be the happy man.'\n\n\"I replied, that such was unquestionably the fact, and that nothing but\ndeath could end the difference between us.\n\n\"We retired about one hundred paces out of the town.  We drew: I\nwounded and disarmed him at the first onset.  He was so enraged, that\nhe peremptorily refused either to ask his life or renounce his claims\nto Manon.  I might have been perhaps justified in ending both by a\nsingle blow; but noble blood ever vindicates its origin.  I threw him\nback his sword.  'Let us renew the struggle,' said I to him, 'and\nremember that there shall be now no quarter.'  He attacked me with\nredoubled fury.  I must confess that I was not an accomplished\nswordsman, having had but three months' tuition in Paris.  Love,\nhowever, guided my weapon. Synnelet pierced me through and through the\nleft arm; but I caught him whilst thus engaged, and made so vigorous a\nthrust that I stretched him senseless at my feet.\n\n\"In spite of the triumphant feeling that victory, after a mortal\nconflict, inspires, I was immediately horrified by the certain\nconsequences of his death.  There could not be the slightest hope of\neither pardon or respite from the vengeance I had thus incurred.\nAware, as I was, of the affection of the governor for his nephew, I\nfelt perfectly sure that my death would not be delayed a single hour\nafter his should become known.  'Urgent as this apprehension was, it\nstill was by no means the principal source of my uneasiness.  Manon,\nthe welfare of Manon, the peril that impended over her, and the\ncertainty of my being now at length separated from her, afflicted me to\nsuch a degree, that I was incapable of recognising the place in which I\nstood.  I regretted Synnelet's death: instant suicide seemed the only\nremedy for my woes.\n\n\"However, it was this very thought that quickly restored me to my\nreason, and enabled me to form a resolution.  'What,' said I to myself,\n'die, in order to end my pain!  Then there is something I dread more\nthan the loss of all I love!  No, let me suffer the cruellest\nextremities in order to aid her; and when these prove of no avail, fly\nto death as a last resource!'\n\n\"I returned towards the town; on my arrival at home, I found Manon half\ndead with fright and anxiety: my presence restored her.  I could not\nconceal from her the terrible accident that had happened.  On my\nmentioning the death of Synnelet and my own wound, she fell in a state\nof insensibility into my arms.  It was a quarter of an hour before I\ncould bring her again to her senses.\n\n\"I was myself in a most deplorable state of mind; I could not discern\nthe slightest prospect of safety for either of us. 'Manon,' said I to\nher, when she had recovered a little, 'what shall we do?  Alas, what\nhope remains to us?  I must necessarily fly.  Will you remain in the\ntown?  Yes dearest Manon, do remain; you may possibly still be happy\nhere; while I, far away from you, may seek death and find it amongst\nthe savages, or the wild beasts.'\n\n\"She raised herself in spite of her weakness, and taking hold of my\nhand to lead me towards the door:  'Let us,' said she, 'fly together,\nwe have not a moment to lose; Synnelet's body may be found by chance,\nand we shall then have no time to escape.' 'But, dear Manon,' replied\nI, 'to what place can we fly?  Do you perceive any resource?  Would it\nnot be better that you should endeavour to live on without me; and that\nI should go and voluntarily place my life in the governor's hands?'\n\n\"This proposal had only the effect of making her more impatient for our\ndeparture.  I had presence of mind enough, on going out, to take with\nme some strong liquors which I had in my chamber, and as much food as I\ncould carry in my pockets.  We told our servants, who were in the\nadjoining room, that we were going to take our evening walk, as was our\ninvariable habit; and we left the town behind us more rapidly than I\nhad thought possible from Manon's delicate state of health.\n\n\"Although I had not formed any resolve as to our future destination, I\nstill cherished a hope, without which I should have infinitely\npreferred death to my suspense about Manon's safety.  I had acquired a\nsufficient knowledge of the country, during nearly ten months which I\nhad now passed in America, to know in what manner the natives should be\napproached.  Death was not the necessary consequence of falling into\ntheir hands.  I had learned a few words of their language, and some of\ntheir customs, having had many opportunities of seeing them.\n\n\"Besides this sad resource, I derived some hopes from the fact, that\nthe English had, like ourselves, established colonies in this part of\nthe New World.  But the distance was terrific.  In order to reach them,\nwe should have to traverse deserts of many days' journey, and more than\none range of mountains so steep and vast as to seem almost impassable\nto the strongest man.  I nevertheless flattered myself that we might\nderive partial relief from one or other of these sources: the savages\nmight serve us as guides, and the English receive us in their\nsettlements.\n\n\"We journeyed on as long as Manon's strength would permit, that is to\nsay, about six miles; for this incomparable creature, with her usual\nabsence of selfishness, refused my repeated entreaties to stop.\nOverpowered at length by fatigue, she acknowledged the utter\nimpossibility of proceeding farther.  It was already night: we sat down\nin the midst of an extensive plain, where we could not even find a tree\nto shelter us.  Her first care was to dress my wound, which she had\nbandaged before our departure. I, in vain, entreated her to desist from\nexertion: it would have only added to her distress if I had refused her\nthe satisfaction of seeing me at ease and out of danger, before her own\nwants were attended to.  I allowed her therefore to gratify herself,\nand in shame and silence submitted to her delicate attentions.\n\n\"But when she had completed her tender task, with what ardour did I not\nenter upon mine!  I took off my clothes and stretched them under her,\nto render more endurable the hard and rugged ground on which she lay.\nI protected her delicate hands from the cold by my burning kisses and\nthe warmth of my sighs.  I passed the livelong night in watching over\nher as she slept, and praying Heaven to refresh her with soft and\nundisturbed repose.  'You can bear witness, just and all-seeing God! to\nthe fervour and sincerity of those prayers, and Thou alone knowest with\nwhat awful rigour they were rejected.'\n\n\"You will excuse me, if I now cut short a story which it distresses me\nbeyond endurance to relate.  It is, I believe, a calamity without\nparallel.  I can never cease to deplore it.  But although it continues,\nof course, deeply and indelibly impressed on my memory, yet my heart\nseems to shrink within me each time that I attempt the recital.\n\n\"We had thus tranquilly passed the night.  I had fondly imagined that\nmy beloved mistress was in a profound sleep, and I hardly dared to\nbreathe lest I should disturb her.  As day broke, I observed that her\nhands were cold and trembling; I pressed them to my bosom in the hope\nof restoring animation.  This movement roused her attention, and making\nan effort to grasp my hand, she said, in a feeble voice, that she\nthought her last moments had arrived.\n\n\"I, at first, took this for a passing weakness, or the ordinary\nlanguage of distress; and I answered with the usual consolations that\nlove prompted.  But her incessant sighs, her silence, and inattention\nto my enquiries, the convulsed grasp of her hands, in which she\nretained mine, soon convinced me that the crowning end of all my\nmiseries was approaching.\n\n\"Do not now expect me to attempt a description of my feelings, or to\nrepeat her dying expressions.  I lost her--I received the purest\nassurances of her love even at the very instant that her spirit fled.\nI have not nerve to say more upon this fatal and disastrous event.\n\n\"My spirit was not destined to accompany Manon's.  Doubtless, Heaven\ndid not as yet consider me sufficiently punished, and therefore\nordained that I should continue to drag on a languid and joyless\nexistence.  I willingly renounced every hope of leading a happy one.\n\n\"I remained for twenty-four hours without taking my lips from the still\nbeauteous countenance and hands of my adored Manon.  My intention was\nto await my own death in that position; but at the beginning of the\nsecond day, I reflected that, after I was gone, she must of necessity\nbecome the prey of wild beasts.  I then determined to bury her, and\nwait my own doom upon her grave.  I was already, indeed, so near my end\nfrom the combined effect of long fasting and grief, that it was with\nthe greatest difficulty I could support myself standing.  I was obliged\nto have recourse to the liquors which I had brought with me, and these\nrestored sufficient strength to enable me to set about my last sad\noffice. From the sandy nature of the soil there was little trouble in\nopening the ground.  I broke my sword and used it for the purpose; but\nmy bare hands were of greater service.  I dug a deep grave, and there\ndeposited the idol of my heart, after having wrapt around her my\nclothes to prevent the sand from touching her.  I kissed her ten\nthousand times with all the ardour of the most glowing love, before I\nlaid her in this melancholy bed.  I sat for some time upon the bank\nintently gazing on her, and could not command fortitude enough to close\nthe grave over her.  At length, feeling that my strength was giving\nway, and apprehensive of its being entirely exhausted before the\ncompletion of my task, I committed to the earth all that it had ever\ncontained most perfect and peerless.  I then lay myself with my face\ndown upon the grave, and closing my eyes with the determination never\nagain to open them, I invoked the mercy of Heaven, and ardently prayed\nfor death.\n\n\"You will find it difficult to believe that, during the whole time of\nthis protracted and distressing ceremony, not a tear or a sigh escaped\nto relieve my agony.  The state of profound affliction in which I was,\nand the deep settled resolution I had taken to die, had silenced the\nsighs of despair, and effectually dried up the ordinary channels of\ngrief.  It was thus impossible for me, in this posture upon the grave,\nto continue for any time in possession of my faculties.\n\n\"After what you have listened to, the remainder of my own history would\nill repay the attention you seem inclined to bestow upon it.  Synnelet\nhaving been carried into the town and skilfully examined, it was found\nthat, so far from being dead, he was not even dangerously wounded.  He\ninformed his uncle of the manner in which the affray had occurred\nbetween us, and he generously did justice to my conduct on the\noccasion.  I was sent for; and as neither of us could be found, our\nflight was immediately suspected.  It was then too late to attempt to\ntrace me, but the next day and the following one were employed in the\npursuit.\n\n\"I was found, without any appearance of life, upon the grave of Manon:\nand the persons who discovered me in this situation, seeing that I was\nalmost naked and bleeding from my wounds, naturally supposed that I had\nbeen robbed and assassinated.  They carried me into the town.  The\nmotion restored me to my senses. The sighs I heaved on opening my eyes\nand finding myself still amongst the living, showed that I was not\nbeyond the reach of art: they were but too successful in its\napplication.\n\n\"I was immediately confined as a close prisoner.  My trial was ordered;\nand as Manon was not forthcoming, I was accused of having murdered her\nfrom rage and jealousy.  I naturally related all that had occurred.\nSynnelet, though bitterly grieved and disappointed by what he heard,\nhad the generosity to solicit my pardon: he obtained it.\n\n\"I was so reduced, that they were obliged to carry me from the prison\nto my bed, and there I suffered for three long months under severe\nillness.  My aversion from life knew no diminution. I continually\nprayed for death, and obstinately for some time refused every remedy.\nBut Providence, after having punished me with atoning rigour, saw fit\nto turn to my own use its chastisements and the memory of my multiplied\nsorrows.  It at length deigned to shed upon me its redeeming light, and\nrevived in my mind ideas worthy of my birth and my early education.\n\n\"My tranquillity of mind being again restored, my cure speedily\nfollowed.  I began only to feel the highest aspirations of honour, and\ndiligently performed the duties of my appointment, whilst expecting the\narrival of the vessels from France, which were always due at this\nperiod of the year.  I resolved to return to my native country, there\nto expiate the scandal of my former life by my future good conduct.\nSynnelet had the remains of my dear mistress removed into a more\nhallowed spot.\n\n\"It was six weeks after my recovery that, one day walking alone upon\nthe banks of the river, I saw a vessel arrive, which some mercantile\nspeculation had directed to New Orleans.  I stood by whilst the\npassengers landed.  Judge my surprise on recognising Tiberge amongst\nthose who proceeded towards the town.  This ever-faithful friend knew\nme at a distance, in spite of the ravages which care and sorrow had\nworked upon my countenance.  He told me that the sole object of his\nvoyage had been to see me once more, and to induce me to return with\nhim to France; that on receipt of the last letter which I had written\nto him from Havre, he started for that place, and was himself the\nbearer of the succour which I solicited; that he had been sensibly\naffected on learning my departure, and that he would have instantly\nfollowed me, if there had been a vessel bound for the same destination;\nthat he had been for several months endeavouring to hear of one in the\nvarious seaport towns, and that, having at length found one at St. Malo\nwhich was weighing anchor for Martinique, he embarked, in the\nexpectation of easily passing from thence to New Orleans; that the St.\nMalo vessel having been captured by Spanish pirates and taken to one of\ntheir islands, he had contrived to escape; and that, in short, after\nmany adventures, he had got on board the vessel which had just arrived,\nand at length happily attained his object.\n\n\"I was totally unable adequately to express my feelings of gratitude to\nthis generous and unshaken friend.  I conducted him to my house, and\nplaced all I possessed at his service.  I related to him every\ncircumstance that had occurred to me since I left France: and in order\nto gladden him with tidings which I knew he did not expect, I assured\nhim that the seeds of virtue which he had in former days implanted in\nmy heart, were now about to produce fruit, of which even he should be\nproud.  He declared to me, that this gladdening announcement more than\nrepaid him for all the fatigue and trouble he had endured.\n\n\"We passed two months together at New Orleans whilst waiting the\ndeparture of a vessel direct to France; and having at length sailed, we\nlanded only a fortnight since at Havre-de-Grace.  On my arrival I wrote\nto my family.  By a letter from my elder brother, I there learned my\nfather's death, which, I dread to think, the disorders of my youth\nmight have hastened.  The wind being favourable for Calais, I embarked\nfor this port, and am now going to the house of one of my relations who\nlives a few miles off, where my brother said that he should anxiously\nawait my arrival.\"\n\n\n[1] Some say that Love, at sight of human ties,\n    Spreads his light wings, and in a moment flies."
