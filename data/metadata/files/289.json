THE RIVER BANK\n\nThe Mole had been working very hard all the morning, spring-cleaning his\nlittle home. First with brooms, then with dusters; then on ladders and\nsteps and chairs, with a brush and a pail of whitewash; till he had dust\nin his throat and eyes, and splashes of whitewash all over his black\nfur, and an aching back and weary arms. Spring was moving in the air\nabove and in the earth below and around him, penetrating even his dark\nand lowly little house with its spirit of divine discontent and longing.\nIt was small wonder, then, that he suddenly flung down his brush on the\nfloor, said ‘Bother!’ and ‘O blow!’ and also ‘Hang spring-cleaning!’\nand bolted out of the house without even waiting to put on his coat.\nSomething up above was calling him imperiously, and he made for\nthe steep little tunnel which answered in his case to the gravelled\ncarriage-drive owned by animals whose residences are nearer to the sun\nand air. So he scraped and scratched and scrabbled and scrooged and\nthen he scrooged again and scrabbled and scratched and scraped, working\nbusily with his little paws and muttering to himself, ‘Up we go! Up we\ngo!’ till at last, pop! his snout came out into the sunlight, and he\nfound himself rolling in the warm grass of a great meadow.\n\n‘This is fine!’ he said to himself. ‘This is better than whitewashing!’\nThe sunshine struck hot on his fur, soft breezes caressed his heated\nbrow, and after the seclusion of the cellarage he had lived in so long\nthe carol of happy birds fell on his dulled hearing almost like a shout.\nJumping off all his four legs at once, in the joy of living and the\ndelight of spring without its cleaning, he pursued his way across the\nmeadow till he reached the hedge on the further side.\n\n‘Hold up!’ said an elderly rabbit at the gap. ‘Sixpence for the\nprivilege of passing by the private road!’ He was bowled over in an\ninstant by the impatient and contemptuous Mole, who trotted along the\nside of the hedge chaffing the other rabbits as they peeped hurriedly\nfrom their holes to see what the row was about. ‘Onion-sauce!\nOnion-sauce!’ he remarked jeeringly, and was gone before they could\nthink of a thoroughly satisfactory reply. Then they all started\ngrumbling at each other. ‘How STUPID you are! Why didn’t you tell\nhim----’ ‘Well, why didn’t YOU say----’ ‘You might have reminded\nhim----’ and so on, in the usual way; but, of course, it was then much\ntoo late, as is always the case.\n\nIt all seemed too good to be true. Hither and thither through the\nmeadows he rambled busily, along the hedgerows, across the\ncopses, finding everywhere birds building, flowers budding, leaves\nthrusting--everything happy, and progressive, and occupied. And instead\nof having an uneasy conscience pricking him and whispering ‘whitewash!’\nhe somehow could only feel how jolly it was to be the only idle dog\namong all these busy citizens. After all, the best part of a holiday\nis perhaps not so much to be resting yourself, as to see all the other\nfellows busy working.\n\nHe thought his happiness was complete when, as he meandered aimlessly\nalong, suddenly he stood by the edge of a full-fed river. Never in\nhis life had he seen a river before--this sleek, sinuous, full-bodied\nanimal, chasing and chuckling, gripping things with a gurgle and\nleaving them with a laugh, to fling itself on fresh playmates that shook\nthemselves free, and were caught and held again. All was a-shake and\na-shiver--glints and gleams and sparkles, rustle and swirl, chatter and\nbubble. The Mole was bewitched, entranced, fascinated. By the side of\nthe river he trotted as one trots, when very small, by the side of a man\nwho holds one spell-bound by exciting stories; and when tired at\nlast, he sat on the bank, while the river still chattered on to him,\na babbling procession of the best stories in the world, sent from the\nheart of the earth to be told at last to the insatiable sea.\n\nAs he sat on the grass and looked across the river, a dark hole in the\nbank opposite, just above the water’s edge, caught his eye, and dreamily\nhe fell to considering what a nice snug dwelling-place it would make for\nan animal with few wants and fond of a bijou riverside residence, above\nflood level and remote from noise and dust. As he gazed, something\nbright and small seemed to twinkle down in the heart of it, vanished,\nthen twinkled once more like a tiny star. But it could hardly be a star\nin such an unlikely situation; and it was too glittering and small for a\nglow-worm. Then, as he looked, it winked at him, and so declared itself\nto be an eye; and a small face began gradually to grow up round it, like\na frame round a picture.\n\nA brown little face, with whiskers.\n\nA grave round face, with the same twinkle in its eye that had first\nattracted his notice.\n\nSmall neat ears and thick silky hair.\n\nIt was the Water Rat!\n\nThen the two animals stood and regarded each other cautiously.\n\n‘Hullo, Mole!’ said the Water Rat.\n\n‘Hullo, Rat!’ said the Mole.\n\n‘Would you like to come over?’ enquired the Rat presently.\n\n‘Oh, its all very well to TALK,’ said the Mole, rather pettishly, he\nbeing new to a river and riverside life and its ways.\n\nThe Rat said nothing, but stooped and unfastened a rope and hauled\non it; then lightly stepped into a little boat which the Mole had not\nobserved. It was painted blue outside and white within, and was just the\nsize for two animals; and the Mole’s whole heart went out to it at once,\neven though he did not yet fully understand its uses.\n\nThe Rat sculled smartly across and made fast. Then he held up his\nforepaw as the Mole stepped gingerly down. ‘Lean on that!’ he said.\n‘Now then, step lively!’ and the Mole to his surprise and rapture found\nhimself actually seated in the stern of a real boat.\n\n‘This has been a wonderful day!’ said he, as the Rat shoved off and took\nto the sculls again. ‘Do you know, I’ve never been in a boat before in\nall my life.’\n\n‘What?’ cried the Rat, open-mouthed: ‘Never been in a--you never--well\nI--what have you been doing, then?’\n\n‘Is it so nice as all that?’ asked the Mole shyly, though he was quite\nprepared to believe it as he leant back in his seat and surveyed the\ncushions, the oars, the rowlocks, and all the fascinating fittings, and\nfelt the boat sway lightly under him.\n\n‘Nice? It’s the ONLY thing,’ said the Water Rat solemnly, as he\nleant forward for his stroke. ‘Believe me, my young friend, there is\nNOTHING--absolute nothing--half so much worth doing as simply\nmessing about in boats. Simply messing,’ he went on dreamily:\n‘messing--about--in--boats; messing----’\n\n‘Look ahead, Rat!’ cried the Mole suddenly.\n\nIt was too late. The boat struck the bank full tilt. The dreamer, the\njoyous oarsman, lay on his back at the bottom of the boat, his heels in\nthe air.\n\n‘--about in boats--or WITH boats,’ the Rat went on composedly, picking\nhimself up with a pleasant laugh. ‘In or out of ‘em, it doesn’t matter.\nNothing seems really to matter, that’s the charm of it. Whether you get\naway, or whether you don’t; whether you arrive at your destination or\nwhether you reach somewhere else, or whether you never get anywhere at\nall, you’re always busy, and you never do anything in particular; and\nwhen you’ve done it there’s always something else to do, and you can do\nit if you like, but you’d much better not. Look here! If you’ve really\nnothing else on hand this morning, supposing we drop down the river\ntogether, and have a long day of it?’\n\nThe Mole waggled his toes from sheer happiness, spread his chest with\na sigh of full contentment, and leaned back blissfully into the soft\ncushions. ‘WHAT a day I’m having!’ he said. ‘Let us start at once!’\n\n‘Hold hard a minute, then!’ said the Rat. He looped the painter through\na ring in his landing-stage, climbed up into his hole above, and after\na short interval reappeared staggering under a fat, wicker\nluncheon-basket.\n\n‘Shove that under your feet,’ he observed to the Mole, as he passed\nit down into the boat. Then he untied the painter and took the sculls\nagain.\n\n‘What’s inside it?’ asked the Mole, wriggling with curiosity.\n\n‘There’s cold chicken inside it,’ replied the Rat briefly;\n‘coldtonguecoldhamcoldbeefpickledgherkinssaladfrenchrollscresssan-\ndwichespottedmeatgingerbeerlemonadesodawater----’\n\n‘O stop, stop,’ cried the Mole in ecstacies: ‘This is too much!’\n\n‘Do you really think so?’ enquired the Rat seriously. ‘It’s only what I\nalways take on these little excursions; and the other animals are always\ntelling me that I’m a mean beast and cut it VERY fine!’\n\nThe Mole never heard a word he was saying. Absorbed in the new life he\nwas entering upon, intoxicated with the sparkle, the ripple, the scents\nand the sounds and the sunlight, he trailed a paw in the water and\ndreamed long waking dreams. The Water Rat, like the good little fellow\nhe was, sculled steadily on and forebore to disturb him.\n\n‘I like your clothes awfully, old chap,’ he remarked after some half\nan hour or so had passed. ‘I’m going to get a black velvet smoking-suit\nmyself some day, as soon as I can afford it.’\n\n‘I beg your pardon,’ said the Mole, pulling himself together with an\neffort. ‘You must think me very rude; but all this is so new to me.\nSo--this--is--a--River!’\n\n‘THE River,’ corrected the Rat.\n\n‘And you really live by the river? What a jolly life!’\n\n‘By it and with it and on it and in it,’ said the Rat. ‘It’s brother\nand sister to me, and aunts, and company, and food and drink, and\n(naturally) washing. It’s my world, and I don’t want any other. What it\nhasn’t got is not worth having, and what it doesn’t know is not worth\nknowing. Lord! the times we’ve had together! Whether in winter or\nsummer, spring or autumn, it’s always got its fun and its excitements.\nWhen the floods are on in February, and my cellars and basement are\nbrimming with drink that’s no good to me, and the brown water runs by my\nbest bedroom window; or again when it all drops away and, shows patches\nof mud that smells like plum-cake, and the rushes and weed clog the\nchannels, and I can potter about dry shod over most of the bed of it and\nfind fresh food to eat, and things careless people have dropped out of\nboats!’\n\n‘But isn’t it a bit dull at times?’ the Mole ventured to ask. ‘Just you\nand the river, and no one else to pass a word with?’\n\n‘No one else to--well, I mustn’t be hard on you,’ said the Rat with\nforbearance. ‘You’re new to it, and of course you don’t know. The bank\nis so crowded nowadays that many people are moving away altogether: O\nno, it isn’t what it used to be, at all. Otters, kingfishers, dabchicks,\nmoorhens, all of them about all day long and always wanting you to DO\nsomething--as if a fellow had no business of his own to attend to!’\n\n‘What lies over THERE’ asked the Mole, waving a paw towards a background\nof woodland that darkly framed the water-meadows on one side of the\nriver.\n\n‘That? O, that’s just the Wild Wood,’ said the Rat shortly. ‘We don’t go\nthere very much, we river-bankers.’\n\n‘Aren’t they--aren’t they very NICE people in there?’ said the Mole, a\ntrifle nervously.\n\n‘W-e-ll,’ replied the Rat, ‘let me see. The squirrels are all right. AND\nthe rabbits--some of ‘em, but rabbits are a mixed lot. And then there’s\nBadger, of course. He lives right in the heart of it; wouldn’t live\nanywhere else, either, if you paid him to do it. Dear old Badger! Nobody\ninterferes with HIM. They’d better not,’ he added significantly.\n\n‘Why, who SHOULD interfere with him?’ asked the Mole.\n\n‘Well, of course--there--are others,’ explained the Rat in a hesitating\nsort of way.\n\n‘Weasels--and stoats--and foxes--and so on. They’re all right in a\nway--I’m very good friends with them--pass the time of day when we meet,\nand all that--but they break out sometimes, there’s no denying it, and\nthen--well, you can’t really trust them, and that’s the fact.’\n\nThe Mole knew well that it is quite against animal-etiquette to dwell\non possible trouble ahead, or even to allude to it; so he dropped the\nsubject.\n\n‘And beyond the Wild Wood again?’ he asked: ‘Where it’s all blue\nand dim, and one sees what may be hills or perhaps they mayn’t, and\nsomething like the smoke of towns, or is it only cloud-drift?’\n\n‘Beyond the Wild Wood comes the Wide World,’ said the Rat. ‘And that’s\nsomething that doesn’t matter, either to you or me. I’ve never been\nthere, and I’m never going, nor you either, if you’ve got any sense\nat all. Don’t ever refer to it again, please. Now then! Here’s our\nbackwater at last, where we’re going to lunch.’\n\nLeaving the main stream, they now passed into what seemed at first sight\nlike a little land-locked lake. Green turf sloped down to either edge,\nbrown snaky tree-roots gleamed below the surface of the quiet water,\nwhile ahead of them the silvery shoulder and foamy tumble of a weir,\narm-in-arm with a restless dripping mill-wheel, that held up in its\nturn a grey-gabled mill-house, filled the air with a soothing murmur\nof sound, dull and smothery, yet with little clear voices speaking up\ncheerfully out of it at intervals. It was so very beautiful that the\nMole could only hold up both forepaws and gasp, ‘O my! O my! O my!’\n\nThe Rat brought the boat alongside the bank, made her fast, helped the\nstill awkward Mole safely ashore, and swung out the luncheon-basket. The\nMole begged as a favour to be allowed to unpack it all by himself; and\nthe Rat was very pleased to indulge him, and to sprawl at full length on\nthe grass and rest, while his excited friend shook out the table-cloth\nand spread it, took out all the mysterious packets one by one and\narranged their contents in due order, still gasping, ‘O my! O my!’ at\neach fresh revelation. When all was ready, the Rat said, ‘Now, pitch\nin, old fellow!’ and the Mole was indeed very glad to obey, for he had\nstarted his spring-cleaning at a very early hour that morning, as people\nWILL do, and had not paused for bite or sup; and he had been through a\nvery great deal since that distant time which now seemed so many days\nago.\n\n‘What are you looking at?’ said the Rat presently, when the edge of\ntheir hunger was somewhat dulled, and the Mole’s eyes were able to\nwander off the table-cloth a little.\n\n‘I am looking,’ said the Mole, ‘at a streak of bubbles that I see\ntravelling along the surface of the water. That is a thing that strikes\nme as funny.’\n\n‘Bubbles? Oho!’ said the Rat, and chirruped cheerily in an inviting sort\nof way.\n\nA broad glistening muzzle showed itself above the edge of the bank, and\nthe Otter hauled himself out and shook the water from his coat.\n\n‘Greedy beggars!’ he observed, making for the provender. ‘Why didn’t you\ninvite me, Ratty?’\n\n‘This was an impromptu affair,’ explained the Rat. ‘By the way--my\nfriend Mr. Mole.’\n\n‘Proud, I’m sure,’ said the Otter, and the two animals were friends\nforthwith.\n\n‘Such a rumpus everywhere!’ continued the Otter. ‘All the world seems\nout on the river to-day. I came up this backwater to try and get a\nmoment’s peace, and then stumble upon you fellows!--At least--I beg\npardon--I don’t exactly mean that, you know.’\n\nThere was a rustle behind them, proceeding from a hedge wherein last\nyear’s leaves still clung thick, and a stripy head, with high shoulders\nbehind it, peered forth on them.\n\n‘Come on, old Badger!’ shouted the Rat.\n\nThe Badger trotted forward a pace or two; then grunted, ‘H’m! Company,’\nand turned his back and disappeared from view.\n\n‘That’s JUST the sort of fellow he is!’ observed the disappointed Rat.\n‘Simply hates Society! Now we shan’t see any more of him to-day. Well,\ntell us, WHO’S out on the river?’\n\n‘Toad’s out, for one,’ replied the Otter. ‘In his brand-new wager-boat;\nnew togs, new everything!’\n\nThe two animals looked at each other and laughed.\n\n‘Once, it was nothing but sailing,’ said the Rat, ‘Then he tired of that\nand took to punting. Nothing would please him but to punt all day\nand every day, and a nice mess he made of it. Last year it was\nhouse-boating, and we all had to go and stay with him in his house-boat,\nand pretend we liked it. He was going to spend the rest of his life in\na house-boat. It’s all the same, whatever he takes up; he gets tired of\nit, and starts on something fresh.’\n\n‘Such a good fellow, too,’ remarked the Otter reflectively: ‘But no\nstability--especially in a boat!’\n\nFrom where they sat they could get a glimpse of the main stream across\nthe island that separated them; and just then a wager-boat flashed into\nview, the rower--a short, stout figure--splashing badly and rolling a\ngood deal, but working his hardest. The Rat stood up and hailed him, but\nToad--for it was he--shook his head and settled sternly to his work.\n\n‘He’ll be out of the boat in a minute if he rolls like that,’ said the\nRat, sitting down again.\n\n‘Of course he will,’ chuckled the Otter. ‘Did I ever tell you that good\nstory about Toad and the lock-keeper? It happened this way. Toad....’\n\nAn errant May-fly swerved unsteadily athwart the current in the\nintoxicated fashion affected by young bloods of May-flies seeing life. A\nswirl of water and a ‘cloop!’ and the May-fly was visible no more.\n\nNeither was the Otter.\n\nThe Mole looked down. The voice was still in his ears, but the turf\nwhereon he had sprawled was clearly vacant. Not an Otter to be seen, as\nfar as the distant horizon.\n\nBut again there was a streak of bubbles on the surface of the river.\n\nThe Rat hummed a tune, and the Mole recollected that animal-etiquette\nforbade any sort of comment on the sudden disappearance of one’s friends\nat any moment, for any reason or no reason whatever.\n\n‘Well, well,’ said the Rat, ‘I suppose we ought to be moving. I wonder\nwhich of us had better pack the luncheon-basket?’ He did not speak as if\nhe was frightfully eager for the treat.\n\n‘O, please let me,’ said the Mole. So, of course, the Rat let him.\n\nPacking the basket was not quite such pleasant work as unpacking’ the\nbasket. It never is. But the Mole was bent on enjoying everything, and\nalthough just when he had got the basket packed and strapped up tightly\nhe saw a plate staring up at him from the grass, and when the job had\nbeen done again the Rat pointed out a fork which anybody ought to\nhave seen, and last of all, behold! the mustard pot, which he had been\nsitting on without knowing it--still, somehow, the thing got finished at\nlast, without much loss of temper.\n\nThe afternoon sun was getting low as the Rat sculled gently homewards in\na dreamy mood, murmuring poetry-things over to himself, and not paying\nmuch attention to Mole. But the Mole was very full of lunch, and\nself-satisfaction, and pride, and already quite at home in a boat (so he\nthought) and was getting a bit restless besides: and presently he said,\n‘Ratty! Please, _I_ want to row, now!’\n\nThe Rat shook his head with a smile. ‘Not yet, my young friend,’ he\nsaid--‘wait till you’ve had a few lessons. It’s not so easy as it\nlooks.’\n\nThe Mole was quiet for a minute or two. But he began to feel more and\nmore jealous of Rat, sculling so strongly and so easily along, and his\npride began to whisper that he could do it every bit as well. He jumped\nup and seized the sculls, so suddenly, that the Rat, who was gazing out\nover the water and saying more poetry-things to himself, was taken by\nsurprise and fell backwards off his seat with his legs in the air for\nthe second time, while the triumphant Mole took his place and grabbed\nthe sculls with entire confidence.\n\n‘Stop it, you SILLY ass!’ cried the Rat, from the bottom of the boat.\n‘You can’t do it! You’ll have us over!’\n\nThe Mole flung his sculls back with a flourish, and made a great dig at\nthe water. He missed the surface altogether, his legs flew up above\nhis head, and he found himself lying on the top of the prostrate Rat.\nGreatly alarmed, he made a grab at the side of the boat, and the next\nmoment--Sploosh!\n\nOver went the boat, and he found himself struggling in the river.\n\nO my, how cold the water was, and O, how VERY wet it felt. How it sang\nin his ears as he went down, down, down! How bright and welcome the sun\nlooked as he rose to the surface coughing and spluttering! How black was\nhis despair when he felt himself sinking again! Then a firm paw gripped\nhim by the back of his neck. It was the Rat, and he was evidently\nlaughing--the Mole could FEEL him laughing, right down his arm and\nthrough his paw, and so into his--the Mole’s--neck.\n\nThe Rat got hold of a scull and shoved it under the Mole’s arm; then he\ndid the same by the other side of him and, swimming behind, propelled\nthe helpless animal to shore, hauled him out, and set him down on the\nbank, a squashy, pulpy lump of misery.\n\nWhen the Rat had rubbed him down a bit, and wrung some of the wet out of\nhim, he said, ‘Now, then, old fellow! Trot up and down the towing-path\nas hard as you can, till you’re warm and dry again, while I dive for the\nluncheon-basket.’\n\nSo the dismal Mole, wet without and ashamed within, trotted about till\nhe was fairly dry, while the Rat plunged into the water again, recovered\nthe boat, righted her and made her fast, fetched his floating\nproperty to shore by degrees, and finally dived successfully for the\nluncheon-basket and struggled to land with it.\n\nWhen all was ready for a start once more, the Mole, limp and dejected,\ntook his seat in the stern of the boat; and as they set off, he said in\na low voice, broken with emotion, ‘Ratty, my generous friend! I am very\nsorry indeed for my foolish and ungrateful conduct. My heart quite fails\nme when I think how I might have lost that beautiful luncheon-basket.\nIndeed, I have been a complete ass, and I know it. Will you overlook it\nthis once and forgive me, and let things go on as before?’\n\n‘That’s all right, bless you!’ responded the Rat cheerily. ‘What’s a\nlittle wet to a Water Rat? I’m more in the water than out of it most\ndays. Don’t you think any more about it; and, look here! I really think\nyou had better come and stop with me for a little time. It’s very plain\nand rough, you know--not like Toad’s house at all--but you haven’t seen\nthat yet; still, I can make you comfortable. And I’ll teach you to row,\nand to swim, and you’ll soon be as handy on the water as any of us.’\n\nThe Mole was so touched by his kind manner of speaking that he could\nfind no voice to answer him; and he had to brush away a tear or two with\nthe back of his paw. But the Rat kindly looked in another direction, and\npresently the Mole’s spirits revived again, and he was even able to give\nsome straight back-talk to a couple of moorhens who were sniggering to\neach other about his bedraggled appearance.\n\nWhen they got home, the Rat made a bright fire in the parlour, and\nplanted the Mole in an arm-chair in front of it, having fetched down\na dressing-gown and slippers for him, and told him river stories till\nsupper-time. Very thrilling stories they were, too, to an earth-dwelling\nanimal like Mole. Stories about weirs, and sudden floods, and leaping\npike, and steamers that flung hard bottles--at least bottles were\ncertainly flung, and FROM steamers, so presumably BY them; and about\nherons, and how particular they were whom they spoke to; and about\nadventures down drains, and night-fishings with Otter, or excursions far\na-field with Badger. Supper was a most cheerful meal; but very shortly\nafterwards a terribly sleepy Mole had to be escorted upstairs by his\nconsiderate host, to the best bedroom, where he soon laid his head on\nhis pillow in great peace and contentment, knowing that his new-found\nfriend the River was lapping the sill of his window.\n\nThis day was only the first of many similar ones for the emancipated\nMole, each of them longer and full of interest as the ripening summer\nmoved onward. He learnt to swim and to row, and entered into the joy\nof running water; and with his ear to the reed-stems he caught, at\nintervals, something of what the wind went whispering so constantly\namong them.\n\n\n\n\nII. THE OPEN ROAD\n\n\n‘Ratty,’ said the Mole suddenly, one bright summer morning, ‘if you\nplease, I want to ask you a favour.’\n\nThe Rat was sitting on the river bank, singing a little song. He had\njust composed it himself, so he was very taken up with it, and would not\npay proper attention to Mole or anything else. Since early morning he\nhad been swimming in the river, in company with his friends the ducks.\nAnd when the ducks stood on their heads suddenly, as ducks will, he\nwould dive down and tickle their necks, just under where their chins\nwould be if ducks had chins, till they were forced to come to the\nsurface again in a hurry, spluttering and angry and shaking their\nfeathers at him, for it is impossible to say quite ALL you feel when\nyour head is under water. At last they implored him to go away and\nattend to his own affairs and leave them to mind theirs. So the Rat went\naway, and sat on the river bank in the sun, and made up a song about\nthem, which he called\n\n\n            ‘DUCKS’ DITTY.’\n\n          All along the backwater,\n          Through the rushes tall,\n          Ducks are a-dabbling,\n          Up tails all!\n          Ducks’ tails, drakes’ tails,\n          Yellow feet a-quiver,\n          Yellow bills all out of sight\n          Busy in the river!\n\n          Slushy green undergrowth\n          Where the roach swim--\n          Here we keep our larder,\n          Cool and full and dim.\n\n          Everyone for what he likes!\n          _We_ like to be\n          Heads down, tails up,\n          Dabbling free!\n\n          High in the blue above\n          Swifts whirl and call--\n          _We_ are down a-dabbling\n          Uptails all!\n\n\n‘I don’t know that I think so VERY much of that little song, Rat,’\nobserved the Mole cautiously. He was no poet himself and didn’t care who\nknew it; and he had a candid nature.\n\n‘Nor don’t the ducks neither,’ replied the Rat cheerfully. ‘They say,\n“WHY can’t fellows be allowed to do what they like WHEN they like and AS\nthey like, instead of other fellows sitting on banks and watching them\nall the time and making remarks and poetry and things about them? What\nNONSENSE it all is!” That’s what the ducks say.’\n\n‘So it is, so it is,’ said the Mole, with great heartiness.\n\n‘No, it isn’t!’ cried the Rat indignantly.\n\n‘Well then, it isn’t, it isn’t,’ replied the Mole soothingly. ‘But what\nI wanted to ask you was, won’t you take me to call on Mr. Toad? I’ve\nheard so much about him, and I do so want to make his acquaintance.’\n\n‘Why, certainly,’ said the good-natured Rat, jumping to his feet and\ndismissing poetry from his mind for the day. ‘Get the boat out, and\nwe’ll paddle up there at once. It’s never the wrong time to call on\nToad. Early or late he’s always the same fellow. Always good-tempered,\nalways glad to see you, always sorry when you go!’\n\n‘He must be a very nice animal,’ observed the Mole, as he got into the\nboat and took the sculls, while the Rat settled himself comfortably in\nthe stern.\n\n‘He is indeed the best of animals,’ replied Rat. ‘So simple, so\ngood-natured, and so affectionate. Perhaps he’s not very clever--we\ncan’t all be geniuses; and it may be that he is both boastful and\nconceited. But he has got some great qualities, has Toady.’\n\nRounding a bend in the river, they came in sight of a handsome,\ndignified old house of mellowed red brick, with well-kept lawns reaching\ndown to the water’s edge.\n\n‘There’s Toad Hall,’ said the Rat; ‘and that creek on the left, where\nthe notice-board says, “Private. No landing allowed,” leads to his\nboat-house, where we’ll leave the boat. The stables are over there to\nthe right. That’s the banqueting-hall you’re looking at now--very old,\nthat is. Toad is rather rich, you know, and this is really one of the\nnicest houses in these parts, though we never admit as much to Toad.’\n\nThey glided up the creek, and the Mole shipped his sculls as they passed\ninto the shadow of a large boat-house. Here they saw many handsome\nboats, slung from the cross beams or hauled up on a slip, but none in\nthe water; and the place had an unused and a deserted air.\n\nThe Rat looked around him. ‘I understand,’ said he. ‘Boating is played\nout. He’s tired of it, and done with it. I wonder what new fad he has\ntaken up now? Come along and let’s look him up. We shall hear all about\nit quite soon enough.’\n\nThey disembarked, and strolled across the gay flower-decked lawns in\nsearch of Toad, whom they presently happened upon resting in a wicker\ngarden-chair, with a pre-occupied expression of face, and a large map\nspread out on his knees.\n\n‘Hooray!’ he cried, jumping up on seeing them, ‘this is splendid!’ He\nshook the paws of both of them warmly, never waiting for an introduction\nto the Mole. ‘How KIND of you!’ he went on, dancing round them. ‘I was\njust going to send a boat down the river for you, Ratty, with strict\norders that you were to be fetched up here at once, whatever you were\ndoing. I want you badly--both of you. Now what will you take? Come\ninside and have something! You don’t know how lucky it is, your turning\nup just now!’\n\n‘Let’s sit quiet a bit, Toady!’ said the Rat, throwing himself into an\neasy chair, while the Mole took another by the side of him and made some\ncivil remark about Toad’s ‘delightful residence.’\n\n‘Finest house on the whole river,’ cried Toad boisterously. ‘Or anywhere\nelse, for that matter,’ he could not help adding.\n\nHere the Rat nudged the Mole. Unfortunately the Toad saw him do it, and\nturned very red. There was a moment’s painful silence. Then Toad burst\nout laughing. ‘All right, Ratty,’ he said. ‘It’s only my way, you know.\nAnd it’s not such a very bad house, is it? You know you rather like it\nyourself. Now, look here. Let’s be sensible. You are the very animals I\nwanted. You’ve got to help me. It’s most important!’\n\n‘It’s about your rowing, I suppose,’ said the Rat, with an innocent air.\n‘You’re getting on fairly well, though you splash a good bit still. With\na great deal of patience, and any quantity of coaching, you may----’\n\n‘O, pooh! boating!’ interrupted the Toad, in great disgust. Silly boyish\namusement. I’ve given that up LONG ago. Sheer waste of time, that’s what\nit is. It makes me downright sorry to see you fellows, who ought to\nknow better, spending all your energies in that aimless manner. No, I’ve\ndiscovered the real thing, the only genuine occupation for a life time.\nI propose to devote the remainder of mine to it, and can only regret the\nwasted years that lie behind me, squandered in trivialities. Come with\nme, dear Ratty, and your amiable friend also, if he will be so very\ngood, just as far as the stable-yard, and you shall see what you shall\nsee!’\n\nHe led the way to the stable-yard accordingly, the Rat following with\na most mistrustful expression; and there, drawn out of the coach house\ninto the open, they saw a gipsy caravan, shining with newness, painted a\ncanary-yellow picked out with green, and red wheels.\n\n‘There you are!’ cried the Toad, straddling and expanding himself.\n‘There’s real life for you, embodied in that little cart. The open road,\nthe dusty highway, the heath, the common, the hedgerows, the rolling\ndowns! Camps, villages, towns, cities! Here to-day, up and off to\nsomewhere else to-morrow! Travel, change, interest, excitement! The\nwhole world before you, and a horizon that’s always changing! And mind!\nthis is the very finest cart of its sort that was ever built, without\nany exception. Come inside and look at the arrangements. Planned ‘em all\nmyself, I did!’\n\nThe Mole was tremendously interested and excited, and followed him\neagerly up the steps and into the interior of the caravan. The Rat only\nsnorted and thrust his hands deep into his pockets, remaining where he\nwas.\n\nIt was indeed very compact and comfortable. Little sleeping bunks--a\nlittle table that folded up against the wall--a cooking-stove, lockers,\nbookshelves, a bird-cage with a bird in it; and pots, pans, jugs and\nkettles of every size and variety.\n\n‘All complete!’ said the Toad triumphantly, pulling open a locker. ‘You\nsee--biscuits, potted lobster, sardines--everything you can possibly\nwant. Soda-water here--baccy there--letter-paper, bacon, jam, cards and\ndominoes--you’ll find,’ he continued, as they descended the steps again,\n‘you’ll find that nothing what ever has been forgotten, when we make our\nstart this afternoon.’\n\n‘I beg your pardon,’ said the Rat slowly, as he chewed a straw, ‘but\ndid I overhear you say something about “WE,” and “START,” and “THIS\nAFTERNOON?”’\n\n‘Now, you dear good old Ratty,’ said Toad, imploringly, ‘don’t begin\ntalking in that stiff and sniffy sort of way, because you know you’ve\nGOT to come. I can’t possibly manage without you, so please consider it\nsettled, and don’t argue--it’s the one thing I can’t stand. You surely\ndon’t mean to stick to your dull fusty old river all your life, and just\nlive in a hole in a bank, and BOAT? I want to show you the world! I’m\ngoing to make an ANIMAL of you, my boy!’\n\n‘I don’t care,’ said the Rat, doggedly. ‘I’m not coming, and that’s\nflat. And I AM going to stick to my old river, AND live in a hole, AND\nboat, as I’ve always done. And what’s more, Mole’s going to stick to me\nand do as I do, aren’t you, Mole?’\n\n‘Of course I am,’ said the Mole, loyally. ‘I’ll always stick to you,\nRat, and what you say is to be--has got to be. All the same, it sounds\nas if it might have been--well, rather fun, you know!’ he added,\nwistfully. Poor Mole! The Life Adventurous was so new a thing to him,\nand so thrilling; and this fresh aspect of it was so tempting; and he\nhad fallen in love at first sight with the canary-coloured cart and all\nits little fitments.\n\nThe Rat saw what was passing in his mind, and wavered. He hated\ndisappointing people, and he was fond of the Mole, and would do almost\nanything to oblige him. Toad was watching both of them closely.\n\n‘Come along in, and have some lunch,’ he said, diplomatically, ‘and\nwe’ll talk it over. We needn’t decide anything in a hurry. Of course,\n_I_ don’t really care. I only want to give pleasure to you fellows.\n“Live for others!” That’s my motto in life.’\n\nDuring luncheon--which was excellent, of course, as everything at Toad\nHall always was--the Toad simply let himself go. Disregarding the Rat,\nhe proceeded to play upon the inexperienced Mole as on a harp. Naturally\na voluble animal, and always mastered by his imagination, he painted the\nprospects of the trip and the joys of the open life and the roadside\nin such glowing colours that the Mole could hardly sit in his chair for\nexcitement. Somehow, it soon seemed taken for granted by all three\nof them that the trip was a settled thing; and the Rat, though still\nunconvinced in his mind, allowed his good-nature to over-ride his\npersonal objections. He could not bear to disappoint his two friends,\nwho were already deep in schemes and anticipations, planning out each\nday’s separate occupation for several weeks ahead.\n\nWhen they were quite ready, the now triumphant Toad led his companions\nto the paddock and set them to capture the old grey horse, who, without\nhaving been consulted, and to his own extreme annoyance, had been told\noff by Toad for the dustiest job in this dusty expedition. He frankly\npreferred the paddock, and took a deal of catching. Meantime Toad packed\nthe lockers still tighter with necessaries, and hung nosebags, nets of\nonions, bundles of hay, and baskets from the bottom of the cart. At last\nthe horse was caught and harnessed, and they set off, all talking at\nonce, each animal either trudging by the side of the cart or sitting on\nthe shaft, as the humour took him. It was a golden afternoon. The\nsmell of the dust they kicked up was rich and satisfying; out of thick\norchards on either side the road, birds called and whistled to them\ncheerily; good-natured wayfarers, passing them, gave them ‘Good-day,’\nor stopped to say nice things about their beautiful cart; and rabbits,\nsitting at their front doors in the hedgerows, held up their fore-paws,\nand said, ‘O my! O my! O my!’\n\nLate in the evening, tired and happy and miles from home, they drew\nup on a remote common far from habitations, turned the horse loose to\ngraze, and ate their simple supper sitting on the grass by the side of\nthe cart. Toad talked big about all he was going to do in the days to\ncome, while stars grew fuller and larger all around them, and a yellow\nmoon, appearing suddenly and silently from nowhere in particular, came\nto keep them company and listen to their talk. At last they turned in to\ntheir little bunks in the cart; and Toad, kicking out his legs, sleepily\nsaid, ‘Well, good night, you fellows! This is the real life for a\ngentleman! Talk about your old river!’\n\n‘I DON’T talk about my river,’ replied the patient Rat. ‘You KNOW I\ndon’t, Toad. But I THINK about it,’ he added pathetically, in a lower\ntone: ‘I think about it--all the time!’\n\nThe Mole reached out from under his blanket, felt for the Rat’s paw in\nthe darkness, and gave it a squeeze. ‘I’ll do whatever you like, Ratty,’\nhe whispered. ‘Shall we run away to-morrow morning, quite early--VERY\nearly--and go back to our dear old hole on the river?’\n\n‘No, no, we’ll see it out,’ whispered back the Rat. ‘Thanks awfully, but\nI ought to stick by Toad till this trip is ended. It wouldn’t be safe\nfor him to be left to himself. It won’t take very long. His fads never\ndo. Good night!’\n\nThe end was indeed nearer than even the Rat suspected.\n\nAfter so much open air and excitement the Toad slept very soundly, and\nno amount of shaking could rouse him out of bed next morning. So the\nMole and Rat turned to, quietly and manfully, and while the Rat saw to\nthe horse, and lit a fire, and cleaned last night’s cups and platters,\nand got things ready for breakfast, the Mole trudged off to the nearest\nvillage, a long way off, for milk and eggs and various necessaries the\nToad had, of course, forgotten to provide. The hard work had all been\ndone, and the two animals were resting, thoroughly exhausted, by\nthe time Toad appeared on the scene, fresh and gay, remarking what a\npleasant easy life it was they were all leading now, after the cares and\nworries and fatigues of housekeeping at home.\n\nThey had a pleasant ramble that day over grassy downs and along narrow\nby-lanes, and camped as before, on a common, only this time the\ntwo guests took care that Toad should do his fair share of work. In\nconsequence, when the time came for starting next morning, Toad was by\nno means so rapturous about the simplicity of the primitive life, and\nindeed attempted to resume his place in his bunk, whence he was hauled\nby force. Their way lay, as before, across country by narrow lanes, and\nit was not till the afternoon that they came out on the high-road, their\nfirst high-road; and there disaster, fleet and unforeseen, sprang out\non them--disaster momentous indeed to their expedition, but simply\noverwhelming in its effect on the after-career of Toad.\n\nThey were strolling along the high-road easily, the Mole by the horse’s\nhead, talking to him, since the horse had complained that he was being\nfrightfully left out of it, and nobody considered him in the least;\nthe Toad and the Water Rat walking behind the cart talking together--at\nleast Toad was talking, and Rat was saying at intervals, ‘Yes,\nprecisely; and what did YOU say to HIM?’--and thinking all the time\nof something very different, when far behind them they heard a faint\nwarning hum; like the drone of a distant bee. Glancing back, they saw a\nsmall cloud of dust, with a dark centre of energy, advancing on them at\nincredible speed, while from out the dust a faint ‘Poop-poop!’ wailed\nlike an uneasy animal in pain. Hardly regarding it, they turned to\nresume their conversation, when in an instant (as it seemed) the\npeaceful scene was changed, and with a blast of wind and a whirl of\nsound that made them jump for the nearest ditch, It was on them! The\n‘Poop-poop’ rang with a brazen shout in their ears, they had a moment’s\nglimpse of an interior of glittering plate-glass and rich morocco, and\nthe magnificent motor-car, immense, breath-snatching, passionate, with\nits pilot tense and hugging his wheel, possessed all earth and air for\nthe fraction of a second, flung an enveloping cloud of dust that blinded\nand enwrapped them utterly, and then dwindled to a speck in the far\ndistance, changed back into a droning bee once more.\n\nThe old grey horse, dreaming, as he plodded along, of his quiet paddock,\nin a new raw situation such as this simply abandoned himself to his\nnatural emotions. Rearing, plunging, backing steadily, in spite of\nall the Mole’s efforts at his head, and all the Mole’s lively language\ndirected at his better feelings, he drove the cart backwards towards the\ndeep ditch at the side of the road. It wavered an instant--then there\nwas a heartrending crash--and the canary-coloured cart, their pride and\ntheir joy, lay on its side in the ditch, an irredeemable wreck.\n\nThe Rat danced up and down in the road, simply transported with passion.\n‘You villains!’ he shouted, shaking both fists, ‘You scoundrels, you\nhighwaymen, you--you--roadhogs!--I’ll have the law of you! I’ll report\nyou! I’ll take you through all the Courts!’ His home-sickness had quite\nslipped away from him, and for the moment he was the skipper of the\ncanary-coloured vessel driven on a shoal by the reckless jockeying of\nrival mariners, and he was trying to recollect all the fine and biting\nthings he used to say to masters of steam-launches when their wash, as\nthey drove too near the bank, used to flood his parlour-carpet at home.\n\nToad sat straight down in the middle of the dusty road, his legs\nstretched out before him, and stared fixedly in the direction of the\ndisappearing motor-car. He breathed short, his face wore a placid\nsatisfied expression, and at intervals he faintly murmured ‘Poop-poop!’\n\nThe Mole was busy trying to quiet the horse, which he succeeded in\ndoing after a time. Then he went to look at the cart, on its side in the\nditch. It was indeed a sorry sight. Panels and windows smashed, axles\nhopelessly bent, one wheel off, sardine-tins scattered over the wide\nworld, and the bird in the bird-cage sobbing pitifully and calling to be\nlet out.\n\nThe Rat came to help him, but their united efforts were not sufficient\nto right the cart. ‘Hi! Toad!’ they cried. ‘Come and bear a hand, can’t\nyou!’\n\nThe Toad never answered a word, or budged from his seat in the road; so\nthey went to see what was the matter with him. They found him in a sort\nof a trance, a happy smile on his face, his eyes still fixed on the\ndusty wake of their destroyer. At intervals he was still heard to murmur\n‘Poop-poop!’\n\nThe Rat shook him by the shoulder. ‘Are you coming to help us, Toad?’ he\ndemanded sternly.\n\n‘Glorious, stirring sight!’ murmured Toad, never offering to move. ‘The\npoetry of motion! The REAL way to travel! The ONLY way to travel! Here\nto-day--in next week to-morrow! Villages skipped, towns and cities\njumped--always somebody else’s horizon! O bliss! O poop-poop! O my! O\nmy!’\n\n‘O STOP being an ass, Toad!’ cried the Mole despairingly.\n\n‘And to think I never KNEW!’ went on the Toad in a dreamy monotone. ‘All\nthose wasted years that lie behind me, I never knew, never even DREAMT!\nBut NOW--but now that I know, now that I fully realise! O what a flowery\ntrack lies spread before me, henceforth! What dust-clouds shall spring\nup behind me as I speed on my reckless way! What carts I shall fling\ncarelessly into the ditch in the wake of my magnificent onset! Horrid\nlittle carts--common carts--canary-coloured carts!’\n\n‘What are we to do with him?’ asked the Mole of the Water Rat.\n\n‘Nothing at all,’ replied the Rat firmly. ‘Because there is really\nnothing to be done. You see, I know him from of old. He is now\npossessed. He has got a new craze, and it always takes him that way, in\nits first stage. He’ll continue like that for days now, like an animal\nwalking in a happy dream, quite useless for all practical purposes.\nNever mind him. Let’s go and see what there is to be done about the\ncart.’\n\nA careful inspection showed them that, even if they succeeded in\nrighting it by themselves, the cart would travel no longer. The axles\nwere in a hopeless state, and the missing wheel was shattered into\npieces.\n\nThe Rat knotted the horse’s reins over his back and took him by the\nhead, carrying the bird cage and its hysterical occupant in the other\nhand. ‘Come on!’ he said grimly to the Mole. ‘It’s five or six miles to\nthe nearest town, and we shall just have to walk it. The sooner we make\na start the better.’\n\n‘But what about Toad?’ asked the Mole anxiously, as they set off\ntogether. ‘We can’t leave him here, sitting in the middle of the road\nby himself, in the distracted state he’s in! It’s not safe. Supposing\nanother Thing were to come along?’\n\n‘O, BOTHER Toad,’ said the Rat savagely; ‘I’ve done with him!’\n\nThey had not proceeded very far on their way, however, when there was a\npattering of feet behind them, and Toad caught them up and thrust a paw\ninside the elbow of each of them; still breathing short and staring into\nvacancy.\n\n‘Now, look here, Toad!’ said the Rat sharply: ‘as soon as we get to the\ntown, you’ll have to go straight to the police-station, and see if they\nknow anything about that motor-car and who it belongs to, and lodge a\ncomplaint against it. And then you’ll have to go to a blacksmith’s or a\nwheelwright’s and arrange for the cart to be fetched and mended and\nput to rights. It’ll take time, but it’s not quite a hopeless smash.\nMeanwhile, the Mole and I will go to an inn and find comfortable rooms\nwhere we can stay till the cart’s ready, and till your nerves have\nrecovered their shock.’\n\n‘Police-station! Complaint!’ murmured Toad dreamily. ‘Me COMPLAIN of that\nbeautiful, that heavenly vision that has been vouchsafed me! MEND THE\nCART! I’ve done with carts for ever. I never want to see the cart, or to\nhear of it, again. O, Ratty! You can’t think how obliged I am to you for\nconsenting to come on this trip! I wouldn’t have gone without you,\nand then I might never have seen that--that swan, that sunbeam, that\nthunderbolt! I might never have heard that entrancing sound, or smelt\nthat bewitching smell! I owe it all to you, my best of friends!’\n\nThe Rat turned from him in despair. ‘You see what it is?’ he said to the\nMole, addressing him across Toad’s head: ‘He’s quite hopeless. I give\nit up--when we get to the town we’ll go to the railway station, and\nwith luck we may pick up a train there that’ll get us back to riverbank\nto-night. And if ever you catch me going a-pleasuring with this\nprovoking animal again!’--He snorted, and during the rest of that weary trudge addressed his\nremarks exclusively to Mole.\n\nOn reaching the town they went straight to the station and deposited\nToad in the second-class waiting-room, giving a porter twopence to keep\na strict eye on him. They then left the horse at an inn stable, and gave\nwhat directions they could about the cart and its contents. Eventually,\na slow train having landed them at a station not very far from Toad\nHall, they escorted the spell-bound, sleep-walking Toad to his door, put\nhim inside it, and instructed his housekeeper to feed him, undress him,\nand put him to bed. Then they got out their boat from the boat-house,\nsculled down the river home, and at a very late hour sat down to\nsupper in their own cosy riverside parlour, to the Rat’s great joy and\ncontentment.\n\nThe following evening the Mole, who had risen late and taken things very\neasy all day, was sitting on the bank fishing, when the Rat, who had\nbeen looking up his friends and gossiping, came strolling along to\nfind him. ‘Heard the news?’ he said. ‘There’s nothing else being talked\nabout, all along the river bank. Toad went up to Town by an early train\nthis morning. And he has ordered a large and very expensive motor-car.’\n\n\n\n\nIII. THE WILD WOOD\n\nThe Mole had long wanted to make the acquaintance of the Badger. He\nseemed, by all accounts, to be such an important personage and, though\nrarely visible, to make his unseen influence felt by everybody about\nthe place. But whenever the Mole mentioned his wish to the Water Rat\nhe always found himself put off. ‘It’s all right,’ the Rat would say.\n‘Badger’ll turn up some day or other--he’s always turning up--and then\nI’ll introduce you. The best of fellows! But you must not only take him\nAS you find him, but WHEN you find him.’\n\n‘Couldn’t you ask him here dinner or something?’ said the Mole.\n\n‘He wouldn’t come,’ replied the Rat simply. ‘Badger hates Society, and\ninvitations, and dinner, and all that sort of thing.’\n\n‘Well, then, supposing we go and call on HIM?’ suggested the Mole.\n\n‘O, I’m sure he wouldn’t like that at ALL,’ said the Rat, quite alarmed.\n‘He’s so very shy, he’d be sure to be offended. I’ve never even ventured\nto call on him at his own home myself, though I know him so well.\nBesides, we can’t. It’s quite out of the question, because he lives in\nthe very middle of the Wild Wood.’\n\n‘Well, supposing he does,’ said the Mole. ‘You told me the Wild Wood was\nall right, you know.’\n\n‘O, I know, I know, so it is,’ replied the Rat evasively. ‘But I think\nwe won’t go there just now. Not JUST yet. It’s a long way, and he\nwouldn’t be at home at this time of year anyhow, and he’ll be coming\nalong some day, if you’ll wait quietly.’\n\nThe Mole had to be content with this. But the Badger never came along,\nand every day brought its amusements, and it was not till summer was\nlong over, and cold and frost and miry ways kept them much indoors, and\nthe swollen river raced past outside their windows with a speed that\nmocked at boating of any sort or kind, that he found his thoughts\ndwelling again with much persistence on the solitary grey Badger, who\nlived his own life by himself, in his hole in the middle of the Wild\nWood.\n\nIn the winter time the Rat slept a great deal, retiring early and rising\nlate. During his short day he sometimes scribbled poetry or did other\nsmall domestic jobs about the house; and, of course, there were always\nanimals dropping in for a chat, and consequently there was a good deal\nof story-telling and comparing notes on the past summer and all its\ndoings.\n\nSuch a rich chapter it had been, when one came to look back on it all!\nWith illustrations so numerous and so very highly coloured! The pageant\nof the river bank had marched steadily along, unfolding itself in\nscene-pictures that succeeded each other in stately procession. Purple\nloosestrife arrived early, shaking luxuriant tangled locks along the\nedge of the mirror whence its own face laughed back at it. Willow-herb,\ntender and wistful, like a pink sunset cloud, was not slow to follow.\nComfrey, the purple hand-in-hand with the white, crept forth to take its\nplace in the line; and at last one morning the diffident and delaying\ndog-rose stepped delicately on the stage, and one knew, as if\nstring-music had announced it in stately chords that strayed into a\ngavotte, that June at last was here. One member of the company was still\nawaited; the shepherd-boy for the nymphs to woo, the knight for whom the\nladies waited at the window, the prince that was to kiss the sleeping\nsummer back to life and love. But when meadow-sweet, debonair and\nodorous in amber jerkin, moved graciously to his place in the group,\nthen the play was ready to begin.\n\nAnd what a play it had been! Drowsy animals, snug in their holes\nwhile wind and rain were battering at their doors, recalled still\nkeen mornings, an hour before sunrise, when the white mist, as yet\nundispersed, clung closely along the surface of the water; then the\nshock of the early plunge, the scamper along the bank, and the radiant\ntransformation of earth, air, and water, when suddenly the sun was with\nthem again, and grey was gold and colour was born and sprang out of the\nearth once more. They recalled the languorous siesta of hot mid-day,\ndeep in green undergrowth, the sun striking through in tiny golden\nshafts and spots; the boating and bathing of the afternoon, the rambles\nalong dusty lanes and through yellow cornfields; and the long, cool\nevening at last, when so many threads were gathered up, so many\nfriendships rounded, and so many adventures planned for the morrow.\nThere was plenty to talk about on those short winter days when the\nanimals found themselves round the fire; still, the Mole had a good deal\nof spare time on his hands, and so one afternoon, when the Rat in his\narm-chair before the blaze was alternately dozing and trying over rhymes\nthat wouldn’t fit, he formed the resolution to go out by himself and\nexplore the Wild Wood, and perhaps strike up an acquaintance with Mr.\nBadger.\n\nIt was a cold still afternoon with a hard steely sky overhead, when he\nslipped out of the warm parlour into the open air. The country lay bare\nand entirely leafless around him, and he thought that he had never seen\nso far and so intimately into the insides of things as on that winter\nday when Nature was deep in her annual slumber and seemed to have kicked\nthe clothes off. Copses, dells, quarries and all hidden places, which\nhad been mysterious mines for exploration in leafy summer, now exposed\nthemselves and their secrets pathetically, and seemed to ask him to\noverlook their shabby poverty for a while, till they could riot in rich\nmasquerade as before, and trick and entice him with the old deceptions.\nIt was pitiful in a way, and yet cheering--even exhilarating. He was\nglad that he liked the country undecorated, hard, and stripped of its\nfinery. He had got down to the bare bones of it, and they were fine\nand strong and simple. He did not want the warm clover and the play of\nseeding grasses; the screens of quickset, the billowy drapery of beech\nand elm seemed best away; and with great cheerfulness of spirit\nhe pushed on towards the Wild Wood, which lay before him low and\nthreatening, like a black reef in some still southern sea.\n\nThere was nothing to alarm him at first entry. Twigs crackled under his\nfeet, logs tripped him, funguses on stumps resembled caricatures, and\nstartled him for the moment by their likeness to something familiar\nand far away; but that was all fun, and exciting. It led him on, and he\npenetrated to where the light was less, and trees crouched nearer and\nnearer, and holes made ugly mouths at him on either side.\n\nEverything was very still now. The dusk advanced on him steadily,\nrapidly, gathering in behind and before; and the light seemed to be\ndraining away like flood-water.\n\nThen the faces began.\n\nIt was over his shoulder, and indistinctly, that he first thought he saw\na face; a little evil wedge-shaped face, looking out at him from a hole.\nWhen he turned and confronted it, the thing had vanished.\n\nHe quickened his pace, telling himself cheerfully not to begin imagining\nthings, or there would be simply no end to it. He passed another hole,\nand another, and another; and then--yes!--no!--yes! certainly a little\nnarrow face, with hard eyes, had flashed up for an instant from a hole,\nand was gone. He hesitated--braced himself up for an effort and strode\non. Then suddenly, and as if it had been so all the time, every hole,\nfar and near, and there were hundreds of them, seemed to possess its\nface, coming and going rapidly, all fixing on him glances of malice and\nhatred: all hard-eyed and evil and sharp.\n\nIf he could only get away from the holes in the banks, he thought,\nthere would be no more faces. He swung off the path and plunged into the\nuntrodden places of the wood.\n\nThen the whistling began.\n\nVery faint and shrill it was, and far behind him, when first he heard\nit; but somehow it made him hurry forward. Then, still very faint and\nshrill, it sounded far ahead of him, and made him hesitate and want to\ngo back. As he halted in indecision it broke out on either side, and\nseemed to be caught up and passed on throughout the whole length of the\nwood to its farthest limit. They were up and alert and ready, evidently,\nwhoever they were! And he--he was alone, and unarmed, and far from any\nhelp; and the night was closing in.\n\nThen the pattering began.\n\nHe thought it was only falling leaves at first, so slight and delicate\nwas the sound of it. Then as it grew it took a regular rhythm, and he\nknew it for nothing else but the pat-pat-pat of little feet still a very\nlong way off. Was it in front or behind? It seemed to be first one, and\nthen the other, then both. It grew and it multiplied, till from every\nquarter as he listened anxiously, leaning this way and that, it seemed\nto be closing in on him. As he stood still to hearken, a rabbit came\nrunning hard towards him through the trees. He waited, expecting it to\nslacken pace, or to swerve from him into a different course. Instead,\nthe animal almost brushed him as it dashed past, his face set and hard,\nhis eyes staring. ‘Get out of this, you fool, get out!’ the Mole heard\nhim mutter as he swung round a stump and disappeared down a friendly\nburrow.\n\nThe pattering increased till it sounded like sudden hail on the dry\nleaf-carpet spread around him. The whole wood seemed running now,\nrunning hard, hunting, chasing, closing in round something or--somebody?\nIn panic, he began to run too, aimlessly, he knew not whither. He ran\nup against things, he fell over things and into things, he darted under\nthings and dodged round things. At last he took refuge in the deep dark\nhollow of an old beech tree, which offered shelter, concealment--perhaps\neven safety, but who could tell? Anyhow, he was too tired to run any\nfurther, and could only snuggle down into the dry leaves which had\ndrifted into the hollow and hope he was safe for a time. And as he lay\nthere panting and trembling, and listened to the whistlings and the\npatterings outside, he knew it at last, in all its fullness, that dread\nthing which other little dwellers in field and hedgerow had encountered\nhere, and known as their darkest moment--that thing which the Rat had\nvainly tried to shield him from--the Terror of the Wild Wood!\n\nMeantime the Rat, warm and comfortable, dozed by his fireside. His paper\nof half-finished verses slipped from his knee, his head fell back, his\nmouth opened, and he wandered by the verdant banks of dream-rivers. Then\na coal slipped, the fire crackled and sent up a spurt of flame, and he\nwoke with a start. Remembering what he had been engaged upon, he reached\ndown to the floor for his verses, pored over them for a minute, and\nthen looked round for the Mole to ask him if he knew a good rhyme for\nsomething or other.\n\nBut the Mole was not there.\n\nHe listened for a time. The house seemed very quiet.\n\nThen he called ‘Moly!’ several times, and, receiving no answer, got up\nand went out into the hall.\n\nThe Mole’s cap was missing from its accustomed peg. His goloshes, which\nalways lay by the umbrella-stand, were also gone.\n\nThe Rat left the house, and carefully examined the muddy surface of the\nground outside, hoping to find the Mole’s tracks. There they were,\nsure enough. The goloshes were new, just bought for the winter, and the\npimples on their soles were fresh and sharp. He could see the imprints\nof them in the mud, running along straight and purposeful, leading\ndirect to the Wild Wood.\n\nThe Rat looked very grave, and stood in deep thought for a minute or\ntwo. Then he re-entered the house, strapped a belt round his waist,\nshoved a brace of pistols into it, took up a stout cudgel that stood in\na corner of the hall, and set off for the Wild Wood at a smart pace.\n\nIt was already getting towards dusk when he reached the first fringe of\ntrees and plunged without hesitation into the wood, looking anxiously\non either side for any sign of his friend. Here and there wicked little\nfaces popped out of holes, but vanished immediately at sight of the\nvalorous animal, his pistols, and the great ugly cudgel in his grasp;\nand the whistling and pattering, which he had heard quite plainly on his\nfirst entry, died away and ceased, and all was very still. He made his\nway manfully through the length of the wood, to its furthest edge; then,\nforsaking all paths, he set himself to traverse it, laboriously working\nover the whole ground, and all the time calling out cheerfully, ‘Moly,\nMoly, Moly! Where are you? It’s me--it’s old Rat!’\n\nHe had patiently hunted through the wood for an hour or more, when at\nlast to his joy he heard a little answering cry. Guiding himself by the\nsound, he made his way through the gathering darkness to the foot of\nan old beech tree, with a hole in it, and from out of the hole came a\nfeeble voice, saying ‘Ratty! Is that really you?’\n\nThe Rat crept into the hollow, and there he found the Mole, exhausted\nand still trembling. ‘O Rat!’ he cried, ‘I’ve been so frightened, you\ncan’t think!’\n\n‘O, I quite understand,’ said the Rat soothingly. ‘You shouldn’t really\nhave gone and done it, Mole. I did my best to keep you from it. We\nriver-bankers, we hardly ever come here by ourselves. If we have to\ncome, we come in couples, at least; then we’re generally all right.\nBesides, there are a hundred things one has to know, which we understand\nall about and you don’t, as yet. I mean passwords, and signs, and\nsayings which have power and effect, and plants you carry in your\npocket, and verses you repeat, and dodges and tricks you practise; all\nsimple enough when you know them, but they’ve got to be known if you’re\nsmall, or you’ll find yourself in trouble. Of course if you were Badger\nor Otter, it would be quite another matter.’\n\n‘Surely the brave Mr. Toad wouldn’t mind coming here by himself, would\nhe?’ inquired the Mole.\n\n‘Old Toad?’ said the Rat, laughing heartily. ‘He wouldn’t show his face\nhere alone, not for a whole hatful of golden guineas, Toad wouldn’t.’\n\nThe Mole was greatly cheered by the sound of the Rat’s careless\nlaughter, as well as by the sight of his stick and his gleaming pistols,\nand he stopped shivering and began to feel bolder and more himself\nagain.\n\n‘Now then,’ said the Rat presently, ‘we really must pull ourselves\ntogether and make a start for home while there’s still a little light\nleft. It will never do to spend the night here, you understand. Too\ncold, for one thing.’\n\n‘Dear Ratty,’ said the poor Mole, ‘I’m dreadfully sorry, but I’m simply\ndead beat and that’s a solid fact. You MUST let me rest here a while\nlonger, and get my strength back, if I’m to get home at all.’\n\n‘O, all right,’ said the good-natured Rat, ‘rest away. It’s pretty\nnearly pitch dark now, anyhow; and there ought to be a bit of a moon\nlater.’\n\nSo the Mole got well into the dry leaves and stretched himself out, and\npresently dropped off into sleep, though of a broken and troubled sort;\nwhile the Rat covered himself up, too, as best he might, for warmth, and\nlay patiently waiting, with a pistol in his paw.\n\nWhen at last the Mole woke up, much refreshed and in his usual spirits,\nthe Rat said, ‘Now then! I’ll just take a look outside and see if\neverything’s quiet, and then we really must be off.’\n\nHe went to the entrance of their retreat and put his head out. Then\nthe Mole heard him saying quietly to himself, ‘Hullo! hullo!\nhere--is--a--go!’\n\n‘What’s up, Ratty?’ asked the Mole.\n\n‘SNOW is up,’ replied the Rat briefly; ‘or rather, DOWN. It’s snowing\nhard.’\n\nThe Mole came and crouched beside him, and, looking out, saw the wood\nthat had been so dreadful to him in quite a changed aspect. Holes,\nhollows, pools, pitfalls, and other black menaces to the wayfarer\nwere vanishing fast, and a gleaming carpet of faery was springing up\neverywhere, that looked too delicate to be trodden upon by rough feet.\nA fine powder filled the air and caressed the cheek with a tingle in its\ntouch, and the black boles of the trees showed up in a light that seemed\nto come from below.\n\n‘Well, well, it can’t be helped,’ said the Rat, after pondering. ‘We\nmust make a start, and take our chance, I suppose. The worst of it is, I\ndon’t exactly know where we are. And now this snow makes everything look\nso very different.’\n\nIt did indeed. The Mole would not have known that it was the same\nwood. However, they set out bravely, and took the line that seemed\nmost promising, holding on to each other and pretending with invincible\ncheerfulness that they recognized an old friend in every fresh tree that\ngrimly and silently greeted them, or saw openings, gaps, or paths with\na familiar turn in them, in the monotony of white space and black\ntree-trunks that refused to vary.\n\nAn hour or two later--they had lost all count of time--they pulled\nup, dispirited, weary, and hopelessly at sea, and sat down on a fallen\ntree-trunk to recover their breath and consider what was to be done.\nThey were aching with fatigue and bruised with tumbles; they had fallen\ninto several holes and got wet through; the snow was getting so deep\nthat they could hardly drag their little legs through it, and the trees\nwere thicker and more like each other than ever. There seemed to be no\nend to this wood, and no beginning, and no difference in it, and, worst\nof all, no way out.\n\n‘We can’t sit here very long,’ said the Rat. ‘We shall have to make\nanother push for it, and do something or other. The cold is too\nawful for anything, and the snow will soon be too deep for us to wade\nthrough.’ He peered about him and considered. ‘Look here,’ he went on,\n‘this is what occurs to me. There’s a sort of dell down here in front of\nus, where the ground seems all hilly and humpy and hummocky. We’ll make\nour way down into that, and try and find some sort of shelter, a cave\nor hole with a dry floor to it, out of the snow and the wind, and there\nwe’ll have a good rest before we try again, for we’re both of us pretty\ndead beat. Besides, the snow may leave off, or something may turn up.’\n\nSo once more they got on their feet, and struggled down into the dell,\nwhere they hunted about for a cave or some corner that was dry and\na protection from the keen wind and the whirling snow. They were\ninvestigating one of the hummocky bits the Rat had spoken of, when\nsuddenly the Mole tripped up and fell forward on his face with a squeal.\n\n‘O my leg!’ he cried. ‘O my poor shin!’ and he sat up on the snow and\nnursed his leg in both his front paws.\n\n‘Poor old Mole!’ said the Rat kindly.\n\n‘You don’t seem to be having much luck to-day, do you? Let’s have a look\nat the leg. Yes,’ he went on, going down on his knees to look, ‘you’ve\ncut your shin, sure enough. Wait till I get at my handkerchief, and I’ll\ntie it up for you.’\n\n‘I must have tripped over a hidden branch or a stump,’ said the Mole\nmiserably. ‘O, my! O, my!’\n\n‘It’s a very clean cut,’ said the Rat, examining it again attentively.\n‘That was never done by a branch or a stump. Looks as if it was made\nby a sharp edge of something in metal. Funny!’ He pondered awhile, and\nexamined the humps and slopes that surrounded them.\n\n‘Well, never mind what done it,’ said the Mole, forgetting his grammar\nin his pain. ‘It hurts just the same, whatever done it.’\n\nBut the Rat, after carefully tying up the leg with his handkerchief, had\nleft him and was busy scraping in the snow. He scratched and shovelled\nand explored, all four legs working busily, while the Mole waited\nimpatiently, remarking at intervals, ‘O, COME on, Rat!’\n\nSuddenly the Rat cried ‘Hooray!’ and then ‘Hooray-oo-ray-oo-ray-oo-ray!’\nand fell to executing a feeble jig in the snow.\n\n‘What HAVE you found, Ratty?’ asked the Mole, still nursing his leg.\n\n‘Come and see!’ said the delighted Rat, as he jigged on.\n\nThe Mole hobbled up to the spot and had a good look.\n\n‘Well,’ he said at last, slowly, ‘I SEE it right enough. Seen the same\nsort of thing before, lots of times. Familiar object, I call it. A\ndoor-scraper! Well, what of it? Why dance jigs around a door-scraper?’\n\n‘But don’t you see what it MEANS, you--you dull-witted animal?’ cried\nthe Rat impatiently.\n\n‘Of course I see what it means,’ replied the Mole. ‘It simply means that\nsome VERY careless and forgetful person has left his door-scraper lying\nabout in the middle of the Wild Wood, JUST where it’s SURE to trip\nEVERYBODY up. Very thoughtless of him, I call it. When I get home\nI shall go and complain about it to--to somebody or other, see if I\ndon’t!’\n\n‘O, dear! O, dear!’ cried the Rat, in despair at his obtuseness. ‘Here,\nstop arguing and come and scrape!’ And he set to work again and made the\nsnow fly in all directions around him.\n\nAfter some further toil his efforts were rewarded, and a very shabby\ndoor-mat lay exposed to view.\n\n‘There, what did I tell you?’ exclaimed the Rat in great triumph.\n\n‘Absolutely nothing whatever,’ replied the Mole, with perfect\ntruthfulness. ‘Well now,’ he went on, ‘you seem to have found another\npiece of domestic litter, done for and thrown away, and I suppose you’re\nperfectly happy. Better go ahead and dance your jig round that if you’ve\ngot to, and get it over, and then perhaps we can go on and not waste\nany more time over rubbish-heaps. Can we EAT a doormat? or sleep under a\ndoor-mat? Or sit on a door-mat and sledge home over the snow on it, you\nexasperating rodent?’\n\n‘Do--you--mean--to--say,’ cried the excited Rat, ‘that this door-mat\ndoesn’t TELL you anything?’\n\n‘Really, Rat,’ said the Mole, quite pettishly, ‘I think we’d had enough\nof this folly. Who ever heard of a door-mat TELLING anyone anything?\nThey simply don’t do it. They are not that sort at all. Door-mats know\ntheir place.’\n\n‘Now look here, you--you thick-headed beast,’ replied the Rat, really\nangry, ‘this must stop. Not another word, but scrape--scrape and scratch\nand dig and hunt round, especially on the sides of the hummocks, if you\nwant to sleep dry and warm to-night, for it’s our last chance!’\n\nThe Rat attacked a snow-bank beside them with ardour, probing with\nhis cudgel everywhere and then digging with fury; and the Mole scraped\nbusily too, more to oblige the Rat than for any other reason, for his\nopinion was that his friend was getting light-headed.\n\nSome ten minutes’ hard work, and the point of the Rat’s cudgel struck\nsomething that sounded hollow. He worked till he could get a paw through\nand feel; then called the Mole to come and help him. Hard at it went the\ntwo animals, till at last the result of their labours stood full in view\nof the astonished and hitherto incredulous Mole.\n\nIn the side of what had seemed to be a snow-bank stood a solid-looking\nlittle door, painted a dark green. An iron bell-pull hung by the side,\nand below it, on a small brass plate, neatly engraved in square capital\nletters, they could read by the aid of moonlight MR. BADGER.\n\nThe Mole fell backwards on the snow from sheer surprise and delight.\n‘Rat!’ he cried in penitence, ‘you’re a wonder! A real wonder, that’s\nwhat you are. I see it all now! You argued it out, step by step, in that\nwise head of yours, from the very moment that I fell and cut my shin,\nand you looked at the cut, and at once your majestic mind said to\nitself, “Door-scraper!” And then you turned to and found the very\ndoor-scraper that done it! Did you stop there? No. Some people would\nhave been quite satisfied; but not you. Your intellect went on working.\n“Let me only just find a door-mat,” says you to yourself, “and my theory\nis proved!” And of course you found your door-mat. You’re so clever, I\nbelieve you could find anything you liked. “Now,” says you, “that door\nexists, as plain as if I saw it. There’s nothing else remains to be done\nbut to find it!” Well, I’ve read about that sort of thing in books, but\nI’ve never come across it before in real life. You ought to go where\nyou’ll be properly appreciated. You’re simply wasted here, among us\nfellows. If I only had your head, Ratty----’\n\n‘But as you haven’t,’ interrupted the Rat, rather unkindly, ‘I suppose\nyou’re going to sit on the snow all night and TALK? Get up at once and\nhang on to that bell-pull you see there, and ring hard, as hard as you\ncan, while I hammer!’\n\nWhile the Rat attacked the door with his stick, the Mole sprang up\nat the bell-pull, clutched it and swung there, both feet well off\nthe ground, and from quite a long way off they could faintly hear a\ndeep-toned bell respond.\n\n\n\n\nIV. MR. BADGER\n\nTHEY waited patiently for what seemed a very long time, stamping in\nthe snow to keep their feet warm. At last they heard the sound of slow\nshuffling footsteps approaching the door from the inside. It seemed, as\nthe Mole remarked to the Rat, like some one walking in carpet slippers\nthat were too large for him and down at heel; which was intelligent of\nMole, because that was exactly what it was.\n\nThere was the noise of a bolt shot back, and the door opened a few\ninches, enough to show a long snout and a pair of sleepy blinking eyes.\n\n‘Now, the VERY next time this happens,’ said a gruff and suspicious\nvoice, ‘I shall be exceedingly angry. Who is it THIS time, disturbing\npeople on such a night? Speak up!’\n\n‘Oh, Badger,’ cried the Rat, ‘let us in, please. It’s me, Rat, and my\nfriend Mole, and we’ve lost our way in the snow.’\n\n‘What, Ratty, my dear little man!’ exclaimed the Badger, in quite a\ndifferent voice. ‘Come along in, both of you, at once. Why, you must be\nperished. Well I never! Lost in the snow! And in the Wild Wood, too, and\nat this time of night! But come in with you.’\n\nThe two animals tumbled over each other in their eagerness to get\ninside, and heard the door shut behind them with great joy and relief.\n\nThe Badger, who wore a long dressing-gown, and whose slippers were\nindeed very down at heel, carried a flat candlestick in his paw and had\nprobably been on his way to bed when their summons sounded. He looked\nkindly down on them and patted both their heads. ‘This is not the sort\nof night for small animals to be out,’ he said paternally. ‘I’m afraid\nyou’ve been up to some of your pranks again, Ratty. But come along;\ncome into the kitchen. There’s a first-rate fire there, and supper and\neverything.’\n\nHe shuffled on in front of them, carrying the light, and they followed\nhim, nudging each other in an anticipating sort of way, down a long,\ngloomy, and, to tell the truth, decidedly shabby passage, into a sort of\na central hall; out of which they could dimly see other long tunnel-like\npassages branching, passages mysterious and without apparent end. But\nthere were doors in the hall as well--stout oaken comfortable-looking\ndoors. One of these the Badger flung open, and at once they found\nthemselves in all the glow and warmth of a large fire-lit kitchen.\n\nThe floor was well-worn red brick, and on the wide hearth burnt a fire\nof logs, between two attractive chimney-corners tucked away in the wall,\nwell out of any suspicion of draught. A couple of high-backed settles,\nfacing each other on either side of the fire, gave further sitting\naccommodations for the sociably disposed. In the middle of the room\nstood a long table of plain boards placed on trestles, with benches down\neach side. At one end of it, where an arm-chair stood pushed back,\nwere spread the remains of the Badger’s plain but ample supper. Rows of\nspotless plates winked from the shelves of the dresser at the far end\nof the room, and from the rafters overhead hung hams, bundles of dried\nherbs, nets of onions, and baskets of eggs. It seemed a place where\nheroes could fitly feast after victory, where weary harvesters could\nline up in scores along the table and keep their Harvest Home with mirth\nand song, or where two or three friends of simple tastes could sit about\nas they pleased and eat and smoke and talk in comfort and contentment.\nThe ruddy brick floor smiled up at the smoky ceiling; the oaken settles,\nshiny with long wear, exchanged cheerful glances with each other; plates\non the dresser grinned at pots on the shelf, and the merry firelight\nflickered and played over everything without distinction.\n\nThe kindly Badger thrust them down on a settle to toast themselves\nat the fire, and bade them remove their wet coats and boots. Then he\nfetched them dressing-gowns and slippers, and himself bathed the Mole’s\nshin with warm water and mended the cut with sticking-plaster till the\nwhole thing was just as good as new, if not better. In the embracing\nlight and warmth, warm and dry at last, with weary legs propped up in\nfront of them, and a suggestive clink of plates being arranged on\nthe table behind, it seemed to the storm-driven animals, now in safe\nanchorage, that the cold and trackless Wild Wood just left outside\nwas miles and miles away, and all that they had suffered in it a\nhalf-forgotten dream.\n\nWhen at last they were thoroughly toasted, the Badger summoned them to\nthe table, where he had been busy laying a repast. They had felt pretty\nhungry before, but when they actually saw at last the supper that was\nspread for them, really it seemed only a question of what they should\nattack first where all was so attractive, and whether the other\nthings would obligingly wait for them till they had time to give them\nattention. Conversation was impossible for a long time; and when it\nwas slowly resumed, it was that regrettable sort of conversation that\nresults from talking with your mouth full. The Badger did not mind that\nsort of thing at all, nor did he take any notice of elbows on the table,\nor everybody speaking at once. As he did not go into Society himself,\nhe had got an idea that these things belonged to the things that didn’t\nreally matter. (We know of course that he was wrong, and took too narrow\na view; because they do matter very much, though it would take too long\nto explain why.) He sat in his arm-chair at the head of the table, and\nnodded gravely at intervals as the animals told their story; and he did\nnot seem surprised or shocked at anything, and he never said, ‘I told\nyou so,’ or, ‘Just what I always said,’ or remarked that they ought to\nhave done so-and-so, or ought not to have done something else. The Mole\nbegan to feel very friendly towards him.\n\nWhen supper was really finished at last, and each animal felt that his\nskin was now as tight as was decently safe, and that by this time he\ndidn’t care a hang for anybody or anything, they gathered round the\nglowing embers of the great wood fire, and thought how jolly it was to\nbe sitting up SO late, and SO independent, and SO full; and after\nthey had chatted for a time about things in general, the Badger said\nheartily, ‘Now then! tell us the news from your part of the world. How’s\nold Toad going on?’\n\n‘Oh, from bad to worse,’ said the Rat gravely, while the Mole, cocked\nup on a settle and basking in the firelight, his heels higher than his\nhead, tried to look properly mournful. ‘Another smash-up only last week,\nand a bad one. You see, he will insist on driving himself, and he’s\nhopelessly incapable. If he’d only employ a decent, steady, well-trained\nanimal, pay him good wages, and leave everything to him, he’d get on all\nright. But no; he’s convinced he’s a heaven-born driver, and nobody can\nteach him anything; and all the rest follows.’\n\n‘How many has he had?’ inquired the Badger gloomily.\n\n‘Smashes, or machines?’ asked the Rat. ‘Oh, well, after all, it’s the\nsame thing--with Toad. This is the seventh. As for the others--you know\nthat coach-house of his? Well, it’s piled up--literally piled up to the\nroof--with fragments of motor-cars, none of them bigger than your hat!\nThat accounts for the other six--so far as they can be accounted for.’\n\n‘He’s been in hospital three times,’ put in the Mole; ‘and as for the\nfines he’s had to pay, it’s simply awful to think of.’\n\n‘Yes, and that’s part of the trouble,’ continued the Rat. ‘Toad’s rich,\nwe all know; but he’s not a millionaire. And he’s a hopelessly bad\ndriver, and quite regardless of law and order. Killed or ruined--it’s\ngot to be one of the two things, sooner or later. Badger! we’re his\nfriends--oughtn’t we to do something?’\n\nThe Badger went through a bit of hard thinking. ‘Now look here!’ he said\nat last, rather severely; ‘of course you know I can’t do anything NOW?’\n\nHis two friends assented, quite understanding his point. No animal,\naccording to the rules of animal-etiquette, is ever expected to do\nanything strenuous, or heroic, or even moderately active during the\noff-season of winter. All are sleepy--some actually asleep. All are\nweather-bound, more or less; and all are resting from arduous days and\nnights, during which every muscle in them has been severely tested, and\nevery energy kept at full stretch.\n\n‘Very well then!’ continued the Badger. ‘BUT, when once the year has\nreally turned, and the nights are shorter, and halfway through them one\nrouses and feels fidgety and wanting to be up and doing by sunrise, if\nnot before--YOU know!----’\n\nBoth animals nodded gravely. THEY knew!\n\n‘Well, THEN,’ went on the Badger, ‘we--that is, you and me and our\nfriend the Mole here--we’ll take Toad seriously in hand. We’ll stand no\nnonsense whatever. We’ll bring him back to reason, by force if need be.\nWe’ll MAKE him be a sensible Toad. We’ll--you’re asleep, Rat!’\n\n‘Not me!’ said the Rat, waking up with a jerk.\n\n‘He’s been asleep two or three times since supper,’ said the Mole,\nlaughing. He himself was feeling quite wakeful and even lively, though\nhe didn’t know why. The reason was, of course, that he being naturally\nan underground animal by birth and breeding, the situation of Badger’s\nhouse exactly suited him and made him feel at home; while the Rat, who\nslept every night in a bedroom the windows of which opened on a breezy\nriver, naturally felt the atmosphere still and oppressive.\n\n‘Well, it’s time we were all in bed,’ said the Badger, getting up and\nfetching flat candlesticks. ‘Come along, you two, and I’ll show you your\nquarters. And take your time tomorrow morning--breakfast at any hour you\nplease!’\n\nHe conducted the two animals to a long room that seemed half bedchamber\nand half loft. The Badger’s winter stores, which indeed were visible\neverywhere, took up half the room--piles of apples, turnips, and\npotatoes, baskets full of nuts, and jars of honey; but the two little\nwhite beds on the remainder of the floor looked soft and inviting, and\nthe linen on them, though coarse, was clean and smelt beautifully of\nlavender; and the Mole and the Water Rat, shaking off their garments\nin some thirty seconds, tumbled in between the sheets in great joy and\ncontentment.\n\nIn accordance with the kindly Badger’s injunctions, the two tired\nanimals came down to breakfast very late next morning, and found a\nbright fire burning in the kitchen, and two young hedgehogs sitting on\na bench at the table, eating oatmeal porridge out of wooden bowls. The\nhedgehogs dropped their spoons, rose to their feet, and ducked their\nheads respectfully as the two entered.\n\n‘There, sit down, sit down,’ said the Rat pleasantly, ‘and go on with\nyour porridge. Where have you youngsters come from? Lost your way in the\nsnow, I suppose?’\n\n‘Yes, please, sir,’ said the elder of the two hedgehogs respectfully.\n‘Me and little Billy here, we was trying to find our way to\nschool--mother WOULD have us go, was the weather ever so--and of course\nwe lost ourselves, sir, and Billy he got frightened and took and cried,\nbeing young and faint-hearted. And at last we happened up against Mr.\nBadger’s back door, and made so bold as to knock, sir, for Mr. Badger\nhe’s a kind-hearted gentleman, as everyone knows----’\n\n‘I understand,’ said the Rat, cutting himself some rashers from a side\nof bacon, while the Mole dropped some eggs into a saucepan. ‘And what’s\nthe weather like outside? You needn’t “sir” me quite so much?’ he added.\n\n‘O, terrible bad, sir, terrible deep the snow is,’ said the hedgehog.\n‘No getting out for the likes of you gentlemen to-day.’\n\n‘Where’s Mr. Badger?’ inquired the Mole, as he warmed the coffee-pot\nbefore the fire.\n\n‘The master’s gone into his study, sir,’ replied the hedgehog, ‘and he\nsaid as how he was going to be particular busy this morning, and on no\naccount was he to be disturbed.’\n\nThis explanation, of course, was thoroughly understood by every one\npresent. The fact is, as already set forth, when you live a life of\nintense activity for six months in the year, and of comparative or\nactual somnolence for the other six, during the latter period you cannot\nbe continually pleading sleepiness when there are people about or things\nto be done. The excuse gets monotonous. The animals well knew that\nBadger, having eaten a hearty breakfast, had retired to his study and\nsettled himself in an arm-chair with his legs up on another and a red\ncotton handkerchief over his face, and was being ‘busy’ in the usual way\nat this time of the year.\n\nThe front-door bell clanged loudly, and the Rat, who was very greasy\nwith buttered toast, sent Billy, the smaller hedgehog, to see who it\nmight be. There was a sound of much stamping in the hall, and presently\nBilly returned in front of the Otter, who threw himself on the Rat with\nan embrace and a shout of affectionate greeting.\n\n‘Get off!’ spluttered the Rat, with his mouth full.\n\n‘Thought I should find you here all right,’ said the Otter cheerfully.\n‘They were all in a great state of alarm along River Bank when I arrived\nthis morning. Rat never been home all night--nor Mole either--something\ndreadful must have happened, they said; and the snow had covered up all\nyour tracks, of course. But I knew that when people were in any fix they\nmostly went to Badger, or else Badger got to know of it somehow, so I\ncame straight off here, through the Wild Wood and the snow! My! it was\nfine, coming through the snow as the red sun was rising and showing\nagainst the black tree-trunks! As you went along in the stillness, every\nnow and then masses of snow slid off the branches suddenly with a flop!\nmaking you jump and run for cover. Snow-castles and snow-caverns had\nsprung up out of nowhere in the night--and snow bridges, terraces,\nramparts--I could have stayed and played with them for hours. Here and\nthere great branches had been torn away by the sheer weight of the snow,\nand robins perched and hopped on them in their perky conceited way, just\nas if they had done it themselves. A ragged string of wild geese passed\noverhead, high on the grey sky, and a few rooks whirled over the trees,\ninspected, and flapped off homewards with a disgusted expression; but I\nmet no sensible being to ask the news of. About halfway across I came on\na rabbit sitting on a stump, cleaning his silly face with his paws. He\nwas a pretty scared animal when I crept up behind him and placed a heavy\nforepaw on his shoulder. I had to cuff his head once or twice to get any\nsense out of it at all. At last I managed to extract from him that Mole\nhad been seen in the Wild Wood last night by one of them. It was the\ntalk of the burrows, he said, how Mole, Mr. Rat’s particular friend,\nwas in a bad fix; how he had lost his way, and “They” were up and out\nhunting, and were chivvying him round and round. “Then why didn’t any of\nyou DO something?” I asked. “You mayn’t be blest with brains, but there\nare hundreds and hundreds of you, big, stout fellows, as fat as butter,\nand your burrows running in all directions, and you could have taken\nhim in and made him safe and comfortable, or tried to, at all events.”\n “What, US?” he merely said: “DO something? us rabbits?” So I cuffed him\nagain and left him. There was nothing else to be done. At any rate, I\nhad learnt something; and if I had had the luck to meet any of “Them”\n I’d have learnt something more--or THEY would.’\n\n‘Weren’t you at all--er--nervous?’ asked the Mole, some of yesterday’s\nterror coming back to him at the mention of the Wild Wood.\n\n‘Nervous?’ The Otter showed a gleaming set of strong white teeth as he\nlaughed. ‘I’d give ‘em nerves if any of them tried anything on with me.\nHere, Mole, fry me some slices of ham, like the good little chap you\nare. I’m frightfully hungry, and I’ve got any amount to say to Ratty\nhere. Haven’t seen him for an age.’\n\nSo the good-natured Mole, having cut some slices of ham, set the\nhedgehogs to fry it, and returned to his own breakfast, while the Otter\nand the Rat, their heads together, eagerly talked river-shop, which is\nlong shop and talk that is endless, running on like the babbling river\nitself.\n\nA plate of fried ham had just been cleared and sent back for more, when\nthe Badger entered, yawning and rubbing his eyes, and greeted them all\nin his quiet, simple way, with kind enquiries for every one. ‘It must\nbe getting on for luncheon time,’ he remarked to the Otter. ‘Better stop\nand have it with us. You must be hungry, this cold morning.’\n\n‘Rather!’ replied the Otter, winking at the Mole. ‘The sight of these\ngreedy young hedgehogs stuffing themselves with fried ham makes me feel\npositively famished.’\n\nThe hedgehogs, who were just beginning to feel hungry again after their\nporridge, and after working so hard at their frying, looked timidly up\nat Mr. Badger, but were too shy to say anything.\n\n‘Here, you two youngsters be off home to your mother,’ said the Badger\nkindly. ‘I’ll send some one with you to show you the way. You won’t want\nany dinner to-day, I’ll be bound.’\n\nHe gave them sixpence apiece and a pat on the head, and they went off\nwith much respectful swinging of caps and touching of forelocks.\n\nPresently they all sat down to luncheon together. The Mole found himself\nplaced next to Mr. Badger, and, as the other two were still deep\nin river-gossip from which nothing could divert them, he took the\nopportunity to tell Badger how comfortable and home-like it all felt to\nhim. ‘Once well underground,’ he said, ‘you know exactly where you are.\nNothing can happen to you, and nothing can get at you. You’re entirely\nyour own master, and you don’t have to consult anybody or mind what\nthey say. Things go on all the same overhead, and you let ‘em, and don’t\nbother about ‘em. When you want to, up you go, and there the things are,\nwaiting for you.’\n\nThe Badger simply beamed on him. ‘That’s exactly what I say,’ he\nreplied. ‘There’s no security, or peace and tranquillity, except\nunderground. And then, if your ideas get larger and you want to\nexpand--why, a dig and a scrape, and there you are! If you feel your\nhouse is a bit too big, you stop up a hole or two, and there you are\nagain! No builders, no tradesmen, no remarks passed on you by fellows\nlooking over your wall, and, above all, no WEATHER. Look at Rat, now. A\ncouple of feet of flood water, and he’s got to move into hired lodgings;\nuncomfortable, inconveniently situated, and horribly expensive. Take\nToad. I say nothing against Toad Hall; quite the best house in these\nparts, AS a house. But supposing a fire breaks out--where’s Toad?\nSupposing tiles are blown off, or walls sink or crack, or windows get\nbroken--where’s Toad? Supposing the rooms are draughty--I HATE a draught\nmyself--where’s Toad? No, up and out of doors is good enough to roam\nabout and get one’s living in; but underground to come back to at\nlast--that’s my idea of HOME.’\n\nThe Mole assented heartily; and the Badger in consequence got very\nfriendly with him. ‘When lunch is over,’ he said, ‘I’ll take you all\nround this little place of mine. I can see you’ll appreciate it. You\nunderstand what domestic architecture ought to be, you do.’\n\nAfter luncheon, accordingly, when the other two had settled themselves\ninto the chimney-corner and had started a heated argument on the subject\nof EELS, the Badger lighted a lantern and bade the Mole follow him.\nCrossing the hall, they passed down one of the principal tunnels, and\nthe wavering light of the lantern gave glimpses on either side of rooms\nboth large and small, some mere cupboards, others nearly as broad and\nimposing as Toad’s dining-hall. A narrow passage at right angles led\nthem into another corridor, and here the same thing was repeated. The\nMole was staggered at the size, the extent, the ramifications of it all;\nat the length of the dim passages, the solid vaultings of the crammed\nstore-chambers, the masonry everywhere, the pillars, the arches, the\npavements. ‘How on earth, Badger,’ he said at last, ‘did you ever find\ntime and strength to do all this? It’s astonishing!’\n\n‘It WOULD be astonishing indeed,’ said the Badger simply, ‘if I HAD\ndone it. But as a matter of fact I did none of it--only cleaned out the\npassages and chambers, as far as I had need of them. There’s lots more\nof it, all round about. I see you don’t understand, and I must explain\nit to you. Well, very long ago, on the spot where the Wild Wood waves\nnow, before ever it had planted itself and grown up to what it now\nis, there was a city--a city of people, you know. Here, where we are\nstanding, they lived, and walked, and talked, and slept, and carried on\ntheir business. Here they stabled their horses and feasted, from here\nthey rode out to fight or drove out to trade. They were a powerful\npeople, and rich, and great builders. They built to last, for they\nthought their city would last for ever.’\n\n‘But what has become of them all?’ asked the Mole.\n\n‘Who can tell?’ said the Badger. ‘People come--they stay for a while,\nthey flourish, they build--and they go. It is their way. But we remain.\nThere were badgers here, I’ve been told, long before that same city ever\ncame to be. And now there are badgers here again. We are an enduring\nlot, and we may move out for a time, but we wait, and are patient, and\nback we come. And so it will ever be.’\n\n‘Well, and when they went at last, those people?’ said the Mole.\n\n‘When they went,’ continued the Badger, ‘the strong winds and persistent\nrains took the matter in hand, patiently, ceaselessly, year after year.\nPerhaps we badgers too, in our small way, helped a little--who knows?\nIt was all down, down, down, gradually--ruin and levelling and\ndisappearance. Then it was all up, up, up, gradually, as seeds grew\nto saplings, and saplings to forest trees, and bramble and fern came\ncreeping in to help. Leaf-mould rose and obliterated, streams in their\nwinter freshets brought sand and soil to clog and to cover, and in\ncourse of time our home was ready for us again, and we moved in. Up\nabove us, on the surface, the same thing happened. Animals arrived,\nliked the look of the place, took up their quarters, settled down,\nspread, and flourished. They didn’t bother themselves about the\npast--they never do; they’re too busy. The place was a bit humpy\nand hillocky, naturally, and full of holes; but that was rather an\nadvantage. And they don’t bother about the future, either--the future\nwhen perhaps the people will move in again--for a time--as may very well\nbe. The Wild Wood is pretty well populated by now; with all the usual\nlot, good, bad, and indifferent--I name no names. It takes all sorts to\nmake a world. But I fancy you know something about them yourself by this\ntime.’\n\n‘I do indeed,’ said the Mole, with a slight shiver.\n\n‘Well, well,’ said the Badger, patting him on the shoulder, ‘it was your\nfirst experience of them, you see. They’re not so bad really; and we\nmust all live and let live. But I’ll pass the word around to-morrow, and\nI think you’ll have no further trouble. Any friend of MINE walks where\nhe likes in this country, or I’ll know the reason why!’\n\nWhen they got back to the kitchen again, they found the Rat walking up\nand down, very restless. The underground atmosphere was oppressing him\nand getting on his nerves, and he seemed really to be afraid that the\nriver would run away if he wasn’t there to look after it. So he had his\novercoat on, and his pistols thrust into his belt again. ‘Come along,\nMole,’ he said anxiously, as soon as he caught sight of them. ‘We must\nget off while it’s daylight. Don’t want to spend another night in the\nWild Wood again.’\n\n‘It’ll be all right, my fine fellow,’ said the Otter. ‘I’m coming along\nwith you, and I know every path blindfold; and if there’s a head that\nneeds to be punched, you can confidently rely upon me to punch it.’\n\n‘You really needn’t fret, Ratty,’ added the Badger placidly. ‘My\npassages run further than you think, and I’ve bolt-holes to the edge\nof the wood in several directions, though I don’t care for everybody to\nknow about them. When you really have to go, you shall leave by one of\nmy short cuts. Meantime, make yourself easy, and sit down again.’\n\nThe Rat was nevertheless still anxious to be off and attend to his\nriver, so the Badger, taking up his lantern again, led the way along a\ndamp and airless tunnel that wound and dipped, part vaulted, part hewn\nthrough solid rock, for a weary distance that seemed to be miles. At\nlast daylight began to show itself confusedly through tangled growth\noverhanging the mouth of the passage; and the Badger, bidding them\na hasty good-bye, pushed them hurriedly through the opening, made\neverything look as natural as possible again, with creepers, brushwood,\nand dead leaves, and retreated.\n\nThey found themselves standing on the very edge of the Wild Wood. Rocks\nand brambles and tree-roots behind them, confusedly heaped and tangled;\nin front, a great space of quiet fields, hemmed by lines of hedges black\non the snow, and, far ahead, a glint of the familiar old river, while\nthe wintry sun hung red and low on the horizon. The Otter, as knowing\nall the paths, took charge of the party, and they trailed out on a\nbee-line for a distant stile. Pausing there a moment and looking back,\nthey saw the whole mass of the Wild Wood, dense, menacing, compact,\ngrimly set in vast white surroundings; simultaneously they turned and\nmade swiftly for home, for firelight and the familiar things it played\non, for the voice, sounding cheerily outside their window, of the river\nthat they knew and trusted in all its moods, that never made them afraid\nwith any amazement.\n\nAs he hurried along, eagerly anticipating the moment when he would be at\nhome again among the things he knew and liked, the Mole saw clearly that\nhe was an animal of tilled field and hedge-row, linked to the ploughed\nfurrow, the frequented pasture, the lane of evening lingerings,\nthe cultivated garden-plot. For others the asperities, the stubborn\nendurance, or the clash of actual conflict, that went with Nature in the\nrough; he must be wise, must keep to the pleasant places in which his\nlines were laid and which held adventure enough, in their way, to last\nfor a lifetime.\n\n\n\n\nV. DULCE DOMUM\n\nThe sheep ran huddling together against the hurdles, blowing out thin\nnostrils and stamping with delicate fore-feet, their heads thrown back\nand a light steam rising from the crowded sheep-pen into the frosty air,\nas the two animals hastened by in high spirits, with much chatter and\nlaughter. They were returning across country after a long day’s outing\nwith Otter, hunting and exploring on the wide uplands where certain\nstreams tributary to their own River had their first small beginnings;\nand the shades of the short winter day were closing in on them, and they\nhad still some distance to go. Plodding at random across the plough,\nthey had heard the sheep and had made for them; and now, leading from\nthe sheep-pen, they found a beaten track that made walking a lighter\nbusiness, and responded, moreover, to that small inquiring something\nwhich all animals carry inside them, saying unmistakably, ‘Yes, quite\nright; THIS leads home!’\n\n‘It looks as if we were coming to a village,’ said the Mole somewhat\ndubiously, slackening his pace, as the track, that had in time become\na path and then had developed into a lane, now handed them over to the\ncharge of a well-metalled road. The animals did not hold with villages,\nand their own highways, thickly frequented as they were, took an\nindependent course, regardless of church, post office, or public-house.\n\n‘Oh, never mind!’ said the Rat. ‘At this season of the year they’re\nall safe indoors by this time, sitting round the fire; men, women,\nand children, dogs and cats and all. We shall slip through all right,\nwithout any bother or unpleasantness, and we can have a look at them\nthrough their windows if you like, and see what they’re doing.’\n\nThe rapid nightfall of mid-December had quite beset the little village\nas they approached it on soft feet over a first thin fall of powdery\nsnow. Little was visible but squares of a dusky orange-red on either\nside of the street, where the firelight or lamplight of each cottage\noverflowed through the casements into the dark world without. Most of\nthe low latticed windows were innocent of blinds, and to the lookers-in\nfrom outside, the inmates, gathered round the tea-table, absorbed in\nhandiwork, or talking with laughter and gesture, had each that happy\ngrace which is the last thing the skilled actor shall capture--the\nnatural grace which goes with perfect unconsciousness of observation.\nMoving at will from one theatre to another, the two spectators, so far\nfrom home themselves, had something of wistfulness in their eyes as they\nwatched a cat being stroked, a sleepy child picked up and huddled off\nto bed, or a tired man stretch and knock out his pipe on the end of a\nsmouldering log.\n\nBut it was from one little window, with its blind drawn down, a mere\nblank transparency on the night, that the sense of home and the little\ncurtained world within walls--the larger stressful world of outside\nNature shut out and forgotten--most pulsated. Close against the white\nblind hung a bird-cage, clearly silhouetted, every wire, perch, and\nappurtenance distinct and recognisable, even to yesterday’s dull-edged\nlump of sugar. On the middle perch the fluffy occupant, head tucked well\ninto feathers, seemed so near to them as to be easily stroked, had\nthey tried; even the delicate tips of his plumped-out plumage pencilled\nplainly on the illuminated screen. As they looked, the sleepy little\nfellow stirred uneasily, woke, shook himself, and raised his head. They\ncould see the gape of his tiny beak as he yawned in a bored sort of way,\nlooked round, and then settled his head into his back again, while the\nruffled feathers gradually subsided into perfect stillness. Then a\ngust of bitter wind took them in the back of the neck, a small sting of\nfrozen sleet on the skin woke them as from a dream, and they knew their\ntoes to be cold and their legs tired, and their own home distant a weary\nway.\n\nOnce beyond the village, where the cottages ceased abruptly, on either\nside of the road they could smell through the darkness the friendly\nfields again; and they braced themselves for the last long stretch, the\nhome stretch, the stretch that we know is bound to end, some time, in\nthe rattle of the door-latch, the sudden firelight, and the sight of\nfamiliar things greeting us as long-absent travellers from far over-sea.\nThey plodded along steadily and silently, each of them thinking his own\nthoughts. The Mole’s ran a good deal on supper, as it was pitch-dark,\nand it was all a strange country for him as far as he knew, and he\nwas following obediently in the wake of the Rat, leaving the guidance\nentirely to him. As for the Rat, he was walking a little way ahead, as\nhis habit was, his shoulders humped, his eyes fixed on the straight grey\nroad in front of him; so he did not notice poor Mole when suddenly the\nsummons reached him, and took him like an electric shock.\n\nWe others, who have long lost the more subtle of the physical senses,\nhave not even proper terms to express an animal’s inter-communications\nwith his surroundings, living or otherwise, and have only the word\n‘smell,’ for instance, to include the whole range of delicate thrills\nwhich murmur in the nose of the animal night and day, summoning,\nwarning, inciting, repelling. It was one of these mysterious fairy calls\nfrom out the void that suddenly reached Mole in the darkness, making him\ntingle through and through with its very familiar appeal, even while\nyet he could not clearly remember what it was. He stopped dead in\nhis tracks, his nose searching hither and thither in its efforts to\nrecapture the fine filament, the telegraphic current, that had so\nstrongly moved him. A moment, and he had caught it again; and with it\nthis time came recollection in fullest flood.\n\nHome! That was what they meant, those caressing appeals, those soft\ntouches wafted through the air, those invisible little hands pulling and\ntugging, all one way! Why, it must be quite close by him at that moment,\nhis old home that he had hurriedly forsaken and never sought again, that\nday when he first found the river! And now it was sending out its scouts\nand its messengers to capture him and bring him in. Since his escape on\nthat bright morning he had hardly given it a thought, so absorbed had he\nbeen in his new life, in all its pleasures, its surprises, its fresh and\ncaptivating experiences. Now, with a rush of old memories, how clearly\nit stood up before him, in the darkness! Shabby indeed, and small and\npoorly furnished, and yet his, the home he had made for himself, the\nhome he had been so happy to get back to after his day’s work. And the\nhome had been happy with him, too, evidently, and was missing him, and\nwanted him back, and was telling him so, through his nose, sorrowfully,\nreproachfully, but with no bitterness or anger; only with plaintive\nreminder that it was there, and wanted him.\n\nThe call was clear, the summons was plain. He must obey it instantly,\nand go. ‘Ratty!’ he called, full of joyful excitement, ‘hold on! Come\nback! I want you, quick!’\n\n‘Oh, COME along, Mole, do!’ replied the Rat cheerfully, still plodding\nalong.\n\n‘PLEASE stop, Ratty!’ pleaded the poor Mole, in anguish of heart. ‘You\ndon’t understand! It’s my home, my old home! I’ve just come across the\nsmell of it, and it’s close by here, really quite close. And I MUST go\nto it, I must, I must! Oh, come back, Ratty! Please, please come back!’\n\nThe Rat was by this time very far ahead, too far to hear clearly what\nthe Mole was calling, too far to catch the sharp note of painful appeal\nin his voice. And he was much taken up with the weather, for he too\ncould smell something--something suspiciously like approaching snow.\n\n‘Mole, we mustn’t stop now, really!’ he called back. ‘We’ll come for\nit to-morrow, whatever it is you’ve found. But I daren’t stop now--it’s\nlate, and the snow’s coming on again, and I’m not sure of the way! And I\nwant your nose, Mole, so come on quick, there’s a good fellow!’ And the\nRat pressed forward on his way without waiting for an answer.\n\nPoor Mole stood alone in the road, his heart torn asunder, and a big sob\ngathering, gathering, somewhere low down inside him, to leap up to the\nsurface presently, he knew, in passionate escape. But even under such\na test as this his loyalty to his friend stood firm. Never for a moment\ndid he dream of abandoning him. Meanwhile, the wafts from his old home\npleaded, whispered, conjured, and finally claimed him imperiously. He\ndared not tarry longer within their magic circle. With a wrench that\ntore his very heartstrings he set his face down the road and followed\nsubmissively in the track of the Rat, while faint, thin little smells,\nstill dogging his retreating nose, reproached him for his new friendship\nand his callous forgetfulness.\n\nWith an effort he caught up to the unsuspecting Rat, who began\nchattering cheerfully about what they would do when they got back, and\nhow jolly a fire of logs in the parlour would be, and what a supper he\nmeant to eat; never noticing his companion’s silence and distressful\nstate of mind. At last, however, when they had gone some considerable\nway further, and were passing some tree-stumps at the edge of a copse\nthat bordered the road, he stopped and said kindly, ‘Look here, Mole old\nchap, you seem dead tired. No talk left in you, and your feet dragging\nlike lead. We’ll sit down here for a minute and rest. The snow has held\noff so far, and the best part of our journey is over.’\n\nThe Mole subsided forlornly on a tree-stump and tried to control\nhimself, for he felt it surely coming. The sob he had fought with so\nlong refused to be beaten. Up and up, it forced its way to the air, and\nthen another, and another, and others thick and fast; till poor Mole at\nlast gave up the struggle, and cried freely and helplessly and openly,\nnow that he knew it was all over and he had lost what he could hardly be\nsaid to have found.\n\nThe Rat, astonished and dismayed at the violence of Mole’s paroxysm of\ngrief, did not dare to speak for a while. At last he said, very quietly\nand sympathetically, ‘What is it, old fellow? Whatever can be the\nmatter? Tell us your trouble, and let me see what I can do.’\n\nPoor Mole found it difficult to get any words out between the upheavals\nof his chest that followed one upon another so quickly and held back\nspeech and choked it as it came. ‘I know it’s a--shabby, dingy little\nplace,’ he sobbed forth at last, brokenly: ‘not like--your cosy\nquarters--or Toad’s beautiful hall--or Badger’s great house--but it was\nmy own little home--and I was fond of it--and I went away and forgot all\nabout it--and then I smelt it suddenly--on the road, when I called\nand you wouldn’t listen, Rat--and everything came back to me with a\nrush--and I WANTED it!--O dear, O dear!--and when you WOULDN’T turn\nback, Ratty--and I had to leave it, though I was smelling it all the\ntime--I thought my heart would break.--We might have just gone and had\none look at it, Ratty--only one look--it was close by--but you wouldn’t\nturn back, Ratty, you wouldn’t turn back! O dear, O dear!’\n\nRecollection brought fresh waves of sorrow, and sobs again took full\ncharge of him, preventing further speech.\n\nThe Rat stared straight in front of him, saying nothing, only patting\nMole gently on the shoulder. After a time he muttered gloomily, ‘I see\nit all now! What a PIG I have been! A pig--that’s me! Just a pig--a\nplain pig!’\n\nHe waited till Mole’s sobs became gradually less stormy and more\nrhythmical; he waited till at last sniffs were frequent and sobs only\nintermittent. Then he rose from his seat, and, remarking carelessly,\n‘Well, now we’d really better be getting on, old chap!’ set off up the\nroad again, over the toilsome way they had come.\n\n‘Wherever are you (hic) going to (hic), Ratty?’ cried the tearful Mole,\nlooking up in alarm.\n\n‘We’re going to find that home of yours, old fellow,’ replied the\nRat pleasantly; ‘so you had better come along, for it will take some\nfinding, and we shall want your nose.’\n\n‘Oh, come back, Ratty, do!’ cried the Mole, getting up and hurrying\nafter him. ‘It’s no good, I tell you! It’s too late, and too dark, and\nthe place is too far off, and the snow’s coming! And--and I never meant\nto let you know I was feeling that way about it--it was all an accident\nand a mistake! And think of River Bank, and your supper!’\n\n‘Hang River Bank, and supper too!’ said the Rat heartily. ‘I tell you,\nI’m going to find this place now, if I stay out all night. So cheer up,\nold chap, and take my arm, and we’ll very soon be back there again.’\n\nStill snuffling, pleading, and reluctant, Mole suffered himself to be\ndragged back along the road by his imperious companion, who by a flow of\ncheerful talk and anecdote endeavoured to beguile his spirits back and\nmake the weary way seem shorter. When at last it seemed to the Rat that\nthey must be nearing that part of the road where the Mole had been ‘held\nup,’ he said, ‘Now, no more talking. Business! Use your nose, and give\nyour mind to it.’\n\nThey moved on in silence for some little way, when suddenly the Rat was\nconscious, through his arm that was linked in Mole’s, of a faint sort of\nelectric thrill that was passing down that animal’s body. Instantly he\ndisengaged himself, fell back a pace, and waited, all attention.\n\nThe signals were coming through!\n\nMole stood a moment rigid, while his uplifted nose, quivering slightly,\nfelt the air.\n\nThen a short, quick run forward--a fault--a check--a try back; and then\na slow, steady, confident advance.\n\nThe Rat, much excited, kept close to his heels as the Mole, with\nsomething of the air of a sleep-walker, crossed a dry ditch, scrambled\nthrough a hedge, and nosed his way over a field open and trackless and\nbare in the faint starlight.\n\nSuddenly, without giving warning, he dived; but the Rat was on the\nalert, and promptly followed him down the tunnel to which his unerring\nnose had faithfully led him.\n\nIt was close and airless, and the earthy smell was strong, and it seemed\na long time to Rat ere the passage ended and he could stand erect and\nstretch and shake himself. The Mole struck a match, and by its light\nthe Rat saw that they were standing in an open space, neatly swept and\nsanded underfoot, and directly facing them was Mole’s little front door,\nwith ‘Mole End’ painted, in Gothic lettering, over the bell-pull at the\nside.\n\nMole reached down a lantern from a nail on the wall and lit it... and the\nRat, looking round him, saw that they were in a sort of fore-court. A\ngarden-seat stood on one side of the door, and on the other a roller;\nfor the Mole, who was a tidy animal when at home, could not stand having\nhis ground kicked up by other animals into little runs that ended\nin earth-heaps. On the walls hung wire baskets with ferns in them,\nalternating with brackets carrying plaster statuary--Garibaldi, and the\ninfant Samuel, and Queen Victoria, and other heroes of modern Italy.\nDown on one side of the forecourt ran a skittle-alley, with benches\nalong it and little wooden tables marked with rings that hinted at\nbeer-mugs. In the middle was a small round pond containing gold-fish and\nsurrounded by a cockle-shell border. Out of the centre of the pond rose\na fanciful erection clothed in more cockle-shells and topped by a large\nsilvered glass ball that reflected everything all wrong and had a very\npleasing effect.\n\nMole’s face-beamed at the sight of all these objects so dear to him, and\nhe hurried Rat through the door, lit a lamp in the hall, and took one\nglance round his old home. He saw the dust lying thick on everything,\nsaw the cheerless, deserted look of the long-neglected house, and its\nnarrow, meagre dimensions, its worn and shabby contents--and collapsed\nagain on a hall-chair, his nose to his paws. ‘O Ratty!’ he cried\ndismally, ‘why ever did I do it? Why did I bring you to this poor, cold\nlittle place, on a night like this, when you might have been at River\nBank by this time, toasting your toes before a blazing fire, with all\nyour own nice things about you!’\n\nThe Rat paid no heed to his doleful self-reproaches. He was running here\nand there, opening doors, inspecting rooms and cupboards, and lighting\nlamps and candles and sticking them, up everywhere. ‘What a capital\nlittle house this is!’ he called out cheerily. ‘So compact! So well\nplanned! Everything here and everything in its place! We’ll make a jolly\nnight of it. The first thing we want is a good fire; I’ll see to that--I\nalways know where to find things. So this is the parlour? Splendid! Your\nown idea, those little sleeping-bunks in the wall? Capital! Now, I’ll\nfetch the wood and the coals, and you get a duster, Mole--you’ll find\none in the drawer of the kitchen table--and try and smarten things up a\nbit. Bustle about, old chap!’\n\nEncouraged by his inspiriting companion, the Mole roused himself and\ndusted and polished with energy and heartiness, while the Rat, running\nto and fro with armfuls of fuel, soon had a cheerful blaze roaring\nup the chimney. He hailed the Mole to come and warm himself; but Mole\npromptly had another fit of the blues, dropping down on a couch in dark\ndespair and burying his face in his duster. ‘Rat,’ he moaned, ‘how about\nyour supper, you poor, cold, hungry, weary animal? I’ve nothing to give\nyou--nothing--not a crumb!’\n\n‘What a fellow you are for giving in!’ said the Rat reproachfully.\n‘Why, only just now I saw a sardine-opener on the kitchen dresser, quite\ndistinctly; and everybody knows that means there are sardines about\nsomewhere in the neighbourhood. Rouse yourself! pull yourself together,\nand come with me and forage.’\n\nThey went and foraged accordingly, hunting through every cupboard and\nturning out every drawer. The result was not so very depressing after\nall, though of course it might have been better; a tin of sardines--a\nbox of captain’s biscuits, nearly full--and a German sausage encased in\nsilver paper.\n\n‘There’s a banquet for you!’ observed the Rat, as he arranged the table.\n‘I know some animals who would give their ears to be sitting down to\nsupper with us to-night!’\n\n‘No bread!’ groaned the Mole dolorously; ‘no butter, no----’\n\n‘No pate de foie gras, no champagne!’ continued the Rat, grinning. ‘And\nthat reminds me--what’s that little door at the end of the passage? Your\ncellar, of course! Every luxury in this house! Just you wait a minute.’\n\nHe made for the cellar-door, and presently reappeared, somewhat\ndusty, with a bottle of beer in each paw and another under each arm,\n‘Self-indulgent beggar you seem to be, Mole,’ he observed. ‘Deny\nyourself nothing. This is really the jolliest little place I ever was\nin. Now, wherever did you pick up those prints? Make the place look so\nhome-like, they do. No wonder you’re so fond of it, Mole. Tell us all\nabout it, and how you came to make it what it is.’\n\nThen, while the Rat busied himself fetching plates, and knives and\nforks, and mustard which he mixed in an egg-cup, the Mole, his bosom\nstill heaving with the stress of his recent emotion, related--somewhat\nshyly at first, but with more freedom as he warmed to his subject--how\nthis was planned, and how that was thought out, and how this was got\nthrough a windfall from an aunt, and that was a wonderful find and a\nbargain, and this other thing was bought out of laborious savings and a\ncertain amount of ‘going without.’ His spirits finally quite restored,\nhe must needs go and caress his possessions, and take a lamp and show\noff their points to his visitor and expatiate on them, quite forgetful\nof the supper they both so much needed; Rat, who was desperately hungry\nbut strove to conceal it, nodding seriously, examining with a puckered\nbrow, and saying, ‘wonderful,’ and ‘most remarkable,’ at intervals, when\nthe chance for an observation was given him.\n\nAt last the Rat succeeded in decoying him to the table, and had just got\nseriously to work with the sardine-opener when sounds were heard from\nthe fore-court without--sounds like the scuffling of small feet in the\ngravel and a confused murmur of tiny voices, while broken sentences\nreached them--‘Now, all in a line--hold the lantern up a bit,\nTommy--clear your throats first--no coughing after I say one, two,\nthree.--Where’s young Bill?--Here, come on, do, we’re all a-waiting----’\n\n‘What’s up?’ inquired the Rat, pausing in his labours.\n\n‘I think it must be the field-mice,’ replied the Mole, with a touch of\npride in his manner. ‘They go round carol-singing regularly at this time\nof the year. They’re quite an institution in these parts. And they never\npass me over--they come to Mole End last of all; and I used to give them\nhot drinks, and supper too sometimes, when I could afford it. It will be\nlike old times to hear them again.’\n\n‘Let’s have a look at them!’ cried the Rat, jumping up and running to\nthe door.\n\nIt was a pretty sight, and a seasonable one, that met their eyes when\nthey flung the door open. In the fore-court, lit by the dim rays of a\nhorn lantern, some eight or ten little fieldmice stood in a semicircle,\nred worsted comforters round their throats, their fore-paws thrust deep\ninto their pockets, their feet jigging for warmth. With bright beady\neyes they glanced shyly at each other, sniggering a little, sniffing and\napplying coat-sleeves a good deal. As the door opened, one of the elder\nones that carried the lantern was just saying, ‘Now then, one, two,\nthree!’ and forthwith their shrill little voices uprose on the air,\nsinging one of the old-time carols that their forefathers composed in\nfields that were fallow and held by frost, or when snow-bound in chimney\ncorners, and handed down to be sung in the miry street to lamp-lit\nwindows at Yule-time.\n\n\n                      CAROL\n\n          Villagers all, this frosty tide,\n          Let your doors swing open wide,\n          Though wind may follow, and snow beside,\n           Yet draw us in by your fire to bide;\n             Joy shall be yours in the morning!\n\n          Here we stand in the cold and the sleet,\n          Blowing fingers and stamping feet,\n          Come from far away you to greet--\n           You by the fire and we in the street--\n            Bidding you joy in the morning!\n\n          For ere one half of the night was gone,\n          Sudden a star has led us on,\n          Raining bliss and benison--\n           Bliss to-morrow and more anon,\n            Joy for every morning!\n\n          Goodman Joseph toiled through the snow--\n          Saw the star o’er a stable low;\n          Mary she might not further go--\n           Welcome thatch, and litter below!\n            Joy was hers in the morning!\n\n          And then they heard the angels tell\n          ‘Who were the first to cry NOWELL?\n          Animals all, as it befell,\n           In the stable where they did dwell!\n            Joy shall be theirs in the morning!’\n\n\nThe voices ceased, the singers, bashful but smiling, exchanged sidelong\nglances, and silence succeeded--but for a moment only. Then, from up\nabove and far away, down the tunnel they had so lately travelled was\nborne to their ears in a faint musical hum the sound of distant bells\nringing a joyful and clangorous peal.\n\n‘Very well sung, boys!’ cried the Rat heartily. ‘And now come along in,\nall of you, and warm yourselves by the fire, and have something hot!’\n\n‘Yes, come along, field-mice,’ cried the Mole eagerly. ‘This is quite\nlike old times! Shut the door after you. Pull up that settle to the\nfire. Now, you just wait a minute, while we--O, Ratty!’ he cried in\ndespair, plumping down on a seat, with tears impending. ‘Whatever are we\ndoing? We’ve nothing to give them!’\n\n‘You leave all that to me,’ said the masterful Rat. ‘Here, you with the\nlantern! Come over this way. I want to talk to you. Now, tell me, are\nthere any shops open at this hour of the night?’\n\n‘Why, certainly, sir,’ replied the field-mouse respectfully. ‘At this\ntime of the year our shops keep open to all sorts of hours.’\n\n‘Then look here!’ said the Rat. ‘You go off at once, you and your\nlantern, and you get me----’\n\nHere much muttered conversation ensued, and the Mole only heard bits\nof it, such as--‘Fresh, mind!--no, a pound of that will do--see you get\nBuggins’s, for I won’t have any other--no, only the best--if you can’t\nget it there, try somewhere else--yes, of course, home-made, no tinned\nstuff--well then, do the best you can!’ Finally, there was a chink of\ncoin passing from paw to paw, the field-mouse was provided with an ample\nbasket for his purchases, and off he hurried, he and his lantern.\n\nThe rest of the field-mice, perched in a row on the settle, their small\nlegs swinging, gave themselves up to enjoyment of the fire, and toasted\ntheir chilblains till they tingled; while the Mole, failing to draw them\ninto easy conversation, plunged into family history and made each of\nthem recite the names of his numerous brothers, who were too young,\nit appeared, to be allowed to go out a-carolling this year, but looked\nforward very shortly to winning the parental consent.\n\nThe Rat, meanwhile, was busy examining the label on one of the\nbeer-bottles. ‘I perceive this to be Old Burton,’ he remarked\napprovingly. ‘SENSIBLE Mole! The very thing! Now we shall be able to\nmull some ale! Get the things ready, Mole, while I draw the corks.’\n\nIt did not take long to prepare the brew and thrust the tin heater well\ninto the red heart of the fire; and soon every field-mouse was sipping\nand coughing and choking (for a little mulled ale goes a long way) and\nwiping his eyes and laughing and forgetting he had ever been cold in all\nhis life.\n\n‘They act plays too, these fellows,’ the Mole explained to the Rat.\n‘Make them up all by themselves, and act them afterwards. And very\nwell they do it, too! They gave us a capital one last year, about a\nfield-mouse who was captured at sea by a Barbary corsair, and made to\nrow in a galley; and when he escaped and got home again, his lady-love\nhad gone into a convent. Here, YOU! You were in it, I remember. Get up\nand recite a bit.’\n\nThe field-mouse addressed got up on his legs, giggled shyly, looked\nround the room, and remained absolutely tongue-tied. His comrades\ncheered him on, Mole coaxed and encouraged him, and the Rat went so\nfar as to take him by the shoulders and shake him; but nothing could\novercome his stage-fright. They were all busily engaged on him like\nwatermen applying the Royal Humane Society’s regulations to a case\nof long submersion, when the latch clicked, the door opened, and the\nfield-mouse with the lantern reappeared, staggering under the weight of\nhis basket.\n\nThere was no more talk of play-acting once the very real and solid\ncontents of the basket had been tumbled out on the table. Under the\ngeneralship of Rat, everybody was set to do something or to fetch\nsomething. In a very few minutes supper was ready, and Mole, as he took\nthe head of the table in a sort of a dream, saw a lately barren board\nset thick with savoury comforts; saw his little friends’ faces brighten\nand beam as they fell to without delay; and then let himself loose--for\nhe was famished indeed--on the provender so magically provided, thinking\nwhat a happy home-coming this had turned out, after all. As they ate,\nthey talked of old times, and the field-mice gave him the local gossip\nup to date, and answered as well as they could the hundred questions he\nhad to ask them. The Rat said little or nothing, only taking care that\neach guest had what he wanted, and plenty of it, and that Mole had no\ntrouble or anxiety about anything.\n\nThey clattered off at last, very grateful and showering wishes of the\nseason, with their jacket pockets stuffed with remembrances for the\nsmall brothers and sisters at home. When the door had closed on the last\nof them and the chink of the lanterns had died away, Mole and Rat kicked\nthe fire up, drew their chairs in, brewed themselves a last nightcap of\nmulled ale, and discussed the events of the long day. At last the Rat,\nwith a tremendous yawn, said, ‘Mole, old chap, I’m ready to drop. Sleepy\nis simply not the word. That your own bunk over on that side? Very well,\nthen, I’ll take this. What a ripping little house this is! Everything so\nhandy!’\n\nHe clambered into his bunk and rolled himself well up in the blankets,\nand slumber gathered him forthwith, as a swathe of barley is folded into\nthe arms of the reaping machine.\n\nThe weary Mole also was glad to turn in without delay, and soon had his\nhead on his pillow, in great joy and contentment. But ere he closed his\neyes he let them wander round his old room, mellow in the glow of the\nfirelight that played or rested on familiar and friendly things which\nhad long been unconsciously a part of him, and now smilingly received\nhim back, without rancour. He was now in just the frame of mind that the\ntactful Rat had quietly worked to bring about in him. He saw clearly how\nplain and simple--how narrow, even--it all was; but clearly, too, how\nmuch it all meant to him, and the special value of some such anchorage\nin one’s existence. He did not at all want to abandon the new life\nand its splendid spaces, to turn his back on sun and air and all they\noffered him and creep home and stay there; the upper world was all too\nstrong, it called to him still, even down there, and he knew he must\nreturn to the larger stage. But it was good to think he had this to come\nback to; this place which was all his own, these things which were so\nglad to see him again and could always be counted upon for the same\nsimple welcome.\n\n\n\n\nVI. MR. TOAD\n\nIt was a bright morning in the early part of summer; the river had\nresumed its wonted banks and its accustomed pace, and a hot sun seemed\nto be pulling everything green and bushy and spiky up out of the earth\ntowards him, as if by strings. The Mole and the Water Rat had been up\nsince dawn, very busy on matters connected with boats and the opening of\nthe boating season; painting and varnishing, mending paddles, repairing\ncushions, hunting for missing boat-hooks, and so on; and were finishing\nbreakfast in their little parlour and eagerly discussing their plans for\nthe day, when a heavy knock sounded at the door.\n\n‘Bother!’ said the Rat, all over egg. ‘See who it is, Mole, like a good\nchap, since you’ve finished.’\n\nThe Mole went to attend the summons, and the Rat heard him utter a cry\nof surprise. Then he flung the parlour door open, and announced with\nmuch importance, ‘Mr. Badger!’\n\nThis was a wonderful thing, indeed, that the Badger should pay a formal\ncall on them, or indeed on anybody. He generally had to be caught, if\nyou wanted him badly, as he slipped quietly along a hedgerow of an early\nmorning or a late evening, or else hunted up in his own house in the\nmiddle of the Wood, which was a serious undertaking.\n\nThe Badger strode heavily into the room, and stood looking at the\ntwo animals with an expression full of seriousness. The Rat let his\negg-spoon fall on the table-cloth, and sat open-mouthed.\n\n‘The hour has come!’ said the Badger at last with great solemnity.\n\n‘What hour?’ asked the Rat uneasily, glancing at the clock on the\nmantelpiece.\n\n‘WHOSE hour, you should rather say,’ replied the Badger. ‘Why, Toad’s\nhour! The hour of Toad! I said I would take him in hand as soon as the\nwinter was well over, and I’m going to take him in hand to-day!’\n\n‘Toad’s hour, of course!’ cried the Mole delightedly. ‘Hooray! I\nremember now! WE’LL teach him to be a sensible Toad!’\n\n‘This very morning,’ continued the Badger, taking an arm-chair, ‘as\nI learnt last night from a trustworthy source, another new and\nexceptionally powerful motor-car will arrive at Toad Hall on approval or\nreturn. At this very moment, perhaps, Toad is busy arraying himself in\nthose singularly hideous habiliments so dear to him, which transform him\nfrom a (comparatively) good-looking Toad into an Object which throws any\ndecent-minded animal that comes across it into a violent fit. We must\nbe up and doing, ere it is too late. You two animals will accompany me\ninstantly to Toad Hall, and the work of rescue shall be accomplished.’\n\n‘Right you are!’ cried the Rat, starting up. ‘We’ll rescue the poor\nunhappy animal! We’ll convert him! He’ll be the most converted Toad that\never was before we’ve done with him!’\n\nThey set off up the road on their mission of mercy, Badger leading the\nway. Animals when in company walk in a proper and sensible manner, in\nsingle file, instead of sprawling all across the road and being of no\nuse or support to each other in case of sudden trouble or danger.\n\nThey reached the carriage-drive of Toad Hall to find, as the Badger had\nanticipated, a shiny new motor-car, of great size, painted a bright\nred (Toad’s favourite colour), standing in front of the house. As they\nneared the door it was flung open, and Mr. Toad, arrayed in goggles,\ncap, gaiters, and enormous overcoat, came swaggering down the steps,\ndrawing on his gauntleted gloves.\n\n‘Hullo! come on, you fellows!’ he cried cheerfully on catching sight of\nthem. ‘You’re just in time to come with me for a jolly--to come for a\njolly--for a--er--jolly----’\n\nHis hearty accents faltered and fell away as he noticed the stern\nunbending look on the countenances of his silent friends, and his\ninvitation remained unfinished.\n\nThe Badger strode up the steps. ‘Take him inside,’ he said sternly to\nhis companions. Then, as Toad was hustled through the door, struggling\nand protesting, he turned to the chauffeur in charge of the new\nmotor-car.\n\n‘I’m afraid you won’t be wanted to-day,’ he said. ‘Mr. Toad has changed\nhis mind. He will not require the car. Please understand that this is\nfinal. You needn’t wait.’ Then he followed the others inside and shut\nthe door.\n\n‘Now then!’ he said to the Toad, when the four of them stood together in\nthe Hall, ‘first of all, take those ridiculous things off!’\n\n‘Shan’t!’ replied Toad, with great spirit. ‘What is the meaning of this\ngross outrage? I demand an instant explanation.’\n\n‘Take them off him, then, you two,’ ordered the Badger briefly.\n\nThey had to lay Toad out on the floor, kicking and calling all sorts of\nnames, before they could get to work properly. Then the Rat sat on him,\nand the Mole got his motor-clothes off him bit by bit, and they stood\nhim up on his legs again. A good deal of his blustering spirit seemed\nto have evaporated with the removal of his fine panoply. Now that he was\nmerely Toad, and no longer the Terror of the Highway, he giggled\nfeebly and looked from one to the other appealingly, seeming quite to\nunderstand the situation.\n\n‘You knew it must come to this, sooner or later, Toad,’ the Badger\nexplained severely.\n\nYou’ve disregarded all the warnings we’ve given you, you’ve gone on\nsquandering the money your father left you, and you’re getting us\nanimals a bad name in the district by your furious driving and your\nsmashes and your rows with the police. Independence is all very well,\nbut we animals never allow our friends to make fools of themselves\nbeyond a certain limit; and that limit you’ve reached. Now, you’re a\ngood fellow in many respects, and I don’t want to be too hard on you.\nI’ll make one more effort to bring you to reason. You will come with\nme into the smoking-room, and there you will hear some facts about\nyourself; and we’ll see whether you come out of that room the same Toad\nthat you went in.’\n\nHe took Toad firmly by the arm, led him into the smoking-room, and\nclosed the door behind them.\n\n‘THAT’S no good!’ said the Rat contemptuously. ‘TALKING to Toad’ll never\ncure him. He’ll SAY anything.’\n\nThey made themselves comfortable in armchairs and waited patiently.\nThrough the closed door they could just hear the long continuous drone\nof the Badger’s voice, rising and falling in waves of oratory; and\npresently they noticed that the sermon began to be punctuated at\nintervals by long-drawn sobs, evidently proceeding from the bosom\nof Toad, who was a soft-hearted and affectionate fellow, very easily\nconverted--for the time being--to any point of view.\n\nAfter some three-quarters of an hour the door opened, and the Badger\nreappeared, solemnly leading by the paw a very limp and dejected Toad.\nHis skin hung baggily about him, his legs wobbled, and his cheeks were\nfurrowed by the tears so plentifully called forth by the Badger’s moving\ndiscourse.\n\n‘Sit down there, Toad,’ said the Badger kindly, pointing to a chair. ‘My\nfriends,’ he went on, ‘I am pleased to inform you that Toad has at last\nseen the error of his ways. He is truly sorry for his misguided conduct\nin the past, and he has undertaken to give up motor-cars entirely and\nfor ever. I have his solemn promise to that effect.’\n\n‘That is very good news,’ said the Mole gravely.\n\n‘Very good news indeed,’ observed the Rat dubiously, ‘if only--IF\nonly----’\n\nHe was looking very hard at Toad as he said this, and could not help\nthinking he perceived something vaguely resembling a twinkle in that\nanimal’s still sorrowful eye.\n\n‘There’s only one thing more to be done,’ continued the gratified\nBadger. ‘Toad, I want you solemnly to repeat, before your friends here,\nwhat you fully admitted to me in the smoking-room just now. First, you\nare sorry for what you’ve done, and you see the folly of it all?’\n\nThere was a long, long pause. Toad looked desperately this way and that,\nwhile the other animals waited in grave silence. At last he spoke.\n\n‘No!’ he said, a little sullenly, but stoutly; ‘I’m NOT sorry. And it\nwasn’t folly at all! It was simply glorious!’\n\n‘What?’ cried the Badger, greatly scandalised. ‘You backsliding animal,\ndidn’t you tell me just now, in there----’\n\n‘Oh, yes, yes, in THERE,’ said Toad impatiently. ‘I’d have said anything\nin THERE. You’re so eloquent, dear Badger, and so moving, and so\nconvincing, and put all your points so frightfully well--you can do what\nyou like with me in THERE, and you know it. But I’ve been searching my\nmind since, and going over things in it, and I find that I’m not a bit\nsorry or repentant really, so it’s no earthly good saying I am; now, is\nit?’\n\n‘Then you don’t promise,’ said the Badger, ‘never to touch a motor-car\nagain?’\n\n‘Certainly not!’ replied Toad emphatically. ‘On the contrary, I\nfaithfully promise that the very first motor-car I see, poop-poop! off I\ngo in it!’\n\n‘Told you so, didn’t I?’ observed the Rat to the Mole.\n\n‘Very well, then,’ said the Badger firmly, rising to his feet. ‘Since\nyou won’t yield to persuasion, we’ll try what force can do. I feared it\nwould come to this all along. You’ve often asked us three to come and\nstay with you, Toad, in this handsome house of yours; well, now we’re\ngoing to. When we’ve converted you to a proper point of view we may\nquit, but not before. Take him upstairs, you two, and lock him up in his\nbedroom, while we arrange matters between ourselves.’\n\n‘It’s for your own good, Toady, you know,’ said the Rat kindly, as Toad,\nkicking and struggling, was hauled up the stairs by his two faithful\nfriends. ‘Think what fun we shall all have together, just as we used to,\nwhen you’ve quite got over this--this painful attack of yours!’\n\n‘We’ll take great care of everything for you till you’re well, Toad,’\nsaid the Mole; ‘and we’ll see your money isn’t wasted, as it has been.’\n\n‘No more of those regrettable incidents with the police, Toad,’ said the\nRat, as they thrust him into his bedroom.\n\n‘And no more weeks in hospital, being ordered about by female nurses,\nToad,’ added the Mole, turning the key on him.\n\nThey descended the stair, Toad shouting abuse at them through the\nkeyhole; and the three friends then met in conference on the situation.\n\n‘It’s going to be a tedious business,’ said the Badger, sighing. ‘I’ve\nnever seen Toad so determined. However, we will see it out. He must\nnever be left an instant unguarded. We shall have to take it in turns to\nbe with him, till the poison has worked itself out of his system.’\n\nThey arranged watches accordingly. Each animal took it in turns to sleep\nin Toad’s room at night, and they divided the day up between them. At\nfirst Toad was undoubtedly very trying to his careful guardians. When\nhis violent paroxysms possessed him he would arrange bedroom chairs\nin rude resemblance of a motor-car and would crouch on the foremost of\nthem, bent forward and staring fixedly ahead, making uncouth and\nghastly noises, till the climax was reached, when, turning a complete\nsomersault, he would lie prostrate amidst the ruins of the chairs,\napparently completely satisfied for the moment. As time passed, however,\nthese painful seizures grew gradually less frequent, and his friends\nstrove to divert his mind into fresh channels. But his interest in\nother matters did not seem to revive, and he grew apparently languid and\ndepressed.\n\nOne fine morning the Rat, whose turn it was to go on duty, went upstairs\nto relieve Badger, whom he found fidgeting to be off and stretch his\nlegs in a long ramble round his wood and down his earths and burrows.\n‘Toad’s still in bed,’ he told the Rat, outside the door. ‘Can’t get\nmuch out of him, except, “O leave him alone, he wants nothing, perhaps\nhe’ll be better presently, it may pass off in time, don’t be unduly\nanxious,” and so on. Now, you look out, Rat! When Toad’s quiet and\nsubmissive and playing at being the hero of a Sunday-school prize, then\nhe’s at his artfullest. There’s sure to be something up. I know him.\nWell, now, I must be off.’\n\n‘How are you to-day, old chap?’ inquired the Rat cheerfully, as he\napproached Toad’s bedside.\n\nHe had to wait some minutes for an answer. At last a feeble voice\nreplied, ‘Thank you so much, dear Ratty! So good of you to inquire! But\nfirst tell me how you are yourself, and the excellent Mole?’\n\n‘O, WE’RE all right,’ replied the Rat. ‘Mole,’ he added incautiously,\n‘is going out for a run round with Badger. They’ll be out till luncheon\ntime, so you and I will spend a pleasant morning together, and I’ll do\nmy best to amuse you. Now jump up, there’s a good fellow, and don’t lie\nmoping there on a fine morning like this!’\n\n‘Dear, kind Rat,’ murmured Toad, ‘how little you realise my condition,\nand how very far I am from “jumping up” now--if ever! But do not trouble\nabout me. I hate being a burden to my friends, and I do not expect to be\none much longer. Indeed, I almost hope not.’\n\n‘Well, I hope not, too,’ said the Rat heartily. ‘You’ve been a fine\nbother to us all this time, and I’m glad to hear it’s going to stop. And\nin weather like this, and the boating season just beginning! It’s too\nbad of you, Toad! It isn’t the trouble we mind, but you’re making us\nmiss such an awful lot.’\n\n‘I’m afraid it IS the trouble you mind, though,’ replied the Toad\nlanguidly. ‘I can quite understand it. It’s natural enough. You’re tired\nof bothering about me. I mustn’t ask you to do anything further. I’m a\nnuisance, I know.’\n\n‘You are, indeed,’ said the Rat. ‘But I tell you, I’d take any trouble\non earth for you, if only you’d be a sensible animal.’\n\n‘If I thought that, Ratty,’ murmured Toad, more feebly than ever, ‘then\nI would beg you--for the last time, probably--to step round to the\nvillage as quickly as possible--even now it may be too late--and fetch\nthe doctor. But don’t you bother. It’s only a trouble, and perhaps we\nmay as well let things take their course.’\n\n‘Why, what do you want a doctor for?’ inquired the Rat, coming closer\nand examining him. He certainly lay very still and flat, and his voice\nwas weaker and his manner much changed.\n\n‘Surely you have noticed of late----’ murmured Toad. ‘But, no--why\nshould you? Noticing things is only a trouble. To-morrow, indeed, you\nmay be saying to yourself, “O, if only I had noticed sooner! If only I\nhad done something!” But no; it’s a trouble. Never mind--forget that I\nasked.’\n\n‘Look here, old man,’ said the Rat, beginning to get rather alarmed, ‘of\ncourse I’ll fetch a doctor to you, if you really think you want him. But\nyou can hardly be bad enough for that yet. Let’s talk about something\nelse.’\n\n‘I fear, dear friend,’ said Toad, with a sad smile, ‘that “talk” can do\nlittle in a case like this--or doctors either, for that matter; still,\none must grasp at the slightest straw. And, by the way--while you\nare about it--I HATE to give you additional trouble, but I happen to\nremember that you will pass the door--would you mind at the same time\nasking the lawyer to step up? It would be a convenience to me, and there\nare moments--perhaps I should say there is A moment--when one must face\ndisagreeable tasks, at whatever cost to exhausted nature!’\n\n‘A lawyer! O, he must be really bad!’ the affrighted Rat said to\nhimself, as he hurried from the room, not forgetting, however, to lock\nthe door carefully behind him.\n\nOutside, he stopped to consider. The other two were far away, and he had\nno one to consult.\n\n‘It’s best to be on the safe side,’ he said, on reflection. ‘I’ve known\nToad fancy himself frightfully bad before, without the slightest reason;\nbut I’ve never heard him ask for a lawyer! If there’s nothing really the\nmatter, the doctor will tell him he’s an old ass, and cheer him up; and\nthat will be something gained. I’d better humour him and go; it won’t\ntake very long.’ So he ran off to the village on his errand of mercy.\n\nThe Toad, who had hopped lightly out of bed as soon as he heard the\nkey turned in the lock, watched him eagerly from the window till he\ndisappeared down the carriage-drive. Then, laughing heartily, he dressed\nas quickly as possible in the smartest suit he could lay hands on at the\nmoment, filled his pockets with cash which he took from a small drawer\nin the dressing-table, and next, knotting the sheets from his bed\ntogether and tying one end of the improvised rope round the central\nmullion of the handsome Tudor window which formed such a feature of his\nbedroom, he scrambled out, slid lightly to the ground, and, taking the\nopposite direction to the Rat, marched off lightheartedly, whistling a\nmerry tune.\n\nIt was a gloomy luncheon for Rat when the Badger and the Mole at\nlength returned, and he had to face them at table with his pitiful and\nunconvincing story. The Badger’s caustic, not to say brutal, remarks may\nbe imagined, and therefore passed over; but it was painful to the Rat\nthat even the Mole, though he took his friend’s side as far as possible,\ncould not help saying, ‘You’ve been a bit of a duffer this time, Ratty!\nToad, too, of all animals!’\n\n‘He did it awfully well,’ said the crestfallen Rat.\n\n‘He did YOU awfully well!’ rejoined the Badger hotly. ‘However, talking\nwon’t mend matters. He’s got clear away for the time, that’s certain;\nand the worst of it is, he’ll be so conceited with what he’ll think is\nhis cleverness that he may commit any folly. One comfort is, we’re free\nnow, and needn’t waste any more of our precious time doing sentry-go.\nBut we’d better continue to sleep at Toad Hall for a while longer.\nToad may be brought back at any moment--on a stretcher, or between two\npolicemen.’\n\nSo spoke the Badger, not knowing what the future held in store, or how\nmuch water, and of how turbid a character, was to run under bridges\nbefore Toad should sit at ease again in his ancestral Hall.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Toad, gay and irresponsible, was walking briskly along the\nhigh road, some miles from home. At first he had taken by-paths, and\ncrossed many fields, and changed his course several times, in case of\npursuit; but now, feeling by this time safe from recapture, and the sun\nsmiling brightly on him, and all Nature joining in a chorus of approval\nto the song of self-praise that his own heart was singing to him, he\nalmost danced along the road in his satisfaction and conceit.\n\n‘Smart piece of work that!’ he remarked to himself chuckling. ‘Brain\nagainst brute force--and brain came out on the top--as it’s bound to\ndo. Poor old Ratty! My! won’t he catch it when the Badger gets back!\nA worthy fellow, Ratty, with many good qualities, but very little\nintelligence and absolutely no education. I must take him in hand some\nday, and see if I can make something of him.’\n\nFilled full of conceited thoughts such as these he strode along, his\nhead in the air, till he reached a little town, where the sign of\n‘The Red Lion,’ swinging across the road halfway down the main street,\nreminded him that he had not breakfasted that day, and that he was\nexceedingly hungry after his long walk. He marched into the Inn, ordered\nthe best luncheon that could be provided at so short a notice, and sat\ndown to eat it in the coffee-room.\n\nHe was about half-way through his meal when an only too familiar sound,\napproaching down the street, made him start and fall a-trembling all\nover. The poop-poop! drew nearer and nearer, the car could be heard to\nturn into the inn-yard and come to a stop, and Toad had to hold on to\nthe leg of the table to conceal his over-mastering emotion. Presently\nthe party entered the coffee-room, hungry, talkative, and gay, voluble\non their experiences of the morning and the merits of the chariot that\nhad brought them along so well. Toad listened eagerly, all ears, for a\ntime; at last he could stand it no longer. He slipped out of the\nroom quietly, paid his bill at the bar, and as soon as he got outside\nsauntered round quietly to the inn-yard. ‘There cannot be any harm,’ he\nsaid to himself, ‘in my only just LOOKING at it!’\n\nThe car stood in the middle of the yard, quite unattended, the\nstable-helps and other hangers-on being all at their dinner. Toad walked\nslowly round it, inspecting, criticising, musing deeply.\n\n‘I wonder,’ he said to himself presently, ‘I wonder if this sort of car\nSTARTS easily?’\n\nNext moment, hardly knowing how it came about, he found he had hold of\nthe handle and was turning it. As the familiar sound broke forth, the\nold passion seized on Toad and completely mastered him, body and soul.\nAs if in a dream he found himself, somehow, seated in the driver’s seat;\nas if in a dream, he pulled the lever and swung the car round the yard\nand out through the archway; and, as if in a dream, all sense of\nright and wrong, all fear of obvious consequences, seemed temporarily\nsuspended. He increased his pace, and as the car devoured the street\nand leapt forth on the high road through the open country, he was only\nconscious that he was Toad once more, Toad at his best and highest, Toad\nthe terror, the traffic-queller, the Lord of the lone trail, before whom\nall must give way or be smitten into nothingness and everlasting night.\nHe chanted as he flew, and the car responded with sonorous drone; the\nmiles were eaten up under him as he sped he knew not whither, fulfilling\nhis instincts, living his hour, reckless of what might come to him.\n\n\n* * * * * *\n\n‘To my mind,’ observed the Chairman of the Bench of Magistrates\ncheerfully, ‘the ONLY difficulty that presents itself in this otherwise\nvery clear case is, how we can possibly make it sufficiently hot for the\nincorrigible rogue and hardened ruffian whom we see cowering in the\ndock before us. Let me see: he has been found guilty, on the clearest\nevidence, first, of stealing a valuable motor-car; secondly, of driving\nto the public danger; and, thirdly, of gross impertinence to the rural\npolice. Mr. Clerk, will you tell us, please, what is the very stiffest\npenalty we can impose for each of these offences? Without, of course,\ngiving the prisoner the benefit of any doubt, because there isn’t any.’\n\nThe Clerk scratched his nose with his pen. ‘Some people would consider,’\nhe observed, ‘that stealing the motor-car was the worst offence; and so\nit is. But cheeking the police undoubtedly carries the severest penalty;\nand so it ought. Supposing you were to say twelve months for the\ntheft, which is mild; and three years for the furious driving, which is\nlenient; and fifteen years for the cheek, which was pretty bad sort of\ncheek, judging by what we’ve heard from the witness-box, even if you\nonly believe one-tenth part of what you heard, and I never believe more\nmyself--those figures, if added together correctly, tot up to nineteen\nyears----’\n\n‘First-rate!’ said the Chairman.\n\n‘--So you had better make it a round twenty years and be on the safe\nside,’ concluded the Clerk.\n\n‘An excellent suggestion!’ said the Chairman approvingly. ‘Prisoner!\nPull yourself together and try and stand up straight. It’s going to be\ntwenty years for you this time. And mind, if you appear before us\nagain, upon any charge whatever, we shall have to deal with you very\nseriously!’\n\nThen the brutal minions of the law fell upon the hapless Toad; loaded\nhim with chains, and dragged him from the Court House, shrieking,\npraying, protesting; across the marketplace, where the playful populace,\nalways as severe upon detected crime as they are sympathetic and helpful\nwhen one is merely ‘wanted,’ assailed him with jeers, carrots, and\npopular catch-words; past hooting school children, their innocent faces\nlit up with the pleasure they ever derive from the sight of a gentleman\nin difficulties; across the hollow-sounding drawbridge, below the spiky\nportcullis, under the frowning archway of the grim old castle, whose\nancient towers soared high overhead; past guardrooms full of grinning\nsoldiery off duty, past sentries who coughed in a horrid, sarcastic\nway, because that is as much as a sentry on his post dare do to show\nhis contempt and abhorrence of crime; up time-worn winding stairs, past\nmen-at-arms in casquet and corselet of steel, darting threatening looks\nthrough their vizards; across courtyards, where mastiffs strained at\ntheir leash and pawed the air to get at him; past ancient warders, their\nhalberds leant against the wall, dozing over a pasty and a flagon of\nbrown ale; on and on, past the rack-chamber and the thumbscrew-room,\npast the turning that led to the private scaffold, till they reached\nthe door of the grimmest dungeon that lay in the heart of the innermost\nkeep. There at last they paused, where an ancient gaoler sat fingering a\nbunch of mighty keys.\n\n‘Oddsbodikins!’ said the sergeant of police, taking off his helmet and\nwiping his forehead. ‘Rouse thee, old loon, and take over from us this\nvile Toad, a criminal of deepest guilt and matchless artfulness and\nresource. Watch and ward him with all thy skill; and mark thee well,\ngreybeard, should aught untoward befall, thy old head shall answer for\nhis--and a murrain on both of them!’\n\nThe gaoler nodded grimly, laying his withered hand on the shoulder of\nthe miserable Toad. The rusty key creaked in the lock, the great door\nclanged behind them; and Toad was a helpless prisoner in the remotest\ndungeon of the best-guarded keep of the stoutest castle in all the\nlength and breadth of Merry England.\n\n\n\n\nVII. THE PIPER AT THE GATES OF DAWN\n\nThe Willow-Wren was twittering his thin little song, hidden himself in\nthe dark selvedge of the river bank. Though it was past ten o’clock\nat night, the sky still clung to and retained some lingering skirts\nof light from the departed day; and the sullen heats of the torrid\nafternoon broke up and rolled away at the dispersing touch of the cool\nfingers of the short midsummer night. Mole lay stretched on the bank,\nstill panting from the stress of the fierce day that had been cloudless\nfrom dawn to late sunset, and waited for his friend to return. He had\nbeen on the river with some companions, leaving the Water Rat free to\nkeep a engagement of long standing with Otter; and he had come back to\nfind the house dark and deserted, and no sign of Rat, who was doubtless\nkeeping it up late with his old comrade. It was still too hot to think\nof staying indoors, so he lay on some cool dock-leaves, and thought over\nthe past day and its doings, and how very good they all had been.\n\nThe Rat’s light footfall was presently heard approaching over the\nparched grass. ‘O, the blessed coolness!’ he said, and sat down, gazing\nthoughtfully into the river, silent and pre-occupied.\n\n‘You stayed to supper, of course?’ said the Mole presently.\n\n‘Simply had to,’ said the Rat. ‘They wouldn’t hear of my going before.\nYou know how kind they always are. And they made things as jolly for me\nas ever they could, right up to the moment I left. But I felt a brute\nall the time, as it was clear to me they were very unhappy, though they\ntried to hide it. Mole, I’m afraid they’re in trouble. Little Portly is\nmissing again; and you know what a lot his father thinks of him, though\nhe never says much about it.’\n\n‘What, that child?’ said the Mole lightly. ‘Well, suppose he is; why\nworry about it? He’s always straying off and getting lost, and turning\nup again; he’s so adventurous. But no harm ever happens to him.\nEverybody hereabouts knows him and likes him, just as they do old Otter,\nand you may be sure some animal or other will come across him and bring\nhim back again all right. Why, we’ve found him ourselves, miles from\nhome, and quite self-possessed and cheerful!’\n\n‘Yes; but this time it’s more serious,’ said the Rat gravely. ‘He’s been\nmissing for some days now, and the Otters have hunted everywhere, high\nand low, without finding the slightest trace. And they’ve asked every\nanimal, too, for miles around, and no one knows anything about him.\nOtter’s evidently more anxious than he’ll admit. I got out of him that\nyoung Portly hasn’t learnt to swim very well yet, and I can see\nhe’s thinking of the weir. There’s a lot of water coming down still,\nconsidering the time of the year, and the place always had a fascination\nfor the child. And then there are--well, traps and things--YOU know.\nOtter’s not the fellow to be nervous about any son of his before it’s\ntime. And now he IS nervous. When I left, he came out with me--said he\nwanted some air, and talked about stretching his legs. But I could see\nit wasn’t that, so I drew him out and pumped him, and got it all from\nhim at last. He was going to spend the night watching by the ford. You\nknow the place where the old ford used to be, in by-gone days before\nthey built the bridge?’\n\n‘I know it well,’ said the Mole. ‘But why should Otter choose to watch\nthere?’\n\n‘Well, it seems that it was there he gave Portly his first\nswimming-lesson,’ continued the Rat. ‘From that shallow, gravelly spit\nnear the bank. And it was there he used to teach him fishing, and there\nyoung Portly caught his first fish, of which he was so very proud. The\nchild loved the spot, and Otter thinks that if he came wandering\nback from wherever he is--if he IS anywhere by this time, poor little\nchap--he might make for the ford he was so fond of; or if he came across\nit he’d remember it well, and stop there and play, perhaps. So Otter\ngoes there every night and watches--on the chance, you know, just on the\nchance!’\n\nThey were silent for a time, both thinking of the same thing--the\nlonely, heart-sore animal, crouched by the ford, watching and waiting,\nthe long night through--on the chance.\n\n‘Well, well,’ said the Rat presently, ‘I suppose we ought to be thinking\nabout turning in.’ But he never offered to move.\n\n‘Rat,’ said the Mole, ‘I simply can’t go and turn in, and go to sleep,\nand DO nothing, even though there doesn’t seem to be anything to be\ndone. We’ll get the boat out, and paddle up stream. The moon will be up\nin an hour or so, and then we will search as well as we can--anyhow, it\nwill be better than going to bed and doing NOTHING.’\n\n‘Just what I was thinking myself,’ said the Rat. ‘It’s not the sort of\nnight for bed anyhow; and daybreak is not so very far off, and then we\nmay pick up some news of him from early risers as we go along.’\n\nThey got the boat out, and the Rat took the sculls, paddling with\ncaution. Out in midstream, there was a clear, narrow track that faintly\nreflected the sky; but wherever shadows fell on the water from bank,\nbush, or tree, they were as solid to all appearance as the banks\nthemselves, and the Mole had to steer with judgment accordingly. Dark\nand deserted as it was, the night was full of small noises, song and\nchatter and rustling, telling of the busy little population who were\nup and about, plying their trades and vocations through the night\ntill sunshine should fall on them at last and send them off to their\nwell-earned repose. The water’s own noises, too, were more apparent than\nby day, its gurglings and ‘cloops’ more unexpected and near at hand;\nand constantly they started at what seemed a sudden clear call from an\nactual articulate voice.\n\nThe line of the horizon was clear and hard against the sky, and in\none particular quarter it showed black against a silvery climbing\nphosphorescence that grew and grew. At last, over the rim of the waiting\nearth the moon lifted with slow majesty till it swung clear of the\nhorizon and rode off, free of moorings; and once more they began to see\nsurfaces--meadows wide-spread, and quiet gardens, and the river itself\nfrom bank to bank, all softly disclosed, all washed clean of mystery\nand terror, all radiant again as by day, but with a difference that was\ntremendous. Their old haunts greeted them again in other raiment, as if\nthey had slipped away and put on this pure new apparel and come quietly\nback, smiling as they shyly waited to see if they would be recognised\nagain under it.\n\nFastening their boat to a willow, the friends landed in this silent,\nsilver kingdom, and patiently explored the hedges, the hollow trees,\nthe runnels and their little culverts, the ditches and dry water-ways.\nEmbarking again and crossing over, they worked their way up the stream\nin this manner, while the moon, serene and detached in a cloudless sky,\ndid what she could, though so far off, to help them in their quest; till\nher hour came and she sank earthwards reluctantly, and left them, and\nmystery once more held field and river.\n\nThen a change began slowly to declare itself. The horizon became\nclearer, field and tree came more into sight, and somehow with a\ndifferent look; the mystery began to drop away from them. A bird piped\nsuddenly, and was still; and a light breeze sprang up and set the reeds\nand bulrushes rustling. Rat, who was in the stern of the boat, while\nMole sculled, sat up suddenly and listened with a passionate intentness.\nMole, who with gentle strokes was just keeping the boat moving while he\nscanned the banks with care, looked at him with curiosity.\n\n‘It’s gone!’ sighed the Rat, sinking back in his seat again. ‘So\nbeautiful and strange and new. Since it was to end so soon, I almost\nwish I had never heard it. For it has roused a longing in me that is\npain, and nothing seems worth while but just to hear that sound once\nmore and go on listening to it for ever. No! There it is again!’ he\ncried, alert once more. Entranced, he was silent for a long space,\nspellbound.\n\n‘Now it passes on and I begin to lose it,’ he said presently. ‘O Mole!\nthe beauty of it! The merry bubble and joy, the thin, clear, happy call\nof the distant piping! Such music I never dreamed of, and the call in\nit is stronger even than the music is sweet! Row on, Mole, row! For the\nmusic and the call must be for us.’\n\nThe Mole, greatly wondering, obeyed. ‘I hear nothing myself,’ he said,\n‘but the wind playing in the reeds and rushes and osiers.’\n\nThe Rat never answered, if indeed he heard. Rapt, transported,\ntrembling, he was possessed in all his senses by this new divine thing\nthat caught up his helpless soul and swung and dandled it, a powerless\nbut happy infant in a strong sustaining grasp.\n\nIn silence Mole rowed steadily, and soon they came to a point where the\nriver divided, a long backwater branching off to one side. With a\nslight movement of his head Rat, who had long dropped the rudder-lines,\ndirected the rower to take the backwater. The creeping tide of light\ngained and gained, and now they could see the colour of the flowers that\ngemmed the water’s edge.\n\n‘Clearer and nearer still,’ cried the Rat joyously. ‘Now you must surely\nhear it! Ah--at last--I see you do!’\n\nBreathless and transfixed the Mole stopped rowing as the liquid run of\nthat glad piping broke on him like a wave, caught him up, and possessed\nhim utterly. He saw the tears on his comrade’s cheeks, and bowed his\nhead and understood. For a space they hung there, brushed by the purple\nloose-strife that fringed the bank; then the clear imperious summons\nthat marched hand-in-hand with the intoxicating melody imposed its will\non Mole, and mechanically he bent to his oars again. And the light grew\nsteadily stronger, but no birds sang as they were wont to do at the\napproach of dawn; and but for the heavenly music all was marvellously\nstill.\n\nOn either side of them, as they glided onwards, the rich meadow-grass\nseemed that morning of a freshness and a greenness unsurpassable. Never\nhad they noticed the roses so vivid, the willow-herb so riotous,\nthe meadow-sweet so odorous and pervading. Then the murmur of the\napproaching weir began to hold the air, and they felt a consciousness\nthat they were nearing the end, whatever it might be, that surely\nawaited their expedition.\n\nA wide half-circle of foam and glinting lights and shining shoulders\nof green water, the great weir closed the backwater from bank to\nbank, troubled all the quiet surface with twirling eddies and floating\nfoam-streaks, and deadened all other sounds with its solemn and soothing\nrumble. In midmost of the stream, embraced in the weir’s shimmering\narm-spread, a small island lay anchored, fringed close with willow and\nsilver birch and alder. Reserved, shy, but full of significance, it hid\nwhatever it might hold behind a veil, keeping it till the hour should\ncome, and, with the hour, those who were called and chosen.\n\nSlowly, but with no doubt or hesitation whatever, and in something of a\nsolemn expectancy, the two animals passed through the broken tumultuous\nwater and moored their boat at the flowery margin of the island. In\nsilence they landed, and pushed through the blossom and scented herbage\nand undergrowth that led up to the level ground, till they stood on\na little lawn of a marvellous green, set round with Nature’s own\norchard-trees--crab-apple, wild cherry, and sloe.\n\n‘This is the place of my song-dream, the place the music played to me,’\nwhispered the Rat, as if in a trance. ‘Here, in this holy place, here if\nanywhere, surely we shall find Him!’\n\nThen suddenly the Mole felt a great Awe fall upon him, an awe that\nturned his muscles to water, bowed his head, and rooted his feet to the\nground. It was no panic terror--indeed he felt wonderfully at peace and\nhappy--but it was an awe that smote and held him and, without seeing, he\nknew it could only mean that some august Presence was very, very near.\nWith difficulty he turned to look for his friend and saw him at his\nside cowed, stricken, and trembling violently. And still there was utter\nsilence in the populous bird-haunted branches around them; and still the\nlight grew and grew.\n\nPerhaps he would never have dared to raise his eyes, but that, though\nthe piping was now hushed, the call and the summons seemed still\ndominant and imperious. He might not refuse, were Death himself waiting\nto strike him instantly, once he had looked with mortal eye on things\nrightly kept hidden. Trembling he obeyed, and raised his humble head;\nand then, in that utter clearness of the imminent dawn, while Nature,\nflushed with fullness of incredible colour, seemed to hold her breath\nfor the event, he looked in the very eyes of the Friend and Helper;\nsaw the backward sweep of the curved horns, gleaming in the growing\ndaylight; saw the stern, hooked nose between the kindly eyes that were\nlooking down on them humourously, while the bearded mouth broke into a\nhalf-smile at the corners; saw the rippling muscles on the arm that lay\nacross the broad chest, the long supple hand still holding the pan-pipes\nonly just fallen away from the parted lips; saw the splendid curves of\nthe shaggy limbs disposed in majestic ease on the sward; saw, last of\nall, nestling between his very hooves, sleeping soundly in entire peace\nand contentment, the little, round, podgy, childish form of the baby\notter. All this he saw, for one moment breathless and intense, vivid\non the morning sky; and still, as he looked, he lived; and still, as he\nlived, he wondered.\n\n‘Rat!’ he found breath to whisper, shaking. ‘Are you afraid?’\n\n‘Afraid?’ murmured the Rat, his eyes shining with unutterable love.\n‘Afraid! Of HIM? O, never, never! And yet--and yet--O, Mole, I am\nafraid!’\n\nThen the two animals, crouching to the earth, bowed their heads and did\nworship.\n\nSudden and magnificent, the sun’s broad golden disc showed itself over\nthe horizon facing them; and the first rays, shooting across the level\nwater-meadows, took the animals full in the eyes and dazzled them. When\nthey were able to look once more, the Vision had vanished, and the air\nwas full of the carol of birds that hailed the dawn.\n\nAs they stared blankly in dumb misery deepening as they slowly realised\nall they had seen and all they had lost, a capricious little breeze,\ndancing up from the surface of the water, tossed the aspens, shook the\ndewy roses and blew lightly and caressingly in their faces; and with its\nsoft touch came instant oblivion. For this is the last best gift\nthat the kindly demi-god is careful to bestow on those to whom he has\nrevealed himself in their helping: the gift of forgetfulness. Lest\nthe awful remembrance should remain and grow, and overshadow mirth and\npleasure, and the great haunting memory should spoil all the after-lives\nof little animals helped out of difficulties, in order that they should\nbe happy and lighthearted as before.\n\nMole rubbed his eyes and stared at Rat, who was looking about him in\na puzzled sort of way. ‘I beg your pardon; what did you say, Rat?’ he\nasked.\n\n‘I think I was only remarking,’ said Rat slowly, ‘that this was the\nright sort of place, and that here, if anywhere, we should find him. And\nlook! Why, there he is, the little fellow!’ And with a cry of delight he\nran towards the slumbering Portly.\n\nBut Mole stood still a moment, held in thought. As one wakened suddenly\nfrom a beautiful dream, who struggles to recall it, and can re-capture\nnothing but a dim sense of the beauty of it, the beauty! Till that, too,\nfades away in its turn, and the dreamer bitterly accepts the hard, cold\nwaking and all its penalties; so Mole, after struggling with his memory\nfor a brief space, shook his head sadly and followed the Rat.\n\nPortly woke up with a joyous squeak, and wriggled with pleasure at the\nsight of his father’s friends, who had played with him so often in past\ndays. In a moment, however, his face grew blank, and he fell to hunting\nround in a circle with pleading whine. As a child that has fallen\nhappily asleep in its nurse’s arms, and wakes to find itself alone and\nlaid in a strange place, and searches corners and cupboards, and runs\nfrom room to room, despair growing silently in its heart, even so Portly\nsearched the island and searched, dogged and unwearying, till at last\nthe black moment came for giving it up, and sitting down and crying\nbitterly.\n\nThe Mole ran quickly to comfort the little animal; but Rat, lingering,\nlooked long and doubtfully at certain hoof-marks deep in the sward.\n\n‘Some--great--animal--has been here,’ he murmured slowly and\nthoughtfully; and stood musing, musing; his mind strangely stirred.\n\n‘Come along, Rat!’ called the Mole. ‘Think of poor Otter, waiting up\nthere by the ford!’\n\nPortly had soon been comforted by the promise of a treat--a jaunt on the\nriver in Mr. Rat’s real boat; and the two animals conducted him to the\nwater’s side, placed him securely between them in the bottom of the\nboat, and paddled off down the backwater. The sun was fully up by now,\nand hot on them, birds sang lustily and without restraint, and flowers\nsmiled and nodded from either bank, but somehow--so thought the\nanimals--with less of richness and blaze of colour than they seemed to\nremember seeing quite recently somewhere--they wondered where.\n\nThe main river reached again, they turned the boat’s head upstream,\ntowards the point where they knew their friend was keeping his lonely\nvigil. As they drew near the familiar ford, the Mole took the boat in\nto the bank, and they lifted Portly out and set him on his legs on the\ntow-path, gave him his marching orders and a friendly farewell pat on\nthe back, and shoved out into mid-stream. They watched the little animal\nas he waddled along the path contentedly and with importance; watched\nhim till they saw his muzzle suddenly lift and his waddle break into a\nclumsy amble as he quickened his pace with shrill whines and wriggles of\nrecognition. Looking up the river, they could see Otter start up, tense\nand rigid, from out of the shallows where he crouched in dumb patience,\nand could hear his amazed and joyous bark as he bounded up through the\nosiers on to the path. Then the Mole, with a strong pull on one oar,\nswung the boat round and let the full stream bear them down again\nwhither it would, their quest now happily ended.\n\n‘I feel strangely tired, Rat,’ said the Mole, leaning wearily over his\noars as the boat drifted. ‘It’s being up all night, you’ll say, perhaps;\nbut that’s nothing. We do as much half the nights of the week, at this\ntime of the year. No; I feel as if I had been through something very\nexciting and rather terrible, and it was just over; and yet nothing\nparticular has happened.’\n\n‘Or something very surprising and splendid and beautiful,’ murmured the\nRat, leaning back and closing his eyes. ‘I feel just as you do, Mole;\nsimply dead tired, though not body tired. It’s lucky we’ve got the\nstream with us, to take us home. Isn’t it jolly to feel the sun again,\nsoaking into one’s bones! And hark to the wind playing in the reeds!’\n\n‘It’s like music--far away music,’ said the Mole nodding drowsily.\n\n‘So I was thinking,’ murmured the Rat, dreamful and languid.\n‘Dance-music--the lilting sort that runs on without a stop--but with\nwords in it, too--it passes into words and out of them again--I catch\nthem at intervals--then it is dance-music once more, and then nothing\nbut the reeds’ soft thin whispering.’\n\n‘You hear better than I,’ said the Mole sadly. ‘I cannot catch the\nwords.’\n\n‘Let me try and give you them,’ said the Rat softly, his eyes still\nclosed. ‘Now it is turning into words again--faint but clear--Lest the\nawe should dwell--And turn your frolic to fret--You shall look on my\npower at the helping hour--But then you shall forget! Now the reeds take\nit up--forget, forget, they sigh, and it dies away in a rustle and a\nwhisper. Then the voice returns--\n\n‘Lest limbs be reddened and rent--I spring the trap that is set--As I\nloose the snare you may glimpse me there--For surely you shall forget!\nRow nearer, Mole, nearer to the reeds! It is hard to catch, and grows\neach minute fainter.\n\n‘Helper and healer, I cheer--Small waifs in the woodland wet--Strays I\nfind in it, wounds I bind in it--Bidding them all forget! Nearer, Mole,\nnearer! No, it is no good; the song has died away into reed-talk.’\n\n‘But what do the words mean?’ asked the wondering Mole.\n\n‘That I do not know,’ said the Rat simply. ‘I passed them on to you\nas they reached me. Ah! now they return again, and this time full and\nclear! This time, at last, it is the real, the unmistakable thing,\nsimple--passionate--perfect----’\n\n‘Well, let’s have it, then,’ said the Mole, after he had waited\npatiently for a few minutes, half-dozing in the hot sun.\n\nBut no answer came. He looked, and understood the silence. With a smile\nof much happiness on his face, and something of a listening look still\nlingering there, the weary Rat was fast asleep.\n\n\n\n\nVIII. TOAD’S ADVENTURES\n\nWhen Toad found himself immured in a dank and noisome dungeon, and knew\nthat all the grim darkness of a medieval fortress lay between him and\nthe outer world of sunshine and well-metalled high roads where he had\nlately been so happy, disporting himself as if he had bought up every\nroad in England, he flung himself at full length on the floor, and shed\nbitter tears, and abandoned himself to dark despair. ‘This is the end\nof everything’ (he said), ‘at least it is the end of the career of Toad,\nwhich is the same thing; the popular and handsome Toad, the rich and\nhospitable Toad, the Toad so free and careless and debonair! How can I\nhope to be ever set at large again’ (he said), ‘who have been imprisoned\nso justly for stealing so handsome a motor-car in such an audacious\nmanner, and for such lurid and imaginative cheek, bestowed upon such a\nnumber of fat, red-faced policemen!’ (Here his sobs choked him.) ‘Stupid\nanimal that I was’ (he said), ‘now I must languish in this dungeon, till\npeople who were proud to say they knew me, have forgotten the very name\nof Toad! O wise old Badger!’ (he said), ‘O clever, intelligent Rat and\nsensible Mole! What sound judgments, what a knowledge of men and matters\nyou possess! O unhappy and forsaken Toad!’ With lamentations such as\nthese he passed his days and nights for several weeks, refusing his\nmeals or intermediate light refreshments, though the grim and ancient\ngaoler, knowing that Toad’s pockets were well lined, frequently pointed\nout that many comforts, and indeed luxuries, could by arrangement be\nsent in--at a price--from outside.\n\nNow the gaoler had a daughter, a pleasant wench and good-hearted,\nwho assisted her father in the lighter duties of his post. She was\nparticularly fond of animals, and, besides her canary, whose cage hung\non a nail in the massive wall of the keep by day, to the great annoyance\nof prisoners who relished an after-dinner nap, and was shrouded in an\nantimacassar on the parlour table at night, she kept several piebald\nmice and a restless revolving squirrel. This kind-hearted girl, pitying\nthe misery of Toad, said to her father one day, ‘Father! I can’t bear to\nsee that poor beast so unhappy, and getting so thin! You let me have the\nmanaging of him. You know how fond of animals I am. I’ll make him eat\nfrom my hand, and sit up, and do all sorts of things.’\n\nHer father replied that she could do what she liked with him. He was\ntired of Toad, and his sulks and his airs and his meanness. So that day\nshe went on her errand of mercy, and knocked at the door of Toad’s cell.\n\n‘Now, cheer up, Toad,’ she said, coaxingly, on entering, ‘and sit up\nand dry your eyes and be a sensible animal. And do try and eat a bit of\ndinner. See, I’ve brought you some of mine, hot from the oven!’\n\nIt was bubble-and-squeak, between two plates, and its fragrance filled\nthe narrow cell. The penetrating smell of cabbage reached the nose of\nToad as he lay prostrate in his misery on the floor, and gave him the\nidea for a moment that perhaps life was not such a blank and desperate\nthing as he had imagined. But still he wailed, and kicked with his legs,\nand refused to be comforted. So the wise girl retired for the time, but,\nof course, a good deal of the smell of hot cabbage remained behind,\nas it will do, and Toad, between his sobs, sniffed and reflected, and\ngradually began to think new and inspiring thoughts: of chivalry,\nand poetry, and deeds still to be done; of broad meadows, and cattle\nbrowsing in them, raked by sun and wind; of kitchen-gardens, and\nstraight herb-borders, and warm snap-dragon beset by bees; and of the\ncomforting clink of dishes set down on the table at Toad Hall, and the\nscrape of chair-legs on the floor as every one pulled himself close up\nto his work. The air of the narrow cell took a rosy tinge; he began to\nthink of his friends, and how they would surely be able to do something;\nof lawyers, and how they would have enjoyed his case, and what an ass\nhe had been not to get in a few; and lastly, he thought of his own great\ncleverness and resource, and all that he was capable of if he only gave\nhis great mind to it; and the cure was almost complete.\n\nWhen the girl returned, some hours later, she carried a tray, with a\ncup of fragrant tea steaming on it; and a plate piled up with very hot\nbuttered toast, cut thick, very brown on both sides, with the butter\nrunning through the holes in it in great golden drops, like honey from\nthe honeycomb. The smell of that buttered toast simply talked to Toad,\nand with no uncertain voice; talked of warm kitchens, of breakfasts on\nbright frosty mornings, of cosy parlour firesides on winter evenings,\nwhen one’s ramble was over and slippered feet were propped on the\nfender; of the purring of contented cats, and the twitter of sleepy\ncanaries. Toad sat up on end once more, dried his eyes, sipped his tea\nand munched his toast, and soon began talking freely about himself, and\nthe house he lived in, and his doings there, and how important he was,\nand what a lot his friends thought of him.\n\nThe gaoler’s daughter saw that the topic was doing him as much good as\nthe tea, as indeed it was, and encouraged him to go on.\n\n‘Tell me about Toad Hall,’ said she. ‘It sounds beautiful.’\n\n‘Toad Hall,’ said the Toad proudly, ‘is an eligible self-contained\ngentleman’s residence very unique; dating in part from the fourteenth\ncentury, but replete with every modern convenience. Up-to-date\nsanitation. Five minutes from church, post-office, and golf-links,\nSuitable for----’\n\n‘Bless the animal,’ said the girl, laughing, ‘I don’t want to TAKE it.\nTell me something REAL about it. But first wait till I fetch you some\nmore tea and toast.’\n\nShe tripped away, and presently returned with a fresh trayful; and Toad,\npitching into the toast with avidity, his spirits quite restored to\ntheir usual level, told her about the boathouse, and the fish-pond, and\nthe old walled kitchen-garden; and about the pig-styes, and the stables,\nand the pigeon-house, and the hen-house; and about the dairy, and the\nwash-house, and the china-cupboards, and the linen-presses (she liked\nthat bit especially); and about the banqueting-hall, and the fun they\nhad there when the other animals were gathered round the table and Toad\nwas at his best, singing songs, telling stories, carrying on generally.\nThen she wanted to know about his animal-friends, and was very\ninterested in all he had to tell her about them and how they lived, and\nwhat they did to pass their time. Of course, she did not say she was\nfond of animals as PETS, because she had the sense to see that Toad\nwould be extremely offended. When she said good night, having filled his\nwater-jug and shaken up his straw for him, Toad was very much the same\nsanguine, self-satisfied animal that he had been of old. He sang a\nlittle song or two, of the sort he used to sing at his dinner-parties,\ncurled himself up in the straw, and had an excellent night’s rest and\nthe pleasantest of dreams.\n\nThey had many interesting talks together, after that, as the dreary days\nwent on; and the gaoler’s daughter grew very sorry for Toad, and thought\nit a great shame that a poor little animal should be locked up in prison\nfor what seemed to her a very trivial offence. Toad, of course, in\nhis vanity, thought that her interest in him proceeded from a growing\ntenderness; and he could not help half-regretting that the social gulf\nbetween them was so very wide, for she was a comely lass, and evidently\nadmired him very much.\n\nOne morning the girl was very thoughtful, and answered at random, and\ndid not seem to Toad to be paying proper attention to his witty sayings\nand sparkling comments.\n\n‘Toad,’ she said presently, ‘just listen, please. I have an aunt who is\na washerwoman.’\n\n‘There, there,’ said Toad, graciously and affably, ‘never mind; think no\nmore about it. _I_ have several aunts who OUGHT to be washerwomen.’\n\n‘Do be quiet a minute, Toad,’ said the girl. ‘You talk too much, that’s\nyour chief fault, and I’m trying to think, and you hurt my head. As I\nsaid, I have an aunt who is a washerwoman; she does the washing for all\nthe prisoners in this castle--we try to keep any paying business of that\nsort in the family, you understand. She takes out the washing on Monday\nmorning, and brings it in on Friday evening. This is a Thursday. Now,\nthis is what occurs to me: you’re very rich--at least you’re always\ntelling me so--and she’s very poor. A few pounds wouldn’t make any\ndifference to you, and it would mean a lot to her. Now, I think if she\nwere properly approached--squared, I believe is the word you animals\nuse--you could come to some arrangement by which she would let you have\nher dress and bonnet and so on, and you could escape from the\ncastle as the official washerwoman. You’re very alike in many\nrespects--particularly about the figure.’\n\n‘We’re NOT,’ said the Toad in a huff. ‘I have a very elegant figure--for\nwhat I am.’\n\n‘So has my aunt,’ replied the girl, ‘for what SHE is. But have it your\nown way. You horrid, proud, ungrateful animal, when I’m sorry for you,\nand trying to help you!’\n\n‘Yes, yes, that’s all right; thank you very much indeed,’ said the Toad\nhurriedly. ‘But look here! you wouldn’t surely have Mr. Toad of Toad\nHall, going about the country disguised as a washerwoman!’\n\n‘Then you can stop here as a Toad,’ replied the girl with much spirit.\n‘I suppose you want to go off in a coach-and-four!’\n\nHonest Toad was always ready to admit himself in the wrong. ‘You are a\ngood, kind, clever girl,’ he said, ‘and I am indeed a proud and a stupid\ntoad. Introduce me to your worthy aunt, if you will be so kind, and\nI have no doubt that the excellent lady and I will be able to arrange\nterms satisfactory to both parties.’\n\nNext evening the girl ushered her aunt into Toad’s cell, bearing his\nweek’s washing pinned up in a towel. The old lady had been prepared\nbeforehand for the interview, and the sight of certain gold sovereigns\nthat Toad had thoughtfully placed on the table in full view practically\ncompleted the matter and left little further to discuss. In return for\nhis cash, Toad received a cotton print gown, an apron, a shawl, and a\nrusty black bonnet; the only stipulation the old lady made being that\nshe should be gagged and bound and dumped down in a corner. By this not\nvery convincing artifice, she explained, aided by picturesque fiction\nwhich she could supply herself, she hoped to retain her situation, in\nspite of the suspicious appearance of things.\n\nToad was delighted with the suggestion. It would enable him to leave the\nprison in some style, and with his reputation for being a desperate\nand dangerous fellow untarnished; and he readily helped the gaoler’s\ndaughter to make her aunt appear as much as possible the victim of\ncircumstances over which she had no control.\n\n‘Now it’s your turn, Toad,’ said the girl. ‘Take off that coat and\nwaistcoat of yours; you’re fat enough as it is.’\n\nShaking with laughter, she proceeded to ‘hook-and-eye’ him into the\ncotton print gown, arranged the shawl with a professional fold, and tied\nthe strings of the rusty bonnet under his chin.\n\n‘You’re the very image of her,’ she giggled, ‘only I’m sure you never\nlooked half so respectable in all your life before. Now, good-bye, Toad,\nand good luck. Go straight down the way you came up; and if any one says\nanything to you, as they probably will, being but men, you can chaff\nback a bit, of course, but remember you’re a widow woman, quite alone in\nthe world, with a character to lose.’\n\nWith a quaking heart, but as firm a footstep as he could command,\nToad set forth cautiously on what seemed to be a most hare-brained and\nhazardous undertaking; but he was soon agreeably surprised to find how\neasy everything was made for him, and a little humbled at the thought\nthat both his popularity, and the sex that seemed to inspire it, were\nreally another’s. The washerwoman’s squat figure in its familiar cotton\nprint seemed a passport for every barred door and grim gateway; even\nwhen he hesitated, uncertain as to the right turning to take, he found\nhimself helped out of his difficulty by the warder at the next gate,\nanxious to be off to his tea, summoning him to come along sharp and not\nkeep him waiting there all night. The chaff and the humourous sallies\nto which he was subjected, and to which, of course, he had to provide\nprompt and effective reply, formed, indeed, his chief danger; for Toad\nwas an animal with a strong sense of his own dignity, and the chaff\nwas mostly (he thought) poor and clumsy, and the humour of the sallies\nentirely lacking. However, he kept his temper, though with great\ndifficulty, suited his retorts to his company and his supposed\ncharacter, and did his best not to overstep the limits of good taste.\n\nIt seemed hours before he crossed the last courtyard, rejected the\npressing invitations from the last guardroom, and dodged the outspread\narms of the last warder, pleading with simulated passion for just one\nfarewell embrace. But at last he heard the wicket-gate in the great\nouter door click behind him, felt the fresh air of the outer world upon\nhis anxious brow, and knew that he was free!\n\nDizzy with the easy success of his daring exploit, he walked quickly\ntowards the lights of the town, not knowing in the least what he should\ndo next, only quite certain of one thing, that he must remove himself as\nquickly as possible from the neighbourhood where the lady he was forced\nto represent was so well-known and so popular a character.\n\nAs he walked along, considering, his attention was caught by some red\nand green lights a little way off, to one side of the town, and the\nsound of the puffing and snorting of engines and the banging of shunted\ntrucks fell on his ear. ‘Aha!’ he thought, ‘this is a piece of luck!\nA railway station is the thing I want most in the whole world at this\nmoment; and what’s more, I needn’t go through the town to get it, and\nshan’t have to support this humiliating character by repartees which,\nthough thoroughly effective, do not assist one’s sense of self-respect.’\n\nHe made his way to the station accordingly, consulted a time-table, and\nfound that a train, bound more or less in the direction of his home, was\ndue to start in half-an-hour. ‘More luck!’ said Toad, his spirits rising\nrapidly, and went off to the booking-office to buy his ticket.\n\nHe gave the name of the station that he knew to be nearest to the\nvillage of which Toad Hall was the principal feature, and mechanically\nput his fingers, in search of the necessary money, where his waistcoat\npocket should have been. But here the cotton gown, which had nobly\nstood by him so far, and which he had basely forgotten, intervened, and\nfrustrated his efforts. In a sort of nightmare he struggled with the\nstrange uncanny thing that seemed to hold his hands, turn all muscular\nstrivings to water, and laugh at him all the time; while other\ntravellers, forming up in a line behind, waited with impatience,\nmaking suggestions of more or less value and comments of more or less\nstringency and point. At last--somehow--he never rightly understood\nhow--he burst the barriers, attained the goal, arrived at where all\nwaistcoat pockets are eternally situated, and found--not only no money,\nbut no pocket to hold it, and no waistcoat to hold the pocket!\n\nTo his horror he recollected that he had left both coat and waistcoat\nbehind him in his cell, and with them his pocket-book, money, keys,\nwatch, matches, pencil-case--all that makes life worth living, all that\ndistinguishes the many-pocketed animal, the lord of creation, from the\ninferior one-pocketed or no-pocketed productions that hop or trip about\npermissively, unequipped for the real contest.\n\nIn his misery he made one desperate effort to carry the thing off, and,\nwith a return to his fine old manner--a blend of the Squire and the\nCollege Don--he said, ‘Look here! I find I’ve left my purse behind. Just\ngive me that ticket, will you, and I’ll send the money on to-morrow? I’m\nwell-known in these parts.’\n\nThe clerk stared at him and the rusty black bonnet a moment, and then\nlaughed. ‘I should think you were pretty well known in these parts,’\nhe said, ‘if you’ve tried this game on often. Here, stand away from the\nwindow, please, madam; you’re obstructing the other passengers!’\n\nAn old gentleman who had been prodding him in the back for some moments\nhere thrust him away, and, what was worse, addressed him as his good\nwoman, which angered Toad more than anything that had occurred that\nevening.\n\nBaffled and full of despair, he wandered blindly down the platform where\nthe train was standing, and tears trickled down each side of his nose.\nIt was hard, he thought, to be within sight of safety and almost of\nhome, and to be baulked by the want of a few wretched shillings and by\nthe pettifogging mistrustfulness of paid officials. Very soon his escape\nwould be discovered, the hunt would be up, he would be caught, reviled,\nloaded with chains, dragged back again to prison and bread-and-water and\nstraw; his guards and penalties would be doubled; and O, what sarcastic\nremarks the girl would make! What was to be done? He was not swift of\nfoot; his figure was unfortunately recognisable. Could he not squeeze\nunder the seat of a carriage? He had seen this method adopted by\nschoolboys, when the journey-money provided by thoughtful parents had\nbeen diverted to other and better ends. As he pondered, he found\nhimself opposite the engine, which was being oiled, wiped, and generally\ncaressed by its affectionate driver, a burly man with an oil-can in one\nhand and a lump of cotton-waste in the other.\n\n‘Hullo, mother!’ said the engine-driver, ‘what’s the trouble? You don’t\nlook particularly cheerful.’\n\n‘O, sir!’ said Toad, crying afresh, ‘I am a poor unhappy washerwoman,\nand I’ve lost all my money, and can’t pay for a ticket, and I must get\nhome to-night somehow, and whatever I am to do I don’t know. O dear, O\ndear!’\n\n‘That’s a bad business, indeed,’ said the engine-driver reflectively.\n‘Lost your money--and can’t get home--and got some kids, too, waiting\nfor you, I dare say?’\n\n‘Any amount of ‘em,’ sobbed Toad. ‘And they’ll be hungry--and\nplaying with matches--and upsetting lamps, the little innocents!--and\nquarrelling, and going on generally. O dear, O dear!’\n\n‘Well, I’ll tell you what I’ll do,’ said the good engine-driver. ‘You’re\na washerwoman to your trade, says you. Very well, that’s that. And\nI’m an engine-driver, as you well may see, and there’s no denying it’s\nterribly dirty work. Uses up a power of shirts, it does, till my missus\nis fair tired of washing of ‘em. If you’ll wash a few shirts for me when\nyou get home, and send ‘em along, I’ll give you a ride on my engine.\nIt’s against the Company’s regulations, but we’re not so very particular\nin these out-of-the-way parts.’\n\nThe Toad’s misery turned into rapture as he eagerly scrambled up into\nthe cab of the engine. Of course, he had never washed a shirt in his\nlife, and couldn’t if he tried and, anyhow, he wasn’t going to begin;\nbut he thought: ‘When I get safely home to Toad Hall, and have money\nagain, and pockets to put it in, I will send the engine-driver enough to\npay for quite a quantity of washing, and that will be the same thing, or\nbetter.’\n\nThe guard waved his welcome flag, the engine-driver whistled in\ncheerful response, and the train moved out of the station. As the speed\nincreased, and the Toad could see on either side of him real fields, and\ntrees, and hedges, and cows, and horses, all flying past him, and as\nhe thought how every minute was bringing him nearer to Toad Hall, and\nsympathetic friends, and money to chink in his pocket, and a soft bed\nto sleep in, and good things to eat, and praise and admiration at the\nrecital of his adventures and his surpassing cleverness, he began to\nskip up and down and shout and sing snatches of song, to the great\nastonishment of the engine-driver, who had come across washerwomen\nbefore, at long intervals, but never one at all like this.\n\nThey had covered many and many a mile, and Toad was already considering\nwhat he would have for supper as soon as he got home, when he noticed\nthat the engine-driver, with a puzzled expression on his face, was\nleaning over the side of the engine and listening hard. Then he saw him\nclimb on to the coals and gaze out over the top of the train; then he\nreturned and said to Toad: ‘It’s very strange; we’re the last train\nrunning in this direction to-night, yet I could be sworn that I heard\nanother following us!’\n\nToad ceased his frivolous antics at once. He became grave and depressed,\nand a dull pain in the lower part of his spine, communicating itself to\nhis legs, made him want to sit down and try desperately not to think of\nall the possibilities.\n\nBy this time the moon was shining brightly, and the engine-driver,\nsteadying himself on the coal, could command a view of the line behind\nthem for a long distance.\n\nPresently he called out, ‘I can see it clearly now! It is an engine, on\nour rails, coming along at a great pace! It looks as if we were being\npursued!’\n\nThe miserable Toad, crouching in the coal-dust, tried hard to think of\nsomething to do, with dismal want of success.\n\n‘They are gaining on us fast!’ cried the engine-driver. And the engine\nis crowded with the queerest lot of people! Men like ancient warders,\nwaving halberds; policemen in their helmets, waving truncheons; and\nshabbily dressed men in pot-hats, obvious and unmistakable plain-clothes\ndetectives even at this distance, waving revolvers and walking-sticks;\nall waving, and all shouting the same thing--“Stop, stop, stop!”’\n\nThen Toad fell on his knees among the coals and, raising his clasped\npaws in supplication, cried, ‘Save me, only save me, dear kind Mr.\nEngine-driver, and I will confess everything! I am not the simple\nwasherwoman I seem to be! I have no children waiting for me, innocent\nor otherwise! I am a toad--the well-known and popular Mr. Toad, a landed\nproprietor; I have just escaped, by my great daring and cleverness, from\na loathsome dungeon into which my enemies had flung me; and if\nthose fellows on that engine recapture me, it will be chains and\nbread-and-water and straw and misery once more for poor, unhappy,\ninnocent Toad!’\n\nThe engine-driver looked down upon him very sternly, and said, ‘Now tell\nthe truth; what were you put in prison for?’\n\n‘It was nothing very much,’ said poor Toad, colouring deeply. ‘I only\nborrowed a motorcar while the owners were at lunch; they had no need\nof it at the time. I didn’t mean to steal it, really; but\npeople--especially magistrates--take such harsh views of thoughtless and\nhigh-spirited actions.’\n\nThe engine-driver looked very grave and said, ‘I fear that you have been\nindeed a wicked toad, and by rights I ought to give you up to offended\njustice. But you are evidently in sore trouble and distress, so I will\nnot desert you. I don’t hold with motor-cars, for one thing; and I don’t\nhold with being ordered about by policemen when I’m on my own engine,\nfor another. And the sight of an animal in tears always makes me feel\nqueer and softhearted. So cheer up, Toad! I’ll do my best, and we may\nbeat them yet!’\n\nThey piled on more coals, shovelling furiously; the furnace roared, the\nsparks flew, the engine leapt and swung but still their pursuers slowly\ngained. The engine-driver, with a sigh, wiped his brow with a handful\nof cotton-waste, and said, ‘I’m afraid it’s no good, Toad. You see, they\nare running light, and they have the better engine. There’s just one\nthing left for us to do, and it’s your only chance, so attend very\ncarefully to what I tell you. A short way ahead of us is a long tunnel,\nand on the other side of that the line passes through a thick wood.\nNow, I will put on all the speed I can while we are running through the\ntunnel, but the other fellows will slow down a bit, naturally, for fear\nof an accident. When we are through, I will shut off steam and put on\nbrakes as hard as I can, and the moment it’s safe to do so you must jump\nand hide in the wood, before they get through the tunnel and see you.\nThen I will go full speed ahead again, and they can chase me if they\nlike, for as long as they like, and as far as they like. Now mind and be\nready to jump when I tell you!’\n\nThey piled on more coals, and the train shot into the tunnel, and the\nengine rushed and roared and rattled, till at last they shot out at the\nother end into fresh air and the peaceful moonlight, and saw the wood\nlying dark and helpful upon either side of the line. The driver shut off\nsteam and put on brakes, the Toad got down on the step, and as the train\nslowed down to almost a walking pace he heard the driver call out, ‘Now,\njump!’\n\nToad jumped, rolled down a short embankment, picked himself up unhurt,\nscrambled into the wood and hid.\n\nPeeping out, he saw his train get up speed again and disappear at a\ngreat pace. Then out of the tunnel burst the pursuing engine, roaring\nand whistling, her motley crew waving their various weapons and\nshouting, ‘Stop! stop! stop!’ When they were past, the Toad had a hearty\nlaugh--for the first time since he was thrown into prison.\n\nBut he soon stopped laughing when he came to consider that it was now\nvery late and dark and cold, and he was in an unknown wood, with no\nmoney and no chance of supper, and still far from friends and home; and\nthe dead silence of everything, after the roar and rattle of the train,\nwas something of a shock. He dared not leave the shelter of the trees,\nso he struck into the wood, with the idea of leaving the railway as far\nas possible behind him.\n\nAfter so many weeks within walls, he found the wood strange and\nunfriendly and inclined, he thought, to make fun of him. Night-jars,\nsounding their mechanical rattle, made him think that the wood was full\nof searching warders, closing in on him. An owl, swooping noiselessly\ntowards him, brushed his shoulder with its wing, making him jump with\nthe horrid certainty that it was a hand; then flitted off, moth-like,\nlaughing its low ho! ho! ho; which Toad thought in very poor taste. Once\nhe met a fox, who stopped, looked him up and down in a sarcastic sort\nof way, and said, ‘Hullo, washerwoman! Half a pair of socks and a\npillow-case short this week! Mind it doesn’t occur again!’ and swaggered\noff, sniggering. Toad looked about for a stone to throw at him, but\ncould not succeed in finding one, which vexed him more than anything.\nAt last, cold, hungry, and tired out, he sought the shelter of a hollow\ntree, where with branches and dead leaves he made himself as comfortable\na bed as he could, and slept soundly till the morning.\n\n\n\n\nIX. WAYFARERS ALL\n\nThe Water Rat was restless, and he did not exactly know why. To all\nappearance the summer’s pomp was still at fullest height, and although\nin the tilled acres green had given way to gold, though rowans were\nreddening, and the woods were dashed here and there with a tawny\nfierceness, yet light and warmth and colour were still present in\nundiminished measure, clean of any chilly premonitions of the passing\nyear. But the constant chorus of the orchards and hedges had shrunk to\na casual evensong from a few yet unwearied performers; the robin was\nbeginning to assert himself once more; and there was a feeling in\nthe air of change and departure. The cuckoo, of course, had long been\nsilent; but many another feathered friend, for months a part of the\nfamiliar landscape and its small society, was missing too and it seemed\nthat the ranks thinned steadily day by day. Rat, ever observant of all\nwinged movement, saw that it was taking daily a southing tendency; and\neven as he lay in bed at night he thought he could make out, passing\nin the darkness overhead, the beat and quiver of impatient pinions,\nobedient to the peremptory call.\n\nNature’s Grand Hotel has its Season, like the others. As the guests one\nby one pack, pay, and depart, and the seats at the table-d’hote shrink\npitifully at each succeeding meal; as suites of rooms are closed,\ncarpets taken up, and waiters sent away; those boarders who are staying\non, en pension, until the next year’s full re-opening, cannot help\nbeing somewhat affected by all these flittings and farewells, this eager\ndiscussion of plans, routes, and fresh quarters, this daily shrinkage in\nthe stream of comradeship. One gets unsettled, depressed, and inclined\nto be querulous. Why this craving for change? Why not stay on quietly\nhere, like us, and be jolly? You don’t know this hotel out of the\nseason, and what fun we have among ourselves, we fellows who remain and\nsee the whole interesting year out. All very true, no doubt the others\nalways reply; we quite envy you--and some other year perhaps--but just\nnow we have engagements--and there’s the bus at the door--our time is\nup! So they depart, with a smile and a nod, and we miss them, and feel\nresentful. The Rat was a self-sufficing sort of animal, rooted to the\nland, and, whoever went, he stayed; still, he could not help noticing\nwhat was in the air, and feeling some of its influence in his bones.\n\nIt was difficult to settle down to anything seriously, with all this\nflitting going on. Leaving the water-side, where rushes stood thick\nand tall in a stream that was becoming sluggish and low, he wandered\ncountry-wards, crossed a field or two of pasturage already looking dusty\nand parched, and thrust into the great sea of wheat, yellow, wavy, and\nmurmurous, full of quiet motion and small whisperings. Here he often\nloved to wander, through the forest of stiff strong stalks that carried\ntheir own golden sky away over his head--a sky that was always dancing,\nshimmering, softly talking; or swaying strongly to the passing wind and\nrecovering itself with a toss and a merry laugh. Here, too, he had\nmany small friends, a society complete in itself, leading full and busy\nlives, but always with a spare moment to gossip, and exchange news with\na visitor. Today, however, though they were civil enough, the field-mice\nand harvest-mice seemed preoccupied. Many were digging and tunnelling\nbusily; others, gathered together in small groups, examined plans\nand drawings of small flats, stated to be desirable and compact, and\nsituated conveniently near the Stores. Some were hauling out dusty\ntrunks and dress-baskets, others were already elbow-deep packing their\nbelongings; while everywhere piles and bundles of wheat, oats, barley,\nbeech-mast and nuts, lay about ready for transport.\n\n‘Here’s old Ratty!’ they cried as soon as they saw him. ‘Come and bear a\nhand, Rat, and don’t stand about idle!’\n\n‘What sort of games are you up to?’ said the Water Rat severely. ‘You\nknow it isn’t time to be thinking of winter quarters yet, by a long\nway!’\n\n‘O yes, we know that,’ explained a field-mouse rather shamefacedly; ‘but\nit’s always as well to be in good time, isn’t it? We really MUST get\nall the furniture and baggage and stores moved out of this before those\nhorrid machines begin clicking round the fields; and then, you know,\nthe best flats get picked up so quickly nowadays, and if you’re late you\nhave to put up with ANYTHING; and they want such a lot of doing up, too,\nbefore they’re fit to move into. Of course, we’re early, we know that;\nbut we’re only just making a start.’\n\n‘O, bother STARTS,’ said the Rat. ‘It’s a splendid day. Come for a row,\nor a stroll along the hedges, or a picnic in the woods, or something.’\n\n‘Well, I THINK not TO-DAY, thank you,’ replied the field-mouse\nhurriedly. ‘Perhaps some OTHER day--when we’ve more TIME----’\n\nThe Rat, with a snort of contempt, swung round to go, tripped over a\nhat-box, and fell, with undignified remarks.\n\n‘If people would be more careful,’ said a field-mouse rather stiffly,\n‘and look where they’re going, people wouldn’t hurt themselves--and\nforget themselves. Mind that hold-all, Rat! You’d better sit down\nsomewhere. In an hour or two we may be more free to attend to you.’\n\n‘You won’t be “free” as you call it much this side of Christmas, I can\nsee that,’ retorted the Rat grumpily, as he picked his way out of the\nfield.\n\nHe returned somewhat despondently to his river again--his faithful,\nsteady-going old river, which never packed up, flitted, or went into\nwinter quarters.\n\nIn the osiers which fringed the bank he spied a swallow sitting.\nPresently it was joined by another, and then by a third; and the birds,\nfidgeting restlessly on their bough, talked together earnestly and low.\n\n‘What, ALREADY,’ said the Rat, strolling up to them. ‘What’s the hurry?\nI call it simply ridiculous.’\n\n‘O, we’re not off yet, if that’s what you mean,’ replied the first\nswallow. ‘We’re only making plans and arranging things. Talking it over,\nyou know--what route we’re taking this year, and where we’ll stop, and\nso on. That’s half the fun!’\n\n‘Fun?’ said the Rat; ‘now that’s just what I don’t understand. If you’ve\nGOT to leave this pleasant place, and your friends who will miss you,\nand your snug homes that you’ve just settled into, why, when the hour\nstrikes I’ve no doubt you’ll go bravely, and face all the trouble and\ndiscomfort and change and newness, and make believe that you’re not very\nunhappy. But to want to talk about it, or even think about it, till you\nreally need----’\n\n‘No, you don’t understand, naturally,’ said the second swallow. ‘First,\nwe feel it stirring within us, a sweet unrest; then back come the\nrecollections one by one, like homing pigeons. They flutter through our\ndreams at night, they fly with us in our wheelings and circlings by\nday. We hunger to inquire of each other, to compare notes and assure\nourselves that it was all really true, as one by one the scents and\nsounds and names of long-forgotten places come gradually back and beckon\nto us.’\n\n‘Couldn’t you stop on for just this year?’ suggested the Water Rat,\nwistfully. ‘We’ll all do our best to make you feel at home. You’ve no\nidea what good times we have here, while you are far away.’\n\n‘I tried “stopping on” one year,’ said the third swallow. ‘I had grown\nso fond of the place that when the time came I hung back and let the\nothers go on without me. For a few weeks it was all well enough, but\nafterwards, O the weary length of the nights! The shivering, sunless\ndays! The air so clammy and chill, and not an insect in an acre of it!\nNo, it was no good; my courage broke down, and one cold, stormy night I\ntook wing, flying well inland on account of the strong easterly gales.\nIt was snowing hard as I beat through the passes of the great mountains,\nand I had a stiff fight to win through; but never shall I forget the\nblissful feeling of the hot sun again on my back as I sped down to the\nlakes that lay so blue and placid below me, and the taste of my first\nfat insect! The past was like a bad dream; the future was all happy\nholiday as I moved southwards week by week, easily, lazily, lingering as\nlong as I dared, but always heeding the call! No, I had had my warning;\nnever again did I think of disobedience.’\n\n‘Ah, yes, the call of the South, of the South!’ twittered the other two\ndreamily. ‘Its songs its hues, its radiant air! O, do you remember----’\nand, forgetting the Rat, they slid into passionate reminiscence, while\nhe listened fascinated, and his heart burned within him. In himself,\ntoo, he knew that it was vibrating at last, that chord hitherto dormant\nand unsuspected. The mere chatter of these southern-bound birds, their\npale and second-hand reports, had yet power to awaken this wild new\nsensation and thrill him through and through with it; what would one\nmoment of the real thing work in him--one passionate touch of the real\nsouthern sun, one waft of the authentic odor? With closed eyes he dared\nto dream a moment in full abandonment, and when he looked again the\nriver seemed steely and chill, the green fields grey and lightless. Then\nhis loyal heart seemed to cry out on his weaker self for its treachery.\n\n‘Why do you ever come back, then, at all?’ he demanded of the swallows\njealously. ‘What do you find to attract you in this poor drab little\ncountry?’\n\n‘And do you think,’ said the first swallow, ‘that the other call is\nnot for us too, in its due season? The call of lush meadow-grass, wet\norchards, warm, insect-haunted ponds, of browsing cattle, of haymaking,\nand all the farm-buildings clustering round the House of the perfect\nEaves?’\n\n‘Do you suppose,’ asked the second one, that you are the only living\nthing that craves with a hungry longing to hear the cuckoo’s note\nagain?’\n\n‘In due time,’ said the third, ‘we shall be home-sick once more for\nquiet water-lilies swaying on the surface of an English stream. But\nto-day all that seems pale and thin and very far away. Just now our\nblood dances to other music.’\n\nThey fell a-twittering among themselves once more, and this time their\nintoxicating babble was of violet seas, tawny sands, and lizard-haunted\nwalls.\n\nRestlessly the Rat wandered off once more, climbed the slope that rose\ngently from the north bank of the river, and lay looking out towards\nthe great ring of Downs that barred his vision further southwards--his\nsimple horizon hitherto, his Mountains of the Moon, his limit behind\nwhich lay nothing he had cared to see or to know. To-day, to him gazing\nSouth with a new-born need stirring in his heart, the clear sky over\ntheir long low outline seemed to pulsate with promise; to-day, the\nunseen was everything, the unknown the only real fact of life. On this\nside of the hills was now the real blank, on the other lay the crowded\nand coloured panorama that his inner eye was seeing so clearly. What\nseas lay beyond, green, leaping, and crested! What sun-bathed coasts,\nalong which the white villas glittered against the olive woods! What\nquiet harbours, thronged with gallant shipping bound for purple islands\nof wine and spice, islands set low in languorous waters!\n\nHe rose and descended river-wards once more; then changed his mind\nand sought the side of the dusty lane. There, lying half-buried in the\nthick, cool under-hedge tangle that bordered it, he could muse on the\nmetalled road and all the wondrous world that it led to; on all the\nwayfarers, too, that might have trodden it, and the fortunes and\nadventures they had gone to seek or found unseeking--out there,\nbeyond--beyond!\n\nFootsteps fell on his ear, and the figure of one that walked somewhat\nwearily came into view; and he saw that it was a Rat, and a very dusty\none. The wayfarer, as he reached him, saluted with a gesture of courtesy\nthat had something foreign about it--hesitated a moment--then with a\npleasant smile turned from the track and sat down by his side in the\ncool herbage. He seemed tired, and the Rat let him rest unquestioned,\nunderstanding something of what was in his thoughts; knowing, too, the\nvalue all animals attach at times to mere silent companionship, when the\nweary muscles slacken and the mind marks time.\n\nThe wayfarer was lean and keen-featured, and somewhat bowed at the\nshoulders; his paws were thin and long, his eyes much wrinkled at the\ncorners, and he wore small gold ear rings in his neatly-set well-shaped\nears. His knitted jersey was of a faded blue, his breeches, patched and\nstained, were based on a blue foundation, and his small belongings that\nhe carried were tied up in a blue cotton handkerchief.\n\nWhen he had rested awhile the stranger sighed, snuffed the air, and\nlooked about him.\n\n‘That was clover, that warm whiff on the breeze,’ he remarked; ‘and\nthose are cows we hear cropping the grass behind us and blowing softly\nbetween mouthfuls. There is a sound of distant reapers, and yonder\nrises a blue line of cottage smoke against the woodland. The river runs\nsomewhere close by, for I hear the call of a moorhen, and I see by your\nbuild that you’re a freshwater mariner. Everything seems asleep, and\nyet going on all the time. It is a goodly life that you lead, friend; no\ndoubt the best in the world, if only you are strong enough to lead it!’\n\n‘Yes, it’s THE life, the only life, to live,’ responded the Water Rat\ndreamily, and without his usual whole-hearted conviction.\n\n‘I did not say exactly that,’ replied the stranger cautiously; ‘but no\ndoubt it’s the best. I’ve tried it, and I know. And because I’ve just\ntried it--six months of it--and know it’s the best, here am I, footsore\nand hungry, tramping away from it, tramping southward, following the old\ncall, back to the old life, THE life which is mine and which will not\nlet me go.’\n\n‘Is this, then, yet another of them?’ mused the Rat. ‘And where have\nyou just come from?’ he asked. He hardly dared to ask where he was bound\nfor; he seemed to know the answer only too well.\n\n‘Nice little farm,’ replied the wayfarer, briefly. ‘Upalong in that\ndirection’--he nodded northwards. ‘Never mind about it. I had everything\nI could want--everything I had any right to expect of life, and more;\nand here I am! Glad to be here all the same, though, glad to be here!\nSo many miles further on the road, so many hours nearer to my heart’s\ndesire!’\n\nHis shining eyes held fast to the horizon, and he seemed to be listening\nfor some sound that was wanting from that inland acreage, vocal as it\nwas with the cheerful music of pasturage and farmyard.\n\n‘You are not one of US,’ said the Water Rat, ‘nor yet a farmer; nor\neven, I should judge, of this country.’\n\n‘Right,’ replied the stranger. ‘I’m a seafaring rat, I am, and the\nport I originally hail from is Constantinople, though I’m a sort of a\nforeigner there too, in a manner of speaking. You will have heard of\nConstantinople, friend? A fair city, and an ancient and glorious one.\nAnd you may have heard, too, of Sigurd, King of Norway, and how he\nsailed thither with sixty ships, and how he and his men rode up through\nstreets all canopied in their honour with purple and gold; and how the\nEmperor and Empress came down and banqueted with him on board his ship.\nWhen Sigurd returned home, many of his Northmen remained behind and\nentered the Emperor’s body-guard, and my ancestor, a Norwegian born,\nstayed behind too, with the ships that Sigurd gave the Emperor.\nSeafarers we have ever been, and no wonder; as for me, the city of my\nbirth is no more my home than any pleasant port between there and the\nLondon River. I know them all, and they know me. Set me down on any of\ntheir quays or foreshores, and I am home again.’\n\n‘I suppose you go great voyages,’ said the Water Rat with growing\ninterest. ‘Months and months out of sight of land, and provisions\nrunning short, and allowanced as to water, and your mind communing with\nthe mighty ocean, and all that sort of thing?’\n\n‘By no means,’ said the Sea Rat frankly. ‘Such a life as you describe\nwould not suit me at all. I’m in the coasting trade, and rarely out of\nsight of land. It’s the jolly times on shore that appeal to me, as much\nas any seafaring. O, those southern seaports! The smell of them, the\nriding-lights at night, the glamour!’\n\n‘Well, perhaps you have chosen the better way,’ said the Water Rat, but\nrather doubtfully. ‘Tell me something of your coasting, then, if you\nhave a mind to, and what sort of harvest an animal of spirit might hope\nto bring home from it to warm his latter days with gallant memories by\nthe fireside; for my life, I confess to you, feels to me to-day somewhat\nnarrow and circumscribed.’\n\n‘My last voyage,’ began the Sea Rat, ‘that landed me eventually in this\ncountry, bound with high hopes for my inland farm, will serve as a good\nexample of any of them, and, indeed, as an epitome of my highly-coloured\nlife. Family troubles, as usual, began it. The domestic storm-cone was\nhoisted, and I shipped myself on board a small trading vessel bound from\nConstantinople, by classic seas whose every wave throbs with a deathless\nmemory, to the Grecian Islands and the Levant. Those were golden days\nand balmy nights! In and out of harbour all the time--old friends\neverywhere--sleeping in some cool temple or ruined cistern during the\nheat of the day--feasting and song after sundown, under great stars\nset in a velvet sky! Thence we turned and coasted up the Adriatic, its\nshores swimming in an atmosphere of amber, rose, and aquamarine; we\nlay in wide land-locked harbours, we roamed through ancient and noble\ncities, until at last one morning, as the sun rose royally behind us, we\nrode into Venice down a path of gold. O, Venice is a fine city, wherein\na rat can wander at his ease and take his pleasure! Or, when weary of\nwandering, can sit at the edge of the Grand Canal at night, feasting\nwith his friends, when the air is full of music and the sky full of\nstars, and the lights flash and shimmer on the polished steel prows of\nthe swaying gondolas, packed so that you could walk across the canal on\nthem from side to side! And then the food--do you like shellfish? Well,\nwell, we won’t linger over that now.’\n\nHe was silent for a time; and the Water Rat, silent too and enthralled,\nfloated on dream-canals and heard a phantom song pealing high between\nvaporous grey wave-lapped walls.\n\n‘Southwards we sailed again at last,’ continued the Sea Rat, ‘coasting\ndown the Italian shore, till finally we made Palermo, and there I\nquitted for a long, happy spell on shore. I never stick too long to one\nship; one gets narrow-minded and prejudiced. Besides, Sicily is one of\nmy happy hunting-grounds. I know everybody there, and their ways just\nsuit me. I spent many jolly weeks in the island, staying with friends up\ncountry. When I grew restless again I took advantage of a ship that was\ntrading to Sardinia and Corsica; and very glad I was to feel the fresh\nbreeze and the sea-spray in my face once more.’\n\n‘But isn’t it very hot and stuffy, down in the--hold, I think you call\nit?’ asked the Water Rat.\n\nThe seafarer looked at him with the suspicion of a wink. ‘I’m an old\nhand,’ he remarked with much simplicity. ‘The captain’s cabin’s good\nenough for me.’\n\n‘It’s a hard life, by all accounts,’ murmured the Rat, sunk in deep\nthought.\n\n‘For the crew it is,’ replied the seafarer gravely, again with the ghost\nof a wink.\n\n‘From Corsica,’ he went on, ‘I made use of a ship that was taking wine\nto the mainland. We made Alassio in the evening, lay to, hauled up our\nwine-casks, and hove them overboard, tied one to the other by a long\nline. Then the crew took to the boats and rowed shorewards, singing as\nthey went, and drawing after them the long bobbing procession of casks,\nlike a mile of porpoises. On the sands they had horses waiting, which\ndragged the casks up the steep street of the little town with a fine\nrush and clatter and scramble. When the last cask was in, we went and\nrefreshed and rested, and sat late into the night, drinking with our\nfriends, and next morning I took to the great olive-woods for a spell\nand a rest. For now I had done with islands for the time, and ports and\nshipping were plentiful; so I led a lazy life among the peasants, lying\nand watching them work, or stretched high on the hillside with the blue\nMediterranean far below me. And so at length, by easy stages, and partly\non foot, partly by sea, to Marseilles, and the meeting of old shipmates,\nand the visiting of great ocean-bound vessels, and feasting once\nmore. Talk of shell-fish! Why, sometimes I dream of the shell-fish of\nMarseilles, and wake up crying!’\n\n‘That reminds me,’ said the polite Water Rat; ‘you happened to mention\nthat you were hungry, and I ought to have spoken earlier. Of course, you\nwill stop and take your midday meal with me? My hole is close by; it is\nsome time past noon, and you are very welcome to whatever there is.’\n\n‘Now I call that kind and brotherly of you,’ said the Sea Rat. ‘I was\nindeed hungry when I sat down, and ever since I inadvertently happened\nto mention shell-fish, my pangs have been extreme. But couldn’t you\nfetch it along out here? I am none too fond of going under hatches,\nunless I’m obliged to; and then, while we eat, I could tell you more\nconcerning my voyages and the pleasant life I lead--at least, it is very\npleasant to me, and by your attention I judge it commends itself to you;\nwhereas if we go indoors it is a hundred to one that I shall presently\nfall asleep.’\n\n‘That is indeed an excellent suggestion,’ said the Water Rat, and\nhurried off home. There he got out the luncheon-basket and packed\na simple meal, in which, remembering the stranger’s origin and\npreferences, he took care to include a yard of long French bread, a\nsausage out of which the garlic sang, some cheese which lay down\nand cried, and a long-necked straw-covered flask wherein lay bottled\nsunshine shed and garnered on far Southern slopes. Thus laden, he\nreturned with all speed, and blushed for pleasure at the old seaman’s\ncommendations of his taste and judgment, as together they unpacked the\nbasket and laid out the contents on the grass by the roadside.\n\nThe Sea Rat, as soon as his hunger was somewhat assuaged, continued the\nhistory of his latest voyage, conducting his simple hearer from port to\nport of Spain, landing him at Lisbon, Oporto, and Bordeaux, introducing\nhim to the pleasant harbours of Cornwall and Devon, and so up the\nChannel to that final quayside, where, landing after winds long\ncontrary, storm-driven and weather-beaten, he had caught the first\nmagical hints and heraldings of another Spring, and, fired by these, had\nsped on a long tramp inland, hungry for the experiment of life on some\nquiet farmstead, very far from the weary beating of any sea.\n\nSpell-bound and quivering with excitement, the Water Rat followed\nthe Adventurer league by league, over stormy bays, through crowded\nroadsteads, across harbour bars on a racing tide, up winding rivers that\nhid their busy little towns round a sudden turn; and left him with a\nregretful sigh planted at his dull inland farm, about which he desired\nto hear nothing.\n\nBy this time their meal was over, and the Seafarer, refreshed and\nstrengthened, his voice more vibrant, his eye lit with a brightness that\nseemed caught from some far-away sea-beacon, filled his glass with the\nred and glowing vintage of the South, and, leaning towards the Water\nRat, compelled his gaze and held him, body and soul, while he talked.\nThose eyes were of the changing foam-streaked grey-green of leaping\nNorthern seas; in the glass shone a hot ruby that seemed the very\nheart of the South, beating for him who had courage to respond to its\npulsation. The twin lights, the shifting grey and the steadfast red,\nmastered the Water Rat and held him bound, fascinated, powerless. The\nquiet world outside their rays receded far away and ceased to be. And\nthe talk, the wonderful talk flowed on--or was it speech entirely,\nor did it pass at times into song--chanty of the sailors weighing the\ndripping anchor, sonorous hum of the shrouds in a tearing North-Easter,\nballad of the fisherman hauling his nets at sundown against an apricot\nsky, chords of guitar and mandoline from gondola or caique? Did it\nchange into the cry of the wind, plaintive at first, angrily shrill as\nit freshened, rising to a tearing whistle, sinking to a musical trickle\nof air from the leech of the bellying sail? All these sounds the\nspell-bound listener seemed to hear, and with them the hungry complaint\nof the gulls and the sea-mews, the soft thunder of the breaking wave,\nthe cry of the protesting shingle. Back into speech again it passed, and\nwith beating heart he was following the adventures of a dozen seaports,\nthe fights, the escapes, the rallies, the comradeships, the gallant\nundertakings; or he searched islands for treasure, fished in still\nlagoons and dozed day-long on warm white sand. Of deep-sea fishings he\nheard tell, and mighty silver gatherings of the mile-long net; of sudden\nperils, noise of breakers on a moonless night, or the tall bows of\nthe great liner taking shape overhead through the fog; of the merry\nhome-coming, the headland rounded, the harbour lights opened out;\nthe groups seen dimly on the quay, the cheery hail, the splash of the\nhawser; the trudge up the steep little street towards the comforting\nglow of red-curtained windows.\n\nLastly, in his waking dream it seemed to him that the Adventurer had\nrisen to his feet, but was still speaking, still holding him fast with\nhis sea-grey eyes.\n\n‘And now,’ he was softly saying, ‘I take to the road again, holding on\nsouthwestwards for many a long and dusty day; till at last I reach the\nlittle grey sea town I know so well, that clings along one steep side of\nthe harbour. There through dark doorways you look down flights of stone\nsteps, overhung by great pink tufts of valerian and ending in a patch\nof sparkling blue water. The little boats that lie tethered to the\nrings and stanchions of the old sea-wall are gaily painted as those\nI clambered in and out of in my own childhood; the salmon leap on the\nflood tide, schools of mackerel flash and play past quay-sides and\nforeshores, and by the windows the great vessels glide, night and day,\nup to their moorings or forth to the open sea. There, sooner or later,\nthe ships of all seafaring nations arrive; and there, at its destined\nhour, the ship of my choice will let go its anchor. I shall take my\ntime, I shall tarry and bide, till at last the right one lies waiting\nfor me, warped out into midstream, loaded low, her bowsprit pointing\ndown harbour. I shall slip on board, by boat or along hawser; and then\none morning I shall wake to the song and tramp of the sailors, the clink\nof the capstan, and the rattle of the anchor-chain coming merrily in.\nWe shall break out the jib and the foresail, the white houses on the\nharbour side will glide slowly past us as she gathers steering-way, and\nthe voyage will have begun! As she forges towards the headland she will\nclothe herself with canvas; and then, once outside, the sounding slap of\ngreat green seas as she heels to the wind, pointing South!\n\n‘And you, you will come too, young brother; for the days pass, and never\nreturn, and the South still waits for you. Take the Adventure, heed the\ncall, now ere the irrevocable moment passes!’ ‘Tis but a banging of the\ndoor behind you, a blithesome step forward, and you are out of the old\nlife and into the new! Then some day, some day long hence, jog home here\nif you will, when the cup has been drained and the play has been played,\nand sit down by your quiet river with a store of goodly memories for\ncompany. You can easily overtake me on the road, for you are young, and\nI am ageing and go softly. I will linger, and look back; and at last I\nwill surely see you coming, eager and light-hearted, with all the South\nin your face!’\n\nThe voice died away and ceased as an insect’s tiny trumpet dwindles\nswiftly into silence; and the Water Rat, paralysed and staring, saw at\nlast but a distant speck on the white surface of the road.\n\nMechanically he rose and proceeded to repack the luncheon-basket,\ncarefully and without haste. Mechanically he returned home, gathered\ntogether a few small necessaries and special treasures he was fond of,\nand put them in a satchel; acting with slow deliberation, moving about\nthe room like a sleep-walker; listening ever with parted lips. He swung\nthe satchel over his shoulder, carefully selected a stout stick for his\nwayfaring, and with no haste, but with no hesitation at all, he stepped\nacross the threshold just as the Mole appeared at the door.\n\n‘Why, where are you off to, Ratty?’ asked the Mole in great surprise,\ngrasping him by the arm.\n\n‘Going South, with the rest of them,’ murmured the Rat in a dreamy\nmonotone, never looking at him. ‘Seawards first and then on shipboard,\nand so to the shores that are calling me!’\n\nHe pressed resolutely forward, still without haste, but with dogged\nfixity of purpose; but the Mole, now thoroughly alarmed, placed himself\nin front of him, and looking into his eyes saw that they were glazed and\nset and turned a streaked and shifting grey--not his friend’s eyes, but\nthe eyes of some other animal! Grappling with him strongly he dragged\nhim inside, threw him down, and held him.\n\nThe Rat struggled desperately for a few moments, and then his strength\nseemed suddenly to leave him, and he lay still and exhausted, with\nclosed eyes, trembling. Presently the Mole assisted him to rise and\nplaced him in a chair, where he sat collapsed and shrunken into\nhimself, his body shaken by a violent shivering, passing in time into\nan hysterical fit of dry sobbing. Mole made the door fast, threw the\nsatchel into a drawer and locked it, and sat down quietly on the table\nby his friend, waiting for the strange seizure to pass. Gradually the\nRat sank into a troubled doze, broken by starts and confused murmurings\nof things strange and wild and foreign to the unenlightened Mole; and\nfrom that he passed into a deep slumber.\n\nVery anxious in mind, the Mole left him for a time and busied himself\nwith household matters; and it was getting dark when he returned to the\nparlour and found the Rat where he had left him, wide awake indeed, but\nlistless, silent, and dejected. He took one hasty glance at his eyes;\nfound them, to his great gratification, clear and dark and brown again\nas before; and then sat down and tried to cheer him up and help him to\nrelate what had happened to him.\n\nPoor Ratty did his best, by degrees, to explain things; but how could\nhe put into cold words what had mostly been suggestion? How recall, for\nanother’s benefit, the haunting sea voices that had sung to him,\nhow reproduce at second-hand the magic of the Seafarer’s hundred\nreminiscences? Even to himself, now the spell was broken and the glamour\ngone, he found it difficult to account for what had seemed, some hours\nago, the inevitable and only thing. It is not surprising, then, that he\nfailed to convey to the Mole any clear idea of what he had been through\nthat day.\n\nTo the Mole this much was plain: the fit, or attack, had passed\naway, and had left him sane again, though shaken and cast down by the\nreaction. But he seemed to have lost all interest for the time in the\nthings that went to make up his daily life, as well as in all pleasant\nforecastings of the altered days and doings that the changing season was\nsurely bringing.\n\nCasually, then, and with seeming indifference, the Mole turned his talk\nto the harvest that was being gathered in, the towering wagons and their\nstraining teams, the growing ricks, and the large moon rising over bare\nacres dotted with sheaves. He talked of the reddening apples around, of\nthe browning nuts, of jams and preserves and the distilling of cordials;\ntill by easy stages such as these he reached midwinter, its hearty joys\nand its snug home life, and then he became simply lyrical.\n\nBy degrees the Rat began to sit up and to join in. His dull eye\nbrightened, and he lost some of his listening air.\n\nPresently the tactful Mole slipped away and returned with a pencil and\na few half-sheets of paper, which he placed on the table at his friend’s\nelbow.\n\n‘It’s quite a long time since you did any poetry,’ he remarked. ‘You\nmight have a try at it this evening, instead of--well, brooding over\nthings so much. I’ve an idea that you’ll feel a lot better when you’ve\ngot something jotted down--if it’s only just the rhymes.’\n\nThe Rat pushed the paper away from him wearily, but the discreet Mole\ntook occasion to leave the room, and when he peeped in again some\ntime later, the Rat was absorbed and deaf to the world; alternately\nscribbling and sucking the top of his pencil. It is true that he sucked\na good deal more than he scribbled; but it was joy to the Mole to know\nthat the cure had at least begun.\n\n\n\n\nX. THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF TOAD\n\nThe front door of the hollow tree faced eastwards, so Toad was called at\nan early hour; partly by the bright sunlight streaming in on him, partly\nby the exceeding coldness of his toes, which made him dream that he was\nat home in bed in his own handsome room with the Tudor window, on a cold\nwinter’s night, and his bedclothes had got up, grumbling and protesting\nthey couldn’t stand the cold any longer, and had run downstairs to the\nkitchen fire to warm themselves; and he had followed, on bare feet,\nalong miles and miles of icy stone-paved passages, arguing and\nbeseeching them to be reasonable. He would probably have been aroused\nmuch earlier, had he not slept for some weeks on straw over stone flags,\nand almost forgotten the friendly feeling of thick blankets pulled well\nup round the chin.\n\nSitting up, he rubbed his eyes first and his complaining toes next,\nwondered for a moment where he was, looking round for familiar\nstone wall and little barred window; then, with a leap of the heart,\nremembered everything--his escape, his flight, his pursuit; remembered,\nfirst and best thing of all, that he was free!\n\nFree! The word and the thought alone were worth fifty blankets. He was\nwarm from end to end as he thought of the jolly world outside, waiting\neagerly for him to make his triumphal entrance, ready to serve him\nand play up to him, anxious to help him and to keep him company, as it\nalways had been in days of old before misfortune fell upon him. He shook\nhimself and combed the dry leaves out of his hair with his fingers; and,\nhis toilet complete, marched forth into the comfortable morning sun,\ncold but confident, hungry but hopeful, all nervous terrors of yesterday\ndispelled by rest and sleep and frank and heartening sunshine.\n\nHe had the world all to himself, that early summer morning. The dewy\nwoodland, as he threaded it, was solitary and still: the green fields\nthat succeeded the trees were his own to do as he liked with; the road\nitself, when he reached it, in that loneliness that was everywhere,\nseemed, like a stray dog, to be looking anxiously for company. Toad,\nhowever, was looking for something that could talk, and tell him clearly\nwhich way he ought to go. It is all very well, when you have a light\nheart, and a clear conscience, and money in your pocket, and nobody\nscouring the country for you to drag you off to prison again, to follow\nwhere the road beckons and points, not caring whither. The practical\nToad cared very much indeed, and he could have kicked the road for its\nhelpless silence when every minute was of importance to him.\n\nThe reserved rustic road was presently joined by a shy little brother in\nthe shape of a canal, which took its hand and ambled along by its side\nin perfect confidence, but with the same tongue-tied, uncommunicative\nattitude towards strangers. ‘Bother them!’ said Toad to himself. ‘But,\nanyhow, one thing’s clear. They must both be coming FROM somewhere,\nand going TO somewhere. You can’t get over that. Toad, my boy!’ So he\nmarched on patiently by the water’s edge.\n\nRound a bend in the canal came plodding a solitary horse, stooping\nforward as if in anxious thought. From rope traces attached to his\ncollar stretched a long line, taut, but dipping with his stride, the\nfurther part of it dripping pearly drops. Toad let the horse pass, and\nstood waiting for what the fates were sending him.\n\nWith a pleasant swirl of quiet water at its blunt bow the barge slid up\nalongside of him, its gaily painted gunwale level with the towing-path,\nits sole occupant a big stout woman wearing a linen sun-bonnet, one\nbrawny arm laid along the tiller.\n\n‘A nice morning, ma’am!’ she remarked to Toad, as she drew up level with\nhim.\n\n‘I dare say it is, ma’am!’ responded Toad politely, as he walked along\nthe tow-path abreast of her. ‘I dare it IS a nice morning to them that’s\nnot in sore trouble, like what I am. Here’s my married daughter, she\nsends off to me post-haste to come to her at once; so off I comes, not\nknowing what may be happening or going to happen, but fearing the worst,\nas you will understand, ma’am, if you’re a mother, too. And I’ve left my\nbusiness to look after itself--I’m in the washing and laundering line,\nyou must know, ma’am--and I’ve left my young children to look after\nthemselves, and a more mischievous and troublesome set of young imps\ndoesn’t exist, ma’am; and I’ve lost all my money, and lost my way, and\nas for what may be happening to my married daughter, why, I don’t like\nto think of it, ma’am!’\n\n‘Where might your married daughter be living, ma’am?’ asked the\nbarge-woman.\n\n‘She lives near to the river, ma’am,’ replied Toad. ‘Close to a fine\nhouse called Toad Hall, that’s somewheres hereabouts in these parts.\nPerhaps you may have heard of it.’\n\n‘Toad Hall? Why, I’m going that way myself,’ replied the barge-woman.\n‘This canal joins the river some miles further on, a little above Toad\nHall; and then it’s an easy walk. You come along in the barge with me,\nand I’ll give you a lift.’\n\nShe steered the barge close to the bank, and Toad, with many humble and\ngrateful acknowledgments, stepped lightly on board and sat down with\ngreat satisfaction. ‘Toad’s luck again!’ thought he. ‘I always come out\non top!’\n\n‘So you’re in the washing business, ma’am?’ said the barge-woman\npolitely, as they glided along. ‘And a very good business you’ve got\ntoo, I dare say, if I’m not making too free in saying so.’\n\n‘Finest business in the whole country,’ said Toad airily. ‘All the\ngentry come to me--wouldn’t go to any one else if they were paid, they\nknow me so well. You see, I understand my work thoroughly, and attend to\nit all myself. Washing, ironing, clear-starching, making up gents’ fine\nshirts for evening wear--everything’s done under my own eye!’\n\n‘But surely you don’t DO all that work yourself, ma’am?’ asked the\nbarge-woman respectfully.\n\n‘O, I have girls,’ said Toad lightly: ‘twenty girls or thereabouts,\nalways at work. But you know what GIRLS are, ma’am! Nasty little\nhussies, that’s what _I_ call ‘em!’\n\n‘So do I, too,’ said the barge-woman with great heartiness. ‘But I dare\nsay you set yours to rights, the idle trollops! And are you very fond of\nwashing?’\n\n‘I love it,’ said Toad. ‘I simply dote on it. Never so happy as when\nI’ve got both arms in the wash-tub. But, then, it comes so easy to me!\nNo trouble at all! A real pleasure, I assure you, ma’am!’\n\n‘What a bit of luck, meeting you!’ observed the barge-woman,\nthoughtfully. ‘A regular piece of good fortune for both of us!’\n\n‘Why, what do you mean?’ asked Toad, nervously.\n\n‘Well, look at me, now,’ replied the barge-woman. ‘_I_ like washing,\ntoo, just the same as you do; and for that matter, whether I like it or\nnot I have got to do all my own, naturally, moving about as I do. Now my\nhusband, he’s such a fellow for shirking his work and leaving the barge\nto me, that never a moment do I get for seeing to my own affairs. By\nrights he ought to be here now, either steering or attending to the\nhorse, though luckily the horse has sense enough to attend to himself.\nInstead of which, he’s gone off with the dog, to see if they can’t pick\nup a rabbit for dinner somewhere. Says he’ll catch me up at the next\nlock. Well, that’s as may be--I don’t trust him, once he gets off with\nthat dog, who’s worse than he is. But meantime, how am I to get on with\nmy washing?’\n\n‘O, never mind about the washing,’ said Toad, not liking the subject.\n‘Try and fix your mind on that rabbit. A nice fat young rabbit, I’ll be\nbound. Got any onions?’\n\n‘I can’t fix my mind on anything but my washing,’ said the barge-woman,\n‘and I wonder you can be talking of rabbits, with such a joyful prospect\nbefore you. There’s a heap of things of mine that you’ll find in\na corner of the cabin. If you’ll just take one or two of the most\nnecessary sort--I won’t venture to describe them to a lady like you, but\nyou’ll recognise them at a glance--and put them through the wash-tub as\nwe go along, why, it’ll be a pleasure to you, as you rightly say, and a\nreal help to me. You’ll find a tub handy, and soap, and a kettle on the\nstove, and a bucket to haul up water from the canal with. Then I shall\nknow you’re enjoying yourself, instead of sitting here idle, looking at\nthe scenery and yawning your head off.’\n\n‘Here, you let me steer!’ said Toad, now thoroughly frightened, ‘and\nthen you can get on with your washing your own way. I might spoil your\nthings, or not do ‘em as you like. I’m more used to gentlemen’s things\nmyself. It’s my special line.’\n\n‘Let you steer?’ replied the barge-woman, laughing. ‘It takes some\npractice to steer a barge properly. Besides, it’s dull work, and I want\nyou to be happy. No, you shall do the washing you are so fond of, and\nI’ll stick to the steering that I understand. Don’t try and deprive me\nof the pleasure of giving you a treat!’\n\nToad was fairly cornered. He looked for escape this way and that,\nsaw that he was too far from the bank for a flying leap, and sullenly\nresigned himself to his fate. ‘If it comes to that,’ he thought in\ndesperation, ‘I suppose any fool can WASH!’\n\nHe fetched tub, soap, and other necessaries from the cabin, selected a\nfew garments at random, tried to recollect what he had seen in casual\nglances through laundry windows, and set to.\n\nA long half-hour passed, and every minute of it saw Toad getting crosser\nand crosser. Nothing that he could do to the things seemed to please\nthem or do them good. He tried coaxing, he tried slapping, he tried\npunching; they smiled back at him out of the tub unconverted, happy in\ntheir original sin. Once or twice he looked nervously over his shoulder\nat the barge-woman, but she appeared to be gazing out in front of her,\nabsorbed in her steering. His back ached badly, and he noticed with\ndismay that his paws were beginning to get all crinkly. Now Toad was\nvery proud of his paws. He muttered under his breath words that should\nnever pass the lips of either washerwomen or Toads; and lost the soap,\nfor the fiftieth time.\n\nA burst of laughter made him straighten himself and look round. The\nbarge-woman was leaning back and laughing unrestrainedly, till the tears\nran down her cheeks.\n\n‘I’ve been watching you all the time,’ she gasped. ‘I thought you\nmust be a humbug all along, from the conceited way you talked. Pretty\nwasherwoman you are! Never washed so much as a dish-clout in your life,\nI’ll lay!’\n\nToad’s temper which had been simmering viciously for some time, now\nfairly boiled over, and he lost all control of himself.\n\n‘You common, low, FAT barge-woman!’ he shouted; ‘don’t you dare to talk\nto your betters like that! Washerwoman indeed! I would have you to know\nthat I am a Toad, a very well-known, respected, distinguished Toad! I\nmay be under a bit of a cloud at present, but I will NOT be laughed at\nby a bargewoman!’\n\nThe woman moved nearer to him and peered under his bonnet keenly and\nclosely. ‘Why, so you are!’ she cried. ‘Well, I never! A horrid, nasty,\ncrawly Toad! And in my nice clean barge, too! Now that is a thing that I\nwill NOT have.’\n\nShe relinquished the tiller for a moment. One big mottled arm shot out\nand caught Toad by a fore-leg, while the other-gripped him fast by a\nhind-leg. Then the world turned suddenly upside down, the barge seemed\nto flit lightly across the sky, the wind whistled in his ears, and Toad\nfound himself flying through the air, revolving rapidly as he went.\n\nThe water, when he eventually reached it with a loud splash, proved\nquite cold enough for his taste, though its chill was not sufficient to\nquell his proud spirit, or slake the heat of his furious temper. He rose\nto the surface spluttering, and when he had wiped the duck-weed out of\nhis eyes the first thing he saw was the fat barge-woman looking back at\nhim over the stern of the retreating barge and laughing; and he vowed,\nas he coughed and choked, to be even with her.\n\nHe struck out for the shore, but the cotton gown greatly impeded his\nefforts, and when at length he touched land he found it hard to climb\nup the steep bank unassisted. He had to take a minute or two’s rest to\nrecover his breath; then, gathering his wet skirts well over his arms,\nhe started to run after the barge as fast as his legs would carry him,\nwild with indignation, thirsting for revenge.\n\nThe barge-woman was still laughing when he drew up level with her. ‘Put\nyourself through your mangle, washerwoman,’ she called out, ‘and iron\nyour face and crimp it, and you’ll pass for quite a decent-looking\nToad!’\n\nToad never paused to reply. Solid revenge was what he wanted, not cheap,\nwindy, verbal triumphs, though he had a thing or two in his mind that\nhe would have liked to say. He saw what he wanted ahead of him. Running\nswiftly on he overtook the horse, unfastened the towrope and cast off,\njumped lightly on the horse’s back, and urged it to a gallop by kicking\nit vigorously in the sides. He steered for the open country, abandoning\nthe tow-path, and swinging his steed down a rutty lane. Once he looked\nback, and saw that the barge had run aground on the other side of the\ncanal, and the barge-woman was gesticulating wildly and shouting, ‘Stop,\nstop, stop!’ ‘I’ve heard that song before,’ said Toad, laughing, as he\ncontinued to spur his steed onward in its wild career.\n\nThe barge-horse was not capable of any very sustained effort, and its\ngallop soon subsided into a trot, and its trot into an easy walk; but\nToad was quite contented with this, knowing that he, at any rate, was\nmoving, and the barge was not. He had quite recovered his temper,\nnow that he had done something he thought really clever; and he was\nsatisfied to jog along quietly in the sun, steering his horse along\nby-ways and bridle-paths, and trying to forget how very long it was\nsince he had had a square meal, till the canal had been left very far\nbehind him.\n\nHe had travelled some miles, his horse and he, and he was feeling drowsy\nin the hot sunshine, when the horse stopped, lowered his head, and\nbegan to nibble the grass; and Toad, waking up, just saved himself from\nfalling off by an effort. He looked about him and found he was on a wide\ncommon, dotted with patches of gorse and bramble as far as he could see.\nNear him stood a dingy gipsy caravan, and beside it a man was sitting on\na bucket turned upside down, very busy smoking and staring into the wide\nworld. A fire of sticks was burning near by, and over the fire hung an\niron pot, and out of that pot came forth bubblings and gurglings, and\na vague suggestive steaminess. Also smells--warm, rich, and varied\nsmells--that twined and twisted and wreathed themselves at last into one\ncomplete, voluptuous, perfect smell that seemed like the very soul of\nNature taking form and appearing to her children, a true Goddess, a\nmother of solace and comfort. Toad now knew well that he had not been\nreally hungry before. What he had felt earlier in the day had been a\nmere trifling qualm. This was the real thing at last, and no mistake;\nand it would have to be dealt with speedily, too, or there would be\ntrouble for somebody or something. He looked the gipsy over carefully,\nwondering vaguely whether it would be easier to fight him or cajole him.\nSo there he sat, and sniffed and sniffed, and looked at the gipsy; and\nthe gipsy sat and smoked, and looked at him.\n\nPresently the gipsy took his pipe out of his mouth and remarked in a\ncareless way, ‘Want to sell that there horse of yours?’\n\nToad was completely taken aback. He did not know that gipsies were very\nfond of horse-dealing, and never missed an opportunity, and he had\nnot reflected that caravans were always on the move and took a deal of\ndrawing. It had not occurred to him to turn the horse into cash, but the\ngipsy’s suggestion seemed to smooth the way towards the two things he\nwanted so badly--ready money, and a solid breakfast.\n\n‘What?’ he said, ‘me sell this beautiful young horse of mine? O, no;\nit’s out of the question. Who’s going to take the washing home to my\ncustomers every week? Besides, I’m too fond of him, and he simply dotes\non me.’\n\n‘Try and love a donkey,’ suggested the gipsy. ‘Some people do.’\n\n‘You don’t seem to see,’ continued Toad, ‘that this fine horse of mine\nis a cut above you altogether. He’s a blood horse, he is, partly;\nnot the part you see, of course--another part. And he’s been a Prize\nHackney, too, in his time--that was the time before you knew him, but\nyou can still tell it on him at a glance, if you understand anything\nabout horses. No, it’s not to be thought of for a moment. All the same,\nhow much might you be disposed to offer me for this beautiful young\nhorse of mine?’\n\nThe gipsy looked the horse over, and then he looked Toad over with equal\ncare, and looked at the horse again. ‘Shillin’ a leg,’ he said briefly,\nand turned away, continuing to smoke and try to stare the wide world out\nof countenance.\n\n‘A shilling a leg?’ cried Toad. ‘If you please, I must take a little\ntime to work that out, and see just what it comes to.’\n\nHe climbed down off his horse, and left it to graze, and sat down by the\ngipsy, and did sums on his fingers, and at last he said, ‘A shilling a\nleg? Why, that comes to exactly four shillings, and no more. O, no; I\ncould not think of accepting four shillings for this beautiful young\nhorse of mine.’\n\n‘Well,’ said the gipsy, ‘I’ll tell you what I will do. I’ll make it five\nshillings, and that’s three-and-sixpence more than the animal’s worth.\nAnd that’s my last word.’\n\nThen Toad sat and pondered long and deeply. For he was hungry and quite\npenniless, and still some way--he knew not how far--from home, and\nenemies might still be looking for him. To one in such a situation, five\nshillings may very well appear a large sum of money. On the other hand,\nit did not seem very much to get for a horse. But then, again, the horse\nhadn’t cost him anything; so whatever he got was all clear profit. At\nlast he said firmly, ‘Look here, gipsy! I tell you what we will do; and\nthis is MY last word. You shall hand me over six shillings and sixpence,\ncash down; and further, in addition thereto, you shall give me as much\nbreakfast as I can possibly eat, at one sitting of course, out of that\niron pot of yours that keeps sending forth such delicious and exciting\nsmells. In return, I will make over to you my spirited young horse, with\nall the beautiful harness and trappings that are on him, freely thrown\nin. If that’s not good enough for you, say so, and I’ll be getting on. I\nknow a man near here who’s wanted this horse of mine for years.’\n\nThe gipsy grumbled frightfully, and declared if he did a few more deals\nof that sort he’d be ruined. But in the end he lugged a dirty canvas bag\nout of the depths of his trouser pocket, and counted out six shillings\nand sixpence into Toad’s paw. Then he disappeared into the caravan for\nan instant, and returned with a large iron plate and a knife, fork,\nand spoon. He tilted up the pot, and a glorious stream of hot rich stew\ngurgled into the plate. It was, indeed, the most beautiful stew in the\nworld, being made of partridges, and pheasants, and chickens, and\nhares, and rabbits, and pea-hens, and guinea-fowls, and one or two other\nthings. Toad took the plate on his lap, almost crying, and stuffed,\nand stuffed, and stuffed, and kept asking for more, and the gipsy never\ngrudged it him. He thought that he had never eaten so good a breakfast\nin all his life.\n\nWhen Toad had taken as much stew on board as he thought he could\npossibly hold, he got up and said good-bye to the gipsy, and took\nan affectionate farewell of the horse; and the gipsy, who knew the\nriverside well, gave him directions which way to go, and he set forth on\nhis travels again in the best possible spirits. He was, indeed, a very\ndifferent Toad from the animal of an hour ago. The sun was shining\nbrightly, his wet clothes were quite dry again, he had money in his\npocket once more, he was nearing home and friends and safety, and, most\nand best of all, he had had a substantial meal, hot and nourishing, and\nfelt big, and strong, and careless, and self-confident.\n\nAs he tramped along gaily, he thought of his adventures and escapes, and\nhow when things seemed at their worst he had always managed to find a\nway out; and his pride and conceit began to swell within him. ‘Ho, ho!’\nhe said to himself as he marched along with his chin in the air, ‘what\na clever Toad I am! There is surely no animal equal to me for cleverness\nin the whole world! My enemies shut me up in prison, encircled by\nsentries, watched night and day by warders; I walk out through them all,\nby sheer ability coupled with courage. They pursue me with engines,\nand policemen, and revolvers; I snap my fingers at them, and vanish,\nlaughing, into space. I am, unfortunately, thrown into a canal by a\nwoman fat of body and very evil-minded. What of it? I swim ashore, I\nseize her horse, I ride off in triumph, and I sell the horse for a whole\npocketful of money and an excellent breakfast! Ho, ho! I am The Toad,\nthe handsome, the popular, the successful Toad!’ He got so puffed up\nwith conceit that he made up a song as he walked in praise of himself,\nand sang it at the top of his voice, though there was no one to hear\nit but him. It was perhaps the most conceited song that any animal ever\ncomposed.\n\n\n          ‘The world has held great Heroes,\n            As history-books have showed;\n          But never a name to go down to fame\n            Compared with that of Toad!\n\n          ‘The clever men at Oxford\n            Know all that there is to be knowed.\n          But they none of them know one half as much\n            As intelligent Mr. Toad!\n\n          ‘The animals sat in the Ark and cried,\n            Their tears in torrents flowed.\n          Who was it said, “There’s land ahead?”\n             Encouraging Mr. Toad!\n\n          ‘The army all saluted\n            As they marched along the road.\n          Was it the King? Or Kitchener?\n            No. It was Mr. Toad.\n\n          ‘The Queen and her Ladies-in-waiting\n            Sat at the window and sewed.\n          She cried, “Look! who’s that _handsome_ man?”\n             They answered, “Mr. Toad.”’\n\n\nThere was a great deal more of the same sort, but too dreadfully\nconceited to be written down. These are some of the milder verses.\n\nHe sang as he walked, and he walked as he sang, and got more inflated\nevery minute. But his pride was shortly to have a severe fall.\n\nAfter some miles of country lanes he reached the high road, and as he\nturned into it and glanced along its white length, he saw approaching\nhim a speck that turned into a dot and then into a blob, and then into\nsomething very familiar; and a double note of warning, only too well\nknown, fell on his delighted ear.\n\n‘This is something like!’ said the excited Toad. ‘This is real life\nagain, this is once more the great world from which I have been missed\nso long! I will hail them, my brothers of the wheel, and pitch them a\nyarn, of the sort that has been so successful hitherto; and they will\ngive me a lift, of course, and then I will talk to them some more; and,\nperhaps, with luck, it may even end in my driving up to Toad Hall in a\nmotor-car! That will be one in the eye for Badger!’\n\nHe stepped confidently out into the road to hail the motor-car, which\ncame along at an easy pace, slowing down as it neared the lane; when\nsuddenly he became very pale, his heart turned to water, his knees shook\nand yielded under him, and he doubled up and collapsed with a sickening\npain in his interior. And well he might, the unhappy animal; for the\napproaching car was the very one he had stolen out of the yard of the\nRed Lion Hotel on that fatal day when all his troubles began! And\nthe people in it were the very same people he had sat and watched at\nluncheon in the coffee-room!\n\nHe sank down in a shabby, miserable heap in the road, murmuring to\nhimself in his despair, ‘It’s all up! It’s all over now! Chains and\npolicemen again! Prison again! Dry bread and water again! O, what a\nfool I have been! What did I want to go strutting about the country for,\nsinging conceited songs, and hailing people in broad day on the high\nroad, instead of hiding till nightfall and slipping home quietly by back\nways! O hapless Toad! O ill-fated animal!’\n\nThe terrible motor-car drew slowly nearer and nearer, till at last he\nheard it stop just short of him. Two gentlemen got out and walked round\nthe trembling heap of crumpled misery lying in the road, and one of them\nsaid, ‘O dear! this is very sad! Here is a poor old thing--a washerwoman\napparently--who has fainted in the road! Perhaps she is overcome by the\nheat, poor creature; or possibly she has not had any food to-day. Let\nus lift her into the car and take her to the nearest village, where\ndoubtless she has friends.’\n\nThey tenderly lifted Toad into the motor-car and propped him up with\nsoft cushions, and proceeded on their way.\n\nWhen Toad heard them talk in so kind and sympathetic a way, and\nknew that he was not recognised, his courage began to revive, and he\ncautiously opened first one eye and then the other.\n\n‘Look!’ said one of the gentlemen, ‘she is better already. The fresh air\nis doing her good. How do you feel now, ma’am?’\n\n‘Thank you kindly, Sir,’ said Toad in a feeble voice, ‘I’m feeling a\ngreat deal better!’ ‘That’s right,’ said the gentleman. ‘Now keep quite\nstill, and, above all, don’t try to talk.’\n\n‘I won’t,’ said Toad. ‘I was only thinking, if I might sit on the front\nseat there, beside the driver, where I could get the fresh air full in\nmy face, I should soon be all right again.’\n\n‘What a very sensible woman!’ said the gentleman. ‘Of course you shall.’\nSo they carefully helped Toad into the front seat beside the driver, and\non they went again.\n\nToad was almost himself again by now. He sat up, looked about him, and\ntried to beat down the tremors, the yearnings, the old cravings that\nrose up and beset him and took possession of him entirely.\n\n‘It is fate!’ he said to himself. ‘Why strive? why struggle?’ and he\nturned to the driver at his side.\n\n‘Please, Sir,’ he said, ‘I wish you would kindly let me try and drive\nthe car for a little. I’ve been watching you carefully, and it looks so\neasy and so interesting, and I should like to be able to tell my friends\nthat once I had driven a motor-car!’\n\nThe driver laughed at the proposal, so heartily that the gentleman\ninquired what the matter was. When he heard, he said, to Toad’s delight,\n‘Bravo, ma’am! I like your spirit. Let her have a try, and look after\nher. She won’t do any harm.’\n\nToad eagerly scrambled into the seat vacated by the driver, took the\nsteering-wheel in his hands, listened with affected humility to the\ninstructions given him, and set the car in motion, but very slowly and\ncarefully at first, for he was determined to be prudent.\n\nThe gentlemen behind clapped their hands and applauded, and Toad heard\nthem saying, ‘How well she does it! Fancy a washerwoman driving a car as\nwell as that, the first time!’\n\nToad went a little faster; then faster still, and faster.\n\nHe heard the gentlemen call out warningly, ‘Be careful, washerwoman!’\nAnd this annoyed him, and he began to lose his head.\n\nThe driver tried to interfere, but he pinned him down in his seat with\none elbow, and put on full speed. The rush of air in his face, the hum\nof the engines, and the light jump of the car beneath him intoxicated\nhis weak brain. ‘Washerwoman, indeed!’ he shouted recklessly. ‘Ho! ho!\nI am the Toad, the motor-car snatcher, the prison-breaker, the Toad who\nalways escapes! Sit still, and you shall know what driving really\nis, for you are in the hands of the famous, the skilful, the entirely\nfearless Toad!’\n\nWith a cry of horror the whole party rose and flung themselves on him.\n‘Seize him!’ they cried, ‘seize the Toad, the wicked animal who\nstole our motor-car! Bind him, chain him, drag him to the nearest\npolice-station! Down with the desperate and dangerous Toad!’\n\nAlas! they should have thought, they ought to have been more prudent,\nthey should have remembered to stop the motor-car somehow before playing\nany pranks of that sort. With a half-turn of the wheel the Toad sent\nthe car crashing through the low hedge that ran along the roadside. One\nmighty bound, a violent shock, and the wheels of the car were churning\nup the thick mud of a horse-pond.\n\nToad found himself flying through the air with the strong upward rush\nand delicate curve of a swallow. He liked the motion, and was just\nbeginning to wonder whether it would go on until he developed wings and\nturned into a Toad-bird, when he landed on his back with a thump, in the\nsoft rich grass of a meadow. Sitting up, he could just see the motor-car\nin the pond, nearly submerged; the gentlemen and the driver, encumbered\nby their long coats, were floundering helplessly in the water.\n\nHe picked himself up rapidly, and set off running across country as hard\nas he could, scrambling through hedges, jumping ditches, pounding across\nfields, till he was breathless and weary, and had to settle down into\nan easy walk. When he had recovered his breath somewhat, and was able to\nthink calmly, he began to giggle, and from giggling he took to laughing,\nand he laughed till he had to sit down under a hedge. ‘Ho, ho!’ he\ncried, in ecstasies of self-admiration, ‘Toad again! Toad, as usual,\ncomes out on the top! Who was it got them to give him a lift? Who\nmanaged to get on the front seat for the sake of fresh air? Who\npersuaded them into letting him see if he could drive? Who landed them\nall in a horse-pond? Who escaped, flying gaily and unscathed through the\nair, leaving the narrow-minded, grudging, timid excursionists in the mud\nwhere they should rightly be? Why, Toad, of course; clever Toad, great\nToad, GOOD Toad!’\n\nThen he burst into song again, and chanted with uplifted voice--\n\n          ‘The motor-car went Poop-poop-poop,\n            As it raced along the road.\n          Who was it steered it into a pond?\n            Ingenious Mr. Toad!\n\nO, how clever I am! How clever, how clever, how very clev----’\n\nA slight noise at a distance behind him made him turn his head and look.\nO horror! O misery! O despair!\n\nAbout two fields off, a chauffeur in his leather gaiters and two large\nrural policemen were visible, running towards him as hard as they could\ngo!\n\nPoor Toad sprang to his feet and pelted away again, his heart in his\nmouth. O, my!’ he gasped, as he panted along, ‘what an ASS I am! What a\nCONCEITED and heedless ass! Swaggering again! Shouting and singing songs\nagain! Sitting still and gassing again! O my! O my! O my!’\n\nHe glanced back, and saw to his dismay that they were gaining on him.\nOn he ran desperately, but kept looking back, and saw that they still\ngained steadily. He did his best, but he was a fat animal, and his legs\nwere short, and still they gained. He could hear them close behind him\nnow. Ceasing to heed where he was going, he struggled on blindly and\nwildly, looking back over his shoulder at the now triumphant enemy, when\nsuddenly the earth failed under his feet, he grasped at the air, and,\nsplash! he found himself head over ears in deep water, rapid water,\nwater that bore him along with a force he could not contend with; and he\nknew that in his blind panic he had run straight into the river!\n\nHe rose to the surface and tried to grasp the reeds and the rushes that\ngrew along the water’s edge close under the bank, but the stream was so\nstrong that it tore them out of his hands. ‘O my!’ gasped poor Toad,\n‘if ever I steal a motor-car again! If ever I sing another conceited\nsong’--then down he went, and came up breathless and spluttering.\nPresently he saw that he was approaching a big dark hole in the bank,\njust above his head, and as the stream bore him past he reached up with\na paw and caught hold of the edge and held on. Then slowly and with\ndifficulty he drew himself up out of the water, till at last he was able\nto rest his elbows on the edge of the hole. There he remained for some\nminutes, puffing and panting, for he was quite exhausted.\n\nAs he sighed and blew and stared before him into the dark hole, some\nbright small thing shone and twinkled in its depths, moving towards\nhim. As it approached, a face grew up gradually around it, and it was a\nfamiliar face!\n\nBrown and small, with whiskers.\n\nGrave and round, with neat ears and silky hair.\n\nIt was the Water Rat!\n\n\n\n\nXI. ‘LIKE SUMMER TEMPESTS CAME HIS TEARS’\n\nThe Rat put out a neat little brown paw, gripped Toad firmly by\nthe scruff of the neck, and gave a great hoist and a pull; and the\nwater-logged Toad came up slowly but surely over the edge of the hole,\ntill at last he stood safe and sound in the hall, streaked with mud and\nweed to be sure, and with the water streaming off him, but happy and\nhigh-spirited as of old, now that he found himself once more in the\nhouse of a friend, and dodgings and evasions were over, and he could lay\naside a disguise that was unworthy of his position and wanted such a lot\nof living up to.\n\n‘O, Ratty!’ he cried. ‘I’ve been through such times since I saw you\nlast, you can’t think! Such trials, such sufferings, and all so nobly\nborne! Then such escapes, such disguises such subterfuges, and all so\ncleverly planned and carried out! Been in prison--got out of it, of\ncourse! Been thrown into a canal--swam ashore! Stole a horse--sold him\nfor a large sum of money! Humbugged everybody--made ‘em all do exactly\nwhat I wanted! Oh, I AM a smart Toad, and no mistake! What do you think\nmy last exploit was? Just hold on till I tell you----’\n\n‘Toad,’ said the Water Rat, gravely and firmly, ‘you go off upstairs\nat once, and take off that old cotton rag that looks as if it might\nformerly have belonged to some washerwoman, and clean yourself\nthoroughly, and put on some of my clothes, and try and come down\nlooking like a gentleman if you CAN; for a more shabby, bedraggled,\ndisreputable-looking object than you are I never set eyes on in my whole\nlife! Now, stop swaggering and arguing, and be off! I’ll have something\nto say to you later!’\n\nToad was at first inclined to stop and do some talking back at him. He\nhad had enough of being ordered about when he was in prison, and here\nwas the thing being begun all over again, apparently; and by a Rat,\ntoo! However, he caught sight of himself in the looking-glass over the\nhat-stand, with the rusty black bonnet perched rakishly over one eye,\nand he changed his mind and went very quickly and humbly upstairs to the\nRat’s dressing-room. There he had a thorough wash and brush-up, changed\nhis clothes, and stood for a long time before the glass, contemplating\nhimself with pride and pleasure, and thinking what utter idiots all the\npeople must have been to have ever mistaken him for one moment for a\nwasherwoman.\n\nBy the time he came down again luncheon was on the table, and very glad\nToad was to see it, for he had been through some trying experiences and\nhad taken much hard exercise since the excellent breakfast provided for\nhim by the gipsy. While they ate Toad told the Rat all his adventures,\ndwelling chiefly on his own cleverness, and presence of mind in\nemergencies, and cunning in tight places; and rather making out that he\nhad been having a gay and highly-coloured experience. But the more he\ntalked and boasted, the more grave and silent the Rat became.\n\nWhen at last Toad had talked himself to a standstill, there was silence\nfor a while; and then the Rat said, ‘Now, Toady, I don’t want to give\nyou pain, after all you’ve been through already; but, seriously, don’t\nyou see what an awful ass you’ve been making of yourself? On your\nown admission you have been handcuffed, imprisoned, starved, chased,\nterrified out of your life, insulted, jeered at, and ignominiously flung\ninto the water--by a woman, too! Where’s the amusement in that? Where\ndoes the fun come in? And all because you must needs go and steal a\nmotor-car. You know that you’ve never had anything but trouble from\nmotor-cars from the moment you first set eyes on one. But if you WILL\nbe mixed up with them--as you generally are, five minutes after you’ve\nstarted--why STEAL them? Be a cripple, if you think it’s exciting; be a\nbankrupt, for a change, if you’ve set your mind on it: but why choose\nto be a convict? When are you going to be sensible, and think of your\nfriends, and try and be a credit to them? Do you suppose it’s any\npleasure to me, for instance, to hear animals saying, as I go about,\nthat I’m the chap that keeps company with gaol-birds?’\n\nNow, it was a very comforting point in Toad’s character that he was a\nthoroughly good-hearted animal and never minded being jawed by those\nwho were his real friends. And even when most set upon a thing, he was\nalways able to see the other side of the question. So although, while\nthe Rat was talking so seriously, he kept saying to himself mutinously,\n‘But it WAS fun, though! Awful fun!’ and making strange suppressed\nnoises inside him, k-i-ck-ck-ck, and poop-p-p, and other sounds\nresembling stifled snorts, or the opening of soda-water bottles, yet\nwhen the Rat had quite finished, he heaved a deep sigh and said, very\nnicely and humbly, ‘Quite right, Ratty! How SOUND you always are! Yes,\nI’ve been a conceited old ass, I can quite see that; but now I’m going\nto be a good Toad, and not do it any more. As for motor-cars, I’ve not\nbeen at all so keen about them since my last ducking in that river of\nyours. The fact is, while I was hanging on to the edge of your hole\nand getting my breath, I had a sudden idea--a really brilliant\nidea--connected with motor-boats--there, there! don’t take on so, old\nchap, and stamp, and upset things; it was only an idea, and we won’t\ntalk any more about it now. We’ll have our coffee, AND a smoke, and a\nquiet chat, and then I’m going to stroll quietly down to Toad Hall, and\nget into clothes of my own, and set things going again on the old lines.\nI’ve had enough of adventures. I shall lead a quiet, steady, respectable\nlife, pottering about my property, and improving it, and doing a little\nlandscape gardening at times. There will always be a bit of dinner for\nmy friends when they come to see me; and I shall keep a pony-chaise to\njog about the country in, just as I used to in the good old days, before\nI got restless, and wanted to DO things.’\n\n‘Stroll quietly down to Toad Hall?’ cried the Rat, greatly excited.\n‘What are you talking about? Do you mean to say you haven’t HEARD?’\n\n‘Heard what?’ said Toad, turning rather pale. ‘Go on, Ratty! Quick!\nDon’t spare me! What haven’t I heard?’\n\n‘Do you mean to tell me,’ shouted the Rat, thumping with his little\nfist upon the table, ‘that you’ve heard nothing about the Stoats and\nWeasels?’\n\nWhat, the Wild Wooders?’ cried Toad, trembling in every limb. ‘No, not a\nword! What have they been doing?’\n\n‘--And how they’ve been and taken Toad Hall?’ continued the Rat.\n\nToad leaned his elbows on the table, and his chin on his paws; and a\nlarge tear welled up in each of his eyes, overflowed and splashed on the\ntable, plop! plop!\n\n‘Go on, Ratty,’ he murmured presently; ‘tell me all. The worst is over.\nI am an animal again. I can bear it.’\n\n‘When you--got--into that--that--trouble of yours,’ said the Rat, slowly\nand impressively; ‘I mean, when you--disappeared from society for a\ntime, over that misunderstanding about a--a machine, you know--’\n\nToad merely nodded.\n\n‘Well, it was a good deal talked about down here, naturally,’ continued\nthe Rat, ‘not only along the river-side, but even in the Wild Wood.\nAnimals took sides, as always happens. The River-bankers stuck up for\nyou, and said you had been infamously treated, and there was no justice\nto be had in the land nowadays. But the Wild Wood animals said hard\nthings, and served you right, and it was time this sort of thing was\nstopped. And they got very cocky, and went about saying you were done\nfor this time! You would never come back again, never, never!’\n\nToad nodded once more, keeping silence.\n\n‘That’s the sort of little beasts they are,’ the Rat went on. ‘But Mole\nand Badger, they stuck out, through thick and thin, that you would come\nback again soon, somehow. They didn’t know exactly how, but somehow!’\n\nToad began to sit up in his chair again, and to smirk a little.\n\n‘They argued from history,’ continued the Rat. ‘They said that\nno criminal laws had ever been known to prevail against cheek and\nplausibility such as yours, combined with the power of a long purse. So\nthey arranged to move their things in to Toad Hall, and sleep there, and\nkeep it aired, and have it all ready for you when you turned up. They\ndidn’t guess what was going to happen, of course; still, they had their\nsuspicions of the Wild Wood animals. Now I come to the most painful and\ntragic part of my story. One dark night--it was a VERY dark night, and\nblowing hard, too, and raining simply cats and dogs--a band of weasels,\narmed to the teeth, crept silently up the carriage-drive to the front\nentrance. Simultaneously, a body of desperate ferrets, advancing through\nthe kitchen-garden, possessed themselves of the backyard and offices;\nwhile a company of skirmishing stoats who stuck at nothing occupied the\nconservatory and the billiard-room, and held the French windows opening\non to the lawn.\n\n‘The Mole and the Badger were sitting by the fire in the smoking-room,\ntelling stories and suspecting nothing, for it wasn’t a night for any\nanimals to be out in, when those bloodthirsty villains broke down the\ndoors and rushed in upon them from every side. They made the best fight\nthey could, but what was the good? They were unarmed, and taken by\nsurprise, and what can two animals do against hundreds? They took and\nbeat them severely with sticks, those two poor faithful creatures,\nand turned them out into the cold and the wet, with many insulting and\nuncalled-for remarks!’\n\nHere the unfeeling Toad broke into a snigger, and then pulled himself\ntogether and tried to look particularly solemn.\n\n‘And the Wild Wooders have been living in Toad Hall ever since,’\ncontinued the Rat; ‘and going on simply anyhow! Lying in bed half the\nday, and breakfast at all hours, and the place in such a mess (I’m told)\nit’s not fit to be seen! Eating your grub, and drinking your drink, and\nmaking bad jokes about you, and singing vulgar songs, about--well, about\nprisons and magistrates, and policemen; horrid personal songs, with no\nhumour in them. And they’re telling the tradespeople and everybody that\nthey’ve come to stay for good.’\n\n‘O, have they!’ said Toad getting up and seizing a stick. ‘I’ll jolly\nsoon see about that!’\n\n‘It’s no good, Toad!’ called the Rat after him. ‘You’d better come back\nand sit down; you’ll only get into trouble.’\n\nBut the Toad was off, and there was no holding him. He marched rapidly\ndown the road, his stick over his shoulder, fuming and muttering to\nhimself in his anger, till he got near his front gate, when suddenly\nthere popped up from behind the palings a long yellow ferret with a gun.\n\n‘Who comes there?’ said the ferret sharply.\n\n‘Stuff and nonsense!’ said Toad, very angrily. ‘What do you mean by\ntalking like that to me? Come out of that at once, or I’ll----’\n\nThe ferret said never a word, but he brought his gun up to his shoulder.\nToad prudently dropped flat in the road, and BANG! a bullet whistled\nover his head.\n\nThe startled Toad scrambled to his feet and scampered off down the road\nas hard as he could; and as he ran he heard the ferret laughing and\nother horrid thin little laughs taking it up and carrying on the sound.\n\nHe went back, very crestfallen, and told the Water Rat.\n\n‘What did I tell you?’ said the Rat. ‘It’s no good. They’ve got sentries\nposted, and they are all armed. You must just wait.’\n\nStill, Toad was not inclined to give in all at once. So he got out the\nboat, and set off rowing up the river to where the garden front of Toad\nHall came down to the waterside.\n\nArriving within sight of his old home, he rested on his oars and\nsurveyed the land cautiously. All seemed very peaceful and deserted and\nquiet. He could see the whole front of Toad Hall, glowing in the evening\nsunshine, the pigeons settling by twos and threes along the straight\nline of the roof; the garden, a blaze of flowers; the creek that led\nup to the boat-house, the little wooden bridge that crossed it; all\ntranquil, uninhabited, apparently waiting for his return. He would try\nthe boat-house first, he thought. Very warily he paddled up to the mouth\nof the creek, and was just passing under the bridge, when ... CRASH!\n\nA great stone, dropped from above, smashed through the bottom of the\nboat. It filled and sank, and Toad found himself struggling in deep\nwater. Looking up, he saw two stoats leaning over the parapet of the\nbridge and watching him with great glee. ‘It will be your head next\ntime, Toady!’ they called out to him. The indignant Toad swam to shore,\nwhile the stoats laughed and laughed, supporting each other, and laughed\nagain, till they nearly had two fits--that is, one fit each, of course.\n\nThe Toad retraced his weary way on foot, and related his disappointing\nexperiences to the Water Rat once more.\n\n‘Well, WHAT did I tell you?’ said the Rat very crossly. ‘And, now, look\nhere! See what you’ve been and done! Lost me my boat that I was so fond\nof, that’s what you’ve done! And simply ruined that nice suit of clothes\nthat I lent you! Really, Toad, of all the trying animals--I wonder you\nmanage to keep any friends at all!’\n\nThe Toad saw at once how wrongly and foolishly he had acted. He admitted\nhis errors and wrong-headedness and made a full apology to Rat for\nlosing his boat and spoiling his clothes. And he wound up by saying,\nwith that frank self-surrender which always disarmed his friend’s\ncriticism and won them back to his side, ‘Ratty! I see that I have been\na headstrong and a wilful Toad! Henceforth, believe me, I will be humble\nand submissive, and will take no action without your kind advice and\nfull approval!’\n\n‘If that is really so,’ said the good-natured Rat, already appeased,\n‘then my advice to you is, considering the lateness of the hour, to sit\ndown and have your supper, which will be on the table in a minute, and\nbe very patient. For I am convinced that we can do nothing until we\nhave seen the Mole and the Badger, and heard their latest news, and held\nconference and taken their advice in this difficult matter.’\n\n‘Oh, ah, yes, of course, the Mole and the Badger,’ said Toad, lightly.\n‘What’s become of them, the dear fellows? I had forgotten all about\nthem.’\n\n‘Well may you ask!’ said the Rat reproachfully. ‘While you were riding\nabout the country in expensive motor-cars, and galloping proudly on\nblood-horses, and breakfasting on the fat of the land, those two poor\ndevoted animals have been camping out in the open, in every sort of\nweather, living very rough by day and lying very hard by night; watching\nover your house, patrolling your boundaries, keeping a constant eye on\nthe stoats and the weasels, scheming and planning and contriving how to\nget your property back for you. You don’t deserve to have such true and\nloyal friends, Toad, you don’t, really. Some day, when it’s too late,\nyou’ll be sorry you didn’t value them more while you had them!’\n\n‘I’m an ungrateful beast, I know,’ sobbed Toad, shedding bitter tears.\n‘Let me go out and find them, out into the cold, dark night, and share\ntheir hardships, and try and prove by----Hold on a bit! Surely I heard\nthe chink of dishes on a tray! Supper’s here at last, hooray! Come on,\nRatty!’\n\nThe Rat remembered that poor Toad had been on prison fare for a\nconsiderable time, and that large allowances had therefore to be made.\nHe followed him to the table accordingly, and hospitably encouraged him\nin his gallant efforts to make up for past privations.\n\nThey had just finished their meal and resumed their arm-chairs, when\nthere came a heavy knock at the door.\n\nToad was nervous, but the Rat, nodding mysteriously at him, went\nstraight up to the door and opened it, and in walked Mr. Badger.\n\nHe had all the appearance of one who for some nights had been kept away\nfrom home and all its little comforts and conveniences. His shoes were\ncovered with mud, and he was looking very rough and touzled; but then\nhe had never been a very smart man, the Badger, at the best of times. He\ncame solemnly up to Toad, shook him by the paw, and said, ‘Welcome home,\nToad! Alas! what am I saying? Home, indeed! This is a poor home-coming.\nUnhappy Toad!’ Then he turned his back on him, sat down to the table,\ndrew his chair up, and helped himself to a large slice of cold pie.\n\nToad was quite alarmed at this very serious and portentous style of\ngreeting; but the Rat whispered to him, ‘Never mind; don’t take any\nnotice; and don’t say anything to him just yet. He’s always rather low\nand despondent when he’s wanting his victuals. In half an hour’s time\nhe’ll be quite a different animal.’\n\nSo they waited in silence, and presently there came another and a\nlighter knock. The Rat, with a nod to Toad, went to the door and ushered\nin the Mole, very shabby and unwashed, with bits of hay and straw\nsticking in his fur.\n\n‘Hooray! Here’s old Toad!’ cried the Mole, his face beaming. ‘Fancy\nhaving you back again!’ And he began to dance round him. ‘We never\ndreamt you would turn up so soon! Why, you must have managed to escape,\nyou clever, ingenious, intelligent Toad!’\n\nThe Rat, alarmed, pulled him by the elbow; but it was too late. Toad was\npuffing and swelling already.\n\n‘Clever? O, no!’ he said. ‘I’m not really clever, according to my\nfriends. I’ve only broken out of the strongest prison in England, that’s\nall! And captured a railway train and escaped on it, that’s all! And\ndisguised myself and gone about the country humbugging everybody, that’s\nall! O, no! I’m a stupid ass, I am! I’ll tell you one or two of my\nlittle adventures, Mole, and you shall judge for yourself!’\n\n‘Well, well,’ said the Mole, moving towards the supper-table; ‘supposing\nyou talk while I eat. Not a bite since breakfast! O my! O my!’ And he\nsat down and helped himself liberally to cold beef and pickles.\n\nToad straddled on the hearth-rug, thrust his paw into his trouser-pocket\nand pulled out a handful of silver. ‘Look at that!’ he cried, displaying\nit. ‘That’s not so bad, is it, for a few minutes’ work? And how do you\nthink I done it, Mole? Horse-dealing! That’s how I done it!’\n\n‘Go on, Toad,’ said the Mole, immensely interested.\n\n‘Toad, do be quiet, please!’ said the Rat. ‘And don’t you egg him on,\nMole, when you know what he is; but please tell us as soon as possible\nwhat the position is, and what’s best to be done, now that Toad is back\nat last.’\n\n‘The position’s about as bad as it can be,’ replied the Mole grumpily;\n‘and as for what’s to be done, why, blest if I know! The Badger and I\nhave been round and round the place, by night and by day; always the\nsame thing. Sentries posted everywhere, guns poked out at us, stones\nthrown at us; always an animal on the look-out, and when they see us,\nmy! how they do laugh! That’s what annoys me most!’\n\n‘It’s a very difficult situation,’ said the Rat, reflecting deeply. ‘But\nI think I see now, in the depths of my mind, what Toad really ought to\ndo. I will tell you. He ought to----’\n\n‘No, he oughtn’t!’ shouted the Mole, with his mouth full. ‘Nothing of\nthe sort! You don’t understand. What he ought to do is, he ought to----’\n\n‘Well, I shan’t do it, anyway!’ cried Toad, getting excited. ‘I’m not\ngoing to be ordered about by you fellows! It’s my house we’re talking\nabout, and I know exactly what to do, and I’ll tell you. I’m going\nto----’\n\nBy this time they were all three talking at once, at the top of their\nvoices, and the noise was simply deafening, when a thin, dry voice made\nitself heard, saying, ‘Be quiet at once, all of you!’ and instantly\nevery one was silent.\n\nIt was the Badger, who, having finished his pie, had turned round in his\nchair and was looking at them severely. When he saw that he had secured\ntheir attention, and that they were evidently waiting for him to address\nthem, he turned back to the table again and reached out for the cheese.\nAnd so great was the respect commanded by the solid qualities of that\nadmirable animal, that not another word was uttered until he had quite\nfinished his repast and brushed the crumbs from his knees. The Toad\nfidgeted a good deal, but the Rat held him firmly down.\n\nWhen the Badger had quite done, he got up from his seat and stood before\nthe fireplace, reflecting deeply. At last he spoke.\n\n‘Toad!’ he said severely. ‘You bad, troublesome little animal! Aren’t\nyou ashamed of yourself? What do you think your father, my old friend,\nwould have said if he had been here to-night, and had known of all your\ngoings on?’\n\nToad, who was on the sofa by this time, with his legs up, rolled over on\nhis face, shaken by sobs of contrition.\n\n‘There, there!’ went on the Badger, more kindly. ‘Never mind. Stop\ncrying. We’re going to let bygones be bygones, and try and turn over a\nnew leaf. But what the Mole says is quite true. The stoats are on guard,\nat every point, and they make the best sentinels in the world. It’s\nquite useless to think of attacking the place. They’re too strong for\nus.’\n\n‘Then it’s all over,’ sobbed the Toad, crying into the sofa cushions. ‘I\nshall go and enlist for a soldier, and never see my dear Toad Hall any\nmore!’\n\n‘Come, cheer up, Toady!’ said the Badger. ‘There are more ways of\ngetting back a place than taking it by storm. I haven’t said my last\nword yet. Now I’m going to tell you a great secret.’\n\nToad sat up slowly and dried his eyes. Secrets had an immense attraction\nfor him, because he never could keep one, and he enjoyed the sort of\nunhallowed thrill he experienced when he went and told another animal,\nafter having faithfully promised not to.\n\n‘There--is--an--underground--passage,’ said the Badger, impressively,\n‘that leads from the river-bank, quite near here, right up into the\nmiddle of Toad Hall.’\n\n‘O, nonsense! Badger,’ said Toad, rather airily. ‘You’ve been listening\nto some of the yarns they spin in the public-houses about here. I know\nevery inch of Toad Hall, inside and out. Nothing of the sort, I do\nassure you!’\n\n‘My young friend,’ said the Badger, with great severity, ‘your father,\nwho was a worthy animal--a lot worthier than some others I know--was\na particular friend of mine, and told me a great deal he wouldn’t have\ndreamt of telling you. He discovered that passage--he didn’t make it,\nof course; that was done hundreds of years before he ever came to live\nthere--and he repaired it and cleaned it out, because he thought it\nmight come in useful some day, in case of trouble or danger; and he\nshowed it to me. “Don’t let my son know about it,” he said. “He’s a good\nboy, but very light and volatile in character, and simply cannot hold\nhis tongue. If he’s ever in a real fix, and it would be of use to him,\nyou may tell him about the secret passage; but not before.”’\n\nThe other animals looked hard at Toad to see how he would take it. Toad\nwas inclined to be sulky at first; but he brightened up immediately,\nlike the good fellow he was.\n\n‘Well, well,’ he said; ‘perhaps I am a bit of a talker. A popular fellow\nsuch as I am--my friends get round me--we chaff, we sparkle, we tell\nwitty stories--and somehow my tongue gets wagging. I have the gift of\nconversation. I’ve been told I ought to have a salon, whatever that may\nbe. Never mind. Go on, Badger. How’s this passage of yours going to help\nus?’\n\n‘I’ve found out a thing or two lately,’ continued the Badger. ‘I got\nOtter to disguise himself as a sweep and call at the back-door with\nbrushes over his shoulder, asking for a job. There’s going to be a big\nbanquet to-morrow night. It’s somebody’s birthday--the Chief Weasel’s,\nI believe--and all the weasels will be gathered together in the\ndining-hall, eating and drinking and laughing and carrying on,\nsuspecting nothing. No guns, no swords, no sticks, no arms of any sort\nwhatever!’\n\n‘But the sentinels will be posted as usual,’ remarked the Rat.\n\n‘Exactly,’ said the Badger; ‘that is my point. The weasels will trust\nentirely to their excellent sentinels. And that is where the passage\ncomes in. That very useful tunnel leads right up under the butler’s\npantry, next to the dining-hall!’\n\n‘Aha! that squeaky board in the butler’s pantry!’ said Toad. ‘Now I\nunderstand it!’\n\n‘We shall creep out quietly into the butler’s pantry--’ cried the Mole.\n\n‘--with our pistols and swords and sticks--’ shouted the Rat.\n\n‘--and rush in upon them,’ said the Badger.\n\n‘--and whack ‘em, and whack ‘em, and whack ‘em!’ cried the Toad in\necstasy, running round and round the room, and jumping over the chairs.\n\n‘Very well, then,’ said the Badger, resuming his usual dry manner, ‘our\nplan is settled, and there’s nothing more for you to argue and squabble\nabout. So, as it’s getting very late, all of you go right off to bed at\nonce. We will make all the necessary arrangements in the course of the\nmorning to-morrow.’\n\nToad, of course, went off to bed dutifully with the rest--he knew better\nthan to refuse--though he was feeling much too excited to sleep. But\nhe had had a long day, with many events crowded into it; and sheets and\nblankets were very friendly and comforting things, after plain straw,\nand not too much of it, spread on the stone floor of a draughty cell;\nand his head had not been many seconds on his pillow before he was\nsnoring happily. Naturally, he dreamt a good deal; about roads that ran\naway from him just when he wanted them, and canals that chased him and\ncaught him, and a barge that sailed into the banqueting-hall with his\nweek’s washing, just as he was giving a dinner-party; and he was alone\nin the secret passage, pushing onwards, but it twisted and turned round\nand shook itself, and sat up on its end; yet somehow, at the last,\nhe found himself back in Toad Hall, safe and triumphant, with all his\nfriends gathered round about him, earnestly assuring him that he really\nwas a clever Toad.\n\nHe slept till a late hour next morning, and by the time he got down\nhe found that the other animals had finished their breakfast some time\nbefore. The Mole had slipped off somewhere by himself, without telling\nany one where he was going to. The Badger sat in the arm-chair, reading\nthe paper, and not concerning himself in the slightest about what was\ngoing to happen that very evening. The Rat, on the other hand, was\nrunning round the room busily, with his arms full of weapons of every\nkind, distributing them in four little heaps on the floor, and saying\nexcitedly under his breath, as he ran, ‘Here’s-a-sword-for-the-Rat,\nhere’s-a-sword-for-the Mole, here’s-a-sword-for-the-Toad,\nhere’s-a-sword-for-the-Badger! Here’s-a-pistol-for-the-Rat,\nhere’s-a-pistol-for-the-Mole, here’s-a-pistol-for-the-Toad,\nhere’s-a-pistol-for-the-Badger!’ And so on, in a regular, rhythmical\nway, while the four little heaps gradually grew and grew.\n\n‘That’s all very well, Rat,’ said the Badger presently, looking at the\nbusy little animal over the edge of his newspaper; ‘I’m not blaming you.\nBut just let us once get past the stoats, with those detestable guns of\ntheirs, and I assure you we shan’t want any swords or pistols. We four,\nwith our sticks, once we’re inside the dining-hall, why, we shall clear\nthe floor of all the lot of them in five minutes. I’d have done the\nwhole thing by myself, only I didn’t want to deprive you fellows of the\nfun!’\n\n‘It’s as well to be on the safe side,’ said the Rat reflectively,\npolishing a pistol-barrel on his sleeve and looking along it.\n\nThe Toad, having finished his breakfast, picked up a stout stick and\nswung it vigorously, belabouring imaginary animals. ‘I’ll learn ‘em to\nsteal my house!’ he cried. ‘I’ll learn ‘em, I’ll learn ‘em!’\n\n‘Don’t say “learn ‘em,” Toad,’ said the Rat, greatly shocked. ‘It’s not\ngood English.’\n\n‘What are you always nagging at Toad for?’ inquired the Badger, rather\npeevishly. ‘What’s the matter with his English? It’s the same what I use\nmyself, and if it’s good enough for me, it ought to be good enough for\nyou!’\n\n‘I’m very sorry,’ said the Rat humbly. ‘Only I THINK it ought to be\n“teach ‘em,” not “learn ‘em.”’\n\n‘But we don’t WANT to teach ‘em,’ replied the Badger. ‘We want to LEARN\n‘em--learn ‘em, learn ‘em! And what’s more, we’re going to DO it, too!’\n\n‘Oh, very well, have it your own way,’ said the Rat. He was getting\nrather muddled about it himself, and presently he retired into a corner,\nwhere he could be heard muttering, ‘Learn ‘em, teach ‘em, teach ‘em,\nlearn ‘em!’ till the Badger told him rather sharply to leave off.\n\nPresently the Mole came tumbling into the room, evidently very pleased\nwith himself. ‘I’ve been having such fun!’ he began at once; ‘I’ve been\ngetting a rise out of the stoats!’\n\n‘I hope you’ve been very careful, Mole?’ said the Rat anxiously.\n\n‘I should hope so, too,’ said the Mole confidently. ‘I got the idea when\nI went into the kitchen, to see about Toad’s breakfast being kept\nhot for him. I found that old washerwoman-dress that he came home in\nyesterday, hanging on a towel-horse before the fire. So I put it on, and\nthe bonnet as well, and the shawl, and off I went to Toad Hall, as bold\nas you please. The sentries were on the look-out, of course, with their\nguns and their “Who comes there?” and all the rest of their nonsense.\n“Good morning, gentlemen!” says I, very respectful. “Want any washing\ndone to-day?”\n\n‘They looked at me very proud and stiff and haughty, and said, “Go away,\nwasherwoman! We don’t do any washing on duty.” “Or any other time?” says\nI. Ho, ho, ho! Wasn’t I FUNNY, Toad?’\n\n‘Poor, frivolous animal!’ said Toad, very loftily. The fact is, he felt\nexceedingly jealous of Mole for what he had just done. It was exactly\nwhat he would have liked to have done himself, if only he had thought of\nit first, and hadn’t gone and overslept himself.\n\n‘Some of the stoats turned quite pink,’ continued the Mole, ‘and the\nSergeant in charge, he said to me, very short, he said, “Now run away,\nmy good woman, run away! Don’t keep my men idling and talking on their\nposts.” “Run away?” says I; “it won’t be me that’ll be running away, in\na very short time from now!”’\n\n‘O MOLY, how could you?’ said the Rat, dismayed.\n\nThe Badger laid down his paper.\n\n‘I could see them pricking up their ears and looking at each other,’\nwent on the Mole; ‘and the Sergeant said to them, “Never mind HER; she\ndoesn’t know what she’s talking about.”’\n\n‘“O! don’t I?”’ said I. ‘“Well, let me tell you this. My daughter, she\nwashes for Mr. Badger, and that’ll show you whether I know what I’m\ntalking about; and YOU’LL know pretty soon, too! A hundred bloodthirsty\nbadgers, armed with rifles, are going to attack Toad Hall this very\nnight, by way of the paddock. Six boatloads of Rats, with pistols and\ncutlasses, will come up the river and effect a landing in the\ngarden; while a picked body of Toads, known at the Die-hards, or the\nDeath-or-Glory Toads, will storm the orchard and carry everything before\nthem, yelling for vengeance. There won’t be much left of you to wash, by\nthe time they’ve done with you, unless you clear out while you have\nthe chance!” Then I ran away, and when I was out of sight I hid; and\npresently I came creeping back along the ditch and took a peep at them\nthrough the hedge. They were all as nervous and flustered as could be,\nrunning all ways at once, and falling over each other, and every one\ngiving orders to everybody else and not listening; and the Sergeant kept\nsending off parties of stoats to distant parts of the grounds, and then\nsending other fellows to fetch ‘em back again; and I heard them\nsaying to each other, “That’s just like the weasels; they’re to stop\ncomfortably in the banqueting-hall, and have feasting and toasts and\nsongs and all sorts of fun, while we must stay on guard in the cold and\nthe dark, and in the end be cut to pieces by bloodthirsty Badgers!’”\n\n‘Oh, you silly ass, Mole!’ cried Toad, ‘You’ve been and spoilt\neverything!’\n\n‘Mole,’ said the Badger, in his dry, quiet way, ‘I perceive you have\nmore sense in your little finger than some other animals have in the\nwhole of their fat bodies. You have managed excellently, and I begin to\nhave great hopes of you. Good Mole! Clever Mole!’\n\nThe Toad was simply wild with jealousy, more especially as he couldn’t\nmake out for the life of him what the Mole had done that was so\nparticularly clever; but, fortunately for him, before he could show\ntemper or expose himself to the Badger’s sarcasm, the bell rang for\nluncheon.\n\nIt was a simple but sustaining meal--bacon and broad beans, and a\nmacaroni pudding; and when they had quite done, the Badger settled\nhimself into an arm-chair, and said, ‘Well, we’ve got our work cut out\nfor us to-night, and it will probably be pretty late before we’re quite\nthrough with it; so I’m just going to take forty winks, while I can.’\nAnd he drew a handkerchief over his face and was soon snoring.\n\nThe anxious and laborious Rat at once resumed his preparations,\nand started running between his four little heaps, muttering,\n‘Here’s-a-belt-for-the-Rat, here’s-a-belt-for-the-Mole,\nhere’s-a-belt-for-the-Toad, here’s-a-belt-for-the-Badger!’ and so on,\nwith every fresh accoutrement he produced, to which there seemed really\nno end; so the Mole drew his arm through Toad’s, led him out into the\nopen air, shoved him into a wicker chair, and made him tell him all his\nadventures from beginning to end, which Toad was only too willing to\ndo. The Mole was a good listener, and Toad, with no one to check his\nstatements or to criticise in an unfriendly spirit, rather let himself\ngo. Indeed, much that he related belonged more properly to the category\nof what-might-have-happened-had-I-only-thought-of-it-in-time-instead-of\nten-minutes-afterwards. Those are always the best and the raciest\nadventures; and why should they not be truly ours, as much as the\nsomewhat inadequate things that really come off?\n\n\n\n\nXII. THE RETURN OF ULYSSES\n\nWhen it began to grow dark, the Rat, with an air of excitement and\nmystery, summoned them back into the parlour, stood each of them up\nalongside of his little heap, and proceeded to dress them up for the\ncoming expedition. He was very earnest and thoroughgoing about it, and\nthe affair took quite a long time. First, there was a belt to go round\neach animal, and then a sword to be stuck into each belt, and then\na cutlass on the other side to balance it. Then a pair of pistols, a\npoliceman’s truncheon, several sets of handcuffs, some bandages and\nsticking-plaster, and a flask and a sandwich-case. The Badger laughed\ngood-humouredly and said, ‘All right, Ratty! It amuses you and it\ndoesn’t hurt me. I’m going to do all I’ve got to do with this here\nstick.’ But the Rat only said, ‘PLEASE, Badger. You know I shouldn’t\nlike you to blame me afterwards and say I had forgotten ANYTHING!’\n\nWhen all was quite ready, the Badger took a dark lantern in one paw,\ngrasped his great stick with the other, and said, ‘Now then, follow me!\nMole first, ‘cos I’m very pleased with him; Rat next; Toad last. And\nlook here, Toady! Don’t you chatter so much as usual, or you’ll be sent\nback, as sure as fate!’\n\nThe Toad was so anxious not to be left out that he took up the inferior\nposition assigned to him without a murmur, and the animals set off. The\nBadger led them along by the river for a little way, and then suddenly\nswung himself over the edge into a hole in the river-bank, a little\nabove the water. The Mole and the Rat followed silently, swinging\nthemselves successfully into the hole as they had seen the Badger do;\nbut when it came to Toad’s turn, of course he managed to slip and fall\ninto the water with a loud splash and a squeal of alarm. He was hauled\nout by his friends, rubbed down and wrung out hastily, comforted, and\nset on his legs; but the Badger was seriously angry, and told him that\nthe very next time he made a fool of himself he would most certainly be\nleft behind.\n\nSo at last they were in the secret passage, and the cutting-out\nexpedition had really begun!\n\nIt was cold, and dark, and damp, and low, and narrow, and poor Toad\nbegan to shiver, partly from dread of what might be before him, partly\nbecause he was wet through. The lantern was far ahead, and he could not\nhelp lagging behind a little in the darkness. Then he heard the Rat call\nout warningly, ‘COME on, Toad!’ and a terror seized him of being left\nbehind, alone in the darkness, and he ‘came on’ with such a rush that\nhe upset the Rat into the Mole and the Mole into the Badger, and for a\nmoment all was confusion. The Badger thought they were being attacked\nfrom behind, and, as there was no room to use a stick or a cutlass, drew\na pistol, and was on the point of putting a bullet into Toad. When he\nfound out what had really happened he was very angry indeed, and said,\n‘Now this time that tiresome Toad SHALL be left behind!’\n\nBut Toad whimpered, and the other two promised that they would be\nanswerable for his good conduct, and at last the Badger was pacified,\nand the procession moved on; only this time the Rat brought up the rear,\nwith a firm grip on the shoulder of Toad.\n\nSo they groped and shuffled along, with their ears pricked up and their\npaws on their pistols, till at last the Badger said, ‘We ought by now to\nbe pretty nearly under the Hall.’\n\nThen suddenly they heard, far away as it might be, and yet apparently\nnearly over their heads, a confused murmur of sound, as if people were\nshouting and cheering and stamping on the floor and hammering on tables.\nThe Toad’s nervous terrors all returned, but the Badger only remarked\nplacidly, ‘They ARE going it, the Weasels!’\n\nThe passage now began to slope upwards; they groped onward a little\nfurther, and then the noise broke out again, quite distinct this time,\nand very close above them. ‘Ooo-ray-ooray-oo-ray-ooray!’ they heard, and\nthe stamping of little feet on the floor, and the clinking of glasses\nas little fists pounded on the table. ‘WHAT a time they’re having!’ said\nthe Badger. ‘Come on!’ They hurried along the passage till it came to a\nfull stop, and they found themselves standing under the trap-door that\nled up into the butler’s pantry.\n\nSuch a tremendous noise was going on in the banqueting-hall that there\nwas little danger of their being overheard. The Badger said, ‘Now, boys,\nall together!’ and the four of them put their shoulders to the trap-door\nand heaved it back. Hoisting each other up, they found themselves\nstanding in the pantry, with only a door between them and the\nbanqueting-hall, where their unconscious enemies were carousing.\n\nThe noise, as they emerged from the passage, was simply deafening. At\nlast, as the cheering and hammering slowly subsided, a voice could\nbe made out saying, ‘Well, I do not propose to detain you much\nlonger’--(great applause)--‘but before I resume my seat’--(renewed\ncheering)--‘I should like to say one word about our kind host, Mr. Toad.\nWe all know Toad!’--(great laughter)--‘GOOD Toad, MODEST Toad, HONEST\nToad!’ (shrieks of merriment).\n\n‘Only just let me get at him!’ muttered Toad, grinding his teeth.\n\n‘Hold hard a minute!’ said the Badger, restraining him with difficulty.\n‘Get ready, all of you!’\n\n‘--Let me sing you a little song,’ went on the voice, ‘which I have\ncomposed on the subject of Toad’--(prolonged applause).\n\nThen the Chief Weasel--for it was he--began in a high, squeaky voice--\n\n          ‘Toad he went a-pleasuring\n          Gaily down the street--’\n\nThe Badger drew himself up, took a firm grip of his stick with both\npaws, glanced round at his comrades, and cried--\n\n‘The hour is come! Follow me!’\n\nAnd flung the door open wide.\n\nMy!\n\nWhat a squealing and a squeaking and a screeching filled the air!\n\nWell might the terrified weasels dive under the tables and spring madly\nup at the windows! Well might the ferrets rush wildly for the fireplace\nand get hopelessly jammed in the chimney! Well might tables and chairs\nbe upset, and glass and china be sent crashing on the floor, in the\npanic of that terrible moment when the four Heroes strode wrathfully\ninto the room! The mighty Badger, his whiskers bristling, his great\ncudgel whistling through the air; Mole, black and grim, brandishing his\nstick and shouting his awful war-cry, ‘A Mole! A Mole!’ Rat; desperate\nand determined, his belt bulging with weapons of every age and every\nvariety; Toad, frenzied with excitement and injured pride, swollen to\ntwice his ordinary size, leaping into the air and emitting Toad-whoops\nthat chilled them to the marrow! ‘Toad he went a-pleasuring!’ he yelled.\n‘I’LL pleasure ‘em!’ and he went straight for the Chief Weasel. They\nwere but four in all, but to the panic-stricken weasels the hall seemed\nfull of monstrous animals, grey, black, brown and yellow, whooping and\nflourishing enormous cudgels; and they broke and fled with squeals\nof terror and dismay, this way and that, through the windows, up the\nchimney, anywhere to get out of reach of those terrible sticks.\n\nThe affair was soon over. Up and down, the whole length of the hall,\nstrode the four Friends, whacking with their sticks at every head that\nshowed itself; and in five minutes the room was cleared. Through the\nbroken windows the shrieks of terrified weasels escaping across the lawn\nwere borne faintly to their ears; on the floor lay prostrate some dozen\nor so of the enemy, on whom the Mole was busily engaged in fitting\nhandcuffs. The Badger, resting from his labours, leant on his stick and\nwiped his honest brow.\n\n‘Mole,’ he said,’ ‘you’re the best of fellows! Just cut along outside\nand look after those stoat-sentries of yours, and see what they’re\ndoing. I’ve an idea that, thanks to you, we shan’t have much trouble\nfrom them to-night!’\n\nThe Mole vanished promptly through a window; and the Badger bade the\nother two set a table on its legs again, pick up knives and forks and\nplates and glasses from the debris on the floor, and see if they could\nfind materials for a supper. ‘I want some grub, I do,’ he said, in that\nrather common way he had of speaking. ‘Stir your stumps, Toad, and look\nlively! We’ve got your house back for you, and you don’t offer us so\nmuch as a sandwich.’ Toad felt rather hurt that the Badger didn’t say\npleasant things to him, as he had to the Mole, and tell him what a\nfine fellow he was, and how splendidly he had fought; for he was rather\nparticularly pleased with himself and the way he had gone for the Chief\nWeasel and sent him flying across the table with one blow of his stick.\nBut he bustled about, and so did the Rat, and soon they found some guava\njelly in a glass dish, and a cold chicken, a tongue that had hardly\nbeen touched, some trifle, and quite a lot of lobster salad; and in the\npantry they came upon a basketful of French rolls and any quantity of\ncheese, butter, and celery. They were just about to sit down when the\nMole clambered in through the window, chuckling, with an armful of\nrifles.\n\n‘It’s all over,’ he reported. ‘From what I can make out, as soon as the\nstoats, who were very nervous and jumpy already, heard the shrieks and\nthe yells and the uproar inside the hall, some of them threw down their\nrifles and fled. The others stood fast for a bit, but when the weasels\ncame rushing out upon them they thought they were betrayed; and the\nstoats grappled with the weasels, and the weasels fought to get away,\nand they wrestled and wriggled and punched each other, and rolled\nover and over, till most of ‘em rolled into the river! They’ve all\ndisappeared by now, one way or another; and I’ve got their rifles. So\nthat’s all right!’\n\n‘Excellent and deserving animal!’ said the Badger, his mouth full of\nchicken and trifle. ‘Now, there’s just one more thing I want you to do,\nMole, before you sit down to your supper along of us; and I wouldn’t\ntrouble you only I know I can trust you to see a thing done, and I wish\nI could say the same of every one I know. I’d send Rat, if he wasn’t a\npoet. I want you to take those fellows on the floor there upstairs with\nyou, and have some bedrooms cleaned out and tidied up and made really\ncomfortable. See that they sweep UNDER the beds, and put clean sheets\nand pillow-cases on, and turn down one corner of the bed-clothes, just\nas you know it ought to be done; and have a can of hot water, and clean\ntowels, and fresh cakes of soap, put in each room. And then you can give\nthem a licking a-piece, if it’s any satisfaction to you, and put them\nout by the back-door, and we shan’t see any more of THEM, I fancy. And\nthen come along and have some of this cold tongue. It’s first rate. I’m\nvery pleased with you, Mole!’\n\nThe goodnatured Mole picked up a stick, formed his prisoners up in a\nline on the floor, gave them the order ‘Quick march!’ and led his squad\noff to the upper floor. After a time, he appeared again, smiling, and\nsaid that every room was ready, and as clean as a new pin. ‘And I didn’t\nhave to lick them, either,’ he added. ‘I thought, on the whole, they had\nhad licking enough for one night, and the weasels, when I put the point\nto them, quite agreed with me, and said they wouldn’t think of troubling\nme. They were very penitent, and said they were extremely sorry for\nwhat they had done, but it was all the fault of the Chief Weasel and the\nstoats, and if ever they could do anything for us at any time to make\nup, we had only got to mention it. So I gave them a roll a-piece, and\nlet them out at the back, and off they ran, as hard as they could!’\n\nThen the Mole pulled his chair up to the table, and pitched into the\ncold tongue; and Toad, like the gentleman he was, put all his jealousy\nfrom him, and said heartily, ‘Thank you kindly, dear Mole, for all\nyour pains and trouble tonight, and especially for your cleverness this\nmorning!’ The Badger was pleased at that, and said, ‘There spoke my\nbrave Toad!’ So they finished their supper in great joy and contentment,\nand presently retired to rest between clean sheets, safe in Toad’s\nancestral home, won back by matchless valour, consummate strategy, and a\nproper handling of sticks.\n\nThe following morning, Toad, who had overslept himself as usual, came\ndown to breakfast disgracefully late, and found on the table a certain\nquantity of egg-shells, some fragments of cold and leathery toast, a\ncoffee-pot three-fourths empty, and really very little else; which did\nnot tend to improve his temper, considering that, after all, it was his\nown house. Through the French windows of the breakfast-room he could\nsee the Mole and the Water Rat sitting in wicker-chairs out on the lawn,\nevidently telling each other stories; roaring with laughter and kicking\ntheir short legs up in the air. The Badger, who was in an arm-chair and\ndeep in the morning paper, merely looked up and nodded when Toad entered\nthe room. But Toad knew his man, so he sat down and made the best\nbreakfast he could, merely observing to himself that he would get square\nwith the others sooner or later. When he had nearly finished, the Badger\nlooked up and remarked rather shortly: ‘I’m sorry, Toad, but I’m afraid\nthere’s a heavy morning’s work in front of you. You see, we really ought\nto have a Banquet at once, to celebrate this affair. It’s expected of\nyou--in fact, it’s the rule.’\n\n‘O, all right!’ said the Toad, readily. ‘Anything to oblige. Though\nwhy on earth you should want to have a Banquet in the morning I cannot\nunderstand. But you know I do not live to please myself, but merely to\nfind out what my friends want, and then try and arrange it for ‘em, you\ndear old Badger!’\n\n‘Don’t pretend to be stupider than you really are,’ replied the Badger,\ncrossly; ‘and don’t chuckle and splutter in your coffee while you’re\ntalking; it’s not manners. What I mean is, the Banquet will be at night,\nof course, but the invitations will have to be written and got off at\nonce, and you’ve got to write ‘em. Now, sit down at that table--there’s\nstacks of letter-paper on it, with “Toad Hall” at the top in blue and\ngold--and write invitations to all our friends, and if you stick to it\nwe shall get them out before luncheon. And I’LL bear a hand, too; and\ntake my share of the burden. I’LL order the Banquet.’\n\n‘What!’ cried Toad, dismayed. ‘Me stop indoors and write a lot of\nrotten letters on a jolly morning like this, when I want to go around my\nproperty, and set everything and everybody to rights, and swagger about\nand enjoy myself! Certainly not! I’ll be--I’ll see you----Stop a minute,\nthough! Why, of course, dear Badger! What is my pleasure or convenience\ncompared with that of others! You wish it done, and it shall be done.\nGo, Badger, order the Banquet, order what you like; then join our young\nfriends outside in their innocent mirth, oblivious of me and my cares\nand toils. I sacrifice this fair morning on the altar of duty and\nfriendship!’\n\nThe Badger looked at him very suspiciously, but Toad’s frank, open\ncountenance made it difficult to suggest any unworthy motive in this\nchange of attitude. He quitted the room, accordingly, in the direction\nof the kitchen, and as soon as the door had closed behind him, Toad\nhurried to the writing-table. A fine idea had occurred to him while he\nwas talking. He WOULD write the invitations; and he would take care to\nmention the leading part he had taken in the fight, and how he had laid\nthe Chief Weasel flat; and he would hint at his adventures, and what a\ncareer of triumph he had to tell about; and on the fly-leaf he would set\nout a sort of a programme of entertainment for the evening--something\nlike this, as he sketched it out in his head:--\n\n  SPEECH. . . . BY TOAD.\n  (There will be other speeches by TOAD during the evening.)\n\n  ADDRESS. . . BY TOAD\n\n  SYNOPSIS--Our Prison System--the Waterways of Old\n  England--Horse-dealing, and how to deal--Property,\n  its rights and its duties--Back to the Land--\n  A Typical English Squire.\n\n  SONG. . . . BY TOAD. (Composed by himself.)\n\n  OTHER COMPOSITIONS. BY TOAD\n  will be sung in the course of the evening\n  by the. . . COMPOSER.\n\n\nThe idea pleased him mightily, and he worked very hard and got all the\nletters finished by noon, at which hour it was reported to him that\nthere was a small and rather bedraggled weasel at the door, inquiring\ntimidly whether he could be of any service to the gentlemen. Toad\nswaggered out and found it was one of the prisoners of the previous\nevening, very respectful and anxious to please. He patted him on the\nhead, shoved the bundle of invitations into his paw, and told him to\ncut along quick and deliver them as fast as he could, and if he liked\nto come back again in the evening, perhaps there might be a shilling\nfor him, or, again, perhaps there mightn’t; and the poor weasel seemed\nreally quite grateful, and hurried off eagerly to do his mission.\n\nWhen the other animals came back to luncheon, very boisterous and\nbreezy after a morning on the river, the Mole, whose conscience had been\npricking him, looked doubtfully at Toad, expecting to find him sulky or\ndepressed. Instead, he was so uppish and inflated that the Mole began\nto suspect something; while the Rat and the Badger exchanged significant\nglances.\n\nAs soon as the meal was over, Toad thrust his paws deep into his\ntrouser-pockets, remarked casually, ‘Well, look after yourselves, you\nfellows! Ask for anything you want!’ and was swaggering off in the\ndirection of the garden, where he wanted to think out an idea or two for\nhis coming speeches, when the Rat caught him by the arm.\n\nToad rather suspected what he was after, and did his best to get away;\nbut when the Badger took him firmly by the other arm he began to see\nthat the game was up. The two animals conducted him between them into\nthe small smoking-room that opened out of the entrance-hall, shut the\ndoor, and put him into a chair. Then they both stood in front of\nhim, while Toad sat silent and regarded them with much suspicion and\nill-humour.\n\n‘Now, look here, Toad,’ said the Rat. ‘It’s about this Banquet, and\nvery sorry I am to have to speak to you like this. But we want you to\nunderstand clearly, once and for all, that there are going to be no\nspeeches and no songs. Try and grasp the fact that on this occasion\nwe’re not arguing with you; we’re just telling you.’\n\nToad saw that he was trapped. They understood him, they saw through him,\nthey had got ahead of him. His pleasant dream was shattered.\n\n‘Mayn’t I sing them just one LITTLE song?’ he pleaded piteously.\n\n‘No, not ONE little song,’ replied the Rat firmly, though his heart bled\nas he noticed the trembling lip of the poor disappointed Toad. ‘It’s no\ngood, Toady; you know well that your songs are all conceit and boasting\nand vanity; and your speeches are all self-praise and--and--well, and\ngross exaggeration and--and----’\n\n‘And gas,’ put in the Badger, in his common way.\n\n‘It’s for your own good, Toady,’ went on the Rat. ‘You know you MUST\nturn over a new leaf sooner or later, and now seems a splendid time to\nbegin; a sort of turning-point in your career. Please don’t think that\nsaying all this doesn’t hurt me more than it hurts you.’\n\nToad remained a long while plunged in thought. At last he raised his\nhead, and the traces of strong emotion were visible on his features.\n‘You have conquered, my friends,’ he said in broken accents. ‘It was,\nto be sure, but a small thing that I asked--merely leave to blossom\nand expand for yet one more evening, to let myself go and hear the\ntumultuous applause that always seems to me--somehow--to bring out my\nbest qualities. However, you are right, I know, and I am wrong. Hence\nforth I will be a very different Toad. My friends, you shall never have\noccasion to blush for me again. But, O dear, O dear, this is a hard\nworld!’\n\nAnd, pressing his handkerchief to his face, he left the room, with\nfaltering footsteps.\n\n‘Badger,’ said the Rat, ‘_I_ feel like a brute; I wonder what YOU feel\nlike?’\n\n‘O, I know, I know,’ said the Badger gloomily. ‘But the thing had to be\ndone. This good fellow has got to live here, and hold his own, and be\nrespected. Would you have him a common laughing-stock, mocked and jeered\nat by stoats and weasels?’\n\n‘Of course not,’ said the Rat. ‘And, talking of weasels, it’s lucky we\ncame upon that little weasel, just as he was setting out with Toad’s\ninvitations. I suspected something from what you told me, and had a look\nat one or two; they were simply disgraceful. I confiscated the lot,\nand the good Mole is now sitting in the blue boudoir, filling up plain,\nsimple invitation cards.’\n\n* * * * *\n\nAt last the hour for the banquet began to draw near, and Toad, who on\nleaving the others had retired to his bedroom, was still sitting there,\nmelancholy and thoughtful. His brow resting on his paw, he pondered long\nand deeply. Gradually his countenance cleared, and he began to smile\nlong, slow smiles. Then he took to giggling in a shy, self-conscious\nmanner. At last he got up, locked the door, drew the curtains across\nthe windows, collected all the chairs in the room and arranged them in a\nsemicircle, and took up his position in front of them, swelling visibly.\nThen he bowed, coughed twice, and, letting himself go, with uplifted\nvoice he sang, to the enraptured audience that his imagination so\nclearly saw.\n\n\n                  TOAD’S LAST LITTLE SONG!\n\n  The Toad--came--home!\n  There was panic in the parlours and howling in the halls,\n  There was crying in the cow-sheds and shrieking in the stalls,\n  When the Toad--came--home!\n\n  When the Toad--came--home!\n  There was smashing in of window and crashing in of door,\n  There was chivvying of weasels that fainted on the floor,\n  When the Toad--came--home!\n\n  Bang! go the drums!\n  The trumpeters are tooting and the soldiers are saluting,\n  And the cannon they are shooting and the motor-cars are hooting,\n  As the--Hero--comes!\n\n  Shout--Hoo-ray!\n  And let each one of the crowd try and shout it very loud,\n  In honour of an animal of whom you’re justly proud,\n  For it’s Toad’s--great--day!\n\n\nHe sang this very loud, with great unction and expression; and when he\nhad done, he sang it all over again.\n\nThen he heaved a deep sigh; a long, long, long sigh.\n\nThen he dipped his hairbrush in the water-jug, parted his hair in the\nmiddle, and plastered it down very straight and sleek on each side of\nhis face; and, unlocking the door, went quietly down the stairs to greet\nhis guests, who he knew must be assembling in the drawing-room.\n\nAll the animals cheered when he entered, and crowded round to\ncongratulate him and say nice things about his courage, and his\ncleverness, and his fighting qualities; but Toad only smiled faintly,\nand murmured, ‘Not at all!’ Or, sometimes, for a change, ‘On the\ncontrary!’ Otter, who was standing on the hearthrug, describing to an\nadmiring circle of friends exactly how he would have managed things had\nhe been there, came forward with a shout, threw his arm round Toad’s\nneck, and tried to take him round the room in triumphal progress; but\nToad, in a mild way, was rather snubby to him, remarking gently, as he\ndisengaged himself, ‘Badger’s was the mastermind; the Mole and the Water\nRat bore the brunt of the fighting; I merely served in the ranks and did\nlittle or nothing.’ The animals were evidently puzzled and taken aback\nby this unexpected attitude of his; and Toad felt, as he moved from one\nguest to the other, making his modest responses, that he was an object\nof absorbing interest to every one.\n\nThe Badger had ordered everything of the best, and the banquet was a\ngreat success. There was much talking and laughter and chaff among the\nanimals, but through it all Toad, who of course was in the chair, looked\ndown his nose and murmured pleasant nothings to the animals on either\nside of him. At intervals he stole a glance at the Badger and the Rat,\nand always when he looked they were staring at each other with their\nmouths open; and this gave him the greatest satisfaction. Some of the\nyounger and livelier animals, as the evening wore on, got whispering\nto each other that things were not so amusing as they used to be in the\ngood old days; and there were some knockings on the table and cries of\n‘Toad! Speech! Speech from Toad! Song! Mr. Toad’s song!’ But Toad only\nshook his head gently, raised one paw in mild protest, and, by pressing\ndelicacies on his guests, by topical small-talk, and by earnest\ninquiries after members of their families not yet old enough to appear\nat social functions, managed to convey to them that this dinner was\nbeing run on strictly conventional lines.\n\nHe was indeed an altered Toad!\n\n* * * * *\n\nAfter this climax, the four animals continued to lead their lives,\nso rudely broken in upon by civil war, in great joy and contentment,\nundisturbed by further risings or invasions. Toad, after due\nconsultation with his friends, selected a handsome gold chain and locket\nset with pearls, which he dispatched to the gaoler’s daughter with\na letter that even the Badger admitted to be modest, grateful, and\nappreciative; and the engine-driver, in his turn, was properly thanked\nand compensated for all his pains and trouble. Under severe compulsion\nfrom the Badger, even the barge-woman was, with some trouble, sought\nout and the value of her horse discreetly made good to her; though Toad\nkicked terribly at this, holding himself to be an instrument of Fate,\nsent to punish fat women with mottled arms who couldn’t tell a real\ngentleman when they saw one. The amount involved, it was true, was not\nvery burdensome, the gipsy’s valuation being admitted by local assessors\nto be approximately correct.\n\nSometimes, in the course of long summer evenings, the friends would take\na stroll together in the Wild Wood, now successfully tamed so far as\nthey were concerned; and it was pleasing to see how respectfully they\nwere greeted by the inhabitants, and how the mother-weasels would bring\ntheir young ones to the mouths of their holes, and say, pointing, ‘Look,\nbaby! There goes the great Mr. Toad! And that’s the gallant Water Rat, a\nterrible fighter, walking along o’ him! And yonder comes the famous Mr.\nMole, of whom you so often have heard your father tell!’ But when their\ninfants were fractious and quite beyond control, they would quiet them\nby telling how, if they didn’t hush them and not fret them, the terrible\ngrey Badger would up and get them. This was a base libel on Badger, who,\nthough he cared little about Society, was rather fond of children; but\nit never failed to have its full effect."
