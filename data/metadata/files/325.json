The first is to rescue the work from an edition illustrated\nwithout the author’s sanction, and so unsuitably that all lovers of the\nbook must have experienced some real grief in turning its pages. With\nthe copyright I secured also the whole of that edition and turned it\ninto pulp.\n\nMy second reason is to pay a small tribute to my father by way of\npersonal gratitude for this, his first prose work, which was published\nnearly fifty years ago. Though unknown to many lovers of his greater\nwritings, none of these has exceeded it in imaginative insight and power\nof expression. To me it rings with the dominant chord of his life’s\npurpose and work.\n\nMy third reason is that wider knowledge and love of the book should\nbe made possible. To this end I have been most happy in the help of my\nfather’s old friend, who has illustrated the book. I know of no other\nliving artist who is capable of portraying the spirit of Phantastes;\nand every reader of this edition will, I believe, feel that the\nillustrations are a part of the romance, and will gain through them\nsome perception of the brotherhood between George MacDonald and Arthur\nHughes.\n\nGREVILLE MACDONALD.\n\nSeptember 1905.\n\n\n\n\n\nPHANTASTES A FAERIE ROMANCE\n\n\n    “Phantastes from ‘their fount all shapes deriving,\n    In new habiliments can quickly dight.”\n                             FLETCHER’S Purple Island\n\n\n     Es lassen sich Erzählungen ohne Zusammenhang, jedoch mit\n     Association, wie Träume, denken; Gedichte, die bloss\n     wohlklingend und voll schöner Worte sind, aber auch ohne\n     allen Sinn und Zusammenhang, höchstens einzelne Strophen\n     verständlich, wie Bruchstücke aus den verschiedenartigsten\n     Dingen. Diese wahre Poesie kann höchstens einen\n     allegorischen Sinn in Grossen, und eine indirecte Wirkung,\n     wie Musik, haben. Darum ist die Natur so rein poetisch, wie\n     die Stube eines Zauberers, eines Physikers, eine\n     Kinderstube, eine Polter- und Vorrathskammer.\n\n     Ein Märchen ist wie ein Traumbild ohne Zusammenhang. Ein\n     Ensemble wunderbarer Dinge und Begebenheiten, z. B. eine\n     musikalische Phantasie, die harmonischen Folgen einer\n     Aeolsharfe, die Natur selbst...\n\n     In einem echten Märchen muss alles wunderbar, geheimnissvoll\n     und zusammenhängend sein; alles belebt, jeder auf eine\n     andere Art. Die ganze Natur muss wunderlich mit der ganzen\n     Geisterwelt gemischt sein; hier tritt die Zeit der Anarchie,\n     der Gesetzlosigkeit, Freiheit, der Naturstand der Natur, die\n     Zeit von der Welt ein . . . Die Welt des Märchens ist die,\n     der Welt der Wahrheit durchaus entgegengesetzte, und eben\n     darum ihr so durchaus ähnlich, wie das Chaos der vollendeten\n     Schöpfung ähnlich ist.--NOVALIS.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n                       “A spirit  .  .  .\n                    .  .  .  .  .  .\n    The undulating and silent well,\n    And rippling rivulet, and evening gloom,\n    Now deepening the dark shades, for speech assuming,\n    Held commune with him; as if he and it\n    Were all that was.”\n                             SHELLEY’S Alastor.\n\n\nI awoke one morning with the usual perplexity of mind which accompanies\nthe return of consciousness. As I lay and looked through the eastern\nwindow of my room, a faint streak of peach-colour, dividing a cloud that\njust rose above the low swell of the horizon, announced the approach of\nthe sun. As my thoughts, which a deep and apparently dreamless sleep had\ndissolved, began again to assume crystalline forms, the strange events\nof the foregoing night presented themselves anew to my wondering\nconsciousness. The day before had been my one-and-twentieth birthday.\nAmong other ceremonies investing me with my legal rights, the keys of an\nold secretary, in which my father had kept his private papers, had been\ndelivered up to me. As soon as I was left alone, I ordered lights in the\nchamber where the secretary stood, the first lights that had been there\nfor many a year; for, since my father’s death, the room had been left\nundisturbed. But, as if the darkness had been too long an inmate to\nbe easily expelled, and had dyed with blackness the walls to which,\nbat-like, it had clung, these tapers served but ill to light up the\ngloomy hangings, and seemed to throw yet darker shadows into the hollows\nof the deep-wrought cornice. All the further portions of the room lay\nshrouded in a mystery whose deepest folds were gathered around the dark\noak cabinet which I now approached with a strange mingling of reverence\nand curiosity. Perhaps, like a geologist, I was about to turn up to\nthe light some of the buried strata of the human world, with its fossil\nremains charred by passion and petrified by tears. Perhaps I was to\nlearn how my father, whose personal history was unknown to me, had woven\nhis web of story; how he had found the world, and how the world had left\nhim. Perhaps I was to find only the records of lands and moneys, how\ngotten and how secured; coming down from strange men, and through\ntroublous times, to me, who knew little or nothing of them all. To solve\nmy speculations, and to dispel the awe which was fast gathering around\nme as if the dead were drawing near, I approached the secretary; and\nhaving found the key that fitted the upper portion, I opened it with\nsome difficulty, drew near it a heavy high-backed chair, and sat down\nbefore a multitude of little drawers and slides and pigeon-holes. But\nthe door of a little cupboard in the centre especially attracted my\ninterest, as if there lay the secret of this long-hidden world. Its key\nI found.\n\nOne of the rusty hinges cracked and broke as I opened the door: it\nrevealed a number of small pigeon-holes. These, however, being but\nshallow compared with the depth of those around the little cupboard, the\nouter ones reaching to the back of the desk, I concluded that there\nmust be some accessible space behind; and found, indeed, that they were\nformed in a separate framework, which admitted of the whole being pulled\nout in one piece. Behind, I found a sort of flexible portcullis of small\nbars of wood laid close together horizontally. After long search, and\ntrying many ways to move it, I discovered at last a scarcely projecting\npoint of steel on one side. I pressed this repeatedly and hard with\nthe point of an old tool that was lying near, till at length it\nyielded inwards; and the little slide, flying up suddenly, disclosed a\nchamber--empty, except that in one corner lay a little heap of withered\nrose-leaves, whose long-lived scent had long since departed; and, in\nanother, a small packet of papers, tied with a bit of ribbon, whose\ncolour had gone with the rose-scent. Almost fearing to touch them, they\nwitnessed so mutely to the law of oblivion, I leaned back in my chair,\nand regarded them for a moment; when suddenly there stood on the\nthreshold of the little chamber, as though she had just emerged from its\ndepth, a tiny woman-form, as perfect in shape as if she had been a small\nGreek statuette roused to life and motion. Her dress was of a kind that\ncould never grow old-fashioned, because it was simply natural: a robe\nplaited in a band around the neck, and confined by a belt about the\nwaist, descended to her feet. It was only afterwards, however, that I\ntook notice of her dress, although my surprise was by no means of so\noverpowering a degree as such an apparition might naturally be expected\nto excite. Seeing, however, as I suppose, some astonishment in my\ncountenance, she came forward within a yard of me, and said, in a voice\nthat strangely recalled a sensation of twilight, and reedy river banks,\nand a low wind, even in this deathly room:--\n\n“Anodos, you never saw such a little creature before, did you?”\n\n“No,” said I; “and indeed I hardly believe I do now.”\n\n“Ah! that is always the way with you men; you believe nothing the first\ntime; and it is foolish enough to let mere repetition convince you of\nwhat you consider in itself unbelievable. I am not going to argue with\nyou, however, but to grant you a wish.”\n\n Here I could not help interrupting her with the foolish speech,\nof which, however, I had no cause to repent--\n\n“How can such a very little creature as you grant or refuse anything?”\n\n“Is that all the philosophy you have gained in one-and-twenty years?”\n said she. “Form is much, but size is nothing. It is a mere matter of\nrelation. I suppose your six-foot lordship does not feel altogether\ninsignificant, though to others you do look small beside your old Uncle\nRalph, who rises above you a great half-foot at least. But size is of so\nlittle consequence with old me, that I may as well accommodate myself to\nyour foolish prejudices.”\n\nSo saying, she leapt from the desk upon the floor, where she stood a\ntall, gracious lady, with pale face and large blue eyes. Her dark hair\nflowed behind, wavy but uncurled, down to her waist, and against it her\nform stood clear in its robe of white.\n\n“Now,” said she, “you will believe me.”\n\nOvercome with the presence of a beauty which I could now perceive, and\ndrawn towards her by an attraction irresistible as incomprehensible, I\nsuppose I stretched out my arms towards her, for she drew back a step or\ntwo, and said--\n\n“Foolish boy, if you could touch me, I should hurt you. Besides, I was\ntwo hundred and thirty-seven years old, last Midsummer eve; and a man\nmust not fall in love with his grandmother, you know.”\n\n“But you are not my grandmother,” said I.\n\n“How do you know that?” she retorted. “I dare say you know something of\nyour great-grandfathers a good deal further back than that; but you know\nvery little about your great-grandmothers on either side. Now, to the\npoint. Your little sister was reading a fairy-tale to you last night.”\n\n“She was.”\n\n“When she had finished, she said, as she closed the book, ‘Is there a\nfairy-country, brother?’ You replied with a sigh, ‘I suppose there is,\nif one could find the way into it.’”\n\n“I did; but I meant something quite different from what you seem to\nthink.”\n\n“Never mind what I seem to think. You shall find the way into Fairy Land\nto-morrow. Now look in my eyes.”\n\nEagerly I did so. They filled me with an unknown longing. I remembered\nsomehow that my mother died when I was a baby. I looked deeper and\ndeeper, till they spread around me like seas, and I sank in their\nwaters. I forgot all the rest, till I found myself at the window, whose\ngloomy curtains were withdrawn, and where I stood gazing on a whole\nheaven of stars, small and sparkling in the moonlight. Below lay a sea,\nstill as death and hoary in the moon, sweeping into bays and around\ncapes and islands, away, away, I knew not whither. Alas! it was no\nsea, but a low bog burnished by the moon. “Surely there is such a sea\nsomewhere!” said I to myself. A low sweet voice beside me replied--\n\n“In Fairy Land, Anodos.”\n\nI turned, but saw no one. I closed the secretary, and went to my own\nroom, and to bed.\n\nAll this I recalled as I lay with half-closed eyes. I was soon to find\nthe truth of the lady’s promise, that this day I should discover the\nroad into Fairy Land.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n     “‘Where is the stream?’ cried he, with tears. ‘Seest thou\n     its not in blue waves above us?’ He looked up, and lo! the\n     blue stream was flowing gently over their heads.”\n      --NOVALIS, Heinrich von Ofterdingen.\n\nWhile these strange events were passing through my mind, I suddenly, as\none awakes to the consciousness that the sea has been moaning by him for\nhours, or that the storm has been howling about his window all night,\nbecame aware of the sound of running water near me; and, looking out of\nbed, I saw that a large green marble basin, in which I was wont to wash,\nand which stood on a low pedestal of the same material in a corner of\nmy room, was overflowing like a spring; and that a stream of clear water\nwas running over the carpet, all the length of the room, finding its\noutlet I knew not where. And, stranger still, where this carpet, which\nI had myself designed to imitate a field of grass and daisies, bordered\nthe course of the little stream, the grass-blades and daisies seemed to\nwave in a tiny breeze that followed the water’s flow; while under the\nrivulet they bent and swayed with every motion of the changeful current,\nas if they were about to dissolve with it, and, forsaking their fixed\nform, become fluent as the waters.\n\nMy dressing-table was an old-fashioned piece of furniture of black\noak, with drawers all down the front. These were elaborately carved\nin foliage, of which ivy formed the chief part. The nearer end of this\ntable remained just as it had been, but on the further end a singular\nchange had commenced. I happened to fix my eye on a little cluster of\nivy-leaves. The first of these was evidently the work of the carver; the\nnext looked curious; the third was unmistakable ivy; and just beyond it\na tendril of clematis had twined itself about the gilt handle of one of\nthe drawers. Hearing next a slight motion above me, I looked up, and saw\nthat the branches and leaves designed upon the curtains of my bed were\nslightly in motion. Not knowing what change might follow next, I thought\nit high time to get up; and, springing from the bed, my bare feet\nalighted upon a cool green sward; and although I dressed in all haste,\nI found myself completing my toilet under the boughs of a great\ntree, whose top waved in the golden stream of the sunrise with many\ninterchanging lights, and with shadows of leaf and branch gliding over\nleaf and branch, as the cool morning wind swung it to and fro, like a\nsinking sea-wave.\n\nAfter washing as well as I could in the clear stream, I rose and looked\naround me. The tree under which I seemed to have lain all night was one\nof the advanced guard of a dense forest, towards which the rivulet ran.\nFaint traces of a footpath, much overgrown with grass and moss, and with\nhere and there a pimpernel even, were discernible along the right bank.\n“This,” thought I, “must surely be the path into Fairy Land, which\nthe lady of last night promised I should so soon find.” I crossed the\nrivulet, and accompanied it, keeping the footpath on its right bank,\nuntil it led me, as I expected, into the wood. Here I left it, without\nany good reason: and with a vague feeling that I ought to have followed\nits course, I took a more southerly direction.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n            “Man doth usurp all space,\n             Stares thee, in rock, bush, river, in\n                    the face.\n             Never thine eyes behold a tree;\n             ‘Tis no sea thou seest in the sea,\n             ‘Tis but a disguised humanity.\n             To avoid thy fellow, vain thy plan;\n             All that interests a man, is man.”\n                                         HENRY SUTTON.\n\nThe trees, which were far apart where I entered, giving free passage\nto the level rays of the sun, closed rapidly as I advanced, so that ere\nlong their crowded stems barred the sunlight out, forming as it were a\nthick grating between me and the East. I seemed to be advancing towards\na second midnight. In the midst of the intervening twilight, however,\nbefore I entered what appeared to be the darkest portion of the forest,\nI saw a country maiden coming towards me from its very depths. She did\nnot seem to observe me, for she was apparently intent upon a bunch of\nwild flowers which she carried in her hand. I could hardly see her face;\nfor, though she came direct towards me, she never looked up. But when we\nmet, instead of passing, she turned and walked alongside of me for a few\nyards, still keeping her face downwards, and busied with her flowers.\nShe spoke rapidly, however, all the time, in a low tone, as if talking\nto herself, but evidently addressing the purport of her words to me.\n\nShe seemed afraid of being observed by some lurking foe. “Trust the\nOak,” said she; “trust the Oak, and the Elm, and the great Beech. Take\ncare of the Birch, for though she is honest, she is too young not to be\nchangeable. But shun the Ash and the Alder; for the Ash is an ogre,--you\nwill know him by his thick fingers; and the Alder will smother you with\nher web of hair, if you let her near you at night.” All this was uttered\nwithout pause or alteration of tone. Then she turned suddenly and left\nme, walking still with the same unchanging gait. I could not conjecture\nwhat she meant, but satisfied myself with thinking that it would be time\nenough to find out her meaning when there was need to make use of her\nwarning, and that the occasion would reveal the admonition. I concluded\nfrom the flowers that she carried, that the forest could not be\neverywhere so dense as it appeared from where I was now walking; and I\nwas right in this conclusion. For soon I came to a more open part, and\nby-and-by crossed a wide grassy glade, on which were several circles of\nbrighter green. But even here I was struck with the utter stillness. No\nbird sang. No insect hummed. Not a living creature crossed my way. Yet\nsomehow the whole environment seemed only asleep, and to wear even in\nsleep an air of expectation. The trees seemed all to have an expression\nof conscious mystery, as if they said to themselves, “we could, an’ if\nwe would.” They had all a meaning look about them. Then I remembered\nthat night is the fairies’ day, and the moon their sun; and I\nthought--Everything sleeps and dreams now: when the night comes, it will\nbe different. At the same time I, being a man and a child of the day,\nfelt some anxiety as to how I should fare among the elves and other\nchildren of the night who wake when mortals dream, and find their common\nlife in those wondrous hours that flow noiselessly over the moveless\ndeath-like forms of men and women and children, lying strewn and parted\nbeneath the weight of the heavy waves of night, which flow on and beat\nthem down, and hold them drowned and senseless, until the ebbtide comes,\nand the waves sink away, back into the ocean of the dark. But I took\ncourage and went on. Soon, however, I became again anxious, though from\nanother cause. I had eaten nothing that day, and for an hour past had\nbeen feeling the want of food. So I grew afraid lest I should find\nnothing to meet my human necessities in this strange place; but once\nmore I comforted myself with hope and went on.\n\nBefore noon, I fancied I saw a thin blue smoke rising amongst the stems\nof larger trees in front of me; and soon I came to an open spot of\nground in which stood a little cottage, so built that the stems of four\ngreat trees formed its corners, while their branches met and intertwined\nover its roof, heaping a great cloud of leaves over it, up towards the\nheavens. I wondered at finding a human dwelling in this neighbourhood;\nand yet it did not look altogether human, though sufficiently so to\nencourage me to expect to find some sort of food. Seeing no door, I went\nround to the other side, and there I found one, wide open. A woman sat\nbeside it, preparing some vegetables for dinner. This was homely and\ncomforting. As I came near, she looked up, and seeing me, showed no\nsurprise, but bent her head again over her work, and said in a low tone:\n\n“Did you see my daughter?”\n\n“I believe I did,” said I. “Can you give me something to eat, for I am\nvery hungry?” “With pleasure,” she replied, in the same tone; “but do\nnot say anything more, till you come into the house, for the Ash is\nwatching us.”\n\nHaving said this, she rose and led the way into the cottage; which, I\nnow saw, was built of the stems of small trees set closely together, and\nwas furnished with rough chairs and tables, from which even the bark had\nnot been removed. As soon as she had shut the door and set a chair--\n\n“You have fairy blood in you,” said she, looking hard at me.\n\n“How do you know that?”\n\n“You could not have got so far into this wood if it were not so; and I\nam trying to find out some trace of it in your countenance. I think I\nsee it.”\n\n“What do you see?”\n\n“Oh, never mind: I may be mistaken in that.”\n\n“But how then do you come to live here?”\n\n“Because I too have fairy blood in me.”\n\nHere I, in my turn, looked hard at her, and thought I could perceive,\nnotwithstanding the coarseness of her features, and especially the\nheaviness of her eyebrows, a something unusual--I could hardly call it\ngrace, and yet it was an expression that strangely contrasted with\nthe form of her features. I noticed too that her hands were delicately\nformed, though brown with work and exposure.\n\n“I should be ill,” she continued, “if I did not live on the borders of\nthe fairies’ country, and now and then eat of their food. And I see by\nyour eyes that you are not quite free of the same need; though, from\nyour education and the activity of your mind, you have felt it less than\nI. You may be further removed too from the fairy race.”\n\nI remembered what the lady had said about my grandmothers.\n\nHere she placed some bread and some milk before me, with a kindly\napology for the homeliness of the fare, with which, however, I was in no\nhumour to quarrel. I now thought it time to try to get some explanation\nof the strange words both of her daughter and herself.\n\n“What did you mean by speaking so about the Ash?”\n\nShe rose and looked out of the little window. My eyes followed her; but\nas the window was too small to allow anything to be seen from where I\nwas sitting, I rose and looked over her shoulder. I had just time to\nsee, across the open space, on the edge of the denser forest, a single\nlarge ash-tree, whose foliage showed bluish, amidst the truer green of\nthe other trees around it; when she pushed me back with an expression\nof impatience and terror, and then almost shut out the light from the\nwindow by setting up a large old book in it.\n\n“In general,” said she, recovering her composure, “there is no danger in\nthe daytime, for then he is sound asleep; but there is something unusual\ngoing on in the woods; there must be some solemnity among the fairies\nto-night, for all the trees are restless, and although they cannot come\nawake, they see and hear in their sleep.”\n\n“But what danger is to be dreaded from him?”\n\nInstead of answering the question, she went again to the window and\nlooked out, saying she feared the fairies would be interrupted by foul\nweather, for a storm was brewing in the west.\n\n“And the sooner it grows dark, the sooner the Ash will be awake,” added\nshe.\n\nI asked her how she knew that there was any unusual excitement in the\nwoods. She replied--\n\n“Besides the look of the trees, the dog there is unhappy; and the eyes\nand ears of the white rabbit are redder than usual, and he frisks about\nas if he expected some fun. If the cat were at home, she would have\nher back up; for the young fairies pull the sparks out of her tail with\nbramble thorns, and she knows when they are coming. So do I, in another\nway.”\n\n At this instant, a grey cat rushed in like a demon, and\ndisappeared in a hole in the wall.\n\n“There, I told you!” said the woman.\n\n “But what of the ash-tree?” said I, returning once more to the\nsubject. Here, however, the young woman, whom I had met in the morning,\nentered. A smile passed between the mother and daughter; and then the\nlatter began to help her mother in little household duties.\n\n“I should like to stay here till the evening,” I said; “and then go on\nmy journey, if you will allow me.”\n\n“You are welcome to do as you please; only it might be better to stay\nall night, than risk the dangers of the wood then. Where are you going?”\n\n“Nay, that I do not know,” I replied, “but I wish to see all that is to\nbe seen, and therefore I should like to start just at sundown.” “You are\na bold youth, if you have any idea of what you are daring; but a rash\none, if you know nothing about it; and, excuse me, you do not seem very\nwell informed about the country and its manners. However, no one comes\nhere but for some reason, either known to himself or to those who have\ncharge of him; so you shall do just as you wish.”\n\nAccordingly I sat down, and feeling rather tired, and disinclined for\nfurther talk, I asked leave to look at the old book which still screened\nthe window. The woman brought it to me directly, but not before taking\nanother look towards the forest, and then drawing a white blind over\nthe window. I sat down opposite to it by the table, on which I laid the\ngreat old volume, and read. It contained many wondrous tales of Fairy\nLand, and olden times, and the Knights of King Arthur’s table. I read\non and on, till the shades of the afternoon began to deepen; for in\nthe midst of the forest it gloomed earlier than in the open country. At\nlength I came to this passage--\n\n“Here it chanced, that upon their quest, Sir Galahad and Sir Percivale\nrencountered in the depths of a great forest. Now, Sir Galahad was dight\nall in harness of silver, clear and shining; the which is a delight\nto look upon, but full hasty to tarnish, and withouten the labour of a\nready squire, uneath to be kept fair and clean. And yet withouten squire\nor page, Sir Galahad’s armour shone like the moon. And he rode a great\nwhite mare, whose bases and other housings were black, but all besprent\nwith fair lilys of silver sheen. Whereas Sir Percivale bestrode a red\nhorse, with a tawny mane and tail; whose trappings were all to-smirched\nwith mud and mire; and his armour was wondrous rosty to behold, ne could\nhe by any art furbish it again; so that as the sun in his going down\nshone twixt the bare trunks of the trees, full upon the knights twain,\nthe one did seem all shining with light, and the other all to glow with\nruddy fire. Now it came about in this wise. For Sir Percivale, after his\nescape from the demon lady, whenas the cross on the handle of his sword\nsmote him to the heart, and he rove himself through the thigh, and\nescaped away, he came to a great wood; and, in nowise cured of his\nfault, yet bemoaning the same, the damosel of the alder tree encountered\nhim, right fair to see; and with her fair words and false countenance\nshe comforted him and beguiled him, until he followed her where she led\nhim to a---”\n\nHere a low hurried cry from my hostess caused me to look up from the\nbook, and I read no more.\n\n“Look there!” she said; “look at his fingers!”\n\nJust as I had been reading in the book, the setting sun was shining\nthrough a cleft in the clouds piled up in the west; and a shadow as of a\nlarge distorted hand, with thick knobs and humps on the fingers, so that\nit was much wider across the fingers than across the undivided part\nof the hand, passed slowly over the little blind, and then as slowly\nreturned in the opposite direction.\n\n“He is almost awake, mother; and greedier than usual to-night.”\n\n“Hush, child; you need not make him more angry with us than he is; for\nyou do not know how soon something may happen to oblige us to be in the\nforest after nightfall.”\n\n“But you are in the forest,” said I; “how is it that you are safe here?”\n\n“He dares not come nearer than he is now,” she replied; “for any of\nthose four oaks, at the corners of our cottage, would tear him to\npieces; they are our friends. But he stands there and makes awful faces\nat us sometimes, and stretches out his long arms and fingers, and tries\nto kill us with fright; for, indeed, that is his favourite way of doing.\nPray, keep out of his way to-night.”\n\n“Shall I be able to see these things?” said I.\n\n“That I cannot tell yet, not knowing how much of the fairy nature there\nis in you. But we shall soon see whether you can discern the fairies in\nmy little garden, and that will be some guide to us.”\n\n“Are the trees fairies too, as well as the flowers?” I asked.\n\n“They are of the same race,” she replied; “though those you call fairies\nin your country are chiefly the young children of the flower fairies.\nThey are very fond of having fun with the thick people, as they call\nyou; for, like most children, they like fun better than anything else.”\n\n“Why do you have flowers so near you then? Do they not annoy you?”\n\n“Oh, no, they are very amusing, with their mimicries of grown people,\nand mock solemnities. Sometimes they will act a whole play through\nbefore my eyes, with perfect composure and assurance, for they are not\nafraid of me. Only, as soon as they have done, they burst into peals\nof tiny laughter, as if it was such a joke to have been serious over\nanything. These I speak of, however, are the fairies of the garden.\nThey are more staid and educated than those of the fields and woods.\nOf course they have near relations amongst the wild flowers, but they\npatronise them, and treat them as country cousins, who know nothing\nof life, and very little of manners. Now and then, however, they are\ncompelled to envy the grace and simplicity of the natural flowers.”\n\n“Do they live IN the flowers?” I said.\n\n“I cannot tell,” she replied. “There is something in it I do not\nunderstand. Sometimes they disappear altogether, even from me, though\nI know they are near. They seem to die always with the flowers they\nresemble, and by whose names they are called; but whether they return to\nlife with the fresh flowers, or, whether it be new flowers, new fairies,\nI cannot tell. They have as many sorts of dispositions as men and women,\nwhile their moods are yet more variable; twenty different expressions\nwill cross their little faces in half a minute. I often amuse myself\nwith watching them, but I have never been able to make personal\nacquaintance with any of them. If I speak to one, he or she looks up in\nmy face, as if I were not worth heeding, gives a little laugh, and runs\naway.” Here the woman started, as if suddenly recollecting herself, and\nsaid in a low voice to her daughter, “Make haste--go and watch him, and\nsee in what direction he goes.”\n\nI may as well mention here, that the conclusion I arrived at from the\nobservations I was afterwards able to make, was, that the flowers die\nbecause the fairies go away; not that the fairies disappear because\nthe flowers die. The flowers seem a sort of houses for them, or outer\nbodies, which they can put on or off when they please. Just as you could\nform some idea of the nature of a man from the kind of house he built,\nif he followed his own taste, so you could, without seeing the fairies,\ntell what any one of them is like, by looking at the flower till you\nfeel that you understand it. For just what the flower says to you, would\nthe face and form of the fairy say; only so much more plainly as a face\nand human figure can express more than a flower. For the house or the\nclothes, though like the inhabitant or the wearer, cannot be wrought\ninto an equal power of utterance. Yet you would see a strange\nresemblance, almost oneness, between the flower and the fairy, which you\ncould not describe, but which described itself to you. Whether all the\nflowers have fairies, I cannot determine, any more than I can be sure\nwhether all men and women have souls.\n\nThe woman and I continued the conversation for a few minutes longer. I\nwas much interested by the information she gave me, and astonished\nat the language in which she was able to convey it. It seemed that\nintercourse with the fairies was no bad education in itself. But now the\ndaughter returned with the news, that the Ash had just gone away in a\nsouth-westerly direction; and, as my course seemed to lie eastward, she\nhoped I should be in no danger of meeting him if I departed at once.\nI looked out of the little window, and there stood the ash-tree, to my\neyes the same as before; but I believed that they knew better than I\ndid, and prepared to go. I pulled out my purse, but to my dismay there\nwas nothing in it. The woman with a smile begged me not to trouble\nmyself, for money was not of the slightest use there; and as I might\nmeet with people in my journeys whom I could not recognise to be\nfairies, it was well I had no money to offer, for nothing offended them\nso much.\n\n“They would think,” she added, “that you were making game of them; and\nthat is their peculiar privilege with regard to us.” So we went together\ninto the little garden which sloped down towards a lower part of the\nwood.\n\nHere, to my great pleasure, all was life and bustle. There was still\nlight enough from the day to see a little; and the pale half-moon,\nhalfway to the zenith, was reviving every moment. The whole garden\nwas like a carnival, with tiny, gaily decorated forms, in groups,\nassemblies, processions, pairs or trios, moving stately on, running\nabout wildly, or sauntering hither or thither. From the cups or bells of\ntall flowers, as from balconies, some looked down on the masses below,\nnow bursting with laughter, now grave as owls; but even in their deepest\nsolemnity, seeming only to be waiting for the arrival of the next laugh.\nSome were launched on a little marshy stream at the bottom, in boats\nchosen from the heaps of last year’s leaves that lay about, curled and\nwithered. These soon sank with them; whereupon they swam ashore and got\nothers. Those who took fresh rose-leaves for their boats floated the\nlongest; but for these they had to fight; for the fairy of the rose-tree\ncomplained bitterly that they were stealing her clothes, and defended\nher property bravely.\n\n“You can’t wear half you’ve got,” said some.\n\n“Never you mind; I don’t choose you to have them: they are my property.”\n\n“All for the good of the community!” said one, and ran off with a great\nhollow leaf. But the rose-fairy sprang after him (what a beauty she was!\nonly too like a drawing-room young lady), knocked him heels-over-head as\nhe ran, and recovered her great red leaf. But in the meantime twenty had\nhurried off in different directions with others just as good; and the\nlittle creature sat down and cried, and then, in a pet, sent a perfect\npink snowstorm of petals from her tree, leaping from branch to branch,\nand stamping and shaking and pulling. At last, after another good cry,\nshe chose the biggest she could find, and ran away laughing, to launch\nher boat amongst the rest.\n\nBut my attention was first and chiefly attracted by a group of fairies\nnear the cottage, who were talking together around what seemed a\nlast dying primrose. They talked singing, and their talk made a song,\nsomething like this:\n\n\n\n    “Sister Snowdrop died\n        Before we were born.”\n     “She came like a bride\n        In a snowy morn.”\n     “What’s a bride?”\n         “What is snow?\n    “Never tried.”\n         “Do not know.”\n     “Who told you about her?”\n         “Little Primrose there\n    Cannot do without her.”\n         “Oh, so sweetly fair!”\n     “Never fear,\n        She will come,\n    Primrose dear.”\n         “Is she dumb?”\n\n    “She’ll come by-and-by.”\n         “You will never see her.”\n     “She went home to dies,\n        “Till the new year.”\n     “Snowdrop!”  “‘Tis no good\n        To invite her.”\n     “Primrose is very rude,\n        “I will bite her.”\n\n    “Oh, you naughty Pocket!\n        “Look, she drops her head.”\n     “She deserved it, Rocket,\n        “And she was nearly dead.”\n     “To your hammock--off with you!”\n         “And swing alone.”\n     “No one will laugh with you.”\n         “No, not one.”\n\n    “Now let us moan.”\n         “And cover her o’er.”\n     “Primrose is gone.”\n         “All but the flower.”\n     “Here is a leaf.”\n         “Lay her upon it.”\n     “Follow in grief.”\n         “Pocket has done it.”\n\n    “Deeper, poor creature!\n        Winter may come.”\n     “He cannot reach her--\n        That is a hum.”\n     “She is buried, the beauty!”\n         “Now she is done.”\n     “That was the duty.”\n         “Now for the fun.”\n\n\nAnd with a wild laugh they sprang away, most of them towards the\ncottage. During the latter part of the song-talk, they had formed\nthemselves into a funeral procession, two of them bearing poor Primrose,\nwhose death Pocket had hastened by biting her stalk, upon one of her\nown great leaves. They bore her solemnly along some distance, and\nthen buried her under a tree. Although I say HER I saw nothing but\nthe withered primrose-flower on its long stalk. Pocket, who had been\nexpelled from the company by common consent, went sulkily away towards\nher hammock, for she was the fairy of the calceolaria, and looked rather\nwicked. When she reached its stem, she stopped and looked round. I could\nnot help speaking to her, for I stood near her. I said, “Pocket, how\ncould you be so naughty?”\n\n“I am never naughty,” she said, half-crossly, half-defiantly; “only if\nyou come near my hammock, I will bite you, and then you will go away.”\n\n“Why did you bite poor Primrose?”\n\n“Because she said we should never see Snowdrop; as if we were not good\nenough to look at her, and she was, the proud thing!--served her right!”\n\n“Oh, Pocket, Pocket,” said I; but by this time the party which had\ngone towards the house, rushed out again, shouting and screaming with\nlaughter. Half of them were on the cat’s back, and half held on by her\nfur and tail, or ran beside her; till, more coming to their help, the\nfurious cat was held fast; and they proceeded to pick the sparks out\nof her with thorns and pins, which they handled like harpoons. Indeed,\nthere were more instruments at work about her than there could have\nbeen sparks in her. One little fellow who held on hard by the tip of\nthe tail, with his feet planted on the ground at an angle of forty-five\ndegrees, helping to keep her fast, administered a continuous flow of\nadmonitions to Pussy.\n\n“Now, Pussy, be patient. You know quite well it is all for your good.\nYou cannot be comfortable with all those sparks in you; and, indeed, I\nam charitably disposed to believe” (here he became very pompous) “that\nthey are the cause of all your bad temper; so we must have them all out,\nevery one; else we shall be reduced to the painful necessity of cutting\nyour claws, and pulling out your eye-teeth. Quiet! Pussy, quiet!”\n\nBut with a perfect hurricane of feline curses, the poor animal broke\nloose, and dashed across the garden and through the hedge, faster than\neven the fairies could follow. “Never mind, never mind, we shall find\nher again; and by that time she will have laid in a fresh stock of\nsparks. Hooray!” And off they set, after some new mischief.\n\nBut I will not linger to enlarge on the amusing display of these\nfrolicsome creatures. Their manners and habits are now so well known to\nthe world, having been so often described by eyewitnesses, that it would\nbe only indulging self-conceit, to add my account in full to the rest.\nI cannot help wishing, however, that my readers could see them for\nthemselves. Especially do I desire that they should see the fairy of the\ndaisy; a little, chubby, round-eyed child, with such innocent trust in\nhis look! Even the most mischievous of the fairies would not tease him,\nalthough he did not belong to their set at all, but was quite a little\ncountry bumpkin. He wandered about alone, and looked at everything, with\nhis hands in his little pockets, and a white night-cap on, the darling!\nHe was not so beautiful as many other wild flowers I saw afterwards, but\nso dear and loving in his looks and little confident ways.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n        “When bale is att hyest, boote is nyest.”\n                                 Ballad of Sir Aldingar.\n\nBy this time, my hostess was quite anxious that I should be gone. So,\nwith warm thanks for their hospitality, I took my leave, and went my way\nthrough the little garden towards the forest. Some of the garden flowers\nhad wandered into the wood, and were growing here and there along\nthe path, but the trees soon became too thick and shadowy for them. I\nparticularly noticed some tall lilies, which grew on both sides of\nthe way, with large dazzlingly white flowers, set off by the universal\ngreen. It was now dark enough for me to see that every flower was\nshining with a light of its own. Indeed it was by this light that I\nsaw them, an internal, peculiar light, proceeding from each, and not\nreflected from a common source of light as in the daytime. This light\nsufficed only for the plant itself, and was not strong enough to cast\nany but the faintest shadows around it, or to illuminate any of the\nneighbouring objects with other than the faintest tinge of its own\nindividual hue. From the lilies above mentioned, from the campanulas,\nfrom the foxgloves, and every bell-shaped flower, curious little figures\nshot up their heads, peeped at me, and drew back. They seemed to inhabit\nthem, as snails their shells but I was sure some of them were intruders,\nand belonged to the gnomes or goblin-fairies, who inhabit the ground\nand earthy creeping plants. From the cups of Arum lilies, creatures with\ngreat heads and grotesque faces shot up like Jack-in-the-box, and made\ngrimaces at me; or rose slowly and slily over the edge of the cup,\nand spouted water at me, slipping suddenly back, like those little\nsoldier-crabs that inhabit the shells of sea-snails. Passing a row of\ntall thistles, I saw them crowded with little faces, which peeped every\none from behind its flower, and drew back as quickly; and I heard them\nsaying to each other, evidently intending me to hear, but the speaker\nalways hiding behind his tuft, when I looked in his direction, “Look at\nhim! Look at him! He has begun a story without a beginning, and it will\nnever have any end. He! he! he! Look at him!”\n\nBut as I went further into the wood, these sights and sounds became\nfewer, giving way to others of a different character. A little forest\nof wild hyacinths was alive with exquisite creatures, who stood nearly\nmotionless, with drooping necks, holding each by the stem of her flower,\nand swaying gently with it, whenever a low breath of wind swung the\ncrowded floral belfry. In like manner, though differing of course\nin form and meaning, stood a group of harebells, like little angels\nwaiting, ready, till they were wanted to go on some yet unknown message.\nIn darker nooks, by the mossy roots of the trees, or in little tufts\nof grass, each dwelling in a globe of its own green light, weaving a\nnetwork of grass and its shadows, glowed the glowworms.\n\nThey were just like the glowworms of our own land, for they are fairies\neverywhere; worms in the day, and glowworms at night, when their own can\nappear, and they can be themselves to others as well as themselves.\nBut they had their enemies here. For I saw great strong-armed beetles,\nhurrying about with most unwieldy haste, awkward as elephant-calves,\nlooking apparently for glowworms; for the moment a beetle espied one,\nthrough what to it was a forest of grass, or an underwood of moss, it\npounced upon it, and bore it away, in spite of its feeble resistance.\nWondering what their object could be, I watched one of the beetles,\nand then I discovered a thing I could not account for. But it is no use\ntrying to account for things in Fairy Land; and one who travels there\nsoon learns to forget the very idea of doing so, and takes everything as\nit comes; like a child, who, being in a chronic condition of wonder, is\nsurprised at nothing. What I saw was this. Everywhere, here and there\nover the ground, lay little, dark-looking lumps of something more like\nearth than anything else, and about the size of a chestnut. The beetles\nhunted in couples for these; and having found one, one of them stayed\nto watch it, while the other hurried to find a glowworm. By signals, I\npresume, between them, the latter soon found his companion again: they\nthen took the glowworm and held its luminous tail to the dark earthly\npellet; when lo, it shot up into the air like a sky-rocket, seldom,\nhowever, reaching the height of the highest tree. Just like a rocket\ntoo, it burst in the air, and fell in a shower of the most gorgeously\ncoloured sparks of every variety of hue; golden and red, and purple and\ngreen, and blue and rosy fires crossed and inter-crossed each other,\nbeneath the shadowy heads, and between the columnar stems of the forest\ntrees. They never used the same glowworm twice, I observed; but let him\ngo, apparently uninjured by the use they had made of him.\n\nIn other parts, the whole of the immediately surrounding foliage was\nilluminated by the interwoven dances in the air of splendidly coloured\nfire-flies, which sped hither and thither, turned, twisted, crossed, and\nrecrossed, entwining every complexity of intervolved motion. Here and\nthere, whole mighty trees glowed with an emitted phosphorescent light.\nYou could trace the very course of the great roots in the earth by the\nfaint light that came through; and every twig, and every vein on every\nleaf was a streak of pale fire.\n\nAll this time, as I went through the wood, I was haunted with the\nfeeling that other shapes, more like my own size and mien, were moving\nabout at a little distance on all sides of me. But as yet I could\ndiscern none of them, although the moon was high enough to send a great\nmany of her rays down between the trees, and these rays were unusually\nbright, and sight-giving, notwithstanding she was only a half-moon. I\nconstantly imagined, however, that forms were visible in all directions\nexcept that to which my gaze was turned; and that they only became\ninvisible, or resolved themselves into other woodland shapes, the moment\nmy looks were directed towards them. However this may have been, except\nfor this feeling of presence, the woods seemed utterly bare of anything\nlike human companionship, although my glance often fell on some object\nwhich I fancied to be a human form; for I soon found that I was quite\ndeceived; as, the moment I fixed my regard on it, it showed plainly that\nit was a bush, or a tree, or a rock.\n\nSoon a vague sense of discomfort possessed me. With variations of\nrelief, this gradually increased; as if some evil thing were wandering\nabout in my neighbourhood, sometimes nearer and sometimes further off,\nbut still approaching. The feeling continued and deepened, until all my\npleasure in the shows of various kinds that everywhere betokened the\npresence of the merry fairies vanished by degrees, and left me full\nof anxiety and fear, which I was unable to associate with any definite\nobject whatever. At length the thought crossed my mind with horror: “Can\nit be possible that the Ash is looking for me? or that, in his nightly\nwanderings, his path is gradually verging towards mine?” I comforted\nmyself, however, by remembering that he had started quite in another\ndirection; one that would lead him, if he kept it, far apart from me;\nespecially as, for the last two or three hours, I had been diligently\njourneying eastward. I kept on my way, therefore, striving by direct\neffort of the will against the encroaching fear; and to this end\noccupying my mind, as much as I could, with other thoughts. I was so far\nsuccessful that, although I was conscious, if I yielded for a moment, I\nshould be almost overwhelmed with horror, I was yet able to walk right\non for an hour or more. What I feared I could not tell. Indeed, I was\nleft in a state of the vaguest uncertainty as regarded the nature of my\nenemy, and knew not the mode or object of his attacks; for, somehow or\nother, none of my questions had succeeded in drawing a definite answer\nfrom the dame in the cottage. How then to defend myself I knew not; nor\neven by what sign I might with certainty recognise the presence of my\nfoe; for as yet this vague though powerful fear was all the indication\nof danger I had. To add to my distress, the clouds in the west had risen\nnearly to the top of the skies, and they and the moon were travelling\nslowly towards each other. Indeed, some of their advanced guard had\nalready met her, and she had begun to wade through a filmy vapour that\ngradually deepened.\n\nAt length she was for a moment almost entirely obscured. When she shone\nout again, with a brilliancy increased by the contrast, I saw plainly\non the path before me--from around which at this spot the trees receded,\nleaving a small space of green sward--the shadow of a large hand, with\nknotty joints and protuberances here and there. Especially I remarked,\neven in the midst of my fear, the bulbous points of the fingers. I\nlooked hurriedly all around, but could see nothing from which such\na shadow should fall. Now, however, that I had a direction, however\nundetermined, in which to project my apprehension, the very sense of\ndanger and need of action overcame that stifling which is the worst\nproperty of fear. I reflected in a moment, that if this were indeed a\nshadow, it was useless to look for the object that cast it in any other\ndirection than between the shadow and the moon. I looked, and peered,\nand intensified my vision, all to no purpose. I could see nothing of\nthat kind, not even an ash-tree in the neighbourhood. Still the shadow\nremained; not steady, but moving to and fro, and once I saw the fingers\nclose, and grind themselves close, like the claws of a wild animal, as\nif in uncontrollable longing for some anticipated prey. There seemed\nbut one mode left of discovering the substance of this shadow. I went\nforward boldly, though with an inward shudder which I would not heed, to\nthe spot where the shadow lay, threw myself on the ground, laid my head\nwithin the form of the hand, and turned my eyes towards the moon Good\nheavens! what did I see? I wonder that ever I arose, and that the very\nshadow of the hand did not hold me where I lay until fear had frozen my\nbrain. I saw the strangest figure; vague, shadowy, almost transparent,\nin the central parts, and gradually deepening in substance towards the\noutside, until it ended in extremities capable of casting such a shadow\nas fell from the hand, through the awful fingers of which I now saw the\nmoon. The hand was uplifted in the attitude of a paw about to strike\nits prey. But the face, which throbbed with fluctuating and pulsatory\nvisibility--not from changes in the light it reflected, but from changes\nin its own conditions of reflecting power, the alterations being from\nwithin, not from without--it was horrible. I do not know how to describe\nit. It caused a new sensation. Just as one cannot translate a horrible\nodour, or a ghastly pain, or a fearful sound, into words, so I cannot\ndescribe this new form of awful hideousness. I can only try to describe\nsomething that is not it, but seems somewhat parallel to it; or at least\nis suggested by it. It reminded me of what I had heard of vampires; for\nthe face resembled that of a corpse more than anything else I can\nthink of; especially when I can conceive such a face in motion, but\nnot suggesting any life as the source of the motion. The features were\nrather handsome than otherwise, except the mouth, which had scarcely a\ncurve in it. The lips were of equal thickness; but the thickness was\nnot at all remarkable, even although they looked slightly swollen. They\nseemed fixedly open, but were not wide apart. Of course I did not REMARK\nthese lineaments at the time: I was too horrified for that. I noted them\nafterwards, when the form returned on my inward sight with a vividness\ntoo intense to admit of my doubting the accuracy of the reflex. But the\nmost awful of the features were the eyes. These were alive, yet not with\nlife.\n\nThey seemed lighted up with an infinite greed. A gnawing voracity, which\ndevoured the devourer, seemed to be the indwelling and propelling power\nof the whole ghostly apparition. I lay for a few moments simply imbruted\nwith terror; when another cloud, obscuring the moon, delivered me from\nthe immediately paralysing effects of the presence to the vision of the\nobject of horror, while it added the force of imagination to the power\nof fear within me; inasmuch as, knowing far worse cause for apprehension\nthan before, I remained equally ignorant from what I had to defend\nmyself, or how to take any precautions: he might be upon me in the\ndarkness any moment. I sprang to my feet, and sped I knew not whither,\nonly away from the spectre. I thought no longer of the path, and often\nnarrowly escaped dashing myself against a tree, in my headlong flight of\nfear.\n\nGreat drops of rain began to patter on the leaves. Thunder began to\nmutter, then growl in the distance. I ran on. The rain fell heavier. At\nlength the thick leaves could hold it up no longer; and, like a second\nfirmament, they poured their torrents on the earth. I was soon drenched,\nbut that was nothing. I came to a small swollen stream that rushed\nthrough the woods. I had a vague hope that if I crossed this stream, I\nshould be in safety from my pursuer; but I soon found that my hope was\nas false as it was vague. I dashed across the stream, ascended a rising\nground, and reached a more open space, where stood only great trees.\nThrough them I directed my way, holding eastward as nearly as I could\nguess, but not at all certain that I was not moving in an opposite\ndirection. My mind was just reviving a little from its extreme terror,\nwhen, suddenly, a flash of lightning, or rather a cataract of successive\nflashes, behind me, seemed to throw on the ground in front of me, but\nfar more faintly than before, from the extent of the source of the\nlight, the shadow of the same horrible hand. I sprang forward, stung\nto yet wilder speed; but had not run many steps before my foot slipped,\nand, vainly attempting to recover myself, I fell at the foot of one\nof the large trees. Half-stunned, I yet raised myself, and almost\ninvoluntarily looked back. All I saw was the hand within three feet\nof my face. But, at the same moment, I felt two large soft arms thrown\nround me from behind; and a voice like a woman’s said: “Do not fear the\ngoblin; he dares not hurt you now.” With that, the hand was suddenly\nwithdrawn as from a fire, and disappeared in the darkness and the rain.\nOvercome with the mingling of terror and joy, I lay for some time almost\ninsensible. The first thing I remember is the sound of a voice above me,\nfull and low, and strangely reminding me of the sound of a gentle wind\namidst the leaves of a great tree. It murmured over and over again:\n“I may love him, I may love him; for he is a man, and I am only a\nbeech-tree.” I found I was seated on the ground, leaning against a human\nform, and supported still by the arms around me, which I knew to be\nthose of a woman who must be rather above the human size, and largely\nproportioned. I turned my head, but without moving otherwise, for I\nfeared lest the arms should untwine themselves; and clear, somewhat\nmournful eyes met mine. At least that is how they impressed me; but I\ncould see very little of colour or outline as we sat in the dark and\nrainy shadow of the tree. The face seemed very lovely, and solemn from\nits stillness; with the aspect of one who is quite content, but waiting\nfor something. I saw my conjecture from her arms was correct: she was\nabove the human scale throughout, but not greatly.\n\n“Why do you call yourself a beech-tree?” I said.\n\n“Because I am one,” she replied, in the same low, musical, murmuring\nvoice.\n\n“You are a woman,” I returned.\n\n“Do you think so? Am I very like a woman then?”\n\n“You are a very beautiful woman. Is it possible you should not know it?”\n\n“I am very glad you think so. I fancy I feel like a woman sometimes. I\ndo so to-night--and always when the rain drips from my hair. For there\nis an old prophecy in our woods that one day we shall all be men and\nwomen like you. Do you know anything about it in your region? Shall I\nbe very happy when I am a woman? I fear not, for it is always in nights\nlike these that I feel like one. But I long to be a woman for all that.”\n\nI had let her talk on, for her voice was like a solution of all musical\nsounds. I now told her that I could hardly say whether women were happy\nor not. I knew one who had not been happy; and for my part, I had often\nlonged for Fairy Land, as she now longed for the world of men. But then\nneither of us had lived long, and perhaps people grew happier as they\ngrew older. Only I doubted it.\n\nI could not help sighing. She felt the sigh, for her arms were still\nround me. She asked me how old I was.\n\n“Twenty-one,” said I.\n\n“Why, you baby!” said she, and kissed me with the sweetest kiss of winds\nand odours. There was a cool faithfulness in the kiss that revived my\nheart wonderfully. I felt that I feared the dreadful Ash no more.\n\n“What did the horrible Ash want with me?” I said.\n\n“I am not quite sure, but I think he wants to bury you at the foot of\nhis tree. But he shall not touch you, my child.”\n\n“Are all the ash-trees as dreadful as he?”\n\n“Oh, no. They are all disagreeable selfish creatures--(what horrid men\nthey will make, if it be true!)--but this one has a hole in his heart\nthat nobody knows of but one or two; and he is always trying to fill it\nup, but he cannot. That must be what he wanted you for. I wonder if he\nwill ever be a man. If he is, I hope they will kill him.”\n\n“How kind of you to save me from him!”\n\n“I will take care that he shall not come near you again. But there are\nsome in the wood more like me, from whom, alas! I cannot protect you.\nOnly if you see any of them very beautiful, try to walk round them.”\n\n“What then?”\n\n“I cannot tell you more. But now I must tie some of my hair about you,\nand then the Ash will not touch you. Here, cut some off. You men have\nstrange cutting things about you.”\n\nShe shook her long hair loose over me, never moving her arms.\n\n“I cannot cut your beautiful hair. It would be a shame.”\n\n“Not cut my hair! It will have grown long enough before any is wanted\nagain in this wild forest. Perhaps it may never be of any use again--not\ntill I am a woman.” And she sighed.\n\nAs gently as I could, I cut with a knife a long tress of flowing, dark\nhair, she hanging her beautiful head over me. When I had finished, she\nshuddered and breathed deep, as one does when an acute pain, steadfastly\nendured without sign of suffering, is at length relaxed. She then took\nthe hair and tied it round me, singing a strange, sweet song, which I\ncould not understand, but which left in me a feeling like this--\n\n            “I saw thee ne’er before;\n             I see thee never more;\n             But love, and help, and pain, beautiful one,\n             Have made thee mine, till all my years are done.”\n\nI cannot put more of it into words. She closed her arms about me again,\nand went on singing. The rain in the leaves, and a light wind that had\narisen, kept her song company. I was wrapt in a trance of still delight.\nIt told me the secret of the woods, and the flowers, and the birds. At\none time I felt as if I was wandering in childhood through sunny spring\nforests, over carpets of primroses, anemones, and little white starry\nthings--I had almost said creatures, and finding new wonderful flowers\nat every turn. At another, I lay half dreaming in the hot summer noon,\nwith a book of old tales beside me, beneath a great beech; or, in\nautumn, grew sad because I trod on the leaves that had sheltered me,\nand received their last blessing in the sweet odours of decay; or, in\na winter evening, frozen still, looked up, as I went home to a warm\nfireside, through the netted boughs and twigs to the cold, snowy moon,\nwith her opal zone around her. At last I had fallen asleep; for I\nknow nothing more that passed till I found myself lying under a superb\nbeech-tree, in the clear light of the morning, just before sunrise.\nAround me was a girdle of fresh beech-leaves. Alas! I brought nothing\nwith me out of Fairy Land, but memories--memories. The great boughs of\nthe beech hung drooping around me. At my head rose its smooth stem, with\nits great sweeps of curving surface that swelled like undeveloped limbs.\nThe leaves and branches above kept on the song which had sung me asleep;\nonly now, to my mind, it sounded like a farewell and a speedwell. I sat\na long time, unwilling to go; but my unfinished story urged me on. I\nmust act and wander. With the sun well risen, I rose, and put my arms as\nfar as they would reach around the beech-tree, and kissed it, and said\ngood-bye. A trembling went through the leaves; a few of the last drops\nof the night’s rain fell from off them at my feet; and as I walked\nslowly away, I seemed to hear in a whisper once more the words: “I may\nlove him, I may love him; for he is a man, and I am only a beech-tree.”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n        “And she was smooth and full, as if one gush\n         Of life had washed her, or as if a sleep\n         Lay on her eyelid, easier to sweep\n         Than bee from daisy.”\n                                 BEDDOIS’ Pygmalion.\n\n        “Sche was as whyt as lylye yn May,\n         Or snow that sneweth yn wynterys day.”\n                              Romance of Sir Launfal.\n\n\nI walked on, in the fresh morning air, as if new-born. The only thing\nthat damped my pleasure was a cloud of something between sorrow and\ndelight that crossed my mind with the frequently returning thought of my\nlast night’s hostess. “But then,” thought I, “if she is sorry, I could\nnot help it; and she has all the pleasures she ever had. Such a day as\nthis is surely a joy to her, as much at least as to me. And her life\nwill perhaps be the richer, for holding now within it the memory of what\ncame, but could not stay. And if ever she is a woman, who knows but\nwe may meet somewhere? there is plenty of room for meeting in the\nuniverse.” Comforting myself thus, yet with a vague compunction, as if\nI ought not to have left her, I went on. There was little to distinguish\nthe woods to-day from those of my own land; except that all the wild\nthings, rabbits, birds, squirrels, mice, and the numberless other\ninhabitants, were very tame; that is, they did not run away from me, but\ngazed at me as I passed, frequently coming nearer, as if to examine\nme more closely. Whether this came from utter ignorance, or from\nfamiliarity with the human appearance of beings who never hurt them, I\ncould not tell. As I stood once, looking up to the splendid flower of\na parasite, which hung from the branch of a tree over my head, a large\nwhite rabbit cantered slowly up, put one of its little feet on one of\nmine, and looked up at me with its red eyes, just as I had been\nlooking up at the flower above me. I stooped and stroked it; but when\nI attempted to lift it, it banged the ground with its hind feet and\nscampered off at a great rate, turning, however, to look at me several\ntimes before I lost sight of it. Now and then, too, a dim human figure\nwould appear and disappear, at some distance, amongst the trees, moving\nlike a sleep-walker. But no one ever came near me.\n\nThis day I found plenty of food in the forest--strange nuts and fruits\nI had never seen before. I hesitated to eat them; but argued that, if\nI could live on the air of Fairy Land, I could live on its food also. I\nfound my reasoning correct, and the result was better than I had hoped;\nfor it not only satisfied my hunger, but operated in such a way upon my\nsenses that I was brought into far more complete relationship with the\nthings around me. The human forms appeared much more dense and defined;\nmore tangibly visible, if I may say so. I seemed to know better which\ndirection to choose when any doubt arose. I began to feel in some degree\nwhat the birds meant in their songs, though I could not express it in\nwords, any more than you can some landscapes. At times, to my surprise,\nI found myself listening attentively, and as if it were no unusual\nthing with me, to a conversation between two squirrels or monkeys.\nThe subjects were not very interesting, except as associated with the\nindividual life and necessities of the little creatures: where the best\nnuts were to be found in the neighbourhood, and who could crack them\nbest, or who had most laid up for the winter, and such like; only they\nnever said where the store was. There was no great difference in kind\nbetween their talk and our ordinary human conversation. Some of the\ncreatures I never heard speak at all, and believe they never do so,\nexcept under the impulse of some great excitement. The mice talked; but\nthe hedgehogs seemed very phlegmatic; and though I met a couple of moles\nabove ground several times, they never said a word to each other in my\nhearing. There were no wild beasts in the forest; at least, I did not\nsee one larger than a wild cat. There were plenty of snakes, however,\nand I do not think they were all harmless; but none ever bit me.\n\nSoon after mid-day I arrived at a bare rocky hill, of no great size, but\nvery steep; and having no trees--scarcely even a bush--upon it, entirely\nexposed to the heat of the sun. Over this my way seemed to lie, and\nI immediately began the ascent. On reaching the top, hot and weary, I\nlooked around me, and saw that the forest still stretched as far as the\nsight could reach on every side of me. I observed that the trees, in the\ndirection in which I was about to descend, did not come so near the\nfoot of the hill as on the other side, and was especially regretting the\nunexpected postponement of shelter, because this side of the hill seemed\nmore difficult to descend than the other had been to climb, when my eye\ncaught the appearance of a natural path, winding down through broken\nrocks and along the course of a tiny stream, which I hoped would lead\nme more easily to the foot. I tried it, and found the descent not at all\nlaborious; nevertheless, when I reached the bottom, I was very tired and\nexhausted with the heat. But just where the path seemed to end, rose\na great rock, quite overgrown with shrubs and creeping plants, some of\nthem in full and splendid blossom: these almost concealed an opening in\nthe rock, into which the path appeared to lead. I entered, thirsting for\nthe shade which it promised. What was my delight to find a rocky\ncell, all the angles rounded away with rich moss, and every ledge and\nprojection crowded with lovely ferns, the variety of whose forms, and\ngroupings, and shades wrought in me like a poem; for such a harmony\ncould not exist, except they all consented to some one end! A little\nwell of the clearest water filled a mossy hollow in one corner. I drank,\nand felt as if I knew what the elixir of life must be; then threw myself\non a mossy mound that lay like a couch along the inner end. Here I lay\nin a delicious reverie for some time; during which all lovely forms, and\ncolours, and sounds seemed to use my brain as a common hall, where they\ncould come and go, unbidden and unexcused. I had never imagined that\nsuch capacity for simple happiness lay in me, as was now awakened by\nthis assembly of forms and spiritual sensations, which yet were far too\nvague to admit of being translated into any shape common to my own and\nanother mind. I had lain for an hour, I should suppose, though it may\nhave been far longer, when, the harmonious tumult in my mind having\nsomewhat relaxed, I became aware that my eyes were fixed on a strange,\ntime-worn bas-relief on the rock opposite to me. This, after some\npondering, I concluded to represent Pygmalion, as he awaited the\nquickening of his statue. The sculptor sat more rigid than the figure to\nwhich his eyes were turned. That seemed about to step from its pedestal\nand embrace the man, who waited rather than expected.\n\n“A lovely story,” I said to myself. “This cave, now, with the bushes cut\naway from the entrance to let the light in, might be such a place as he\nwould choose, withdrawn from the notice of men, to set up his block of\nmarble, and mould into a visible body the thought already clothed with\nform in the unseen hall of the sculptor’s brain. And, indeed, if I\nmistake not,” I said, starting up, as a sudden ray of light arrived\nat that moment through a crevice in the roof, and lighted up a small\nportion of the rock, bare of vegetation, “this very rock is marble,\nwhite enough and delicate enough for any statue, even if destined to\nbecome an ideal woman in the arms of the sculptor.”\n\nI took my knife and removed the moss from a part of the block on which\nI had been lying; when, to my surprise, I found it more like alabaster\nthan ordinary marble, and soft to the edge of the knife. In fact, it\nwas alabaster. By an inexplicable, though by no means unusual kind of\nimpulse, I went on removing the moss from the surface of the stone;\nand soon saw that it was polished, or at least smooth, throughout. I\ncontinued my labour; and after clearing a space of about a couple of\nsquare feet, I observed what caused me to prosecute the work with more\ninterest and care than before. For the ray of sunlight had now reached\nthe spot I had cleared, and under its lustre the alabaster revealed\nits usual slight transparency when polished, except where my knife had\nscratched the surface; and I observed that the transparency seemed to\nhave a definite limit, and to end upon an opaque body like the more\nsolid, white marble. I was careful to scratch no more. And first, a\nvague anticipation gave way to a startling sense of possibility; then,\nas I proceeded, one revelation after another produced the entrancing\nconviction, that under the crust of alabaster lay a dimly visible form\nin marble, but whether of man or woman I could not yet tell. I worked on\nas rapidly as the necessary care would permit; and when I had uncovered\nthe whole mass, and rising from my knees, had retreated a little way,\nso that the effect of the whole might fall on me, I saw before me\nwith sufficient plainness--though at the same time with considerable\nindistinctness, arising from the limited amount of light the place\nadmitted, as well as from the nature of the object itself--a block of\npure alabaster enclosing the form, apparently in marble, of a reposing\nwoman. She lay on one side, with her hand under her cheek, and her face\ntowards me; but her hair had fallen partly over her face, so that I\ncould not see the expression of the whole. What I did see appeared to\nme perfectly lovely; more near the face that had been born with me in\nmy soul, than anything I had seen before in nature or art. The actual\noutlines of the rest of the form were so indistinct, that the more than\nsemi-opacity of the alabaster seemed insufficient to account for\nthe fact; and I conjectured that a light robe added its obscurity.\nNumberless histories passed through my mind of change of substance from\nenchantment and other causes, and of imprisonments such as this before\nme. I thought of the Prince of the Enchanted City, half marble and half\na man; of Ariel; of Niobe; of the Sleeping Beauty in the Wood; of the\nbleeding trees; and many other histories. Even my adventure of the\npreceding evening with the lady of the beech-tree contributed to arouse\nthe wild hope, that by some means life might be given to this form also,\nand that, breaking from her alabaster tomb, she might glorify my eyes\nwith her presence. “For,” I argued, “who can tell but this cave may be\nthe home of Marble, and this, essential Marble--that spirit of marble\nwhich, present throughout, makes it capable of being moulded into any\nform? Then if she should awake! But how to awake her? A kiss awoke\nthe Sleeping Beauty! a kiss cannot reach her through the incrusting\nalabaster.” I kneeled, however, and kissed the pale coffin; but she\nslept on. I bethought me of Orpheus, and the following stones--that\ntrees should follow his music seemed nothing surprising now. Might not a\nsong awake this form, that the glory of motion might for a time displace\nthe loveliness of rest? Sweet sounds can go where kisses may not enter.\nI sat and thought. Now, although always delighting in music, I had never\nbeen gifted with the power of song, until I entered the fairy forest. I\nhad a voice, and I had a true sense of sound; but when I tried to sing,\nthe one would not content the other, and so I remained silent. This\nmorning, however, I had found myself, ere I was aware, rejoicing in a\nsong; but whether it was before or after I had eaten of the fruits\nof the forest, I could not satisfy myself. I concluded it was after,\nhowever; and that the increased impulse to sing I now felt, was in part\nowing to having drunk of the little well, which shone like a brilliant\neye in a corner of the cave. I sat down on the ground by the “antenatal\ntomb,” leaned upon it with my face towards the head of the figure\nwithin, and sang--the words and tones coming together, and inseparably\nconnected, as if word and tone formed one thing; or, as if each word\ncould be uttered only in that tone, and was incapable of distinction\nfrom it, except in idea, by an acute analysis. I sang something like\nthis: but the words are only a dull representation of a state whose\nvery elevation precluded the possibility of remembrance; and in which I\npresume the words really employed were as far above these, as that state\ntranscended this wherein I recall it:\n\n            “Marble woman, vainly sleeping\n             In the very death of dreams!\n             Wilt thou--slumber from thee sweeping,\n             All but what with vision teems--\n             Hear my voice come through the golden\n             Mist of memory and hope;\n             And with shadowy smile embolden\n             Me with primal Death to cope?\n\n            “Thee the sculptors all pursuing,\n             Have embodied but their own;\n             Round their visions, form enduring,\n             Marble vestments thou hast thrown;\n             But thyself, in silence winding,\n             Thou hast kept eternally;\n             Thee they found not, many finding--\n             I have found thee: wake for me.”\n\n\nAs I sang, I looked earnestly at the face so vaguely revealed before me.\nI fancied, yet believed it to be but fancy, that through the dim veil\nof the alabaster, I saw a motion of the head as if caused by a sinking\nsigh. I gazed more earnestly, and concluded that it was but fancy.\nNeverthless I could not help singing again--\n\n            “Rest is now filled full of beauty,\n             And can give thee up, I ween;\n             Come thou forth, for other duty\n             Motion pineth for her queen.\n\n            “Or, if needing years to wake thee\n             From thy slumbrous solitudes,\n             Come, sleep-walking, and betake thee\n             To the friendly, sleeping woods.\n\n             Sweeter dreams are in the forest,\n             Round thee storms would never rave;\n             And when need of rest is sorest,\n             Glide thou then into thy cave.\n\n            “Or, if still thou choosest rather\n             Marble, be its spell on me;\n             Let thy slumber round me gather,\n             Let another dream with thee!”\n\n\nAgain I paused, and gazed through the stony shroud, as if, by very force\nof penetrative sight, I would clear every lineament of the lovely face.\nAnd now I thought the hand that had lain under the cheek, had slipped\na little downward. But then I could not be sure that I had at first\nobserved its position accurately. So I sang again; for the longing had\ngrown into a passionate need of seeing her alive--\n\n            “Or art thou Death, O woman? for since I\n                Have set me singing by thy side,\n             Life hath forsook the upper sky,\n                And all the outer world hath died.\n\n            “Yea, I am dead; for thou hast drawn\n                My life all downward unto thee.\n             Dead moon of love! let twilight dawn:\n                Awake! and let the darkness flee.\n\n            “Cold lady of the lovely stone!\n                Awake! or I shall perish here;\n             And thou be never more alone,\n                My form and I for ages near.\n\n            “But words are vain; reject them all--\n                They utter but a feeble part:\n             Hear thou the depths from which they call,\n                The voiceless longing of my heart.”\n\n\nThere arose a slightly crashing sound. Like a sudden apparition that\ncomes and is gone, a white form, veiled in a light robe of whiteness,\nburst upwards from the stone, stood, glided forth, and gleamed away\ntowards the woods. For I followed to the mouth of the cave, as soon\nas the amazement and concentration of delight permitted the nerves of\nmotion again to act; and saw the white form amidst the trees, as it\ncrossed a little glade on the edge of the forest where the sunlight fell\nfull, seeming to gather with intenser radiance on the one object that\nfloated rather than flitted through its lake of beams. I gazed after her\nin a kind of despair; found, freed, lost! It seemed useless to follow,\nyet follow I must. I marked the direction she took; and without once\nlooking round to the forsaken cave, I hastened towards the forest.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n     “Ah, let a man beware, when his wishes, fulfilled, rain down\n     upon him, and his happiness is unbounded.”\n\n     “Thy red lips, like worms,\n         Travel over my cheek.”\n                    --MOTHERWELL.\n\nBut as I crossed the space between the foot of the hill and the forest,\na vision of another kind delayed my steps. Through an opening to\nthe westward flowed, like a stream, the rays of the setting sun, and\noverflowed with a ruddy splendour the open space where I was. And riding\nas it were down this stream towards me, came a horseman in what appeared\nred armour. From frontlet to tail, the horse likewise shone red in the\nsunset. I felt as if I must have seen the knight before; but as he drew\nnear, I could recall no feature of his countenance. Ere he came up\nto me, however, I remembered the legend of Sir Percival in the rusty\narmour, which I had left unfinished in the old book in the cottage: it\nwas of Sir Percival that he reminded me. And no wonder; for when he came\nclose up to me, I saw that, from crest to heel, the whole surface of his\narmour was covered with a light rust. The golden spurs shone, but the\niron greaves glowed in the sunlight. The MORNING STAR, which hung from\nhis wrist, glittered and glowed with its silver and bronze. His whole\nappearance was terrible; but his face did not answer to this appearance.\nIt was sad, even to gloominess; and something of shame seemed to cover\nit. Yet it was noble and high, though thus beclouded; and the form\nlooked lofty, although the head drooped, and the whole frame was bowed\nas with an inward grief. The horse seemed to share in his master’s\ndejection, and walked spiritless and slow. I noticed, too, that the\nwhite plume on his helmet was discoloured and drooping. “He has fallen\nin a joust with spears,” I said to myself; “yet it becomes not a noble\nknight to be conquered in spirit because his body hath fallen.” He\nappeared not to observe me, for he was riding past without looking up,\nand started into a warlike attitude the moment the first sound of my\nvoice reached him. Then a flush, as of shame, covered all of his face\nthat the lifted beaver disclosed. He returned my greeting with distant\ncourtesy, and passed on. But suddenly, he reined up, sat a moment still,\nand then turning his horse, rode back to where I stood looking after\nhim.\n\n“I am ashamed,” he said, “to appear a knight, and in such a guise; but\nit behoves me to tell you to take warning from me, lest the same evil,\nin his kind, overtake the singer that has befallen the knight. Hast thou\never read the story of Sir Percival and the”--(here he shuddered, that\nhis armour rang)--“Maiden of the Alder-tree?”\n\n“In part, I have,” said I; “for yesterday, at the entrance of this\nforest, I found in a cottage the volume wherein it is recorded.” “Then\ntake heed,” he rejoined; “for, see my armour--I put it off; and as it\nbefell to him, so has it befallen to me. I that was proud am humble now.\nYet is she terribly beautiful--beware. Never,” he added, raising his\nhead, “shall this armour be furbished, but by the blows of knightly\nencounter, until the last speck has disappeared from every spot where\nthe battle-axe and sword of evil-doers, or noble foes, might fall; when\nI shall again lift my head, and say to my squire, ‘Do thy duty once\nmore, and make this armour shine.’”\n\nBefore I could inquire further, he had struck spurs into his horse and\ngalloped away, shrouded from my voice in the noise of his armour. For I\ncalled after him, anxious to know more about this fearful enchantress;\nbut in vain--he heard me not. “Yet,” I said to myself, “I have now\nbeen often warned; surely I shall be well on my guard; and I am fully\nresolved I shall not be ensnared by any beauty, however beautiful.\nDoubtless, some one man may escape, and I shall be he.” So I went on\ninto the wood, still hoping to find, in some one of its mysterious\nrecesses, my lost lady of the marble. The sunny afternoon died into\nthe loveliest twilight. Great bats began to flit about with their own\nnoiseless flight, seemingly purposeless, because its objects are unseen.\nThe monotonous music of the owl issued from all unexpected quarters in\nthe half-darkness around me. The glow-worm was alight here and there,\nburning out into the great universe. The night-hawk heightened all the\nharmony and stillness with his oft-recurring, discordant jar.\nNumberless unknown sounds came out of the unknown dusk; but all were of\ntwilight-kind, oppressing the heart as with a condensed atmosphere of\ndreamy undefined love and longing. The odours of night arose, and bathed\nme in that luxurious mournfulness peculiar to them, as if the plants\nwhence they floated had been watered with bygone tears. Earth drew me\ntowards her bosom; I felt as if I could fall down and kiss her. I forgot\nI was in Fairy Land, and seemed to be walking in a perfect night of\nour own old nursing earth. Great stems rose about me, uplifting a thick\nmultitudinous roof above me of branches, and twigs, and leaves--the bird\nand insect world uplifted over mine, with its own landscapes, its own\nthickets, and paths, and glades, and dwellings; its own bird-ways and\ninsect-delights. Great boughs crossed my path; great roots based the\ntree-columns, and mightily clasped the earth, strong to lift and strong\nto uphold. It seemed an old, old forest, perfect in forest ways and\npleasures. And when, in the midst of this ecstacy, I remembered that\nunder some close canopy of leaves, by some giant stem, or in some mossy\ncave, or beside some leafy well, sat the lady of the marble, whom my\nsongs had called forth into the outer world, waiting (might it not\nbe?) to meet and thank her deliverer in a twilight which would veil her\nconfusion, the whole night became one dream-realm of joy, the central\nform of which was everywhere present, although unbeheld. Then,\nremembering how my songs seemed to have called her from the marble,\npiercing through the pearly shroud of alabaster--“Why,” thought I,\n“should not my voice reach her now, through the ebon night that\ninwraps her.” My voice burst into song so spontaneously that it seemed\ninvoluntarily.\n\n            “Not a sound\n             But, echoing in me,\n             Vibrates all around\n             With a blind delight,\n             Till it breaks on Thee,\n             Queen of Night!\n\n             Every tree,\n             O’ershadowing with gloom,\n             Seems to cover thee\n             Secret, dark, love-still’d,\n             In a holy room\n             Silence-filled.\n\n            “Let no moon\n             Creep up the heaven to-night;\n             I in darksome noon\n             Walking hopefully,\n             Seek my shrouded light--\n             Grope for thee!\n\n            “Darker grow\n             The borders of the dark!\n             Through the branches glow,\n             From the roof above,\n             Star and diamond-sparks\n             Light for love.”\n\n\nScarcely had the last sounds floated away from the hearing of my own\nears, when I heard instead a low delicious laugh near me. It was not the\nlaugh of one who would not be heard, but the laugh of one who has just\nreceived something long and patiently desired--a laugh that ends in\na low musical moan. I started, and, turning sideways, saw a dim white\nfigure seated beside an intertwining thicket of smaller trees and\nunderwood.\n\n“It is my white lady!” I said, and flung myself on the ground beside\nher; striving, through the gathering darkness, to get a glimpse of the\nform which had broken its marble prison at my call.\n\n“It is your white lady!” said the sweetest voice, in reply, sending a\nthrill of speechless delight through a heart which all the love-charms\nof the preceding day and evening had been tempering for this culminating\nhour. Yet, if I would have confessed it, there was something either in\nthe sound of the voice, although it seemed sweetness itself, or else in\nthis yielding which awaited no gradation of gentle approaches, that did\nnot vibrate harmoniously with the beat of my inward music. And likewise,\nwhen, taking her hand in mine, I drew closer to her, looking for the\nbeauty of her face, which, indeed, I found too plenteously, a cold\nshiver ran through me; but “it is the marble,” I said to myself, and\nheeded it not.\n\nShe withdrew her hand from mine, and after that would scarce allow me to\ntouch her. It seemed strange, after the fulness of her first greeting,\nthat she could not trust me to come close to her. Though her words\nwere those of a lover, she kept herself withdrawn as if a mile of space\ninterposed between us.\n\n“Why did you run away from me when you woke in the cave?” I said.\n\n“Did I?” she returned. “That was very unkind of me; but I did not know\nbetter.”\n\n“I wish I could see you. The night is very dark.”\n\n“So it is. Come to my grotto. There is light there.”\n\n“Have you another cave, then?”\n\n“Come and see.”\n\nBut she did not move until I rose first, and then she was on her feet\nbefore I could offer my hand to help her. She came close to my side, and\nconducted me through the wood. But once or twice, when, involuntarily\nalmost, I was about to put my arm around her as we walked on through the\nwarm gloom, she sprang away several paces, always keeping her face full\ntowards me, and then stood looking at me, slightly stooping, in the\nattitude of one who fears some half-seen enemy. It was too dark to\ndiscern the expression of her face. Then she would return and walk close\nbeside me again, as if nothing had happened. I thought this strange;\nbut, besides that I had almost, as I said before, given up the attempt\nto account for appearances in Fairy Land, I judged that it would be very\nunfair to expect from one who had slept so long and had been so suddenly\nawakened, a behaviour correspondent to what I might unreflectingly look\nfor. I knew not what she might have been dreaming about. Besides, it was\npossible that, while her words were free, her sense of touch might be\nexquisitely delicate.\n\nAt length, after walking a long way in the woods, we arrived at another\nthicket, through the intertexture of which was glimmering a pale rosy\nlight.\n\n “Push aside the branches,” she said, “and make room for us to\nenter.”\n\nI did as she told me.\n\n“Go in,” she said; “I will follow you.”\n\nI did as she desired, and found myself in a little cave, not very unlike\nthe marble cave. It was festooned and draperied with all kinds of\ngreen that cling to shady rocks. In the furthest corner, half-hidden in\nleaves, through which it glowed, mingling lovely shadows between them,\nburned a bright rosy flame on a little earthen lamp. The lady glided\nround by the wall from behind me, still keeping her face towards me, and\nseated herself in the furthest corner, with her back to the lamp, which\nshe hid completely from my view. I then saw indeed a form of perfect\nloveliness before me. Almost it seemed as if the light of the rose-lamp\nshone through her (for it could not be reflected from her); such a\ndelicate shade of pink seemed to shadow what in itself must be a marbly\nwhiteness of hue. I discovered afterwards, however, that there was one\nthing in it I did not like; which was, that the white part of the eye\nwas tinged with the same slight roseate hue as the rest of the form. It\nis strange that I cannot recall her features; but they, as well as her\nsomewhat girlish figure, left on me simply and only the impression of\nintense loveliness. I lay down at her feet, and gazed up into her face\nas I lay. She began, and told me a strange tale, which, likewise, I\ncannot recollect; but which, at every turn and every pause, somehow or\nother fixed my eyes and thoughts upon her extreme beauty; seeming always\nto culminate in something that had a relation, revealed or hidden, but\nalways operative, with her own loveliness. I lay entranced. It was a\ntale which brings back a feeling as of snows and tempests; torrents\nand water-sprites; lovers parted for long, and meeting at last; with a\ngorgeous summer night to close up the whole. I listened till she and I\nwere blended with the tale; till she and I were the whole history. And\nwe had met at last in this same cave of greenery, while the summer night\nhung round us heavy with love, and the odours that crept through the\nsilence from the sleeping woods were the only signs of an outer world\nthat invaded our solitude. What followed I cannot clearly remember. The\nsucceeding horror almost obliterated it. I woke as a grey dawn stole\ninto the cave. The damsel had disappeared; but in the shrubbery, at the\nmouth of the cave, stood a strange horrible object. It looked like an\nopen coffin set up on one end; only that the part for the head and\nneck was defined from the shoulder-part. In fact, it was a rough\nrepresentation of the human frame, only hollow, as if made of decaying\nbark torn from a tree.\n\nIt had arms, which were only slightly seamed, down from the\nshoulder-blade by the elbow, as if the bark had healed again from the\ncut of a knife. But the arms moved, and the hand and the fingers were\ntearing asunder a long silky tress of hair. The thing turned round--it\nhad for a face and front those of my enchantress, but now of a pale\ngreenish hue in the light of the morning, and with dead lustreless eyes.\nIn the horror of the moment, another fear invaded me. I put my hand to\nmy waist, and found indeed that my girdle of beech-leaves was gone.\nHair again in her hands, she was tearing it fiercely. Once more, as she\nturned, she laughed a low laugh, but now full of scorn and derision; and\nthen she said, as if to a companion with whom she had been talking while\nI slept, “There he is; you can take him now.” I lay still, petrified\nwith dismay and fear; for I now saw another figure beside her, which,\nalthough vague and indistinct, I yet recognised but too well. It was the\nAsh-tree. My beauty was the Maid of the Alder! and she was giving\nme, spoiled of my only availing defence, into the hands of my awful foe.\nThe Ash bent his Gorgon-head, and entered the cave. I could not stir.\nHe drew near me. His ghoul-eyes and his ghastly face fascinated me.\nHe came stooping, with the hideous hand outstretched, like a beast of\nprey. I had given myself up to a death of unfathomable horror, when,\nsuddenly, and just as he was on the point of seizing me, the dull,\nheavy blow of an axe echoed through the wood, followed by others in\nquick repetition. The Ash shuddered and groaned, withdrew the\noutstretched hand, retreated backwards to the mouth of the cave, then\nturned and disappeared amongst the trees. The other walking Death\nlooked at me once, with a careless dislike on her beautifully moulded\nfeatures; then, heedless any more to conceal her hollow deformity,\nturned her frightful back and likewise vanished amid the green\nobscurity without. I lay and wept. The Maid of the Alder-tree had\nbefooled me--nearly slain me--in spite of all the warnings I had\nreceived from those who knew my danger.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n         “Fight on, my men, Sir Andrew sayes,\n          A little I am hurt, but yett not slaine;\n          I’le but lye downe and bleede awhile,\n          And then I’le rise and fight againe.”\n                         Ballad of Sir Andrew Barton.\n\nBut I could not remain where I was any longer, though the daylight was\nhateful to me, and the thought of the great, innocent, bold sunrise\nunendurable. Here there was no well to cool my face, smarting with the\nbitterness of my own tears. Nor would I have washed in the well of\nthat grotto, had it flowed clear as the rivers of Paradise. I rose, and\nfeebly left the sepulchral cave. I took my way I knew not whither, but\nstill towards the sunrise. The birds were singing; but not for me. All\nthe creatures spoke a language of their own, with which I had nothing to\ndo, and to which I cared not to find the key any more.\n\nI walked listlessly along. What distressed me most--more even than my\nown folly--was the perplexing question, How can beauty and ugliness\ndwell so near? Even with her altered complexion and her face of dislike;\ndisenchanted of the belief that clung around her; known for a\nliving, walking sepulchre, faithless, deluding, traitorous; I felt\nnotwithstanding all this, that she was beautiful. Upon this I pondered\nwith undiminished perplexity, though not without some gain. Then I began\nto make surmises as to the mode of my deliverance; and concluded that\nsome hero, wandering in search of adventure, had heard how the forest\nwas infested; and, knowing it was useless to attack the evil thing in\nperson, had assailed with his battle-axe the body in which he dwelt, and\non which he was dependent for his power of mischief in the wood. “Very\nlikely,” I thought, “the repentant-knight, who warned me of the evil\nwhich has befallen me, was busy retrieving his lost honour, while I was\nsinking into the same sorrow with himself; and, hearing of the dangerous\nand mysterious being, arrived at his tree in time to save me from being\ndragged to its roots, and buried like carrion, to nourish him for\nyet deeper insatiableness.” I found afterwards that my conjecture was\ncorrect. I wondered how he had fared when his blows recalled the Ash\nhimself, and that too I learned afterwards.\n\nI walked on the whole day, with intervals of rest, but without food; for\nI could not have eaten, had any been offered me; till, in the afternoon,\nI seemed to approach the outskirts of the forest, and at length arrived\nat a farm-house. An unspeakable joy arose in my heart at beholding an\nabode of human beings once more, and I hastened up to the door, and\nknocked. A kind-looking, matronly woman, still handsome, made her\nappearance; who, as soon as she saw me, said kindly, “Ah, my poor boy,\nyou have come from the wood! Were you in it last night?”\n\nI should have ill endured, the day before, to be called BOY; but now the\nmotherly kindness of the word went to my heart; and, like a boy indeed,\nI burst into tears. She soothed me right gently; and, leading me into\na room, made me lie down on a settle, while she went to find me some\nrefreshment. She soon returned with food, but I could not eat. She\nalmost compelled me to swallow some wine, when I revived sufficiently to\nbe able to answer some of her questions. I told her the whole story.\n\n“It is just as I feared,” she said; “but you are now for the night\nbeyond the reach of any of these dreadful creatures. It is no wonder\nthey could delude a child like you. But I must beg you, when my husband\ncomes in, not to say a word about these things; for he thinks me even\nhalf crazy for believing anything of the sort. But I must believe my\nsenses, as he cannot believe beyond his, which give him no intimations\nof this kind. I think he could spend the whole of Midsummer-eve in\nthe wood and come back with the report that he saw nothing worse than\nhimself. Indeed, good man, he would hardly find anything better than\nhimself, if he had seven more senses given him.”\n\n“But tell me how it is that she could be so beautiful without any heart\nat all--without any place even for a heart to live in.”\n\n“I cannot quite tell,” she said; “but I am sure she would not look so\nbeautiful if she did not take means to make herself look more beautiful\nthan she is. And then, you know, you began by being in love with\nher before you saw her beauty, mistaking her for the lady of the\nmarble--another kind altogether, I should think. But the chief thing\nthat makes her beautiful is this: that, although she loves no man, she\nloves the love of any man; and when she finds one in her power, her\ndesire to bewitch him and gain his love (not for the sake of his love\neither, but that she may be conscious anew of her own beauty,\nthrough the admiration he manifests), makes her very lovely--with a\nself-destructive beauty, though; for it is that which is constantly\nwearing her away within, till, at last, the decay will reach her face,\nand her whole front, when all the lovely mask of nothing will fall to\npieces, and she be vanished for ever. So a wise man, whom she met in\nthe wood some years ago, and who, I think, for all his wisdom, fared no\nbetter than you, told me, when, like you, he spent the next night here,\nand recounted to me his adventures.”\n\nI thanked her very warmly for her solution, though it was but partial;\nwondering much that in her, as in woman I met on my first entering the\nforest, there should be such superiority to her apparent condition. Here\nshe left me to take some rest; though, indeed, I was too much agitated\nto rest in any other way than by simply ceasing to move.\n\nIn half an hour, I heard a heavy step approach and enter the house. A\njolly voice, whose slight huskiness appeared to proceed from overmuch\nlaughter, called out “Betsy, the pigs’ trough is quite empty, and that\nis a pity. Let them swill, lass! They’re of no use but to get fat. Ha!\nha! ha! Gluttony is not forbidden in their commandments. Ha! ha! ha!”\n The very voice, kind and jovial, seemed to disrobe the room of the\nstrange look which all new places wear--to disenchant it out of the\nrealm of the ideal into that of the actual. It began to look as if I\nhad known every corner of it for twenty years; and when, soon after, the\ndame came and fetched me to partake of their early supper, the grasp of\nhis great hand, and the harvest-moon of his benevolent face, which was\nneeded to light up the rotundity of the globe beneath it, produced such\na reaction in me, that, for a moment, I could hardly believe that there\nwas a Fairy Land; and that all I had passed through since I left home,\nhad not been the wandering dream of a diseased imagination, operating on\na too mobile frame, not merely causing me indeed to travel, but peopling\nfor me with vague phantoms the regions through which my actual steps\nhad led me. But the next moment my eye fell upon a little girl who was\nsitting in the chimney-corner, with a little book open on her knee, from\nwhich she had apparently just looked up to fix great inquiring eyes upon\nme. I believed in Fairy Land again. She went on with her reading, as\nsoon as she saw that I observed her looking at me. I went near, and\npeeping over her shoulder, saw that she was reading “The History of\nGraciosa and Percinet.”\n\n“Very improving book, sir,” remarked the old farmer, with a\ngood-humoured laugh. “We are in the very hottest corner of Fairy Land\nhere. Ha! ha! Stormy night, last night, sir.”\n\n“Was it, indeed?” I rejoined. “It was not so with me. A lovelier night I\nnever saw.” “Indeed! Where were you last night?”\n\n“I spent it in the forest. I had lost my way.”\n\n“Ah! then, perhaps, you will be able to convince my good woman, that\nthere is nothing very remarkable about the forest; for, to tell the\ntruth, it bears but a bad name in these parts. I dare say you saw\nnothing worse than yourself there?”\n\n“I hope I did,” was my inward reply; but, for an audible one, I\ncontented myself with saying, “Why, I certainly did see some appearances\nI could hardly account for; but that is nothing to be wondered at in an\nunknown wild forest, and with the uncertain light of the moon alone to\ngo by.”\n\n“Very true! you speak like a sensible man, sir. We have but few sensible\nfolks round about us. Now, you would hardly credit it, but my wife\nbelieves every fairy-tale that ever was written. I cannot account for\nit. She is a most sensible woman in everything else.”\n\n“But should not that make you treat her belief with something of\nrespect, though you cannot share in it yourself?”\n\n“Yes, that is all very well in theory; but when you come to live\nevery day in the midst of absurdity, it is far less easy to behave\nrespectfully to it. Why, my wife actually believes the story of the\n‘White Cat.’ You know it, I dare say.”\n\n“I read all these tales when a child, and know that one especially\nwell.”\n\n“But, father,” interposed the little girl in the chimney-corner, “you\nknow quite well that mother is descended from that very princess who was\nchanged by the wicked fairy into a white cat. Mother has told me so a\nmany times, and you ought to believe everything she says.”\n\n“I can easily believe that,” rejoined the farmer, with another fit of\nlaughter; “for, the other night, a mouse came gnawing and scratching\nbeneath the floor, and would not let us go to sleep. Your mother sprang\nout of bed, and going as near it as she could, mewed so infernally like\na great cat, that the noise ceased instantly. I believe the poor mouse\ndied of the fright, for we have never heard it again. Ha! ha! ha!”\n\nThe son, an ill-looking youth, who had entered during the conversation,\njoined in his father’s laugh; but his laugh was very different from the\nold man’s: it was polluted with a sneer. I watched him, and saw that,\nas soon as it was over, he looked scared, as if he dreaded some evil\nconsequences to follow his presumption. The woman stood near, waiting\ntill we should seat ourselves at the table, and listening to it all\nwith an amused air, which had something in it of the look with which one\nlistens to the sententious remarks of a pompous child. We sat down to\nsupper, and I ate heartily. My bygone distresses began already to look\nfar off.\n\n“In what direction are you going?” asked the old man.\n\n“Eastward,” I replied; nor could I have given a more definite answer.\n“Does the forest extend much further in that direction?”\n\n“Oh! for miles and miles; I do not know how far. For although I have\nlived on the borders of it all my life, I have been too busy to make\njourneys of discovery into it. Nor do I see what I could discover. It\nis only trees and trees, till one is sick of them. By the way, if you\nfollow the eastward track from here, you will pass close to what the\nchildren say is the very house of the ogre that Hop-o’-my-Thumb visited,\nand ate his little daughters with the crowns of gold.”\n\n“Oh, father! ate his little daughters! No; he only changed their gold\ncrowns for nightcaps; and the great long-toothed ogre killed them in\nmistake; but I do not think even he ate them, for you know they were his\nown little ogresses.”\n\n“Well, well, child; you know all about it a great deal better than I do.\nHowever, the house has, of course, in such a foolish neighbourhood as\nthis, a bad enough name; and I must confess there is a woman living\nin it, with teeth long enough, and white enough too, for the lineal\ndescendant of the greatest ogre that ever was made. I think you had\nbetter not go near her.”\n\nIn such talk as this the night wore on. When supper was finished, which\nlasted some time, my hostess conducted me to my chamber.\n\n“If you had not had enough of it already,” she said, “I would have put\nyou in another room, which looks towards the forest; and where you\nwould most likely have seen something more of its inhabitants. For they\nfrequently pass the window, and even enter the room sometimes. Strange\ncreatures spend whole nights in it, at certain seasons of the year. I am\nused to it, and do not mind it. No more does my little girl, who sleeps\nin it always. But this room looks southward towards the open country,\nand they never show themselves here; at least I never saw any.”\n\nI was somewhat sorry not to gather any experience that I might have, of\nthe inhabitants of Fairy Land; but the effect of the farmer’s company,\nand of my own later adventures, was such, that I chose rather an\nundisturbed night in my more human quarters; which, with their clean\nwhite curtains and white linen, were very inviting to my weariness.\n\nIn the morning I awoke refreshed, after a profound and dreamless sleep.\nThe sun was high, when I looked out of the window, shining over a wide,\nundulating, cultivated country. Various garden-vegetables were growing\nbeneath my window. Everything was radiant with clear sunlight. The\ndew-drops were sparkling their busiest; the cows in a near-by field were\neating as if they had not been at it all day yesterday; the maids were\nsinging at their work as they passed to and fro between the out-houses:\nI did not believe in Fairy Land. I went down, and found the family\nalready at breakfast. But before I entered the room where they sat, the\nlittle girl came to me, and looked up in my face, as though she wanted\nto say something to me. I stooped towards her; she put her arms round my\nneck, and her mouth to my ear, and whispered--\n\n“A white lady has been flitting about the house all night.”\n\n“No whispering behind doors!” cried the farmer; and we entered together.\n“Well, how have you slept? No bogies, eh?”\n\n“Not one, thank you; I slept uncommonly well.”\n\n“I am glad to hear it. Come and breakfast.”\n\nAfter breakfast, the farmer and his son went out; and I was left alone\nwith the mother and daughter.\n\n“When I looked out of the window this morning,” I said, “I felt almost\ncertain that Fairy Land was all a delusion of my brain; but whenever I\ncome near you or your little daughter, I feel differently. Yet I could\npersuade myself, after my last adventures, to go back, and have nothing\nmore to do with such strange beings.”\n\n“How will you go back?” said the woman.\n\n“Nay, that I do not know.”\n\n“Because I have heard, that, for those who enter Fairy Land, there is no\nway of going back. They must go on, and go through it. How, I do not in\nthe least know.”\n\n“That is quite the impression on my own mind. Something compels me to go\non, as if my only path was onward, but I feel less inclined this morning\nto continue my adventures.”\n\n“Will you come and see my little child’s room? She sleeps in the one I\ntold you of, looking towards the forest.”\n\n“Willingly,” I said.\n\nSo we went together, the little girl running before to open the door for\nus. It was a large room, full of old-fashioned furniture, that seemed to\nhave once belonged to some great house.\n\nThe window was built with a low arch, and filled with lozenge-shaped\npanes. The wall was very thick, and built of solid stone. I could see\nthat part of the house had been erected against the remains of some old\ncastle or abbey, or other great building; the fallen stones of which\nhad probably served to complete it. But as soon as I looked out of the\nwindow, a gush of wonderment and longing flowed over my soul like the\ntide of a great sea. Fairy Land lay before me, and drew me towards it\nwith an irresistible attraction. The trees bathed their great heads in\nthe waves of the morning, while their roots were planted deep in gloom;\nsave where on the borders the sunshine broke against their stems, or\nswept in long streams through their avenues, washing with brighter hue\nall the leaves over which it flowed; revealing the rich brown of the\ndecayed leaves and fallen pine-cones, and the delicate greens of the\nlong grasses and tiny forests of moss that covered the channel over\nwhich it passed in motionless rivers of light. I turned hurriedly to bid\nmy hostess farewell without further delay. She smiled at my haste, but\nwith an anxious look.\n\n“You had better not go near the house of the ogre, I think. My son will\nshow you into another path, which will join the first beyond it.”\n\nNot wishing to be headstrong or too confident any more, I agreed;\nand having taken leave of my kind entertainers, went into the wood,\naccompanied by the youth. He scarcely spoke as we went along; but he led\nme through the trees till we struck upon a path. He told me to follow\nit, and, with a muttered “good morning” left me.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n     “I am a part of the part, which at first was the whole.”\n      GOETHE.--Mephistopheles in Faust.\n\nMy spirits rose as I went deeper; into the forest; but I could not\nregain my former elasticity of mind. I found cheerfulness to be like\nlife itself--not to be created by any argument. Afterwards I learned,\nthat the best way to manage some kinds of pain filled thoughts, is to dare\nthem to do their worst; to let them lie and gnaw at your heart till they\nare tired; and you find you still have a residue of life they cannot\nkill. So, better and worse, I went on, till I came to a little clearing\nin the forest. In the middle of this clearing stood a long, low hut,\nbuilt with one end against a single tall cypress, which rose like a\nspire to the building. A vague misgiving crossed my mind when I saw it;\nbut I must needs go closer, and look through a little half-open door,\nnear the opposite end from the cypress. Window I saw none. On peeping\nin, and looking towards the further end, I saw a lamp burning, with\na dim, reddish flame, and the head of a woman, bent downwards, as if\nreading by its light. I could see nothing more for a few moments. At\nlength, as my eyes got used to the dimness of the place, I saw that the\npart of the rude building near me was used for household purposes;\nfor several rough utensils lay here and there, and a bed stood in the\ncorner.\n\nAn irresistible attraction caused me to enter. The woman never raised\nher face, the upper part of which alone I could see distinctly; but, as\nsoon as I stepped within the threshold, she began to read aloud, in a\nlow and not altogether unpleasing voice, from an ancient little volume\nwhich she held open with one hand on the table upon which stood the\nlamp. What she read was something like this:\n\n“So, then, as darkness had no beginning, neither will it ever have\nan end. So, then, is it eternal. The negation of aught else, is its\naffirmation. Where the light cannot come, there abideth the darkness.\nThe light doth but hollow a mine out of the infinite extension of the\ndarkness. And ever upon the steps of the light treadeth the darkness;\nyea, springeth in fountains and wells amidst it, from the secret\nchannels of its mighty sea. Truly, man is but a passing flame, moving\nunquietly amid the surrounding rest of night; without which he yet could\nnot be, and whereof he is in part compounded.”\n\nAs I drew nearer, and she read on, she moved a little to turn a leaf\nof the dark old volume, and I saw that her face was sallow and slightly\nforbidding. Her forehead was high, and her black eyes repressedly quiet.\nBut she took no notice of me. This end of the cottage, if cottage it\ncould be called, was destitute of furniture, except the table with the\nlamp, and the chair on which the woman sat. In one corner was a door,\napparently of a cupboard in the wall, but which might lead to a room\nbeyond. Still the irresistible desire which had made me enter the\nbuilding urged me: I must open that door, and see what was beyond it.\nI approached, and laid my hand on the rude latch. Then the woman spoke,\nbut without lifting her head or looking at me: “You had better not open\nthat door.” This was uttered quite quietly; and she went on with her\nreading, partly in silence, partly aloud; but both modes seemed equally\nintended for herself alone. The prohibition, however, only increased my\ndesire to see; and as she took no further notice, I gently opened the\ndoor to its full width, and looked in. At first, I saw nothing worthy\nof attention. It seemed a common closet, with shelves on each hand, on\nwhich stood various little necessaries for the humble uses of a cottage.\nIn one corner stood one or two brooms, in another a hatchet and other\ncommon tools; showing that it was in use every hour of the day for\nhousehold purposes. But, as I looked, I saw that there were no shelves\nat the back, and that an empty space went in further; its termination\nappearing to be a faintly glimmering wall or curtain, somewhat less,\nhowever, than the width and height of the doorway where I stood. But,\nas I continued looking, for a few seconds, towards this faintly luminous\nlimit, my eyes came into true relation with their object. All at once,\nwith such a shiver as when one is suddenly conscious of the presence of\nanother in a room where he has, for hours, considered himself alone, I\nsaw that the seemingly luminous extremity was a sky, as of night, beheld\nthrough the long perspective of a narrow, dark passage, through what, or\nbuilt of what, I could not tell. As I gazed, I clearly discerned two or\nthree stars glimmering faintly in the distant blue. But, suddenly, and\nas if it had been running fast from a far distance for this very point,\nand had turned the corner without abating its swiftness, a dark figure\nsped into and along the passage from the blue opening at the remote end.\nI started back and shuddered, but kept looking, for I could not help it.\nOn and on it came, with a speedy approach but delayed arrival; till, at\nlast, through the many gradations of approach, it seemed to come within\nthe sphere of myself, rushed up to me, and passed me into the cottage.\nAll I could tell of its appearance was, that it seemed to be a dark\nhuman figure. Its motion was entirely noiseless, and might be called a\ngliding, were it not that it appeared that of a runner, but with ghostly\nfeet. I had moved back yet a little to let him pass me, and looked round\nafter him instantly. I could not see him.\n\n“Where is he?” I said, in some alarm, to the woman, who still sat\nreading.\n\n“There, on the floor, behind you,” she said, pointing with her arm\nhalf-outstretched, but not lifting her eyes. I turned and looked, but\nsaw nothing. Then with a feeling that there was yet something behind me,\nI looked round over my shoulder; and there, on the ground, lay a black\nshadow, the size of a man. It was so dark, that I could see it in the\ndim light of the lamp, which shone full upon it, apparently without\nthinning at all the intensity of its hue.\n\n“I told you,” said the woman, “you had better not look into that\ncloset.”\n\n“What is it?” I said, with a growing sense of horror.\n\n“It is only your shadow that has found you,” she replied. “Everybody’s\nshadow is ranging up and down looking for him. I believe you call it by\na different name in your world: yours has found you, as every person’s\nis almost certain to do who looks into that closet, especially after\nmeeting one in the forest, whom I dare say you have met.”\n\nHere, for the first time, she lifted her head, and looked full at me:\nher mouth was full of long, white, shining teeth; and I knew that I was\nin the house of the ogre. I could not speak, but turned and left the\nhouse, with the shadow at my heels. “A nice sort of valet to have,” I\nsaid to myself bitterly, as I stepped into the sunshine, and, looking\nover my shoulder, saw that it lay yet blacker in the full blaze of the\nsunlight. Indeed, only when I stood between it and the sun, was the\nblackness at all diminished. I was so bewildered--stunned--both by the\nevent itself and its suddenness, that I could not at all realise to\nmyself what it would be to have such a constant and strange attendance;\nbut with a dim conviction that my present dislike would soon grow to\nloathing, I took my dreary way through the wood.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n        “O lady! we receive but what we give,\n         And in our life alone does nature live:\n         Ours is her wedding garments ours her shrorwd!\n                .  .  .  .  .\n         Ah! from the soul itself must issue forth,\n         A light, a glory, a fair luminous cloud,\n\n         Enveloping the Earth--\n         And from the soul itself must there be sent\n         A sweet and potent voice of its own birth,\n         Of all sweet sounds the life and element!”\n                                         COLERIDGE.\n\nFrom this time, until I arrived at the palace of Fairy Land, I can\nattempt no consecutive account of my wanderings and adventures.\nEverything, henceforward, existed for me in its relation to my\nattendant. What influence he exercised upon everything into contact with\nwhich I was brought, may be understood from a few detached instances. To\nbegin with this very day on which he first joined me: after I had walked\nheartlessly along for two or three hours, I was very weary, and lay\ndown to rest in a most delightful part of the forest, carpeted with wild\nflowers. I lay for half an hour in a dull repose, and then got up to\npursue my way. The flowers on the spot where I had lain were crushed to\nthe earth: but I saw that they would soon lift their heads and rejoice\nagain in the sun and air. Not so those on which my shadow had lain. The\nvery outline of it could be traced in the withered lifeless grass,\nand the scorched and shrivelled flowers which stood there, dead, and\nhopeless of any resurrection. I shuddered, and hastened away with sad\nforebodings.\n\nIn a few days, I had reason to dread an extension of its baleful\ninfluences from the fact, that it was no longer confined to one position\nin regard to myself. Hitherto, when seized with an irresistible desire\nto look on my evil demon (which longing would unaccountably seize me at\nany moment, returning at longer or shorter intervals, sometimes every\nminute), I had to turn my head backwards, and look over my shoulder; in\nwhich position, as long as I could retain it, I was fascinated. But one\nday, having come out on a clear grassy hill, which commanded a glorious\nprospect, though of what I cannot now tell, my shadow moved round, and\ncame in front of me. And, presently, a new manifestation increased\nmy distress. For it began to coruscate, and shoot out on all sides a\nradiation of dim shadow. These rays of gloom issued from the central\nshadow as from a black sun, lengthening and shortening with continual\nchange. But wherever a ray struck, that part of earth, or sea, or\nsky, became void, and desert, and sad to my heart. On this, the first\ndevelopment of its new power, one ray shot out beyond the rest, seeming\nto lengthen infinitely, until it smote the great sun on the face, which\nwithered and darkened beneath the blow. I turned away and went on. The\nshadow retreated to its former position; and when I looked again, it\nhad drawn in all its spears of darkness, and followed like a dog at my\nheels.\n\nOnce, as I passed by a cottage, there came out a lovely fairy child,\nwith two wondrous toys, one in each hand. The one was the tube through\nwhich the fairy-gifted poet looks when he beholds the same thing\neverywhere; the other that through which he looks when he combines into\nnew forms of loveliness those images of beauty which his own choice has\ngathered from all regions wherein he has travelled. Round the child’s\nhead was an aureole of emanating rays. As I looked at him in wonder and\ndelight, round crept from behind me the something dark, and the child\nstood in my shadow. Straightway he was a commonplace boy, with a rough\nbroad-brimmed straw hat, through which brim the sun shone from behind.\nThe toys he carried were a multiplying-glass and a kaleidoscope. I\nsighed and departed.\n\nOne evening, as a great silent flood of western gold flowed through an\navenue in the woods, down the stream, just as when I saw him first, came\nthe sad knight, riding on his chestnut steed.\n\nBut his armour did not shine half so red as when I saw him first.\n\nMany a blow of mighty sword and axe, turned aside by the strength of\nhis mail, and glancing adown the surface, had swept from its path the\nfretted rust, and the glorious steel had answered the kindly blow with\nthe thanks of returning light. These streaks and spots made his armour\nlook like the floor of a forest in the sunlight. His forehead was higher\nthan before, for the contracting wrinkles were nearly gone; and the\nsadness that remained on his face was the sadness of a dewy summer\ntwilight, not that of a frosty autumn morn. He, too, had met the\nAlder-maiden as I, but he had plunged into the torrent of mighty deeds,\nand the stain was nearly washed away. No shadow followed him. He had\nnot entered the dark house; he had not had time to open the closet door.\n“Will he ever look in?” I said to myself. “MUST his shadow find him some\nday?” But I could not answer my own questions.\n\nWe travelled together for two days, and I began to love him. It was\nplain that he suspected my story in some degree; and I saw him once or\ntwice looking curiously and anxiously at my attendant gloom, which all\nthis time had remained very obsequiously behind me; but I offered no\nexplanation, and he asked none. Shame at my neglect of his warning, and\na horror which shrunk from even alluding to its cause, kept me silent;\ntill, on the evening of the second day, some noble words from my\ncompanion roused all my heart; and I was at the point of falling on\nhis neck, and telling him the whole story; seeking, if not for\nhelpful advice, for of that I was hopeless, yet for the comfort of\nsympathy--when round slid the shadow and inwrapt my friend; and I could\nnot trust him.\n\nThe glory of his brow vanished; the light of his eye grew cold; and I\nheld my peace. The next morning we parted.\n\nBut the most dreadful thing of all was, that I now began to feel\nsomething like satisfaction in the presence of the shadow. I began to\nbe rather vain of my attendant, saying to myself, “In a land like this,\nwith so many illusions everywhere, I need his aid to disenchant the\nthings around me. He does away with all appearances, and shows me things\nin their true colour and form. And I am not one to be fooled with the\nvanities of the common crowd. I will not see beauty where there is\nnone. I will dare to behold things as they are. And if I live in a waste\ninstead of a paradise, I will live knowing where I live.” But of this\na certain exercise of his power which soon followed quite cured me,\nturning my feelings towards him once more into loathing and distrust. It\nwas thus:\n\nOne bright noon, a little maiden joined me, coming through the wood in\na direction at right angles to my path. She came along singing and\ndancing, happy as a child, though she seemed almost a woman. In her\nhands--now in one, now in another--she carried a small globe, bright and\nclear as the purest crystal. This seemed at once her plaything and her\ngreatest treasure. At one moment, you would have thought her utterly\ncareless of it, and at another, overwhelmed with anxiety for its safety.\nBut I believe she was taking care of it all the time, perhaps not least\nwhen least occupied about it. She stopped by me with a smile, and bade\nme good day with the sweetest voice. I felt a wonderful liking to the\nchild--for she produced on me more the impression of a child, though my\nunderstanding told me differently. We talked a little, and then walked\non together in the direction I had been pursuing. I asked her about the\nglobe she carried, but getting no definite answer, I held out my hand\nto take it. She drew back, and said, but smiling almost invitingly the\nwhile, “You must not touch it;”--then, after a moment’s pause--“Or if\nyou do, it must be very gently.” I touched it with a finger. A slight\nvibratory motion arose in it, accompanied, or perhaps manifested, by\na faint sweet sound. I touched it again, and the sound increased. I\ntouched it the third time: a tiny torrent of harmony rolled out of the\nlittle globe. She would not let me touch it any more.\n\nWe travelled on together all that day. She left me when twilight came\non; but next day, at noon, she met me as before, and again we travelled\ntill evening. The third day she came once more at noon, and we walked on\ntogether. Now, though we had talked about a great many things connected\nwith Fairy Land, and the life she had led hitherto, I had never been\nable to learn anything about the globe. This day, however, as we went\non, the shadow glided round and inwrapt the maiden. It could not change\nher. But my desire to know about the globe, which in his gloom began to\nwaver as with an inward light, and to shoot out flashes of many-coloured\nflame, grew irresistible. I put out both my hands and laid hold of it.\nIt began to sound as before. The sound rapidly increased, till it grew\na low tempest of harmony, and the globe trembled, and quivered, and\nthrobbed between my hands. I had not the heart to pull it away from the\nmaiden, though I held it in spite of her attempts to take it from me;\nyes, I shame to say, in spite of her prayers, and, at last, her tears.\nThe music went on growing in, intensity and complication of tones, and\nthe globe vibrated and heaved; till at last it burst in our hands, and\na black vapour broke upwards from out of it; then turned, as if blown\nsideways, and enveloped the maiden, hiding even the shadow in its\nblackness. She held fast the fragments, which I abandoned, and fled from\nme into the forest in the direction whence she had come, wailing like\na child, and crying, “You have broken my globe; my globe is broken--my\nglobe is broken!” I followed her, in the hope of comforting her; but\nhad not pursued her far, before a sudden cold gust of wind bowed the\ntree-tops above us, and swept through their stems around us; a great\ncloud overspread the day, and a fierce tempest came on, in which I lost\nsight of her. It lies heavy on my heart to this hour. At night, ere I\nfall asleep, often, whatever I may be thinking about, I suddenly hear\nher voice, crying out, “You have broken my globe; my globe is broken;\nah, my globe!”\n\nHere I will mention one more strange thing; but whether this peculiarity\nwas owing to my shadow at all, I am not able to assure myself. I came\nto a village, the inhabitants of which could not at first sight be\ndistinguished from the dwellers in our land. They rather avoided than\nsought my company, though they were very pleasant when I addressed them.\nBut at last I observed, that whenever I came within a certain distance\nof any one of them, which distance, however, varied with different\nindividuals, the whole appearance of the person began to change; and\nthis change increased in degree as I approached. When I receded to the\nformer distance, the former appearance was restored. The nature of the\nchange was grotesque, following no fixed rule. The nearest resemblance\nto it that I know, is the distortion produced in your countenance when\nyou look at it as reflected in a concave or convex surface--say, either\nside of a bright spoon. Of this phenomenon I first became aware in\nrather a ludicrous way. My host’s daughter was a very pleasant pretty\ngirl, who made herself more agreeable to me than most of those about me.\nFor some days my companion-shadow had been less obtrusive than usual;\nand such was the reaction of spirits occasioned by the simple mitigation\nof torment, that, although I had cause enough besides to be gloomy, I\nfelt light and comparatively happy. My impression is, that she was quite\naware of the law of appearances that existed between the people of the\nplace and myself, and had resolved to amuse herself at my expense; for\none evening, after some jesting and raillery, she, somehow or other,\nprovoked me to attempt to kiss her. But she was well defended from\nany assault of the kind. Her countenance became, of a sudden, absurdly\nhideous; the pretty mouth was elongated and otherwise amplified\nsufficiently to have allowed of six simultaneous kisses. I started back\nin bewildered dismay; she burst into the merriest fit of laughter, and\nran from the room. I soon found that the same undefinable law of change\noperated between me and all the other villagers; and that, to feel I was\nin pleasant company, it was absolutely necessary for me to discover and\nobserve the right focal distance between myself and each one with whom\nI had to do. This done, all went pleasantly enough. Whether, when I\nhappened to neglect this precaution, I presented to them an equally\nridiculous appearance, I did not ascertain; but I presume that the\nalteration was common to the approximating parties. I was likewise\nunable to determine whether I was a necessary party to the production of\nthis strange transformation, or whether it took place as well, under the\ngiven circumstances, between the inhabitants themselves.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n        “From Eden’s bowers the full-fed rivers flow,\n         To guide the outcasts to the land of woe:\n         Our Earth one little toiling streamlet yields.\n         To guide the wanderers to the happy fields.”\n\n After leaving this village, where I had rested for nearly a\nweek, I travelled through a desert region of dry sand and glittering\nrocks, peopled principally by goblin-fairies. When I first entered their\ndomains, and, indeed, whenever I fell in with another tribe of them,\nthey began mocking me with offered handfuls of gold and jewels, making\nhideous grimaces at me, and performing the most antic homage, as if they\nthought I expected reverence, and meant to humour me like a maniac. But\never, as soon as one cast his eyes on the shadow behind me, he made a\nwry face, partly of pity, partly of contempt, and looked ashamed, as\nif he had been caught doing something inhuman; then, throwing down his\nhandful of gold, and ceasing all his grimaces, he stood aside to let me\npass in peace, and made signs to his companions to do the like. I had no\ninclination to observe them much, for the shadow was in my heart as well\nas at my heels. I walked listlessly and almost hopelessly along, till I\narrived one day at a small spring; which, bursting cool from the heart\nof a sun-heated rock, flowed somewhat southwards from the direction I\nhad been taking. I drank of this spring, and found myself wonderfully\nrefreshed. A kind of love to the cheerful little stream arose in my\nheart. It was born in a desert; but it seemed to say to itself, “I will\nflow, and sing, and lave my banks, till I make my desert a paradise.”\n I thought I could not do better than follow it, and see what it made\nof it. So down with the stream I went, over rocky lands, burning with\nsunbeams. But the rivulet flowed not far, before a few blades of\ngrass appeared on its banks, and then, here and there, a stunted bush.\nSometimes it disappeared altogether under ground; and after I had\nwandered some distance, as near as I could guess, in the direction it\nseemed to take, I would suddenly hear it again, singing, sometimes far\naway to my right or left, amongst new rocks, over which it made new\ncataracts of watery melodies. The verdure on its banks increased as it\nflowed; other streams joined it; and at last, after many days’ travel,\nI found myself, one gorgeous summer evening, resting by the side of a\nbroad river, with a glorious horse-chestnut tree towering above me, and\ndropping its blossoms, milk-white and rosy-red, all about me. As I sat,\na gush of joy sprang forth in my heart, and over flowed at my eyes.\n\nThrough my tears, the whole landscape glimmered in such bewildering\nloveliness, that I felt as if I were entering Fairy Land for the first\ntime, and some loving hand were waiting to cool my head, and a loving\nword to warm my heart. Roses, wild roses, everywhere! So plentiful were\nthey, they not only perfumed the air, they seemed to dye it a faint\nrose-hue. The colour floated abroad with the scent, and clomb, and\nspread, until the whole west blushed and glowed with the gathered\nincense of roses. And my heart fainted with longing in my bosom.\n\nCould I but see the Spirit of the Earth, as I saw once the in dwelling\nwoman of the beech-tree, and my beauty of the pale marble, I should be\ncontent. Content!--Oh, how gladly would I die of the light of her eyes!\nYea, I would cease to be, if that would bring me one word of love from\nthe one mouth. The twilight sank around, and infolded me with sleep. I\nslept as I had not slept for months. I did not awake till late in the\nmorning; when, refreshed in body and mind, I rose as from the death that\nwipes out the sadness of life, and then dies itself in the new morrow.\nAgain I followed the stream; now climbing a steep rocky bank that hemmed\nit in; now wading through long grasses and wild flowers in its path; now\nthrough meadows; and anon through woods that crowded down to the very\nlip of the water.\n\nAt length, in a nook of the river, gloomy with the weight of overhanging\nfoliage, and still and deep as a soul in which the torrent eddies of\npain have hollowed a great gulf, and then, subsiding in violence, have\nleft it full of a motionless, fathomless sorrow--I saw a little boat\nlying. So still was the water here, that the boat needed no fastening.\nIt lay as if some one had just stepped ashore, and would in a moment\nreturn. But as there were no signs of presence, and no track through the\nthick bushes; and, moreover, as I was in Fairy Land where one does very\nmuch as he pleases, I forced my way to the brink, stepped into the boat,\npushed it, with the help of the tree-branches, out into the stream,\nlay down in the bottom, and let my boat and me float whither the stream\nwould carry us. I seemed to lose myself in the great flow of sky above\nme unbroken in its infinitude, except when now and then, coming nearer\nthe shore at a bend in the river, a tree would sweep its mighty head\nsilently above mine, and glide away back into the past, never more to\nfling its shadow over me. I fell asleep in this cradle, in which mother\nNature was rocking her weary child; and while I slept, the sun slept\nnot, but went round his arched way. When I awoke, he slept in the\nwaters, and I went on my silent path beneath a round silvery moon. And\na pale moon looked up from the floor of the great blue cave that lay in\nthe abysmal silence beneath.\n\nWhy are all reflections lovelier than what we call the reality?--not\nso grand or so strong, it may be, but always lovelier? Fair as is the\ngliding sloop on the shining sea, the wavering, trembling, unresting\nsail below is fairer still. Yea, the reflecting ocean itself, reflected\nin the mirror, has a wondrousness about its waters that somewhat\nvanishes when I turn towards itself. All mirrors are magic mirrors. The\ncommonest room is a room in a poem when I turn to the glass. (And this\nreminds me, while I write, of a strange story which I read in the fairy\npalace, and of which I will try to make a feeble memorial in its place.)\nIn whatever way it may be accounted for, of one thing we may be sure,\nthat this feeling is no cheat; for there is no cheating in nature and\nthe simple unsought feelings of the soul. There must be a truth involved\nin it, though we may but in part lay hold of the meaning. Even the\nmemories of past pain are beautiful; and past delights, though beheld\nonly through clefts in the grey clouds of sorrow, are lovely as Fairy\nLand. But how have I wandered into the deeper fairyland of the soul,\nwhile as yet I only float towards the fairy palace of Fairy Land! The\nmoon, which is the lovelier memory or reflex of the down-gone sun, the\njoyous day seen in the faint mirror of the brooding night, had rapt me\naway.\n\nI sat up in the boat. Gigantic forest trees were about me; through\nwhich, like a silver snake, twisted and twined the great river. The\nlittle waves, when I moved in the boat, heaved and fell with a plash\nas of molten silver, breaking the image of the moon into a thousand\nmorsels, fusing again into one, as the ripples of laughter die into the\nstill face of joy. The sleeping woods, in undefined massiveness; the\nwater that flowed in its sleep; and, above all, the enchantress moon,\nwhich had cast them all, with her pale eye, into the charmed slumber,\nsank into my soul, and I felt as if I had died in a dream, and should\nnever more awake.\n\nFrom this I was partly aroused by a glimmering of white, that, through\nthe trees on the left, vaguely crossed my vision, as I gazed upwards.\nBut the trees again hid the object; and at the moment, some strange\nmelodious bird took up its song, and sang, not an ordinary bird-song,\nwith constant repetitions of the same melody, but what sounded like\na continuous strain, in which one thought was expressed, deepening in\nintensity as evolved in progress. It sounded like a welcome already\novershadowed with the coming farewell. As in all sweetest music, a tinge\nof sadness was in every note. Nor do we know how much of the pleasures\neven of life we owe to the intermingled sorrows. Joy cannot unfold\nthe deepest truths, although deepest truth must be deepest joy. Cometh\nwhite-robed Sorrow, stooping and wan, and flingeth wide the doors she\nmay not enter. Almost we linger with Sorrow for very love.\n\nAs the song concluded the stream bore my little boat with a gentle sweep\nround a bend of the river; and lo! on a broad lawn, which rose from the\nwater’s edge with a long green slope to a clear elevation from which the\ntrees receded on all sides, stood a stately palace glimmering ghostly in\nthe moonshine: it seemed to be built throughout of the whitest marble.\nThere was no reflection of moonlight from windows--there seemed to be\nnone; so there was no cold glitter; only, as I said, a ghostly shimmer.\nNumberless shadows tempered the shine, from column and balcony and\ntower. For everywhere galleries ran along the face of the buildings;\nwings were extended in many directions; and numberless openings, through\nwhich the moonbeams vanished into the interior, and which served\nboth for doors and windows, had their separate balconies in front,\ncommunicating with a common gallery that rose on its own pillars.\nOf course, I did not discover all this from the river, and in the\nmoonlight. But, though I was there for many days, I did not succeed\nin mastering the inner topography of the building, so extensive and\ncomplicated was it.\n\nHere I wished to land, but the boat had no oars on board. However, I\nfound that a plank, serving for a seat, was unfastened, and with that I\nbrought the boat to the bank and scrambled on shore. Deep soft turf sank\nbeneath my feet, as I went up the ascent towards the palace.\n\nWhen I reached it, I saw that it stood on a great platform of marble,\nwith an ascent, by broad stairs of the same, all round it. Arrived on\nthe platform, I found there was an extensive outlook over the forest,\nwhich, however, was rather veiled than revealed by the moonlight.\n\nEntering by a wide gateway, but without gates, into an inner court,\nsurrounded on all sides by great marble pillars supporting galleries\nabove, I saw a large fountain of porphyry in the middle, throwing up a\nlofty column of water, which fell, with a noise as of the fusion of all\nsweet sounds, into a basin beneath; overflowing which, it ran into a\nsingle channel towards the interior of the building. Although the moon\nwas by this time so low in the west, that not a ray of her light fell\ninto the court, over the height of the surrounding buildings; yet was\nthe court lighted by a second reflex from the sun of other lands. For\nthe top of the column of water, just as it spread to fall, caught the\nmoonbeams, and like a great pale lamp, hung high in the night air, threw\na dim memory of light (as it were) over the court below. This court was\npaved in diamonds of white and red marble. According to my custom since\nI entered Fairy Land, of taking for a guide whatever I first found\nmoving in any direction, I followed the stream from the basin of the\nfountain. It led me to a great open door, beneath the ascending steps of\nwhich it ran through a low arch and disappeared. Entering here, I found\nmyself in a great hall, surrounded with white pillars, and paved with\nblack and white. This I could see by the moonlight, which, from the\nother side, streamed through open windows into the hall.\n\nIts height I could not distinctly see. As soon as I entered, I had\nthe feeling so common to me in the woods, that there were others\nthere besides myself, though I could see no one, and heard no sound to\nindicate a presence. Since my visit to the Church of Darkness, my power\nof seeing the fairies of the higher orders had gradually diminished,\nuntil it had almost ceased. But I could frequently believe in their\npresence while unable to see them. Still, although I had company, and\ndoubtless of a safe kind, it seemed rather dreary to spend the night in\nan empty marble hall, however beautiful, especially as the moon was near\nthe going down, and it would soon be dark. So I began at the place where\nI entered, and walked round the hall, looking for some door or passage\nthat might lead me to a more hospitable chamber. As I walked, I was\ndeliciously haunted with the feeling that behind some one of the\nseemingly innumerable pillars, one who loved me was waiting for me. Then\nI thought she was following me from pillar to pillar as I went along;\nbut no arms came out of the faint moonlight, and no sigh assured me of\nher presence.\n\nAt length I came to an open corridor, into which I turned;\nnotwithstanding that, in doing so, I left the light behind. Along this\nI walked with outstretched hands, groping my way, till, arriving at\nanother corridor, which seemed to strike off at right angles to that in\nwhich I was, I saw at the end a faintly glimmering light, too pale even\nfor moonshine, resembling rather a stray phosphorescence. However, where\neverything was white, a little light went a great way. So I walked on\nto the end, and a long corridor it was. When I came up to the light, I\nfound that it proceeded from what looked like silver letters upon a door\nof ebony; and, to my surprise even in the home of wonder itself, the\nletters formed the words, THE CHAMBER OF SIR ANODOS. Although I had as\nyet no right to the honours of a knight, I ventured to conclude that\nthe chamber was indeed intended for me; and, opening the door without\nhesitation, I entered. Any doubt as to whether I was right in so doing,\nwas soon dispelled. What to my dark eyes seemed a blaze of light, burst\nupon me. A fire of large pieces of some sweet-scented wood, supported by\ndogs of silver, was burning on the hearth, and a bright lamp stood on a\ntable, in the midst of a plentiful meal, apparently awaiting my arrival.\nBut what surprised me more than all, was, that the room was in every\nrespect a copy of my own room, the room whence the little stream from my\nbasin had led me into Fairy Land. There was the very carpet of grass and\nmoss and daisies, which I had myself designed; the curtains of pale blue\nsilk, that fell like a cataract over the windows; the old-fashioned bed,\nwith the chintz furniture, on which I had slept from boyhood. “Now I\nshall sleep,” I said to myself. “My shadow dares not come here.”\n\nI sat down to the table, and began to help myself to the good things\nbefore me with confidence. And now I found, as in many instances before,\nhow true the fairy tales are; for I was waited on, all the time of my\nmeal, by invisible hands. I had scarcely to do more than look towards\nanything I wanted, when it was brought me, just as if it had come to me\nof itself. My glass was kept filled with the wine I had chosen, until\nI looked towards another bottle or decanter; when a fresh glass was\nsubstituted, and the other wine supplied. When I had eaten and drank\nmore heartily and joyfully than ever since I entered Fairy Land, the\nwhole was removed by several attendants, of whom some were male and some\nfemale, as I thought I could distinguish from the way the dishes were\nlifted from the table, and the motion with which they were carried out\nof the room. As soon as they were all taken away, I heard a sound as of\nthe shutting of a door, and knew that I was left alone. I sat long by\nthe fire, meditating, and wondering how it would all end; and when at\nlength, wearied with thinking, I betook myself to my own bed, it was\nhalf with a hope that, when I awoke in the morning, I should awake not\nonly in my own room, but in my own castle also; and that I should walk,\nout upon my own native soil, and find that Fairy Land was, after all,\nonly a vision of the night. The sound of the falling waters of the\nfountain floated me into oblivion.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n            “A wilderness of building, sinking far\n             And self-withdrawn into a wondrous depth,\n             Far sinking into splendour--without end:\n             Fabric it seemed of diamond and of gold,\n             With alabaster domes, and silver spires,\n             And blazing terrace upon terrace, high\n             Uplifted.”\n                                         WORDSWORTH.\n\nBut when, after a sleep, which, although dreamless, yet left behind it a\nsense of past blessedness, I awoke in the full morning, I found, indeed,\nthat the room was still my own; but that it looked abroad upon an\nunknown landscape of forest and hill and dale on the one side--and on\nthe other, upon the marble court, with the great fountain, the crest of\nwhich now flashed glorious in the sun, and cast on the pavement beneath\na shower of faint shadows from the waters that fell from it into the\nmarble basin below.\n\nAgreeably to all authentic accounts of the treatment of travellers in\nFairy Land, I found by my bedside a complete suit of fresh clothing,\njust such as I was in the habit of wearing; for, though varied\nsufficiently from the one removed, it was yet in complete accordance\nwith my tastes. I dressed myself in this, and went out. The whole palace\nshone like silver in the sun. The marble was partly dull and partly\npolished; and every pinnacle, dome, and turret ended in a ball, or cone,\nor cusp of silver. It was like frost-work, and too dazzling, in the sun,\nfor earthly eyes like mine.\n\nI will not attempt to describe the environs, save by saying, that all\nthe pleasures to be found in the most varied and artistic arrangement of\nwood and river, lawn and wild forest, garden and shrubbery, rocky hill\nand luxurious vale; in living creatures wild and tame, in gorgeous\nbirds, scattered fountains, little streams, and reedy lakes--all were\nhere. Some parts of the palace itself I shall have occasion to describe\nmore minutely.\n\nFor this whole morning I never thought of my demon shadow; and not till\nthe weariness which supervened on delight brought it again to my\nmemory, did I look round to see if it was behind me: it was scarcely\ndiscernible. But its presence, however faintly revealed, sent a pang to\nmy heart, for the pain of which, not all the beauties around me could\ncompensate. It was followed, however, by the comforting reflection that,\nperadventure, I might here find the magic word of power to banish\nthe demon and set me free, so that I should no longer be a man beside\nmyself. The Queen of Fairy Land, thought I, must dwell here: surely she\nwill put forth her power to deliver me, and send me singing through\nthe further gates of her country back to my own land. “Shadow of me!”\n I said; “which art not me, but which representest thyself to me as me;\nhere I may find a shadow of light which will devour thee, the shadow of\ndarkness! Here I may find a blessing which will fall on thee as a curse,\nand damn thee to the blackness whence thou hast emerged unbidden.” I\nsaid this, stretched at length on the slope of the lawn above the river;\nand as the hope arose within me, the sun came forth from a light fleecy\ncloud that swept across his face; and hill and dale, and the great river\nwinding on through the still mysterious forest, flashed back his rays as\nwith a silent shout of joy; all nature lived and glowed; the very earth\ngrew warm beneath me; a magnificent dragon-fly went past me like an\narrow from a bow, and a whole concert of birds burst into choral song.\n\nThe heat of the sun soon became too intense even for passive support. I\ntherefore rose, and sought the shelter of one of the arcades. Wandering\nalong from one to another of these, wherever my heedless steps led me,\nand wondering everywhere at the simple magnificence of the building, I\narrived at another hall, the roof of which was of a pale blue, spangled\nwith constellations of silver stars, and supported by porphyry pillars\nof a paler red than ordinary.--In this house (I may remark in passing),\nsilver seemed everywhere preferred to gold; and such was the purity of\nthe air, that it showed nowhere signs of tarnishing.--The whole of the\nfloor of this hall, except a narrow path behind the pillars, paved with\nblack, was hollowed into a huge basin, many feet deep, and filled with\nthe purest, most liquid and radiant water. The sides of the basin were\nwhite marble, and the bottom was paved with all kinds of refulgent\nstones, of every shape and hue.\n\nIn their arrangement, you would have supposed, at first sight, that\nthere was no design, for they seemed to lie as if cast there from\ncareless and playful hands; but it was a most harmonious confusion; and\nas I looked at the play of their colours, especially when the waters\nwere in motion, I came at last to feel as if not one little pebble could\nbe displaced, without injuring the effect of the whole. Beneath this\nfloor of the water, lay the reflection of the blue inverted roof,\nfretted with its silver stars, like a second deeper sea, clasping and\nupholding the first. The fairy bath was probably fed from the fountain\nin the court. Led by an irresistible desire, I undressed, and plunged\ninto the water. It clothed me as with a new sense and its object both in\none. The waters lay so close to me, they seemed to enter and revive my\nheart. I rose to the surface, shook the water from my hair, and swam as\nin a rainbow, amid the coruscations of the gems below seen through the\nagitation caused by my motion. Then, with open eyes, I dived, and swam\nbeneath the surface. And here was a new wonder. For the basin, thus\nbeheld, appeared to extend on all sides like a sea, with here and there\ngroups as of ocean rocks, hollowed by ceaseless billows into wondrous\ncaves and grotesque pinnacles. Around the caves grew sea-weeds of all\nhues, and the corals glowed between; while far off, I saw the glimmer\nof what seemed to be creatures of human form at home in the waters. I\nthought I had been enchanted; and that when I rose to the surface, I\nshould find myself miles from land, swimming alone upon a heaving\nsea; but when my eyes emerged from the waters, I saw above me the blue\nspangled vault, and the red pillars around. I dived again, and found\nmyself once more in the heart of a great sea. I then arose, and swam to\nthe edge, where I got out easily, for the water reached the very brim,\nand, as I drew near washed in tiny waves over the black marble border. I\ndressed, and went out, deeply refreshed.\n\nAnd now I began to discern faint, gracious forms, here and there\nthroughout the building. Some walked together in earnest conversation.\nOthers strayed alone. Some stood in groups, as if looking at and talking\nabout a picture or a statue. None of them heeded me. Nor were they\nplainly visible to my eyes. Sometimes a group, or single individual,\nwould fade entirely out of the realm of my vision as I gazed. When\nevening came, and the moon arose, clear as a round of a horizon-sea when\nthe sun hangs over it in the west, I began to see them all more\nplainly; especially when they came between me and the moon; and yet more\nespecially, when I myself was in the shade. But, even then, I sometimes\nsaw only the passing wave of a white robe; or a lovely arm or neck\ngleamed by in the moonshine; or white feet went walking alone over the\nmoony sward. Nor, I grieve to say, did I ever come much nearer to these\nglorious beings, or ever look upon the Queen of the Fairies herself. My\ndestiny ordered otherwise.\n\nIn this palace of marble and silver, and fountains and moonshine, I\nspent many days; waited upon constantly in my room with everything\ndesirable, and bathing daily in the fairy bath. All this time I was\nlittle troubled with my demon shadow I had a vague feeling that he was\nsomewhere about the palace; but it seemed as if the hope that I should\nin this place be finally freed from his hated presence, had sufficed to\nbanish him for a time. How and where I found him, I shall soon have to\nrelate.\n\nThe third day after my arrival, I found the library of the palace; and\nhere, all the time I remained, I spent most of the middle of the day.\nFor it was, not to mention far greater attractions, a luxurious retreat\nfrom the noontide sun. During the mornings and afternoons, I wandered\nabout the lovely neighbourhood, or lay, lost in delicious day-dreams,\nbeneath some mighty tree on the open lawn. My evenings were by-and-by\nspent in a part of the palace, the account of which, and of my\nadventures in connection with it, I must yet postpone for a little.\n\nThe library was a mighty hall, lighted from the roof, which was formed\nof something like glass, vaulted over in a single piece, and stained\nthroughout with a great mysterious picture in gorgeous colouring.\n\nThe walls were lined from floor to roof with books and books: most of\nthem in ancient bindings, but some in strange new fashions which I had\nnever seen, and which, were I to make the attempt, I could ill describe.\nAll around the walls, in front of the books, ran galleries in rows,\ncommunicating by stairs. These galleries were built of all kinds of\ncoloured stones; all sorts of marble and granite, with porphyry, jasper,\nlapis lazuli, agate, and various others, were ranged in wonderful melody\nof successive colours. Although the material, then, of which these\ngalleries and stairs were built, rendered necessary a certain degree\nof massiveness in the construction, yet such was the size of the place,\nthat they seemed to run along the walls like cords.\n\nOver some parts of the library, descended curtains of silk of various\ndyes, none of which I ever saw lifted while I was there; and I felt\nsomehow that it would be presumptuous in me to venture to look within\nthem. But the use of the other books seemed free; and day after day I\ncame to the library, threw myself on one of the many sumptuous eastern\ncarpets, which lay here and there on the floor, and read, and read,\nuntil weary; if that can be designated as weariness, which was rather\nthe faintness of rapturous delight; or until, sometimes, the failing of\nthe light invited me to go abroad, in the hope that a cool gentle breeze\nmight have arisen to bathe, with an airy invigorating bath, the limbs\nwhich the glow of the burning spirit within had withered no less than\nthe glow of the blazing sun without.\n\nOne peculiarity of these books, or at least most of those I looked into,\nI must make a somewhat vain attempt to describe.\n\nIf, for instance, it was a book of metaphysics I opened, I had scarcely\nread two pages before I seemed to myself to be pondering over discovered\ntruth, and constructing the intellectual machine whereby to communicate\nthe discovery to my fellow men. With some books, however, of this\nnature, it seemed rather as if the process was removed yet a great way\nfurther back; and I was trying to find the root of a manifestation,\nthe spiritual truth whence a material vision sprang; or to combine\ntwo propositions, both apparently true, either at once or in different\nremembered moods, and to find the point in which their invisibly\nconverging lines would unite in one, revealing a truth higher than\neither and differing from both; though so far from being opposed to\neither, that it was that whence each derived its life and power. Or if\nthe book was one of travels, I found myself the traveller. New\nlands, fresh experiences, novel customs, rose around me. I walked, I\ndiscovered, I fought, I suffered, I rejoiced in my success. Was it a\nhistory? I was the chief actor therein. I suffered my own blame; I was\nglad in my own praise. With a fiction it was the same. Mine was the\nwhole story. For I took the place of the character who was most like\nmyself, and his story was mine; until, grown weary with the life of\nyears condensed in an hour, or arrived at my deathbed, or the end of the\nvolume, I would awake, with a sudden bewilderment, to the consciousness\nof my present life, recognising the walls and roof around me, and\nfinding I joyed or sorrowed only in a book. If the book was a poem, the\nwords disappeared, or took the subordinate position of an accompaniment\nto the succession of forms and images that rose and vanished with a\nsoundless rhythm, and a hidden rime.\n\nIn one, with a mystical title, which I cannot recall, I read of a\nworld that is not like ours. The wondrous account, in such a feeble,\nfragmentary way as is possible to me, I would willingly impart. Whether\nor not it was all a poem, I cannot tell; but, from the impulse I felt,\nwhen I first contemplated writing it, to break into rime, to which\nimpulse I shall give way if it comes upon me again, I think it must have\nbeen, partly at least, in verse.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n            “Chained is the Spring.  The night-wind bold\n              Blows over the hard earth;\n             Time is not more confused and cold,\n              Nor keeps more wintry mirth.\n\n            “Yet blow, and roll the world about;\n               Blow, Time--blow, winter’s Wind!\n             Through chinks of Time, heaven peepeth out,\n               And Spring the frost behind.”\n                                         G. E. M.\n\nThey who believe in the influences of the stars over the fates of men,\nare, in feeling at least, nearer the truth than they who regard the\nheavenly bodies as related to them merely by a common obedience to an\nexternal law. All that man sees has to do with man. Worlds cannot be\nwithout an intermundane relationship. The community of the centre of\nall creation suggests an interradiating connection and dependence of\nthe parts. Else a grander idea is conceivable than that which is already\nimbodied. The blank, which is only a forgotten life, lying behind the\nconsciousness, and the misty splendour, which is an undeveloped\nlife, lying before it, may be full of mysterious revelations of other\nconnexions with the worlds around us, than those of science and\npoetry. No shining belt or gleaming moon, no red and green glory in a\nself-encircling twin-star, but has a relation with the hidden things\nof a man’s soul, and, it may be, with the secret history of his body as\nwell. They are portions of the living house wherein he abides.\n\n             Through the realms of the monarch Sun\n         Creeps a world, whose course had begun,\n         On a weary path with a weary pace,\n         Before the Earth sprang forth on her race:\n         But many a time the Earth had sped\n         Around the path she still must tread,\n         Ere the elder planet, on leaden wing,\n         Once circled the court of the planet’s king.\n\n            There, in that lonely and distant star,\n         The seasons are not as our seasons are;\n         But many a year hath Autumn to dress\n         The trees in their matron loveliness;\n         As long hath old Winter in triumph to go\n         O’er beauties dead in his vaults below;\n         And many a year the Spring doth wear\n         Combing the icicles from her hair;\n         And Summer, dear Summer, hath years of June,\n         With large white clouds, and cool showers at noon:\n         And a beauty that grows to a weight like grief,\n         Till a burst of tears is the heart’s relief.\n\n            Children, born when Winter is king,\n         May never rejoice in the hoping Spring;\n         Though their own heart-buds are bursting with joy,\n         And the child hath grown to the girl or boy;\n         But may die with cold and icy hours\n         Watching them ever in place of flowers.\n         And some who awake from their primal sleep,\n         When the sighs of Summer through forests creep,\n         Live, and love, and are loved again;\n         Seek for pleasure, and find its pain;\n         Sink to their last, their forsaken sleeping,\n         With the same sweet odours around them creeping.\n\nNow the children, there, are not born as the children are born in worlds\nnearer to the sun. For they arrive no one knows how. A maiden, walking\nalone, hears a cry: for even there a cry is the first utterance; and\nsearching about, she findeth, under an overhanging rock, or within a\nclump of bushes, or, it may be, betwixt gray stones on the side of a\nhill, or in any other sheltered and unexpected spot, a little child.\nThis she taketh tenderly, and beareth home with joy, calling out,\n“Mother, mother”--if so be that her mother lives--“I have got a baby--I\nhave found a child!” All the household gathers round to see;--“WHERE IS\nIT? WHAT IS IT LIKE? WHERE DID YOU FIND IT?” and such-like questions,\nabounding. And thereupon she relates the whole story of the discovery;\nfor by the circumstances, such as season of the year, time of the day,\ncondition of the air, and such like, and, especially, the peculiar and\nnever-repeated aspect of the heavens and earth at the time, and the\nnature of the place of shelter wherein it is found, is determined, or at\nleast indicated, the nature of the child thus discovered. Therefore,\nat certain seasons, and in certain states of the weather, according, in\npart, to their own fancy, the young women go out to look for children.\nThey generally avoid seeking them, though they cannot help sometimes\nfinding them, in places and with circumstances uncongenial to their\npeculiar likings. But no sooner is a child found, than its claim for\nprotection and nurture obliterates all feeling of choice in the matter.\nChiefly, however, in the season of summer, which lasts so long, coming\nas it does after such long intervals; and mostly in the warm evenings,\nabout the middle of twilight; and principally in the woods and along\nthe river banks, do the maidens go looking for children just as children\nlook for flowers. And ever as the child grows, yea, more and more as he\nadvances in years, will his face indicate to those who understand the\nspirit of Nature, and her utterances in the face of the world, the\nnature of the place of his birth, and the other circumstances thereof;\nwhether a clear morning sun guided his mother to the nook whence issued\nthe boy’s low cry; or at eve the lonely maiden (for the same woman never\nfinds a second, at least while the first lives) discovers the girl by\nthe glimmer of her white skin, lying in a nest like that of the lark,\namid long encircling grasses, and the upward-gazing eyes of the lowly\ndaisies; whether the storm bowed the forest trees around, or the still\nfrost fixed in silence the else flowing and babbling stream.\n\nAfter they grow up, the men and women are but little together. There is\nthis peculiar difference between them, which likewise distinguishes the\nwomen from those of the earth. The men alone have arms; the women\nhave only wings. Resplendent wings are they, wherein they can shroud\nthemselves from head to foot in a panoply of glistering glory. By these\nwings alone, it may frequently be judged in what seasons, and under what\naspects, they were born. From those that came in winter, go great white\nwings, white as snow; the edge of every feather shining like the sheen\nof silver, so that they flash and glitter like frost in the sun. But\nunderneath, they are tinged with a faint pink or rose-colour. Those born\nin spring have wings of a brilliant green, green as grass; and\ntowards the edges the feathers are enamelled like the surface of the\ngrass-blades. These again are white within. Those that are born in\nsummer have wings of a deep rose-colour, lined with pale gold. And those\nborn in autumn have purple wings, with a rich brown on the inside. But\nthese colours are modified and altered in all varieties, corresponding\nto the mood of the day and hour, as well as the season of the year; and\nsometimes I found the various colours so intermingled, that I could not\ndetermine even the season, though doubtless the hieroglyphic could be\ndeciphered by more experienced eyes. One splendour, in particular, I\nremember--wings of deep carmine, with an inner down of warm gray, around\na form of brilliant whiteness.\n\nShe had been found as the sun went down through a low sea-fog, casting\ncrimson along a broad sea-path into a little cave on the shore, where a\nbathing maiden saw her lying.\n\nBut though I speak of sun and fog, and sea and shore, the world there\nis in some respects very different from the earth whereon men live.\nFor instance, the waters reflect no forms. To the unaccustomed eye they\nappear, if undisturbed, like the surface of a dark metal, only that\nthe latter would reflect indistinctly, whereas they reflect not at all,\nexcept light which falls immediately upon them. This has a great effect\nin causing the landscapes to differ from those on the earth. On\nthe stillest evening, no tall ship on the sea sends a long wavering\nreflection almost to the feet of him on shore; the face of no maiden\nbrightens at its own beauty in a still forest-well. The sun and moon\nalone make a glitter on the surface. The sea is like a sea of death,\nready to ingulf and never to reveal: a visible shadow of oblivion. Yet\nthe women sport in its waters like gorgeous sea-birds. The men more\nrarely enter them. But, on the contrary, the sky reflects everything\nbeneath it, as if it were built of water like ours. Of course, from\nits concavity there is some distortion of the reflected objects; yet\nwondrous combinations of form are often to be seen in the overhanging\ndepth. And then it is not shaped so much like a round dome as the sky of\nthe earth, but, more of an egg-shape, rises to a great towering height\nin the middle, appearing far more lofty than the other. When the stars\ncome out at night, it shows a mighty cupola, “fretted with golden\nfires,” wherein there is room for all tempests to rush and rave.\n\nOne evening in early summer, I stood with a group of men and women on a\nsteep rock that overhung the sea. They were all questioning me about my\nworld and the ways thereof. In making reply to one of their questions,\nI was compelled to say that children are not born in the Earth as with\nthem. Upon this I was assailed with a whole battery of inquiries, which\nat first I tried to avoid; but, at last, I was compelled, in the vaguest\nmanner I could invent, to make some approach to the subject in question.\nImmediately a dim notion of what I meant, seemed to dawn in the minds\nof most of the women. Some of them folded their great wings all around\nthem, as they generally do when in the least offended, and stood erect\nand motionless. One spread out her rosy pinions, and flashed from the\npromontory into the gulf at its foot. A great light shone in the eyes of\none maiden, who turned and walked slowly away, with her purple and white\nwings half dispread behind her. She was found, the next morning, dead\nbeneath a withered tree on a bare hill-side, some miles inland. They\nburied her where she lay, as is their custom; for, before they die,\nthey instinctively search for a spot like the place of their birth, and\nhaving found one that satisfies them, they lie down, fold their wings\naround them, if they be women, or cross their arms over their breasts,\nif they are men, just as if they were going to sleep; and so sleep\nindeed. The sign or cause of coming death is an indescribable longing\nfor something, they know not what, which seizes them, and drives them\ninto solitude, consuming them within, till the body fails. When a youth\nand a maiden look too deep into each other’s eyes, this longing seizes\nand possesses them; but instead of drawing nearer to each other, they\nwander away, each alone, into solitary places, and die of their desire.\nBut it seems to me, that thereafter they are born babes upon our earth:\nwhere, if, when grown, they find each other, it goes well with them;\nif not, it will seem to go ill. But of this I know nothing. When I told\nthem that the women on the Earth had not wings like them, but arms, they\nstared, and said how bold and masculine they must look; not knowing that\ntheir wings, glorious as they are, are but undeveloped arms.\n\nBut see the power of this book, that, while recounting what I can recall\nof its contents, I write as if myself had visited the far-off planet,\nlearned its ways and appearances, and conversed with its men and women.\nAnd so, while writing, it seemed to me that I had.\n\nThe book goes on with the story of a maiden, who, born at the close of\nautumn, and living in a long, to her endless winter, set out at last\nto find the regions of spring; for, as in our earth, the seasons are\ndivided over the globe. It begins something like this:\n\n            She watched them dying for many a day,\n            Dropping from off the old trees away,\n            One by one; or else in a shower\n            Crowding over the withered flower\n            For as if they had done some grievous wrong,\n            The sun, that had nursed them and loved them so long,\n            Grew weary of loving, and, turning back,\n            Hastened away on his southern track;\n            And helplessly hung each shrivelled leaf,\n            Faded away with an idle grief.\n            And the gusts of wind, sad Autumn’s sighs,\n            Mournfully swept through their families;\n            Casting away with a helpless moan\n            All that he yet might call his own,\n            As the child, when his bird is gone for ever,\n            Flingeth the cage on the wandering river.\n            And the giant trees, as bare as Death,\n            Slowly bowed to the great Wind’s breath;\n            And groaned with trying to keep from groaning\n            Amidst the young trees bending and moaning.\n            And the ancient planet’s mighty sea\n            Was heaving and falling most restlessly,\n            And the tops of the waves were broken and white,\n            Tossing about to ease their might;\n            And the river was striving to reach the main,\n            And the ripple was hurrying back again.\n            Nature lived in sadness now;\n            Sadness lived on the maiden’s brow,\n            As she watched, with a fixed, half-conscious eye,\n            One lonely leaf that trembled on high,\n            Till it dropped at last from the desolate bough--\n            Sorrow, oh, sorrow! ‘tis winter now.\n            And her tears gushed forth, though it was but a leaf,\n            For little will loose the swollen fountain of grief:\n            When up to the lip the water goes,\n            It needs but a drop, and it overflows.\n\n            Oh! many and many a dreary year\n            Must pass away ere the buds appear:\n            Many a night of darksome sorrow\n            Yield to the light of a joyless morrow,\n            Ere birds again, on the clothed trees,\n            Shall fill the branches with melodies.\n            She will dream of meadows with wakeful streams;\n            Of wavy grass in the sunny beams;\n            Of hidden wells that soundless spring,\n            Hoarding their joy as a holy thing;\n            Of founts that tell it all day long\n            To the listening woods, with exultant song;\n            She will dream of evenings that die into nights,\n            Where each sense is filled with its own delights,\n            And the soul is still as the vaulted sky,\n            Lulled with an inner harmony;\n\n            And the flowers give out to the dewy night,\n            Changed into perfume, the gathered light;\n            And the darkness sinks upon all their host,\n            Till the sun sail up on the eastern coast--\n            She will wake and see the branches bare,\n            Weaving a net in the frozen air.\n\n\n\nThe story goes on to tell how, at last, weary with wintriness, she\ntravelled towards the southern regions of her globe, to meet the spring\non its slow way northwards; and how, after many sad adventures, many\ndisappointed hopes, and many tears, bitter and fruitless, she found\nat last, one stormy afternoon, in a leafless forest, a single snowdrop\ngrowing betwixt the borders of the winter and spring. She lay down\nbeside it and died. I almost believe that a child, pale and peaceful as\na snowdrop, was born in the Earth within a fixed season from that stormy\nafternoon.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n             “I saw a ship sailing upon the sea\n              Deeply laden as ship could be;\n              But not so deep as in love I am\n              For I care not whether I sink or swim.”\n                                     Old Ballad.\n\n            “But Love is such a Mystery\n                 I cannot find it out:\n              For when I think I’m best resolv’d,\n                 I then am in most doubt.”\n                                SIR JOHN SUCKLING.\n\nOne story I will try to reproduce. But, alas! it is like trying to\nreconstruct a forest out of broken branches and withered leaves. In the\nfairy book, everything was just as it should be, though whether in words\nor something else, I cannot tell. It glowed and flashed the thoughts\nupon the soul, with such a power that the medium disappeared from the\nconsciousness, and it was occupied only with the things themselves.\nMy representation of it must resemble a translation from a rich and\npowerful language, capable of embodying the thoughts of a splendidly\ndeveloped people, into the meagre and half-articulate speech of a savage\ntribe. Of course, while I read it, I was Cosmo, and his history\nwas mine. Yet, all the time, I seemed to have a kind of double\nconsciousness, and the story a double meaning. Sometimes it seemed\nonly to represent a simple story of ordinary life, perhaps almost of\nuniversal life; wherein two souls, loving each other and longing to come\nnearer, do, after all, but behold each other as in a glass darkly.\n\nAs through the hard rock go the branching silver veins; as into the\nsolid land run the creeks and gulfs from the unresting sea; as the\nlights and influences of the upper worlds sink silently through\nthe earth’s atmosphere; so doth Faerie invade the world of men, and\nsometimes startle the common eye with an association as of cause and\neffect, when between the two no connecting links can be traced.\n\nCosmo von Wehrstahl was a student at the University of Prague. Though\nof a noble family, he was poor, and prided himself upon the independence\nthat poverty gives; for what will not a man pride himself upon, when he\ncannot get rid of it? A favourite with his fellow students, he yet had\nno companions; and none of them had ever crossed the threshold of his\nlodging in the top of one of the highest houses in the old town. Indeed,\nthe secret of much of that complaisance which recommended him to his\nfellows, was the thought of his unknown retreat, whither in the evening\nhe could betake himself and indulge undisturbed in his own studies and\nreveries. These studies, besides those subjects necessary to his course\nat the University, embraced some less commonly known and approved;\nfor in a secret drawer lay the works of Albertus Magnus and Cornelius\nAgrippa, along with others less read and more abstruse. As yet, however,\nhe had followed these researches only from curiosity, and had turned\nthem to no practical purpose.\n\nHis lodging consisted of one large low-ceiled room, singularly bare of\nfurniture; for besides a couple of wooden chairs, a couch which served\nfor dreaming on both by day and night, and a great press of black oak,\nthere was very little in the room that could be called furniture.\n\nBut curious instruments were heaped in the corners; and in one stood\na skeleton, half-leaning against the wall, half-supported by a string\nabout its neck. One of its hands, all of fingers, rested on the heavy\npommel of a great sword that stood beside it.\n\nVarious weapons were scattered about over the floor. The walls were\nutterly bare of adornment; for the few strange things, such as a large\ndried bat with wings dispread, the skin of a porcupine, and a stuffed\nsea-mouse, could hardly be reckoned as such. But although his fancy\ndelighted in vagaries like these, he indulged his imagination with far\ndifferent fare. His mind had never yet been filled with an absorbing\npassion; but it lay like a still twilight open to any wind, whether the\nlow breath that wafts but odours, or the storm that bows the great trees\ntill they strain and creak. He saw everything as through a rose-coloured\nglass. When he looked from his window on the street below, not a maiden\npassed but she moved as in a story, and drew his thoughts after her till\nshe disappeared in the vista. When he walked in the streets, he always\nfelt as if reading a tale, into which he sought to weave every face of\ninterest that went by; and every sweet voice swept his soul as with the\nwing of a passing angel. He was in fact a poet without words; the more\nabsorbed and endangered, that the springing-waters were dammed back\ninto his soul, where, finding no utterance, they grew, and swelled, and\nundermined. He used to lie on his hard couch, and read a tale or a poem,\ntill the book dropped from his hand; but he dreamed on, he knew not\nwhether awake or asleep, until the opposite roof grew upon his sense,\nand turned golden in the sunrise. Then he arose too; and the impulses of\nvigorous youth kept him ever active, either in study or in sport, until\nagain the close of the day left him free; and the world of night, which\nhad lain drowned in the cataract of the day, rose up in his soul, with\nall its stars, and dim-seen phantom shapes. But this could hardly last\nlong. Some one form must sooner or later step within the charmed circle,\nenter the house of life, and compel the bewildered magician to kneel and\nworship.\n\nOne afternoon, towards dusk, he was wandering dreamily in one of the\nprincipal streets, when a fellow student roused him by a slap on the\nshoulder, and asked him to accompany him into a little back alley to\nlook at some old armour which he had taken a fancy to possess. Cosmo was\nconsidered an authority in every matter pertaining to arms, ancient or\nmodern. In the use of weapons, none of the students could come near him;\nand his practical acquaintance with some had principally contributed\nto establish his authority in reference to all. He accompanied him\nwillingly.\n\nThey entered a narrow alley, and thence a dirty little court, where\na low arched door admitted them into a heterogeneous assemblage of\neverything musty, and dusty, and old, that could well be imagined.\nHis verdict on the armour was satisfactory, and his companion at once\nconcluded the purchase. As they were leaving the place, Cosmo’s eye was\nattracted by an old mirror of an elliptical shape, which leaned against\nthe wall, covered with dust. Around it was some curious carving, which\nhe could see but very indistinctly by the glimmering light which\nthe owner of the shop carried in his hand. It was this carving that\nattracted his attention; at least so it appeared to him. He left the\nplace, however, with his friend, taking no further notice of it. They\nwalked together to the main street, where they parted and took opposite\ndirections.\n\nNo sooner was Cosmo left alone, than the thought of the curious old\nmirror returned to him. A strong desire to see it more plainly arose\nwithin him, and he directed his steps once more towards the shop. The\nowner opened the door when he knocked, as if he had expected him. He\nwas a little, old, withered man, with a hooked nose, and burning eyes\nconstantly in a slow restless motion, and looking here and there as if\nafter something that eluded them. Pretending to examine several other\narticles, Cosmo at last approached the mirror, and requested to have it\ntaken down.\n\n“Take it down yourself, master; I cannot reach it,” said the old man.\n\nCosmo took it down carefully, when he saw that the carving was indeed\ndelicate and costly, being both of admirable design and execution;\ncontaining withal many devices which seemed to embody some meaning\nto which he had no clue. This, naturally, in one of his tastes and\ntemperament, increased the interest he felt in the old mirror; so much,\nindeed, that he now longed to possess it, in order to study its frame at\nhis leisure. He pretended, however, to want it only for use; and saying\nhe feared the plate could be of little service, as it was rather old, he\nbrushed away a little of the dust from its face, expecting to see a dull\nreflection within. His surprise was great when he found the reflection\nbrilliant, revealing a glass not only uninjured by age, but wondrously\nclear and perfect (should the whole correspond to this part) even for\none newly from the hands of the maker. He asked carelessly what the\nowner wanted for the thing. The old man replied by mentioning a sum of\nmoney far beyond the reach of poor Cosmo, who proceeded to replace the\nmirror where it had stood before.\n\n“You think the price too high?” said the old man.\n\n“I do not know that it is too much for you to ask,” replied Cosmo; “but\nit is far too much for me to give.”\n\nThe old man held up his light towards Cosmo’s face. “I like your look,”\n said he.\n\nCosmo could not return the compliment. In fact, now he looked closely\nat him for the first time, he felt a kind of repugnance to him, mingled\nwith a strange feeling of doubt whether a man or a woman stood before\nhim.\n\n“What is your name?” he continued.\n\n“Cosmo von Wehrstahl.”\n\n“Ah, ah! I thought as much. I see your father in you. I knew your father\nvery well, young sir. I dare say in some odd corners of my house, you\nmight find some old things with his crest and cipher upon them still.\nWell, I like you: you shall have the mirror at the fourth part of what I\nasked for it; but upon one condition.”\n\n“What is that?” said Cosmo; for, although the price was still a great\ndeal for him to give, he could just manage it; and the desire to possess\nthe mirror had increased to an altogether unaccountable degree, since it\nhad seemed beyond his reach.\n\n“That if you should ever want to get rid of it again, you will let me\nhave the first offer.”\n\n“Certainly,” replied Cosmo, with a smile; adding, “a moderate condition\nindeed.”\n\n“On your honour?” insisted the seller.\n\n“On my honour,” said the buyer; and the bargain was concluded.\n\n“I will carry it home for you,” said the old man, as Cosmo took it in\nhis hands.\n\n“No, no; I will carry it myself,” said he; for he had a peculiar dislike\nto revealing his residence to any one, and more especially to this\nperson, to whom he felt every moment a greater antipathy. “Just as you\nplease,” said the old creature, and muttered to himself as he held his\nlight at the door to show him out of the court: “Sold for the sixth\ntime! I wonder what will be the upshot of it this time. I should think\nmy lady had enough of it by now!”\n\nCosmo carried his prize carefully home. But all the way he had an\nuncomfortable feeling that he was watched and dogged. Repeatedly he\nlooked about, but saw nothing to justify his suspicions. Indeed, the\nstreets were too crowded and too ill lighted to expose very readily\na careful spy, if such there should be at his heels. He reached his\nlodging in safety, and leaned his purchase against the wall, rather\nrelieved, strong as he was, to be rid of its weight; then, lighting his\npipe, threw himself on the couch, and was soon lapt in the folds of one\nof his haunting dreams.\n\nHe returned home earlier than usual the next day, and fixed the mirror\nto the wall, over the hearth, at one end of his long room.\n\nHe then carefully wiped away the dust from its face, and, clear as the\nwater of a sunny spring, the mirror shone out from beneath the envious\ncovering. But his interest was chiefly occupied with the curious carving\nof the frame. This he cleaned as well as he could with a brush; and then\nhe proceeded to a minute examination of its various parts, in the hope\nof discovering some index to the intention of the carver. In this,\nhowever, he was unsuccessful; and, at length, pausing with some\nweariness and disappointment, he gazed vacantly for a few moments into\nthe depth of the reflected room. But ere long he said, half aloud: “What\na strange thing a mirror is! and what a wondrous affinity exists between\nit and a man’s imagination! For this room of mine, as I behold it in\nthe glass, is the same, and yet not the same. It is not the mere\nrepresentation of the room I live in, but it looks just as if I were\nreading about it in a story I like. All its commonness has disappeared.\nThe mirror has lifted it out of the region of fact into the realm of\nart; and the very representing of it to me has clothed with interest\nthat which was otherwise hard and bare; just as one sees with delight\nupon the stage the representation of a character from which one would\nescape in life as from something unendurably wearisome. But is it not\nrather that art rescues nature from the weary and sated regards of our\nsenses, and the degrading injustice of our anxious everyday life, and,\nappealing to the imagination, which dwells apart, reveals Nature in some\ndegree as she really is, and as she represents herself to the eye of the\nchild, whose every-day life, fearless and unambitious, meets the true\nimport of the wonder-teeming world around him, and rejoices therein\nwithout questioning? That skeleton, now--I almost fear it, standing\nthere so still, with eyes only for the unseen, like a watch-tower\nlooking across all the waste of this busy world into the quiet regions\nof rest beyond. And yet I know every bone and every joint in it as well\nas my own fist. And that old battle-axe looks as if any moment it might\nbe caught up by a mailed hand, and, borne forth by the mighty arm, go\ncrashing through casque, and skull, and brain, invading the Unknown with\nyet another bewildered ghost. I should like to live in THAT room if I\ncould only get into it.”\n\nScarcely had the half-moulded words floated from him, as he stood gazing\ninto the mirror, when, striking him as with a flash of amazement that\nfixed him in his posture, noiseless and unannounced, glided suddenly\nthrough the door into the reflected room, with stately motion, yet\nreluctant and faltering step, the graceful form of a woman, clothed all\nin white. Her back only was visible as she walked slowly up to the\ncouch in the further end of the room, on which she laid herself\nwearily, turning towards him a face of unutterable loveliness, in which\nsuffering, and dislike, and a sense of compulsion, strangely mingled\nwith the beauty. He stood without the power of motion for some moments,\nwith his eyes irrecoverably fixed upon her; and even after he was\nconscious of the ability to move, he could not summon up courage to\nturn and look on her, face to face, in the veritable chamber in which\nhe stood. At length, with a sudden effort, in which the exercise of the\nwill was so pure, that it seemed involuntary, he turned his face to the\ncouch. It was vacant. In bewilderment, mingled with terror, he turned\nagain to the mirror: there, on the reflected couch, lay the exquisite\nlady-form. She lay with closed eyes, whence two large tears were just\nwelling from beneath the veiling lids; still as death, save for the\nconvulsive motion of her bosom.\n\nCosmo himself could not have described what he felt. His emotions were\nof a kind that destroyed consciousness, and could never be clearly\nrecalled. He could not help standing yet by the mirror, and keeping his\neyes fixed on the lady, though he was painfully aware of his rudeness,\nand feared every moment that she would open hers, and meet his fixed\nregard. But he was, ere long, a little relieved; for, after a while, her\neyelids slowly rose, and her eyes remained uncovered, but unemployed for\na time; and when, at length, they began to wander about the room, as if\nlanguidly seeking to make some acquaintance with her environment, they\nwere never directed towards him: it seemed nothing but what was in the\nmirror could affect her vision; and, therefore, if she saw him at all,\nit could only be his back, which, of necessity, was turned towards her\nin the glass. The two figures in the mirror could not meet face to face,\nexcept he turned and looked at her, present in his room; and, as she was\nnot there, he concluded that if he were to turn towards the part in his\nroom corresponding to that in which she lay, his reflection would either\nbe invisible to her altogether, or at least it must appear to her to\ngaze vacantly towards her, and no meeting of the eyes would produce\nthe impression of spiritual proximity. By-and-by her eyes fell upon the\nskeleton, and he saw her shudder and close them. She did not open them\nagain, but signs of repugnance continued evident on her countenance.\nCosmo would have removed the obnoxious thing at once, but he feared to\ndiscompose her yet more by the assertion of his presence which the act\nwould involve. So he stood and watched her. The eyelids yet shrouded\nthe eyes, as a costly case the jewels within; the troubled expression\ngradually faded from the countenance, leaving only a faint sorrow\nbehind; the features settled into an unchanging expression of rest; and\nby these signs, and the slow regular motion of her breathing, Cosmo knew\nthat she slept. He could now gaze on her without embarrassment. He saw\nthat her figure, dressed in the simplest robe of white, was worthy of\nher face; and so harmonious, that either the delicately moulded foot, or\nany finger of the equally delicate hand, was an index to the whole. As\nshe lay, her whole form manifested the relaxation of perfect repose. He\ngazed till he was weary, and at last seated himself near the new-found\nshrine, and mechanically took up a book, like one who watches by a\nsick-bed. But his eyes gathered no thoughts from the page before him.\nHis intellect had been stunned by the bold contradiction, to its face,\nof all its experience, and now lay passive, without assertion, or\nspeculation, or even conscious astonishment; while his imagination sent\none wild dream of blessedness after another coursing through his soul.\nHow long he sat he knew not; but at length he roused himself, rose, and,\ntrembling in every portion of his frame, looked again into the mirror.\nShe was gone. The mirror reflected faithfully what his room presented,\nand nothing more. It stood there like a golden setting whence the\ncentral jewel has been stolen away--like a night-sky without the glory\nof its stars. She had carried with her all the strangeness of the\nreflected room. It had sunk to the level of the one without.\n\nBut when the first pangs of his disappointment had passed, Cosmo began\nto comfort himself with the hope that she might return, perhaps the next\nevening, at the same hour. Resolving that if she did, she should not\nat least be scared by the hateful skeleton, he removed that and several\nother articles of questionable appearance into a recess by the side of\nthe hearth, whence they could not possibly cast any reflection into the\nmirror; and having made his poor room as tidy as he could, sought the\nsolace of the open sky and of a night wind that had begun to blow, for\nhe could not rest where he was. When he returned, somewhat composed, he\ncould hardly prevail with himself to lie down on his bed; for he could\nnot help feeling as if she had lain upon it; and for him to lie there\nnow would be something like sacrilege. However, weariness prevailed; and\nlaying himself on the couch, dressed as he was, he slept till day.\n\nWith a beating heart, beating till he could hardly breathe, he stood\nin dumb hope before the mirror, on the following evening. Again the\nreflected room shone as through a purple vapour in the gathering\ntwilight. Everything seemed waiting like himself for a coming splendour\nto glorify its poor earthliness with the presence of a heavenly joy. And\njust as the room vibrated with the strokes of the neighbouring church\nbell, announcing the hour of six, in glided the pale beauty, and again\nlaid herself on the couch. Poor Cosmo nearly lost his senses with\ndelight. She was there once more! Her eyes sought the corner where the\nskeleton had stood, and a faint gleam of satisfaction crossed her face,\napparently at seeing it empty. She looked suffering still, but there was\nless of discomfort expressed in her countenance than there had been the\nnight before. She took more notice of the things about her, and seemed\nto gaze with some curiosity on the strange apparatus standing here and\nthere in her room. At length, however, drowsiness seemed to overtake\nher, and again she fell asleep. Resolved not to lose sight of her this\ntime, Cosmo watched the sleeping form. Her slumber was so deep and\nabsorbing that a fascinating repose seemed to pass contagiously from her\nto him as he gazed upon her; and he started as if from a dream, when\nthe lady moved, and, without opening her eyes, rose, and passed from the\nroom with the gait of a somnambulist.\n\nCosmo was now in a state of extravagant delight. Most men have a secret\ntreasure somewhere. The miser has his golden hoard; the virtuoso his pet\nring; the student his rare book; the poet his favourite haunt; the lover\nhis secret drawer; but Cosmo had a mirror with a lovely lady in it. And\nnow that he knew by the skeleton, that she was affected by the things\naround her, he had a new object in life: he would turn the bare chamber\nin the mirror into a room such as no lady need disdain to call her own.\nThis he could effect only by furnishing and adorning his. And Cosmo was\npoor. Yet he possessed accomplishments that could be turned to account;\nalthough, hitherto, he had preferred living on his slender allowance, to\nincreasing his means by what his pride considered unworthy of his rank.\nHe was the best swordsman in the University; and now he offered to give\nlessons in fencing and similar exercises, to such as chose to pay\nhim well for the trouble. His proposal was heard with surprise by the\nstudents; but it was eagerly accepted by many; and soon his instructions\nwere not confined to the richer students, but were anxiously sought by\nmany of the young nobility of Prague and its neighbourhood. So that very\nsoon he had a good deal of money at his command. The first thing he did\nwas to remove his apparatus and oddities into a closet in the room.\nThen he placed his bed and a few other necessaries on each side of the\nhearth, and parted them from the rest of the room by two screens of\nIndian fabric. Then he put an elegant couch for the lady to lie upon, in\nthe corner where his bed had formerly stood; and, by degrees, every\nday adding some article of luxury, converted it, at length, into a rich\nboudoir.\n\nEvery night, about the same time, the lady entered. The first time she\nsaw the new couch, she started with a half-smile; then her face grew\nvery sad, the tears came to her eyes, and she laid herself upon the\ncouch, and pressed her face into the silken cushions, as if to hide from\neverything. She took notice of each addition and each change as the work\nproceeded; and a look of acknowledgment, as if she knew that some\none was ministering to her, and was grateful for it, mingled with the\nconstant look of suffering. At length, after she had lain down as usual\none evening, her eyes fell upon some paintings with which Cosmo had just\nfinished adorning the walls. She rose, and to his great delight, walked\nacross the room, and proceeded to examine them carefully, testifying\nmuch pleasure in her looks as she did so. But again the sorrowful,\ntearful expression returned, and again she buried her face in the\npillows of her couch. Gradually, however, her countenance had grown more\ncomposed; much of the suffering manifest on her first appearance had\nvanished, and a kind of quiet, hopeful expression had taken its place;\nwhich, however, frequently gave way to an anxious, troubled look,\nmingled with something of sympathetic pity.\n\nMeantime, how fared Cosmo? As might be expected in one of his\ntemperament, his interest had blossomed into love, and his love--shall\nI call it RIPENED, or--WITHERED into passion. But, alas! he loved a\nshadow. He could not come near her, could not speak to her, could not\nhear a sound from those sweet lips, to which his longing eyes would\ncling like bees to their honey-founts. Ever and anon he sang to himself:\n\n            “I shall die for love of the maiden;”\n\nand ever he looked again, and died not, though his heart seemed ready to\nbreak with intensity of life and longing. And the more he did for her,\nthe more he loved her; and he hoped that, although she never appeared\nto see him, yet she was pleased to think that one unknown would give his\nlife to her. He tried to comfort himself over his separation from her,\nby thinking that perhaps some day she would see him and make signs to\nhim, and that would satisfy him; “for,” thought he, “is not this all\nthat a loving soul can do to enter into communion with another? Nay,\nhow many who love never come nearer than to behold each other as in a\nmirror; seem to know and yet never know the inward life; never enter\nthe other soul; and part at last, with but the vaguest notion of the\nuniverse on the borders of which they have been hovering for years? If\nI could but speak to her, and knew that she heard me, I should be\nsatisfied.” Once he contemplated painting a picture on the wall, which\nshould, of necessity, convey to the lady a thought of himself; but,\nthough he had some skill with the pencil, he found his hand tremble so\nmuch when he began the attempt, that he was forced to give it up. . . .\n. .\n\n        “Who lives, he dies; who dies, he is alive.”\n\n One evening, as he stood gazing on his treasure, he thought he\nsaw a faint expression of self-consciousness on her countenance, as if\nshe surmised that passionate eyes were fixed upon her. This grew; till\nat last the red blood rose over her neck, and cheek, and brow. Cosmo’s\nlonging to approach her became almost delirious. This night she was\ndressed in an evening costume, resplendent with diamonds. This could add\nnothing to her beauty, but it presented it in a new aspect; enabled her\nloveliness to make a new manifestation of itself in a new embodiment.\nFor essential beauty is infinite; and, as the soul of Nature needs an\nendless succession of varied forms to embody her loveliness, countless\nfaces of beauty springing forth, not any two the same, at any one of\nher heart-throbs; so the individual form needs an infinite change of its\nenvironments, to enable it to uncover all the phases of its loveliness.\nDiamonds glittered from amidst her hair, half hidden in its luxuriance,\nlike stars through dark rain-clouds; and the bracelets on her white arms\nflashed all the colours of a rainbow of lightnings, as she lifted her\nsnowy hands to cover her burning face. But her beauty shone down all its\nadornment. “If I might have but one of her feet to kiss,” thought Cosmo,\n“I should be content.” Alas! he deceived himself, for passion is never\ncontent. Nor did he know that there are TWO ways out of her enchanted\nhouse. But, suddenly, as if the pang had been driven into his heart\nfrom without, revealing itself first in pain, and afterwards in definite\nform, the thought darted into his mind, “She has a lover somewhere.\nRemembered words of his bring the colour on her face now. I am nowhere\nto her. She lives in another world all day, and all night, after she\nleaves me. Why does she come and make me love her, till I, a strong man,\nam too faint to look upon her more?” He looked again, and her face was\npale as a lily. A sorrowful compassion seemed to rebuke the glitter of\nthe restless jewels, and the slow tears rose in her eyes. She left her\nroom sooner this evening than was her wont. Cosmo remained alone, with a\nfeeling as if his bosom had been suddenly left empty and hollow, and the\nweight of the whole world was crushing in its walls. The next evening,\nfor the first time since she began to come, she came not.\n\nAnd now Cosmo was in wretched plight. Since the thought of a rival\nhad occurred to him, he could not rest for a moment. More than ever he\nlonged to see the lady face to face. He persuaded himself that if he but\nknew the worst he would be satisfied; for then he could abandon Prague,\nand find that relief in constant motion, which is the hope of all active\nminds when invaded by distress. Meantime he waited with unspeakable\nanxiety for the next night, hoping she would return: but she did not\nappear. And now he fell really ill. Rallied by his fellow students on\nhis wretched looks, he ceased to attend the lectures. His engagements\nwere neglected. He cared for nothing. The sky, with the great sun in it,\nwas to him a heartless, burning desert. The men and women in the streets\nwere mere puppets, without motives in themselves, or interest to him. He\nsaw them all as on the ever-changing field of a camera obscura. She--she\nalone and altogether--was his universe, his well of life, his incarnate\ngood. For six evenings she came not. Let his absorbing passion, and\nthe slow fever that was consuming his brain, be his excuse for the\nresolution which he had taken and begun to execute, before that time had\nexpired.\n\nReasoning with himself, that it must be by some enchantment connected\nwith the mirror, that the form of the lady was to be seen in it, he\ndetermined to attempt to turn to account what he had hitherto studied\nprincipally from curiosity. “For,” said he to himself, “if a spell can\nforce her presence in that glass (and she came unwillingly at first),\nmay not a stronger spell, such as I know, especially with the aid of\nher half-presence in the mirror, if ever she appears again, compel\nher living form to come to me here? If I do her wrong, let love be\nmy excuse. I want only to know my doom from her own lips.” He never\ndoubted, all the time, that she was a real earthly woman; or, rather,\nthat there was a woman, who, somehow or other, threw this reflection of\nher form into the magic mirror.\n\nHe opened his secret drawer, took out his books of magic, lighted his\nlamp, and read and made notes from midnight till three in the morning,\nfor three successive nights. Then he replaced his books; and the next\nnight went out in quest of the materials necessary for the conjuration.\nThese were not easy to find; for, in love-charms and all incantations of\nthis nature, ingredients are employed scarcely fit to be mentioned,\nand for the thought even of which, in connexion with her, he could only\nexcuse himself on the score of his bitter need. At length he succeeded\nin procuring all he required; and on the seventh evening from that on\nwhich she had last appeared, he found himself prepared for the exercise\nof unlawful and tyrannical power.\n\nHe cleared the centre of the room; stooped and drew a circle of red on\nthe floor, around the spot where he stood; wrote in the four quarters\nmystical signs, and numbers which were all powers of seven or nine;\nexamined the whole ring carefully, to see that no smallest break had\noccurred in the circumference; and then rose from his bending posture.\nAs he rose, the church clock struck seven; and, just as she had appeared\nthe first time, reluctant, slow, and stately, glided in the lady. Cosmo\ntrembled; and when, turning, she revealed a countenance worn and wan, as\nwith sickness or inward trouble, he grew faint, and felt as if he dared\nnot proceed. But as he gazed on the face and form, which now possessed\nhis whole soul, to the exclusion of all other joys and griefs, the\nlonging to speak to her, to know that she heard him, to hear from her\none word in return, became so unendurable, that he suddenly and hastily\nresumed his preparations. Stepping carefully from the circle, he put\na small brazier into its centre. He then set fire to its contents of\ncharcoal, and while it burned up, opened his window and seated himself,\nwaiting, beside it.\n\nIt was a sultry evening. The air was full of thunder. A sense of\nluxurious depression filled the brain. The sky seemed to have grown\nheavy, and to compress the air beneath it. A kind of purplish tinge\npervaded the atmosphere, and through the open window came the scents of\nthe distant fields, which all the vapours of the city could not quench.\nSoon the charcoal glowed. Cosmo sprinkled upon it the incense and other\nsubstances which he had compounded, and, stepping within the circle,\nturned his face from the brazier and towards the mirror. Then, fixing\nhis eyes upon the face of the lady, he began with a trembling voice to\nrepeat a powerful incantation. He had not gone far, before the lady grew\npale; and then, like a returning wave, the blood washed all its banks\nwith its crimson tide, and she hid her face in her hands. Then he passed\nto a conjuration stronger yet.\n\nThe lady rose and walked uneasily to and fro in her room. Another spell;\nand she seemed seeking with her eyes for some object on which they\nwished to rest. At length it seemed as if she suddenly espied him;\nfor her eyes fixed themselves full and wide upon his, and she drew\ngradually, and somewhat unwillingly, close to her side of the mirror,\njust as if his eyes had fascinated her. Cosmo had never seen her so near\nbefore. Now at least, eyes met eyes; but he could not quite understand\nthe expression of hers. They were full of tender entreaty, but there was\nsomething more that he could not interpret. Though his heart seemed to\nlabour in his throat, he would allow no delight or agitation to turn him\nfrom his task. Looking still in her face, he passed on to the mightiest\ncharm he knew. Suddenly the lady turned and walked out of the door\nof her reflected chamber. A moment after she entered his room with\nveritable presence; and, forgetting all his precautions, he sprang from\nthe charmed circle, and knelt before her. There she stood, the living\nlady of his passionate visions, alone beside him, in a thundery\ntwilight, and the glow of a magic fire.\n\n“Why,” said the lady, with a trembling voice, “didst thou bring a poor\nmaiden through the rainy streets alone?”\n\n“Because I am dying for love of thee; but I only brought thee from the\nmirror there.”\n\n“Ah, the mirror!” and she looked up at it, and shuddered. “Alas! I am\nbut a slave, while that mirror exists. But do not think it was the power\nof thy spells that drew me; it was thy longing desire to see me, that\nbeat at the door of my heart, till I was forced to yield.”\n\n“Canst thou love me then?” said Cosmo, in a voice calm as death, but\nalmost inarticulate with emotion.\n\n“I do not know,” she replied sadly; “that I cannot tell, so long as I am\nbewildered with enchantments. It were indeed a joy too great, to lay my\nhead on thy bosom and weep to death; for I think thou lovest me, though\nI do not know;--but----”\n\nCosmo rose from his knees.\n\n“I love thee as--nay, I know not what--for since I have loved thee,\nthere is nothing else.”\n\nHe seized her hand: she withdrew it.\n\n“No, better not; I am in thy power, and therefore I may not.”\n\nShe burst into tears, and kneeling before him in her turn, said--\n\n“Cosmo, if thou lovest me, set me free, even from thyself; break the\nmirror.”\n\n“And shall I see thyself instead?”\n\n“That I cannot tell, I will not deceive thee; we may never meet again.”\n\nA fierce struggle arose in Cosmo’s bosom. Now she was in his power. She\ndid not dislike him at least; and he could see her when he would. To\nbreak the mirror would be to destroy his very life to banish out of his\nuniverse the only glory it possessed. The whole world would be but a\nprison, if he annihilated the one window that looked into the paradise\nof love. Not yet pure in love, he hesitated.\n\nWith a wail of sorrow the lady rose to her feet. “Ah! he loves me not;\nhe loves me not even as I love him; and alas! I care more for his love\nthan even for the freedom I ask.”\n\n“I will not wait to be willing,” cried Cosmo; and sprang to the corner\nwhere the great sword stood.\n\nMeantime it had grown very dark; only the embers cast a red glow through\nthe room. He seized the sword by the steel scabbard, and stood before\nthe mirror; but as he heaved a great blow at it with the heavy pommel,\nthe blade slipped half-way out of the scabbard, and the pommel struck\nthe wall above the mirror. At that moment, a terrible clap of thunder\nseemed to burst in the very room beside them; and ere Cosmo could repeat\nthe blow, he fell senseless on the hearth. When he came to himself, he\nfound that the lady and the mirror had both disappeared. He was seized\nwith a brain fever, which kept him to his couch for weeks.\n\nWhen he recovered his reason, he began to think what could have become\nof the mirror. For the lady, he hoped she had found her way back as\nshe came; but as the mirror involved her fate with its own, he was more\nimmediately anxious about that. He could not think she had carried it\naway. It was much too heavy, even if it had not been too firmly fixed in\nthe wall, for her to remove it. Then again, he remembered the thunder;\nwhich made him believe that it was not the lightning, but some other\nblow that had struck him down. He concluded that, either by supernatural\nagency, he having exposed himself to the vengeance of the demons in\nleaving the circle of safety, or in some other mode, the mirror had\nprobably found its way back to its former owner; and, horrible to think\nof, might have been by this time once more disposed of, delivering up\nthe lady into the power of another man; who, if he used his power no\nworse than he himself had done, might yet give Cosmo abundant cause to\ncurse the selfish indecision which prevented him from shattering the\nmirror at once. Indeed, to think that she whom he loved, and who had\nprayed to him for freedom, should be still at the mercy, in some degree,\nof the possessor of the mirror, and was at least exposed to his constant\nobservation, was in itself enough to madden a chary lover.\n\nAnxiety to be well retarded his recovery; but at length he was able to\ncreep abroad. He first made his way to the old broker’s, pretending to\nbe in search of something else. A laughing sneer on the creature’s face\nconvinced him that he knew all about it; but he could not see it amongst\nhis furniture, or get any information out of him as to what had become\nof it. He expressed the utmost surprise at hearing it had been stolen, a\nsurprise which Cosmo saw at once to be counterfeited; while, at the same\ntime, he fancied that the old wretch was not at all anxious to have it\nmistaken for genuine. Full of distress, which he concealed as well as he\ncould, he made many searches, but with no avail. Of course he could\nask no questions; but he kept his ears awake for any remotest hint that\nmight set him in a direction of search. He never went out without a\nshort heavy hammer of steel about him, that he might shatter the mirror\nthe moment he was made happy by the sight of his lost treasure, if ever\nthat blessed moment should arrive. Whether he should see the lady again,\nwas now a thought altogether secondary, and postponed to the achievement\nof her freedom. He wandered here and there, like an anxious ghost, pale\nand haggard; gnawed ever at the heart, by the thought of what she might\nbe suffering--all from his fault.\n\nOne night, he mingled with a crowd that filled the rooms of one of\nthe most distinguished mansions in the city; for he accepted every\ninvitation, that he might lose no chance, however poor, of obtaining\nsome information that might expedite his discovery. Here he wandered\nabout, listening to every stray word that he could catch, in the hope of\na revelation. As he approached some ladies who were talking quietly in a\ncorner, one said to another:\n\n“Have you heard of the strange illness of the Princess von Hohenweiss?”\n\n“Yes; she has been ill for more than a year now. It is very sad for so\nfine a creature to have such a terrible malady. She was better for\nsome weeks lately, but within the last few days the same attacks have\nreturned, apparently accompanied with more suffering than ever. It is\naltogether an inexplicable story.”\n\n“Is there a story connected with her illness?”\n\n“I have only heard imperfect reports of it; but it is said that she gave\noffence some eighteen months ago to an old woman who had held an\noffice of trust in the family, and who, after some incoherent threats,\ndisappeared. This peculiar affection followed soon after. But the\nstrangest part of the story is its association with the loss of an\nantique mirror, which stood in her dressing-room, and of which she\nconstantly made use.”\n\nHere the speaker’s voice sank to a whisper; and Cosmo, although his very\nsoul sat listening in his ears, could hear no more. He trembled too much\nto dare to address the ladies, even if it had been advisable to expose\nhimself to their curiosity. The name of the Princess was well known to\nhim, but he had never seen her; except indeed it was she, which now he\nhardly doubted, who had knelt before him on that dreadful night. Fearful\nof attracting attention, for, from the weak state of his health, he\ncould not recover an appearance of calmness, he made his way to the open\nair, and reached his lodgings; glad in this, that he at least knew where\nshe lived, although he never dreamed of approaching her openly, even\nif he should be happy enough to free her from her hateful bondage. He\nhoped, too, that as he had unexpectedly learned so much, the other and\nfar more important part might be revealed to him ere long.\n\n\n*****\n\n\n“Have you seen Steinwald lately?”\n\n“No, I have not seen him for some time. He is almost a match for me at\nthe rapier, and I suppose he thinks he needs no more lessons.”\n\n“I wonder what has become of him. I want to see him very much. Let me\nsee; the last time I saw him he was coming out of that old broker’s\nden, to which, if you remember, you accompanied me once, to look at some\narmour. That is fully three weeks ago.”\n\nThis hint was enough for Cosmo. Von Steinwald was a man of influence in\nthe court, well known for his reckless habits and fierce passions. The\nvery possibility that the mirror should be in his possession was hell\nitself to Cosmo. But violent or hasty measures of any sort were most\nunlikely to succeed. All that he wanted was an opportunity of breaking\nthe fatal glass; and to obtain this he must bide his time. He revolved\nmany plans in his mind, but without being able to fix upon any.\n\nAt length, one evening, as he was passing the house of Von Steinwald, he\nsaw the windows more than usually brilliant. He watched for a while,\nand seeing that company began to arrive, hastened home, and dressed\nas richly as he could, in the hope of mingling with the guests\nunquestioned: in effecting which, there could be no difficulty for a man\nof his carriage.\n\n*****\n\nIn a lofty, silent chamber, in another part of the city, lay a form more\nlike marble than a living woman. The loveliness of death seemed frozen\nupon her face, for her lips were rigid, and her eyelids closed. Her long\nwhite hands were crossed over her breast, and no breathing disturbed\ntheir repose. Beside the dead, men speak in whispers, as if the deepest\nrest of all could be broken by the sound of a living voice. Just so,\nthough the soul was evidently beyond the reach of all intimations from\nthe senses, the two ladies, who sat beside her, spoke in the gentlest\ntones of subdued sorrow. “She has lain so for an hour.”\n\n“This cannot last long, I fear.”\n\n“How much thinner she has grown within the last few weeks! If she would\nonly speak, and explain what she suffers, it would be better for her.\nI think she has visions in her trances, but nothing can induce her to\nrefer to them when she is awake.”\n\n“Does she ever speak in these trances?”\n\n“I have never heard her; but they say she walks sometimes, and once put\nthe whole household in a terrible fright by disappearing for a whole\nhour, and returning drenched with rain, and almost dead with exhaustion\nand fright. But even then she would give no account of what had\nhappened.”\n\nA scarce audible murmur from the yet motionless lips of the lady\nhere startled her attendants. After several ineffectual attempts at\narticulation, the word “COSMO!” burst from her. Then she lay still as\nbefore; but only for a moment. With a wild cry, she sprang from the\ncouch erect on the floor, flung her arms above her head, with clasped\nand straining hands, and, her wide eyes flashing with light, called\naloud, with a voice exultant as that of a spirit bursting from a\nsepulchre, “I am free! I am free! I thank thee!” Then she flung herself\non the couch, and sobbed; then rose, and paced wildly up and down the\nroom, with gestures of mingled delight and anxiety. Then turning to her\nmotionless attendants--“Quick, Lisa, my cloak and hood!” Then lower--“I\nmust go to him. Make haste, Lisa! You may come with me, if you will.”\n\nIn another moment they were in the street, hurrying along towards one\nof the bridges over the Moldau. The moon was near the zenith, and the\nstreets were almost empty. The Princess soon outstripped her attendant,\nand was half-way over the bridge, before the other reached it.\n\n“Are you free, lady? The mirror is broken: are you free?”\n\nThe words were spoken close beside her, as she hurried on. She turned;\nand there, leaning on the parapet in a recess of the bridge, stood\nCosmo, in a splendid dress, but with a white and quivering face.\n\n“Cosmo!--I am free--and thy servant for ever. I was coming to you now.”\n\n“And I to you, for Death made me bold; but I could get no further. Have\nI atoned at all? Do I love you a little--truly?”\n\n“Ah, I know now that you love me, my Cosmo; but what do you say about\ndeath?”\n\nHe did not reply. His hand was pressed against his side. She looked more\nclosely: the blood was welling from between the fingers. She flung her\narms around him with a faint bitter wail.\n\nWhen Lisa came up, she found her mistress kneeling above a wan dead\nface, which smiled on in the spectral moonbeams.\n\n And now I will say no more about these wondrous volumes; though\nI could tell many a tale out of them, and could, perhaps, vaguely\nrepresent some entrancing thoughts of a deeper kind which I found within\nthem. From many a sultry noon till twilight, did I sit in that grand\nhall, buried and risen again in these old books. And I trust I have\ncarried away in my soul some of the exhalations of their undying leaves.\nIn after hours of deserved or needful sorrow, portions of what I read\nthere have often come to me again, with an unexpected comforting;\nwhich was not fruitless, even though the comfort might seem in itself\ngroundless and vain.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n                                         “Your gallery\n             Ha we pass’d through, not without much content\n             In many singularities; but we saw not\n             That which my daughter came to look upon,\n             The state of her mother.”\n                                      Winter’s Tale.\n\nIt seemed to me strange, that all this time I had heard no music in the\nfairy palace. I was convinced there must be music in it, but that my\nsense was as yet too gross to receive the influence of those mysterious\nmotions that beget sound. Sometimes I felt sure, from the way the few\nfigures of which I got such transitory glimpses passed me, or glided\ninto vacancy before me, that they were moving to the law of music;\nand, in fact, several times I fancied for a moment that I heard a few\nwondrous tones coming I knew not whence. But they did not last long\nenough to convince me that I had heard them with the bodily sense. Such\nas they were, however, they took strange liberties with me, causing me\nto burst suddenly into tears, of which there was no presence to make\nme ashamed, or casting me into a kind of trance of speechless delight,\nwhich, passing as suddenly, left me faint and longing for more.\n\nNow, on an evening, before I had been a week in the palace, I was\nwandering through one lighted arcade and corridor after another. At\nlength I arrived, through a door that closed behind me, in another vast\nhall of the palace. It was filled with a subdued crimson light; by\nwhich I saw that slender pillars of black, built close to walls of white\nmarble, rose to a great height, and then, dividing into innumerable\ndivergent arches, supported a roof, like the walls, of white marble,\nupon which the arches intersected intricately, forming a fretting of\nblack upon the white, like the network of a skeleton-leaf. The floor was\nblack.\n\nBetween several pairs of the pillars upon every side, the place of the\nwall behind was occupied by a crimson curtain of thick silk, hanging in\nheavy and rich folds. Behind each of these curtains burned a powerful\nlight, and these were the sources of the glow that filled the hall. A\npeculiar delicious odour pervaded the place. As soon as I entered, the\nold inspiration seemed to return to me, for I felt a strong impulse to\nsing; or rather, it seemed as if some one else was singing a song in my\nsoul, which wanted to come forth at my lips, imbodied in my breath. But\nI kept silence; and feeling somewhat overcome by the red light and the\nperfume, as well as by the emotion within me, and seeing at one end of\nthe hall a great crimson chair, more like a throne than a chair, beside\na table of white marble, I went to it, and, throwing myself in it, gave\nmyself up to a succession of images of bewildering beauty, which passed\nbefore my inward eye, in a long and occasionally crowded train. Here I\nsat for hours, I suppose; till, returning somewhat to myself, I saw that\nthe red light had paled away, and felt a cool gentle breath gliding over\nmy forehead. I rose and left the hall with unsteady steps, finding my\nway with some difficulty to my own chamber, and faintly remembering,\nas I went, that only in the marble cave, before I found the sleeping\nstatue, had I ever had a similar experience.\n\nAfter this, I repaired every morning to the same hall; where I sometimes\nsat in the chair and dreamed deliciously, and sometimes walked up and\ndown over the black floor. Sometimes I acted within myself a whole\ndrama, during one of these perambulations; sometimes walked deliberately\nthrough the whole epic of a tale; sometimes ventured to sing a song,\nthough with a shrinking fear of I knew not what. I was astonished at\nthe beauty of my own voice as it rang through the place, or rather crept\nundulating, like a serpent of sound, along the walls and roof of this\nsuperb music-hall. Entrancing verses arose within me as of their own\naccord, chanting themselves to their own melodies, and requiring no\naddition of music to satisfy the inward sense. But, ever in the pauses\nof these, when the singing mood was upon me, I seemed to hear something\nlike the distant sound of multitudes of dancers, and felt as if it\nwas the unheard music, moving their rhythmic motion, that within me\nblossomed in verse and song. I felt, too, that could I but see the\ndance, I should, from the harmony of complicated movements, not of\nthe dancers in relation to each other merely, but of each dancer\nindividually in the manifested plastic power that moved the consenting\nharmonious form, understand the whole of the music on the billows of\nwhich they floated and swung.\n\nAt length, one night, suddenly, when this feeling of dancing came upon\nme, I bethought me of lifting one of the crimson curtains, and looking\nif, perchance, behind it there might not be hid some other mystery,\nwhich might at least remove a step further the bewilderment of the\npresent one. Nor was I altogether disappointed. I walked to one of the\nmagnificent draperies, lifted a corner, and peeped in. There, burned\na great, crimson, globe-shaped light, high in the cubical centre of\nanother hall, which might be larger or less than that in which I stood,\nfor its dimensions were not easily perceived, seeing that floor and roof\nand walls were entirely of black marble.\n\nThe roof was supported by the same arrangement of pillars radiating in\narches, as that of the first hall; only, here, the pillars and\narches were of dark red. But what absorbed my delighted gaze, was an\ninnumerable assembly of white marble statues, of every form, and in\nmultitudinous posture, filling the hall throughout. These stood, in the\nruddy glow of the great lamp, upon pedestals of jet black. Around the\nlamp shone in golden letters, plainly legible from where I stood, the\ntwo words--\n\n                     TOUCH NOT!\n\nThere was in all this, however, no solution to the sound of dancing; and\nnow I was aware that the influence on my mind had ceased. I did not\ngo in that evening, for I was weary and faint, but I hoarded up the\nexpectation of entering, as of a great coming joy.\n\nNext night I walked, as on the preceding, through the hall. My mind was\nfilled with pictures and songs, and therewith so much absorbed, that\nI did not for some time think of looking within the curtain I had last\nnight lifted. When the thought of doing so occurred to me first, I\nhappened to be within a few yards of it. I became conscious, at the same\nmoment, that the sound of dancing had been for some time in my ears. I\napproached the curtain quickly, and, lifting it, entered the black hall.\nEverything was still as death. I should have concluded that the\nsound must have proceeded from some other more distant quarter,\nwhich conclusion its faintness would, in ordinary circumstances, have\nnecessitated from the first; but there was a something about the statues\nthat caused me still to remain in doubt. As I said, each stood perfectly\nstill upon its black pedestal: but there was about every one a certain\nair, not of motion, but as if it had just ceased from movement; as if\nthe rest were not altogether of the marbly stillness of thousands of\nyears. It was as if the peculiar atmosphere of each had yet a kind\nof invisible tremulousness; as if its agitated wavelets had not\nyet subsided into a perfect calm. I had the suspicion that they had\nanticipated my appearance, and had sprung, each, from the living joy of\nthe dance, to the death-silence and blackness of its isolated pedestal,\njust before I entered. I walked across the central hall to the curtain\nopposite the one I had lifted, and, entering there, found all the\nappearances similar; only that the statues were different, and\ndifferently grouped. Neither did they produce on my mind that\nimpression--of motion just expired, which I had experienced from the\nothers. I found that behind every one of the crimson curtains was a\nsimilar hall, similarly lighted, and similarly occupied.\n\nThe next night, I did not allow my thoughts to be absorbed as before\nwith inward images, but crept stealthily along to the furthest curtain\nin the hall, from behind which, likewise, I had formerly seemed to hear\nthe sound of dancing. I drew aside its edge as suddenly as I could, and,\nlooking in, saw that the utmost stillness pervaded the vast place. I\nwalked in, and passed through it to the other end.\n\nThere I found that it communicated with a circular corridor, divided\nfrom it only by two rows of red columns. This corridor, which was black,\nwith red niches holding statues, ran entirely about the statue-halls,\nforming a communication between the further ends of them all; further,\nthat is, as regards the central hall of white whence they all diverged\nlike radii, finding their circumference in the corridor.\n\nRound this corridor I now went, entering all the halls, of which there\nwere twelve, and finding them all similarly constructed, but filled with\nquite various statues, of what seemed both ancient and modern sculpture.\nAfter I had simply walked through them, I found myself sufficiently\ntired to long for rest, and went to my own room.\n\nIn the night I dreamed that, walking close by one of the curtains, I was\nsuddenly seized with the desire to enter, and darted in. This time I was\ntoo quick for them. All the statues were in motion, statues no longer,\nbut men and women--all shapes of beauty that ever sprang from the brain\nof the sculptor, mingled in the convolutions of a complicated dance.\nPassing through them to the further end, I almost started from my\nsleep on beholding, not taking part in the dance with the others, nor\nseemingly endued with life like them, but standing in marble coldness\nand rigidity upon a black pedestal in the extreme left corner--my lady\nof the cave; the marble beauty who sprang from her tomb or her cradle\nat the call of my songs. While I gazed in speechless astonishment and\nadmiration, a dark shadow, descending from above like the curtain of a\nstage, gradually hid her entirely from my view. I felt with a shudder\nthat this shadow was perchance my missing demon, whom I had not seen for\ndays. I awoke with a stifled cry.\n\nOf course, the next evening I began my journey through the halls (for I\nknew not to which my dream had carried me), in the hope of proving the\ndream to be a true one, by discovering my marble beauty upon her black\npedestal. At length, on reaching the tenth hall, I thought I\nrecognised some of the forms I had seen dancing in my dream; and to my\nbewilderment, when I arrived at the extreme corner on the left, there\nstood, the only one I had yet seen, a vacant pedestal. It was exactly in\nthe position occupied, in my dream, by the pedestal on which the white\nlady stood. Hope beat violently in my heart.\n\n“Now,” said I to myself, “if yet another part of the dream would but\ncome true, and I should succeed in surprising these forms in their\nnightly dance; it might be the rest would follow, and I should see on\nthe pedestal my marble queen. Then surely if my songs sufficed to give\nher life before, when she lay in the bonds of alabaster, much more would\nthey be sufficient then to give her volition and motion, when she alone\nof assembled crowds of marble forms, would be standing rigid and cold.”\n\nBut the difficulty was, to surprise the dancers. I had found that a\npremeditated attempt at surprise, though executed with the utmost care\nand rapidity, was of no avail. And, in my dream, it was effected by a\nsudden thought suddenly executed. I saw, therefore, that there was no\nplan of operation offering any probability of success, but this: to\nallow my mind to be occupied with other thoughts, as I wandered around\nthe great centre-hall; and so wait till the impulse to enter one of the\nothers should happen to arise in me just at the moment when I was close\nto one of the crimson curtains. For I hoped that if I entered any one of\nthe twelve halls at the right moment, that would as it were give me the\nright of entrance to all the others, seeing they all had communication\nbehind. I would not diminish the hope of the right chance, by supposing\nit necessary that a desire to enter should awake within me, precisely\nwhen I was close to the curtains of the tenth hall.\n\nAt first the impulses to see recurred so continually, in spite of the\ncrowded imagery that kept passing through my mind, that they formed\ntoo nearly a continuous chain, for the hope that any one of them would\nsucceed as a surprise. But as I persisted in banishing them, they\nrecurred less and less often; and after two or three, at considerable\nintervals, had come when the spot where I happened to be was unsuitable,\nthe hope strengthened, that soon one might arise just at the right\nmoment; namely, when, in walking round the hall, I should be close to\none of the curtains.\n\nAt length the right moment and the impulse coincided. I darted into the\nninth hall. It was full of the most exquisite moving forms. The whole\nspace wavered and swam with the involutions of an intricate dance. It\nseemed to break suddenly as I entered, and all made one or two bounds\ntowards their pedestals; but, apparently on finding that they were\nthoroughly overtaken, they returned to their employment (for it seemed\nwith them earnest enough to be called such) without further heeding\nme. Somewhat impeded by the floating crowd, I made what haste I could\ntowards the bottom of the hall; whence, entering the corridor, I turned\ntowards the tenth. I soon arrived at the corner I wanted to reach, for\nthe corridor was comparatively empty; but, although the dancers here,\nafter a little confusion, altogether disregarded my presence, I\nwas dismayed at beholding, even yet, a vacant pedestal. But I had a\nconviction that she was near me. And as I looked at the pedestal, I\nthought I saw upon it, vaguely revealed as if through overlapping folds\nof drapery, the indistinct outlines of white feet. Yet there was no\nsign of drapery or concealing shadow whatever. But I remembered the\ndescending shadow in my dream. And I hoped still in the power of my\nsongs; thinking that what could dispel alabaster, might likewise be\ncapable of dispelling what concealed my beauty now, even if it were the\ndemon whose darkness had overshadowed all my life.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n              “Alexander. ‘When will you finish Campaspe?’\n               Apelles.  ‘Never finish: for always in absolute\n               beauty there is somewhat above art.’”\n                                           LYLY’S Campaspe.\n\nAnd now, what song should I sing to unveil my Isis, if indeed she was\npresent unseen? I hurried away to the white hall of Phantasy, heedless\nof the innumerable forms of beauty that crowded my way: these might\ncross my eyes, but the unseen filled my brain. I wandered long, up and\ndown the silent space: no songs came. My soul was not still enough for\nsongs. Only in the silence and darkness of the soul’s night, do those\nstars of the inward firmament sink to its lower surface from the singing\nrealms beyond, and shine upon the conscious spirit. Here all effort was\nunavailing. If they came not, they could not be found.\n\nNext night, it was just the same. I walked through the red glimmer of\nthe silent hall; but lonely as there I walked, as lonely trod my soul\nup and down the halls of the brain. At last I entered one of the\nstatue-halls. The dance had just commenced, and I was delighted to find\nthat I was free of their assembly. I walked on till I came to the sacred\ncorner. There I found the pedestal just as I had left it, with the faint\nglimmer as of white feet still resting on the dead black. As soon as I\nsaw it, I seemed to feel a presence which longed to become visible; and,\nas it were, called to me to gift it with self-manifestation, that it\nmight shine on me. The power of song came to me. But the moment my\nvoice, though I sang low and soft, stirred the air of the hall, the\ndancers started; the quick interweaving crowd shook, lost its form,\ndivided; each figure sprang to its pedestal, and stood, a self-evolving\nlife no more, but a rigid, life-like, marble shape, with the whole form\ncomposed into the expression of a single state or act. Silence rolled\nlike a spiritual thunder through the grand space. My song had ceased,\nscared at its own influences. But I saw in the hand of one of the\nstatues close by me, a harp whose chords yet quivered. I remembered\nthat as she bounded past me, her harp had brushed against my arm; so\nthe spell of the marble had not infolded it. I sprang to her, and with a\ngesture of entreaty, laid my hand on the harp. The marble hand, probably\nfrom its contact with the uncharmed harp, had strength enough to relax\nits hold, and yield the harp to me. No other motion indicated life.\nInstinctively I struck the chords and sang. And not to break upon the\nrecord of my song, I mention here, that as I sang the first four lines,\nthe loveliest feet became clear upon the black pedestal; and ever as I\nsang, it was as if a veil were being lifted up from before the form, but\nan invisible veil, so that the statue appeared to grow before me, not\nso much by evolution, as by infinitesimal degrees of added height. And,\nwhile I sang, I did not feel that I stood by a statue, as indeed it\nappeared to be, but that a real woman-soul was revealing itself by\nsuccessive stages of imbodiment, and consequent manifestatlon and\nexpression.\n\n        Feet of beauty, firmly planting\n             Arches white on rosy heel!\n         Whence the life-spring, throbbing, panting,\n             Pulses upward to reveal!\n         Fairest things know least despising;\n             Foot and earth meet tenderly:\n         ‘Tis the woman, resting, rising\n             Upward to sublimity,\n         Rise the limbs, sedately sloping,\n             Strong and gentle, full and free;\n         Soft and slow, like certain hoping,\n             Drawing nigh the broad firm knee.\n         Up to speech!

This ability came\nsolely from the state of mental elevation in which I found myself. Only\nbecause uplifted in song, was I able to endure the blaze of the dawn.\nBut I cannot tell whether she looked more of statue or more of woman;\nshe seemed removed into that region of phantasy where all is intensely\nvivid, but nothing clearly defined. At last, as I sang of her descending\nhair, the glow of soul faded away, like a dying sunset. A lamp within\nhad been extinguished, and the house of life shone blank in a winter\nmorn. She was a statue once more--but visible, and that was much gained.\nYet the revulsion from hope and fruition was such, that, unable to\nrestrain myself, I sprang to her, and, in defiance of the law of the\nplace, flung my arms around her, as if I would tear her from the grasp\nof a visible Death, and lifted her from the pedestal down to my heart.\nBut no sooner had her feet ceased to be in contact with the black\npedestal, than she shuddered and trembled all over; then, writhing\nfrom my arms, before I could tighten their hold, she sprang into the\ncorridor, with the reproachful cry, “You should not have touched\nme!” darted behind one of the exterior pillars of the circle, and\ndisappeared. I followed almost as fast; but ere I could reach the\npillar, the sound of a closing door, the saddest of all sounds\nsometimes, fell on my ear; and, arriving at the spot where she had\nvanished, I saw, lighted by a pale yellow lamp which hung above it,\na heavy, rough door, altogether unlike any others I had seen in\nthe palace; for they were all of ebony, or ivory, or covered with\nsilver-plates, or of some odorous wood, and very ornate; whereas this\nseemed of old oak, with heavy nails and iron studs. Notwithstanding the\nprecipitation of my pursuit, I could not help reading, in silver letters\nbeneath the lamp: “NO ONE ENTERS HERE WITHOUT THE LEAVE OF THE QUEEN.”\n But what was the Queen to me, when I followed my white lady? I dashed\nthe door to the wall and sprang through. Lo! I stood on a waste windy\nhill. Great stones like tombstones stood all about me. No door, no\npalace was to be seen. A white figure gleamed past me, wringing her\nhands, and crying, “Ah! you should have sung to me; you should have sung\nto me!” and disappeared behind one of the stones. I followed. A cold\ngust of wind met me from behind the stone; and when I looked, I saw\nnothing but a great hole in the earth, into which I could find no way\nof entering. Had she fallen in? I could not tell. I must wait for the\ndaylight. I sat down and wept, for there was no help.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n         “First, I thought, almost despairing,\n             This must crush my spirit now;\n          Yet I bore it, and am bearing--\n             Only do not ask me how.”\n                              HEINE.\n\nWhen the daylight came, it brought the possibility of action, but with\nit little of consolation. With the first visible increase of light,\nI gazed into the chasm, but could not, for more than an hour, see\nsufficiently well to discover its nature. At last I saw it was almost a\nperpendicular opening, like a roughly excavated well, only very large.\nI could perceive no bottom; and it was not till the sun actually rose,\nthat I discovered a sort of natural staircase, in many parts little more\nthan suggested, which led round and round the gulf, descending spirally\ninto its abyss. I saw at once that this was my path; and without a\nmoment’s hesitation, glad to quit the sunlight, which stared at me most\nheartlessly, I commenced my tortuous descent. It was very difficult.\nIn some parts I had to cling to the rocks like a bat. In one place, I\ndropped from the track down upon the next returning spire of the stair;\nwhich being broad in this particular portion, and standing out from the\nwall at right angles, received me upon my feet safe, though somewhat\nstupefied by the shock. After descending a great way, I found the stair\nended at a narrow opening which entered the rock horizontally. Into this\nI crept, and, having entered, had just room to turn round. I put my head\nout into the shaft by which I had come down, and surveyed the course of\nmy descent. Looking up, I saw the stars; although the sun must by this\ntime have been high in the heavens. Looking below, I saw that the sides\nof the shaft went sheer down, smooth as glass; and far beneath me, I saw\nthe reflection of the same stars I had seen in the heavens when I looked\nup. I turned again, and crept inwards some distance, when the passage\nwidened, and I was at length able to stand and walk upright. Wider and\nloftier grew the way; new paths branched off on every side; great open\nhalls appeared; till at last I found myself wandering on through an\nunderground country, in which the sky was of rock, and instead of trees\nand flowers, there were only fantastic rocks and stones. And ever as I\nwent, darker grew my thoughts, till at last I had no hope whatever of\nfinding the white lady: I no longer called her to myself MY white lady.\nWhenever a choice was necessary, I always chose the path which seemed to\nlead downwards.\n\nAt length I began to find that these regions were inhabited. From behind\na rock a peal of harsh grating laughter, full of evil humour, rang\nthrough my ears, and, looking round, I saw a queer, goblin creature,\nwith a great head and ridiculous features, just such as those described,\nin German histories and travels, as Kobolds. “What do you want with me?”\n I said. He pointed at me with a long forefinger, very thick at the root,\nand sharpened to a point, and answered, “He! he! he! what do YOU\nwant here?” Then, changing his tone, he continued, with mock\nhumility--“Honoured sir, vouchsafe to withdraw from thy slaves the\nlustre of thy august presence, for thy slaves cannot support its\nbrightness.” A second appeared, and struck in: “You are so big, you keep\nthe sun from us. We can’t see for you, and we’re so cold.” Thereupon\narose, on all sides, the most terrific uproar of laughter, from voices\nlike those of children in volume, but scrannel and harsh as those of\ndecrepit age, though, unfortunately, without its weakness. The whole\npandemonium of fairy devils, of all varieties of fantastic ugliness,\nboth in form and feature, and of all sizes from one to four feet, seemed\nto have suddenly assembled about me. At length, after a great babble of\ntalk among themselves, in a language unknown to me, and after seemingly\nendless gesticulation, consultation, elbow-nudging, and unmitigated\npeals of laughter, they formed into a circle about one of their number,\nwho scrambled upon a stone, and, much to my surprise, and somewhat to\nmy dismay, began to sing, in a voice corresponding in its nature to his\ntalking one, from beginning to end, the song with which I had brought\nthe light into the eyes of the white lady. He sang the same air too;\nand, all the time, maintained a face of mock entreaty and worship;\naccompanying the song with the travestied gestures of one playing on\nthe lute. The whole assembly kept silence, except at the close of every\nverse, when they roared, and danced, and shouted with laughter, and\nflung themselves on the ground, in real or pretended convulsions of\ndelight. When he had finished, the singer threw himself from the top\nof the stone, turning heels over head several times in his descent; and\nwhen he did alight, it was on the top of his head, on which he hopped\nabout, making the most grotesque gesticulations with his legs in the\nair. Inexpressible laughter followed, which broke up in a shower of\ntiny stones from innumerable hands. They could not materially injure me,\nalthough they cut me on the head and face. I attempted to run away, but\nthey all rushed upon me, and, laying hold of every part that afforded\na grasp, held me tight. Crowding about me like bees, they shouted an\ninsect-swarm of exasperating speeches up into my face, among which the\nmost frequently recurring were--“You shan’t have her; you shan’t have\nher; he! he! he! She’s for a better man; how he’ll kiss her! how he’ll\nkiss her!”\n\nThe galvanic torrent of this battery of malevolence stung to life within\nme a spark of nobleness, and I said aloud, “Well, if he is a better man,\nlet him have her.”\n\nThey instantly let go their hold of me, and fell back a step or two,\nwith a whole broadside of grunts and humphs, as of unexpected and\ndisappointed approbation. I made a step or two forward, and a lane was\ninstantly opened for me through the midst of the grinning little antics,\nwho bowed most politely to me on every side as I passed. After I had\ngone a few yards, I looked back, and saw them all standing quite still,\nlooking after me, like a great school of boys; till suddenly one turned\nround, and with a loud whoop, rushed into the midst of the others. In\nan instant, the whole was one writhing and tumbling heap of contortion,\nreminding me of the live pyramids of intertwined snakes of which\ntravellers make report. As soon as one was worked out of the mass, he\nbounded off a few paces, and then, with a somersault and a run, threw\nhimself gyrating into the air, and descended with all his weight on the\nsummit of the heaving and struggling chaos of fantastic figures. I left\nthem still busy at this fierce and apparently aimless amusement. And as\nI went, I sang--\n\n        If a nobler waits for thee,\n             I will weep aside;\n         It is well that thou should’st be,\n             Of the nobler, bride.\n\n        For if love builds up the home,\n             Where the heart is free,\n         Homeless yet the heart must roam,\n             That has not found thee.\n\n        One must suffer: I, for her\n             Yield in her my part\n         Take her, thou art worthier--\n             Still I be still, my heart!\n\n         Gift ungotten! largess high\n             Of a frustrate will!\n          But to yield it lovingly\n             Is a something still.\n\nThen a little song arose of itself in my soul; and I felt for the\nmoment, while it sank sadly within me, as if I was once more walking up\nand down the white hall of Phantasy in the Fairy Palace. But this lasted\nno longer than the song; as will be seen.\n\n        Do not vex thy violet\n             Perfume to afford:\n         Else no odour thou wilt get\n             From its little hoard.\n\n        In thy lady’s gracious eyes\n             Look not thou too long;\n         Else from them the glory flies,\n             And thou dost her wrong.\n\n        Come not thou too near the maid,\n             Clasp her not too wild;\n         Else the splendour is allayed,\n             And thy heart beguiled.\n\nA crash of laughter, more discordant and deriding than any I had yet\nheard, invaded my ears. Looking on in the direction of the sound, I saw\na little elderly woman, much taller, however, than the goblins I had\njust left, seated upon a stone by the side of the path. She rose, as I\ndrew near, and came forward to meet me.\n\nShe was very plain and commonplace in appearance, without being\nhideously ugly. Looking up in my face with a stupid sneer, she said:\n“Isn’t it a pity you haven’t a pretty girl to walk all alone with\nyou through this sweet country? How different everything would look?\nwouldn’t it? Strange that one can never have what one would like best!\nHow the roses would bloom and all that, even in this infernal hole!\nwouldn’t they, Anodos? Her eyes would light up the old cave, wouldn’t\nthey?”\n\n“That depends on who the pretty girl should be,” replied I.\n\n“Not so very much matter that,” she answered; “look here.”\n\nI had turned to go away as I gave my reply, but now I stopped and looked\nat her. As a rough unsightly bud might suddenly blossom into the most\nlovely flower; or rather, as a sunbeam bursts through a shapeless cloud,\nand transfigures the earth; so burst a face of resplendent beauty, as it\nwere THROUGH the unsightly visage of the woman, destroying it with light\nas it dawned through it. A summer sky rose above me, gray with heat;\nacross a shining slumberous landscape, looked from afar the peaks of\nsnow-capped mountains; and down from a great rock beside me fell a sheet\nof water mad with its own delight.\n\n“Stay with me,” she said, lifting up her exquisite face, and looking\nfull in mine.\n\nI drew back. Again the infernal laugh grated upon my ears; again the\nrocks closed in around me, and the ugly woman looked at me with wicked,\nmocking hazel eyes.\n\n“You shall have your reward,” said she. “You shall see your white lady\nagain.”\n\n“That lies not with you,” I replied, and turned and left her.\n\nShe followed me with shriek upon shriek of laughter, as I went on my\nway.\n\nI may mention here, that although there was always light enough to see\nmy path and a few yards on every side of me, I never could find out the\nsource of this sad sepulchral illumination.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n        “In the wind’s uproar, the sea’s raging grim,\n          And the sighs that are born in him.”\n                                      HEINE.\n\n\n        “From dreams of bliss shall men awake\n          One day, but not to weep:\n          The dreams remain; they only break\n          The mirror of the sleep.”\n                                     JEAN PAUL, Hesperus.\n\nHow I got through this dreary part of my travels, I do not know. I do\nnot think I was upheld by the hope that any moment the light might break\nin upon me; for I scarcely thought about that. I went on with a dull\nendurance, varied by moments of uncontrollable sadness; for more and\nmore the conviction grew upon me that I should never see the white\nlady again. It may seem strange that one with whom I had held so little\ncommunion should have so engrossed my thoughts; but benefits conferred\nawaken love in some minds, as surely as benefits received in others.\nBesides being delighted and proud that my songs had called the\nbeautiful creature to life, the same fact caused me to feel a tenderness\nunspeakable for her, accompanied with a kind of feeling of property in\nher; for so the goblin Selfishness would reward the angel Love. When\nto all this is added, an overpowering sense of her beauty, and\nan unquestioning conviction that this was a true index to inward\nloveliness, it may be understood how it came to pass that my imagination\nfilled my whole soul with the play of its own multitudinous colours and\nharmonies around the form which yet stood, a gracious marble radiance,\nin the midst of ITS white hall of phantasy. The time passed by unheeded;\nfor my thoughts were busy. Perhaps this was also in part the cause of my\nneeding no food, and never thinking how I should find any, during this\nsubterraneous part of my travels. How long they endured I could not\ntell, for I had no means of measuring time; and when I looked back,\nthere was such a discrepancy between the decisions of my imagination\nand my judgment, as to the length of time that had passed, that I was\nbewildered, and gave up all attempts to arrive at any conclusion on the\npoint.\n\nA gray mist continually gathered behind me. When I looked back towards\nthe past, this mist was the medium through which my eyes had to strain\nfor a vision of what had gone by; and the form of the white lady had\nreceded into an unknown region. At length the country of rock began\nto close again around me, gradually and slowly narrowing, till I found\nmyself walking in a gallery of rock once more, both sides of which I\ncould touch with my outstretched hands. It narrowed yet, until I\nwas forced to move carefully, in order to avoid striking against the\nprojecting pieces of rock. The roof sank lower and lower, until I was\ncompelled, first to stoop, and then to creep on my hands and knees.\nIt recalled terrible dreams of childhood; but I was not much afraid,\nbecause I felt sure that this was my path, and my only hope of leaving\nFairy Land, of which I was now almost weary.\n\nAt length, on getting past an abrupt turn in the passage, through\nwhich I had to force myself, I saw, a few yards ahead of me, the\nlong-forgotten daylight shining through a small opening, to which the\npath, if path it could now be called, led me. With great difficulty I\naccomplished these last few yards, and came forth to the day. I stood on\nthe shore of a wintry sea, with a wintry sun just a few feet above its\nhorizon-edge. It was bare, and waste, and gray. Hundreds of hopeless\nwaves rushed constantly shorewards, falling exhausted upon a beach\nof great loose stones, that seemed to stretch miles and miles in both\ndirections. There was nothing for the eye but mingling shades of\ngray; nothing for the ear but the rush of the coming, the roar of the\nbreaking, and the moan of the retreating wave. No rock lifted up a\nsheltering severity above the dreariness around; even that from which I\nhad myself emerged rose scarcely a foot above the opening by which I\nhad reached the dismal day, more dismal even than the tomb I had left.\nA cold, death-like wind swept across the shore, seeming to issue from a\npale mouth of cloud upon the horizon. Sign of life was nowhere visible.\nI wandered over the stones, up and down the beach, a human imbodiment of\nthe nature around me. The wind increased; its keen waves flowed through\nmy soul; the foam rushed higher up the stones; a few dead stars began\nto gleam in the east; the sound of the waves grew louder and yet more\ndespairing. A dark curtain of cloud was lifted up, and a pale blue rent\nshone between its foot and the edge of the sea, out from which rushed an\nicy storm of frozen wind, that tore the waters into spray as it passed,\nand flung the billows in raving heaps upon the desolate shore. I could\nbear it no longer.\n\n“I will not be tortured to death,” I cried; “I will meet it half-way.\nThe life within me is yet enough to bear me up to the face of Death, and\nthen I die unconquered.”\n\nBefore it had grown so dark, I had observed, though without any\nparticular interest, that on one part of the shore a low platform of\nrock seemed to run out far into the midst of the breaking waters.\n\nTowards this I now went, scrambling over smooth stones, to which scarce\neven a particle of sea-weed clung; and having found it, I got on it, and\nfollowed its direction, as near as I could guess, out into the tumbling\nchaos. I could hardly keep my feet against the wind and sea. The waves\nrepeatedly all but swept me off my path; but I kept on my way, till I\nreached the end of the low promontory, which, in the fall of the waves,\nrose a good many feet above the surface, and, in their rise, was covered\nwith their waters. I stood one moment and gazed into the heaving abyss\nbeneath me; then plunged headlong into the mounting wave below. A\nblessing, like the kiss of a mother, seemed to alight on my soul; a\ncalm, deeper than that which accompanies a hope deferred, bathed my\nspirit. I sank far into the waters, and sought not to return. I felt as\nif once more the great arms of the beech-tree were around me, soothing\nme after the miseries I had passed through, and telling me, like a\nlittle sick child, that I should be better to-morrow. The waters of\nthemselves lifted me, as with loving arms, to the surface. I breathed\nagain, but did not unclose my eyes. I would not look on the wintry sea,\nand the pitiless gray sky. Thus I floated, till something gently touched\nme. It was a little boat floating beside me. How it came there I could\nnot tell; but it rose and sank on the waters, and kept touching me in\nits fall, as if with a human will to let me know that help was by me. It\nwas a little gay-coloured boat, seemingly covered with glistering scales\nlike those of a fish, all of brilliant rainbow hues. I scrambled into\nit, and lay down in the bottom, with a sense of exquisite repose.\n\nThen I drew over me a rich, heavy, purple cloth that was beside me; and,\nlying still, knew, by the sound of the waters, that my little bark was\nfleeting rapidly onwards. Finding, however, none of that stormy motion\nwhich the sea had manifested when I beheld it from the shore, I opened\nmy eyes; and, looking first up, saw above me the deep violet sky of a\nwarm southern night; and then, lifting my head, saw that I was sailing\nfast upon a summer sea, in the last border of a southern twilight. The\naureole of the sun yet shot the extreme faint tips of its longest rays\nabove the horizon-waves, and withdrew them not. It was a perpetual\ntwilight. The stars, great and earnest, like children’s eyes, bent down\nlovingly towards the waters; and the reflected stars within seemed to\nfloat up, as if longing to meet their embraces. But when I looked down,\na new wonder met my view. For, vaguely revealed beneath the wave, I\nfloated above my whole Past. The fields of my childhood flitted by; the\nhalls of my youthful labours; the streets of great cities where I had\ndwelt; and the assemblies of men and women wherein I had wearied myself\nseeking for rest. But so indistinct were the visions, that sometimes\nI thought I was sailing on a shallow sea, and that strange rocks and\nforests of sea-plants beguiled my eye, sufficiently to be transformed,\nby the magic of the phantasy, into well-known objects and regions. Yet,\nat times, a beloved form seemed to lie close beneath me in sleep; and\nthe eyelids would tremble as if about to forsake the conscious eye;\nand the arms would heave upwards, as if in dreams they sought for a\nsatisfying presence. But these motions might come only from the heaving\nof the waters between those forms and me. Soon I fell asleep, overcome\nwith fatigue and delight. In dreams of unspeakable joy--of restored\nfriendships; of revived embraces; of love which said it had never died;\nof faces that had vanished long ago, yet said with smiling lips that\nthey knew nothing of the grave; of pardons implored, and granted with\nsuch bursting floods of love, that I was almost glad I had sinned--thus\nI passed through this wondrous twilight. I awoke with the feeling that I\nhad been kissed and loved to my heart’s content; and found that my boat\nwas floating motionless by the grassy shore of a little island.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\n     “In still rest, in changeless simplicity, I bear,\n     uninterrupted, the consciousness of the whole of Humanity\n     within me.”--SCHLEIERMACHERS, Monologen.\n\n            “... such a sweetness, such a grace,\n                 In all thy speech appear,\n              That what to th’eye a beauteous face,\n                 That thy tongue is to the ear.”\n                                           --COWLEY.\n\nThe water was deep to the very edge; and I sprang from the little boat\nupon a soft grassy turf. The island seemed rich with a profusion of all\ngrasses and low flowers. All delicate lowly things were most plentiful;\nbut no trees rose skywards, not even a bush overtopped the tall grasses,\nexcept in one place near the cottage I am about to describe, where a few\nplants of the gum-cistus, which drops every night all the blossoms that\nthe day brings forth, formed a kind of natural arbour. The whole island\nlay open to the sky and sea. It rose nowhere more than a few feet above\nthe level of the waters, which flowed deep all around its border. Here\nthere seemed to be neither tide nor storm. A sense of persistent calm\nand fulness arose in the mind at the sight of the slow, pulse-like rise\nand fall of the deep, clear, unrippled waters against the bank of the\nisland, for shore it could hardly be called, being so much more like\nthe edge of a full, solemn river. As I walked over the grass towards the\ncottage, which stood at a little distance from the bank, all the flowers\nof childhood looked at me with perfect child-eyes out of the grass. My\nheart, softened by the dreams through which it had passed, overflowed\nin a sad, tender love towards them. They looked to me like children\nimpregnably fortified in a helpless confidence. The sun stood half-way\ndown the western sky, shining very soft and golden; and there grew a\nsecond world of shadows amidst the world of grasses and wild flowers.\n\nThe cottage was square, with low walls, and a high pyramidal roof\nthatched with long reeds, of which the withered blossoms hung over all\nthe eaves. It is noticeable that most of the buildings I saw in Fairy\nLand were cottages. There was no path to a door, nor, indeed, was there\nany track worn by footsteps in the island.\n\nThe cottage rose right out of the smooth turf. It had no windows that I\ncould see; but there was a door in the centre of the side facing me,\nup to which I went. I knocked, and the sweetest voice I had ever heard\nsaid, “Come in.” I entered. A bright fire was burning on a hearth in\nthe centre of the earthern floor, and the smoke found its way out at an\nopening in the centre of the pyramidal roof. Over the fire hung a little\npot, and over the pot bent a woman-face, the most wonderful, I thought,\nthat I had ever beheld. For it was older than any countenance I had ever\nlooked upon. There was not a spot in which a wrinkle could lie, where a\nwrinkle lay not. And the skin was ancient and brown, like old parchment.\nThe woman’s form was tall and spare: and when she stood up to welcome\nme, I saw that she was straight as an arrow. Could that voice of\nsweetness have issued from those lips of age? Mild as they were, could\nthey be the portals whence flowed such melody? But the moment I saw\nher eyes, I no longer wondered at her voice: they were absolutely\nyoung--those of a woman of five-and-twenty, large, and of a clear gray.\nWrinkles had beset them all about; the eyelids themselves were old, and\nheavy, and worn; but the eyes were very incarnations of soft light. She\nheld out her hand to me, and the voice of sweetness again greeted me,\nwith the single word, “Welcome.” She set an old wooden chair for me,\nnear the fire, and went on with her cooking. A wondrous sense of refuge\nand repose came upon me. I felt like a boy who has got home from school,\nmiles across the hills, through a heavy storm of wind and snow. Almost,\nas I gazed on her, I sprang from my seat to kiss those old lips. And\nwhen, having finished her cooking, she brought some of the dish she had\nprepared, and set it on a little table by me, covered with a snow-white\ncloth, I could not help laying my head on her bosom, and bursting\ninto happy tears. She put her arms round me, saying, “Poor child; poor\nchild!”\n\nAs I continued to weep, she gently disengaged herself, and, taking a\nspoon, put some of the food (I did not know what it was) to my lips,\nentreating me most endearingly to swallow it. To please her, I made an\neffort, and succeeded. She went on feeding me like a baby, with one arm\nround me, till I looked up in her face and smiled: then she gave me the\nspoon and told me to eat, for it would do me good. I obeyed her, and\nfound myself wonderfully refreshed. Then she drew near the fire an\nold-fashioned couch that was in the cottage, and making me lie down\nupon it, sat at my feet, and began to sing. Amazing store of old ballads\nrippled from her lips, over the pebbles of ancient tunes; and the voice\nthat sang was sweet as the voice of a tuneful maiden that singeth ever\nfrom very fulness of song. The songs were almost all sad, but with a\nsound of comfort. One I can faintly recall. It was something like this:\n\n            Sir Aglovaile through the churchyard rode;\n                 SING, ALL ALONE I LIE:\n             Little recked he where’er he yode,\n                 ALL ALONE, UP IN THE SKY.\n\n             Swerved his courser, and plunged with fear\n                 ALL ALONE I LIE:\n             His cry might have wakened the dead men near,\n                 ALL ALONE, UP IN THE SKY.\n\n            The very dead that lay at his feet,\n             Lapt in the mouldy winding-sheet.\n\n            But he curbed him and spurred him, until he stood\n             Still in his place, like a horse of wood,\n\n            With nostrils uplift, and eyes wide and wan;\n             But the sweat in streams from his fetlocks ran.\n\n            A ghost grew out of the shadowy air,\n             And sat in the midst of her moony hair.\n\n            In her gleamy hair she sat and wept;\n             In the dreamful moon they lay and slept;\n\n            The shadows above, and the bodies below,\n             Lay and slept in the moonbeams slow.\n\n            And she sang, like the moan of an autumn wind\n             Over the stubble left behind:\n\n              Alas, how easily things go wrong!\n               A sigh too much, or a kiss too long,\n              And there follows a mist and a weeping rain,\n                 And life is never the same again.\n\n                Alas, how hardly things go right!\n                 ‘Tis hard to watch on a summer night,\n                 For the sigh will come and the kiss will stay,\n                 And the summer night is a winter day.\n\n            “Oh, lovely ghosts my heart is woes\n             To see thee weeping and wailing so.\n\n            Oh, lovely ghost,” said the fearless knight,\n             “Can the sword of a warrior set it right?\n\n            Or prayer of bedesman, praying mild,\n             As a cup of water a feverish child,\n\n            Sooth thee at last, in dreamless mood\n             To sleep the sleep a dead lady should?\n\n            Thine eyes they fill me with longing sore,\n             As if I had known thee for evermore.\n\n            Oh, lovely ghost, I could leave the day\n             To sit with thee in the moon away\n\n            If thou wouldst trust me, and lay thy head\n             To rest on a bosom that is not dead.”\n              The lady sprang up with a strange ghost-cry,\n             And she flung her white ghost-arms on high:\n\n            And she laughed a laugh that was not gay,\n             And it lengthened out till it died away;\n\n            And the dead beneath turned and moaned,\n             And the yew-trees above they shuddered and groaned.\n\n            “Will he love me twice with a love that is vain?\n             Will he kill the poor ghost yet again?\n\n            I thought thou wert good; but I said, and wept:\n             ‘Can I have dreamed who have not slept?’\n\n            And I knew, alas! or ever I would,\n             Whether I dreamed, or thou wert good.\n\n            When my baby died, my brain grew wild.\n             I awoke, and found I was with my child.”\n\n            “If thou art the ghost of my Adelaide,\n             How is it?  Thou wert but a village maid,\n\n            And thou seemest an angel lady white,\n             Though thin, and wan, and past delight.”\n\n            The lady smiled a flickering smile,\n             And she pressed her temples hard the while.\n\n            “Thou seest that Death for a woman can\n             Do more than knighthood for a man.”\n\n            “But show me the child thou callest mine,\n             Is she out to-night in the ghost’s sunshine?”\n\n            “In St. Peter’s Church she is playing on,\n             At hide-and-seek, with Apostle John.\n\n            When the moonbeams right through the window go,\n             Where the twelve are standing in glorious show,\n\n            She says the rest of them do not stir,\n             But one comes down to play with her.\n\n            Then I can go where I list, and weep,\n             For good St. John my child will keep.”\n\n            “Thy beauty filleth the very air,\n              Never saw I a woman so fair.”\n\n            “Come, if thou darest, and sit by my side;\n              But do not touch me, or woe will betide.\n\n            Alas, I am weak: I might well know\n             This gladness betokens some further woe.\n\n             Yet come.  It will come.  I will bear it.  I can.\n              For thou lovest me yet--though but as a man.”\n\n            The knight dismounted in earnest speed;\n              Away through the tombstones thundered the steed,\n\n            And fell by the outer wall, and died.\n             But the knight he kneeled by the lady’s side;\n\n            Kneeled beside her in wondrous bliss,\n             Rapt in an everlasting kiss:\n\n            Though never his lips come the lady nigh,\n             And his eyes alone on her beauty lie.\n\n            All the night long, till the cock crew loud,\n             He kneeled by the lady, lapt in her shroud.\n\n            And what they said, I may not say:\n             Dead night was sweeter than living day.\n\n            How she made him so blissful glad\n             Who made her and found her so ghostly sad,\n\n            I may not tell; but it needs no touch\n             To make them blessed who love so much.\n\n            “Come every night, my ghost, to me;\n             And one night I will come to thee.\n\n            ‘Tis good to have a ghostly wife:\n             She will not tremble at clang of strife;\n\n            She will only hearken, amid the din,\n             Behind the door, if he cometh in.”\n\n            And this is how Sir Aglovaile\n            Often walked in the moonlight pale.\n\n            And oft when the crescent but thinned the gloom,\n             Full orbed moonlight filled his room;\n\n            And through beneath his chamber door,\n             Fell a ghostly gleam on the outer floor;\n\n            And they that passed, in fear averred\n             That murmured words they often heard.\n\n            ‘Twas then that the eastern crescent shone\n              Through the chancel window, and good St. John\n\n            Played with the ghost-child all the night,\n             And the mother was free till the morning light,\n\n            And sped through the dawning night, to stay\n             With Aglovaile till the break of day.\n\n            And their love was a rapture, lone and high,\n             And dumb as the moon in the topmost sky.\n\n            One night Sir Aglovaile, weary, slept\n             And dreamed a dream wherein he wept.\n\n            A warrior he was, not often wept he,\n             But this night he wept full bitterly.\n\n            He woke--beside him the ghost-girl shone\n             Out of the dark: ‘twas the eve of St. John.\n\n            He had dreamed a dream of a still, dark wood,\n             Where the maiden of old beside him stood;\n\n            But a mist came down, and caught her away,\n             And he sought her in vain through the pathless day,\n\n            Till he wept with the grief that can do no more,\n             And thought he had dreamt the dream before.\n\n            From bursting heart the weeping flowed on;\n             And lo! beside him the ghost-girl shone;\n\n            Shone like the light on a harbour’s breast,\n             Over the sea of his dream’s unrest;\n\n            Shone like the wondrous, nameless boon,\n             That the heart seeks ever, night or noon:\n\n            Warnings forgotten, when needed most,\n             He clasped to his bosom the radiant ghost.\n\n            She wailed aloud, and faded, and sank.\n             With upturn’d white face, cold and blank,\n\n            In his arms lay the corpse of the maiden pale,\n             And she came no more to Sir Aglovaile.\n\n            Only a voice, when winds were wild,\n             Sobbed and wailed like a chidden child.\n\n            Alas, how easily things go wrong!\n             A sigh too much, or a kiss too long,\n             And there follows a mist and a weeping rain,\n             And life is never the same again.\n\nThis was one of the simplest of her songs, which, perhaps, is the cause\nof my being able to remember it better than most of the others. While\nshe sung, I was in Elysium, with the sense of a rich soul upholding,\nembracing, and overhanging mine, full of all plenty and bounty. I felt\nas if she could give me everything I wanted; as if I should never wish\nto leave her, but would be content to be sung to and fed by her, day\nafter day, as years rolled by. At last I fell asleep while she sang.\n\nWhen I awoke, I knew not whether it was night or day. The fire had sunk\nto a few red embers, which just gave light enough to show me the woman\nstanding a few feet from me, with her back towards me, facing the\ndoor by which I had entered. She was weeping, but very gently and\nplentifully. The tears seemed to come freely from her heart. Thus she\nstood for a few minutes; then, slowly turning at right angles to her\nformer position, she faced another of the four sides of the cottage.\nI now observed, for the first time, that here was a door likewise; and\nthat, indeed, there was one in the centre of every side of the cottage.\n\nWhen she looked towards the second door, her tears ceased to flow, but\nsighs took their place. She often closed her eyes as she stood; and\nevery time she closed her eyes, a gentle sigh seemed to be born in her\nheart, and to escape at her lips. But when her eyes were open, her\nsighs were deep and very sad, and shook her whole frame. Then she turned\ntowards the third door, and a cry as of fear or suppressed pain broke\nfrom her; but she seemed to hearten herself against the dismay, and\nto front it steadily; for, although I often heard a slight cry, and\nsometimes a moan, yet she never moved or bent her head, and I felt sure\nthat her eyes never closed. Then she turned to the fourth door, and\nI saw her shudder, and then stand still as a statue; till at last she\nturned towards me and approached the fire. I saw that her face was white\nas death. But she gave one look upwards, and smiled the sweetest, most\nchild-innocent smile; then heaped fresh wood on the fire, and, sitting\ndown by the blaze, drew her wheel near her, and began to spin. While\nshe spun, she murmured a low strange song, to which the hum of the wheel\nmade a kind of infinite symphony. At length she paused in her spinning\nand singing, and glanced towards me, like a mother who looks whether\nor not her child gives signs of waking. She smiled when she saw that my\neyes were open. I asked her whether it was day yet. She answered, “It is\nalways day here, so long as I keep my fire burning.”\n\nI felt wonderfully refreshed; and a great desire to see more of the\nisland awoke within me. I rose, and saying that I wished to look about\nme, went towards the door by which I had entered.\n\n“Stay a moment,” said my hostess, with some trepidation in her voice.\n“Listen to me. You will not see what you expect when you go out of that\ndoor. Only remember this: whenever you wish to come back to me, enter\nwherever you see this mark.”\n\nShe held up her left hand between me and the fire. Upon the palm, which\nappeared almost transparent, I saw, in dark red, a mark like this -->\nwhich I took care to fix in my mind.\n\nShe then kissed me, and bade me good-bye with a solemnity that awed me;\nand bewildered me too, seeing I was only going out for a little ramble\nin an island, which I did not believe larger than could easily be\ncompassed in a few hours’ walk at most. As I went she resumed her\nspinning.\n\nI opened the door, and stepped out. The moment my foot touched the\nsmooth sward, I seemed to issue from the door of an old barn on my\nfather’s estate, where, in the hot afternoons, I used to go and lie\namongst the straw, and read. It seemed to me now that I had been asleep\nthere. At a little distance in the field, I saw two of my brothers at\nplay. The moment they caught sight of me, they called out to me to come\nand join them, which I did; and we played together as we had done years\nago, till the red sun went down in the west, and the gray fog began\nto rise from the river. Then we went home together with a strange\nhappiness. As we went, we heard the continually renewed larum of a\nlandrail in the long grass. One of my brothers and I separated to a\nlittle distance, and each commenced running towards the part whence the\nsound appeared to come, in the hope of approaching the spot where the\nbird was, and so getting at least a sight of it, if we should not be\nable to capture the little creature. My father’s voice recalled us from\ntrampling down the rich long grass, soon to be cut down and laid aside\nfor the winter. I had quite forgotten all about Fairy Land, and the\nwonderful old woman, and the curious red mark.\n\nMy favourite brother and I shared the same bed. Some childish dispute\narose between us; and our last words, ere we fell asleep, were not of\nkindness, notwithstanding the pleasures of the day. When I woke in the\nmorning, I missed him. He had risen early, and had gone to bathe in the\nriver. In another hour, he was brought home drowned. Alas! alas! if we\nhad only gone to sleep as usual, the one with his arm about the other!\nAmidst the horror of the moment, a strange conviction flashed across my\nmind, that I had gone through the very same once before.\n\nI rushed out of the house, I knew not why, sobbing and crying bitterly.\nI ran through the fields in aimless distress, till, passing the old\nbarn, I caught sight of a red mark on the door. The merest trifles\nsometimes rivet the attention in the deepest misery; the intellect has\nso little to do with grief. I went up to look at this mark, which I did\nnot remember ever to have seen before. As I looked at it, I thought I\nwould go in and lie down amongst the straw, for I was very weary with\nrunning about and weeping. I opened the door; and there in the cottage\nsat the old woman as I had left her, at her spinning-wheel.\n\n“I did not expect you quite so soon,” she said, as I shut the door\nbehind me. I went up to the couch, and threw myself on it with that\nfatigue wherewith one awakes from a feverish dream of hopeless grief.\n\nThe old woman sang:\n\n        The great sun, benighted,\n             May faint from the sky;\n         But love, once uplighted,\n             Will never more die.\n\n        Form, with its brightness,\n             From eyes will depart:\n         It walketh, in whiteness,\n             The halls of the heart.\n\nEre she had ceased singing, my courage had returned. I started from the\ncouch, and, without taking leave of the old woman, opened the door of\nSighs, and sprang into what should appear.\n\nI stood in a lordly hall, where, by a blazing fire on the hearth, sat a\nlady, waiting, I knew, for some one long desired. A mirror was near me,\nbut I saw that my form had no place within its depths, so I feared not\nthat I should be seen. The lady wonderfully resembled my marble lady,\nbut was altogether of the daughters of men, and I could not tell whether\nor not it was she.\n\nIt was not for me she waited. The tramp of a great horse rang through\nthe court without. It ceased, and the clang of armour told that his\nrider alighted, and the sound of his ringing heels approached the hall.\nThe door opened; but the lady waited, for she would meet her lord alone.\nHe strode in: she flew like a home-bound dove into his arms, and nestled\non the hard steel. It was the knight of the soiled armour. But now the\narmour shone like polished glass; and strange to tell, though the mirror\nreflected not my form, I saw a dim shadow of myself in the shining\nsteel.\n\n“O my beloved, thou art come, and I am blessed.”\n\nHer soft fingers speedily overcame the hard clasp of his helmet; one by\none she undid the buckles of his armour; and she toiled under the\nweight of the mail, as she WOULD carry it aside. Then she unclasped\nhis greaves, and unbuckled his spurs; and once more she sprang into\nhis arms, and laid her head where she could now feel the beating of his\nheart. Then she disengaged herself from his embrace, and, moving back a\nstep or two, gazed at him. He stood there a mighty form, crowned with a\nnoble head, where all sadness had disappeared, or had been absorbed in\nsolemn purpose. Yet I suppose that he looked more thoughtful than\nthe lady had expected to see him, for she did not renew her caresses,\nalthough his face glowed with love, and the few words he spoke were\nas mighty deeds for strength; but she led him towards the hearth, and\nseated him in an ancient chair, and set wine before him, and sat at his\nfeet.\n\n“I am sad,” he said, “when I think of the youth whom I met twice in the\nforests of Fairy Land; and who, you say, twice, with his songs, roused\nyou from the death-sleep of an evil enchantment. There was something\nnoble in him, but it was a nobleness of thought, and not of deed. He may\nyet perish of vile fear.”\n\n“Ah!” returned the lady, “you saved him once, and for that I thank you;\nfor may I not say that I somewhat loved him? But tell me how you fared,\nwhen you struck your battle-axe into the ash-tree, and he came and found\nyou; for so much of the story you had told me, when the beggar-child\ncame and took you away.”\n\n“As soon as I saw him,” rejoined the knight, “I knew that earthly arms\navailed not against such as he; and that my soul must meet him in its\nnaked strength. So I unclasped my helm, and flung it on the ground; and,\nholding my good axe yet in my hand, gazed at him with steady eyes. On\nhe came, a horror indeed, but I did not flinch. Endurance must conquer,\nwhere force could not reach. He came nearer and nearer, till the ghastly\nface was close to mine. A shudder as of death ran through me; but I\nthink I did not move, for he seemed to quail, and retreated. As soon\nas he gave back, I struck one more sturdy blow on the stem of his tree,\nthat the forest rang; and then looked at him again. He writhed and\ngrinned with rage and apparent pain, and again approached me, but\nretreated sooner than before. I heeded him no more, but hewed with a\nwill at the tree, till the trunk creaked, and the head bowed, and with a\ncrash it fell to the earth. Then I looked up from my labour, and lo! the\nspectre had vanished, and I saw him no more; nor ever in my wanderings\nhave I heard of him again.”\n\n“Well struck! well withstood! my hero,” said the lady.\n\n“But,” said the knight, somewhat troubled, “dost thou love the youth\nstill?”\n\n“Ah!” she replied, “how can I help it? He woke me from worse than death;\nhe loved me. I had never been for thee, if he had not sought me first.\nBut I love him not as I love thee. He was but the moon of my night; thou\nart the sun of my day, O beloved.”\n\n“Thou art right,” returned the noble man. “It were hard, indeed, not to\nhave some love in return for such a gift as he hath given thee. I, too,\nowe him more than words can speak.”\n\nHumbled before them, with an aching and desolate heart, I yet could not\nrestrain my words:\n\n“Let me, then, be the moon of thy night still, O woman! And when thy day\nis beclouded, as the fairest days will be, let some song of mine comfort\nthee, as an old, withered, half-forgotten thing, that belongs to an\nancient mournful hour of uncompleted birth, which yet was beautiful in\nits time.”\n\nThey sat silent, and I almost thought they were listening. The colour of\nthe lady’s eyes grew deeper and deeper; the slow tears grew, and filled\nthem, and overflowed. They rose, and passed, hand in hand, close\nto where I stood; and each looked towards me in passing. Then they\ndisappeared through a door which closed behind them; but, ere it closed,\nI saw that the room into which it opened was a rich chamber, hung with\ngorgeous arras. I stood with an ocean of sighs frozen in my bosom. I\ncould remain no longer. She was near me, and I could not see her; near\nme in the arms of one loved better than I, and I would not see her, and\nI would not be by her. But how to escape from the nearness of the best\nbeloved? I had not this time forgotten the mark; for the fact that I\ncould not enter the sphere of these living beings kept me aware that,\nfor me, I moved in a vision, while they moved in life. I looked all\nabout for the mark, but could see it nowhere; for I avoided looking\njust where it was. There the dull red cipher glowed, on the very door of\ntheir secret chamber. Struck with agony, I dashed it open, and fell at\nthe feet of the ancient woman, who still spun on, the whole dissolved\nocean of my sighs bursting from me in a storm of tearless sobs. Whether\nI fainted or slept, I do not know; but, as I returned to consciousness,\nbefore I seemed to have power to move, I heard the woman singing, and\ncould distinguish the words:\n\n        O light of dead and of dying days!\n             O Love! in thy glory go,\n         In a rosy mist and a moony maze,\n             O’er the pathless peaks of snow.\n\n        But what is left for the cold gray soul,\n             That moans like a wounded dove?\n         One wine is left in the broken bowl!--\n             ‘Tis--TO LOVE, AND LOVE AND LOVE.\n\n Now I could weep.  When she saw me weeping, she sang:\n\n        Better to sit at the waters’ birth,\n             Than a sea of waves to win;\n         To live in the love that floweth forth,\n             Than the love that cometh in.\n\n        Be thy heart a well of love, my child,\n             Flowing, and free, and sure;\n         For a cistern of love, though undefiled,\n             Keeps not the spirit pure.\n\nI rose from the earth, loving the white lady as I had never loved her\nbefore.\n\nThen I walked up to the door of Dismay, and opened it, and went out. And\nlo! I came forth upon a crowded street, where men and women went to\nand fro in multitudes. I knew it well; and, turning to one hand, walked\nsadly along the pavement. Suddenly I saw approaching me, a little way\noff, a form well known to me (WELL-KNOWN!--alas, how weak the word!) in\nthe years when I thought my boyhood was left behind, and shortly before\nI entered the realm of Fairy Land. Wrong and Sorrow had gone together,\nhand-in-hand as it is well they do.\n\nUnchangeably dear was that face. It lay in my heart as a child lies in\nits own white bed; but I could not meet her.\n\n“Anything but that,” I said, and, turning aside, sprang up the steps\nto a door, on which I fancied I saw the mystic sign. I entered--not the\nmysterious cottage, but her home. I rushed wildly on, and stood by the\ndoor of her room.\n\n“She is out,” I said, “I will see the old room once more.”\n\nI opened the door gently, and stood in a great solemn church. A\ndeep-toned bell, whose sounds throbbed and echoed and swam through the\nempty building, struck the hour of midnight. The moon shone through\nthe windows of the clerestory, and enough of the ghostly radiance was\ndiffused through the church to let me see, walking with a stately, yet\nsomewhat trailing and stumbling step, down the opposite aisle, for I\nstood in one of the transepts, a figure dressed in a white robe, whether\nfor the night, or for that longer night which lies too deep for the day,\nI could not tell. Was it she? and was this her chamber? I crossed the\nchurch, and followed. The figure stopped, seemed to ascend as it were\na high bed, and lay down. I reached the place where it lay, glimmering\nwhite. The bed was a tomb. The light was too ghostly to see clearly, but\nI passed my hand over the face and the hands and the feet, which were\nall bare. They were cold--they were marble, but I knew them. It grew\ndark. I turned to retrace my steps, but found, ere long, that I had\nwandered into what seemed a little chapel. I groped about, seeking the\ndoor. Everything I touched belonged to the dead. My hands fell on the\ncold effigy of a knight who lay with his legs crossed and his sword\nbroken beside him. He lay in his noble rest, and I lived on in ignoble\nstrife. I felt for the left hand and a certain finger; I found there the\nring I knew: he was one of my own ancestors. I was in the chapel over\nthe burial-vault of my race. I called aloud: “If any of the dead are\nmoving here, let them take pity upon me, for I, alas! am still alive;\nand let some dead woman comfort me, for I am a stranger in the land of\nthe dead, and see no light.” A warm kiss alighted on my lips through\nthe dark. And I said, “The dead kiss well; I will not be afraid.” And a\ngreat hand was reached out of the dark, and grasped mine for a moment,\nmightily and tenderly. I said to myself: “The veil between, though very\ndark, is very thin.”\n\nGroping my way further, I stumbled over the heavy stone that covered the\nentrance of the vault: and, in stumbling, descried upon the stone the\nmark, glowing in red fire. I caught the great ring. All my effort could\nnot have moved the huge slab; but it opened the door of the cottage, and\nI threw myself once more, pale and speechless, on the couch beside the\nancient dame. She sang once more:\n\n        Thou dreamest: on a rock thou art,\n             High o’er the broken wave;\n         Thou fallest with a fearful start\n             But not into thy grave;\n         For, waking in the morning’s light,\n         Thou smilest at the vanished night\n\n        So wilt thou sink, all pale and dumb,\n             Into the fainting gloom;\n         But ere the coming terrors come,\n             Thou wak’st--where is the tomb?\n         Thou wak’st--the dead ones smile above,\n         With hovering arms of sleepless love.\n\n She paused; then sang again:\n\n        We weep for gladness, weep for grief;\n             The tears they are the same;\n         We sigh for longing, and relief;\n             The sighs have but one name,\n\n        And mingled in the dying strife,\n             Are moans that are not sad\n          The pangs of death are throbs of life,\n             Its sighs are sometimes glad.\n\n         The face is very strange and white:\n             It is Earth’s only spot\n         That feebly flickers back the light\n             The living seeth not.\n\n I fell asleep, and slept a dreamless sleep, for I know not how\nlong. When I awoke, I found that my hostess had moved from where she had\nbeen sitting, and now sat between me and the fourth door.\n\nI guessed that her design was to prevent my entering there. I sprang\nfrom the couch, and darted past her to the door. I opened it at once and\nwent out. All I remember is a cry of distress from the woman: “Don’t go\nthere, my child! Don’t go there!” But I was gone.\n\nI knew nothing more; or, if I did, I had forgot it all when I awoke to\nconsciousness, lying on the floor of the cottage, with my head in the\nlap of the woman, who was weeping over me, and stroking my hair with\nboth hands, talking to me as a mother might talk to a sick and sleeping,\nor a dead child. As soon as I looked up and saw her, she smiled\nthrough her tears; smiled with withered face and young eyes, till her\ncountenance was irradiated with the light of the smile. Then she bathed\nmy head and face and hands in an icy cold, colourless liquid, which\nsmelt a little of damp earth. Immediately I was able to sit up. She rose\nand put some food before me. When I had eaten, she said: “Listen to me,\nmy child. You must leave me directly!”\n\n“Leave you!” I said. “I am so happy with you. I never was so happy in my\nlife.”\n\n“But you must go,” she rejoined sadly. “Listen! What do you hear?”\n\n“I hear the sound as of a great throbbing of water.”\n\n“Ah! you do hear it? Well, I had to go through that door--the door of\nthe Timeless” (and she shuddered as she pointed to the fourth door)--“to\nfind you; for if I had not gone, you would never have entered again;\nand because I went, the waters around my cottage will rise and rise,\nand flow and come, till they build a great firmament of waters over my\ndwelling. But as long as I keep my fire burning, they cannot enter.\nI have fuel enough for years; and after one year they will sink away\nagain, and be just as they were before you came. I have not been buried\nfor a hundred years now.” And she smiled and wept.\n\n“Alas! alas!” I cried. “I have brought this evil on the best and kindest\nof friends, who has filled my heart with great gifts.”\n\n“Do not think of that,” she rejoined. “I can bear it very well. You will\ncome back to me some day, I know. But I beg you, for my sake, my\ndear child, to do one thing. In whatever sorrow you may be, however\ninconsolable and irremediable it may appear, believe me that the old\nwoman in the cottage, with the young eyes” (and she smiled), “knows\nsomething, though she must not always tell it, that would quite satisfy\nyou about it, even in the worst moments of your distress. Now you must\ngo.”\n\n“But how can I go, if the waters are all about, and if the doors all\nlead into other regions and other worlds?”\n\n“This is not an island,” she replied; “but is joined to the land by a\nnarrow neck; and for the door, I will lead you myself through the right\none.”\n\nShe took my hand, and led me through the third door; whereupon I found\nmyself standing in the deep grassy turf on which I had landed from the\nlittle boat, but upon the opposite side of the cottage. She pointed out\nthe direction I must take, to find the isthmus and escape the rising\nwaters.\n\nThen putting her arms around me, she held me to her bosom; and as I\nkissed her, I felt as if I were leaving my mother for the first time,\nand could not help weeping bitterly. At length she gently pushed me\naway, and with the words, “Go, my son, and do something worth doing,”\n turned back, and, entering the cottage, closed the door behind her. I\nfelt very desolate as I went.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\n            “Thou hadst no fame; that which thou didst like good\n         Was but thy appetite that swayed thy blood\n         For that time to the best; for as a blast\n         That through a house comes, usually doth cast\n         Things out of order, yet by chance may come\n         And blow some one thing to his proper room,\n         So did thy appetite, and not thy zeal,\n         Sway thee by chance to do some one thing well.”\n                               FLETCHER’S Faithful Shepherdess.\n\n            “The noble hart that harbours vertuous thought\n         And is with childe of glorious great intent,\n         Can never rest, until it forth have brought\n         Th’ eternall brood of glorie excellent.”\n                               SPENSER, The Faerie Queene.\n\nI had not gone very far before I felt that the turf beneath my feet was\nsoaked with the rising waters. But I reached the isthmus in safety. It\nwas rocky, and so much higher than the level of the peninsula, that I\nhad plenty of time to cross. I saw on each side of me the water rising\nrapidly, altogether without wind, or violent motion, or broken waves,\nbut as if a slow strong fire were glowing beneath it. Ascending a steep\nacclivity, I found myself at last in an open, rocky country. After\ntravelling for some hours, as nearly in a straight line as I could,\nI arrived at a lonely tower, built on the top of a little hill, which\noverlooked the whole neighbouring country. As I approached, I heard\nthe clang of an anvil; and so rapid were the blows, that I despaired of\nmaking myself heard till a pause in the work should ensue. It was\nsome minutes before a cessation took place; but when it did, I knocked\nloudly, and had not long to wait; for, a moment after, the door was\npartly opened by a noble-looking youth, half-undressed, glowing with\nheat, and begrimed with the blackness of the forge. In one hand he held\na sword, so lately from the furnace that it yet shone with a dull fire.\nAs soon as he saw me, he threw the door wide open, and standing aside,\ninvited me very cordially to enter. I did so; when he shut and bolted\nthe door most carefully, and then led the way inwards. He brought me\ninto a rude hall, which seemed to occupy almost the whole of the ground\nfloor of the little tower, and which I saw was now being used as a\nworkshop. A huge fire roared on the hearth, beside which was an anvil.\nBy the anvil stood, in similar undress, and in a waiting attitude,\nhammer in hand, a second youth, tall as the former, but far more\nslightly built. Reversing the usual course of perception in such\nmeetings, I thought them, at first sight, very unlike; and at the second\nglance, knew that they were brothers. The former, and apparently the\nelder, was muscular and dark, with curling hair, and large hazel eyes,\nwhich sometimes grew wondrously soft. The second was slender and fair,\nyet with a countenance like an eagle, and an eye which, though pale\nblue, shone with an almost fierce expression. He stood erect, as if\nlooking from a lofty mountain crag, over a vast plain outstretched\nbelow. As soon as we entered the hall, the elder turned to me, and I saw\nthat a glow of satisfaction shone on both their faces. To my surprise\nand great pleasure, he addressed me thus:\n\n“Brother, will you sit by the fire and rest, till we finish this part of\nour work?”\n\nI signified my assent; and, resolved to await any disclosure they might\nbe inclined to make, seated myself in silence near the hearth.\n\nThe elder brother then laid the sword in the fire, covered it well over,\nand when it had attained a sufficient degree of heat, drew it out and\nlaid it on the anvil, moving it carefully about, while the younger, with\na succession of quick smart blows, appeared either to be welding it,\nor hammering one part of it to a consenting shape with the rest. Having\nfinished, they laid it carefully in the fire; and, when it was very\nhot indeed, plunged it into a vessel full of some liquid, whence a blue\nflame sprang upwards, as the glowing steel entered.\n\nThere they left it; and drawing two stools to the fire, sat down, one on\neach side of me.\n\n“We are very glad to see you, brother. We have been expecting you for\nsome days,” said the dark-haired youth.\n\n“I am proud to be called your brother,” I rejoined; “and you will not\nthink I refuse the name, if I desire to know why you honour me with it?”\n\n“Ah! then he does not know about it,” said the younger. “We thought you\nhad known of the bond betwixt us, and the work we have to do together.\nYou must tell him, brother, from the first.”\n\nSo the elder began:\n\n“Our father is king of this country. Before we were born, three giant\nbrothers had appeared in the land. No one knew exactly when, and no one\nhad the least idea whence they came. They took possession of a ruined\ncastle that had stood unchanged and unoccupied within the memory of any\nof the country people. The vaults of this castle had remained uninjured\nby time, and these, I presume, they made use of at first. They were\nrarely seen, and never offered the least injury to any one; so that they\nwere regarded in the neighbourhood as at least perfectly harmless, if\nnot rather benevolent beings. But it began to be observed, that the old\ncastle had assumed somehow or other, no one knew when or how, a somewhat\ndifferent look from what it used to have. Not only were several breaches\nin the lower part of the walls built up, but actually some of the\nbattlements which yet stood, had been repaired, apparently to prevent\nthem from falling into worse decay, while the more important parts were\nbeing restored. Of course, every one supposed the giants must have a\nhand in the work, but no one ever saw them engaged in it. The peasants\nbecame yet more uneasy, after one, who had concealed himself, and\nwatched all night, in the neighbourhood of the castle, reported that he\nhad seen, in full moonlight, the three huge giants working with might\nand main, all night long, restoring to their former position some\nmassive stones, formerly steps of a grand turnpike stair, a great\nportion of which had long since fallen, along with part of the wall\nof the round tower in which it had been built. This wall they were\ncompleting, foot by foot, along with the stair. But the people said\nthey had no just pretext for interfering: although the real reason for\nletting the giants alone was, that everybody was far too much afraid of\nthem to interrupt them.\n\n“At length, with the help of a neighbouring quarry, the whole of the\nexternal wall of the castle was finished. And now the country folks were\nin greater fear than before. But for several years the giants remained\nvery peaceful. The reason of this was afterwards supposed to be the\nfact, that they were distantly related to several good people in the\ncountry; for, as long as these lived, they remained quiet; but as soon\nas they were all dead the real nature of the giants broke out. Having\ncompleted the outside of their castle, they proceeded, by spoiling the\ncountry houses around them, to make a quiet luxurious provision for\ntheir comfort within. Affairs reached such a pass, that the news of\ntheir robberies came to my father’s ears; but he, alas! was so crippled\nin his resources, by a war he was carrying on with a neighbouring\nprince, that he could only spare a very few men, to attempt the capture\nof their stronghold. Upon these the giants issued in the night, and slew\nevery man of them. And now, grown bolder by success and impunity, they\nno longer confined their depredations to property, but began to seize\nthe persons of their distinguished neighbours, knights and ladies, and\nhold them in durance, the misery of which was heightened by all\nmanner of indignity, until they were redeemed by their friends, at an\nexorbitant ransom. Many knights have adventured their overthrow, but to\ntheir own instead; for they have all been slain, or captured, or forced\nto make a hasty retreat. To crown their enormities, if any man now\nattempts their destruction, they, immediately upon his defeat, put one\nor more of their captives to a shameful death, on a turret in sight of\nall passers-by; so that they have been much less molested of late;\nand we, although we have burned, for years, to attack these demons\nand destroy them, dared not, for the sake of their captives, risk the\nadventure, before we should have reached at least our earliest manhood.\nNow, however, we are preparing for the attempt; and the grounds of\nthis preparation are these. Having only the resolution, and not the\nexperience necessary for the undertaking, we went and consulted a lonely\nwoman of wisdom, who lives not very far from here, in the direction of\nthe quarter from which you have come. She received us most kindly, and\ngave us what seems to us the best of advice. She first inquired what\nexperience we had had in arms. We told her we had been well exercised\nfrom our boyhood, and for some years had kept ourselves in constant\npractice, with a view to this necessity.\n\n“‘But you have not actually fought for life and death?’ said she.\n\n“We were forced to confess we had not.\n\n“‘So much the better in some respects,’ she replied. ‘Now listen to me.\nGo first and work with an armourer, for as long time as you find needful\nto obtain a knowledge of his craft; which will not be long, seeing your\nhearts will be all in the work. Then go to some lonely tower, you two\nalone. Receive no visits from man or woman. There forge for yourselves\nevery piece of armour that you wish to wear, or to use, in your coming\nencounter. And keep up your exercises. As, however, two of you can be no\nmatch for the three giants, I will find you, if I can, a third brother,\nwho will take on himself the third share of the fight, and the\npreparation. Indeed, I have already seen one who will, I think, be the\nvery man for your fellowship, but it will be some time before he comes\nto me. He is wandering now without an aim. I will show him to you in a\nglass, and, when he comes, you will know him at once. If he will share\nyour endeavours, you must teach him all you know, and he will repay you\nwell, in present song, and in future deeds.’\n\n“She opened the door of a curious old cabinet that stood in the room.\nOn the inside of this door was an oval convex mirror. Looking in it for\nsome time, we at length saw reflected the place where we stood, and the\nold dame seated in her chair. Our forms were not reflected. But at the\nfeet of the dame lay a young man, yourself, weeping.\n\n“‘Surely this youth will not serve our ends,’ said I, ‘for he weeps.’\n\n“The old woman smiled. ‘Past tears are present strength,’ said she.\n\n“‘Oh!’ said my brother, ‘I saw you weep once over an eagle you shot.’\n\n“‘That was because it was so like you, brother,’ I replied; ‘but indeed,\nthis youth may have better cause for tears than that--I was wrong.’\n\n“‘Wait a while,’ said the woman; ‘if I mistake not, he will make you\nweep till your tears are dry for ever. Tears are the only cure for\nweeping. And you may have need of the cure, before you go forth to fight\nthe giants. You must wait for him, in your tower, till he comes.’\n\n“Now if you will join us, we will soon teach you to make your armour;\nand we will fight together, and work together, and love each other as\nnever three loved before. And you will sing to us, will you not?”\n\n“That I will, when I can,” I answered; “but it is only at times that the\npower of song comes upon me. For that I must wait; but I have a feeling\nthat if I work well, song will not be far off to enliven the labour.”\n\nThis was all the compact made: the brothers required nothing more, and\nI did not think of giving anything more. I rose, and threw off my upper\ngarments.\n\n“I know the uses of the sword,” I said. “I am ashamed of my white hands\nbeside yours so nobly soiled and hard; but that shame will soon be wiped\naway.”\n\n“No, no; we will not work to-day. Rest is as needful as toil. Bring the\nwine, brother; it is your turn to serve to-day.”\n\nThe younger brother soon covered a table with rough viands, but good\nwine; and we ate and drank heartily, beside our work. Before the meal\nwas over, I had learned all their story. Each had something in his heart\nwhich made the conviction, that he would victoriously perish in the\ncoming conflict, a real sorrow to him. Otherwise they thought they would\nhave lived enough. The causes of their trouble were respectively these:\n\nWhile they wrought with an armourer, in a city famed for workmanship\nin steel and silver, the elder had fallen in love with a lady as\nfar beneath him in real rank, as she was above the station he had\nas apprentice to an armourer. Nor did he seek to further his suit by\ndiscovering himself; but there was simply so much manhood about him,\nthat no one ever thought of rank when in his company. This is what his\nbrother said about it. The lady could not help loving him in return. He\ntold her when he left her, that he had a perilous adventure before him,\nand that when it was achieved, she would either see him return to claim\nher, or hear that he had died with honour. The younger brother’s grief\narose from the fact, that, if they were both slain, his old father, the\nking, would be childless. His love for his father was so exceeding, that\nto one unable to sympathise with it, it would have appeared extravagant.\nBoth loved him equally at heart; but the love of the younger had\nbeen more developed, because his thoughts and anxieties had not been\notherwise occupied. When at home, he had been his constant companion;\nand, of late, had ministered to the infirmities of his growing age. The\nyouth was never weary of listening to the tales of his sire’s youthful\nadventures; and had not yet in the smallest degree lost the conviction,\nthat his father was the greatest man in the world. The grandest triumph\npossible to his conception was, to return to his father, laden with the\nspoils of one of the hated giants. But they both were in some dread,\nlest the thought of the loneliness of these two might occur to them,\nin the moment when decision was most necessary, and disturb, in some\ndegree, the self-possession requisite for the success of their attempt.\nFor, as I have said, they were yet untried in actual conflict. “Now,”\n thought I, “I see to what the powers of my gift must minister.” For my\nown part, I did not dread death, for I had nothing to care to live for;\nbut I dreaded the encounter because of the responsibility connected with\nit. I resolved however to work hard, and thus grow cool, and quick, and\nforceful.\n\nThe time passed away in work and song, in talk and ramble, in friendly\nfight and brotherly aid. I would not forge for myself armour of heavy\nmail like theirs, for I was not so powerful as they, and depended more\nfor any success I might secure, upon nimbleness of motion, certainty of\neye, and ready response of hand. Therefore I began to make for myself a\nshirt of steel plates and rings; which work, while more troublesome,\nwas better suited to me than the heavier labour. Much assistance did the\nbrothers give me, even after, by their instructions, I was able to make\nsome progress alone. Their work was in a moment abandoned, to render any\nrequired aid to mine. As the old woman had promised, I tried to repay\nthem with song; and many were the tears they both shed over my ballads\nand dirges. The songs they liked best to hear were two which I made for\nthem. They were not half so good as many others I knew, especially some\nI had learned from the wise woman in the cottage; but what comes nearest\nto our needs we like the best.\n\nI       The king sat on his throne\n            Glowing in gold and red;\n         The crown in his right hand shone,\n             And the gray hairs crowned his head.\n\n        His only son walks in,\n            And in walls of steel he stands:\n         Make me, O father, strong to win,\n             With the blessing of holy hands.”\n\n        He knelt before his sire,\n             Who blessed him with feeble smile\n          His eyes shone out with a kingly fire,\n             But his old lips quivered the while.\n\n        “Go to the fight, my son,\n             Bring back the giant’s head;\n         And the crown with which my brows have done,\n             Shall glitter on thine instead.”\n\n        “My father, I seek no crowns,\n             But unspoken praise from thee;\n         For thy people’s good, and thy renown,\n             I will die to set them free.”\n\n        The king sat down and waited there,\n             And rose not, night nor day;\n         Till a sound of shouting filled the air,\n             And cries of a sore dismay.\n\n        Then like a king he sat once more,\n             With the crown upon his head;\n         And up to the throne the people bore\n             A mighty giant dead.\n\n        And up to the throne the people bore\n             A pale and lifeless boy.\n         The king rose up like a prophet of yore,\n             In a lofty, deathlike joy.\n\n        He put the crown on the chilly brow:\n             “Thou should’st have reigned with me\n         But Death is the king of both, and now\n             I go to obey with thee.\n\n        “Surely some good in me there lay,\n             To beget the noble one.”\n          The old man smiled like a winter day,\n             And fell beside his son.\n\nII      “O lady, thy lover is dead,” they cried;\n         “He is dead, but hath slain the foe;\n         He hath left his name to be magnified\n             In a song of wonder and woe.”\n\n        “Alas! I am well repaid,” said she,\n             “With a pain that stings like joy:\n         For I feared, from his tenderness to me,\n             That he was but a feeble boy.\n\n        “Now I shall hold my head on high,\n             The queen among my kind;\n         If ye hear a sound, ‘tis only a sigh\n             For a glory left behind.”\n\nThe first three times I sang these songs they both wept passionately.\nBut after the third time, they wept no more. Their eyes shone, and their\nfaces grew pale, but they never wept at any of my songs again.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\n        “I put my life in my hands.”--The Book of Judges.\n\nAt length, with much toil and equal delight, our armour was finished.\nWe armed each other, and tested the strength of the defence, with many\nblows of loving force. I was inferior in strength to both my brothers,\nbut a little more agile than either; and upon this agility, joined to\nprecision in hitting with the point of my weapon, I grounded my hopes of\nsuccess in the ensuing combat. I likewise laboured to develop yet more\nthe keenness of sight with which I was naturally gifted; and, from the\nremarks of my companions, I soon learned that my endeavours were not in\nvain.\n\nThe morning arrived on which we had determined to make the attempt,\nand succeed or perish--perhaps both. We had resolved to fight on foot;\nknowing that the mishap of many of the knights who had made the attempt,\nhad resulted from the fright of their horses at the appearance of the\ngiants; and believing with Sir Gawain, that, though mare’s sons might\nbe false to us, the earth would never prove a traitor. But most of our\npreparations were, in their immediate aim at least, frustrated.\n\nWe rose, that fatal morning, by daybreak. We had rested from all labour\nthe day before, and now were fresh as the lark. We bathed in cold\nspring water, and dressed ourselves in clean garments, with a sense of\npreparation, as for a solemn festivity. When we had broken our fast,\nI took an old lyre, which I had found in the tower and had myself\nrepaired, and sung for the last time the two ballads of which I have\nsaid so much already. I followed them with this, for a closing song:\n\n        Oh, well for him who breaks his dream\n             With the blow that ends the strife\n         And, waking, knows the peace that flows\n             Around the pain of life!\n\n        We are dead, my brothers!  Our bodies clasp,\n             As an armour, our souls about;\n         This hand is the battle-axe I grasp,\n             And this my hammer stout.\n\n        Fear not, my brothers, for we are dead;\n             No noise can break our rest;\n         The calm of the grave is about the head,\n             And the heart heaves not the breast.\n\n         And our life we throw to our people back,\n             To live with, a further store;\n         We leave it them, that there be no lack\n             In the land where we live no more.\n\n         Oh, well for him who breaks his dream\n             With the blow that ends the strife\n          And, waking, knows the peace that flows\n             Around the noise of life!\n\n As the last few tones of the instrument were following, like a\ndirge, the death of the song, we all sprang to our feet. For, through\none of the little windows of the tower, towards which I had looked as\nI sang, I saw, suddenly rising over the edge of the slope on which our\ntower stood, three enormous heads. The brothers knew at once, by my\nlooks, what caused my sudden movement. We were utterly unarmed, and\nthere was no time to arm.\n\nBut we seemed to adopt the same resolution simultaneously; for each\ncaught up his favourite weapon, and, leaving his defence behind, sprang\nto the door. I snatched up a long rapier, abruptly, but very finely\npointed, in my sword-hand, and in the other a sabre; the elder brother\nseized his heavy battle-axe; and the younger, a great, two-handed sword,\nwhich he wielded in one hand like a feather. We had just time to get\nclear of the tower, embrace and say good-bye, and part to some little\ndistance, that we might not encumber each other’s motions, ere the\ntriple giant-brotherhood drew near to attack us. They were about twice\nour height, and armed to the teeth. Through the visors of their helmets\ntheir monstrous eyes shone with a horrible ferocity. I was in the middle\nposition, and the middle giant approached me. My eyes were busy with his\narmour, and I was not a moment in settling my mode of attack. I saw that\nhis body-armour was somewhat clumsily made, and that the overlappings\nin the lower part had more play than necessary; and I hoped that, in\na fortunate moment, some joint would open a little, in a visible and\naccessible part. I stood till he came near enough to aim a blow at me\nwith the mace, which has been, in all ages, the favourite weapon of\ngiants, when, of course, I leaped aside, and let the blow fall upon the\nspot where I had been standing. I expected this would strain the joints\nof his armour yet more. Full of fury, he made at me again; but I kept\nhim busy, constantly eluding his blows, and hoping thus to fatigue him.\nHe did not seem to fear any assault from me, and I attempted none as\nyet; but while I watched his motions in order to avoid his blows, I, at\nthe same time, kept equal watch upon those joints of his armour, through\nsome one of which I hoped to reach his life. At length, as if somewhat\nfatigued, he paused a moment, and drew himself slightly up; I bounded\nforward, foot and hand, ran my rapier right through to the armour of\nhis back, let go the hilt, and passing under his right arm, turned as\nhe fell, and flew at him with my sabre. At one happy blow I divided the\nband of his helmet, which fell off, and allowed me, with a second cut\nacross the eyes, to blind him quite; after which I clove his head, and\nturned, uninjured, to see how my brothers had fared. Both the giants\nwere down, but so were my brothers. I flew first to the one and then\nto the other couple. Both pairs of combatants were dead, and yet locked\ntogether, as in the death-struggle. The elder had buried his battle-axe\nin the body of his foe, and had fallen beneath him as he fell. The giant\nhad strangled him in his own death-agonies. The younger had nearly hewn\noff the left leg of his enemy; and, grappled with in the act, had,\nwhile they rolled together on the earth, found for his dagger a passage\nbetwixt the gorget and cuirass of the giant, and stabbed him mortally in\nthe throat. The blood from the giant’s throat was yet pouring over the\nhand of his foe, which still grasped the hilt of the dagger sheathed\nin the wound. They lay silent. I, the least worthy, remained the sole\nsurvivor in the lists.\n\nAs I stood exhausted amidst the dead, after the first worthy deed of my\nlife, I suddenly looked behind me, and there lay the Shadow, black in\nthe sunshine. I went into the lonely tower, and there lay the useless\narmour of the noble youths--supine as they.\n\nAh, how sad it looked! It was a glorious death, but it was death. My\nsongs could not comfort me now. I was almost ashamed that I was alive,\nwhen they, the true-hearted, were no more. And yet I breathed freer to\nthink that I had gone through the trial, and had not failed. And perhaps\nI may be forgiven, if some feelings of pride arose in my bosom, when I\nlooked down on the mighty form that lay dead by my hand.\n\n“After all, however,” I said to myself, and my heart sank, “it was only\nskill. Your giant was but a blunderer.”\n\nI left the bodies of friends and foes, peaceful enough when the\ndeath-fight was over, and, hastening to the country below, roused the\npeasants. They came with shouting and gladness, bringing waggons to\ncarry the bodies. I resolved to take the princes home to their father,\neach as he lay, in the arms of his country’s foe. But first I searched\nthe giants, and found the keys of their castle, to which I repaired,\nfollowed by a great company of the people. It was a place of wonderful\nstrength. I released the prisoners, knights and ladies, all in a sad\ncondition, from the cruelties and neglects of the giants. It humbled me\nto see them crowding round me with thanks, when in truth the glorious\nbrothers, lying dead by their lonely tower, were those to whom the\nthanks belonged. I had but aided in carrying out the thought born\nin their brain, and uttered in visible form before ever I laid hold\nthereupon. Yet I did count myself happy to have been chosen for their\nbrother in this great deed.\n\nAfter a few hours spent in refreshing and clothing the prisoners, we all\ncommenced our journey towards the capital. This was slow at first; but,\nas the strength and spirits of the prisoners returned, it became more\nrapid; and in three days we reached the palace of the king. As we\nentered the city gates, with the huge bulks lying each on a waggon drawn\nby horses, and two of them inextricably intertwined with the dead bodies\nof their princes, the people raised a shout and then a cry, and followed\nin multitudes the solemn procession.\n\nI will not attempt to describe the behaviour of the grand old king. Joy\nand pride in his sons overcame his sorrow at their loss. On me he heaped\nevery kindness that heart could devise or hand execute. He used to sit\nand question me, night after night, about everything that was in any\nway connected with them and their preparations. Our mode of life,\nand relation to each other, during the time we spent together, was a\nconstant theme. He entered into the minutest details of the construction\nof the armour, even to a peculiar mode of riveting some of the plates,\nwith unwearying interest. This armour I had intended to beg of the king,\nas my sole memorials of the contest; but, when I saw the delight he took\nin contemplating it, and the consolation it appeared to afford him in\nhis sorrow, I could not ask for it; but, at his request, left my own,\nweapons and all, to be joined with theirs in a trophy, erected in the\ngrand square of the palace. The king, with gorgeous ceremony, dubbed me\nknight with his own old hand, in which trembled the sword of his youth.\n\nDuring the short time I remained, my company was, naturally, much\ncourted by the young nobles. I was in a constant round of gaiety and\ndiversion, notwithstanding that the court was in mourning. For the\ncountry was so rejoiced at the death of the giants, and so many of their\nlost friends had been restored to the nobility and men of wealth, that\nthe gladness surpassed the grief. “Ye have indeed left your lives to\nyour people, my great brothers!” I said.\n\nBut I was ever and ever haunted by the old shadow, which I had not seen\nall the time that I was at work in the tower. Even in the society of the\nladies of the court, who seemed to think it only their duty to make\nmy stay there as pleasant to me as possible, I could not help being\nconscious of its presence, although it might not be annoying me at the\ntime. At length, somewhat weary of uninterrupted pleasure, and nowise\nstrengthened thereby, either in body or mind, I put on a splendid suit\nof armour of steel inlaid with silver, which the old king had given\nme, and, mounting the horse on which it had been brought to me, took my\nleave of the palace, to visit the distant city in which the lady dwelt,\nwhom the elder prince had loved. I anticipated a sore task, in conveying\nto her the news of his glorious fate: but this trial was spared me, in a\nmanner as strange as anything that had happened to me in Fairy Land.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\n        “No one has my form but the I.”\n           Schoppe, in JEAN PAUL’S Titan.\n\n                    “Joy’s a subtil elf.\n         I think man’s happiest when he forgets himself.”\n                        CYRIL TOURNEUR, The Revenger’s Tragedy.\n\n\nOn the third day of my journey, I was riding gently along a road,\napparently little frequented, to judge from the grass that grew upon\nit. I was approaching a forest. Everywhere in Fairy Land forests are the\nplaces where one may most certainly expect adventures. As I drew near, a\nyouth, unarmed, gentle, and beautiful, who had just cut a branch from a\nyew growing on the skirts of the wood, evidently to make himself a bow,\nmet me, and thus accosted me:\n\n“Sir knight, be careful as thou ridest through this forest; for it is\nsaid to be strangely enchanted, in a sort which even those who have been\nwitnesses of its enchantment can hardly describe.”\n\nI thanked him for his advice, which I promised to follow, and rode on.\nBut the moment I entered the wood, it seemed to me that, if enchantment\nthere was, it must be of a good kind; for the Shadow, which had been\nmore than usually dark and distressing, since I had set out on this\njourney, suddenly disappeared. I felt a wonderful elevation of spirits,\nand began to reflect on my past life, and especially on my combat\nwith the giants, with such satisfaction, that I had actually to remind\nmyself, that I had only killed one of them; and that, but for the\nbrothers, I should never have had the idea of attacking them, not to\nmention the smallest power of standing to it. Still I rejoiced, and\ncounted myself amongst the glorious knights of old; having even the\nunspeakable presumption--my shame and self-condemnation at the memory\nof it are such, that I write it as the only and sorest penance I can\nperform--to think of myself (will the world believe it?) as side by side\nwith Sir Galahad! Scarcely had the thought been born in my mind, when,\napproaching me from the left, through the trees, I espied a resplendent\nknight, of mighty size, whose armour seemed to shine of itself, without\nthe sun. When he drew near, I was astonished to see that this armour was\nlike my own; nay, I could trace, line for line, the correspondence of\nthe inlaid silver to the device on my own. His horse, too, was like mine\nin colour, form, and motion; save that, like his rider, he was greater\nand fiercer than his counterpart. The knight rode with beaver up. As he\nhalted right opposite to me in the narrow path, barring my way, I saw\nthe reflection of my countenance in the centre plate of shining steel on\nhis breastplate. Above it rose the same face--his face--only, as I have\nsaid, larger and fiercer. I was bewildered. I could not help feeling\nsome admiration of him, but it was mingled with a dim conviction that he\nwas evil, and that I ought to fight with him.\n\n“Let me pass,” I said.\n\n“When I will,” he replied.\n\nSomething within me said: “Spear in rest, and ride at him! else thou art\nfor ever a slave.”\n\nI tried, but my arm trembled so much, that I could not couch my lance.\nTo tell the truth, I, who had overcome the giant, shook like a coward\nbefore this knight. He gave a scornful laugh, that echoed through the\nwood, turned his horse, and said, without looking round, “Follow me.”\n\nI obeyed, abashed and stupefied. How long he led, and how long I\nfollowed, I cannot tell. “I never knew misery before,” I said to myself.\n“Would that I had at least struck him, and had had my death-blow in\nreturn! Why, then, do I not call to him to wheel and defend himself?\nAlas! I know not why, but I cannot. One look from him would cow me like\na beaten hound.” I followed, and was silent.\n\nAt length we came to a dreary square tower, in the middle of a dense\nforest. It looked as if scarce a tree had been cut down to make room for\nit. Across the very door, diagonally, grew the stem of a tree, so large\nthat there was just room to squeeze past it in order to enter. One\nmiserable square hole in the roof was the only visible suggestion of a\nwindow. Turret or battlement, or projecting masonry of any kind, it had\nnone. Clear and smooth and massy, it rose from its base, and ended with\na line straight and unbroken. The roof, carried to a centre from each of\nthe four walls, rose slightly to the point where the rafters met. Round\nthe base lay several little heaps of either bits of broken branches,\nwithered and peeled, or half-whitened bones; I could not distinguish\nwhich. As I approached, the ground sounded hollow beneath my horse’s\nhoofs. The knight took a great key from his pocket, and reaching past\nthe stem of the tree, with some difficulty opened the door. “Dismount,”\n he commanded. I obeyed. He turned my horse’s head away from the tower,\ngave him a terrible blow with the flat side of his sword, and sent him\nmadly tearing through the forest.\n\n“Now,” said he, “enter, and take your companion with you.”\n\nI looked round: knight and horse had vanished, and behind me lay the\nhorrible shadow. I entered, for I could not help myself; and the shadow\nfollowed me. I had a terrible conviction that the knight and he were\none. The door closed behind me.\n\nNow I was indeed in pitiful plight. There was literally nothing in the\ntower but my shadow and me. The walls rose right up to the roof; in\nwhich, as I had seen from without, there was one little square opening.\nThis I now knew to be the only window the tower possessed. I sat down on\nthe floor, in listless wretchedness. I think I must have fallen asleep,\nand have slept for hours; for I suddenly became aware of existence, in\nobserving that the moon was shining through the hole in the roof. As she\nrose higher and higher, her light crept down the wall over me, till at\nlast it shone right upon my head. Instantaneously the walls of the tower\nseemed to vanish away like a mist. I sat beneath a beech, on the edge\nof a forest, and the open country lay, in the moonlight, for miles and\nmiles around me, spotted with glimmering houses and spires and towers. I\nthought with myself, “Oh, joy! it was only a dream; the horrible narrow\nwaste is gone, and I wake beneath a beech-tree, perhaps one that loves\nme, and I can go where I will.” I rose, as I thought, and walked about,\nand did what I would, but ever kept near the tree; for always, and, of\ncourse, since my meeting with the woman of the beech-tree far more than\never, I loved that tree. So the night wore on. I waited for the sun to\nrise, before I could venture to renew my journey. But as soon as the\nfirst faint light of the dawn appeared, instead of shining upon me\nfrom the eye of the morning, it stole like a fainting ghost through the\nlittle square hole above my head; and the walls came out as the light\ngrew, and the glorious night was swallowed up of the hateful day. The\nlong dreary day passed. My shadow lay black on the floor. I felt no\nhunger, no need of food. The night came. The moon shone. I watched her\nlight slowly descending the wall, as I might have watched, adown the\nsky, the long, swift approach of a helping angel. Her rays touched me,\nand I was free. Thus night after night passed away. I should have died\nbut for this. Every night the conviction returned, that I was free.\nEvery morning I sat wretchedly disconsolate. At length, when the course\nof the moon no longer permitted her beams to touch me, the night was\ndreary as the day.\n\nWhen I slept, I was somewhat consoled by my dreams; but all the time I\ndreamed, I knew that I was only dreaming. But one night, at length, the\nmoon, a mere shred of pallor, scattered a few thin ghostly rays upon me;\nand I think I fell asleep and dreamed. I sat in an autumn night before\nthe vintage, on a hill overlooking my own castle. My heart sprang with\njoy. Oh, to be a child again, innocent, fearless, without shame or\ndesire! I walked down to the castle. All were in consternation at my\nabsence. My sisters were weeping for my loss. They sprang up and clung\nto me, with incoherent cries, as I entered. My old friends came flocking\nround me. A gray light shone on the roof of the hall. It was the\nlight of the dawn shining through the square window of my tower.\nMore earnestly than ever, I longed for freedom after this dream; more\ndrearily than ever, crept on the next wretched day. I measured by the\nsunbeams, caught through the little window in the trap of my tower, how\nit went by, waiting only for the dreams of the night.\n\nAbout noon, I started as if something foreign to all my senses and all\nmy experience, had suddenly invaded me; yet it was only the voice of\na woman singing. My whole frame quivered with joy, surprise, and the\nsensation of the unforeseen. Like a living soul, like an incarnation of\nNature, the song entered my prison-house. Each tone folded its wings,\nand laid itself, like a caressing bird, upon my heart. It bathed me like\na sea; inwrapt me like an odorous vapour; entered my soul like a long\ndraught of clear spring-water; shone upon me like essential sunlight;\nsoothed me like a mother’s voice and hand. Yet, as the clearest\nforest-well tastes sometimes of the bitterness of decayed leaves, so to\nmy weary, prisoned heart, its cheerfulness had a sting of cold, and its\ntenderness unmanned me with the faintness of long-departed joys. I wept\nhalf-bitterly, half-luxuriously; but not long. I dashed away the tears,\nashamed of a weakness which I thought I had abandoned. Ere I knew, I had\nwalked to the door, and seated myself with my ears against it, in order\nto catch every syllable of the revelation from the unseen outer world.\nAnd now I heard each word distinctly. The singer seemed to be standing\nor sitting near the tower, for the sounds indicated no change of place.\nThe song was something like this:\n\n         The sun, like a golden knot on high,\n         Gathers the glories of the sky,\n         And binds them into a shining tent,\n         Roofing the world with the firmament.\n         And through the pavilion the rich winds blow,\n         And through the pavilion the waters go.\n         And the birds for joy, and the trees for prayer,\n         Bowing their heads in the sunny air,\n         And for thoughts, the gently talking springs,\n         That come from the centre with secret things--\n         All make a music, gentle and strong,\n         Bound by the heart into one sweet song.\n         And amidst them all, the mother Earth\n         Sits with the children of her birth;\n         She tendeth them all, as a mother hen\n         Her little ones round her, twelve or ten:\n         Oft she sitteth, with hands on knee,\n         Idle with love for her family.\n         Go forth to her from the dark and the dust,\n         And weep beside her, if weep thou must;\n         If she may not hold thee to her breast,\n         Like a weary infant, that cries for rest\n         At least she will press thee to her knee,\n         And tell a low, sweet tale to thee,\n         Till the hue to thy cheeky and the light to thine eye,\n         Strength to thy limbs, and courage high\n         To thy fainting heart, return amain,\n         And away to work thou goest again.\n         From the narrow desert, O man of pride,\n         Come into the house, so high and wide.\n\n\nHardly knowing what I did, I opened the door. Why had I not done so\nbefore? I do not know.\n\nAt first I could see no one; but when I had forced myself past the tree\nwhich grew across the entrance, I saw, seated on the ground, and leaning\nagainst the tree, with her back to my prison, a beautiful woman. Her\ncountenance seemed known to me, and yet unknown. She looked at me and\nsmiled, when I made my appearance.\n\n“Ah! were you the prisoner there? I am very glad I have wiled you out.”\n\n“Do you know me then?” “Do you not know me? But you hurt me, and that,\nI suppose, makes it easy for a man to forget. You broke my globe. Yet\nI thank you. Perhaps I owe you many thanks for breaking it. I took the\npieces, all black, and wet with crying over them, to the Fairy Queen.\nThere was no music and no light in them now. But she took them from me,\nand laid them aside; and made me go to sleep in a great hall of white,\nwith black pillars, and many red curtains. When I woke in the morning,\nI went to her, hoping to have my globe again, whole and sound; but she\nsent me away without it, and I have not seen it since. Nor do I care for\nit now. I have something so much better. I do not need the globe to play\nto me; for I can sing. I could not sing at all before. Now I go about\neverywhere through Fairy Land, singing till my heart is like to break,\njust like my globe, for very joy at my own songs. And wherever I go, my\nsongs do good, and deliver people. And now I have delivered you, and I\nam so happy.”\n\nShe ceased, and the tears came into her eyes.\n\nAll this time, I had been gazing at her; and now fully recognised the\nface of the child, glorified in the countenance of the woman.\n\nI was ashamed and humbled before her; but a great weight was lifted\nfrom my thoughts. I knelt before her, and thanked her, and begged her to\nforgive me.\n\n“Rise, rise,” she said; “I have nothing to forgive; I thank you. But now\nI must be gone, for I do not know how many may be waiting for me, here\nand there, through the dark forests; and they cannot come out till I\ncome.”\n\nShe rose, and with a smile and a farewell, turned and left me. I dared\nnot ask her to stay; in fact, I could hardly speak to her. Between\nher and me, there was a great gulf. She was uplifted, by sorrow and\nwell-doing, into a region I could hardly hope ever to enter. I watched\nher departure, as one watches a sunset. She went like a radiance through\nthe dark wood, which was henceforth bright to me, from simply knowing\nthat such a creature was in it.\n\nShe was bearing the sun to the unsunned spots. The light and the music\nof her broken globe were now in her heart and her brain. As she went,\nshe sang; and I caught these few words of her song; and the tones seemed\nto linger and wind about the trees after she had disappeared:\n\n             Thou goest thine, and I go mine--\n             Many ways we wend;\n             Many days, and many ways,\n             Ending in one end.\n\n             Many a wrong, and its curing song;\n             Many a road, and many an inn;\n             Room to roam, but only one home\n             For all the world to win.\n And so she vanished.  With a sad heart, soothed by humility, and\nthe knowledge of her peace and gladness, I bethought me what now I\nshould do. First, I must leave the tower far behind me, lest, in some\nevil moment, I might be once more caged within its horrible walls. But\nit was ill walking in my heavy armour; and besides I had now no right\nto the golden spurs and the resplendent mail, fitly dulled with long\nneglect. I might do for a squire; but I honoured knighthood too highly,\nto call myself any longer one of the noble brotherhood. I stripped off\nall my armour, piled it under the tree, just where the lady had been\nseated, and took my unknown way, eastward through the woods. Of all my\nweapons, I carried only a short axe in my hand.\n\nThen first I knew the delight of being lowly; of saying to myself, “I\nam what I am, nothing more.” “I have failed,” I said, “I have lost\nmyself--would it had been my shadow.” I looked round: the shadow was\nnowhere to be seen. Ere long, I learned that it was not myself, but\nonly my shadow, that I had lost. I learned that it is better, a\nthousand-fold, for a proud man to fall and be humbled, than to hold up\nhis head in his pride and fancied innocence. I learned that he that will\nbe a hero, will barely be a man; that he that will be nothing but a doer\nof his work, is sure of his manhood. In nothing was my ideal lowered, or\ndimmed, or grown less precious; I only saw it too plainly, to set myself\nfor a moment beside it. Indeed, my ideal soon became my life; whereas,\nformerly, my life had consisted in a vain attempt to behold, if not my\nideal in myself, at least myself in my ideal. Now, however, I took, at\nfirst, what perhaps was a mistaken pleasure, in despising and degrading\nmyself. Another self seemed to arise, like a white spirit from a dead\nman, from the dumb and trampled self of the past. Doubtless, this self\nmust again die and be buried, and again, from its tomb, spring a winged\nchild; but of this my history as yet bears not the record.\n\nSelf will come to life even in the slaying of self; but there is ever\nsomething deeper and stronger than it, which will emerge at last from\nthe unknown abysses of the soul: will it be as a solemn gloom, burning\nwith eyes? or a clear morning after the rain? or a smiling child, that\nfinds itself nowhere, and everywhere?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\n        “High erected thought, seated in a heart of courtesy.”\n                                 SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.\n\n            “A sweet attractive kinde of grace,\n                 A full assurance given by lookes,\n              Continuall comfort in a face,\n                 The lineaments of Gospel bookes.”\n                            MATTHEW ROYDON, on Sir Philip Sidney.\n\n\nI had not gone far, for I had but just lost sight of the hated tower,\nwhen a voice of another sort, sounding near or far, as the trees\npermitted or intercepted its passage, reached me. It was a full, deep,\nmanly voice, but withal clear and melodious. Now it burst on the ear\nwith a sudden swell, and anon, dying away as suddenly, seemed to come to\nme across a great space. Nevertheless, it drew nearer; till, at last, I\ncould distinguish the words of the song, and get transient glimpses of\nthe singer, between the columns of the trees. He came nearer, dawning\nupon me like a growing thought. He was a knight, armed from head to\nheel, mounted upon a strange-looking beast, whose form I could not\nunderstand. The words which I heard him sing were like these:\n\n          Heart be stout,\n           And eye be true;\n          Good blade out!\n           And ill shall rue.\n\n          Courage, horse!\n           Thou lackst no skill;\n          Well thy force\n           Hath matched my will.\n\n          For the foe\n           With fiery breath,\n          At a blow,\n           Is still in death.\n\n          Gently, horse!\n           Tread fearlessly;\n         ‘Tis his corse\n           That burdens thee.\n\n          The sun’s eye\n           Is fierce at noon;\n          Thou and I\n           Will rest full soon.\n\n          And new strength\n           New work will meet;\n          Till, at length,\n           Long rest is sweet.\n\nAnd now horse and rider had arrived near enough for me to see, fastened\nby the long neck to the hinder part of the saddle, and trailing its\nhideous length on the ground behind, the body of a great dragon. It was\nno wonder that, with such a drag at his heels, the horse could make\nbut slow progress, notwithstanding his evident dismay. The horrid,\nserpent-like head, with its black tongue, forked with red, hanging out\nof its jaws, dangled against the horse’s side. Its neck was covered with\nlong blue hair, its sides with scales of green and gold. Its back was of\ncorrugated skin, of a purple hue. Its belly was similar in nature, but\nits colour was leaden, dashed with blotches of livid blue. Its skinny,\nbat-like wings and its tail were of a dull gray. It was strange to see\nhow so many gorgeous colours, so many curving lines, and such beautiful\nthings as wings and hair and scales, combined to form the horrible\ncreature, intense in ugliness.\n\nThe knight was passing me with a salutation; but, as I walked towards\nhim, he reined up, and I stood by his stirrup. When I came near him, I\nsaw to my surprise and pleasure likewise, although a sudden pain, like\na birth of fire, sprang up in my heart, that it was the knight of the\nsoiled armour, whom I knew before, and whom I had seen in the vision,\nwith the lady of the marble. But I could have thrown my arms around him,\nbecause she loved him. This discovery only strengthened the resolution\nI had formed, before I recognised him, of offering myself to the knight,\nto wait upon him as a squire, for he seemed to be unattended. I made\nmy request in as few words as possible. He hesitated for a moment, and\nlooked at me thoughtfully. I saw that he suspected who I was, but that\nhe continued uncertain of his suspicion. No doubt he was soon convinced\nof its truth; but all the time I was with him, not a word crossed his\nlips with reference to what he evidently concluded I wished to leave\nunnoticed, if not to keep concealed.\n\n“Squire and knight should be friends,” said he: “can you take me by the\nhand?” And he held out the great gauntleted right hand. I grasped it\nwillingly and strongly. Not a word more was said. The knight gave the\nsign to his horse, which again began his slow march, and I walked beside\nand a little behind.\n\nWe had not gone very far before we arrived at a little cottage; from\nwhich, as we drew near, a woman rushed out with the cry:\n\n“My child! my child! have you found my child?”\n\n“I have found her,” replied the knight, “but she is sorely hurt. I was\nforced to leave her with the hermit, as I returned. You will find her\nthere, and I think she will get better. You see I have brought you\na present. This wretch will not hurt you again.” And he undid the\ncreature’s neck, and flung the frightful burden down by the cottage\ndoor.\n\nThe woman was now almost out of sight in the wood; but the husband stood\nat the door, with speechless thanks in his face.\n\n“You must bury the monster,” said the knight. “If I had arrived a moment\nlater, I should have been too late. But now you need not fear, for such\na creature as this very rarely appears, in the same part, twice during a\nlifetime.”\n\n“Will you not dismount and rest you, Sir Knight?” said the peasant, who\nhad, by this time, recovered himself a little.\n\n“That I will, thankfully,” said he; and, dismounting, he gave the reins\nto me, and told me to unbridle the horse, and lead him into the shade.\n“You need not tie him up,” he added; “he will not run away.”\n\nWhen I returned, after obeying his orders, and entered the cottage, I\nsaw the knight seated, without his helmet, and talking most familiarly\nwith the simple host. I stood at the open door for a moment, and, gazing\nat him, inwardly justified the white lady in preferring him to me. A\nnobler countenance I never saw. Loving-kindness beamed from every line\nof his face. It seemed as if he would repay himself for the late arduous\ncombat, by indulging in all the gentleness of a womanly heart. But when\nthe talk ceased for a moment, he seemed to fall into a reverie. Then the\nexquisite curves of the upper lip vanished. The lip was lengthened and\ncompressed at the same moment. You could have told that, within the\nlips, the teeth were firmly closed. The whole face grew stern and\ndetermined, all but fierce; only the eyes burned on like a holy\nsacrifice, uplift on a granite rock.\n\nThe woman entered, with her mangled child in her arms. She was pale\nas her little burden. She gazed, with a wild love and despairing\ntenderness, on the still, all but dead face, white and clear from loss\nof blood and terror.\n\nThe knight rose. The light that had been confined to his eyes, now shone\nfrom his whole countenance. He took the little thing in his arms, and,\nwith the mother’s help, undressed her, and looked to her wounds. The\ntears flowed down his face as he did so. With tender hands he bound them\nup, kissed the pale cheek, and gave her back to her mother. When he went\nhome, all his tale would be of the grief and joy of the parents; while\nto me, who had looked on, the gracious countenance of the armed man,\nbeaming from the panoply of steel, over the seemingly dead child, while\nthe powerful hands turned it and shifted it, and bound it, if possible\neven more gently than the mother’s, formed the centre of the story.\n\nAfter we had partaken of the best they could give us, the knight took\nhis leave, with a few parting instructions to the mother as to how she\nshould treat the child.\n\nI brought the knight his steed, held the stirrup while he mounted, and\nthen followed him through the wood. The horse, delighted to be free\nof his hideous load, bounded beneath the weight of man and armour, and\ncould hardly be restrained from galloping on. But the knight made him\ntime his powers to mine, and so we went on for an hour or two. Then\nthe knight dismounted, and compelled me to get into the saddle, saying:\n“Knight and squire must share the labour.”\n\nHolding by the stirrup, he walked along by my side, heavily clad as he\nwas, with apparent ease. As we went, he led a conversation, in which I\ntook what humble part my sense of my condition would permit me.\n\n“Somehow or other,” said he, “notwithstanding the beauty of this country\nof Faerie, in which we are, there is much that is wrong in it. If there\nare great splendours, there are corresponding horrors; heights and\ndepths; beautiful women and awful fiends; noble men and weaklings. All\na man has to do, is to better what he can. And if he will settle it\nwith himself, that even renown and success are in themselves of no great\nvalue, and be content to be defeated, if so be that the fault is not\nhis; and so go to his work with a cool brain and a strong will, he\nwill get it done; and fare none the worse in the end, that he was not\nburdened with provision and precaution.”\n\n“But he will not always come off well,” I ventured to say.\n\n“Perhaps not,” rejoined the knight, “in the individual act; but the\nresult of his lifetime will content him.”\n\n“So it will fare with you, doubtless,” thought I; “but for me---”\n\nVenturing to resume the conversation after a pause, I said,\nhesitatingly:\n\n“May I ask for what the little beggar-girl wanted your aid, when she\ncame to your castle to find you?”\n\nHe looked at me for a moment in silence, and then said--\n\n“I cannot help wondering how you know of that; but there is something\nabout you quite strange enough to entitle you to the privilege of the\ncountry; namely, to go unquestioned. I, however, being only a man, such\nas you see me, am ready to tell you anything you like to ask me, as far\nas I can. The little beggar-girl came into the hall where I was sitting,\nand told me a very curious story, which I can only recollect very\nvaguely, it was so peculiar. What I can recall is, that she was sent to\ngather wings. As soon as she had gathered a pair of wings for herself,\nshe was to fly away, she said, to the country she came from; but where\nthat was, she could give no information.\n\n“She said she had to beg her wings from the butterflies and moths; and\nwherever she begged, no one refused her. But she needed a great many of\nthe wings of butterflies and moths to make a pair for her; and so she\nhad to wander about day after day, looking for butterflies, and night\nafter night, looking for moths; and then she begged for their wings. But\nthe day before, she had come into a part of the forest, she said, where\nthere were multitudes of splendid butterflies flitting about, with wings\nwhich were just fit to make the eyes in the shoulders of hers; and she\nknew she could have as many of them as she liked for the asking; but as\nsoon as she began to beg, there came a great creature right up to her,\nand threw her down, and walked over her. When she got up, she saw\nthe wood was full of these beings stalking about, and seeming to have\nnothing to do with each other. As soon as ever she began to beg, one of\nthem walked over her; till at last in dismay, and in growing horror of\nthe senseless creatures, she had run away to look for somebody to help\nher. I asked her what they were like. She said, like great men, made of\nwood, without knee-or elbow-joints, and without any noses or mouths or\neyes in their faces. I laughed at the little maiden, thinking she was\nmaking child’s game of me; but, although she burst out laughing too, she\npersisted in asserting the truth of her story.”\n\n“‘Only come, knight, come and see; I will lead you.’\n\n“So I armed myself, to be ready for anything that might happen, and\nfollowed the child; for, though I could make nothing of her story, I\ncould see she was a little human being in need of some help or other. As\nshe walked before me, I looked attentively at her. Whether or not it was\nfrom being so often knocked down and walked over, I could not tell, but\nher clothes were very much torn, and in several places her white skin\nwas peeping through. I thought she was hump-backed; but on looking more\nclosely, I saw, through the tatters of her frock--do not laugh at me--a\nbunch on each shoulder, of the most gorgeous colours. Looking yet more\nclosely, I saw that they were of the shape of folded wings, and were\nmade of all kinds of butterfly-wings and moth-wings, crowded together\nlike the feathers on the individual butterfly pinion; but, like them,\nmost beautifully arranged, and producing a perfect harmony of colour and\nshade. I could now more easily believe the rest of her story; especially\nas I saw, every now and then, a certain heaving motion in the wings,\nas if they longed to be uplifted and outspread. But beneath her scanty\ngarments complete wings could not be concealed, and indeed, from her own\nstory, they were yet unfinished.\n\n“After walking for two or three hours (how the little girl found her\nway, I could not imagine), we came to a part of the forest, the very\nair of which was quivering with the motions of multitudes of resplendent\nbutterflies; as gorgeous in colour, as if the eyes of peacocks’ feathers\nhad taken to flight, but of infinite variety of hue and form, only that\nthe appearance of some kind of eye on each wing predominated. ‘There\nthey are, there they are!’ cried the child, in a tone of victory mingled\nwith terror. Except for this tone, I should have thought she referred\nto the butterflies, for I could see nothing else. But at that moment\nan enormous butterfly, whose wings had great eyes of blue surrounded by\nconfused cloudy heaps of more dingy colouring, just like a break in\nthe clouds on a stormy day towards evening, settled near us. The child\ninstantly began murmuring: ‘Butterfly, butterfly, give me your wings’;\nwhen, the moment after, she fell to the ground, and began crying as if\nhurt. I drew my sword and heaved a great blow in the direction in\nwhich the child had fallen. It struck something, and instantly the most\ngrotesque imitation of a man became visible. You see this Fairy Land is\nfull of oddities and all sorts of incredibly ridiculous things, which a\nman is compelled to meet and treat as real existences, although all the\ntime he feels foolish for doing so. This being, if being it could be\ncalled, was like a block of wood roughly hewn into the mere outlines\nof a man; and hardly so, for it had but head, body, legs, and arms--the\nhead without a face, and the limbs utterly formless. I had hewn off one\nof its legs, but the two portions moved on as best they could, quite\nindependent of each other; so that I had done no good. I ran after\nit, and clove it in twain from the head downwards; but it could not be\nconvinced that its vocation was not to walk over people; for, as soon as\nthe little girl began her begging again, all three parts came bustling\nup; and if I had not interposed my weight between her and them, she\nwould have been trampled again under them. I saw that something else\nmust be done. If the wood was full of the creatures, it would be an\nendless work to chop them so small that they could do no injury; and\nthen, besides, the parts would be so numerous, that the butterflies\nwould be in danger from the drift of flying chips. I served this one\nso, however; and then told the girl to beg again, and point out the\ndirection in which one was coming. I was glad to find, however, that\nI could now see him myself, and wondered how they could have been\ninvisible before. I would not allow him to walk over the child; but\nwhile I kept him off, and she began begging again, another appeared; and\nit was all I could do, from the weight of my armour, to protect her from\nthe stupid, persevering efforts of the two. But suddenly the right plan\noccurred to me. I tripped one of them up, and, taking him by the legs,\nset him up on his head, with his heels against a tree. I was delighted\nto find he could not move. Meantime the poor child was walked over by\nthe other, but it was for the last time. Whenever one appeared, I\nfollowed the same plan--tripped him up and set him on his head; and so\nthe little beggar was able to gather her wings without any trouble,\nwhich occupation she continued for several hours in my company.”\n\n“What became of her?” I asked.\n\n“I took her home with me to my castle, and she told me all her story;\nbut it seemed to me, all the time, as if I were hearing a child talk in\nits sleep. I could not arrange her story in my mind at all, although it\nseemed to leave hers in some certain order of its own. My wife---”\n\nHere the knight checked himself, and said no more. Neither did I urge\nthe conversation farther.\n\nThus we journeyed for several days, resting at night in such shelter\nas we could get; and when no better was to be had, lying in the forest\nunder some tree, on a couch of old leaves.\n\nI loved the knight more and more. I believe never squire served his\nmaster with more care and joyfulness than I. I tended his horse; I\ncleaned his armour; my skill in the craft enabled me to repair it when\nnecessary; I watched his needs; and was well repaid for all by the love\nitself which I bore him.\n\n“This,” I said to myself, “is a true man. I will serve him, and give him\nall worship, seeing in him the imbodiment of what I would fain become.\nIf I cannot be noble myself, I will yet be servant to his nobleness.”\n He, in return, soon showed me such signs of friendship and respect, as\nmade my heart glad; and I felt that, after all, mine would be no lost\nlife, if I might wait on him to the world’s end, although no smile but\nhis should greet me, and no one but him should say, “Well done! he was\na good servant!” at last. But I burned to do something more for him than\nthe ordinary routine of a squire’s duty permitted.\n\nOne afternoon, we began to observe an appearance of roads in the wood.\nBranches had been cut down, and openings made, where footsteps had worn\nno path below. These indications increased as we passed on, till, at\nlength, we came into a long, narrow avenue, formed by felling the trees\nin its line, as the remaining roots evidenced. At some little distance,\non both hands, we observed signs of similar avenues, which appeared to\nconverge with ours, towards one spot. Along these we indistinctly saw\nseveral forms moving, which seemed, with ourselves, to approach the\ncommon centre. Our path brought us, at last, up to a wall of yew-trees,\ngrowing close together, and intertwining their branches so, that nothing\ncould be seen beyond it. An opening was cut in it like a door, and all\nthe wall was trimmed smooth and perpendicular. The knight dismounted,\nand waited till I had provided for his horse’s comfort; upon which we\nentered the place together.\n\nIt was a great space, bare of trees, and enclosed by four walls of yew,\nsimilar to that through which we had entered. These trees grew to a very\ngreat height, and did not divide from each other till close to the top,\nwhere their summits formed a row of conical battlements all around the\nwalls. The space contained was a parallelogram of great length. Along\neach of the two longer sides of the interior, were ranged three ranks\nof men, in white robes, standing silent and solemn, each with a sword by\nhis side, although the rest of his costume and bearing was more priestly\nthan soldierly. For some distance inwards, the space between these\nopposite rows was filled with a company of men and women and children,\nin holiday attire. The looks of all were directed inwards, towards the\nfurther end. Far beyond the crowd, in a long avenue, seeming to narrow\nin the distance, went the long rows of the white-robed men. On what the\nattention of the multitude was fixed, we could not tell, for the sun had\nset before we arrived, and it was growing dark within. It grew darker\nand darker. The multitude waited in silence. The stars began to shine\ndown into the enclosure, and they grew brighter and larger every moment.\nA wind arose, and swayed the pinnacles of the tree-tops; and made a\nstrange sound, half like music, half like moaning, through the close\nbranches and leaves of the tree-walls. A young girl who stood beside me,\nclothed in the same dress as the priests, bowed her head, and grew pale\nwith awe.\n\nThe knight whispered to me, “How solemn it is! Surely they wait to hear\nthe voice of a prophet. There is something good near!”\n\nBut I, though somewhat shaken by the feeling expressed by my master,\nyet had an unaccountable conviction that here was something bad. So I\nresolved to be keenly on the watch for what should follow.\n\nSuddenly a great star, like a sun, appeared high in the air over the\ntemple, illuminating it throughout; and a great song arose from the men\nin white, which went rolling round and round the building, now receding\nto the end, and now approaching, down the other side, the place where we\nstood. For some of the singers were regularly ceasing, and the next\nto them as regularly taking up the song, so that it crept onwards with\ngradations produced by changes which could not themselves be detected,\nfor only a few of those who were singing ceased at the same moment. The\nsong paused; and I saw a company of six of the white-robed men walk up\nthe centre of the human avenue, surrounding a youth gorgeously attired\nbeneath his robe of white, and wearing a chaplet of flowers on his\nhead. I followed them closely, with my keenest observation; and, by\naccompanying their slow progress with my eyes, I was able to perceive\nmore clearly what took place when they arrived at the other end. I knew\nthat my sight was so much more keen than that of most people, that I had\ngood reason to suppose I should see more than the rest could, at such a\ndistance. At the farther end a throne stood upon a platform, high above\nthe heads of the surrounding priests. To this platform I saw the company\nbegin to ascend, apparently by an inclined plane or gentle slope. The\nthrone itself was elevated again, on a kind of square pedestal, to the\ntop of which led a flight of steps. On the throne sat a majestic-looking\nfigure, whose posture seemed to indicate a mixture of pride and\nbenignity, as he looked down on the multitude below. The company\nascended to the foot of the throne, where they all kneeled for some\nminutes; then they rose and passed round to the side of the pedestal\nupon which the throne stood. Here they crowded close behind the youth,\nputting him in the foremost place, and one of them opened a door in the\npedestal, for the youth to enter. I was sure I saw him shrink back, and\nthose crowding behind pushed him in. Then, again, arose a burst of song\nfrom the multitude in white, which lasted some time. When it ceased,\na new company of seven commenced its march up the centre. As they\nadvanced, I looked up at my master: his noble countenance was full of\nreverence and awe. Incapable of evil himself, he could scarcely suspect\nit in another, much less in a multitude such as this, and surrounded\nwith such appearances of solemnity. I was certain it was the really\ngrand accompaniments that overcame him; that the stars overhead, the\ndark towering tops of the yew-trees, and the wind that, like an unseen\nspirit, sighed through their branches, bowed his spirit to the belief,\nthat in all these ceremonies lay some great mystical meaning which, his\nhumility told him, his ignorance prevented him from understanding.\n\nMore convinced than before, that there was evil here, I could not endure\nthat my master should be deceived; that one like him, so pure and noble,\nshould respect what, if my suspicions were true, was worse than the\nordinary deceptions of priestcraft. I could not tell how far he might be\nled to countenance, and otherwise support their doings, before he should\nfind cause to repent bitterly of his error. I watched the new procession\nyet more keenly, if possible, than the former. This time, the central\nfigure was a girl; and, at the close, I observed, yet more indubitably,\nthe shrinking back, and the crowding push. What happened to the victims,\nI never learned; but I had learned enough, and I could bear it no\nlonger. I stooped, and whispered to the young girl who stood by me, to\nlend me her white garment. I wanted it, that I might not be entirely\nout of keeping with the solemnity, but might have at least this help to\npassing unquestioned. She looked up, half-amused and half-bewildered, as\nif doubting whether I was in earnest or not. But in her perplexity, she\npermitted me to unfasten it, and slip it down from her shoulders.\n\nI easily got possession of it; and, sinking down on my knees in the\ncrowd, I rose apparently in the habit of one of the worshippers.\n\nGiving my battle-axe to the girl, to hold in pledge for the return of\nher stole, for I wished to test the matter unarmed, and, if it was a man\nthat sat upon the throne, to attack him with hands bare, as I supposed\nhis must be, I made my way through the crowd to the front, while the\nsinging yet continued, desirous of reaching the platform while it was\nunoccupied by any of the priests. I was permitted to walk up the long\navenue of white robes unmolested, though I saw questioning looks in many\nof the faces as I passed. I presume my coolness aided my passage; for\nI felt quite indifferent as to my own fate; not feeling, after the\nlate events of my history, that I was at all worth taking care of; and\nenjoying, perhaps, something of an evil satisfaction, in the revenge\nI was thus taking upon the self which had fooled me so long. When I\narrived on the platform, the song had just ceased, and I felt as if all\nwere looking towards me. But instead of kneeling at its foot, I walked\nright up the stairs to the throne, laid hold of a great wooden image\nthat seemed to sit upon it, and tried to hurl it from its seat. In this\nI failed at first, for I found it firmly fixed. But in dread lest, the\nfirst shock of amazement passing away, the guards would rush upon me\nbefore I had effected my purpose, I strained with all my might; and,\nwith a noise as of the cracking, and breaking, and tearing of rotten\nwood, something gave way, and I hurled the image down the steps. Its\ndisplacement revealed a great hole in the throne, like the hollow of a\ndecayed tree, going down apparently a great way. But I had no time to\nexamine it, for, as I looked into it, up out of it rushed a great brute,\nlike a wolf, but twice the size, and tumbled me headlong with itself,\ndown the steps of the throne. As we fell, however, I caught it by the\nthroat, and the moment we reached the platform, a struggle commenced, in\nwhich I soon got uppermost, with my hand upon its throat, and knee upon\nits heart. But now arose a wild cry of wrath and revenge and rescue.\nA universal hiss of steel, as every sword was swept from its scabbard,\nseemed to tear the very air in shreds. I heard the rush of hundreds\ntowards the platform on which I knelt. I only tightened my grasp of the\nbrute’s throat. His eyes were already starting from his head, and his\ntongue was hanging out. My anxious hope was, that, even after they had\nkilled me, they would be unable to undo my gripe of his throat, before\nthe monster was past breathing. I therefore threw all my will, and\nforce, and purpose, into the grasping hand. I remember no blow. A\nfaintness came over me, and my consciousness departed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\n        “We are ne’er like angels till our passions die.”\n                                        DEKKER.\n\n        “This wretched INN, where we scarce stay to bait,\n                 We call our DWELLING-PLACE:\n                 We call one STEP A RACE:\n         But angels in their full enlightened state,\n         Angels, who LIVE, and know what ‘tis to BE,\n         Who all the nonsense of our language see,\n         Who speak THINGS, and our WORDS,their ill-drawn\n              PICTURES, scorn,\n            When we, by a foolish figure, say,\n            BEHOLD AN OLD MAN DEAD! then they\n         Speak properly, and cry, BEHOLD A MAN-CHILD BORN!”\n                                              COWLEY.\n\nI was dead, and right content. I lay in my coffin, with my hands folded\nin peace. The knight, and the lady I loved, wept over me.\n\nHer tears fell on my face.\n\n“Ah!” said the knight, “I rushed amongst them like a madman. I hewed\nthem down like brushwood. Their swords battered on me like hail, but\nhurt me not. I cut a lane through to my friend. He was dead. But he had\nthrottled the monster, and I had to cut the handful out of its throat,\nbefore I could disengage and carry off his body. They dared not molest\nme as I brought him back.”\n\n“He has died well,” said the lady.\n\nMy spirit rejoiced. They left me to my repose. I felt as if a cool hand\nhad been laid upon my heart, and had stilled it. My soul was like a\nsummer evening, after a heavy fall of rain, when the drops are yet\nglistening on the trees in the last rays of the down-going sun, and the\nwind of the twilight has begun to blow. The hot fever of life had gone\nby, and I breathed the clear mountain-air of the land of Death. I had\nnever dreamed of such blessedness. It was not that I had in any way\nceased to be what I had been. The very fact that anything can die,\nimplies the existence of something that cannot die; which must either\ntake to itself another form, as when the seed that is sown dies, and\narises again; or, in conscious existence, may, perhaps, continue to\nlead a purely spiritual life. If my passions were dead, the souls of\nthe passions, those essential mysteries of the spirit which had imbodied\nthemselves in the passions, and had given to them all their glory and\nwonderment, yet lived, yet glowed, with a pure, undying fire. They rose\nabove their vanishing earthly garments, and disclosed themselves angels\nof light. But oh, how beautiful beyond the old form! I lay thus for\na time, and lived as it were an unradiating existence; my soul a\nmotionless lake, that received all things and gave nothing back;\nsatisfied in still contemplation, and spiritual consciousness.\n\nEre long, they bore me to my grave. Never tired child lay down in his\nwhite bed, and heard the sound of his playthings being laid aside for\nthe night, with a more luxurious satisfaction of repose than I knew,\nwhen I felt the coffin settle on the firm earth, and heard the sound of\nthe falling mould upon its lid. It has not the same hollow rattle within\nthe coffin, that it sends up to the edge of the grave. They buried me\nin no graveyard. They loved me too much for that, I thank them; but they\nlaid me in the grounds of their own castle, amid many trees; where, as\nit was spring-time, were growing primroses, and blue-bells, and all the\nfamilies of the woods\n\nNow that I lay in her bosom, the whole earth, and each of her many\nbirths, was as a body to me, at my will. I seemed to feel the great\nheart of the mother beating into mine, and feeding me with her own life,\nher own essential being and nature. I heard the footsteps of my friends\nabove, and they sent a thrill through my heart. I knew that the helpers\nhad gone, and that the knight and the lady remained, and spoke low,\ngentle, tearful words of him who lay beneath the yet wounded sod. I rose\ninto a single large primrose that grew by the edge of the grave,\nand from the window of its humble, trusting face, looked full in the\ncountenance of the lady. I felt that I could manifest myself in the\nprimrose; that it said a part of what I wanted to say; just as in the\nold time, I had used to betake myself to a song for the same end. The\nflower caught her eye. She stooped and plucked it, saying, “Oh, you\nbeautiful creature!” and, lightly kissing it, put it in her bosom. It\nwas the first kiss she had ever given me. But the flower soon began to\nwither, and I forsook it.\n\nIt was evening. The sun was below the horizon; but his rosy beams yet\nilluminated a feathery cloud, that floated high above the world. I\narose, I reached the cloud; and, throwing myself upon it, floated with\nit in sight of the sinking sun. He sank, and the cloud grew gray; but\nthe grayness touched not my heart. It carried its rose-hue within;\nfor now I could love without needing to be loved again. The moon came\ngliding up with all the past in her wan face. She changed my couch into\na ghostly pallor, and threw all the earth below as to the bottom of a\npale sea of dreams. But she could not make me sad. I knew now, that it\nis by loving, and not by being loved, that one can come nearest the soul\nof another; yea, that, where two love, it is the loving of each other,\nand not the being loved by each other, that originates and perfects and\nassures their blessedness. I knew that love gives to him that loveth,\npower over any soul beloved, even if that soul know him not, bringing\nhim inwardly close to that spirit; a power that cannot be but for good;\nfor in proportion as selfishness intrudes, the love ceases, and the\npower which springs therefrom dies. Yet all love will, one day, meet\nwith its return. All true love will, one day, behold its own image in\nthe eyes of the beloved, and be humbly glad. This is possible in the\nrealms of lofty Death. “Ah! my friends,” thought I, “how I will tend\nyou, and wait upon you, and haunt you with my love.”\n\n“My floating chariot bore me over a great city. Its faint dull sound\nsteamed up into the air--a sound--how composed?” How many hopeless\ncries,” thought I, “and how many mad shouts go to make up the tumult,\nhere so faint where I float in eternal peace, knowing that they will\none day be stilled in the surrounding calm, and that despair dies into\ninfinite hope, and the seeming impossible there, is the law here!\n\n“But, O pale-faced women, and gloomy-browed men, and forgotten children,\nhow I will wait on you, and minister to you, and, putting my arms about\nyou in the dark, think hope into your hearts, when you fancy no one is\nnear! Soon as my senses have all come back, and have grown accustomed to\nthis new blessed life, I will be among you with the love that healeth.”\n\nWith this, a pang and a terrible shudder went through me; a writhing\nas of death convulsed me; and I became once again conscious of a more\nlimited, even a bodily and earthly life.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\n        “Our life is no dream; but it ought to become one,\n          and perhaps will.”--NOVALIS.\n\n            “And on the ground, which is my modres gate,\n            I knocke with my staf; erlich and late,\n            And say to hire, Leve mother, let me in.”\n                        CHAUCER, The Pardoneres Tale.\n\nSinking from such a state of ideal bliss, into the world of shadows\nwhich again closed around and infolded me, my first dread was, not\nunnaturally, that my own shadow had found me again, and that my torture\nhad commenced anew. It was a sad revulsion of feeling. This, indeed,\nseemed to correspond to what we think death is, before we die. Yet I\nfelt within me a power of calm endurance to which I had hitherto been\na stranger. For, in truth, that I should be able if only to think such\nthings as I had been thinking, was an unspeakable delight. An hour of\nsuch peace made the turmoil of a lifetime worth striving through.\n\nI found myself lying in the open air, in the early morning, before\nsunrise. Over me rose the summer heaven, expectant of the sun. The\nclouds already saw him, coming from afar; and soon every dewdrop would\nrejoice in his individual presence within it.\n\nI lay motionless for a few minutes; and then slowly rose and looked\nabout me. I was on the summit of a little hill; a valley lay beneath,\nand a range of mountains closed up the view upon that side. But, to my\nhorror, across the valley, and up the height of the opposing mountains,\nstretched, from my very feet, a hugely expanding shade. There it lay,\nlong and large, dark and mighty. I turned away with a sick despair; when\nlo! I beheld the sun just lifting his head above the eastern hill,\nand the shadow that fell from me, lay only where his beams fell not. I\ndanced for joy. It was only the natural shadow, that goes with every man\nwho walks in the sun. As he arose, higher and higher, the shadow-head\nsank down the side of the opposite hill, and crept in across the valley\ntowards my feet.\n\nNow that I was so joyously delivered from this fear, I saw and\nrecognised the country around me. In the valley below, lay my own\ncastle, and the haunts of my childhood were all about me hastened home.\nMy sisters received me with unspeakable joy; but I suppose they observed\nsome change in me, for a kind of respect, with a slight touch of awe in\nit, mingled with their joy, and made me ashamed. They had been in great\ndistress about me. On the morning of my disappearance, they had found\nthe floor of my room flooded; and, all that day, a wondrous and nearly\nimpervious mist had hung about the castle and grounds. I had been gone,\nthey told me, twenty-one days. To me it seemed twenty-one years. Nor\ncould I yet feel quite secure in my new experiences. When, at night, I\nlay down once more in my own bed, I did not feel at all sure that when I\nawoke, I should not find myself in some mysterious region of Fairy Land.\nMy dreams were incessant and perturbed; but when I did awake, I saw\nclearly that I was in my own home.\n\nMy mind soon grew calm; and I began the duties of my new position,\nsomewhat instructed, I hoped, by the adventures that had befallen me in\nFairy Land. Could I translate the experience of my travels there, into\ncommon life? This was the question. Or must I live it all over again,\nand learn it all over again, in the other forms that belong to the world\nof men, whose experience yet runs parallel to that of Fairy Land? These\nquestions I cannot answer yet. But I fear.\n\nEven yet, I find myself looking round sometimes with anxiety, to see\nwhether my shadow falls right away from the sun or no. I have never yet\ndiscovered any inclination to either side. And if I am not unfrequently\nsad, I yet cast no more of a shade on the earth, than most men who have\nlived in it as long as I. I have a strange feeling sometimes, that I am\na ghost, sent into the world to minister to my fellow men, or, rather,\nto repair the wrongs I have already done.\n\nMay the world be brighter for me, at least in those portions of it,\nwhere my darkness falls not.\n\nThus I, who set out to find my Ideal, came back rejoicing that I had\nlost my Shadow.\n\nWhen the thought of the blessedness I experienced, after my death in\nFairy Land, is too high for me to lay hold upon it and hope in it,\nI often think of the wise woman in the cottage, and of her solemn\nassurance that she knew something too good to be told. When I am\noppressed by any sorrow or real perplexity, I often feel as if I had\nonly left her cottage for a time, and would soon return out of the\nvision, into it again. Sometimes, on such occasions, I find myself,\nunconsciously almost, looking about for the mystic mark of red, with\nthe vague hope of entering her door, and being comforted by her wise\ntenderness. I then console myself by saying: “I have come through the\ndoor of Dismay; and the way back from the world into which that has led\nme, is through my tomb. Upon that the red sign lies, and I shall find it\none day, and be glad.”\n\nI will end my story with the relation of an incident which befell me a\nfew days ago. I had been with my reapers, and, when they ceased their\nwork at noon, I had lain down under the shadow of a great, ancient\nbeech-tree, that stood on the edge of the field. As I lay, with my eyes\nclosed, I began to listen to the sound of the leaves overhead. At first,\nthey made sweet inarticulate music alone; but, by-and-by, the sound\nseemed to begin to take shape, and to be gradually moulding itself into\nwords; till, at last, I seemed able to distinguish these, half-dissolved\nin a little ocean of circumfluent tones: “A great good is coming--is\ncoming--is coming to thee, Anodos;” and so over and over again. I\nfancied that the sound reminded me of the voice of the ancient woman, in\nthe cottage that was four-square. I opened my eyes, and, for a moment,\nalmost believed that I saw her face, with its many wrinkles and its\nyoung eyes, looking at me from between two hoary branches of the beech\noverhead. But when I looked more keenly, I saw only twigs and leaves,\nand the infinite sky, in tiny spots, gazing through between. Yet I know\nthat good is coming to me--that good is always coming; though few have\nat all times the simplicity and the courage to believe it. What we\ncall evil, is the only and best shape, which, for the person and his\ncondition at the time, could be assumed by the best good. And so,\nFAREWELL."
