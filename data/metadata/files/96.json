His slender frame shook, as with ague,\nand at times was racked by a convulsive shudder.  A sudden step upon\nthe stairway leading to his workshop brought him trembling and wide\neyed to his feet, staring fearfully at the locked and bolted door.\n\nAlthough he knew perfectly well whose the advancing footfalls were, he\nwas all but overcome by the madness of apprehension as they came softly\nnearer and nearer to the barred door.  At last they halted before it,\nto be followed by a gentle knock.\n\n\"Daddy!\" came the sweet tones of a girl's voice.\n\nThe man made an effort to take a firm grasp upon himself that no\ntell-tale evidence of his emotion might be betrayed in his speech.\n\n\"Daddy!\" called the girl again, a trace of anxiety in her voice this\ntime.  \"What IS the matter with you, and what ARE you doing?  You've\nbeen shut up in that hateful old room for three days now without a\nmorsel to eat, and in all likelihood without a wink of sleep.  You'll\nkill yourself with your stuffy old experiments.\"\n\nThe man's face softened.\n\n\"Don't worry about me, sweetheart,\" he replied in a well controlled\nvoice.  \"I'll soon be through now--soon be through--and then we'll go\naway for a long vacation--for a long vacation.\"\n\n\"I'll give you until noon, Daddy,\" said the girl in a voice which\ncarried a more strongly defined tone of authority than her father's\nsoft drawl, \"and then I shall come into that room, if I have to use an\naxe, and bring you out--do you understand?\"\n\nProfessor Maxon smiled wanly.  He knew that his daughter was equal to\nher threat.\n\n\"All right, sweetheart, I'll be through by noon for sure--by noon for\nsure.  Run along and play now, like a good little girl.\"\n\nVirginia Maxon shrugged her shapely shoulders and shook her head\nhopelessly at the forbidding panels of the door.\n\n\"My dolls are all dressed for the day,\" she cried, \"and I'm tired of\nmaking mud pies--I want you to come out and play with me.\"  But\nProfessor Maxon did not reply--he had returned to view his grim\noperations, and the hideousness of them had closed his ears to the\nsweet tones of the girl's voice.\n\nAs she turned to retrace her steps to the floor below Miss Maxon still\nshook her head.\n\n\"Poor old Daddy,\" she mused, \"were I a thousand years old, wrinkled and\ntoothless, he would still look upon me as his baby girl.\"\n\nIf you chance to be an alumnus of Cornell you may recall Professor\nArthur Maxon, a quiet, slender, white-haired gentleman, who for several\nyears was an assistant professor in one of the departments of natural\nscience.  Wealthy by inheritance, he had chosen the field of education\nfor his life work solely from a desire to be of some material benefit\nto mankind since the meager salary which accompanied his professorship\nwas not of sufficient import to influence him in the slightest degree.\n\nAlways keenly interested in biology, his almost unlimited means had\npermitted him to undertake, in secret, a series of daring experiments\nwhich had carried him so far in advance of the biologists of his day\nthat he had, while others were still groping blindly for the secret of\nlife, actually reproduced by chemical means the great phenomenon.\n\nFully alive to the gravity and responsibilities of his marvellous\ndiscovery he had kept the results of his experimentation, and even the\nexperiments themselves, a profound secret not only from his colleagues,\nbut from his only daughter, who heretofore had shared his every hope\nand aspiration.\n\nIt was the very success of his last and most pretentious effort that\nhad placed him in the horrifying predicament in which he now found\nhimself--with the corpse of what was apparently a human being in his\nworkshop and no available explanation that could possibly be acceptable\nto a matter-of-fact and unscientific police.\n\nHad he told them the truth they would have laughed at him.  Had he\nsaid: \"This is not a human being that you see, but the remains of a\nchemically produced counterfeit created in my own laboratory,\" they\nwould have smiled, and either hanged him or put him away with the other\ncriminally insane.\n\nThis phase of the many possibilities which he had realized might be\ncontingent upon even the partial success of his work alone had escaped\nhis consideration, so that the first wave of triumphant exultation with\nwhich he had viewed the finished result of this last experiment had\nbeen succeeded by overwhelming consternation as he saw the thing which\nhe had created gasp once or twice with the feeble spark of life with\nwhich he had endowed it, and expire--leaving upon his hands the corpse\nof what was, to all intent and purpose, a human being, albeit a most\ngrotesque and misshapen thing.\n\nUntil nearly noon Professor Maxon was occupied in removing the\nremaining stains and evidences of his gruesome work, but when he at\nlast turned the key in the door of his workshop it was to leave behind\nno single trace of the successful result of his years of labor.\n\nThe following afternoon found him and Virginia crossing the station\nplatform to board the express for New York.  So quietly had their plans\nbeen made that not a friend was at the train to bid them farewell--the\nscientist felt that he could not bear the strain of attempting\nexplanations at this time.\n\nBut there were those there who recognized them, and one especially who\nnoted the lithe, trim figure and beautiful face of Virginia Maxon\nthough he did not know even the name of their possessor.  It was a tall\nwell built young man who nudged one of his younger companions as the\ngirl crossed the platform to enter her Pullman.\n\n\"I say, Dexter,\" he exclaimed, \"who is that beauty?\"\n\nThe one addressed turned in the direction indicated by his friend.\n\n\"By jove!\" he exclaimed.  \"Why it's Virginia Maxon and the professor,\nher father.  Now where do you suppose they're going?\"\n\n\"I don't know--now,\" replied the first speaker, Townsend J. Harper,\nJr., in a half whisper, \"but I'll bet you a new car that I find out.\"\n\n\nA week later, with failing health and shattered nerves, Professor Maxon\nsailed with his daughter for a long ocean voyage, which he hoped would\naid him in rapid recuperation, and permit him to forget the nightmare\nmemory of those three horrible days and nights in his workshop.\n\nHe believed that he had reached an unalterable decision never again to\nmeddle with the mighty, awe inspiring secrets of creation; but with\nreturning health and balance he found himself viewing his recent\ntriumph with feelings of renewed hope and anticipation.\n\nThe morbid fears superinduced by the shock following the sudden demise\nof the first creature of his experiments had given place to a growing\ndesire to further prosecute his labors until enduring success had\ncrowned his efforts with an achievement which he might exhibit with\npride to the scientific world.\n\nHis recent disastrous success had convinced him that neither Ithaca nor\nany other abode of civilization was a safe place to continue his\nexperiments, but it was not until their cruising had brought them among\nthe multitudinous islands of the East Indies that the plan occurred to\nhim that he finally adopted--a plan the outcome of which could he then\nhave foreseen would have sent him scurrying to the safety of his own\ncountry with the daughter who was to bear the full brunt of the horrors\nit entailed.\n\nThey were steaming up the China Sea when the idea first suggested\nitself, and as he sat idly during the long, hot days the thought grew\nupon him, expanding into a thousand wonderful possibilities, until it\nbecame crystalized into what was a little short of an obsession.\n\nThe result was that at Manila, much to Virginia's surprise, he\nannounced the abandonment of the balance of their purposed voyage,\ntaking immediate return passage to Singapore.  His daughter did not\nquestion him as to the cause of this change in plans, for since those\nthree days that her father had kept himself locked in his workroom at\nhome the girl had noticed a subtle change in her parent--a marked\ndisinclination to share with her his every confidence as had been his\ncustom since the death of her mother.\n\nWhile it grieved her immeasurably she was both too proud and too hurt\nto sue for a reestablishment of the old relations.  On all other topics\nthan his scientific work their interests were as mutual as formerly,\nbut by what seemed a manner of tacit agreement this subject was taboo.\nAnd so it was that they came to Singapore without the girl having the\nslightest conception of her father's plans.\n\nHere they spent nearly a month, during which time Professor Maxon was\ndaily engaged in interviewing officials, English residents and a motley\nhorde of Malays and Chinamen.\n\nVirginia met socially several of the men with whom her father was\nengaged but it was only at the last moment that one of them let drop a\nhint of the purpose of the month's activity.  When Virginia was present\nthe conversation seemed always deftly guided from the subject of her\nfather's immediate future, and she was not long in discerning that it\nwas in no sense through accident that this was true.  Thereafter her\nwounded pride made easy the task of those who seemed combined to keep\nher in ignorance.\n\nIt was a Dr. von Horn, who had been oftenest with her father, who gave\nher the first intimation of what was forthcoming.  Afterward, in\nrecollecting the conversation, it seemed to Virginia that the young man\nhad been directed to break the news to her, that her father might be\nspared the ordeal.  It was evident then that he expected opposition,\nbut the girl was too loyal to let von Horn know if she felt other than\nin harmony with the proposal, and too proud to evince by surprise the\nfact that she was not wholly conversant with its every detail.\n\n\"You are glad to be leaving Singapore so soon?\" he had asked, although\nhe knew that she had not been advised that an early departure was\nplanned.\n\n\"I am rather looking forward to it,\" replied Virginia.\n\n\"And to a protracted residence on one of the Pamarung Islands?\"\ncontinued von Horn.\n\n\"Why not?\" was her rather non-committal reply, though she had not the\nremotest idea of their location.\n\nVon Horn admired her nerve though he rather wished that she would ask\nsome questions--it was difficult making progress in this way.  How\ncould he explain the plans when she evinced not the slightest sign that\nshe was not already entirely conversant with them?\n\n\"We doubt if the work will be completed under two or three years,\"\nanswered the doctor.  \"That will be a long time in which to be isolated\nupon a savage little speck of land off the larger but no less savage\nBorneo.  Do you think that your bravery is equal to the demands that\nwill be made upon it?\"\n\nVirginia laughed, nor was there the slightest tremor in its note.\n\n\"I am equal to whatever fate my father is equal to,\" she said, \"nor do\nI think that a life upon one of these beautiful little islands would be\nmuch of a hardship--certainly not if it will help to promote the\nsuccess of his scientific experiments.\"\n\nShe used the last words on a chance that she might have hit upon the\ntrue reason for the contemplated isolation from civilization.  They had\nserved their purpose too in deceiving von Horn who was now half\nconvinced that Professor Maxon must have divulged more of their plans\nto his daughter than he had led the medical man to believe.  Perceiving\nher advantage from the expression on the young man's face, Virginia\nfollowed it up in an endeavor to elicit the details.\n\nThe result of her effort was the knowledge that on the second day they\nwere to sail for the Pamarung Islands upon a small schooner which her\nfather had purchased, with a crew of Malays and lascars, and von Horn,\nwho had served in the American navy, in command.  The precise point of\ndestination was still undecided--the plan being to search out a\nsuitable location upon one of the many little islets which dot the\nwestern shore of the Macassar Strait.\n\nOf the many men Virginia had met during the month at Singapore von Horn\nhad been by far the most interesting and companionable.  Such time as\nhe could find from the many duties which had devolved upon him in the\nmatter of obtaining and outfitting the schooner, and signing her two\nmates and crew of fifteen, had been spent with his employer's daughter.\n\nThe girl was rather glad that he was to be a member of their little\ncompany, for she had found him a much travelled man and an interesting\ntalker with none of the, to her, disgusting artificialities of the\nprofessional ladies' man.  He talked to her as he might have talked to\na man, of the things that interest intelligent people regardless of sex.\n\nThere was never any suggestion of familiarity in his manner; nor in his\nchoice of topics did he ever ignore the fact that she was a young girl.\nShe had felt entirely at ease in his society from the first evening\nthat she had met him, and their acquaintance had grown to a very\nsensible friendship by the time of the departure of the Ithaca--the\nrechristened schooner which was to carry them away to an unguessed fate.\n\nThe voyage from Singapore to the Islands was without incident.\nVirginia took a keen delight in watching the Malays and lascars at\ntheir work, telling von Horn that she had to draw upon her imagination\nbut little to picture herself a captive upon a pirate ship--the half\nnaked men, the gaudy headdress, the earrings, and the fierce\ncountenances of many of the crew furnishing only too realistically the\nnecessary savage setting.\n\nA week spent among the Pamarung Islands disclosed no suitable site for\nthe professor's camp, nor was it until they had cruised up the coast\nseveral miles north of the equator and Cape Santang that they found a\ntiny island a few miles off the coast opposite the mouth of a small\nriver--an island which fulfilled in every detail their requirements.\n\nIt was uninhabited, fertile and possessed a clear, sweet brook which\nhad its source in a cold spring in the higher land at the island's\ncenter.  Here it was that the Ithaca came to anchor in a little harbor,\nwhile her crew under von Horn, and the Malay first mate, Bududreen,\naccompanied Professor Maxon in search of a suitable location for a\npermanent camp.\n\nThe cook, a harmless old Chinaman, and Virginia were left in sole\npossession of the Ithaca.\n\nTwo hours after the departure of the men into the jungle Virginia heard\nthe fall of axes on timber and knew that the site of her future home\nhad been chosen and the work of clearing begun.  She sat musing on the\nstrange freak which had prompted her father to bury them in this savage\ncorner of the globe; and as she pondered there came a wistful\nexpression to her eyes, and an unwonted sadness drooped the corners of\nher mouth.\n\nOf a sudden she realized how wide had become the gulf between them now.\nSo imperceptibly had it grown since those three horrid days in Ithaca\njust prior to their departure for what was to have been but a few\nmonths' cruise that she had not until now comprehended that the old\nrelations of open, good-fellowship had gone, possibly forever.\n\nHad she needed proof of the truth of her sad discovery it had been\nenough to point to the single fact that her father had brought her here\nto this little island without making the slightest attempt to explain\nthe nature of his expedition.  She had gleaned enough from von Horn to\nunderstand that some important scientific experiments were to be\nundertaken; but what their nature she could not imagine, for she had\nnot the slightest conception of the success that had crowned her\nfather's last experiment at Ithaca, although she had for years known of\nhis keen interest in the subject.\n\nThe girl became aware also of other subtle changes in her father.  He\nhad long since ceased to be the jovial, carefree companion who had\nshared with her her every girlish joy and sorrow and in whom she had\nconfided both the trivial and momentous secrets of her childhood.  He\nhad become not exactly morose, but rather moody and absorbed, so that\nshe had of late never found an opportunity for the cozy chats that had\nformerly meant so much to them both.  There had been too, recently, a\nstrange lack of consideration for herself that had wounded her more\nthan she had imagined.  Today there had been a glaring example of it in\nhis having left her alone upon the boat without a single European\ncompanion--something that he would never have thought of doing a few\nmonths before.\n\nAs she sat speculating on the strange change which had come over her\nfather her eyes had wandered aimlessly along the harbor's entrance; the\nlow reef that protected it from the sea, and the point of land to the\nsouth, that projected far out into the strait like a gigantic index\nfinger pointing toward the mainland, the foliage covered heights of\nwhich were just visible above the western horizon.\n\nPresently her attention was arrested by a tossing speck far out upon\nthe rolling bosom of the strait.  For some time the girl watched the\nobject until at length it resolved itself into a boat moving head on\ntoward the island.  Later she saw that it was long and low, propelled\nby a single sail and many oars, and that it carried quite a company.\n\nThinking it but a native trading boat, so many of which ply the\nsouthern seas, Virginia viewed its approach with but idle curiosity.\nWhen it had come to within half a mile of the anchorage of the Ithaca,\nand was about to enter the mouth of the harbor Sing Lee's eyes chanced\nto fall upon it.  On the instant the old Chinaman was electrified into\nsudden and astounding action.\n\n\"Klick!  Klick!\" he cried, running toward Virginia.  \"Go b'low, klick.\"\n\n\"Why should I go below, Sing?\" queried the girl, amazed by the demeanor\nof the cook.\n\n\"Klick!  Klick!\" he urged grasping her by the arm--half leading, half\ndragging her toward the companion-way.  \"Plilates!  Mlalay\nplilates--Dyak plilates.\"\n\n\"Pirates!\" gasped Virginia.  \"Oh Sing, what can we do?\"\n\n\"You go b'low.  Mebbyso Sing flighten 'em.  Shoot cannon.  Bling help.\nMaxon come klick.  Bling men.  Chase'm 'way,\" explained the Chinaman.\n\"But plilates see 'em pletty white girl,\" he shrugged his shoulders and\nshook his head dubiously, \"then old Sing no can flighten 'em 'way.\"\n\nThe girl shuddered, and crouching close behind Sing hurried below.  A\nmoment later she heard the boom of the old brass six pounder which for\nmany years had graced the Ithaca's stern.  In the bow Professor Maxon\nhad mounted a modern machine gun, but this was quite beyond Sing's\nsimple gunnery.  The Chinaman had not taken the time to sight the\nancient weapon carefully, but a gleeful smile lit his wrinkled, yellow\nface as he saw the splash of the ball where it struck the water almost\nat the side of the prahu.\n\nSing realized that the boat might contain friendly natives, but he had\ncruised these waters too many years to take chances.  Better kill a\nhundred friends, he thought, than be captured by a single pirate.\n\nAt the shot the prahu slowed up, and a volley of musketry from her crew\nsatisfied Sing that he had made no mistake in classifying her.  Her\nfire fell short as did the ball from the small cannon mounted in her\nbow.\n\nVirginia was watching the prahu from one of the cabin ports.  She saw\nthe momentary hesitation and confusion which followed Sing's first\nshot, and then to her dismay she saw the rowers bend to their oars\nagain and the prahu move swiftly in the direction of the Ithaca.\n\nIt was apparent that the pirates had perceived the almost defenseless\ncondition of the schooner.  In a few minutes they would be swarming the\ndeck, for poor old Sing would be entirely helpless to repel them.  If\nDr. von Horn were only there, thought the distracted girl.  With the\nmachine gun alone he might keep them off.\n\nAt the thought of the machine gun a sudden resolve gripped her.  Why\nnot man it herself?  Von Horn had explained its mechanism to her in\ndetail, and on one occasion had allowed her to operate it on the voyage\nfrom Singapore.  With the thought came action.  Running to the magazine\nshe snatched up a feed-belt, and in another moment was on deck beside\nthe astonished Sing.\n\nThe pirates were skimming rapidly across the smooth waters of the\nharbor, answering Sing's harmless shots with yells of derision and\nwild, savage war cries.  There were, perhaps, fifty Dyaks and\nMalays--fierce, barbaric men; mostly naked to the waist, or with\nwar-coats of brilliant colors.  The savage headdress of the Dyaks, the\nlong, narrow, decorated shields, the flashing blades of parang and kris\nsent a shudder through the girl, so close they seemed beneath the\nschooner's side.\n\n\"What do?  What do?\" cried Sing in consternation.  \"Go b'low.  Klick!\"\nBut before he had finished his exhortation Virginia was racing toward\nthe bow where the machine gun was mounted.  Tearing the cover from it\nshe swung the muzzle toward the pirate prahu, which by now was nearly\nwithin range above the vessel's side--a moment more and she would be\ntoo close to use the weapon upon the pirates.\n\nVirginia was quick to perceive the necessity for haste, while the\npirates at the same instant realized the menace of the new danger which\nconfronted them.  A score of muskets belched forth their missiles at\nthe fearless girl behind the scant shield of the machine gun.  Leaden\npellets rained heavily upon her protection, or whizzed threateningly\nabout her head--and then she got the gun into action.\n\nAt the rate of fifty a minute, a stream of projectiles tore into the\nbow of the prahu when suddenly a richly garbed Malay in the stern rose\nto his feet waving a white cloth upon the point of his kris.  It was\nthe Rajah Muda Saffir--he had seen the girl's face and at the sight of\nit the blood lust in his breast had been supplanted by another.\n\nAt sight of the emblem of peace Virginia ceased firing.  She saw the\ntall Malay issue a few commands, the oarsmen bent to their work, the\nprahu came about, making off toward the harbor's entrance.  At the same\nmoment there was a shot from the shore followed by loud yelling, and\nthe girl turned to see her father and von Horn pulling rapidly toward\nthe Ithaca.\n\n\n\n2\n\nTHE HEAVY CHEST\n\n\nVirginia and Sing were compelled to narrate the adventure of the\nafternoon a dozen times.  The Chinaman was at a loss to understand what\nhad deterred the pirates at the very threshold of victory.  Von Horn\nthought that they had seen the reinforcements embarking from the shore,\nbut Sing explained that that was impossible since the Ithaca had been\ndirectly between them and the point at which the returning crew had\nentered the boats.\n\nVirginia was positive that her fusillade had frightened them into a\nhasty retreat, but again Sing discouraged any such idea when he pointed\nto the fact that another instant would have carried the prahu close to\nthe Ithaca's side and out of the machine gun's radius of action.\n\nThe old Chinaman was positive that the pirates had some ulterior motive\nfor simulating defeat, and his long years of experience upon pirate\ninfested waters gave weight to his opinion.  The weak spot in his\nargument was his inability to suggest a reasonable motive.  And so it\nwas that for a long time they were left to futile conjecture as to the\naction that had saved them from a bloody encounter with these\nbloodthirsty sea wolves.\n\nFor a week the men were busy constructing the new camp, but never again\nwas Virginia left without a sufficient guard for her protection.  Von\nHorn was always needed at the work, for to him had fallen the entire\ndirection of matters of importance that were at all of a practical\nnature.  Professor Maxon wished to watch the building of the houses and\nthe stockade, that he might offer such suggestions as he thought\nnecessary, and again the girl noticed her father's comparative\nindifference to her welfare.\n\nShe had been shocked at his apathy at the time of the pirate attack,\nand chagrined that it should have been necessary for von Horn to have\ninsisted upon a proper guard being left with her thereafter.\n\nThe nearer the approach of the time when he might enter again upon\nthose experiments which had now been neglected for the better part of a\nyear the more self absorbed and moody became the professor.  At times\nhe was scarcely civil to those about him, and never now did he have a\npleasant word or a caress for the daughter who had been his whole life\nbut a few short months before.\n\nIt often seemed to Virginia when she caught her father's eyes upon her\nthat there was a gleam of dislike in them, as though he would have been\nglad to have been rid of her that she might not in any way embarrass or\ninterfere with his work.\n\nThe camp was at last completed, and on a Saturday afternoon all the\nheavier articles from the ship had been transported to it.  On the\nfollowing Monday the balance of the goods was to be sent on shore and\nthe party were to transfer their residence to their new quarters.\n\nLate Sunday afternoon a small native boat was seen rounding the point\nat the harbor's southern extremity, and after a few minutes it drew\nalongside the Ithaca.  There were but three men in it--two Dyaks and a\nMalay.  The latter was a tall, well built man of middle age, of a\nsullen and degraded countenance.  His garmenture was that of the\nordinary Malay boatman, but there was that in his mien and his attitude\ntoward his companions which belied his lowly habiliments.\n\nIn answer to von Horn's hail the man asked if he might come aboard and\ntrade; but once on the deck it developed that he had brought\nnothing wherewith to trade.  He seemed not the slightest disconcerted\nby this discovery, stating that he would bring such articles as they\nwished when he had learned what their requirements were.\n\nThe ubiquitous Sing was on hand during the interview, but from his\nexpressionless face none might guess what was passing through the\ntortuous channels of his Oriental mind.  The Malay had been aboard\nnearly half an hour talking with von Horn when the mate, Bududreen,\ncame on deck, and it was Sing alone who noted the quickly concealed\nflash of recognition which passed between the two Malays.\n\nThe Chinaman also saw the gleam that shot into the visitor's eye as\nVirginia emerged from the cabin, but by no word or voluntary outward\nsign did the man indicate that he had even noticed her.  Shortly\nafterward he left, promising to return with provisions the following\nday.  But it was to be months before they again saw him.\n\nThat evening as Sing was serving Virginia's supper he asked her if she\nhad recognized their visitor of the afternoon.\n\n\"Why no, Sing,\" she replied, \"I never saw him before.\"\n\n\"Sh!\" admonished the celestial.  \"No talkee so strong, wallee have ear\nall same labbit.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Sing?\" asked the girl in a low voice.  \"How\nperfectly weird and mysterious you are.  Why you make the cold chills\nrun up my spine,\" she ended, laughing.  But Sing did not return her\nsmile as was his custom.\n\n\"You no lememba tallee Lajah stand up wavee lite clothee in plilate\nboat, ah?\" he urged.\n\n\"Oh, Sing,\" she cried, \"I do indeed!  But unless you had reminded me I\nshould never have thought to connect him with our visitor of\ntoday--they do look very much alike, don't they?\"\n\n\"Lookeelike!  Ugh, they all samee one man.  Sing know.  You lookee out,\nLinee,\" which was the closest that Sing had ever been able to come to\npronouncing Virginia.\n\n\"Why should I look out?  He doesn't want me,\" said the girl, laughingly.\n\n\"Don't you bee too damee sure 'bout lat, Linee,\" was Sing's inelegant\nbut convincing reply, as he turned toward his galley.\n\nThe following morning the party, with the exception of three Malays who\nwere left to guard the Ithaca, set out for the new camp.  The journey\nwas up the bed of the small stream which emptied into the harbor, so\nthat although fifteen men had passed back and forth through the jungle\nfrom the beach to the camp every day for two weeks, there was no sign\nthat human foot had ever crossed the narrow strip of sand that lay\nbetween the dense foliage and the harbor.\n\nThe gravel bottom of the rivulet made fairly good walking, and as\nVirginia was borne in a litter between two powerful lascars it was not\neven necessary that she wet her feet in the ascent of the stream to the\ncamp.  The distance was short, the center of the camp being but a mile\nfrom the harbor, and less than half a mile from the opposite shore of\nthe island which was but two miles at its greatest breadth, and two and\na quarter at its greatest length.\n\nAt the camp Virginia found that a neat clearing had been made upon a\nlittle tableland, a palisade built about it, and divided into three\nparts; the most northerly of which contained a small house for herself\nand her father, another for von Horn, and a common cooking and eating\nhouse over which Sing was to preside.\n\nThe enclosure at the far end of the palisade was for the Malay and\nlascar crew and there also were quarters for Bududreen and the Malay\nsecond mate.  The center enclosure contained Professor Maxon's\nworkshop.  This compartment of the enclosure Virginia was not invited\nto inspect, but as members of the crew carried in the two great chests\nwhich the professor had left upon the Ithaca until the last moment,\nVirginia caught a glimpse of the two buildings that had been erected\nwithin this central space--a small, square house which was quite\nevidently her father's laboratory, and a long, low thatched shed\ndivided into several compartments, each containing a rude bunk.  She\nwondered for whom they could be intended.  Quarters for all the party\nhad already been arranged for elsewhere, nor, thought she, would her\nfather wish to house any in such close proximity to his workshop, where\nhe would desire absolute quiet and freedom from interruption.  The\ndiscovery perplexed her not a little, but so changed were her relations\nwith her father that she would not question him upon this or any other\nsubject.\n\nAs the two chests were being carried into the central campong, Sing,\nwho was standing near Virginia, called her attention to the fact that\nBududreen was one of those who staggered beneath the weight of the\nheavier burden.\n\n\"Bludleen, him mate.  Why workee alsame lascar boy?  Eh?\" But Virginia\ncould give no reason.\n\n\"I am afraid you don't like Bududreen, Sing,\" she said.  \"Has he ever\nharmed you in any way?\"\n\n\"Him?  No, him no hurt Sing.  Sing poor,\" with which more or less\nenigmatical rejoinder the Chinaman returned to his work.  But he\nmuttered much to himself the balance of the day, for Sing knew that a\nchest that strained four men in the carrying could contain but one\nthing, and he knew that Bududreen was as wise in such matters as he.\n\nFor a couple of months the life of the little hidden camp went on\npeacefully and without exciting incident.  The Malay and lascar crew\ndivided their time between watch duty on board the Ithaca, policing the\ncamp, and cultivating a little patch of clearing just south of their\nown campong.\n\nThere was a small bay on the island's east coast, only a quarter of a\nmile from camp, in which oysters were found, and one of the Ithaca's\nboats was brought around to this side of the island for fishing.\nBududreen often accompanied these expeditions, and on several occasions\nthe lynx-eyed Sing had seen him returning to camp long after the others\nhad retired for the night.\n\nProfessor Maxon scarcely ever left the central enclosure.  For days and\nnights at a time Virginia never saw him, his meals being passed in to\nhim by Sing through a small trap door that had been cut in the\npartition wall of the \"court of mystery\" as von Horn had christened the\nsection of the camp devoted to the professor's experimentations.\n\nVon Horn himself was often with his employer, as he enjoyed the latter's\ncomplete confidence, and owing to his early medical training was well\nfitted to act as a competent assistant; but he was often barred from\nthe workshop, and at such times was much with Virginia.\n\nThe two took long walks through the untouched jungle, exploring their\nlittle island, and never failing to find some new and wonderful proof\nof Nature's creative power among its flora and fauna.\n\n\"What a marvellous thing is creation,\" exclaimed Virginia as she and\nvon Horn paused one day to admire a tropical bird of unusually\nbrilliant plumage.  \"How insignificant is man's greatest achievement\nbeside the least of Nature's works.\"\n\n\"And yet,\" replied von Horn, \"man shall find Nature's secret some day.\nWhat a glorious accomplishment for him who first succeeds.  Can you\nimagine a more glorious consummation of a man's life work--your\nfather's, for example?\"\n\nThe girl looked at von Horn closely.\n\n\"Dr. von Horn,\" she said, \"pride has restrained me from asking what was\nevidently intended that I should not know.  For years my father has\nbeen interested in an endeavor to solve the mystery of life--that he\nwould ever attempt to utilize the secret should he have been so\nfortunate as to discover it had never occurred to me.  I mean that he\nshould try to usurp the functions of the Creator I could never have\nbelieved, but my knowledge of him, coupled with what you have said, and\nthe extreme lengths to which he has gone to maintain absolute secrecy\nfor his present experiments can only lead to one inference; and that,\nthat his present work, if successful, would have results that would not\nbe countenanced by civilized society or government.  Am I right?\"\n\nVon Horn had attempted to sound the girl that he might, if possible,\ndiscover her attitude toward the work in which her father and he were\nengaged.  He had succeeded beyond his hopes, for he had not intended\nthat she should guess so much of the truth as she had.  Should her\ninterest in the work have proved favorable it had been his intention to\nacquaint her fully with the marvellous success which already had\nattended their experiments, and to explain their hopes and plans for\nthe future, for he had seen how her father's attitude had hurt her and\nhoped to profit himself by reposing in her the trust and confidence\nthat her father denied her.\n\nAnd so it was that her direct question left him floundering in a sea of\nembarrassment, for to tell her the truth now would gain him no favor in\nher eyes, while it certainly would lay him open to the suspicion and\ndistrust of her father should he learn of it.\n\n\"I cannot answer your question, Miss Maxon,\" he said, finally, \"for\nyour father's strictest injunction has been that I divulge to no one\nthe slightest happening within the court of mystery.  Remember that I\nam in your father's employ, and that no matter what my personal\nconvictions may be regarding the work he has been doing I may only act\nwith loyalty to his lightest command while I remain upon his payroll.\nThat you are here,\" he added, \"is my excuse for continuing my\nconnection with certain things of which my conscience does not approve.\"\n\nThe girl glanced at him quickly.  She did not fully understand the\nmotive for his final avowal, and a sudden intuition kept her from\nquestioning him.  She had learned to look upon von Horn as a very\npleasant companion and a good friend--she was not quite certain that\nshe would care for any change in their relations, but his remark had\nsowed the seed of a new thought in her mind as he had intended that it\nshould.\n\nWhen von Horn returned to the court of mystery, he narrated to\nProfessor Maxon the gist of his conversation with Virginia, wishing to\nforestall anything which the girl might say to her father that would\ngive him an impression that von Horn had been talking more than he\nshould.  Professor Maxon listened to the narration in silence.  When\nvon Horn had finished, he cautioned him against divulging to Virginia\nanything that took place within the inner campong.\n\n\"She is only a child,\" he said, \"and would not understand the\nimportance of the work we are doing.  All that she would be able to see\nis the immediate moral effect of these experiments upon the subjects\nthemselves--she would not look into the future and appreciate the\nimmense advantage to mankind that must accrue from a successful\ntermination of our research.  The future of the world will be assured\nwhen once we have demonstrated the possibility of the chemical\nproduction of a perfect race.\"\n\n\"Number One, for example,\" suggested von Horn.\n\nProfessor Maxon glanced at him sharply.\n\n\"Levity, Doctor, is entirely out of place in the contemplation of the\nmagnificent work I have already accomplished,\" said the professor\ntartly.  \"I admit that Number One leaves much to be desired--much to be\ndesired; but Number Two shows a marked advance along certain lines, and\nI am sure that tomorrow will divulge in experiment Number Three such\nstrides as will forever silence any propensity toward scoffing which\nyou may now entertain.\"\n\n\"Forgive me, Professor,\" von Horn hastened to urge.  \"I did not intend\nto deride the wonderful discoveries which you have made, but it is only\nnatural that we should both realize that Number One is not beautiful.\nTo one another we may say what we would not think of suggesting to\noutsiders.\"\n\nProfessor Maxon was mollified by this apology, and turned to resume his\nwatch beside a large, coffin-shaped vat.  For a while von Horn was\nsilent.  There was that upon his mind which he had wished to discuss\nwith his employer since months ago, but the moment had never arrived\nwhich seemed at all propitious, nor did it appear likely ever to\narrive.  So the doctor decided to broach the subject now, as being\npsychologically as favorable a time as any.\n\n\"Your daughter is far from happy, Professor,\" he said, \"nor do I feel\nthat, surrounded as we are by semi-savage men, she is entirely safe.\"\n\nProfessor Maxon looked up from his vigil by the vat, eyeing von Horn\nclosely.\n\n\"Well?\" he asked.\n\n\"It seemed to me that had I a closer relationship I might better assist\nin adding to her happiness and safety--in short, Professor, I should\nlike your permission to ask Virginia to marry me.\"\n\nThere had been no indication in von Horn's attitude toward the girl\nthat he loved her.  That she was beautiful and intelligent could not be\ndenied, and so it was small wonder that she might appeal strongly to\nany man, but von Horn was quite evidently not of the marrying type.\nFor years he had roved the world in search of adventure and excitement.\nJust why he had left America and his high place in the navy he never\nhad divulged; nor why it was that for seven years he had not set his\nfoot upon ground which lay beneath the authority of Uncle Sam.\n\nSing Lee who stood just without the trap door through which he was\nabout to pass Professor Maxon's evening meal to him could not be blamed\nfor overhearing the conversation, though it may have been culpable in\nhim in making no effort to divulge his presence, and possibly equally\nunpraiseworthy, as well as lacking in romance, to attribute the\ndoctor's avowal to his knowledge of the heavy chest.\n\nAs Professor Maxon eyed the man before replying to his abrupt request,\nvon Horn noted a strange and sudden light in the older man's eyes--a\nsomething which he never before had seen there and which caused an\nuncomfortable sensation to creep over him--a manner of bristling that\nwas akin either to fear or horror, von Horn could not tell which.\n\nThen the professor arose from his seat and came very close to the\nyounger man, until his face was only a few inches from von Horn's.\n\n\"Doctor,\" he whispered in a strange, tense voice, \"you are mad.  You do\nnot know what you ask.  Virginia is not for such as you.  Tell me that\nshe does not know of your feelings toward her.  Tell me that she does\nnot reciprocate your love.  Tell me the truth, man.\" Professor Maxon\nseized von Horn roughly by both shoulders, his glittering eyes glaring\nterribly into the other's.\n\n\"I have never spoken to her of love, Professor,\" replied von Horn\nquietly, \"nor do I know what her sentiments toward me may be.  Nor do I\nunderstand, sir, what objections you may have to me--I am of a very old\nand noble family.\"  His tone was haughty but respectful.\n\nProfessor Maxon released his hold upon his assistant, breathing a sigh\nof relief.\n\n\"I am glad,\" he said, \"that it has gone no further, for it must not be.\nI have other, nobler aspirations for my daughter.  She must wed a\nperfect man--none such now exists.  It remains for me to bring forth\nthe ideal mate for her--nor is the time far distant.  A few more weeks\nand we shall see such a being as I have long dreamed.\" Again the queer\nlight flickered for a moment in the once kindly and jovial eyes of the\nscientist.\n\nVon Horn was horrified.  He was a man of little sentiment. He could in\ncold blood have married this girl for the wealth he knew that she would\ninherit; but the thought that she was to be united with such a\nTHING--\"Lord!  It is horrible,\" and his mind pictured the fearful\natrocity which was known as Number One.\n\nWithout a word he turned and left the campong.  A moment later Sing's\nknock aroused Professor Maxon from the reverie into which he had\nfallen, and he stepped to the trap door to receive his evening meal.\n\n\n\n3\n\nBEAUTY AND THE BEAST\n\n\nOne day, about two weeks later, von Horn and the professor were\noccupied closely with their work in the court of mystery.  Developments\nwere coming in riotous confusion.  A recent startling discovery bade\nfare to simplify and expedite the work far beyond the fondest dreams of\nthe scientist.\n\nVon Horn's interest in the marvellous results that had been obtained\nwas little short of the professor's--but he foresaw a very different\noutcome of it all, and by day never moved without a gun at either hip,\nand by night both of them were beside him.\n\nSing Lee, the noonday meal having been disposed of, set forth with rod,\nstring and bait to snare gulls upon the beach.  He moved quietly\nthrough the jungle, his sharp eyes and ears always alert for anything\nthat might savor of the unusual, and so it was that he saw the two men\nupon the beach, while they did not see him at all.\n\nThey were Bududreen and the same tall Malay whom Sing had seen twice\nbefore--once in splendid raiment and commanding the pirate prahu, and\nagain as a simple boatman come to the Ithaca to trade, but without the\ngoods to carry out his professed intentions.\n\nThe two squatted on the beach at the edge of the jungle a short\ndistance above the point at which Sing had been about to emerge when he\ndiscovered them, so that it was but the work of a moment or two for the\nChinaman to creep stealthily through the dense underbrush to a point\ndirectly above them and not three yards from where they conversed in\nlow tones--yet sufficiently loud that Sing missed not a word.\n\n\"I tell you, Bududreen, that it will be quite safe,\" the tall Malay was\nsaying.  \"You yourself tell me that none knows of the whereabouts of\nthese white men, and if they do not return your word will be accepted\nas to their fate.  Your reward will be great if you bring the girl to\nme, and if you doubt the loyalty of any of your own people a kris will\nsilence them as effectually as it will silence the white men.\"\n\n\"It is not fear of the white men, oh, Rajah Muda Saffir, that deters\nme,\" said Bududreen, \"but how shall I know that after I have come to\nyour country with the girl I shall not myself be set upon and silenced\nwith a golden kris--there be many that will be jealous of the great\nservice I have done for the mighty rajah.\"\n\nMuda Saffir knew perfectly well that Bududreen had but diplomatically\nexpressed a fear as to his own royal trustworthiness, but it did not\nanger him, since the charge was not a direct one; but what he did not\nknow was of the heavy chest and Bududreen's desire to win the price of\nthe girl and yet be able to save for himself a chance at the far\ngreater fortune which he knew lay beneath that heavy oaken lid.\n\nBoth men had arisen now and were walking across the beach toward a\nsmall, native canoe in which Muda Saffir had come to the meeting place.\nThey were out of earshot before either spoke again, so that what\nfurther passed between them Sing could not even guess, but he had heard\nenough to confirm the suspicions he had entertained for a long while.\n\nHe did not fish for gulls that day.  Bududreen and Muda Saffir stood\ntalking upon the beach, and the Chinaman did not dare venture forth for\nfear they might suspect that he had overheard them.  If old Sing Lee\nknew his Malays, he was also wise enough to give them credit for\nknowing their Chinamen, so he waited quietly in hiding until Muda\nSaffir had left, and Bududreen returned to camp.\n\n\nProfessor Maxon and von Horn were standing over one of the six vats\nthat were arranged in two rows down the center of the laboratory.  The\nprofessor had been more communicative and agreeable today than for some\ntime past, and their conversation had assumed more of the familiarity\nthat had marked it during the first month of their acquaintance at\nSingapore.\n\n\"And what of these first who are so imperfect?\" asked von Horn.  \"You\ncannot take them into civilization, nor would it be right to leave them\nhere upon this island.  What will you do with them?\"\n\nProfessor Maxon pondered the question for a moment.\n\n\"I have given the matter but little thought,\" he said at length.  \"They\nare but the accidents of my great work.  It is unfortunate that they\nare as they are, but without them I could have never reached the\nperfection that I am sure we are to find here,\" and he tapped lovingly\nupon the heavy glass cover of the vat before which he stood.  \"And this\nis but the beginning.  There can be no more mistakes now, though I\ndoubt if we can ever improve upon that which is so rapidly developing\nhere.\" Again he passed his long, slender hand caressingly over the\ncoffin-like vat at the head of which was a placard bearing the words,\nNUMBER THIRTEEN.\n\n\"But the others, Professor!\" insisted von Horn.  \"We must decide.\nAlready they have become a problem of no small dimensions.  Yesterday\nNumber Five desired some plantains that I had given to Number Seven.  I\ntried to reason with him, but, as you know, he is mentally defective,\nand for answer he rushed at Number Seven to tear the coveted morsel\nfrom him.  The result was a battle royal that might have put to shame\ntwo Bengal tigers.  Twelve is tractable and intelligent.  With his\nassistance and my bull whip I succeeded in separating them before\neither was killed.  Your greatest error was in striving at first for\nsuch physical perfection.  You have overdone it, with the result that\nthe court of mystery is peopled by a dozen brutes of awful muscularity,\nand scarcely enough brain among the dozen to equip three properly.\"\n\n\"They are as they are,\" replied the professor.  \"I shall do for them\nwhat I can--when I am gone they must look to themselves.  I can see no\nway out of it.\"\n\n\"What you have given you may take away,\" said von Horn, in a low tone.\n\nProfessor Maxon shuddered.  Those three horrid days in the workshop at\nIthaca flooded his memory with all the gruesome details he had tried\nfor so many months to forget.  The haunting ghosts of the mental\nanguish that had left him an altered man--so altered that there were\ntimes when he had feared for his sanity!\n\n\"No, no!\" he almost shouted.  \"It would be murder.  They are--\"\n\n\"They are THINGS,\" interrupted von Horn.  \"They are not human--they are\nnot even beast.  They are terrible, soulless creatures.  You have no\nright to permit them to live longer than to substantiate your theory.\nNone but us knows of their existence--no other need know of their\npassing.  It must be done.  They are a constant and growing menace to\nus all, but most of all to your daughter.\"\n\nA cunning look came into the professor's eyes.\n\n\"I understand,\" he said.  \"The precedent once established, all must\nperish by its edict--even those which may not be grotesque or\nbestial--even this perfect one,\" and he touched again the vat, \"and\nthus you would rid yourself of rival suitors.  But no!\" he went on in a\nhigh, trembling voice.  \"I shall not be led to thus compromise myself,\nand be thwarted in my cherished plan.  Be this one what he may he shall\nwed my daughter!\"\n\nThe man had raised himself upon his toes as he reached his climax--his\nclenched hand was high above his head--his voice fairly thundered out\nthe final sentence, and with the last word he brought his fist down\nupon the vat before him.  In his eyes blazed the light of unchained\nmadness.\n\nVon Horn was a brave man, but he shuddered at the maniacal ferocity of\nthe older man, and shrank back.  The futility of argument was apparent,\nand he turned and left the workshop.\n\nSing Lee was late that night.  In fact he did not return from his\nfruitless quest for gulls until well after dark, nor would he vouchsafe\nany explanation of the consequent lateness of supper.  Nor could he be\nfound shortly after the evening meal when Virginia sought him.\n\nNot until the camp was wrapped in the quiet of slumber did Sing Lee\nreturn--stealthy and mysterious--to creep under cover of a moonless\nnight to the door of the workshop.  How he gained entrance only Sing\nLee knows, but a moment later there was a muffled crash of broken glass\nwithin the laboratory, and the Chinaman had slipped out, relocked the\ndoor, and scurried to his nearby shack.  But there was no occasion for\nhis haste--no other ear than his had heard the sound within the\nworkshop.\n\nIt was almost nine the following morning before Professor Maxon and von\nHorn entered the laboratory.  Scarcely had the older man passed the\ndoorway than he drew up his hands in horrified consternation.  Vat\nNumber Thirteen lay dashed to the floor--the glass cover was broken to\na million pieces--a sticky, brownish substance covered the matting.\nProfessor Maxon hid his face in his hands.\n\n\"God!\" he cried.  \"It is all ruined.  Three more days would have--\"\n\n\"Look!\" cried von Horn.  \"It is not too soon.\"\n\nProfessor Maxon mustered courage to raise his eyes from his hands, and\nthere he beheld, seated in a far corner of the room a handsome giant,\nphysically perfect.  The creature looked about him in a dazed,\nuncomprehending manner.  A great question was writ large upon his\nintelligent countenance.  Professor Maxon stepped forward and took him\nby the hand.\n\n\"Come,\" he said, and led him toward a smaller room off the main\nworkshop.  The giant followed docilely, his eyes roving about the\nroom--the pitiful questioning still upon his handsome features.  Von\nHorn turned toward the campong.\n\nVirginia, deserted by all, even the faithful Sing, who, cheated of his\nsport on the preceding day, had again gone to the beach to snare gulls,\nbecame restless of the enforced idleness and solitude.  For a time she\nwandered about the little compound which had been reserved for the\nwhites, but tiring of this she decided to extend her stroll beyond the\npalisade, a thing which she had never before done unless accompanied by\nvon Horn--a thing both he and her father had cautioned her against.\n\n\"What danger can there be?\" she thought.  \"We know that the island is\nuninhabited by others than ourselves, and that there are no dangerous\nbeasts.  And, anyway, there is no one now who seems to care what\nbecomes of me, unless--unless--I wonder if he does care.  I wonder if I\ncare whether or not he cares.  Oh, dear, I wish I knew,\" and as she\nsoliloquized she wandered past the little clearing and into the jungle\nthat lay behind the campong.\n\n\nAs von Horn and Professor Maxon talked together in the laboratory\nbefore the upsetting of vat Number Thirteen, a grotesque and horrible\ncreature had slunk from the low shed at the opposite side of the\ncampong until it had crouched at the flimsy door of the building in\nwhich the two men conversed.  For a while it listened intently, but\nwhen von Horn urged the necessity for dispatching certain \"terrible,\nsoulless creatures\" an expression of intermingled fear and hatred\nconvulsed the hideous features, and like a great grizzly it turned and\nlumbered awkwardly across the campong toward the easterly, or back wall\nof the enclosure.\n\nHere it leaped futilely a half dozen times for the top of the palisade,\nand then trembling and chattering in rage it ran back and forth along\nthe base of the obstacle, just as a wild beast in captivity paces\nangrily before the bars of its cage.\n\nFinally it paused to look once more at the senseless wood that barred\nits escape, as though measuring the distance to the top.  Then the eyes\nroamed about the campong to rest at last upon the slanting roof of the\nthatched shed which was its shelter.  Presently a slow idea was born in\nthe poor, malformed brain.\n\nThe creature approached the shed.  He could just reach the saplings\nthat formed the frame work of the roof.  Like a huge sloth he drew\nhimself to the roof of the structure.  From here he could see beyond\nthe palisade, and the wild freedom of the jungle called to him.  He did\nnot know what it was but in its leafy wall he perceived many breaks and\nopenings that offered concealment from the creatures who were plotting\nto take his life.\n\nYet the wall was not fully six feet from him, and the top of it at\nleast five feet above the top of the shed--those who had designed the\ncampong had been careful to set this structure sufficiently far from\nthe palisade to prevent its forming too easy an avenue of escape.\n\nThe creature glanced fearfully toward the workshop.  He remembered the\ncruel bull whip that always followed each new experiment on his part\nthat did not coincide with the desires of his master, and as he thought\nof von Horn a nasty gleam shot his mismated eyes.\n\nHe tried to reach across the distance between the roof and the\npalisade, and in the attempt lost his balance and nearly precipitated\nhimself to the ground below.  Cautiously he drew back, still looking\nabout for some means to cross the chasm.  One of the saplings of the\nroof, protruding beyond the palm leaf thatch, caught his attention.\nWith a single wrench he tore it from its fastenings.  Extending it\ntoward the palisade he discovered that it just spanned the gap, but he\ndared not attempt to cross upon its single slender strand.\n\nQuickly he ripped off a half dozen other poles from the roof, and\nlaying them side by side, formed a safe and easy path to freedom.  A\nmoment more and he sat astride the top of the wall.  Drawing the poles\nafter him, he dropped them one by one to the ground outside the\ncampong.  Then he lowered himself to liberty.\n\nGathering the saplings under one huge arm he ran, lumberingly, into the\njungle.  He would not leave evidence of the havoc he had wrought; the\nfear of the bull whip was still strong upon him.  The green foliage\nclosed about him and the peaceful jungle gave no sign of the horrid\nbrute that roamed its shadowed mazes.\n\n\nAs von Horn stepped into the campong his quick eye perceived the havoc\nthat had been wrought with the roof at the east end of the shed.\nQuickly he crossed to the low structure.  Within its compartments a\nnumber of deformed monsters squatted upon their haunches, or lay prone\nupon the native mats that covered the floor.\n\nAs the man entered they looked furtively at the bull whip which trailed\nfrom his right hand, and then glanced fearfully at one another as\nthough questioning which was the malefactor on this occasion.\n\nVon Horn ran his eyes over the hideous assemblage.\n\n\"Where is Number One?\" he asked, directing his question toward a thing\nwhose forehead gave greater promise of intelligence than any of his\ncompanions.\n\nThe one addressed shook his head.\n\nVon Horn turned and made a circuit of the campong.  There was no sign\nof the missing one and no indication of any other irregularity than the\ndemolished portion of the roof.  With an expression of mild concern\nupon his face he entered the workshop.\n\n\"Number One has escaped into the jungle, Professor,\" he said.\n\nProfessor Maxon looked up in surprise, but before he had an opportunity\nto reply a woman's scream, shrill with horror, smote upon their\nstartled ears.\n\nVon Horn was the first to reach the campong of the whites.  Professor\nMaxon was close behind him, and the faces of both were white with\napprehension.  The enclosure was deserted.  Not even Sing was there.\nWithout a word the two men sprang through the gateway and raced for the\njungle in the direction from which that single, haunting cry had come.\n\nVirginia Maxon, idling beneath the leafy shade of the tropical foliage,\nbecame presently aware that she had wandered farther from the campong\nthan she had intended.  The day was sultry, and the heat, even in the\ndense shade of the jungle, oppressive.  Slowly she retraced her steps,\nher eyes upon the ground, her mind absorbed in sad consideration of her\nfather's increasing moodiness and eccentricity.\n\nPossibly it was this very abstraction which deadened her senses to the\nnear approach of another.  At any rate the girl's first intimation that\nshe was not alone came when she raised her eyes to look full into the\nhorrid countenance of a fearsome monster which blocked her path toward\ncamp.\n\nThe sudden shock brought a single involuntary scream from her lips.\nAnd who can wonder!  The thing thrust so unexpectedly before her eyes\nwas hideous in the extreme.  A great mountain of deformed flesh clothed\nin dirty, white cotton pajamas!  Its face was of the ashen hue of a\nfresh corpse, while the white hair and pink eyes denoted the absence of\npigment; a characteristic of albinos.\n\nOne eye was fully twice the diameter of the other, and an inch above\nthe horizontal plane of its tiny mate.  The nose was but a gaping\norifice above a deformed and twisted mouth.  The thing was chinless,\nand its small, foreheadless head surrounded its colossal body like a\ncannon ball on a hill top.  One arm was at least twelve inches longer\nthan its mate, which was itself long in proportion to the torso, while\nthe legs, similarly mismated and terminating in huge, flat feet that\nprotruded laterally, caused the thing to lurch fearfully from side to\nside as it lumbered toward the girl.\n\nA sudden grimace lighted the frightful face as the grotesque eyes fell\nupon this new creature.  Number One had never before seen a woman, but\nthe sight of this one awoke in the unplumbed depths of his soulless\nbreast a great desire to lay his hands upon her.  She was very\nbeautiful.  Number One wished to have her for his very own; nor would\nit be a difficult matter, so fragile was she, to gather her up in those\ngreat, brute arms and carry her deep into the jungle far out of hearing\nof the bull-whip man and the cold, frowning one who was continually\nmeasuring and weighing Number One and his companions, the while he\nscrutinized them with those strange, glittering eyes that frightened\none even more than the cruel lash of the bull whip.\n\nNumber One lurched forward, his arms outstretched toward the horror\nstricken girl.  Virginia tried to cry out again--she tried to turn and\nrun; but the horror of her impending fate and the terror that those\nawful features induced left her paralyzed and helpless.\n\nThe thing was almost upon her now.  The mouth was wide in a hideous\nattempt to smile.  The great hands would grasp her in another\nsecond--and then there was a sudden crashing of the underbrush behind\nher, a yellow, wrinkled face and a flying pig-tail shot past her, and\nthe brave old Sing Lee grappled with the mighty monster that threatened\nher.\n\nThe battle was short--short and terrible.  The valiant Chinaman sought\nthe ashen throat of his antagonist, but his wiry, sinewy muscles were\nas reeds beneath the force of that inhuman power that opposed them.\nHolding the girl at arm's length in one hand, Number One tore the\nbattling Chinaman from him with the other, and lifting him bodily above\nhis head, hurled him stunned and bleeding against the bole of a giant\nbuttress tree.  Then lifting Virginia in his arms once more he dived\ninto the impenetrable mazes of the jungle that lined the more open\npathway between the beach and camp.\n\n\n\n4\n\nA NEW FACE\n\n\nAs Professor Maxon and von Horn rushed from the workshop to their own\ncampong, they neglected, in their haste, to lock the door between, and\nfor the first time since the camp was completed it stood unlatched and\najar.\n\nThe professor had been engaged in taking careful measurements of the\nhead of his latest experiment, the while he coached the young man in\nthe first rudiments of spoken language, and now the subject of his\nlabors found himself suddenly deserted and alone.  He had not yet been\nwithout the four walls of the workshop, as the professor had wished to\nkeep him from association with the grotesque results of his earlier\nexperiments, and now a natural curiosity tempted him to approach the\ndoor through which his creator and the man with the bull whip had so\nsuddenly disappeared.\n\nHe saw before him a great walled enclosure roofed by a lofty azure\ndome, and beyond the walls the tops of green trees swaying gently in\nthe soft breezes.  His nostrils tasted the incense of fresh earth and\ngrowing things.  For the first time he felt the breath of Nature, free\nand unconfined, upon his brow.\n\nHe drew his giant frame to its full height and drank in the freedom and\nthe sweetness of it all, filling his great lungs to their fullest; and\nwith the first taste he learned to hate the close and stuffy confines\nof his prison.\n\nHis virgin mind was filled with wonder at the wealth of new impressions\nwhich surged to his brain through every sense.  He longed for more, and\nthe open gateway of the campong was a scarce needed invitation to pass\nto the wide world beyond.  With the free and easy tread of utter\nunconsciousness of self, he passed across the enclosure and stepped out\ninto the clearing which lay between the palisade and the jungle.\n\nAh, here was a still more beautiful world!  The green leaves nodded to\nhim, and at their invitation he came and the jungle reached out its\nmillion arms to embrace him.  Now before him, behind, on either side\nthere was naught but glorious green beauty shot with splashes of\ngorgeous color that made him gasp in wonderment.\n\nBrilliant birds rose from amidst it all, skimming hither and thither\nabove his head--he thought that the flowers and the birds were the\nsame, and when he reached out and plucked a blossom, tenderly, he\nwondered that it did not flutter in his hand.  On and on he walked, but\nslowly, for he must not miss a single sight in the strange and\nwonderful place; and then, of a sudden, the quiet beauty of the scene\nwas harshly broken by the crashing of a monster through the underbrush.\n\nNumber Thirteen was standing in a little open place in the jungle when\nthe discordant note first fell upon his ears, and as he turned his head\nin the direction of the sound he was startled at the hideous aspect of\nthe thing which broke through the foliage before him.\n\nWhat a horrid creature!  But on the same instant his eyes fell upon\nanother borne in the arms of the terrible one.  This one was\ndifferent--very different,--soft and beautiful and white.  He wondered\nwhat it all meant, for everything was strange and new to him; but when\nhe saw the eyes of the lovely one upon him, and her arms outstretched\ntoward him, though he did not understand the words upon her lips, he\nknew that she was in distress.  Something told him that it was the ugly\nthing that carried her that was the author of her suffering.\n\nVirginia Maxon had been half unconscious from fright when she suddenly\nsaw a white man, clothed in coarse, white, native pajamas, confronting\nher and the misshapen beast that was bearing her away to what frightful\nfate she could but conjecture.\n\nAt the sight of the man her voice returned with returning hope, and she\nreached her arms toward him, calling upon him to save her.  Although he\ndid not respond she thought that he understood for he sprang toward\nthem before her appeal was scarce uttered.\n\nAs before, when Sing had threatened to filch his new possession from\nhim, Number One held the girl with one hand while he met the attack of\nthis new assailant with the other; but here was very different metal\nthan had succumbed to him before.\n\nIt is true that Number Thirteen knew nothing whatever of personal\ncombat, but Number One had but little advantage of him in the matter of\nexperience, while the former was equipped with great natural\nintelligence as well as steel muscles no whit less powerful than his\ndeformed predecessor.\n\nSo it was that the awful giant found his single hand helpless to cope\nwith the strength of his foeman, and in a brief instant felt powerful\nfingers clutching at his throat.  Still reluctant to surrender his hold\nupon his prize, he beat futilely at the face of his enemy, but at last\nthe agony of choking compelled him to drop the girl and grapple madly\nwith the man who choked him with one hand and rained mighty and\nmerciless blows upon his face and head with the other.\n\nHis captive sank to the ground, too weak from the effects of nervous\nshock to escape, and with horror-filled eyes watched the two who\nbattled over her.  She saw that her would-be rescuer was young and\nstrong featured--all together a very fine specimen of manhood; and to\nher great wonderment it was soon apparent that he was no unequal match\nfor the great mountain of muscle that he fought.\n\nBoth tore and struck and clawed and bit in the frenzy of mad, untutored\nstrife, rolling about on the soft carpet of the jungle almost\nnoiselessly except for their heavy breathing and an occasional\nbeast-like snarl from Number One.  For several minutes they fought thus\nuntil the younger man succeeded in getting both hands upon the throat\nof his adversary, and then, choking relentlessly, he raised the brute\nwith him from the ground and rushed him fiercely backward against the\nstem of a tree.  Again and again he hurled the monstrous thing upon the\nunyielding wood, until at last it hung helpless and inert in his\nclutches, then he cast it from him, and without another glance at it\nturned toward the girl.\n\nHere was a problem indeed.  Now that he had won her, what was he to do\nwith her?  He was but an adult child, with the brain and brawn of a\nman, and the ignorance and inexperience of the new-born.  And so he\nacted as a child acts, in imitation of what it has seen others do.  The\nbrute had been carrying the lovely creature, therefore that must be the\nthing for him to do, and so he stooped and gathered Virginia Maxon in\nhis great arms.\n\nShe tried to tell him that she could walk after a moment's rest, but it\nwas soon evident that he did not understand her, as a puzzled\nexpression came to his face and he did not put her down as she asked.\nInstead he stood irresolute for a time, and then moved slowly through\nthe jungle.  By chance his direction was toward the camp, and this fact\nso relieved the girl's mind that presently she was far from loath to\nremain quietly in his arms.\n\nAfter a moment she gained courage to look up into his face.  She\nthought that she never had seen so marvellously clean cut features, or\na more high and noble countenance, and she wondered how it was that\nthis white man was upon the island and she not have known it.  Possibly\nhe was a new arrival--his presence unguessed even by her father.  That\nhe was neither English nor American was evident from the fact that he\ncould not understand her native tongue.  Who could he be! What was he\ndoing upon their island!\n\nAs she watched his face he suddenly turned his eyes down upon her, and\nas she looked hurriedly away she was furious with herself as she felt a\ncrimson flush mantle her cheek.  The man only half sensed, in a vague\nsort of way, the meaning of the tell tale color and the quickly averted\neyes; but he became suddenly aware of the pressure of her delicate body\nagainst his, as he had not been before.  Now he kept his eyes upon her\nface as he walked, and a new emotion filled his breast.  He did not\nunderstand it, but it was very pleasant, and he knew that it was\nbecause of the radiant thing that he carried in his arms.\n\nThe scream that had startled von Horn and Professor Maxon led them\nalong the trail toward the east coast of the island, and about halfway\nof the distance they stumbled upon the dazed and bloody Sing just as he\nwas on the point of regaining consciousness.\n\n\"For God's sake, Sing, what is the matter?\" cried von Horn.  \"Where is\nMiss Maxon?\"\n\n\"Big blute, he catchem Linee.  Tly kill Sing.  Head hit tlee.  No see\nany more.  Wakee up--all glone,\" moaned the Chinaman as he tried to\ngain his feet.\n\n\"Which way did he take her?\" urged von Horn.\n\nSing's quick eyes scanned the surrounding jungle, and in a moment,\nstaggering to his feet, he cried, \"Look see, klick!  Foot plint!\" and\nran, weak and reeling drunkenly, along the broad trail made by the\ngiant creature and its prey.\n\nVon Horn and Professor Maxon followed closely in Sing's wake, the\nyounger man horrified by the terrible possibilities that obtruded\nthemselves into his imagination despite his every effort to assure\nhimself that no harm could come to Virginia Maxon before they reached\nher.  The girl's father had not spoken since they discovered that she\nwas missing from the campong, but his face was white and drawn; his\neyes wide and glassy as those of one whose mind is on the verge of\nmadness from a great nervous shock.\n\nThe trail of the creature was bewilderingly erratic.  A dozen paces\nstraight through the underbrush, then a sharp turn at right angles for\nno apparent reason, only to veer again suddenly in a new direction!\nThus, turning and twisting, the tortuous way led them toward the south\nend of the island, until Sing, who was in advance, gave a sharp cry of\nsurprise.\n\n\"Klick!  Look see!\" he cried excitedly.  \"Blig blute dead--vely muchee\ndead.\"\n\nVon Horn rushed forward to where the Chinaman was leaning over the body\nof Number One.  Sure enough, the great brute lay motionless, its horrid\nface even more hideous in death than in life, if it were possible.  The\nface was black, the tongue protruded, the skin was bruised from the\nheavy fists of his assailant and the thick skull crushed and splintered\nfrom terrific impact with the tree.\n\nProfessor Maxon leaned over von Horn's shoulder.  \"Ah, poor Number\nOne,\" he sighed, \"that you should have come to such an untimely end--my\nchild, my child.\"\n\nVon Horn looked at him, a tinge of compassion in his rather hard face.\nIt touched the man that his employer was at last shocked from the\nobsession of his work to a realization of the love and duty he owed his\ndaughter; he thought that the professor's last words referred to\nVirginia.\n\n\"Though there are twelve more,\" continued Professor Maxon, \"you were my\nfirst born son and I loved you most, dear child.\"\n\nThe younger man was horrified.\n\n\"My God, Professor!\" he cried.  \"Are you mad?  Can you call this thing\n'child' and mourn over it when you do not yet know the fate of your own\ndaughter?\"\n\nProfessor Maxon looked up sadly.  \"You do not understand, Dr. von\nHorn,\" he replied coldly, \"and you will oblige me, in the future, by\nnot again referring to the offspring of my labors as 'things.'\"\n\nWith an ugly look upon his face von Horn turned his back upon the older\nman--what little feeling of loyalty and affection he had ever felt for\nhim gone forever.  Sing was looking about for evidences of the cause of\nNumber One's death and the probable direction in which Virginia Maxon\nhad disappeared.\n\n\"What on earth could have killed this enormous brute, Sing?  Have you\nany idea?\" asked von Horn.\n\nThe Chinaman shook his head.\n\n\"No savvy,\" he replied.  \"Blig flight.  Look see,\" and he pointed to\nthe torn and trampled turf, the broken bushes, and to one or two small\ntrees that had been snapped off by the impact of the two mighty bodies\nthat had struggled back and forth about the little clearing.\n\n\"This way,\" cried Sing presently, and started off once more into the\nbrush, but this time in a northwesterly direction, toward camp.\n\nIn silence the three men followed the new trail, all puzzled beyond\nmeasure to account for the death of Number One at the hands of what\nmust have been a creature of superhuman strength.  What could it have\nbeen!  It was impossible that any of the Malays or lascars could have\ndone the thing, and there were no other creatures, brute or human, upon\nthe island large enough to have coped even for an instant with the\nferocious brutality of the dead monster, except--von Horn's brain came\nto a sudden halt at the thought.  Could it be?  There seemed no other\nexplanation.  Virginia Maxon had been rescued from one soulless\nmonstrosity to fall into the hands of another equally irresponsible and\nterrifying.\n\nOthers then must have escaped from the campong.  Von Horn loosened his\nguns in their holsters, and took a fresh grip upon his bull whip as he\nurged Sing forward upon the trail.  He wondered which one it was, but\nnot once did it occur to him that the latest result of Professor\nMaxon's experiments could be the rescuer of Virginia Maxon.  In his\nmind he could see only the repulsive features of one of the others.\n\nQuite unexpectedly they came upon the two, and with a shout von Horn\nleaped forward, his bull whip upraised.  Number Thirteen turned in\nsurprise at the cry, and sensing a new danger for her who lay in his\narms, he set her gently upon the ground behind him and advanced to meet\nhis assailant.\n\n\"Out of the way, you--monstrosity,\" cried von Horn.  \"If you have\nharmed Miss Maxon I'll put a bullet in your heart!\"\n\nNumber Thirteen did not understand the words that the other addressed\nto him but he interpreted the man's actions as menacing, not to\nhimself, but to the creature he now considered his particular charge;\nand so he met the advancing man, more to keep him from the girl than to\noffer him bodily injury for he recognized him as one of the two who had\ngreeted his first dawning consciousness.\n\nVon Horn, possibly intentionally, misinterpreted the other's motive,\nand raising his bull whip struck Number Thirteen a vicious cut across\nthe face, at the same time levelling his revolver point blank at the\nbroad breast.  But before ever he could pull the trigger an avalanche of\nmuscle was upon him, and he went down to the rotting vegetation of the\njungle with five sinewy fingers at his throat.\n\nHis revolver exploded harmlessly in the air, and then another hand\nwrenched it from him and hurled it far into the underbrush.  Number\nThirteen knew nothing of the danger of firearms, but the noise had\nstartled him and his experience with the stinging cut of the bull whip\nconvinced him that this other was some sort of instrument of torture of\nwhich it would be as well to deprive his antagonist.\n\nVirginia Maxon looked on in horror as she realized that her rescuer was\nquickly choking Dr. von Horn to death.  With a little cry she sprang to\nher feet and ran toward them, just as her father emerged from the\nunderbrush through which he had been struggling in the trail of the\nagile Chinaman and von Horn.  Placing her hand upon the great wrist of\nthe giant she tried to drag his fingers from von Horn's throat,\npleading meanwhile with both voice and eyes for the life of the man she\nthought loved her.\n\nAgain Number Thirteen translated the intent without understanding the\nwords, and releasing von Horn permitted him to rise.  With a bound he\nwas upon his feet and at the same instant brought his other gun from\nhis side and levelled it upon the man who had released him; but as his\nfinger tightened upon the trigger Virginia Maxon sprang between them\nand grasping von Horn's wrist deflected the muzzle of the gun just as\nthe cartridge exploded.  Simultaneously Professor Maxon sprang from his\ngrasp and hurled him back with the superhuman strength of a maniac.\n\n\"Fool!\" he cried.  \"What would you do?  Kill--,\" and then of a sudden\nhe realized his daughter's presence and the necessity for keeping the\norigin of the young giant from her knowledge.\n\n\"I am surprised at you, Dr. von Horn,\" he continued in a more level\nvoice.  \"You must indeed have forgotten yourself to thus attack a\nstranger upon our island until you know whether he be friend or foe.\nCome!  Escort my daughter to the camp, while I make the proper\napologies to this gentleman.\"  As he saw that both Virginia and von\nHorn hesitated, he repeated his command in a peremptory tone, adding;\n\"Quick, now; do as I bid you.\"\n\nThe moment had given von Horn an opportunity to regain his\nself-control, and realizing as well as did his employer, but from\nanother motive, the necessity of keeping the truth from the girl, he\ntook her arm and led her gently from the scene.  At Professor Maxon's\ndirection Sing accompanied them.\n\nNow in Number Thirteen's brief career he had known no other authority\nthan Professor Maxon's, and so it was that when his master laid a hand\nupon his wrist he remained beside him while another walked away with\nthe lovely creature he had thought his very own.\n\nUntil after dark the professor kept the young man hidden in the jungle,\nand then, safe from detection, led him back to the laboratory.\n\n\n\n5\n\nTREASON\n\n\nOn their return to camp after her rescue Virginia talked a great deal\nto von Horn about the young giant who had rescued her, until the man\nfeared that she was more interested in him than seemed good for his own\nplans.\n\nHe had now cast from him the last vestige of his loyalty for his\nemployer, and thus freed had determined to use every means within his\npower to win Professor Maxon's daughter, and with her the heritage of\nwealth which he knew would be hers should her father, through some\nunforeseen mishap, meet death before he could return to civilization\nand alter his will, a contingency which von Horn knew he might have to\nconsider should he marry the girl against her father's wishes, and thus\nthwart the crazed man's mad, but no less dear project.\n\nHe realized that first he must let the girl fully understand the grave\nperil in which she stood, and turn her hope of protection from her\nfather to himself.  He imagined that the initial step in undermining\nVirginia's confidence in her father would be to narrate every detail of\nthe weird experiments which Professor Maxon had brought to such\nsuccessful issues during their residence upon the island.\n\nThe girl's own questioning gave him the lead he needed.\n\n\"Where could that horrid creature have come from that set upon me in\nthe jungle and nearly killed poor Sing?\" she asked.\n\nFor a moment von Horn was silent, in well simulated hesitancy to reply\nto her query.\n\n\"I cannot tell you, Miss Maxon,\" he said sadly, \"how much I should hate\nto be the one to ignore your father's commands, and enlighten you upon\nthis and other subjects which lie nearer to your personal welfare than\nyou can possibly guess; but I feel that after the horrors of this day\nduty demands that I must lay all before you--you cannot again be\nexposed to the horrors from which you were rescued only by a miracle.\"\n\n\"I cannot imagine what you hint at, Dr. von Horn,\" said Virginia, \"but\nif to explain to me will necessitate betraying my father's confidence I\nprefer that you remain silent.\"\n\n\"You do not understand,\" broke in the man, \"you cannot guess the\nhorrors that I have seen upon this island, or the worse horrors that\nare to come.  Could you dream of what lies in store for you, you would\nseek death rather than face the future.  I have been loyal to your\nfather, Virginia, but were you not blind, or indifferent, you would\nlong since have seen that your welfare means more to me than my loyalty\nto him--more to me than my life or my honor.\n\n\"You asked where the creature came from that attacked you today.  I\nshall tell you.  It is one of a dozen similarly hideous things that\nyour father has created in his mad desire to solve the problem of life.\nHe has solved it; but, God, at what a price in misshapen, soulless,\nhideous monsters!\"\n\nThe girl looked up at him, horror stricken.\n\n\"Do you mean to say that my father in a mad attempt to usurp the\nfunctions of God created that awful thing?\" she asked in a low, faint\nvoice, \"and that there are others like it upon the island?\"\n\n\"In the campong next to yours there are a dozen others,\" replied von\nHorn, \"nor would it be easy to say which is the most hideous and\nrepulsive.  They are grotesque caricatures of humanity--without soul\nand almost without brain.\"\n\n\"God!\" murmured the girl, burying her face in her hands, \"he has gone\nmad; he has gone mad.\"\n\n\"I truly believe that he is mad,\" said von Horn, \"nor could you doubt\nit for a moment were I to tell you the worst.\"\n\n\"The worst!\" exclaimed the girl.  \"What could be worse than that which\nyou already have divulged?  Oh, how could you have permitted it?\"\n\n\"There is much worse than I have told you, Virginia.  So much worse\nthat I can scarce force my lips to frame the words, but you must be\ntold.  I would be more criminally liable than your father were I to\nkeep it from you, for my brain, at least, is not crazed.  Virginia, you\nhave in your mind a picture of the hideous thing that carried you off\ninto the jungle?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" and as the girl replied a convulsive shudder racked her frame.\n\nVon Horn grasped her arm gently as he went on, as though to support and\nprotect her during the shock that he was about to administer.\n\n\"Virginia,\" he said in a very low voice, \"it is your father's intention\nto wed you to one of his creatures.\"\n\nThe girl broke from him with an angry cry.\n\n\"It is not true!\" she exclaimed.  \"It is not true.  Oh, Dr. von Horn\nhow could you tell me such a cruel and terrible untruth.\"\n\n\"As God is my judge, Virginia,\" and the man reverently uncovered as he\nspoke, \"it is the truth.  Your father told me it in so many words when\nI asked his permission to pay court to you myself--you are to marry\nNumber Thirteen when his education is complete.\"\n\n\"I shall die first!\" she cried.\n\n\"Why not accept me instead?\" suggested the man.\n\nFor a moment Virginia looked straight into his eyes as though to read\nhis inmost soul.\n\n\"Let me have time to consider it, Doctor,\" she replied.  \"I do not know\nthat I care for you in that way at all.\"\n\n\"Think of Number Thirteen,\" he suggested.  \"It should not be difficult\nto decide.\"\n\n\"I could not marry you simply to escape a worse fate,\" replied the\ngirl.  \"I am not that cowardly--but let me think it over.  There can be\nno immediate danger, I am sure.\"\n\n\"One can never tell,\" replied von Horn, \"what strange, new vagaries may\nenter a crazed mind to dictate this moment's action or the next.\"\n\n\"Where could we wed?\" asked Virginia.\n\n\"The Ithaca would bear us to Singapore, and when we returned you would\nbe under my legal protection and safe.\"\n\n\"I shall think about it from every angle,\" she answered sadly, \"and now\ngood night, my dear friend,\" and with a wan smile she entered her\nquarters.\n\nFor the next month Professor Maxon was busy educating Number Thirteen.\nHe found the young man intelligent far beyond his most sanguine hopes,\nso that the progress made was little short of uncanny.\n\nVon Horn during this time continued to urge upon Virginia the necessity\nfor a prompt and favorable decision in the matter of his proposal; but\nwhen it came time to face the issue squarely the girl found it\nimpossible to accede to his request--she thought that she loved him,\nbut somehow she dared not say the word that would make her his for life.\n\nBududreen, the Malay mate was equally harassed by conflicting desires,\nthough of a different nature, for he had his eye upon the main chance\nthat was represented to him by the great chest, and also upon the\nlesser reward which awaited him upon delivery of the girl to Rajah Muda\nSaffir.  The fact that he could find no safe means for accomplishing\nboth these ends simultaneously was all that had protected either from\nhis machinations.\n\nThe presence of the uncanny creatures of the court of mystery had\nbecome known to the Malay and he used this knowledge as an argument to\nfoment discord and mutiny in the ignorant and superstitious crew under\nhis command.  By boring a hole in the partition wall separating their\ncampong from the inner one he had disclosed to the horrified view of\nhis men the fearsome brutes harbored so close to them.  The mate, of\ncourse, had no suspicion of the true origin of these monsters, but his\nknowledge of the fact that they had not been upon the island when the\nIthaca arrived and that it would have been impossible for them to have\nlanded and reached the camp without having been seen by himself or some\nmember of his company, was sufficient evidence to warrant him in\nattributing their presence to some supernatural and malignant power.\n\nThis explanation the crew embraced willingly, and with it Bududreen's\nsuggestion that Professor Maxon had power to transform them all into\nsimilar atrocities.  The ball once started gained size and momentum as\nit progressed.  The professor's ofttimes strange expression was\nattributed to an evil eye, and every ailment suffered by any member of\nthe crew was blamed upon their employer's Satanic influence.  There was\nbut one escape from the horrors of such a curse--the death of its\nauthor; and when Bududreen discovered that they had reached this point,\nand were even discussing the method of procedure, he added all that was\nneeded to the dangerously smouldering embers of bloody mutiny by\nexplaining that should anything happen to the white men he would become\nsole owner of their belongings, including the heavy chest, and that the\nreward of each member of the crew would be generous.\n\nVon Horn was really the only stumbling block in Bududreen's path.  With\nthe natural cowardice of the Malay he feared this masterful American\nwho never moved without a brace of guns slung about his hips; and it\nwas at just this psychological moment that the doctor played into the\nhands of his subordinate, much to the latter's inward elation.\n\nVon Horn had finally despaired of winning Virginia by peaceful court,\nand had about decided to resort to force when he was precipitately\nconfirmed in his decision by a conversation with the girl's father.\n\nHe and the professor were talking in the workshop of the remarkable\nprogress of Number Thirteen toward a complete mastery of English and\nthe ways and manners of society, in which von Horn had been assisting\nhis employer to train the young giant.  The breach between the latter\nand von Horn had been patched over by Professor Maxon's explanations to\nNumber Thirteen as soon as the young man was able to comprehend--in the\nmeantime it had been necessary to keep von Horn out of the workshop\nexcept when the giant was confined in his own room off the larger one.\n\nVon Horn had been particularly anxious, for the furtherance of certain\nplans he had in mind, to effect a reconciliation with Number Thirteen,\nto reach a basis of friendship with the young man, and had left no\nstone unturned to accomplish this result.  To this end he had spent\nconsiderable time with Number Thirteen, coaching him in English and in\nthe ethics of human association.\n\n\"He is progressing splendidly, Doctor,\" Professor Maxon had said.  \"It\nwill be but a matter of a day or so when I can introduce him to\nVirginia, but we must be careful that she has no inkling of his origin\nuntil mutual affection has gained a sure foothold between them.\"\n\n\"And if that should not occur?\" questioned von Horn.\n\n\"I should prefer that they mated voluntarily,\" replied the professor,\nthe strange gleam leaping to his eyes at the suggestion of possible\nantagonism to his cherished plan, \"but if not, then they shall be\ncompelled by the force of my authority--they both belong to me, body\nand soul.\"\n\n\"You will wait for the final consummation of your desires until you\nreturn with them to civilization, I presume,\" said von Horn.\n\n\"And why?\" returned the professor.  \"I can wed them here myself--it\nwould be the surer way--yes, that is what I shall do.\"\n\nIt was this determination on the part of Professor Maxon that decided\nvon Horn to act at once.  Further, it lent a reasonable justification\nfor his purposed act.\n\nShortly after their talk the older man left the workshop, and von Horn\ntook the opportunity to inaugurate the second move of his campaign.\nNumber Thirteen was sitting near a window which let upon the inner\ncourt, busy with the rudiments of written English.  Von Horn approached\nhim.\n\n\"You are getting along nicely, Jack,\" he said kindly, looking over the\nother's shoulder and using the name which had been adopted at his\nsuggestion to lend a more human tone to their relations with the\nnameless man.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the other, looking up with a smile.  \"Professor Maxon\nsays that in another day or two I may come and live in his own house,\nand again meet his beautiful daughter.  It seems almost too good to be\ntrue that I shall actually live under the same roof with her and see\nher every day--sit at the same table with her--and walk with her among\nthe beautiful trees and flowers that witnessed our first meeting.  I\nwonder if she will remember me.  I wonder if she will be as glad to see\nme again as I shall be to see her.\"\n\n\"Jack,\" said von Horn, sadly, \"I am afraid there is a terrible and\ndisappointing awakening for you.  It grieves me that it should be so,\nbut it seems only fair to tell you, what Professor Maxon either does\nnot know or has forgotten, that his daughter will not look with\npleasure upon you when she learns your origin.\n\n\"You are not as other men.  You are but the accident of a laboratory\nexperiment.  You have no soul, and the soul is all that raises man\nabove the beasts.  Jack, poor boy, you are not a human being--you are\nnot even a beast.  The world, and Miss Maxon is of the world, will look\nupon you as a terrible creature to be shunned--a horrible monstrosity\nfar lower in the scale of creation than the lowest order of brutes.\n\n\"Look,\" and the man pointed through the window toward the group of\nhideous things that wandered aimlessly about the court of mystery.\n\"You are of the same breed as those, you differ from them only in the\nsymmetry of your face and features, and the superior development of\nyour brain.  There is no place in the world for them, nor for you.\n\n\"I am sorry that it is so.  I am sorry that I should have to be the one\nto tell you; but it is better that you know it now from a friend than\nthat you meet the bitter truth when you least expected it, and possibly\nfrom the lips of one like Miss Maxon for whom you might have formed a\nhopeless affection.\"\n\nAs von Horn spoke the expression on the young man's face became more\nand more hopeless, and when he had ceased he dropped his head into his\nopen palms, sitting quiet and motionless as a carven statue.  No sob\nshook his great frame, there was no outward indication of the terrible\ngrief that racked him inwardly--only in the pose was utter dejection\nand hopelessness.\n\nThe older man could not repress a cold smile--it had had more effect\nthan he had hoped.\n\n\"Don't take it too hard, my boy,\" he continued.  \"The world is wide.\nIt would be easy to find a thousand places where your antecedents would\nbe neither known nor questioned.  You might be very happy elsewhere and\nthere are a hundred thousand girls as beautiful and sweet as Virginia\nMaxon--remember that you have never seen another, so you can scarcely\njudge.\"\n\n\"Why did he ever bring me into the world?\" exclaimed the young man\nsuddenly.  \"It was wicked--wicked--terribly cruel and wicked.\"\n\n\"I agree with you,\" said von Horn quickly, seeing another possibility\nthat would make his future plans immeasurably easier.  \"It was wicked,\nand it is still more wicked to continue the work and bring still other\nunfortunate creatures into the world to be the butt and plaything of\ncruel fate.\"\n\n\"He intends to do that?\" asked the youth.\n\n\"Unless he is stopped,\" replied von Horn.\n\n\"He must be stopped,\" cried the other.  \"Even if it were necessary to\nkill him.\"\n\nVon Horn was quite satisfied with the turn events had taken.  He\nshrugged his shoulders and turned on his heel toward the outer campong.\n\n\"If he had wronged me as he has you, and those others,\" with a gesture\ntoward the court of mystery, \"I should not be long in reaching a\ndecision.\"  And with that he passed out, leaving the door unlatched.\n\nVon Horn went straight to the south campong and sought out Bududreen.\nMotioning the Malay to follow him they walked across the clearing and\nentered the jungle out of sight and hearing of the camp.  Sing, hanging\nclothes in the north end of the clearing saw them depart, and wondered\na little.\n\n\"Bududreen,\" said von Horn, when the two had reached a safe distance\nfrom the enclosures, \"there is no need of mincing matters--something\nmust be done at once.  I do not know how much you know of the work that\nProfessor Maxon has been engaged in since we reached this island; but\nit has been hellish enough and it must go no further.  You have seen\nthe creatures in the campong next to yours?\"\n\n\"I have seen,\" replied Bududreen, with a shudder.\n\n\"Professor Maxon intends to wed one of these to his daughter,\" von Horn\ncontinued.  \"She loves me and we wish to escape--can I rely on you and\nyour men to aid us?  There is a chest in the workshop which we must\ntake along too, and I can assure you that you all will be well rewarded\nfor your work.  We intend merely to leave Professor Maxon here with the\ncreatures he has created.\"\n\nBududreen could scarce repress a smile--it was indeed too splendid to\nbe true.\n\n\"It will be perilous work, Captain,\" he answered.  \"We should all be\nhanged were we caught.\"\n\n\"There will be no danger of that, Bududreen, for there will be no one\nto divulge our secret.\"\n\n\"There will be the Professor Maxon,\" urged the Malay.  \"Some day he\nwill escape from the island, and then we shall all hang.\"\n\n\"He will never escape,\" replied von Horn, \"his own creatures will see\nto that.  They are already commencing to realize the horrible crime he\nhas committed against them, and when once they are fully aroused there\nwill be no safety for any of us.  If you wish to leave the island at\nall it will be best for you to accept my proposal and leave while your\nhead yet remains upon your shoulders.  Were we to suggest to the\nprofessor that he leave now he would not only refuse but he would take\nsteps to make it impossible for any of us to leave, even to sinking the\nIthaca.  The man is mad--quite mad--Bududreen, and we cannot longer\njeopardize our own throats merely to humor his crazy and criminal\nwhims.\"\n\nThe Malay was thinking fast, and could von Horn have guessed what\nthoughts raced through the tortuous channels of that semi-barbarous\nbrain he would have wished himself safely housed in the American prison\nwhere he belonged.\n\n\"When do you wish to sail?\" asked the Malay.\n\n\"Tonight,\" replied von Horn, and together they matured their plans.  An\nhour later the second mate with six men disappeared into the jungle\ntoward the harbor.  They, with the three on watch, were to get the\nvessel in readiness for immediate departure.\n\nAfter the evening meal von Horn sat on the verandah with Virginia Maxon\nuntil the Professor came from the workshop to retire for the night.  As\nhe passed them he stopped for a word with von Horn, taking him aside\nout of the girl's hearing.\n\n\"Have you noticed anything peculiar in the actions of Thirteen?\" asked\nthe older man.  \"He was sullen and morose this evening, and at times\nthere was a strange, wild light in his eyes as he looked at me.  Can it\nbe possible that, after all, his brain is defective?  It would be\nterrible.  My work would have gone for naught, for I can see no way in\nwhich I can improve upon him.\"\n\n\"I will go and have a talk with him later,\" said von Horn, \"so if you\nhear us moving about in the workshop, or even out here in the campong\nthink nothing of it.  I may take him for a long walk.  It is possible\nthat the hard study and close confinement to that little building have\nbeen too severe upon his brain and nerves.  A long walk each evening\nmay bring him around all right.\"\n\n\"Splendid--splendid,\" replied the professor.  \"You may be quite right.\nDo it by all means, my dear doctor,\" and there was a touch of the old,\nfriendly, sane tone which had been so long missing, that almost caused\nvon Horn to feel a trace of compunction for the hideous act of\ndisloyalty that he was on the verge of perpetrating.\n\nAs Professor Maxon entered the house von Horn returned to Virginia and\nsuggested that they take a short walk outside the campong before\nretiring.  The girl readily acquiesced to the plan, and a moment later\nfound them strolling through the clearing toward the southern end of\nthe camp.  In the dark shadows of the gateway leading to the men's\nenclosure a figure crouched.  The girl did not see it, but as they came\nopposite it von Horn coughed twice, and then the two passed on toward\nthe edge of the jungle.\n\n\n\n6\n\nTO KILL!\n\n\nThe Rajah Muda Saffir, tiring of the excuses and delays which Bududreen\ninterposed to postpone the fulfillment of his agreement with the\nformer, whereby he was to deliver into the hands of the rajah a certain\nbeautiful maiden, decided at last to act upon his own initiative.  The\ntruth of the matter was that he had come to suspect the motives of the\nfirst mate of the Ithaca, and not knowing of the great chest attributed\nthem to Bududreen's desire to possess the girl for himself.\n\nSo it was that as the second mate of the Ithaca with his six men waded\ndown the bed of the little stream toward the harbor and the ship, a\nfleet of ten war prahus manned by over five hundred fierce Dyaks and\ncommanded by Muda Saffir himself, pulled cautiously into the little\ncove upon the opposite side of the island, and landed but a quarter of\na mile from camp.\n\nAt the same moment von Horn was leading Virginia Maxon farther and\nfarther from the north campong where resistance, if there was to be\nany, would be most likely to occur.  At his superior's cough Bududreen\nhad signalled silently to the men within the enclosure, and a moment\nlater six savage lascars crept stealthily to his side.\n\nThe moment that von Horn and the girl were entirely concealed by the\ndarkness, the seven moved cautiously along the shadow of the palisade\ntoward the north campong.  There was murder in the cowardly hearts of\nseveral of them, and stupidity and lust in the hearts of all.  There\nwas no single one who would not betray his best friend for a handful of\nsilver, nor any but was inwardly hoping and scheming to the end that he\nmight alone possess both the chest and the girl.\n\nIt was such a pack of scoundrels that Bududreen led toward the north\ncampong to bear away the treasure.  In the breast of the leader was the\nhope that he had planted enough of superstitious terror in their hearts\nto make the sight of the supposed author of their imagined wrongs\nsufficient provocation for his murder; for Bududreen was too sly to\ngive the order for the killing of a white man--the arm of the white\nman's law was too long--but he felt that he would rest easier were he\nto leave the island with the knowledge that only a dead man remained\nbehind with the secret of his perfidy.\n\nWhile these events were transpiring Number Thirteen was pacing\nrestlessly back and forth the length of the workshop.  But a short time\nbefore he had had his author--the author of his misery--within the four\nwalls of his prison, and yet he had not wreaked the vengeance that was\nin his heart.  Twice he had been on the point of springing upon the\nman, but both times the other's eyes had met his and something which he\nwas not able to comprehend had stayed him.  Now that the other had gone\nand he was alone contemplation of the hideous wrong that had been done\nloosed again the flood gates of his pent rage.\n\nThe thought that he had been made by this man--made in the semblance of\na human being, yet denied by the manner of his creation a place among\nthe lowest of Nature's creatures--filled him with fury, but it was not\nthis thought that drove him to the verge of madness.  It was the\nknowledge, suggested by von Horn, that Virginia Maxon would look upon\nhim in horror, as a grotesque and loathsome monstrosity.\n\nHe had no standard and no experience whereby he might classify his\nsentiments toward this wonderful creature.  All he knew was that his\nlife would be complete could he be near her always--see her and speak\nwith her daily.  He had thought of her almost constantly since those\nshort, delicious moments that he had held her in his arms.  Again and\nagain he experienced in retrospection the exquisite thrill that had run\nthrough every fiber of his being at the sight of her averted eyes and\nflushed face.  And the more he let his mind dwell upon the wonderful\nhappiness that was denied him because of his origin, the greater became\nhis wrath against his creator.\n\nIt was now quite dark without.  The door leading to Professor Maxon's\ncampong, left unlatched earlier in the evening by von Horn for sinister\nmotives of his own, was still unbarred through a fatal coincidence of\nforgetfulness on the part of the professor.\n\nNumber Thirteen approached this door.  He laid his hand upon the knob.\nA moment later he was moving noiselessly across the campong toward the\nhouse in which Professor Maxon lay peacefully sleeping; while at the\nsouth gate Bududreen and his six cutthroats crept cautiously within and\nslunk in the dense shadows of the palisade toward the workshop where\nlay the heavy chest of their desire.  At the same instant Muda Saffir\nwith fifty of his head-hunting Dyaks emerged from the jungle east of\nthe camp, bent on discovering the whereabouts of the girl the Malay\nsought and bearing her away to his savage court far within the jungle\nfastness of his Bornean principality.\n\nNumber Thirteen reached the verandah of the house and peered through\nthe window into the living room, where an oil lamp, turned low, dimly\nlighted the interior, which he saw was unoccupied.  Going to the door\nhe pushed it open and entered the apartment.  All was still within.  He\nlistened intently for some slight sound which might lead him to the\nvictim he sought, or warn him from the apartment of the girl or that of\nvon Horn--his business was with Professor Maxon.  He did not wish to\ndisturb the others whom he believed to be sleeping somewhere within the\nstructure--a low, rambling bungalow of eight rooms.\n\nCautiously he approached one of the four doors which opened from the\nliving room.  Gently he turned the knob and pushed the door ajar.  The\ninterior of the apartment beyond was in inky darkness, but Number\nThirteen's greatest fear was that he might have stumbled upon the\nsleeping room of Virginia Maxon, and that if she were to discover him\nthere, not only would she be frightened, but her cries would alarm the\nother inmates of the dwelling.\n\nThe thought of the horror that his presence would arouse within her,\nthe knowledge that she would look upon him as a terrifying monstrosity,\nadded new fuel to the fires of hate that raged in his bosom against the\nman who had created him.  With clenched fists, and tight set jaws the\ngreat, soulless giant moved across the dark chamber with the stealthy\nnoiselessness of a tiger.  Feeling before him with hands and feet he\nmade the circuit of the room before he reached the bed.\n\nScarce breathing he leaned over and groped across the covers with his\nfingers in search of his prey--the bed was empty.  With the discovery\ncame a sudden nervous reaction that sent him into a cold sweat.\nWeakly, he seated himself upon the edge of the bed.  Had his fingers\nfound the throat of Professor Maxon beneath the coverlet they would\nnever have released their hold until life had forever left the body of\nthe scientist, but now that the highest tide of the young man's hatred\nhad come and gone he found himself for the first time assailed by\ndoubts.\n\nSuddenly he recalled the fact that the man whose life he sought was the\nfather of the beautiful creature he adored.  Perhaps she loved him and\nwould be unhappy were he taken away from her.  Number Thirteen did not\nknow, of course, but the idea obtruded itself, and had sufficient\nweight to cause him to remain seated upon the edge of the bed\nmeditating upon the act he contemplated.  He had by no means given up\nthe idea of killing Professor Maxon, but now there were doubts and\nobstacles which had not been manifest before.\n\nHis standards of right and wrong were but half formed, from the brief\nattempts of Professor Maxon and von Horn to inculcate proper moral\nperceptions in a mind entirely devoid of hereditary inclinations toward\neither good or bad, but he realized one thing most perfectly--that to\nbe a soulless thing was to be damned in the estimation of Virginia\nMaxon, and it now occurred to him that to kill her father would be the\nact of a soulless being.  It was this thought more than another that\ncaused him to pause in the pursuit of his revenge, since he knew that\nthe act he contemplated would brand him the very thing he was, yet\nwished not to be.\n\nAt length, however, he slowly comprehended that no act of his would\nchange the hideous fact of his origin; that nothing would make him\nacceptable in her eyes, and with a shake of his head he arose and\nstepped toward the living room to continue his search for the professor.\n\nIn the workshop Bududreen and his men had easily located the chest.\nDragging it into the north campong the Malay was about to congratulate\nhimself upon the ease with which the theft had been accomplished when\none of his fellows declared his intention of going to the house for the\npurpose of dispatching Professor Maxon, lest the influence of his evil\neye should overtake them with some terrible curse when the loss of the\nchest should be discovered.\n\nWhile this met fully with Bududreen's plans he urged the man against\nany such act that he might have witnesses to prove that he not only had\nno hand in the crime, but had exerted his authority to prevent it; but\nwhen two of the men separated themselves from the party and crept\ntoward the bungalow no force was interposed to stop them.\n\nThe moon had risen now, so that from the dark shadows of the palisade\nMuda Saffir and his savages watched the party with Bududreen squatting\nabout the heavy chest, and saw the two who crept toward the house.  To\nMuda Saffir's evil mind there was but one explanation.  Bududreen had\ndiscovered a rich treasure, and having stolen that had dispatched two\nof his men to bring him the girl also.\n\nRajah Muda Saffir was furious.  In subdued whispers he sent a half\ndozen of his Dyaks back beneath the shadow of the palisade to the\nopposite side of the bungalow where they were to enter the building,\nkilling all within except the girl, whom they were to carry straight to\nthe beach and the war prahus.\n\nThen with the balance of his horde he crept alone in the darkness until\nopposite Bududreen and the watchers about the chest.  Just as the two\nwho crept toward the bungalow reached it, Muda Saffir gave the word for\nthe attack upon the Malays and lascars who guarded the treasure.  With\nsavage yells they dashed upon the unsuspecting men.  Parangs and spears\nglistened in the moonlight.  There was a brief and bloody encounter,\nfor the cowardly Bududreen and his equally cowardly crew had had no\nalternative but to fight, so suddenly had the foe fallen upon them.\n\nIn a moment the savage Borneo head hunters had added five grisly\ntrophies to their record.  Bududreen and another were racing madly\ntoward the jungle beyond the campong.\n\nAs Number Thirteen arose to continue his search for Professor Maxon his\nquick ear caught the shuffling of bare feet upon the verandah.  As he\npaused to listen there broke suddenly upon the still night the hideous\nwar cries of the Dyaks, and the screams and shrieks of their frightened\nvictims in the campong without.  Almost simultaneously Professor Maxon\nand Sing rushed into the living room to ascertain the cause of the wild\nalarm, while at the same instant Bududreen's assassins sprang through\nthe door with upraised krisses, to be almost immediately followed by\nMuda Saffir's six Dyaks brandishing their long spears and wicked\nparangs.\n\nIn an instant the little room was filled with howling, fighting men.\nThe Dyaks, whose orders as well as inclinations incited them to a\ngeneral massacre, fell first upon Bududreen's lascars who, cornered in\nthe small room, fought like demons for their lives, so that when the\nDyaks had overcome them two of their own number lay dead beside the\ndead bodies of Bududreen's henchmen.\n\nSing and Professor Maxon stood in the doorway to the professor's room\ngazing upon the scene of carnage in surprise and consternation.  The\nscientist was unarmed, but Sing held a long, wicked looking Colt in\nreadiness for any contingency.  It was evident the celestial was no\nstranger to the use of his deadly weapon, nor to the moments of extreme\nand sudden peril which demanded its use, for he seemed no more\nperturbed than had he been but hanging out his weekly wash.\n\nAs Number Thirteen watched the two men from the dark shadows of the\nroom in which he stood, he saw that both were calm--the Chinaman with\nthe calmness of perfect courage, the other through lack of full\nunderstanding of the grave danger which menaced him.  In the eyes of\nthe latter shone a strange gleam--it was the wild light of insanity\nthat the sudden nervous shock of the attack had brought to a premature\nculmination.\n\nNow the four remaining Dyaks were advancing upon the two men.  Sing\nlevelled his revolver and fired at the foremost, and at the same\ninstant Professor Maxon, with a shrill, maniacal scream, launched\nhimself full upon a second.  Number Thirteen saw the blood spurt from a\nsuperficial wound in the shoulder of the fellow who received Sing's\nbullet, but except for eliciting a howl of rage the missile had no\nimmediate effect.  Then Sing pulled the trigger again and again, but\nthe cylinder would not revolve and the hammer fell futilely upon the\nempty cartridge.  As two of the head hunters closed upon him the brave\nChinaman clubbed his weapon and went down beneath them beating madly at\nthe brown skulls.\n\nThe man with whom Professor Maxon had grappled had no opportunity to\nuse his weapons for the crazed man held him close with one encircling\narm while he tore and struck at him with his free hand.  The fourth\nDyak danced around the two with raised parang watching for an opening\nthat he might deliver a silencing blow upon the white man's skull.\n\nThe great odds against the two men--their bravery in the face of death,\ntheir grave danger--and last and greatest, the fact that one was the\nfather of the beautiful creature he worshipped, wrought a sudden change\nin Number Thirteen.  In an instant he forgot that he had come here to\nkill the white-haired man, and with a bound stood in the center of the\nroom--an unarmed giant towering above the battling four.\n\nThe parang of the Dyak who sought Professor Maxon's life was already\nfalling as a mighty hand grasped the wrist of the head hunter; but even\nthen it was too late to more than lessen the weight of the blow, and\nthe sharp edge of the blade bit deep into the forehead of the white\nman.  As he sank to his knees his other antagonist freed an arm from\nthe embrace which had pinioned it to his side, but before he could deal\nthe professor a blow with the short knife that up to now he had been\nunable to use, Number Thirteen had hurled his man across the room and\nwas upon him who menaced the scientist.\n\nTearing him loose from his prey, he raised him far above his head and\nthrew him heavily against the opposite wall, then he turned his\nattention toward Sing's assailants.  All that had so far saved the\nChinaman from death was the fact that the two savages were each so\nanxious to secure his head for the verandah rafters of his own\nparticular long-house that they interfered with one another in the\nconsummation of their common desire.\n\nAlthough battling for his life, Sing had not failed to note the advent\nof the strange young giant, nor the part he had played in succoring the\nprofessor, so that it was with a feeling of relief that he saw the\nnewcomer turn his attention toward those who were rapidly reducing the\ncitadel of his own existence.\n\nThe two Dyaks who sought the trophy which nature had set upon the\nChinaman's shoulders were so busily engaged with their victim that they\nknew nothing of the presence of Number Thirteen until a mighty hand\nseized each by the neck and they were raised bodily from the floor,\nshaken viciously for an instant, and then hurled to the opposite end of\nthe room upon the bodies of the two who had preceded them.\n\nAs Sing came to his feet he found Professor Maxon lying in a pool of\nhis own blood, a great gash in his forehead.  He saw the white giant\nstanding silently looking down upon the old man.  Across the room the\nfour stunned Dyaks were recovering consciousness.  Slowly and fearfully\nthey regained their feet, and seeing that no attention was being paid\nthem, cast a parting, terrified look at the mighty creature who had\ndefeated them with his bare hands, and slunk quickly out into the\ndarkness of the campong.\n\nWhen they caught up with Rajah Muda Saffir near the beach, they\nnarrated a fearful tale of fifty terrible white men with whom they had\nbattled valiantly, killing many, before they had been compelled to\nretreat in the face of terrific odds.  They swore that even then they\nhad only returned because the girl was not in the house--otherwise they\nshould have brought her to their beloved master as he had directed.\n\nNow Muda Saffir believed nothing that they said, but he was well\npleased with the great treasure which had so unexpectedly fallen into\nhis hands, and he decided to make quite sure of that by transporting it\nto his own land--later he could return for the girl.  So the ten war\nprahus of the Malay pulled quietly out of the little cove upon the east\nside of the island, and bending their way toward the south circled its\nsouthern extremity and bore away for Borneo.\n\nIn the bungalow within the north campong Sing and Number Thirteen had\nlifted Professor Maxon to his bed, and the Chinaman was engaged in\nbathing and bandaging the wound that had left the older man\nunconscious.  The white giant stood beside him watching his every move.\nHe was trying to understand why sometimes men killed one another and\nagain defended and nursed.  He was curious as to the cause of his own\nsudden change in sentiment toward Professor Maxon.  At last he gave the\nproblem up as beyond his powers of solution, and at Sing's command set\nabout the task of helping to nurse the man whom he considered the\nauthor of his unhappiness and whom a few short minutes before he had\ncome to kill.\n\nAs the two worked over the stricken man their ears were suddenly\nassailed by a wild commotion from the direction of the workshop.  There\nwere sounds of battering upon wood, loud growls and roars, mingled with\nweird shrieks and screams and the strange, uncanny gibbering of\nbrainless things.\n\nSing looked quickly up at his companion.\n\n\"Whallee mallee?\" he asked.\n\nThe giant did not answer.  An expression of pain crossed his features,\nand he shuddered--but not from fear.\n\n\n\n7\n\nTHE BULL WHIP\n\n\nAs von Horn and Virginia Maxon walked slowly beneath the dense shadows\nof the jungle he again renewed his suit.  It would please him more to\nhave the girl accompany him voluntarily than to be compelled to take\nher by force, but take her he would one way or another, and that, this\nvery night, for all the plans were made and already under way.\n\n\"I cannot do it, Doctor von Horn,\" she had said.  \"No matter how much\ndanger I may be in here I cannot desert my father on this lonely isle\nwith only savage lascars and the terrible monsters of his own creation\nsurrounding him.  Why, it would be little short of murder for us to do\nsuch a thing.  I cannot see how you, his most trusted lieutenant, can\neven give an instant's consideration to the idea.\n\n\"And now that you insist that his mind is sorely affected, it is only\nan added reason why I must remain with him to protect him so far as I\nam able, from himself and his enemies.\"\n\nVon Horn did not relish the insinuation in the accent which the girl\nput upon the last word.\n\n\"It is because I love you so, Virginia,\" he hastened to urge in\nextenuation of his suggested disloyalty.  \"I cannot see you sacrificed\nto his horrible mania.  You do not realize the imminence of your peril.\nTomorrow Number Thirteen was to have come to live beneath the same roof\nwith you.  You recall Number One whom the stranger killed as the thing\nwas bearing you away through the jungle?  Can you imagine sleeping in\nthe same house with such a soulless thing?  Eating your three meals a\nday at the same table with it?  And knowing all the time that in a few\nshort weeks at the most you were destined to be given to the thing as\nits mate?  Virginia, you must be mad to consider for a moment remaining\nwithin reach of such a terrible peril.\n\n\"Come to Singapore with me--it will take but a few days--and then we\ncan return with some good medical man and a couple of Europeans, and\ntake your father away from the terrible creatures he has created.  You\nwill be mine then and safe from the awful fate that now lies back there\nin the camp awaiting you.  We can take your father upon a long trip\nwhere rest and quiet can have an opportunity to restore his enfeebled\nmentality.  Come, Virginia!  Come with me now.  We can go directly to\nthe Ithaca and safety.  Say that you will come.\"\n\nThe girl shook her head.\n\n\"I do not love you, I am afraid, Doctor von Horn, or I should certainly\nbe moved by your appeal.  If you wish to bring help for my father I\nshall never cease to thank you if you will go to Singapore and fetch\nit, but it is not necessary that I go.  My place is here, near him.\"\n\nIn the darkness the girl did not see the change that came over the\nman's face, but his next words revealed his altered attitude with\nsufficient exactitude to thoroughly arouse her fears.\n\n\"Virginia,\" he said, \"I love you, and I intend to have you.  Nothing on\nearth can prevent me.  When you know me better you will return my love,\nbut now I must risk offending you that I may save you for myself from\nthe monstrous connection which your father contemplates for you.  If\nyou will not come away from the island with me voluntarily I consider\nit my duty to take you away by force.\"\n\n\"You would never do that, Doctor von Horn!\" she exclaimed.\n\nVon Horn had gone too far.  He cursed himself inwardly for a fool.  Why\nthe devil didn't that villain, Bududreen, come!  He should have been\nalong to act his part half an hour before.\n\n\"No, Virginia,\" said the man, softly, after a moment's silence, \"I\ncould not do that; though my judgment tells me that I should do it.\nYou shall remain here if you insist and I will be with you to serve and\nprotect both you and your father.\"\n\nThe words were fair, but the girl could not forget the ugly tone that\nhad tinged his preceding statement.  She felt that she would be glad\nwhen she found herself safely within the bungalow once more.\n\n\"Come,\" she said, \"it is late.  Let us return to camp.\"\n\nVon Horn was about to reply when the war cries of Muda Saffir's Dyaks\nas they rushed out upon Bududreen and his companions came to them\ndistinctly through the tropic night.\n\n\"What was that?\" cried the girl in an alarmed tone.\n\n\"God knows,\" replied von Horn.  \"Can it be that our men have mutinied?\"\n\nHe thought the six with Bududreen were carrying out their part in a\nmost realistic manner, and a grim smile tinged his hard face.\n\nVirginia Maxon turned resolutely toward the camp.\n\n\"I must go back there to my father,\" she said, \"and so must you.  Our\nplace is there--God give that we be not too late,\" and before von Horn\ncould stop her she turned and ran through the darkness of the jungle in\nthe direction of the camp.\n\nVon Horn dashed after her, but so black was the night beneath the\noverhanging trees, festooned with their dark myriad creepers, that the\ngirl was out of sight in an instant, and upon the soft carpet of the\nrotting vegetation her light footfalls gave no sound.\n\nThe doctor made straight for the camp, but Virginia, unused to jungle\ntrailing even by day, veered sharply to the left.  The sounds which had\nguided her at first soon died out, the brush became thicker, and\npresently she realized that she had no conception of the direction of\nthe camp.  Coming to a spot where the trees were less dense, and a\nlittle moonlight filtered to the ground, she paused to rest and attempt\nto regain her bearings.\n\nAs she stood listening for some sound which might indicate the\nwhereabouts of the camp, she detected the noise of a body approaching\nthrough the underbrush.  Whether man or beast she could but conjecture\nand so she stood with every nerve taut waiting the thing that\nfloundered heavily toward her.  She hoped it might be von Horn, but the\nhideous war cries which had apprised her of enemies at the encampment\nmade her fear that fate might be directing the footsteps of one of\nthese upon her.\n\nNearer and nearer came the sound, and the girl stood poised ready to\nfly when the dark face of Bududreen suddenly emerged into the moonlight\nbeside her.  With an hysterical cry of relief the girl greeted him.\n\n\"Oh, Bududreen,\" she exclaimed, \"what has happened at camp?  Where is\nmy father?  Is he safe?  Tell me.\"\n\nThe Malay could scarce believe the good fortune which had befallen him\nso quickly following the sore affliction of losing the treasure.  His\nevil mind worked quickly, so that he grasped the full possibilities\nthat were his before the girl had finished her questioning.\n\n\"The camp was attacked by Dyaks, Miss Maxon,\" he replied.  \"Many of our\nmen were killed, but your father escaped and has gone to the ship.  I\nhave been searching for you and Doctor von Horn.  Where is he?\"\n\n\"He was with me but a moment ago.  When we heard the cries at camp I\nhastened on to discover what calamity had befallen us--we became\nseparated.\"\n\n\"He will be safe,\" said Bududreen, \"for two of my men are waiting to\nguide you and the doctor to the ship in case you returned to camp\nbefore I found you.  Come, we will hasten on to the harbor.  Your\nfather will be worried if we are long delayed, and he is anxious to\nmake sail and escape before the Dyaks discover the location of the\nIthaca.\"\n\nThe man's story seemed plausible enough to Virginia, although she could\nnot repress a little pang of regret that her father had been willing to\ngo on to the harbor before he knew her fate.  However, she explained\nthat by her belief that his mind was unbalanced through constant\napplication to his weird obsession.\n\nWithout demur, then, she turned and accompanied the rascally Malay\ntoward the harbor.  At the bank of the little stream which led down to\nthe Ithaca's berth the man lifted her to his shoulder and thus bore her\nthe balance of the way to the beach.  Here two of his men were awaiting\nhim in one of the ship's boats, and without words they embarked and\npulled for the vessel.\n\nOnce on board Virginia started immediately for her father's cabin.  As\nshe crossed the deck she noticed that the ship was ready to sail, and\neven as she descended the companionway she heard the rattle of the\nanchor chain about the capstan.  She wondered if von Horn could be on\nboard too.  It seemed remarkable that all should have reached the\nIthaca so quickly, and equally strange that none of her own people were\non deck to welcome her, or to command the vessel.\n\nTo her chagrin she found her father's cabin empty, and a moment's\nhurried investigation disclosed the fact that von Horn's was unoccupied\nas well.  Now her doubts turned quickly to fears, and with a little\ngasp of dismay at the grim possibilities which surged through her\nimagination she ran quickly to the companionway, but above her she saw\nthat the hatch was down, and when she reached the top that it was\nfastened.  Futilely she beat upon the heavy planks with her delicate\nhands, calling aloud to Bududreen to release her, but there was no\nreply, and with the realization of the hopelessness of her position she\ndropped back to the deck, and returned to her stateroom.  Here she\nlocked and barricaded the door as best she could, and throwing herself\nupon the berth awaited in dry-eyed terror the next blow that fate held\nin store for her.\n\nShortly after von Horn became separated from Virginia he collided with\nthe fleeing lascar who had escaped the parangs of Muda Saffir's head\nhunters at the same time as had Bududreen.  So terror stricken was the\nfellow that he had thrown away his weapons in the panic of flight,\nwhich was all that saved von Horn from death at the hands of the fear\ncrazed man.  To him, in the extremity of his fright, every man was an\nenemy, and the doctor had a tough scuffle with him before he could\nimpress upon the fellow that he was a friend.\n\nFrom him von Horn obtained an incoherent account of the attack,\ntogether with the statement that he was the only person in camp that\nescaped, all the others having been cut down by the savage horde that\noverwhelmed them.  It was with difficulty that von Horn persuaded the\nman to return with him to the campong, but finally, he consented to do\nso when the doctor with drawn revolver, presented death as the only\nalternative.\n\nTogether they cautiously crept back toward the palisade, not knowing at\nwhat moment they might come upon the savage enemy that had wrought such\nhavoc among their forces, for von Horn believed the lascar's story that\nall had perished.  His only motive for returning lay in his desire to\nprevent Virginia Maxon falling into the hands of the Dyaks, or, failing\nthat, rescuing her from their clutches.\n\nWhatever faults and vices were Carl von Horn's cowardice was not one of\nthem, and it was without an instant's hesitation that he had elected to\nreturn to succor the girl he believed to have returned to camp,\nalthough he entertained no scruples regarding the further pursuit of\nhis dishonorable intentions toward her, should he succeed in saving her\nfrom her other enemies.\n\nAs the two approached the campong quiet seemed to have again fallen\nabout the scene of the recent alarm.  Muda Saffir had passed on toward\nthe cove with the heavy chest, and the scrimmage in the bungalow was\nover.  But von Horn did not abate his watchfulness as he stole silently\nwithin the precincts of the north campong, and, hugging the denser\nshadows of the palisade, crept toward the house.\n\nThe dim light in the living room drew him to one of the windows which\noverlooked the verandah.  A glance within showed him Sing and Number\nThirteen bending over the body of Professor Maxon.  He noted the\nhandsome face and perfect figure of the young giant.  He saw the bodies\nof the dead lascars and Dyaks.  Then he saw Sing and the young man lift\nProfessor Maxon tenderly in their arms and bear him to his own room.\n\nA sudden wave of jealous rage swept through the man's vicious brain.\nHe saw that the soulless thing within was endowed with a kindlier and\nmore noble nature than he himself possessed.  He had planted the seed\nof hatred and revenge within his untutored heart without avail, for he\nread in the dead bodies of Bududreen's men and the two Dyaks the story\nof Number Thirteen's defense of the man von Horn had hoped he would\nkill.\n\nVon Horn was quite sure now that Virginia Maxon was not within the\ncampong.  Either she had become confused and lost in the jungle after\nshe left him, or had fallen into the hands of the wild horde that had\nattacked the camp.  Convinced of this, there was no obstacle to thwart\nthe sudden plan which entered his malign brain.  With a single act he\ncould rid himself of the man whom he had come to look upon as a rival,\nwhose physical beauty aroused his envy and jealousy; he could remove,\nin the person of Professor Maxon, the parental obstacle which might\neither prevent his obtaining the girl, or make serious trouble for him\nin case he took her by force, and at the same time he could transfer to\nthe girl's possession the fortune which was now her father's--and he\ncould accomplish it all without tainting his own hands with the blood\nof his victims.\n\nAs the full possibilities of his devilish scheme unfolded before his\nmind's eye a grim smile curled his straight, thin lips at the thought\nof the fate which it entailed for the creator of the hideous monsters\nof the court of mystery.\n\nAs he turned away from the bungalow his eye fell upon the trembling\nlascar who had accompanied him to the edge of the verandah.  He must be\nrid of the fellow in some way--no eye must see him perpetrate the deed\nhe had in mind.  A solution quickly occurred to him.\n\n\"Hasten to the harbor,\" he said to the man in a low voice, \"and tell\nthose on board the ship that I shall join them presently.  Have all in\nreadiness to sail.  I wish to fetch some of my belongings--all within\nthe bungalow are dead.\"\n\nNo command could have better suited the sailor.  Without a word he\nturned and fled toward the jungle.  Von Horn walked quickly to the\nworkshop.  The door hung open.  Through the dark interior he strode\nstraight to the opposite door which let upon the court of mystery.  On\na nail driven into the door frame hung a heavy bull whip.  The doctor\ntook it down as he raised the strong bar which held the door.  Then he\nstepped through into the moonlit inner campong--the bull whip in his\nright hand, a revolver in his left.\n\nA half dozen misshapen monsters roved restlessly about the hard packed\nearth of the pen.  The noise of the battle in the adjoining enclosure\nhad aroused them from slumber and awakened in their half formed brains\nvague questionings and fears.  At sight of von Horn several of them\nrushed for him with menacing growls, but a swift crack of the bull whip\nbrought them to a sudden realization of the identity of the intruder,\nso that they slunk away, muttering and whining in rage.\n\nVon Horn passed quickly to the low shed in which the remainder of the\neleven were sleeping.  With vicious cuts from the stinging lash he lay\nabout him upon the sleeping things.  Roaring and shrieking in pain and\nanger the creatures stumbled to their feet and lumbered awkwardly into\nthe open.  Two of them turned upon their tormentor, but the burning\nweapon on their ill protected flesh sent them staggering back out of\nreach, and in another moment all were huddled in the center of the\ncampong.\n\nAs cattle are driven, von Horn drove the miserable creatures toward the\ndoor of the workshop.  At the threshold of the dark interior the\nfrightened things halted fearfully, and then as von Horn urged them on\nfrom behind with his cruel whip they milled as cattle at the entrance\nto a strange corral.\n\nAgain and again he urged them for the door, but each time they turned\naway, and to escape the whip beat and tore at the wall of the palisade\nin a vain effort to batter it from their pathway.  Their roars and\nshrieks were almost deafening as von Horn, losing what little remained\nof his scant self-control, dashed among them laying to right and left\nwith the stern whip and the butt of his heavy revolver.\n\nMost of the monsters scattered and turned back into the center of the\nenclosure, but three of them were forced through the doorway into the\nworkshop, from the darkness of which they saw the patch of moonlight\nthrough the open door upon the opposite side.  Toward this they\nscurried as von Horn turned back into the court of mystery for the\nothers.\n\nThree more herculean efforts he made before he beat the last of the\ncreatures through the outer doorway of the workshop into the north\ncampong.\n\n\nAmong the age old arts of the celestials none is more strangely\ninspiring than that of medicine.  Odd herbs and unspeakable things when\nproperly compounded under a favorable aspect of the heavenly bodies are\npotent to achieve miraculous cures, and few are the Chinamen who do not\nbrew some special concoction of their own devising for the lesser ills\nwhich beset mankind.\n\nSing was no exception in this respect.  In various queerly shaped,\nbamboo covered jars he maintained a supply of tonics, balms and\nlotions.  His first thought when he had made Professor Maxon\ncomfortable upon the couch was to fetch his pet nostrum, for there\nburned strong within his yellow breast the same powerful yearning to\nexperiment that marks the greatest of the profession to whose mysteries\nhe aspired.\n\nThough the hideous noises from the inner campong rose threateningly,\nthe imperturbable Sing left the bungalow and passed across the north\ncampong to the little lean-to that he had built for himself against the\npalisade that separated the north enclosure from the court of mystery.\n\nHere he rummaged about in the dark until he had found the two phials he\nsought.  The noise of the monsters upon the opposite side of the\npalisade had now assumed the dimensions of pandemonium, and through it\nall the Chinaman heard the constant crack that was the sharp voice of\nthe bull whip.\n\nHe had completed his search and was about to return to the bungalow\nwhen the first of the monsters emerged into the north campong from the\nworkshop.  At the door of his shack Sing Lee drew back to watch, for he\nknew that behind them some one was driving these horribly grotesque\ncreatures from their prison.\n\nOne by one they came lumbering into the moonlight until Sing had\ncounted eleven, and then, after them, came a white man, bull whip and\nrevolver in hand.  It was von Horn.  The equatorial moon shone full\nupon him--there could be no mistake.  The Chinaman saw him turn and\nlock the workshop door; saw him cross the campong to the outer gate;\nsaw him pass through toward the jungle, closing the gate.\n\nOf a sudden there was a sad, low moaning through the surrounding trees;\ndense, black clouds obscured the radiant moon; and then with hideous\nthunder and vivid flashes of lightning the tempest broke in all its\nfury of lashing wind and hurtling deluge.  It was the first great storm\nof the breaking up of the monsoon, and under the cover of its darkness\nSing Lee scurried through the monster filled campong to the bungalow.\nWithin he found the young man bathing Professor Maxon's head as he had\ndirected him to do.\n\n\"All gettee out,\" he said, jerking his thumb in the direction of the\ncourt of mystery.  \"Eleven devils.  Plenty soon come bung'low.  What\ndo?\"\n\nNumber Thirteen had seen von Horn's extra bull whip hanging upon a peg\nin the living room.  For answer he stepped into that room and took the\nweapon down.  Then he returned to the professor's side.\n\nOutside the frightened monsters groped through the blinding rain and\ndarkness in search of shelter.  Each vivid lightning flash, and\nbellowing of booming thunder brought responsive cries of rage and\nterror from their hideous lips.  It was Number Twelve who first spied\nthe dim light showing through the bungalow's living room window.  With\na low guttural to his companions he started toward the building.  Up\nthe low steps to the verandah they crept.  Number Twelve peered through\nthe window.  He saw no one within, but there was warmth and dryness.\n\nHis little knowledge and lesser reasoning faculties suggested no\nthought of a doorway.  With a blow he shattered the glass of the\nwindow.  Then he forced his body through the narrow aperture.  At the\nsame moment a gust of wind sucking through the broken panes drew open\nthe door, and as Number Thirteen, warned by the sound of breaking\nglass, sprang into the living room he was confronted by the entire\nhorde of misshapen beings.\n\nHis heart went out in pity toward the miserable crew, but he knew that\nhis life as well as those of the two men in the adjoining room depended\nupon the force and skill with which he might handle the grave crisis\nwhich confronted them.  He had seen and talked with most of the\ncreatures when from time to time they had been brought singly into the\nworkshop that their creator might mitigate the wrong he had done by\ntraining the poor minds with which he had endowed them to reason\nintelligently.\n\nA few were hopeless imbeciles, unable to comprehend more than the\nrudimentary requirements of filling their bellies when food was placed\nbefore them; yet even these were endowed with superhuman strength; and\nwhen aroused battled the more fiercely for the very reason of their\nbrainlessness.  Others, like Number Twelve, were of a higher order of\nintelligence.  They spoke English, and, after a fashion, reasoned in a\ncrude sort of way.  These were by far the most dangerous, for as the\npower of comparison is the fundamental principle of reasoning, so they\nwere able to compare their lot with that of the few other men they had\nseen, and with the help of von Horn to partially appreciate the\nhorrible wrong that had been done them.\n\nVon Horn, too, had let them know the identity of their creator, and\nthus implanted in their malformed brains the insidious poison of\nrevenge.  Envy and jealousy were there as well, and hatred of all\nbeings other than themselves.  They envied the ease and comparative\nbeauty of the old professor and his assistant, and hated the latter for\nthe cruelty of the bull whip and the constant menace of the ever ready\nrevolver; and so as they were to them the representatives of the great\nhuman world of which they could never be a part, their envy and\njealousy and hatred of these men embraced the entire race which they\nrepresented.\n\nIt was such that Number Thirteen faced as he emerged from the\nprofessor's apartment.\n\n\"What do you want here?\" he said, addressing Number Twelve, who stood a\nlittle in advance of the others.\n\n\"We have come for Maxon,\" growled the creature.  \"We have been penned\nup long enough.  We want to be out here.  We have come to kill Maxon\nand you and all who have made us what we are.\"\n\n\"Why do you wish to kill me?\" asked the young man.  \"I am one of you.\nI was made in the same way that you were made.\"\n\nNumber Twelve opened his mismated eyes in astonishment.\n\n\"Then you have already killed Maxon?\" he asked.\n\n\"No.  He was wounded by a savage enemy.  I have been helping to make\nhim well again.  He has wronged me as much as he has you.  If I do not\nwish to kill him, why should you?  He did not mean to wrong us.  He\nthought that he was doing right.  He is in trouble now and we should\nstay and protect him.\"\n\n\"He lies,\" suddenly shouted another of the horde.  \"He is not one of\nus.  Kill him!  Kill him!  Kill Maxon, too, and then we shall be as\nother men, for it is these men who keep us as we are.\"\n\nThe fellow started forward toward Number Thirteen as he spoke, and\nmoved by the impulse of imitation the others came on with him.\n\n\"I have spoken fairly to you,\" said Number Thirteen in a low voice.\n\"If you cannot understand fairness here is something you can\nunderstand.\"\n\nRaising the bull whip above his head the young giant leaped among the\nadvancing brutes and lay about him with mighty strokes that put to\nshame the comparatively feeble blows with which von Horn had been wont\nto deal out punishment to the poor, damned creatures of the court of\nmystery.\n\nFor a moment they stood valiantly before his attack, but after two had\ngrappled with him and been hurled headlong to the floor they gave up\nand rushed incontinently out into the maelstrom of the screaming\ntempest.\n\nIn the doorway behind him Sing Lee had been standing waiting the\noutcome of the encounter and ready to lend a hand were it required.  As\nthe two men turned back into the professor's room they saw that the\nwounded man's eyes were open and upon them.  At sight of Number\nThirteen a questioning look came into his eyes.\n\n\"What has happened?\" he asked feebly of Sing.  \"Where is my daughter?\nWhere is Dr. von Horn?  What is this creature doing out of his pen?\"\n\nThe blow of the parang upon the professor's skull had shocked his\noverwrought mind back into the path of sanity.  It had left him with a\nclear remembrance of the past, other than the recent fight in the\nliving room--that was a blank--and it had given him a clearer\nperspective of the plans he had been entertaining for so long relative\nto this soulless creature.\n\nThe first thought that sprang to his mind as he saw Number Thirteen\nbefore him was of his mad intention to give his daughter to such a\nmonstrous thing.  With the recollection came a sudden loathing and\nhatred of this and the other creatures of his unholy experimentations.\n\nPresently he realized that his questions had not been answered.\n\n\"Sing!\" he shouted.  \"Answer me.  Where are Virginia and Dr. von Horn?\"\n\n\"All gonee.  Me no know.  All gonee.  Maybeso allee dead.\"\n\n\"My God!\" groaned the stricken man; and then his eyes again falling\nupon the silent giant in the doorway, \"Out of my sight,\" he shrieked.\n\"Out of my sight!  Never let me see you again--and to think that I\nwould have given my only daughter to a soulless thing like you.  Away!\nBefore I go mad and slay you.\"\n\nSlowly the color mounted to the neck and face of the giant--then\nsuddenly it receded, leaving him as ashen as death.  His great hand\ngripped the stock of the bull whip.  A single blow was all that would\nhave been needed to silence Professor Maxon forever.  There was murder\nin the wounded heart.  The man took a step forward into the room, and\nthen something drew his eyes to a spot upon the wall just above\nProfessor Maxon's shoulder--it was a photograph of Virginia Maxon.\n\nWithout a word Number Thirteen turned upon his heel and passed out into\nthe storm.\n\n\n\n8\n\nTHE SOUL OF NUMBER 13\n\n\nScarcely had the Ithaca cleared the reef which lies almost across the\nmouth of the little harbor where she had been moored for so many months\nthan the tempest broke upon her in all its terrific fury.  Bududreen\nwas no mean sailor, but he was short handed, nor is it reasonable to\nsuppose that even with a full crew he could have weathered the terrific\ngale which beat down upon the hapless vessel.  Buffeted by great waves,\nand stripped of every shred of canvas by the force of the mighty wind\nthat howled about her, the Ithaca drifted a hopeless wreck soon after\nthe storm struck her.\n\nBelow deck the terrified girl clung desperately to a stanchion as the\nstricken ship lunged sickeningly before the hurricane.  For half an\nhour the awful suspense endured, and then with a terrific crash the\nvessel struck, shivering and trembling from stem to stern.\n\nVirginia Maxon sank to her knees in prayer, for this she thought must\nsurely be the end.  On deck Bududreen and his crew had lashed\nthemselves to the masts, and as the Ithaca struck the reef before the\nharbor, back upon which she had been driven, the tall poles with their\nliving freight snapped at the deck and went overboard carrying every\nthing with them amid shrieks and cries of terror that were drowned and\nchoked by the wild tumult of the night.\n\nTwice the girl felt the ship strike upon the reef, then a great wave\ncaught and carried her high into the air, dropping her with a\nnauseating lunge which seemed to the imprisoned girl to be carrying the\nship to the very bottom of the ocean.  With closed eyes she clung in\nsilent prayer beside her berth waiting for the moment that would bring\nthe engulfing waters and oblivion--praying that the end might come\nspeedily and release her from the torture of nervous apprehension that\nhad terrorized her for what seemed an eternity.\n\nAfter the last, long dive the Ithaca righted herself laboriously,\nwallowing drunkenly, but apparently upon an even keel in less turbulent\nwaters.  One long minute dragged after another, yet no suffocating\ndeluge poured in upon the girl, and presently she realized that the\nship had, at least temporarily, weathered the awful buffeting of the\nsavage elements.  Now she felt but a gentle roll, though the wild\nturmoil of the storm still came to her ears through the heavy planking\nof the Ithaca's hull.\n\nFor a long hour she lay wondering what fate had overtaken the vessel\nand whither she had been driven, and then, with a gentle grinding\nsound, the ship stopped, swung around, and finally came to rest with a\nslight list to starboard.  The wind howled about her, the torrential\nrain beat loudly upon her, but except for a slight rocking the ship lay\nquiet.\n\nHours passed with no other sounds than those of the rapidly waning\ntempest.  The girl heard no signs of life upon the ship.  Her curiosity\nbecame more and more keenly aroused.  She had that indefinable,\nintuitive feeling that she was utterly alone upon the vessel, and at\nlength, unable to endure the inaction and uncertainty longer, made her\nway to the companion ladder where for half an hour she futilely\nattempted to remove the hatch.\n\nAs she worked she failed to hear the scraping of naked bodies\nclambering over the ship's side, or the padding of unshod feet upon the\ndeck above her.  She was about to give up her work at the hatch when\nthe heavy wooden cover suddenly commenced to move above her as though\nactuated by some supernatural power.  Fascinated, the girl stood gazing\nin wide-eyed astonishment as one end of the hatch rose higher and\nhigher until a little patch of blue sky revealed the fact that morning\nhad come.  Then the cover slid suddenly back and Virginia Maxon found\nherself looking into a savage and terrible face.\n\nThe dark skin was creased in fierce wrinkles about the eyes and mouth.\nGleaming tiger cat's teeth curved upward from holes pierced to receive\nthem in the upper half of each ear.  The slit ear lobes supported heavy\nrings whose weight had stretched the skin until the long loop rested\nupon the brown shoulders.  The filed and blackened teeth behind the\nloose lips added the last touch of hideousness to this terrible\ncountenance.\n\nNor was this all.  A score of equally ferocious faces peered down from\nbehind the foremost.  With a little scream Virginia Maxon sprang back\nto the lower deck and ran toward her stateroom.  Behind her she heard\nthe commotion of many men descending the companionway.\n\n\nAs Number Thirteen came into the campong after quitting the bungalow\nhis heart was a chaos of conflicting emotions.  His little world had\nbeen wiped out.  His creator--the man whom he thought his only friend\nand benefactor--had suddenly turned against him.  The beautiful\ncreature he worshipped was either lost or dead; Sing had said so.  He\nwas nothing but a miserable THING.  There was no place in the world for\nhim, and even should he again find Virginia Maxon, he had von Horn's\nword for it that she would shrink from him and loathe him even more\nthan another.\n\nWith no plans and no hopes he walked aimlessly through the blinding\nrain, oblivious of it and of the vivid lightning and deafening thunder.\nThe palisade at length brought him to a sudden stop.  Mechanically he\nsquatted on his haunches with his back against it, and there, in the\nmidst of the fury of the storm he conquered the tempest that raged in\nhis own breast.  The murder that rose again and again in his untaught\nheart he forced back by thoughts of the sweet, pure face of the girl\nwhose image he had set up in the inner temple of his being, as a\ngentle, guiding divinity.\n\n\"He made me without a soul,\" he repeated over and over again to\nhimself, \"but I have found a soul--she shall be my soul.  Von Horn\ncould not explain to me what a soul is.  He does not know.  None of\nthem knows.  I am wiser than all the rest, for I have learned what a\nsoul is.  Eyes cannot see it--fingers cannot feel it, but he who\npossess it knows that it is there for it fills his whole breast with a\ngreat, wonderful love and worship for something infinitely finer than\nman's dull senses can gauge--something that guides him into paths far\nabove the plain of soulless beasts and bestial men.\n\n\"Let those who will say that I have no soul, for I am satisfied with\nthe soul I have found.  It would never permit me to inflict on others\nthe terrible wrong that Professor Maxon has inflicted on me--yet he\nnever doubts his own possession of a soul.  It would not allow me to\nrevel in the coarse brutalities of von Horn--and I am sure that von\nHorn thinks he has a soul.  And if the savage men who came tonight to\nkill have souls, then I am glad that my soul is after my own\nchoosing--I would not care for one like theirs.\"\n\nThe sudden equatorial dawn found the man still musing.  The storm had\nceased and as the daylight brought the surroundings to view Number\nThirteen became aware that he was not alone in the campong.  All about\nhim lay the eleven terrible men whom he had driven from the bungalow\nthe previous night.  The sight of them brought a realization of new\nresponsibilities.  To leave them here in the campong would mean the\nimmediate death of Professor Maxon and the Chinaman.  To turn them into\nthe jungle might mean a similar fate for Virginia Maxon were she\nwandering about in search of the encampment--  Number Thirteen could\nnot believe that she was dead.  It seemed too monstrous to believe that\nhe should never see her again, and he knew so little of death that it\nwas impossible for him to realize that that beautiful creature ever\ncould cease to be filled with the vivacity of life.\n\nThe young man had determined to leave the camp himself--partly on\naccount of the cruel words Professor Maxon had hurled at him the night\nbefore, but principally in order that he might search for the lost\ngirl.  Of course he had not the remotest idea where to look for her,\nbut as von Horn had explained that they were upon a small island he\nfelt reasonably sure that he should find her in time.\n\nAs he looked at the sleeping monsters near him he determined that the\nonly solution of his problem was to take them all with him.  Number\nTwelve lay closest to him, and stepping to his side he nudged him with\nthe butt of the bull whip he still carried.  The creature opened his\ndull eyes.\n\n\"Get up,\" said Number Thirteen.\n\nNumber Twelve rose, looking askance at the bull whip.\n\n\"We are not wanted here,\" said Number Thirteen.  \"I am going away and\nyou are all going with me.  We shall find a place where we may live in\npeace and freedom.  Are you not tired of always being penned up?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Number Twelve, still looking at the whip.\n\n\"You need not fear the whip,\" said the young man.  \"I shall not use it\non those who make no trouble.  Wake the others and tell them what I\nhave said.  All must come with me--those who refuse shall feel the\nwhip.\"\n\nNumber Twelve did as he was bid.  The creatures mumbled among\nthemselves for a few minutes.  Finally Number Thirteen cracked his long\nwhip to attract their attention.\n\n\"Come!\" he said.\n\nNine of them shuffled after him as he turned toward the outer\ngate--only Number Ten and Number Three held back.  The young man walked\nquickly to where they stood eyeing him sullenly.  The others halted to\nwatch--ready to spring upon their new master should the tide of the\nimpending battle turn against him.  The two mutineers backed away\nsnarling, their hideous features distorted in rage.\n\n\"Come!\" repeated Number Thirteen.\n\n\"We will stay here,\" growled Number Ten.  \"We have not yet finished\nwith Maxon.\"\n\nA loop in the butt of the bull whip was about the young man's wrist.\nDropping the weapon from his hand it still dangled by the loop.  At the\nsame instant he launched himself at the throat of Number Ten, for he\nrealized that a decisive victory now without the aid of the weapon they\nall feared would make the balance of his work easier.\n\nThe brute met the charge with lowered head and outstretched hands, and\nin another second they were locked in a clinch, tearing at one another\nlike two great gorillas.  For a moment Number Three stood watching the\nbattle, and then he too sprang in to aid his fellow mutineer.  Number\nThirteen was striking heavy blows with his giant hands upon the face\nand head of his antagonist, while the long, uneven fangs of the latter\nhad found his breast and neck a half dozen times.  Blood covered them\nboth.  Number Three threw his enormous weight into the conflict with\nthe frenzy of a mad bull.\n\nAgain and again he got a hold upon the young giant's throat only to be\nshaken loose by the mighty muscles.  The excitement of the conflict was\ntelling upon the malformed minds of the spectators.  Presently one who\nwas almost brainless, acting upon the impulse of suggestion, leaped in\namong the fighters, striking and biting at Number Thirteen.  It was all\nthat was needed--another second found the whole monstrous crew upon the\nsingle man.\n\nHis mighty strength availed him but little in the unequal\nconflict--eleven to one were too great odds even for those powerful\nthews.  His great advantage lay in his superior intelligence, but even\nthis seemed futile in the face of the enormous weight of numbers that\nopposed him.  Time and again he had almost shaken himself free only to\nfall once more--dragged down by hairy arms about his legs.\n\nHither and thither about the campong the battle raged until the\nfighting mass rolled against the palisade, and here, at last, with his\nback to the structure, Number Thirteen regained his feet, and with the\nheavy stock of the bull whip beat off, for a moment, those nearest him.\nAll were winded, but when those who were left of the eleven original\nantagonists drew back to regain their breath, the young giant gave them\nno respite, but leaped among them with the long lash they had such good\nreason to hate and fear.\n\nThe result was as his higher intelligence had foreseen--the creatures\nscattered to escape the fury of the lash and a moment later he had them\nat his mercy.  About the campong lay four who had felt the full force\nof his heavy fist, while not one but bore some mark of the battle.\n\nNot a moment did he give them to recuperate after he had scattered them\nbefore he rounded them up once more near the outer gate--but now they\nwere docile and submissive.  In pairs he ordered them to lift their\nunconscious comrades to their shoulders and bear them into the jungle,\nfor Number Thirteen was setting out into the world with his grim tribe\nin search of his lady love.\n\nOnce well within the jungle they halted to eat of the more familiar\nfruit which had always formed the greater bulk of their sustenance.\nThus refreshed, they set out once more after the leader who wandered\naimlessly beneath the shade of the tall jungle trees amidst the\ngorgeous tropic blooms and gay, songless birds--and of the twelve only\nthe leader saw the beauties that surrounded them or felt the strange,\nmysterious influence of the untracked world they trod.  Chance took\nthem toward the west until presently they emerged upon the harbor's\nedge, where from the matted jungle they overlooked for the first time\nthe waters of the little bay and the broader expanse of strait beyond,\nuntil their eyes rested at last upon the blurred lines of distant\nBorneo.\n\nFrom other vantage points at the jungle's border two other watchers\nlooked out upon the scene.  One was the lascar whom von Horn had sent\ndown to the Ithaca the night before but who had reached the harbor\nafter she sailed.  The other was von Horn himself.  And both were\nlooking out upon the dismantled wreck of the Ithaca where it lay in the\nsand near the harbor's southern edge.\n\nNeither ventured forth from his place of concealment, for beyond the\nIthaca ten prahus were pulling gracefully into the quiet waters of the\nbasin.\n\nRajah Muda Saffir, caught by the hurricane the preceding night as he\nhad been about to beat across to Borneo, had scurried for shelter\nwithin one of the many tiny coves which indent the island's entire\ncoast.  It happened that his haven of refuge was but a short distance\nsouth of the harbor in which he knew the Ithaca to be moored, and in\nthe morning he decided to pay that vessel a visit in the hope that he\nmight learn something of advantage about the girl from one of her\nlascar crew.\n\nThe wily Malay had long refrained from pillaging the Ithaca for fear\nsuch an act might militate against the larger villainy he purposed\nperpetrating against her white owner, but when he rounded the point and\ncame in sight of the stranded wreck he put all such thoughts from him\nand made straight for the helpless hulk to glean whatever of salvage\nmight yet remain within her battered hull.\n\nThe old rascal had little thought of the priceless treasure hidden\nbeneath the Ithaca's clean swept deck as he ordered his savage henchmen\nup her sides while he lay back upon his sleeping mat beneath the canopy\nwhich protected his vice-regal head from the blistering tropic sun.\n\nNumber Thirteen watched the wild head hunters with keenest interest as\nthey clambered aboard the vessel.  With von Horn he saw the evident\namazement which followed the opening of the hatch, though neither\nguessed its cause.  He saw the haste with which a half dozen of the\nwarriors leaped down the companionway and heard their savage shouts as\nthey pursued their quarry within the bowels of the ship.\n\nA few minutes later they emerged dragging a woman with them.  Von Horn\nand Number Thirteen recognized the girl simultaneously, but the doctor,\nthough he ground his teeth in futile rage, knew that he was helpless to\navert the tragedy.  Number Thirteen neither knew nor cared.\n\n\"Come!\" he called to his grotesque horde.  \"Kill the men and save the\ngirl--the one with the golden hair,\" he added as the sudden realization\ncame to him that none of these creatures ever had seen a woman before.\nThen he dashed from the shelter of the jungle, across the beach and\ninto the water, his fearful pack at his heels.\n\nThe Ithaca lay now in about five feet of water, and the war prahus of\nMuda Saffir rode upon her seaward side, so that those who manned them\ndid not see the twelve who splashed through the water from land.  Never\nbefore had any of the rescuers seen a larger body of water than the\nlittle stream which wound through their campong, but accidents and\nexperiments in that had taught them the danger of submerging their\nheads.  They could not swim, but all were large and strong, so that\nthey were able to push their way rapidly through the water to the very\nside of the ship.\n\nHere they found difficulty in reaching the deck, but in a moment Number\nThirteen had solved the problem by requiring one of the taller of his\ncrew to stand close in by the ship while the others clambered upon his\nshoulders and from there to the Ithaca's deck.\n\nNumber Thirteen was the first to pull himself over the vessel's side,\nand as he did so he saw some half dozen Dyaks preparing to quit her\nupon the opposite side.  They were the last of the boarding party--the\ngirl was nowhere in sight.  Without waiting for his men the young giant\nsprang across the deck.  His one thought was to find Virginia Maxon.\n\nAt the sound of his approach the Dyak turned, and at the sight of a\npajama clad white man armed only with a long whip they emitted savage\ncries of anticipation, counting the handsome trophy upon the white\none's shoulders as already theirs.  Number Thirteen would have paid no\nattention whatever to them had they not molested him, for he wished\nonly to reach the girl's side as quickly as possible; but in another\nmoment he found himself confronted by a half dozen dancing wild men,\nbrandishing wicked looking parangs, and crying tauntingly.\n\nUp went the great bull whip, and without abating his speed a particle\nthe man leaped into the midst of the wicked blades that menaced him.\nRight and left with the quickness of thought the heavy lash fell upon\nheads, shoulders and sword arms.  There was no chance to wield a blade\nin the face of that terrific onslaught, for the whip fell, not with the\nordinary force of a man-held lash, but with all the stupendous power of\nthose giant shoulders and arms behind it.\n\nA single blow felled the foremost head hunter, breaking his shoulder\nand biting into the flesh and bone as a heavy sword bites.  Again and\nagain the merciless leather fell, while in the boats below Muda Saffir\nand his men shouted loud cries of encouragement to their companions on\nthe ship, and a wide-eyed girl in the stern of Muda Saffir's own prahu\nlooked on in terror, hope and admiration at the man of her own race\nwhom she felt was battling against all these odds for her alone.\n\nVirginia Maxon recognized her champion instantly as he who had fought\nfor her and saved her once before, from the hideous creature of her\nfather's experiments.  With hands tight pressed against her bosom the\ngirl leaned forward, tense with excitement, watching every move of the\nlithe, giant figure, as, silhouetted against the brazen tropic sky, it\ntowered above the dancing, shrieking head hunters who writhed beneath\nthe awful lash.\n\nMuda Saffir saw that the battle was going against his men, and it\nfilled him with anger.  Turning to one of his headmen he ordered two\nmore boatloads of warriors to the Ithaca's deck.  As they were rushing\nto obey their leader's command there was a respite in the fighting on\nthe ship, for the three who had not fallen beneath the bull whip had\nleaped overboard to escape the fate which had overtaken their comrades.\n\nAs the reinforcements started to scale the vessel's side Number\nThirteen's searching eyes found the girl in Muda Saffir's prahu, where\nit lay a little off from the Ithaca, and as the first of the enemy\nclambered over the rail she saw a smile of encouragement light the\nclear cut features of the man above her.  Virginia Maxon sent back an\nanswering smile--a smile that filled the young giant's heart with pride\nand happiness--such a smile as brave men have been content to fight and\ndie for since woman first learned the art of smiling.\n\nNumber Thirteen could have beaten back many of the reinforcing party\nbefore they reached the deck, but he did not care to do so.  In the\nspontaneous ethics of the man there seemed no place for an unfair\nadvantage over an enemy, and added to this was his newly acquired love\nof battle, so he was content to wait until his foes stood on an even\nfooting with him before he engaged them.  But they never came within\nreach of his ready lash.  Instead, as they came above the ship's side\nthey paused, wide-eyed and terror stricken, and with cries of fear and\nconsternation dropped precipitately back into the sea, shouting\nwarnings to those who were about to scale the hull.\n\nMuda Saffir arose in his prahu cursing and reviling the frightened\nDyaks.  He did not know the cause of their alarm, but presently he saw\nit behind the giant upon the Ithaca's deck--eleven horrible\nmonstrosities lumbering forward, snarling and growling, to their\nleader's side.\n\nAt the sight his own dark countenance went ashen, and with trembling\nlips he ordered his oarsmen to pull for the open sea.  The girl, too,\nsaw the frightful creatures that surrounded the man upon the deck.  She\nthought that they were about to attack him, and gave a little cry of\nwarning, but in another instant she realized that they were his\ncompanions, for with him they rushed to the side of the ship to stand\nfor a moment looking down upon the struggling Dyaks in the water below.\n\nTwo prahus lay directly beneath them, and into these the head hunters\nwere scrambling.  The balance of the flotilla was now making rapid\nheadway under oars and sail toward the mouth of the harbor, and as\nNumber Thirteen saw that the girl was being borne away from him, he\nshouted a command to his misshapen crew, and without waiting to see if\nthey would follow him leaped into the nearer of the two boats beneath.\n\nIt was already half filled with Dyaks, some of whom were hastily\nmanning the oars.  Others of the head hunters were scrambling over the\ngunwale.  In an instant pandemonium reigned in the little vessel.\nSavage warriors sprang toward the tall figure towering above them.\nParangs flashed.  The bull whip hissed and cracked, and then into the\nmidst of it all came a horrid avalanche of fearful and grotesque\nmonsters--the young giant's crew had followed at his command.\n\nThe battle in the prahu was short and fierce.  For an instant the Dyaks\nattempted to hold their own, but in the face of the snarling, rending\nhorde that engulfed them terror got the better of them all, so that\nthose who were not overcome dived overboard and swam rapidly toward\nshore.\n\nThe other prahu had not waited to assist its companion, but before it\nwas entirely filled had gotten under way and was now rapidly\noverhauling the balance of the fleet.\n\nVon Horn had been an excited witness to all that had occurred upon the\ntranquil bosom of the little harbor.  He had been filled with\nastonishment at sight of the inhabitants of the court of mystery\nfighting under the leadership of Number Thirteen, and now he watched\ninterestedly the outcome of the adventure.\n\nThe sight of the girl being borne away in the prahu of the Malay rajah\nto a fate worse than death, had roused in him both keen regret and\nsavage rage, but it was the life of ease that he was losing that\nconcerned him most.  He had felt so sure of winning Professor Maxon's\nfortune through either a forced or voluntary marriage with the girl\nthat his feelings now were as of one whose rightful heritage has been\nfoully wrested from him.  The thought of the girl's danger and\nsuffering were of but secondary consideration to him, for the man was\nincapable of either deep love or true chivalry.\n\nQuite the contrary were the emotions which urged on the soulless\ncreature who now found himself in undisputed possession of a Dyak war\nprahu.  His only thought was of the girl being rapidly borne away\nacross the glimmering waters of the strait.  He knew not to what\ndangers she was exposed, or what fate threatened her.  All he knew was\nthat she had been taken by force against her will.  He had seen the\nlook of terror in her eyes, and the dawning hope die out as the boat\nthat carried her had turned rapidly away from the Ithaca.  His one\nthought now was to rescue her from her abductors and return her to her\nfather.  Of his own reward or profit he entertained no single\nthought--it was enough if he could fight for her.  That would be reward\nsufficient.\n\nNeither Number Thirteen nor any of his crew had ever before seen a\nboat, and outside of the leader there was scarcely enough brains in the\nentire party to render it at all likely that they could ever navigate\nit, but the young man saw that the other prahus were being propelled by\nthe long sticks which protruded from their sides, and he also saw the\nsails bellying with wind, though he had but a vague conception of their\npurpose.\n\nFor a moment he stood watching the actions of the men in the nearest\nboat, and then he set himself to the task of placing his own men at the\noars and instructing them in the manner of wielding the unfamiliar\nimplements.  For an hour he worked with the brainless things that\nconstituted his party.  They could not seem to learn what was required\nof them.  The paddles were continually fouling one another, or being\nmerely dipped into the water and withdrawn without the faintest\nsemblance of a stroke made.\n\nThe tiresome maneuvering had carried them about in circles back and\nforth across the harbor, but by it Number Thirteen had himself learned\nsomething of the proper method of propelling and steering his craft.\nAt last, more through accident than intent, they came opposite the\nmouth of the basin, and then chance did for them what days of arduous\nendeavor upon their part might have failed to accomplish.\n\nAs they hung wavering in the opening, the broad strait before them, and\ntheir quarry fast diminishing to small specks upon the distant horizon,\na vagrant land breeze suddenly bellied the flapping sail.  The prahu\nswung quickly about with nose pointed toward the sea, the sail filled,\nand the long, narrow craft shot out of the harbor and sped on over the\ndancing waters in the wake of her sisters.\n\nOn shore behind them the infuriated Dyaks who had escaped to the beach\ndanced and shrieked; von Horn, from his hiding place, looked on in\nsurprised wonder, and Bududreen's lascar cursed the fate that had left\na party of forty head hunters upon the same small island with him.\n\nSmaller and smaller grew the retreating prahu as, straight as an arrow,\nshe sped toward the dim outline of verdure clad Borneo.\n\n\n\n9\n\nINTO SAVAGE BORNEO\n\n\nVon Horn cursed the chance that had snatched the girl from him, but he\ntried to content himself with the thought that the treasure probably\nstill rested in the cabin of the Ithaca, where Bududreen was to have\ndeposited it.  He wished that the Dyaks would take themselves off so\nthat he could board the vessel and carry the chest ashore to bury it\nagainst the time that fate should provide a means for transporting it\nto Singapore.\n\nIn the water below him floated the Ithaca's masts, their grisly burdens\nstill lashed to their wave swept sides.  Bududreen lay there, his\ncontorted features set in a horrible grimace of death which grinned up\nat the man he would have cheated, as though conscious of the fact that\nthe white man would have betrayed him had the opportunity come, the\nwhile he enjoyed in anticipation the other's disappointment in the loss\nof both the girl and the treasure.\n\nThe tide was rising now, and presently the Ithaca began to float.  No\nsooner was it apparent that she was free than the Dyaks sprang into the\nwater and swam to her side.  Like monkeys they scrambled aboard,\nswarming below deck in search, thought von Horn, of pillage.  He prayed\nthat they would not discover the chest.\n\nPresently a half dozen of them leaped overboard and swam to the mass of\ntangled spars and rigging which littered the beach.  Selecting what\nthey wished they returned to the vessel, and a few minutes later von\nHorn was chagrined to see them stepping a jury mast--he thought the\ntreasure lay in the Ithaca's cabin.\n\nBefore dark the vessel moved slowly out of the harbor, setting a course\nacross the strait in the direction that the war prahus had taken.  When\nit was apparent that there was no danger that the head hunters would\nreturn, the lascar came from his hiding place, and dancing up and down\nupon the shore screamed warlike challenges and taunts at the retreating\nenemy.\n\nVon Horn also came forth, much to the sailor's surprise, and in silence\nthe two stood watching the disappearing ship.  At length they turned\nand made their way up the stream toward camp--there was no longer aught\nto fear there.  Von Horn wondered if the creatures he had loosed upon\nProfessor Maxon had done their work before they left, or if they had\nall turned to mush as had Number Thirteen.\n\nOnce at the encampment his questions were answered, for he saw a light\nin the bungalow, and as he mounted the steps there were Sing and\nProfessor Maxon just coming from the living room.\n\n\"Von Horn!\" exclaimed the professor.  \"You, then, are not dead; but\nwhere is Virginia?  Tell me that she is safe.\"\n\n\"She has been carried away,\" was the startling answer.  \"Your creatures,\nunder the thing you wished to marry her to, have taken her to Borneo\nwith a band of Malay and Dyak pirates.  I was alone and could do\nnothing to prevent them.\"\n\n\"God!\" moaned the old man.  \"Why did I not kill the thing when it stood\nwithin my power to do so.  Only last night he was here beside me, and\nnow it is too late.\"\n\n\"I warned you,\" said von Horn, coldly.\n\n\"I was mad,\" retorted the professor.  \"Could you not see that I was\nmad?  Oh, why did you not stop me?  You were sane enough.  You at least\nmight have forced me to abandon the insane obsession which has\noverpowered my reason for all these terrible months.  I am sane now,\nbut it is too late--too late.\"\n\n\"Both you and your daughter could only have interpreted any such action\non my part as instigated by self-interest, for you both knew that I\nwanted to make her my wife,\" replied the other.  \"My hands were tied.\nI am sorry now that I did not act, but you can readily see the position\nin which I was placed.\"\n\n\"Can nothing be done to get her back?\" cried the father.  \"There must\nbe some way to save her.  Do it von Horn, and not only is my daughter\nyours but my wealth as well--every thing that I possess shall be yours\nif you will but save her from those frightful creatures.\"\n\n\"The Ithaca is gone, too,\" replied the doctor.  \"There is only a small\nboat that I hid in the jungle for some such emergency.  It will carry\nus to Borneo, but what can we four do against five hundred pirates and\nthe dozen monsters you have brought into the world?  No, Professor\nMaxon, I fear there is little hope, though I am willing to give my life\nin an attempt to save Virginia.  You will not forget your promise\nshould we succeed?\"\n\n\"No, doctor,\" replied the old man.  \"I swear that you shall have\nVirginia as your wife, and all my property shall be made over to you if\nshe is rescued.\"\n\nSing Lee had been a silent listener to this strange conversation.  An\nodd look came into his slant eyes as he heard von Horn exact a\nconfirmation from the professor, but what passed in his shrewd mind\nonly he could say.\n\nIt was too late to attempt to make a start that day for Borneo, as\ndarkness had already fallen.  Professor Maxon and von Horn walked over\nto the workshop and the inner campong to ascertain what damage had been\ndone there.\n\nOn their return Sing was setting the table on the verandah for the\nevening meal.  The two men were talking, and without making his\npresence noticeable the Chinaman hovered about ever within ear shot.\n\n\"I cannot make it out, von Horn,\" Professor Maxon was saying.  \"Not a\nboard broken, and the doors both apparently opened intentionally by\nsomeone familiar with locks and bolts.  Who could have done it?\"\n\n\"You forget Number Thirteen,\" suggested the doctor.\n\n\"But the chest!\" expostulated the other.  \"What in the world would he\nwant of that enormous and heavy chest?\"\n\n\"He might have thought that it contained treasure,\" hazarded von Horn,\nin an innocent tone of voice.\n\n\"Bosh, my dear man,\" replied Professor Maxon.  \"He knew nothing of\ntreasures, or money, or the need or value of either.  I tell you the\nworkshop was opened, and the inner campong as well by some one who knew\nthe value of money and wanted that chest, but why they should have\nreleased the creatures from the inner enclosure is beyond me.\"\n\n\"And I tell you Professor Maxon that it could have been none other than\nNumber Thirteen,\" insisted von Horn.  \"Did I not myself see him leading\nhis eleven monsters as easily as a captain commands his company?  The\nfellow is brighter than we have imagined.  He has learned much from us\nboth, he has reasoned, and he has shrewdly guessed many things that he\ncould not have known through experience.\"\n\n\"But his object?\" asked the professor.\n\n\"That is simple,\" returned von Horn.  \"You have held out hopes to him\nthat soon he should come to live under your roof with Virginia.  The\ncreature has been madly infatuated with her ever since the day he took\nher from Number One, and you have encouraged his infatuation until\nyesterday.  Then you regained your sanity and put him in his rightful\nplace.  What is the result?  Denied the easy prey he expected he\nimmediately decided to take it by force, and with that end in view, and\ntaking advantage of the series of remarkable circumstances which played\ninto his hands, he liberated his fellows, and with them hastened to the\nbeach in search of Virginia and in hopes of being able to fly with her\nupon the Ithaca.  There he met the Malay pirates, and together they\nformed an alliance under terms of which Number Thirteen is to have the\ngirl, and the pirates the chest in return for transporting him and his\ncrew to Borneo.  Why it is all perfectly simple and logical, Professor\nMaxon; do you not see it now?\"\n\n\"You may be right, doctor,\" answered the old man.  \"But it is idle to\nconjecture.  Tomorrow we can be up and doing, so let us get what sleep\nwe can tonight.  We shall need all our energies if we are to save my\npoor, dear girl, from the clutches of that horrid, soulless thing.\"\n\n\nAt the very moment that he spoke the object of his contumely was\nentering the dark mouth of a broad river that flowed from out of the\nheart of savage Borneo.  In the prahu with him his eleven hideous\ncompanions now bent to their paddles with slightly increased\nefficiency.  Before them the leader saw a fire blazing upon a tiny\nisland in the center of the stream.  Toward this they turned their\nsilent way.  Grimly the war prahu with its frightful freight nosed\ncloser to the bank.\n\nAt last Number Thirteen made out the figures of men about the fire, and\nas they came still closer he was sure that they were members of the\nvery party he had been pursuing across the broad waters for hours.  The\nprahus were drawn up upon the bank and the warriors were preparing to\neat.\n\nJust as the young giants' prahu came within the circle of firelight a\nswarthy Malay approached the fire, dragging a white girl roughly by the\narm.  No more was needed to convince Number Thirteen of the identity of\nthe party.  With a low command to his fellows he urged them to\nredoubled speed.  At the same instant a Dyak warrior caught sight of\nthe approaching boat as it sped into the full glare of the light.\n\nAt sight of the occupants the head hunters scattered for their own\nprahus.  The frightful aspect of the enemy turned their savage hearts\nto water, leaving no fight in their ordinarily warlike souls.\n\nSo quickly they moved that as the pursuing prahu touched the bank all\nthe nearer boats had been launched, and the remaining pirates were\nscurrying across the little island for those which lay upon the\nopposite side.  Among these was the Malay who guarded the girl, but he\nhad not been quick enough to prevent Virginia Maxon recognizing the\nstalwart figure standing in the bow of the oncoming craft.\n\nAs he dragged her away toward the prahu of Muda Saffir she cried out to\nthe strange white man who seemed her self-appointed protector.\n\n\"Help!  Help!\" she called.  \"This way!  Across the island!\" And then\nthe brown hand of her jailer closed over her mouth.  Like a tigress she\nfought to free herself, or to detain her captor until the rescue party\nshould catch up with them, but the scoundrel was muscled like a bull,\nand when the girl held back he lifted her across his shoulder and broke\ninto a run.\n\nRajah Muda Saffir had no stomach for a fight himself, but he was loathe\nto lose the prize he had but just won, and seeing that his men were\npanic-stricken he saw no alternative but to rally them for a brief\nstand that would give the little moment required to slip away in his\nown prahu with the girl.\n\nCalling aloud for those around him to come to his support he halted\nfifty yards from his boat just as Number Thirteen with his fierce,\nbrainless horde swept up from the opposite side of the island in the\nwake of him who bore Virginia Maxon.  The old rajah succeeded in\ngathering some fifty warriors about him from the crews of the two boats\nwhich lay near his.  His own men he hastened to their posts in his\nprahu that they might be ready to pull swiftly away the moment that he\nand the captive were aboard.\n\nThe Dyak warriors presented an awe inspiring spectacle in the fitful\nlight of the nearby camp fire.  The ferocity of their fierce faces was\naccentuated by the upturned, bristling tiger cat's teeth which\nprotruded from every ear; while the long feathers of the Argus pheasant\nwaving from their war-caps, the brilliant colors of their war-coats\ntrimmed with the black and white feathers of the hornbill, and the\nstrange devices upon their gaudy shields but added to the savagery of\ntheir appearance as they danced and howled, menacing and intimidating,\nin the path of the charging foe.\n\nA single backward glance was all that Virginia Maxon found it possible\nto throw in the direction of the rescue party, and in that she saw a\nsight that lived forever in her memory.  At the head of his hideous,\nmisshapen pack sprang the stalwart young giant straight into the heart\nof the flashing parangs of the howling savages.  To right and left fell\nthe mighty bull whip cutting down men with all the force and dispatch\nof a steel saber.  The Dyaks, encouraged by the presence of Muda Saffir\nin their rear, held their ground; and the infuriated, brainless things\nthat followed the wielder of the bull whip threw themselves upon the\nhead hunters with beating hands and rending fangs.\n\nNumber Ten wrested a parang from an adversary, and acting upon his\nexample the other creatures were not long in arming themselves in a\nsimilar manner.  Cutting and jabbing they hewed their way through the\nsolid ranks of the enemy, until Muda Saffir, seeing that defeat was\ninevitable turned and fled toward his prahu.\n\nFour of his creatures lay dead as the last of the Dyaks turned to\nescape from the mad white man who faced naked steel with only a rawhide\nwhip.  In panic the head hunters made a wild dash for the two remaining\nprahus, for Muda Saffir had succeeded in getting away from the island\nin safety.\n\nNumber Thirteen reached the water's edge but a moment after the prow of\nthe rajah's craft had cleared the shore and was swinging up stream\nunder the vigorous strokes of its fifty oarsmen.  For an instant he\nstood poised upon the bank as though to spring after the retreating\nprahu, but the knowledge that he could not swim held him back--it was\nuseless to throw away his life when the need of it was so great if\nVirginia Maxon was to be saved.\n\nTurning to the other prahus he saw that one was already launched, but\nthat the crew of the other was engaged in a desperate battle with the\nseven remaining members of his crew for possession of the boat.\nLeaping among the combatants he urged his fellows aboard the prahu\nwhich was already half filled with Dyaks.  Then he shoved the boat out\ninto the river, jumping aboard himself as its prow cleared the gravelly\nbeach.\n\nFor several minutes that long, hollowed log was a veritable floating\nhell of savage, screaming men locked in deadly battle.  The sharp\nparangs of the head hunters were no match for the superhuman muscles of\nthe creatures that battered them about; now lifting one high above his\nfellows and using the body as a club to beat down those nearby; again\nsnapping an arm or leg as one might break a pipe stem; or hurling a\nliving antagonist headlong above the heads of his fellows to the dark\nwaters of the river.  And above them all in the thickest of the fight,\ntowering even above his own giants, rose the mighty figure of the\nterrible white man, whose very presence wrought havoc with the valor of\nthe brown warriors.\n\nTwo more of Number Thirteen's creatures had been cut down in the prahu,\nbut the loss among the Dyaks had been infinitely greater, and to it was\nnow added the desertions of the terror stricken savages who seemed to\nfear the frightful countenances of their adversaries even as much as\nthey did their prowess.\n\nThere remained but a handful of brown warriors in one end of the boat\nwhen the advantage of utilizing their knowledge of the river and of\nnavigation occurred to Number Thirteen.  Calling to his men he\ncommanded them to cease killing, making prisoners of those who remained\ninstead.  So accustomed had his pack now become to receiving and acting\nupon his orders that they changed their tactics immediately, and one by\none the remaining Dyaks were overpowered, disarmed and held.\n\nWith difficulty Number Thirteen communicated with them, for among them\nthere was but a single warrior who had ever had intercourse with an\nEnglishman, but at last by means of signs and the few words that were\ncommon to them both he made the native understand that he would spare\nthe lives of himself and his companions if they would help him in\npursuit of Muda Saffir and the girl.\n\nThe Dyaks felt but little loyalty for the rascally Malay they served,\nsince in common with all their kind they and theirs had suffered for\ngenerations at the hands of the cruel, crafty and unscrupulous race\nthat had usurped the administration of their land.  So it was not\ndifficult to secure from them the promise of assistance in return for\ntheir lives.\n\nNumber Thirteen noticed that when they addressed him it was always as\nBulan, and upon questioning them he discovered that they had given him\nthis title of honor partly in view of his wonderful fighting ability\nand partly because the sight of his white face emerging from out of the\ndarkness of the river into the firelight of their blazing camp fire had\ncarried to their impressionable minds a suggestion of the tropic moon\nwhich they admired and reverenced.  Both the name and the idea appealed\nto Number Thirteen and from that time he adopted Bulan as his rightful\ncognomen.\n\nThe loss of time resulting from the fight in the prahu and the ensuing\npeace parley permitted Muda Saffir to put considerable distance between\nhimself and his pursuers.  The Malay's boat was now alone, for of the\neight prahus that remained of the original fleet it was the only one\nwhich had taken this branch of the river, the others having scurried\ninto a smaller southerly arm after the fight upon the island, that they\nmight the more easily escape their hideous foemen.\n\nOnly Barunda, the headman, knew which channel Rajah Muda Saffir\nintended following, and Muda wondered why it was that the two boats\nthat were to have borne Barunda's men did not catch up with his.  While\nhe had left Barunda and his warriors engaged in battle with the\nstrangers he did not for an instant imagine that they would suffer any\nsevere loss, and that one of their boats should be captured was beyond\nbelief.  But this was precisely what had happened, and the second boat,\nseeing the direction taken by the enemy, had turned down stream the\nmore surely to escape them.\n\nSo it was that while Rajah Muda Saffir moved leisurely up the river\ntoward his distant stronghold waiting for the other boats of his fleet\nto overtake him, Barunda, the headman, guided the white enemy swiftly\nafter him.  Barunda had discovered that it was the girl alone this\nwhite man wanted.  Evidently he either knew nothing of the treasure\nchest lying in the bottom of Muda Saffir's boat, or, knowing, was\nindifferent.  In either event Barunda thought that he saw a chance to\npossess himself of the rich contents of the heavy box, and so served\nhis new master with much greater enthusiasm than he had the old.\n\nBeneath the paddles of the natives and the five remaining members of\nhis pack Bulan sped up the dark river after the single prahu with its\npriceless freight.  Already six of the creatures of Professor Maxon's\nexperiments had given up their lives in the service of his daughter,\nand the remaining six were pushing forward through the inky blackness\nof the jungle night into the untracked heart of savage Borneo to rescue\nher from her abductors though they sacrificed their own lives in the\nendeavor.\n\nFar ahead of them in the bottom of the great prahu crouched the girl\nthey sought.  Her thoughts were of the man she felt intuitively to\npossess the strength, endurance and ability to overcome every obstacle\nand reach her at last.  Would he come in time?  Ah, that was the\nquestion.  The mystery of the stranger appealed to her.  A thousand\ntimes she had attempted to solve the question of his first appearance\non the island at the very moment that his mighty muscles were needed to\nrescue her from the horrible creature of her father's creation.  Then\nthere was his unaccountable disappearance for weeks; there was von\nHorn's strange reticence and seeming ignorance as to the circumstances\nwhich brought the young man to the island, or his equally unaccountable\ndisappearance after having rescued her from Number One.  And now, when\nshe suddenly found herself in need of protection, here was the same\nyoung man turning up in a most miraculous fashion, and at the head of\nthe terrible creatures of the inner campong.\n\nThe riddle was too deep for her--she could not solve it; and then her\nthoughts were interrupted by the thin, brown hand of Rajah Muda Saffir\nas it encircled her waist and drew her toward him.  Upon the evil lips\nwere hot words of passion.  The girl wrenched herself from the man's\nembrace, and, with a little scream of terror, sprang to her feet, and\nas Muda Saffir arose to grasp her again she struck him full in the face\nwith one small, clenched fist.\n\nDirectly behind the Malay lay the heavy chest of Professor Maxon.  As\nthe man stepped backward to recover his equilibrium both feet struck\nthe obstacle.  For an instant he tottered with wildly waving arms in an\nendeavor to regain his lost balance, then, with a curse upon his lips,\nhe lunged across the box and over the side of the prahu into the dark\nwaters of the river.\n\n\n\n10\n\nDESPERATE CHANCE\n\n\nThe great chest in the bottom of Rajah Muda Saffir's prahu had awakened\nin other hearts as well as his, blind greed and avarice; so that as it\nhad been the indirect cause of his disaster it now proved the incentive\nto another to turn the mishap to his own profit, and to the final\nundoing of the Malay.\n\nThe panglima Ninaka of the Signana Dyaks who manned Muda Saffir's war\nprahu saw his chief disappear beneath the swift waters of the river,\nbut the word of command that would have sent the boat hurriedly back to\npick up the swimmer was not given.  Instead a lusty cry for greater\nspeed ahead urged the sinuous muscles gliding beneath the sleek brown\nhides; and when Muda Saffir rose to the surface with a cry for help\nupon his lips Ninaka shouted back to him in derision, consigning his\ncarcass to the belly of the nearest crocodile.\n\nIn futile rage Muda Saffir called down the most terrible curses of\nAllah and his Prophet upon the head of Ninaka and his progeny to the\nfifth generation, and upon the shades of his forefathers, and upon the\ngrim skulls which hung from the rafters of his long-house.  Then he\nturned and swam rapidly toward the shore.\n\nNinaka, now in possession of both the chest and the girl, was rich\nindeed, but with Muda Saffir dead he scarce knew to whom he could\ndispose of the white girl for a price that would make it worth while to\nbe burdened with the danger and responsibility of retaining her.  He\nhad had some experience of white men in the past and knew that dire\nwere the punishments meted to those who wronged the white man's women.\nAll through the remainder of the long night Ninaka pondered the\nquestion deeply.  At last he turned to Virginia.\n\n\"Why does the big white man who leads the ourang outangs follow us?\" he\nasked.  \"Is it the chest he desires, or you?\"\n\n\"It is certainly not the chest,\" replied the girl.  \"He wishes to take\nme back to my father, that is all.  If you will return me to him you\nmay keep the chest, if that is what you wish.\"\n\nNinaka looked at her quizzically for a moment.  Evidently then she was\nof some value.  Possibly should he retain her he could wring a handsome\nransom from the white man.  He would wait and see, it were always an\neasy matter to rid himself of her should circumstances require.  The\nriver was there, deep, dark and silent, and he could place the\nresponsibility for her loss upon Muda Saffir.\n\nShortly after day break Ninaka beached his prahu before the long-house\nof a peaceful river tribe.  The chest he hid in the underbrush close by\nhis boat, and with the girl ascended the notched log that led to the\nverandah of the structure, which, stretching away for three hundred\nyards upon its tall piles, resembled a huge centipede.\n\nThe dwellers in the long-house extended every courtesy to Ninaka and\nhis crew.  At the former's request Virginia was hidden away in a dark\nsleeping closet in one of the windowless living rooms which opened\nalong the verandah for the full length of the house.  Here a native\ngirl brought her food and water, sitting, while she ate, in rapt\ncontemplation of the white skin and golden hair of the strange female.\n\nAt about the time that Ninaka pulled his prahu upon the beach before\nthe long-house, Muda Saffir from the safety of the concealing\nunderbrush upon the shore saw a familiar war prahu forging rapidly up\nthe stream.  As it approached him he was about to call aloud to those\nwho manned it, for in the bow he saw a number of his own men; but a\nsecond glance as the boat came opposite him caused him to alter his\nintention and drop further into the engulfing verdure, for behind his\nmen squatted five of the terrible monsters that had wrought such havoc\nwith his expedition, and in the stern he saw his own Barunda in\nfriendly converse with the mad white man who had led them.\n\nAs the boat disappeared about a bend in the river Rajah Muda Saffir\narose, shaking his fist in the direction it had vanished and, cursing\nanew and volubly, damned each separate hair in the heads of the\nfaithless Barunda and the traitorous Ninaka.  Then he resumed his watch\nfor the friendly prahu, or smaller sampan which he knew time would\neventually bring from up or down the river to his rescue, for who of\nthe surrounding natives would dare refuse succor to the powerful Rajah\nof Sakkan!\n\nAt the long-house which harbored Ninaka and his crew, Barunda and Bulan\nstopped with theirs to obtain food and rest.  The quick eye of the Dyak\nchieftain recognized the prahu of Rajah Muda Saffir where it lay upon\nthe beach, but he said nothing to his white companion of what it\naugured--it might be well to discover how the land lay before he\ncommitted himself too deeply to either faction.\n\nAt the top of the notched log he was met by Ninaka, who, with\nhorror-wide eyes, looked down upon the fearsome monstrosities that\nlumbered awkwardly up the rude ladder in the wake of the agile Dyaks\nand the young white giant.\n\n\"What does it mean?\" whispered the panglima to Barunda.\n\n\"These are now my friends,\" replied Barunda.  \"Where is Muda Saffir?\"\n\nNinaka jerked his thumb toward the river.  \"Some crocodile has feasted\nwell,\" he said significantly.  Barunda smiled.\n\n\"And the girl?\" he continued.  \"And the treasure?\"\n\nNinaka's eyes narrowed.  \"They are safe,\" he answered.\n\n\"The white man wants the girl,\" remarked Barunda.  \"He does not suspect\nthat you are one of Muda Saffir's people.  If he guessed that you knew\nthe whereabouts of the girl he would torture the truth from you and\nthen kill you.  He does not care for the treasure.  There is enough in\nthat great chest for two, Ninaka.  Let us be friends.  Together we can\ndivide it; otherwise neither of us will get any of it.  What do you\nsay, Ninaka?\"\n\nThe panglima scowled.  He did not relish the idea of sharing his prize,\nbut he was shrewd enough to realize that Barunda possessed the power to\nrob him of it all, so at last he acquiesced, though with poor grace.\n\nBulan had stood near during this conversation, unable, of course, to\nunderstand a single word of the native tongue.\n\n\"What does the man say?\" he asked Barunda.  \"Has he seen anything of\nthe prahu bearing the girl?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the Dyak.  \"He says that two hours ago such a war prahu\npassed on its way up river--he saw the white girl plainly.  Also he\nknows whither they are bound, and how, by crossing through the jungle\non foot, you may intercept them at their next stop.\"\n\nBulan, suspecting no treachery, was all anxiety to be off at once.\nBarunda suggested that in case of some possible emergency causing the\nquarry to return down the river it would be well to have a force remain\nat the long-house to intercept them.  He volunteered to undertake the\ncommand of this party.  Ninaka, he said, would furnish guides to escort\nBulan and his men through the jungle to the point at which they might\nexpect to find Muda Saffir.\n\nAnd so, with the girl he sought lying within fifty feet of him, Bulan\nstarted off through the jungle with two of Ninaka's Dyaks as\nguides--guides who had been well instructed by their panglima as to\ntheir duties.  Twisting and turning through the dense maze of\nunderbrush and close-growing, lofty trees the little party of eight\nplunged farther and farther into the bewildering labyrinth.\n\nFor hours the tiresome march was continued, until at last the guides\nhalted, apparently to consult each other as to the proper direction.\nBy signs they made known to Bulan that they did not agree upon the\nright course to pursue from there on, and that they had decided that it\nwould be best for each to advance a little way in the direction he\nthought the right one while Bulan and his five creatures remained where\nthey were.\n\n\"We will go but a little way,\" said the spokesman, \"and then we shall\nreturn and lead you in the proper direction.\"\n\nBulan saw no harm in this, and without a shade of suspicion sat down\nupon a fallen tree and watched his two guides disappear into the jungle\nin opposite directions.  Once out of sight of the white man the two\nturned back and met a short distance in the rear of the party they had\ndeserted--in another moment they were headed for the long-house from\nwhich they had started.\n\nIt was fully an hour thereafter that doubts began to enter Bulan's\nhead, and as the day dragged on he came to realize that he and his\nweird pack were alone and lost in the heart of a strange and tangled\nweb of tropical jungle.\n\nNo sooner had Bulan and his party disappeared in the jungle than\nBarunda and Ninaka made haste to embark with the chest and the girl and\npush rapidly on up the river toward the wild and inaccessible regions\nof the interior.  Virginia Maxon's strong hope of succor had been\ngradually waning as no sign of the rescue party appeared as the day\nwore on.  Somewhere behind her upon the broad river she was sure a\nlong, narrow native prahu was being urged forward in pursuit, and that\nin command of it was the young giant who was now never for a moment\nabsent from her thoughts.\n\nFor hours she strained her eyes over the stern of the craft that was\nbearing her deeper and deeper into the wild heart of fierce Borneo.  On\neither shore they occasionally passed a native long-house, and the girl\ncould not help but wonder at the quiet and peace which reigned over\nthese little settlements.  It was as though they were passing along a\nbeaten highway in the center of a civilized community; and yet she knew\nthat the men who lolled upon the verandahs, puffing indolently upon\ntheir cigarettes or chewing betel nut, were all head hunters, and that\nalong the verandah rafters above them hung the grisly trophies of their\nprowess.\n\nYet as she glanced from them to her new captors she could not but feel\nthat she would prefer captivity in one of the settlements they were\npassing--there at least she might find an opportunity to communicate\nwith her father, or be discovered by the rescue party as it came up the\nriver.  The idea grew upon her as the day advanced until she spent the\ntime in watching furtively for some means of escape should they but\ntouch the shore momentarily; and though they halted twice her captors\nwere too watchful to permit her the slightest opportunity for putting\nher plan into action.\n\nBarunda and Ninaka urged their men on, with brief rests, all day, nor\ndid they halt even after night had closed down upon the river.  On, on\nthe swift prahu sped up the winding channel which had now dwindled to a\nnarrow stream, at intervals rushing strongly between rocky walls with a\ncurrent that tested the strength of the strong, brown paddlers.\n\nLong-houses had become more and more infrequent until for some time now\nno sign of human habitation had been visible.  The jungle undergrowth\nwas scantier and the spaces between the boles of the forest trees more\nopen.  Virginia Maxon was almost frantic with despair as the utter\nhelplessness of her position grew upon her.  Each stroke of those\nslender paddles was driving her farther and farther from friends, or\nthe possibility of rescue.  Night had fallen, dark and impenetrable,\nand with it had come the haunting fears that creep in when the sun has\ndeserted his guardian post.\n\nBarunda and Ninaka were whispering together in low gutturals, and to\nthe girl's distorted and fear excited imagination it seemed possible\nthat she alone must be the subject of their plotting.  The prahu was\ngliding through a stretch of comparatively quiet and placid water where\nthe stream spread out into a little basin just above a narrow gorge\nthrough which they had just forced their way by dint of the most\nlaborious exertions on the part of the crew.\n\nVirginia watched the two men near her furtively.  They were deeply\nengrossed in their conversation.  Neither was looking in her direction.\nThe backs of the paddlers were all toward her.  Stealthily she rose to\na stooping position at the boat's side.  For a moment she paused, and\nthen, almost noiselessly, dove overboard and disappeared beneath the\nblack waters.\n\nIt was the slight rocking of the prahu that caused Barunda to look\nsuddenly about to discover the reason for the disturbance.  For a\nmoment neither of the men apprehended the girl's absence.  Ninaka was\nthe first to do so, and it was he who called loudly to the paddlers to\nbring the boat to a stop.  Then they dropped down the river with the\ncurrent, and paddled about above the gorge for half an hour.\n\nThe moment that Virginia Maxon felt the waters close above her head she\nstruck out beneath the surface for the shore upon the opposite side to\nthat toward which she had dived into the river.  She knew that if any\nhad seen her leave the prahu they would naturally expect to intercept\nher on her way toward the nearest shore, and so she took this means of\noutwitting them, although it meant nearly double the distance to be\ncovered.\n\nAfter swimming a short distance beneath the surface the girl rose and\nlooked about her.  Up the river a few yards she caught the\nphosphorescent gleam of water upon the prahu's paddles as they brought\nher to a sudden stop in obedience to Ninaka's command.  Then she saw\nthe dark mass of the war-craft drifting down toward her.\n\nAgain she dove and with strong strokes headed for the shore.  The next\ntime that she rose she was terrified to see the prahu looming close\nbehind her.  The paddlers were propelling the boat slowly in her\ndirection--it was almost upon her now--there was a shout from a man in\nthe bow--she had been seen.\n\nLike a flash she dove once more and, turning, struck out rapidly\nstraight back beneath the oncoming boat.  When she came to the surface\nagain it was to find herself as far from shore as she had been when she\nfirst quitted the prahu, but the craft was now circling far below her,\nand she set out once again to retrace her way toward the inky mass of\nshore line which loomed apparently near and yet, as she knew, was some\nconsiderable distance from her.\n\nAs she swam, her mind, filled with the terrors of the night, conjured\nrecollection of the stories she had heard of the fierce crocodiles\nwhich infest certain of the rivers of Borneo.  Again and again she\ncould have sworn that she felt some huge, slimy body sweep beneath her\nin the mysterious waters of this unknown river.\n\nBehind her she saw the prahu turn back up stream, but now her mind was\nsuddenly engaged with a new danger, for the girl realized that the\nstrong current was bearing her down stream more rapidly than she had\nimagined.  Already she could hear the increasing roar of the river as\nit rushed, wild and tumultuous, through the entrance to the narrow\ngorge below her.  How far it was to shore she could not guess, or how\nfar to the certain death of the swirling waters toward which she was\nbeing drawn by an irresistible force; but of one thing she was certain,\nher strength was rapidly waning, and she must reach the bank quickly.\n\nWith redoubled energy she struck out in one last mighty effort to reach\nthe shore.  The tug of the current was strong upon her, like a giant\nhand reaching up out of the cruel river to bear her back to death.  She\nfelt her strength ebbing quickly--her strokes now were feeble and\nfutile.  With a prayer to her Maker she threw her hands above her head\nin the last effort of the drowning swimmer to clutch at even thin air\nfor support--the current caught and swirled her downward toward the\ngorge, and, at the same instant her fingers touched and closed upon\nsomething which swung low above the water.\n\nWith the last flickering spark of vitality that remained in her poor,\nexhausted body Virginia Maxon clung to the frail support that a kind\nProvidence had thrust into her hands.  How long she hung there she\nnever knew, but finally a little strength returned to her, and\npresently she realized that it was a pendant creeper hanging low from a\njungle tree upon the bank that had saved her from the river's rapacious\nmaw.\n\nInch by inch she worked herself upward toward the bank, and at last,\nweak and panting, sunk exhausted to the cool carpet of grass that grew\nto the water's edge.  Almost immediately tired, Nature plunged her into\na deep sleep.  It was daylight when she awoke, dreaming that the tall\nyoung giant had rescued her from a band of demons and was lifting her\nin his arms to carry her back to her father.\n\nThrough half open lids she saw the sunlight filtering through the leafy\ncanopy above her--she wondered at the realism of her dream; full\nconsciousness returned and with it the conviction that she was in truth\nbeing held close by strong arms against a bosom that throbbed to the\nbeating of a real heart.\n\nWith a sudden start she opened her eyes wide to look up into the\nhideous face of a giant ourang outang.\n\n\n\n11\n\n\"I AM COMING!\"\n\n\nThe morning following the capture of Virginia Maxon by Muda Saffir,\nProfessor Maxon, von Horn, Sing Lee and the sole surviving lascar from\nthe crew of the Ithaca set out across the strait toward the mainland of\nBorneo in the small boat which the doctor had secreted in the jungle\nnear the harbor.  The party was well equipped with firearms and\nammunition, and the bottom of the boat was packed full with provisions\nand cooking utensils.  Von Horn had been careful to see that the boat\nwas furnished with a mast and sail, and now, under a good breeze the\nparty was making excellent time toward the mysterious land of their\ndestination.\n\nThey had scarcely cleared the harbor when they sighted a ship far out\nacross the strait.  Its erratic movements riveted their attention upon\nit, and later, as they drew nearer, they perceived that the strange\ncraft was a good sized schooner with but a single short mast and tiny\nsail.  For a minute or two her sail would belly with the wind and the\nvessel make headway, then she would come suddenly about, only to repeat\nthe same tactics a moment later.  She sailed first this way and then\nthat, losing one minute what she had gained the minute before.\n\nVon Horn was the first to recognize her.\n\n\"It is the Ithaca,\" he said, \"and her Dyak crew are having a devil of a\ntime managing her--she acts as though she were rudderless.\"\n\nVon Horn ran the small boat within hailing distance of the dismasted\nhulk whose side was now lined with waving, gesticulating natives.  They\nwere peaceful fishermen, they explained, whose prahus had been wrecked\nin the recent typhoon.  They had barely escaped with their lives by\nclambering aboard this wreck which Allah had been so merciful as to\nplace directly in their road.  Would the Tuan Besar be so good as to\ntell them how to make the big prahu steer?\n\nVon Horn promised to help them on condition that they would guide him\nand his party to the stronghold of Rajah Muda Saffir in the heart of\nBorneo.  The Dyaks willingly agreed, and von Horn worked his small boat\nin close under the Ithaca's stern.  Here he found that the rudder had\nbeen all but unshipped, probably as the vessel was lifted over the reef\nduring the storm, but a single pintle remaining in its gudgeon.  A half\nhour's work was sufficient to repair the damage, and then the two boats\ncontinued their journey toward the mouth of the river up which those\nthey sought had passed the night before.\n\nInside the river's mouth an anchorage was found for the Ithaca near the\nvery island upon which the fierce battle between Number Thirteen and\nMuda Saffir's forces had occurred.  From the deck of the larger vessel\nthe deserted prahu which had borne Bulan across the strait was visible,\nas were the bodies of the slain Dyaks and the misshapen creatures of\nthe white giant's forces.\n\nIn excited tones the head hunters called von Horn's attention to these\nevidences of conflict, and the doctor drew his boat up to the island\nand leaped ashore, followed by Professor Maxon and Sing.  Here they\nfound the dead bodies of the four monsters who had fallen in an attempt\nto rescue their creator's daughter, though little did any there imagine\nthe real truth.\n\nAbout the corpses of the four were the bodies of a dozen Dyak warriors\nattesting to the ferocity of the encounter and the savage prowess of\nthe unarmed creatures who had sold their poor lives so dearly.\n\n\"Evidently they fell out about the possession of the captive,\"\nsuggested von Horn.  \"Let us hope that she did not fall into the\nclutches of Number Thirteen--any fate would be better than that.\"\n\n\"God give that that has not befallen her,\" moaned Professor Maxon.\n\"The pirates might but hold her for ransom, but should that soulless\nfiend possess her my prayer is that she found the strength and the\nmeans to take her own life before he had an opportunity to have his way\nwith her.\"\n\n\"Amen,\" agreed von Horn.\n\nSing Lee said nothing, but in his heart he hoped that Virginia Maxon\nwas not in the power of Rajah Muda Saffir.  The brief experience he had\nhad with Number Thirteen during the fight in the bungalow had rather\nwarmed his wrinkled old heart toward the friendless young giant, and he\nwas a sufficiently good judge of human nature to be confident that the\ngirl would be comparatively safe in his keeping.\n\nIt was quickly decided to abandon the small boat and embark the entire\nparty in the deserted war prahu.  A half hour later saw the strangely\nmixed expedition forging up the river, but not until von Horn had\nboarded the Ithaca and discovered to his dismay that the chest was not\non board her.\n\nFar above them on the right bank Muda Saffir still squatted in his\nhiding place, for no friendly prahu or sampan had passed his way since\ndawn.  His keen eyes roving constantly up and down the long stretch of\nriver that was visible from his position finally sighted a war prahu\ncoming toward him from down stream.  As it drew closer he recognized it\nas one which had belonged to his own fleet before his unhappy encounter\nwith the wild white man and his abhorrent pack, and a moment later his\nheart leaped as he saw the familiar faces of several of his men; but\nwho were the strangers in the stern, and what was a Chinaman doing\nperched there upon the bow?\n\nThe prahu was nearly opposite him before he recognized Professor Maxon\nand von Horn as the white men of the little island.  He wondered how\nmuch they knew of his part in the raid upon their encampment.\nBududreen had told him much concerning the doctor, and as Muda Saffir\nrecalled the fact that von Horn was anxious to possess himself of both\nthe treasure and the girl he guessed that he would be safe in the man's\nhands so long as he could hold out promises of turning one or the other\nover to him; and so, as he was tired of squatting upon the\nuncomfortable bank and was very hungry, he arose and hailed the passing\nprahu.\n\nHis men recognized his voice immediately and as they knew nothing of\nthe defection of any of their fellows, turned the boat's prow toward\nshore without waiting for the command from von Horn.  The latter,\nfearing treachery, sprang to his feet with raised rifle, but when one\nof the paddlers explained that it was the Rajah Muda Saffir who hailed\nthem and that he was alone von Horn permitted them to draw nearer the\nshore, though he continued to stand ready to thwart any attempted\ntreachery and warned both the professor and Sing to be on guard.\n\nAs the prahu's nose touched the bank Muda Saffir stepped aboard and\nwith many protestations of gratitude explained that he had fallen\noverboard from his own prahu the night before and that evidently his\nfollowers thought him drowned, since none of his boats had returned to\nsearch for him.  Scarcely had the Malay seated himself before von Horn\nbegan questioning him in the rajah's native tongue, not a word of which\nwas intelligible to Professor Maxon.  Sing, however, was as familiar\nwith it as was von Horn.\n\n\"Where are the girl and the treasure?\" he asked.\n\n\"What girl, Tuan Besar?\" inquired the wily Malay innocently.  \"And what\ntreasure?  The white man speaks in riddles.\"\n\n\"Come, come,\" cried von Horn impatiently.  \"Let us have no foolishness.\nYou know perfectly well what I mean--it will go far better with you if\nwe work together as friends.  I want the girl--if she is unharmed--and\nI will divide the treasure with you if you will help me to obtain them;\notherwise you shall have no part of either.  What do you say?  Shall we\nbe friends or enemies?\"\n\n\"The girl and the treasure were both stolen from me by a rascally\npanglima, Ninaka,\" said Muda Saffir, seeing that it would be as well to\nsimulate friendship for the white man for the time being at\nleast--there would always be an opportunity to use a kris upon him in\nthe remote fastness of the interior to which Muda Saffir would lead\nthem.\n\n\"What became of the white man who led the strange monsters?\" asked von\nHorn.\n\n\"He killed many of my men, and the last I saw of him he was pushing up\nthe river after the girl and the treasure,\" replied the Malay.\n\n\"If another should ask you,\" continued von Horn with a meaningful\nglance toward Professor Maxon, \"it will be well to say that the girl\nwas stolen by this white giant and that you suffered defeat in an\nattempt to rescue her because of your friendship for us.  Do you\nunderstand?\"\n\nMuda Saffir nodded.  Here was a man after his own heart, which loved\nintrigue and duplicity.  Evidently he would be a good ally in wreaking\nvengeance upon the white giant who had caused all his\ndiscomfiture--afterward there was always the kris if the other should\nbecome inconvenient.\n\nAt the long-house at which Barunda and Ninaka had halted, Muda Saffir\nlearned all that had transpired, his informants being the two Dyaks who\nhad led Bulan and his pack into the jungle.  He imparted the\ninformation to von Horn and both men were delighted that thus their\nmost formidable enemy had been disposed of.  It would be but a question\nof time before the inexperienced creatures perished in the dense\nforest--that they ever could retrace their steps to the river was most\nunlikely, and the chances were that one by one they would be dispatched\nby head hunters while they slept.\n\nAgain the party embarked, reinforced by the two Dyaks who were only too\nglad to renew their allegiance to Muda Saffir while he was backed by\nthe guns of the white men.  On and on they paddled up the river,\ngleaning from the dwellers in the various long-houses information of\nthe passing of the two prahus with Barunda, Ninaka, and the white girl.\n\nProfessor Maxon was impatient to hear every detail that von Horn\nobtained from Muda Saffir and the various Dyaks that were interviewed\nat the first long-house and along the stretch of river they covered.\nThe doctor told him that Number Thirteen still had Virginia and was\nfleeing up the river in a swift prahu.  He enlarged upon the valor\nshown by Muda Saffir and his men in their noble attempt to rescue his\ndaughter, and through it all Sing Lee sat with half closed eyes,\napparently oblivious to all that passed before him.  What were the\nworkings of that intricate celestial brain none can say.\n\n\nFar in the interior of the jungle Bulan and his five monsters stumbled\non in an effort to find the river.  Had they known it they were moving\nparallel with the stream, but a few miles from it.  At times it wound\nin wide detours close to the path of the lost creatures, and again it\ncircled far away from them.\n\nAs they travelled they subsisted upon the fruits with which they had\nbecome familiar upon the island of their creation.  They suffered\ngreatly for lack of water, but finally stumbled upon a small stream at\nwhich they filled their parched stomachs.  Here it occurred to Bulan\nthat it would be wise to follow the little river, since they could be\nno more completely lost than they now were no matter where it should\nlead them, and it would at least insure them plenty of fresh water.\n\nAs they proceeded down the bank of the stream it grew in size until\npresently it became a fair sized river, and Bulan had hopes that it\nmight indeed prove the stream that they had ascended from the ocean and\nthat soon he would meet with the prahus and possibly find Virginia\nMaxon herself.  The strenuous march of the six through the jungle had\ntorn their light cotton garments into shreds so that they were all\npractically naked, while their bodies were scratched and bleeding from\ncountless wounds inflicted by sharp thorns and tangled brambles through\nwhich they had forced their way.\n\nBulan still carried his heavy bull whip while his five companions were\narmed with the parangs they had taken from the Dyaks they had\noverpowered upon the island at the mouth of the river.  It was upon\nthis strange and remarkable company that the sharp eyes of a score of\nriver Dyaks peered through the foliage.  The head hunters had been\nengaged in collecting camphor crystals when their quick ears caught the\nnoisy passage of the six while yet at a considerable distance, and with\nready parangs the savages crept stealthily toward the sound of the\nadvancing party.\n\nAt first they were terror stricken at the hideous visages of five of\nthe creatures they beheld, but when they saw how few their numbers, and\nhow poorly armed they were, as well as the awkwardness with which they\ncarried their parangs, denoting their unfamiliarity with the weapons,\nthey took heart and prepared to ambush them.\n\nWhat prizes those terrible heads would be when properly dried and\ndecorated!  The savages fairly trembled in anticipation of the\ncommotion they would cause in the precincts of their long-house when\nthey returned with six such magnificent trophies.\n\nTheir victims came blundering on through the dense jungle to where the\ntwenty sleek brown warriors lay in wait for them.  Bulan was in the\nlead, and close behind him in single file lumbered his awkward crew.\nSuddenly there was a chorus of savage cries close beside him and\nsimultaneously he found himself in the midst of twenty cutting,\nslashing parangs.\n\nLike lightning his bull whip flew into action, and to the astonished\nwarriors it was as though a score of men were upon them in the person\nof this mighty white giant.  Following the example of their leader the\nfive creatures at his back leaped upon the nearest warriors, and though\nthey wielded their parangs awkwardly the superhuman strength back of\ntheir cuts and thrusts sent the already blood stained blades through\nmany a brown body.\n\nThe Dyaks would gladly have retreated after the first surprise of their\ninitial attack, but Bulan urged his men on after them, and so they were\nforced to fight to preserve their lives at all.  At last five of them\nmanaged to escape into the jungle, but fifteen remained quietly upon\nthe earth where they had fallen--the victims of their own over\nconfidence.  Beside them lay two of Bulan's five, so that now the\nlittle party was reduced to four--and the problem that had faced\nProfessor Maxon was so much closer to its own solution.\n\nFrom the bodies of the dead Dyaks Bulan and his three companions,\nNumber Three, Number Ten, and Number Twelve, took enough loin cloths,\ncaps, war-coats, shields and weapons to fit them out completely, after\ndiscarding the ragged remnants of their cotton pajamas, and now, even\nmore terrible in appearance than before, the rapidly vanishing company\nof soulless monsters continued their aimless wandering down the river's\nbrim.\n\nThe five Dyaks who had escaped carried the news of the terrible\ncreatures that had fallen upon them in the jungle, and of the awful\nprowess of the giant white man who led them.  They told of how, armed\nonly with a huge whip, he had been a match and more than a match for\nthe best warriors of the tribe, and the news that they started spread\nrapidly down the river from one long-house to another until it reached\nthe broad stream into which the smaller river flowed, and then it\ntravelled up and down to the headwaters above and the ocean far below\nin the remarkable manner that news travels in the wild places of the\nworld.\n\nSo it was that as Bulan advanced he found the long-houses in his path\ndeserted, and came to the larger river and turned up toward its head\nwithout meeting with resistance or even catching a glimpse of the\nbrown-skinned people who watched him from their hiding places in the\nbrush.\n\nThat night they slept in the long-house near the bank of the greater\nstream, while its rightful occupants made the best of it in the jungle\nbehind.  The next morning found the four again on the march ere the sun\nhad scarcely lighted the dark places of the forest, for Bulan was now\nsure that he was on the right trail and that the new river that he had\ncome to was indeed the same that he had traversed in the Prahu with\nBarunda.\n\nIt must have been close to noon when the young giant's ears caught the\nsound of the movement of some animal in the jungle a short distance to\nhis right and away from the river.  His experience with men had taught\nhim to be wary, for it was evident that every man's hand was against\nhim, so he determined to learn at once whether the noise he heard came\nfrom some human enemy lurking along his trail ready to spring upon him\nwith naked parang at a moment that he was least prepared, or merely\nfrom some jungle brute.\n\nCautiously he threaded his way through the matted vegetation in the\ndirection of the sound.  Although a parang from the body of a\nvanquished Dyak hung at his side he grasped his bull whip ready in his\nright hand, preferring it to the less accustomed weapon of the head\nhunter.  For a dozen yards he advanced without sighting the object of\nhis search, but presently his efforts were rewarded by a glimpse of a\nreddish, hairy body, and a pair of close set, wicked eyes peering at\nhim from behind a giant tree.\n\nAt the same instant a slight movement at one side attracted his\nattention to where another similar figure crouched in the underbrush,\nand then a third, fourth and fifth became evident about him.  Bulan\nlooked in wonderment upon the strange, man-like creatures who eyed him\nthreateningly from every hand.  They stood fully as high as the brown\nDyak warriors, but their bodies were naked except for the growth of\nreddish hair which covered them, shading to black upon the face and\nhands.\n\nThe lips of the nearest were raised in an angry snarl that exposed\nwicked looking fighting fangs, but the beasts did not seem inclined to\ninitiate hostilities, and as they were unarmed and evidently but\nengaged upon their own affairs Bulan decided to withdraw without\narousing them further.  As he turned to retrace his steps he found his\nthree companions gazing in wide-eyed astonishment upon the strange new\ncreatures which confronted them.\n\nNumber Ten was grinning broadly, while Number Three advanced cautiously\ntoward one of the creatures, making a low guttural noise, that could\nonly be interpreted as peaceful and conciliatory--more like a feline\npurr it was than anything else.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" cried Bulan.  \"Leave them alone.  They have not\noffered to harm us.\"\n\n\"They are like us,\" replied Number Three.  \"They must be our own\npeople.  I am going with them.\"\n\n\"And I,\" said Number Ten.\n\n\"And I,\" echoed Number Twelve.  \"At last we have found our own, let us\nall go with them and live with them, far away from the men who would\nbeat us with great whips, and cut us with their sharp swords.\"\n\n\"They are not human beings,\" exclaimed Bulan.  \"We cannot live with\nthem.\"\n\n\"Neither are we human beings,\" retorted Number Twelve.  \"Has not von\nHorn told us so many times?\"\n\n\"If I am not now a human being,\" replied Bulan, \"I intend to be one,\nand so I shall act as a human being should act.  I shall not go to live\nwith savage beasts, nor shall you.  Come with me as I tell you, or you\nshall again taste the bull whip.\"\n\n\"We shall do as we please,\" growled Number Ten, baring his fangs.  \"You\nare not our master.  We have followed you as long as we intend to.  We\nare tired of forever walking, walking, walking through the bushes that\ntear our flesh and hurt us.  Go and be a human being if you think you\ncan, but do not longer interfere with us or we shall kill you,\" and he\nlooked first at Number Three and then at Number Twelve for approval of\nhis ultimatum.\n\nNumber Three nodded his grotesque and hideous head--he was so covered\nwith long black hair that he more nearly resembled an ourang outang\nthan a human being.  Number Twelve looked doubtful.\n\n\"I think Number Ten is right,\" he said at last.  \"We are not human.  We\nhave no souls.  We are things.  And while you, Bulan, are beautiful,\nyet you are as much a soulless thing as we--that much von Horn taught\nus well.  So I believe that it would be better were we to keep forever\nfrom the sight of men.  I do not much like the thought of living with\nthese strange, hairy monsters, but we might find a place here in the\njungle where we could live alone and in peace.\"\n\n\"I do not want to live alone,\" cried Number Three.  \"I want a mate, and\nI see a beautiful one yonder now.  I am going after her,\" and with that\nhe again started toward a female ourang outang; but the lady bared her\nfangs and retreated before his advance.\n\n\"Even the beasts will have none of us,\" cried Number Ten angrily.  \"Let\nus take them by force then,\" and he started after Number Three.\n\n\"Come back!\" shouted Bulan, leaping after the two deserters.\n\nAs he raised his voice there came an answering cry from a little\ndistance ahead--a cry for help, and it was in the agonized tones of a\nwoman's voice.\n\n\"I am coming!\" shouted Bulan, and without another glance at his\nmutinous crew he sprang through the line of menacing ourang outangs.\n\n\n\n12\n\nPERFIDY\n\n\nOn the morning that Bulan set out with his three monsters from the\ndeserted long-house in which they had spent the night, Professor\nMaxon's party was speeding up the river, constantly buoyed with hope by\nthe repeated reports of natives that the white girl had been seen\npassing in a war prahu.\n\nIn translating this information to Professor Maxon, von Horn habitually\nmade it appear that the girl was in the hands of Number Thirteen, or\nBulan, as they had now come to call him owing to the natives' constant\nuse of that name in speaking of the strange, and formidable white giant\nwho had invaded their land.\n\nAt the last long-house below the gorge, the head of which had witnessed\nVirginia Maxon's escape from the clutches of Ninaka and Barunda, the\nsearching party was forced to stop owing to a sudden attack of fever\nwhich had prostrated the professor.  Here they found a woman who had a\nstrange tale to relate of a remarkable sight she had witnessed that\nvery morning.\n\nIt seemed that she had been straining tapioca in a little stream which\nflowed out of the jungle at the rear of the long-house when her\nattention was attracted by the crashing of an animal through the bushes\na few yards above her.  As she looked she saw a huge MIAS PAPPAN cross\nthe stream, bearing in his arms the dead, or unconscious form of a\nwhite-skinned girl with golden hair.\n\nHer description of the MIAS PAPPAN was such as to half convince von\nHorn that she might have seen Number Three carrying Virginia Maxon,\nalthough he could not reconcile the idea with the story that the two\nDyaks had told him of losing all of Bulan's monsters in the jungle.\n\nOf course it was possible that they might have made their way over land\nto this point, but it seemed scarcely credible--and then, how could\nthey have come into possession of Virginia Maxon, whom every report\nexcept this last agreed was still in the hands of Ninaka and Barunda.\nThere was always the possibility that the natives had lied to him, and\nthe more he questioned the Dyak woman the more firmly convinced he\nbecame that this was the fact.\n\nThe outcome of it was that von Horn finally decided to make an attempt\nto follow the trail of the creature that the woman had seen, and with\nthis plan in view persuaded Muda Saffir to arrange with the chief of\nthe long-house at which they then were to furnish him with trackers and\nan escort of warriors, promising them some splendid heads should they\nbe successful in overhauling Bulan and his pack.\n\nProfessor Maxon was too ill to accompany the expedition, and von Horn\nset out alone with his Dyak allies.  For a time after they departed\nSing Lee fretted and fidgeted upon the verandah of the long-house.  He\nwholly distrusted von Horn, and from motives of his own finally decided\nto follow him.  The trail of the party was plainly discernible, and the\nChinaman had no difficulty in following them, so that they had gone no\ngreat way before he came within hearing distance of them.  Always just\nfar enough behind to be out of sight, he kept pace with the little\ncolumn as it marched through the torrid heat of the morning, until a\nlittle after noon he was startled by the sudden cry of a woman in\ndistress, and the answering shout of a man.\n\nThe voices came from a point in the jungle a little to his right and\nbehind him, and without waiting for the column to return, or even to\nascertain if they had heard the cries, Sing ran rapidly in the\ndirection of the alarm.  For a time he saw nothing, but was guided by\nthe snapping of twigs and the rustling of bushes ahead, where the\nauthors of the commotion were evidently moving swiftly through the\njungle.\n\nPresently a strange sight burst upon his astonished vision.  It was the\nhideous Number Three in mad pursuit of a female ourang outang, and an\ninstant later he saw Number Twelve and Number Ten in battle with two\nmales, while beyond he heard the voice of a man shouting encouragement\nto some one as he dashed through the jungle.  It was in this last event\nthat Sing's interest centered, for he was sure that he recognized the\nvoice as that of Bulan, while the first cry for help which he had heard\nhad been in a woman's voice, and Sing knew that its author could be\nnone other than Virginia Maxon.\n\nThose whom he pursued were moving rapidly through the jungle which was\nnow becoming more and more open, but the Chinaman was no mean runner,\nand it was not long before he drew within sight of the object of his\npursuit.\n\nHis first glimpse was of Bulan, running swiftly between two huge bull\nourang outangs that snapped and tore at him as he bounded forward\ncutting and slashing at his foes with his heavy whip.  Just in front of\nthe trio was another bull bearing in his arms the unconscious form of\nVirginia Maxon who had fainted at the first response to her cry for\nhelp.  Sing was armed with a heavy revolver but he dared not attempt to\nuse it for fear that he might wound either Bulan or the girl, and so he\nwas forced to remain but a passive spectator of what ensued.\n\nBulan, notwithstanding the running battle the two bulls were forcing\nupon him, was gaining steadily upon the fleeing ourang outang that was\nhandicapped by the weight of the fair captive he bore in his huge,\nhairy arms.  As they came into a natural clearing in the jungle the\nfleeing bull glanced back to see his pursuer almost upon him, and with\nan angry roar turned to meet the charge.\n\nIn another instant Bulan and the three bulls were rolling and tumbling\nabout the ground, a mass of flying fur and blood from which rose fierce\nand angry roars and growls, while Virginia Maxon lay quietly upon the\nsward where her captor had dropped her.\n\nSing was about to rush forward and pick her up, when he saw von Horn\nand his Dyaks leap into the clearing, to which they had been guided by\nthe sounds of the chase and the encounter.  The doctor halted at the\nsight that met his eyes--the prostrate form of the girl and the man\nbattling with three huge bulls.\n\nThen he gathered up Virginia Maxon, and with a sign to his Dyaks, who\nwere thoroughly frightened at the mere sight of the white giant of whom\nthey had heard such terrible stories, turned and hastened back in the\ndirection from which they had come, leaving the man to what seemed must\nbe a speedy and horrible death.\n\nSing Lee was astounded at the perfidy of the act.  To Bulan alone was\ndue the entire credit of having rescued Professor Maxon's daughter, and\nyet in the very presence of his self-sacrificing loyalty and devotion\nvon Horn had deserted him without making the least attempt to aid him.\nBut the wrinkled old Chinaman was made of different metal, and had\nstarted forward to assist Bulan when a heavy hand suddenly fell upon\nhis shoulder.  Looking around he saw the hideous face of Number Ten\nsnarling into his.  The bloodshot eyes of the monster were flaming with\nrage.  He had been torn and chewed by the bull with which he had\nfought, and though he had finally overcome and killed the beast, a\nfemale which he had pursued had eluded him.  In a frenzy of passion and\nblood lust aroused by his wounds, disappointment and the taste of warm\nblood which still smeared his lips and face, he had been seeking the\nfemale when he suddenly stumbled upon the hapless Sing.\n\nWith a roar he grasped the Chinaman as though to break him in two, but\nSing was not at all inclined to give up his life without a struggle,\nand Number Ten was quick to learn that no mean muscles moved beneath\nthat wrinkled, yellow hide.\n\nThere could, however, have been but one outcome to the unequal struggle\nhad Sing not been armed with a revolver, though it was several seconds\nbefore he could bring it into play upon the great thing that shook and\ntossed him about as though he had been a rat in the mouth of a terrier.\nBut suddenly there was the sharp report of a firearm, and another of\nProfessor Maxon's unhappy experiments sank back into the nothingness\nfrom which he had conjured it.\n\nThen Sing turned his attention to Bulan and his three savage\nassailants, but, except for the dead body of a bull ourang outang upon\nthe spot where he had last seen the four struggling, there was no sign\neither of the white man or his antagonists; nor, though he listened\nattentively, could he catch the slightest sound within the jungle other\nthan the rustling of the leaves and the raucous cries of the brilliant\nbirds that flitted among the gorgeous blooms about him.\n\nFor half an hour he searched in every direction, but finally, fearing\nthat he might become lost in the mazes of the unfamiliar forest he\nreluctantly turned his face toward the river and the long-house that\nsheltered his party.\n\nHere he found Professor Maxon much improved--the safe return of\nVirginia having acted as a tonic upon him.  The girl and her father sat\nwith von Horn upon the verandah of the long-house as Sing clambered up\nthe notched log that led to it from the ground.  At sight of Sing's\nwrinkled old face Virginia Maxon sprang to her feet and ran forward to\ngreet him, for she had been very fond of the shrewd and kindly Chinaman\nof whom she had seen so much during the dreary months of her\nimprisonment within the campong.\n\n\"Oh, Sing,\" she cried, \"where have you been?  We were all so worried to\nthink that no sooner was one of us rescued than another became lost.\"\n\n\"Sing takee walk, Linee, las all,\" said the grinning Chinaman.  \"Velly\nglad see Linee black 'gain,\" and that was all that Sing Lee had to say\nof the adventures through which he had just passed, and the strange\nsights that he had seen.\n\nAgain and again the girl and von Horn narrated the stirring scenes of\nthe day, the latter being compelled to repeat all that had transpired\nfrom the moment that he had heard Virginia's cry, though it was\napparent that he only consented to speak of his part in her rescue\nunder the most considerable urging.  Very pretty modesty, thought Sing\nwhen he had heard the doctor's version of the affair.\n\n\"You see,\" said von Horn, \"when I reached the spot Number Three, the\nbrute that you thought was an ape, had just turned you over to Number\nThirteen, or, as the natives now call him, Bulan.  You were then in a\nfaint, and when I attacked Bulan he dropped you to defend himself.  I\nhad expected a bitter fight from him after the wild tales the natives\nhave been telling of his ferocity, but it was soon evident that he is\nan arrant coward, for I did not even have to fire my revolver--a few\nthumps with the butt of it upon his brainless skull sent him howling\ninto the jungle with his pack at his heels.\"\n\n\"How fortunate it is, my dear doctor,\" said Professor Maxon, \"that you\nwere bright enough to think of trailing the miscreant into the jungle.\nBut for that Virginia would still be in his clutches and by this time\nhe would have been beyond all hope of capture. How can we ever repay\nyou, dear friend?\"\n\n\"That you were generous enough to arrange when we first embarked upon\nthe search for your daughter,\" replied von Horn.\n\n\"Just so, just so,\" said the professor, but a shade of trouble tinged\nthe expression of his face, and a moment later he arose, saying that he\nfelt weak and tired and would go to his sleeping room and lie down for\na while.  The fact was that Professor Maxon regretted the promise he\nhad made von Horn relative to his daughter.\n\nOnce before he had made plans for her marriage only to regret them\nlater; he hoped that he had made no mistake this time, but he realized\nthat it had scarcely been fair to Virginia to promise her to his\nassistant without first obtaining her consent.  Yet a promise was a\npromise, and, again, was it not true that but for von Horn she would\nhave been dead or worse than dead in a short time had she not been\nrescued from the clutches of the soulless Bulan?  Thus did the old man\njustify his action, and clinch the determination that he had before\nreached to compel Virginia to wed von Horn should she, from some\nincomprehensible motive, demur.  Yet he hoped that the girl would make\nit easy, by accepting voluntarily the man who had saved her life.\n\nLeft alone, or as he thought alone, with the girl in the growing\nshadows of the evening, von Horn thought the moment propitious for\nrenewing his suit.  He did not consider the natives squatting about\nthem as of sufficient consequence to consider, since they would not\nunderstand the language in which he addressed Virginia, and in the dusk\nhe failed to note that Sing squatted with the Dyaks, close behind them.\n\n\"Virginia,\" he commenced, after an interval of silence, \"often before\nhave I broached the subject nearest to my heart, yet never have you\ngiven me much encouragement.  Can you not feel for the man who would\ngladly give his life for you, sufficient affection to permit you to\nmake him the happiest man in the world? I do not ask for all your love\nat first--that will come later.  Just give me the right to cherish and\nprotect you.  Say that you will be my wife, Virginia, and we need have\nno more fears that the strange vagaries of your father's mind can ever\nagain jeopardize your life or your happiness as they have in the past.\"\n\n\"I feel that I owe you my life,\" replied the girl in a quiet voice,\n\"and while I am now positive that my father has entirely regained his\nsanity, and looks with as great abhorrence upon the terrible fate he\nplanned for me as I myself, I cannot forget the debt of gratitude which\nbelongs to you.\n\n\"At the same time I do not wish to be the means of making you unhappy,\nas surely would be the result were I to marry you without love.  Let us\nwait until I know myself better.  Though you have spoken to me of the\nmatter before, I realize now that I never have made any effort to\ndetermine whether or not I really can love you.  There is time enough\nbefore we reach civilization, if ever we are fortunate enough to do so\nat all.  Will you not be as generous as you are brave, and give me a\nfew days before I must make you a final answer?\"\n\nWith Professor Maxon's solemn promise to insure his ultimate success\nvon Horn was very gentle and gracious in deferring to the girl's\nwishes.  The girl for her part could not put from her mind the\ndisappointment she had felt when she discovered that her rescuer was\nvon Horn, and not the handsome young giant whom she had been positive\nwas in close pursuit of her abductors.\n\nWhen Number Thirteen had been mentioned she had always pictured him as\na hideous monster, similar to the creature that had seized her in the\njungle beside the encampment that first day she had seen the mysterious\nstranger, of whom she could obtain no information either from her\nfather or von Horn.  When she had recently insisted that the same man\nhad been at the head of her father's creatures in an attempt to rescue\nher, both von Horn and Professor Maxon scoffed at the idea, until at\nlast she was convinced that the fright and the firelight had conspired\nto conjure in her brain the likeness of one who was linked by memory to\nanother time of danger and despair.\n\nVirginia could not understand why it was that the face of the stranger\npersisted in obtruding itself in her memory.  That the man was\nunusually good looking was undeniable, but she had known many good\nlooking men, nor was she especially impressionable to mere superficial\nbeauty.  No words had passed between them on the occasion of their\nfirst meeting, so it could have been nothing that he said which caused\nthe memory of him to cling so tenaciously in her mind.\n\nWhat was it then?  Was it the memory of the moments that she had lain\nin his strong arms--was it the shadow of the sweet, warm glow that had\nsuffused her as his eyes had caught hers upon his face?\n\nThe thing was tantalizing--it was annoying.  The girl blushed in\nmortification at the very thought that she could cling so resolutely to\nthe memory of a total stranger, and--still greater humiliation--long in\nthe secret depths of her soul to see him again.\n\nShe was angry with herself, but the more she tried to forget the young\ngiant who had come into her life for so brief an instant, the more she\nspeculated upon his identity and the strange fate that had brought him\nto their little, savage island only to snatch him away again as\nmysteriously as he had come, the less was the approval with which she\nlooked upon the suit of Doctor von Horn.\n\nVon Horn had left her, and strolled down to the river.  Finally\nVirginia arose to seek the crude couch which had been spread for her in\none of the sleeping rooms of the long-house.  As she passed a group of\nnatives squatted nearby one of the number arose and approached her, and\nas she halted, half in fright, a low voice whispered:\n\n\"Lookee out, Linee, dloctor Hornee velly bad man.\"\n\n\"Why, Sing!\" exclaimed Virginia.  \"What in the world do you mean by\nsaying such a thing as that?\"\n\n\"Never mind, Linee; you always good to old Sing.  Sing no likee see you\nsadee.  Dloctor Hornee velly bad man, las allee,\" and without another\nword the Chinaman turned and walked away.\n\n\n\n13\n\nBURIED TREASURE\n\n\nAfter the escape of the girl Barunda and Ninaka had fallen out over\nthat affair and the division of the treasure, with the result that the\npanglima had slipped a knife between the ribs of his companion and\ndropped the body overboard.\n\nBarunda's followers, however, had been highly enraged at the act, and\nin the ensuing battle which they waged for revenge of their murdered\nchief Ninaka and his crew had been forced to take to the shore and hide\nin the jungle.\n\nWith difficulty they had saved the chest and dragged it after them into\nthe mazes of the underbrush.  Finally, however, they succeeded in\neluding the angry enemy, and took up their march through the interior\nfor the head of a river which would lead them to the sea by another\nroute, it being Ninaka's intention to dispose of the contents of the\nchest as quickly as possible through the assistance of a rascally Malay\nwho dwelt at Gunung Tebor, where he carried on a thriving trade with\npirates.\n\nBut presently it became apparent that he had not so easily escaped the\nfruits of his villainy as he had supposed, for upon the evening of the\nfirst day the rear of his little column was attacked by some of\nBarunda's warriors who had forged ahead of their fellows, with the\nresult that the head of Ninaka's brother went to increase the prestige\nand glory of the house of the enemy.\n\nNinaka was panic-stricken, since he knew that hampered as he was by the\nheavy chest he could neither fight nor run to advantage.  And so, upon\na dark night near the head waters of the river he sought, he buried the\ntreasure at the foot of a mighty buttress tree, and with his parang\nmade certain cabalistic signs upon the bole whereby he might identify\nthe spot when it was safe to return and disinter his booty.  Then, with\nhis men, he hastened down the stream until they reached the head of\nprahu navigation where they stole a craft and paddled swiftly on toward\nthe sea.\n\nWhen the three bull ourang outangs closed upon Bulan he felt no fear as\nto the outcome of the battle, for never in his experience had he coped\nwith any muscles that his own mighty thews could not overcome.  But as\nthe battle continued he realized that there might be a limit to the\nnumber of antagonists which he could successfully withstand, since he\ncould scarcely hope with but two hands to reach the throats of three\nenemies, or ward off the blows and clutches of six powerful hands, or\nthe gnashing of three sets of savage fangs.\n\nWhen the truth dawned upon him that he was being killed the instinct of\nself-preservation was born in him.  The ferocity with which he had\nfought before paled into insignificance beside the mad fury with which\nhe now attacked the three terrible creatures upon him.  Shaking himself\nlike a great lion he freed his arms for a moment from the clinging\nembrace of his foemen, and seizing the neck of the nearest in his\nmighty clutch wrenched the head completely around.\n\nThere was one awful shriek from the tortured brute--the vertebrae\nparted with a snap, and Bulan's antagonists were reduced to two.\nLunging and struggling the three combatants stumbled farther and\nfarther into the jungle beyond the clearing.  With mighty blows the man\nbuffeted the beasts to right and left, but ever they returned in\nbestial rage to renew the encounter.  Bulan was weakening rapidly under\nthe terrific strain to which he had been subjected, and from loss of\nthe blood which flowed from his wounds; yet he was slowly mastering the\nfoaming brutes, who themselves were torn and bleeding and exhausted.\nWeaker and weaker became the struggles of them all, when a sudden\nmisstep sent Bulan stumbling headforemost against the stem of a tree,\nwhere, stunned, he sank unconscious, at the mercy of the relentless\nbulls.\n\nThey had already sprung upon the prostrate form of their victim to\nfinish what the accident had commenced, when the loud report of Sing's\nrevolver smote upon their startled ears as the Chinaman's bullet buried\nitself in the heart of Number Ten.  Never had the ourang outangs heard\nthe sound of a firearm, and the noise, seemingly in such close\nproximity, filled them with such terror that on the instant they forgot\nall else than this new and startling fear, and with headlong haste\nleaped away into the jungle, leaving Bulan lying where he had fallen.\n\nSo it was that though Sing passed within a few paces of the unconscious\nman he neither saw nor heard aught of him or his antagonists.\n\nWhen Bulan returned to consciousness the day was drawing to a close.\nHe was stiff and sore and weak.  His head ached horribly.  He thought\nthat he must indeed be dying, for how could one who suffered so revive?\nBut at last he managed to stagger to his feet, and finally to reach the\nstream along which he had been travelling earlier in the day.  Here he\nquenched his thirst and bathed his wounds, and as darkness came he lay\ndown to sleep upon a bed of matted grasses.\n\nThe next morning found him refreshed and in considerably less pain, for\nthe powers of recuperation which belonged to his perfect health and\nmighty physique had already worked an almost miraculous transformation\nin him.  While he was hunting in the jungle for his breakfast he came\nsuddenly upon Number Three and Number Twelve similarly employed.\n\nAt sight of him the two creatures started to run away, but he called to\nthem reassuringly and they returned.  On closer inspection Bulan saw\nthat both were covered with terrible wounds, and after questioning them\nlearned that they had fared almost as badly at the hands of the ourang\noutangs as had he.\n\n\"Even the beasts loathe us,\" exclaimed Number Twelve.  \"What are we to\ndo?\"\n\n\"Leave the beasts alone, as I told you,\" replied Bulan.\n\n\"Human beings hate us also,\" persisted Number Twelve.\n\n\"Then let us live by ourselves,\" suggested Number Three.\n\n\"We hate each other,\" retorted the pessimistic Number Twelve.  \"There\nis no place for us in the world, and no companionship.  We are but\nsoulless things.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Bulan.  \"I am not a soulless thing.  I am a man, and\nwithin me is as fine and pure a soul as any man may own,\" and to his\nmind's eye came the vision of a fair face surmounted by a mass of\nloosely waving, golden hair; but the brainless ones could not\nunderstand and only shook their heads as they resumed their feeding and\nforgot the subject.\n\nWhen the three had satisfied the cravings of their appetites two of\nthem were for lying down to sleep until it should be time to feed\nagain, but Bulan, once more master, would not permit it, and forced\nthem to accompany him in his seemingly futile search for the girl who\nhad disappeared so mysteriously after he had rescued her from the\nourang outangs.\n\nBoth Number Twelve and Number Three had assured him that the beasts had\nnot recaptured her, for they had seen the entire band flee madly\nthrough the jungle after hearing the report of the single shot which\nhad so terrorized Bulan's antagonists.  Bulan did not know what to make\nof this occurrence which he had not himself heard, the shot having come\nafter he had lost consciousness at the foot of the tree; but from the\ndescription of the noise given him by Number Twelve he felt sure that\nit must have been the report of a gun, and hoped that it betokened the\npresence of Virginia Maxon's friends, and that she was now safe in\ntheir keeping.\n\nNevertheless he did not relinquish his determination to continue his\nsearch for her, since it was quite possible that the gun had been fired\nby a native, many of whom possessed firearms.  His first concern was\nfor the girl's welfare, which spoke eloquently for the chivalry of his\ncharacter, and though he wished to see her for the pleasure that it\nwould give him, the hope of serving her was ever the first\nconsideration in his mind.\n\nHe was now confident that he was following the wrong direction, and\nwith the intention in view of discovering the tracks of the party which\nhad rescued or captured Virginia after he had been forced to relinquish\nher, he set out in a totally new direction away from the river.  His\nsmall woodcraft and little experience in travelling resulted in his\nbecoming completely confused, so that instead of returning to the spot\nwhere he had last seen the girl, as he wished to do, he bore far to the\nnortheast of the place, and missed entirely the path which von Horn and\nhis Dyaks had taken from the long-house into the jungle and back.\n\nAll that day he urged his reluctant companions on through the fearful\nheat of the tropics until, almost exhausted, they halted at dusk upon\nthe bank of a river, where they filled their stomachs with cooling\ndraughts, and after eating lay down to sleep.  It was quite dark when\nBulan was aroused by the sound of something approaching from up the\nriver, and as he lay listening he presently heard the subdued voices of\nmen conversing in whispers.  He recognized the language as that of the\nDyaks, though he could interpret nothing which they said.\n\nPresently he saw a dozen warriors emerge into a little patch of\nmoonlight.  They bore a huge chest among them which they deposited\nwithin a few paces of where Bulan lay.  Then they commenced to dig in\nthe soft earth with their spears and parangs until they had excavated a\nshallow pit.  Into this they lowered the chest, covering it over with\nearth and sprinkling dead grass, twigs and leaves above it, that it\nmight present to a searcher no sign that the ground had recently been\ndisturbed.  The balance of the loose earth which would not go back into\nthe pit was thrown into the river.\n\nWhen all had been made to appear as it was before, one of the warriors\nmade several cuts and scratches upon the stem of a tree which grew\nabove the spot where the chest was buried; then they hastened on in\nsilence past Bulan and down the river.\n\n\nAs von Horn stood by the river's bank after his conversation with\nVirginia, he saw a small sampan approaching from up stream.  In it he\nmade out two natives, and the stealthiness of their approach caused him\nto withdraw into the shadow of a large prahu which was beached close to\nwhere he had been standing.\n\nWhen the men had come close to the landing one of them gave a low\nsignal, and presently a native came down from the long-house.\n\n\"Who is it comes by night?\" he asked.  \"And what want you?\"\n\n\"News has just reached us that Muda Saffir is alive,\" replied one of\nthe men in the boat, \"and that he sleeps this night in your long-house.\nIs it true?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the man on shore.  \"What do you wish of the Rajah Muda\nSaffir?\"\n\n\"We are men of his company and we have news for him,\" returned the\nspeaker in the sampan.  \"Tell him that we must speak to him at once.\"\n\nThe native on shore returned to the long-house without replying.  Von\nHorn wondered what the important news for Muda Saffir might be, and so\nhe remained as he had been, concealed behind the prahu.\n\nPresently the old Malay came down to the water's edge--very warily\nthough--and asked the men whom they might be.  When they had given\ntheir names he seemed relieved.\n\n\"Ninaka,\" they said, \"has murdered Barunda who was taking the rajah's\ntreasure up to the rajah's stronghold--the treasure which Ninaka had\nstolen after trying to murder the rajah and which Barunda had\nrecaptured.  Now Ninaka, after murdering Barunda, set off through the\njungle toward the river which leads to Gunung Tebor, and Barunda's\nuncle followed him with what few men he had with him; but he sent us\ndown river to try and find you, master, and beg of you to come with\nmany men and overtake Ninaka and punish him.\"\n\nMuda Saffir thought for a moment.\n\n\"Hasten back to the uncle of Barunda and tell him that as soon as I can\ngather the warriors I shall come and punish Ninaka.  I have another\ntreasure here which I must not lose, but I can arrange that it will\nstill be here when I return for it, and then Barunda's uncle can come\nback with me to assist me if assistance is needed.  Also, be sure to\ntell Barunda's uncle never to lose sight of the treasure,\" and Muda\nSaffir turned and hastened back to the long-house.\n\nAs the men in the sampan headed the boat's bow up stream again, von\nHorn ran along the jungle trail beside the river and abreast of the\npaddlers.  When he thought that they were out of hearing of the\nlong-house he hailed the two.  In startled surprise the men ceased\npaddling.\n\n\"Who are you and what do you want?\" asked one.\n\n\"I am the man to whom the chest belongs,\" replied von Horn.  \"If you\nwill take me to Barunda's uncle before Muda Saffir reaches him you\nshall each have the finest rifles that the white man makes, with\nammunition enough to last you a year.  All I ask is that you guide me\nwithin sight of the party that pursues Ninaka; then you may leave me\nand tell no one what you have done, nor will I tell any.  What say you?\"\n\nThe two natives consulted together in low tones.  At last they drew\nnearer the shore.\n\n\"Will you give us each a bracelet of brass as well as the rifles?\"\nasked the spokesman.\n\nVon Horn hesitated.  He knew the native nature well.  To have\nacquiesced too readily would have been to have invited still further\ndemands from them.\n\n\"Only the rifles and ammunition,\" he said at last, \"unless you succeed\nin keeping the knowledge of my presence from both Barunda's uncle and\nMuda Saffir.  If you do that you shall have the bracelets also.\"\n\nThe prow of the sampan touched the bank.\n\n\"Come!\" said one of the warriors.\n\nVon Horn stepped aboard.  He was armed only with a brace of Colts, and\nhe was going into the heart of the wild country of the head hunters, to\npit his wits against those of the wily Muda Saffir.  His guides were\ntwo savage head hunting warriors of a pirate crew from whom he hoped to\nsteal what they considered a fabulously rich treasure.  Whatever sins\nmight be laid to the door of the doctor, there could be no question but\nthat he was a very brave man!\n\nVon Horn's rash adventure had been suggested by the hope that he might,\nby bribing some of the natives with Barunda's uncle, make way with the\ntreasure before Muda Saffir arrived to claim it, or, failing that,\nlearn its exact whereabouts that he might return for it with an\nadequate force later.  That he was taking his life in his hands he well\nknew, but so great was the man's cupidity that he reckoned no risk too\ngreat for the acquirement of a fortune.\n\nThe two Dyaks, paddling in silence up the dark river, proceeded for\nnearly three hours before they drew in to the bank and dragged the\nsampan up into the bushes.  Then they set out upon a narrow trail into\nthe jungle.  It so happened that after travelling for several miles\nthey inadvertently took another path than that followed by the party\nunder Barunda's uncle, so that they passed the latter without being\naware of it, going nearly half a mile to the right of where the\ntrailers camped a short distance from the bivouac of Ninaka.\n\nIn the dead of night Ninaka and his party had crawled away under the\nvery noses of the avengers, taking the chest with them, and by chance\nvon Horn and the two Dyaks cut back into the main trail along the river\nalmost at the very point that Ninaka halted to bury the treasure.\n\nAnd so it was that Bulan was not the only one who watched the hiding of\nthe chest.\n\nWhen Ninaka had disappeared down the river trail Bulan lay speculating\nupon the strange actions he had witnessed.  He wondered why the men\nshould dig a hole in the midst of the jungle to hide away the box which\nhe had so often seen in Professor Maxon's workshop. It occurred to him\nthat it might be well to remember just where the thing was buried, so\nthat he could lead the professor to it should he ever see the old man\nagain.  As he lay thus, half dozing, his attention was attracted by a\nstealthy rustling in the bushes nearby, and as he watched he was\ndumbfounded to see von Horn creep out into the moonlight.  A moment\nlater the man was followed by two Dyaks.  The three stood conversing in\nlow tones, pointing repeatedly at the spot where the chest lay hidden.\nBulan could understand but little of their conversation, but it was\nevident that von Horn was urging some proposition to which the warriors\ndemurred.\n\nSuddenly, without an instant's warning, von Horn drew his gun, wheeled,\nand fired point-blank, first at one of his companions, then at the\nother.  Both men fell in their tracks, and scarcely had the pungent\nodor of the powder smoke reached Bulan's nostrils ere the white man had\nplunged into the jungle and disappeared.\n\nFailing in his attempt to undermine the loyalty of the two Dyaks von\nHorn had chosen the only other way to keep the knowledge of the\nwhereabouts of the chest from Barunda's uncle and Muda Saffir, and now\nhis principal interest in life was to escape the vengeance of the head\nhunters and return to the long-house before his absence should be\ndetected.\n\nThere he could form a party of natives and set out to regain the chest\nafter Muda Saffir and Barunda's uncle had given up the quest.  That\nsuspicion should fall on him seemed scarcely credible since the only\nmen who knew that he had left the long-house that night lay dead upon\nthe very spot where the treasure reposed.\n\n\n\n14\n\nMAN OR MONSTER?\n\n\nWhen Muda Saffir turned from the two Dyaks who had brought him news of\nthe treasure he hastened to the long-house and arousing the chief of\nthe tribe who domiciled there explained that necessity required that\nthe rajah have at once two war prahus fully manned.  Now the power of\nthe crafty old Malay extended from one end of this great river on which\nthe long-house lay to the other, and though not all the tribes admitted\nallegiance to him, yet there were few who would not furnish him with\nmen and boats when he required them; for his piratical cruises carried\nhim often up and down the stream, and with his savage horde it was\npossible for him to wreak summary and terrible vengeance upon those who\nopposed him.\n\nWhen he had explained his wishes to the chief, the latter, though at\nheart hating and fearing Muda Saffir, dared not refuse; but to a second\nproposition he offered strong opposition until the rajah threatened to\nwipe out his entire tribe should he not accede to his demands.\n\nThe thing which the chief demurred to had occurred to Muda Saffir even\nas he walked back from the river after conversing with the two Dyak\nmessengers.  The thought of regaining the treasure, the while he\nadministered punishment to the traitorous Ninaka, filled his soul with\nsavage happiness.  Now if he could but once more possess himself of the\ngirl!  And why not?  There was only the sick old man, a Chinaman and\nvon Horn to prevent it, and the chances were that they all were asleep.\n\nSo he explained to the chief the plan that had so suddenly sprung to\nhis wicked mind.\n\n\"Three men with parangs may easily quiet the old man, his assistant and\nthe Chinaman,\" he said, \"and then we can take the girl along with us.\"\n\nThe chief refused at first, point-blank, to be a party to any such\nproceedings.  He knew what had happened to the Sakkaran Dyaks after\nthey had murdered a party of Englishmen, and he did not purpose laying\nhimself and his tribe open to the vengeance of the white men who came\nin many boats and with countless guns and cannon to take a terrible\ntoll for every drop of white blood spilled.\n\nSo it was that Muda Saffir was forced to compromise, and be satisfied\nwith the chief's assistance in abducting the girl, for it was not so\ndifficult a matter to convince the head hunter that she really had\nbelonged to the rajah, and that she had been stolen from him by the old\nman and the doctor.\n\nVirginia slept in a room with three Dyak women.  It was to this\napartment that the chief finally consented to dispatch two of his\nwarriors.  The men crept noiselessly within the pitch dark interior\nuntil they came to the sleeping form of one of the Dyak women.\nCautiously they awoke her.\n\n\"Where is the white girl?\" asked one of the men in a low whisper.\n\"Muda Saffir has sent us for her.  Tell her that her father is very\nsick and wants her, but do not mention Muda Saffir's name lest she\nmight not come.\"\n\nThe whispering awakened Virginia and she lay wondering what the cause\nof the midnight conference might be, for she recognized that one of the\nspeakers was a man, and there had been no man in the apartment when she\nhad gone to sleep earlier in the night.\n\nPresently she heard some one approach her, and a moment later a woman's\nvoice addressed her; but she could not understand enough of the native\ntongue to make out precisely the message the speaker wished to convey.\nThe words \"father,\" \"sick,\" and \"come,\" however she finally understood\nafter several repetitions, for she had picked up a smattering of the\nDyak language during her enforced association with the natives.\n\nThe moment that the possibilities suggested by these few words dawned\nupon her, she sprang to her feet and followed the woman toward the door\nof the apartment.  Immediately without the two warriors stood upon the\nverandah awaiting their victim, and as Virginia passed through the\ndoorway she was seized roughly from either side, a heavy hand was\nclapped over her mouth, and before she could make even an effort to\nrebel she had been dragged to the end of the verandah, down the notched\nlog to the ground and a moment later found herself in a war prahu which\nwas immediately pushed into the stream.\n\nSince Virginia had come to the long-house after her rescue from the\nourang outangs, supposedly by von Horn, Rajah Muda Saffir had kept very\nmuch out of sight, for he knew that should the girl see him she would\nrecognize him as the man who had stolen her from the Ithaca.  So it\ncame as a mighty shock to the girl when she heard the hated tones of\nthe man whom she had knocked overboard from the prahu two nights\nbefore, and realized that the bestial Malay sat close beside her, and\nthat she was again in his power.  She looked now for no mercy, nor\ncould she hope to again escape him so easily as she had before, and so\nshe sat with bowed head in the bottom of the swiftly moving craft,\nburied in anguished thoughts, hopeless and miserable.\n\nAlong the stretch of black river that the prahu and her consort covered\nthat night Virginia Maxon saw no living thing other than a single\nfigure in a small sampan which hugged the shadows of the shore as the\ntwo larger boats met and passed it, nor answered their hail.\n\nWhere von Horn and his two Dyak guides had landed, Muda Saffir's force\ndisembarked and plunged into the jungle.  Rapidly they hastened along\nthe well known trail toward the point designated by the two messengers,\nto come upon the spot almost simultaneously with the party under\nBarunda's uncle, who, startled by the two shots several hours\npreviously, had been cautiously searching through the jungle for an\nexplanation of them.\n\nThey had gone warily for fear that they might stumble upon Ninaka's\nparty before Muda Saffir arrived with reinforcements, and but just now\nhad they discovered the prostrate forms of their two companions.  One\nwas dead, but the other was still conscious and had just sufficient\nvitality left after the coming of his fellows to whisper that they had\nbeen treacherously shot by the younger white man who had been at the\nlong-house where they had found Muda Saffir--then the fellow expired\nwithout having an opportunity to divulge the secret hiding place of the\ntreasure, over the top of which his body lay.\n\nNow Bulan had been an interested witness of all that transpired.  At\nfirst he had been inclined to come out of his hiding place and follow\nvon Horn, but so much had already occurred beneath the branches of the\ngreat tree where the chest lay hidden that he decided to wait until\nmorning at least, for he was sure that he had by no means seen the last\nof the drama which surrounded the heavy box.  This belief was\nstrengthened by the haste displayed by both Ninaka and von Horn to\nescape the neighborhood as quickly as possible, as though they feared\nthat they might be apprehended should they delay even for a moment.\n\nNumber Three and Number Twelve still slept, not having been aroused\neven by the shots fired by von Horn.  Bulan himself had dozed after the\ndeparture of the doctor, but the advent of Barunda's uncle with his\nfollowers had awakened him, and now he lay wide eyed and alert as the\nsecond party, under Muda Saffir, came into view when they left the\njungle trail and entered the clearing.\n\nHis interest in either party was but passive until he saw the khaki\nblouse, short skirt and trim leggins of the captive walking between two\nof the Dyaks of Muda Saffir's company.  At the same instant he\nrecognized the evil features of the rajah as those of the man who had\ndirected the abduction of Virginia Maxon from the wrecked Ithaca.\n\nLike a great cat Bulan drew himself cautiously to all fours--every\nnerve and muscle taut with the excitement of the moment.  Before him he\nsaw a hundred and fifty ferocious Borneo head hunters, armed with\nparangs, spears and sumpitans.  At his back slept two almost brainless\ncreatures--his sole support against the awful odds he must face before\nhe could hope to succor the divinity whose image was enshrined in his\nbrave and simple heart.\n\nThe muscles stood out upon his giant forearm as he gripped the stock of\nhis bull whip.  He believed that he was going to his death, for mighty\nas were his thews he knew that in the face of the horde they would\navail him little, yet he saw no other way than to sit supinely by while\nthe girl went to her doom, and that he could not do.  He nudged Number\nTwelve.  \"Silence!\" he whispered, and \"Come!  The girl is here.  We\nmust save her.  Kill the men,\" and the same to the hairy and terrible\nNumber Three.\n\nBoth the creatures awoke and rose to their hands and knees without\nnoise that could be heard above the chattering of the natives, who had\ncrowded forward to view the dead bodies of von Horn's victims.\nSilently Bulan came to his feet, the two monsters at his back rising\nand pressing close behind him.  Along the denser shadows the three\ncrept to a position in the rear of the natives.  The girl's guards had\nstepped forward with the others to join in the discussion that followed\nthe dying statement of the murdered warrior, leaving her upon the outer\nfringe of the crowd.\n\nFor an instant a sudden hope of escape sprang to Virginia Maxon's\nmind--there was none between her and the jungle through which they had\njust passed.  Though unknown dangers lurked in the black and uncanny\ndepths of the dismal forest, would not death in any form be far\npreferable to the hideous fate which awaited her in the person of the\nbestial Malay pirate?\n\nShe had turned to take the first step toward freedom when three figures\nemerged from the wall of darkness behind her.  She saw the war-caps,\nshields, and war-coats, and her heart sank.  Here were others of the\nrajah's party--stragglers who had come just in time to thwart her\nplans.  How large these men were--she never had seen a native of such\ngiant proportions; and now they had come quite close to her, and as the\nforemost stooped to speak to her she shrank back in fear.  Then, to her\nsurprise, she heard in whispered English; \"Come quietly, while they are\nnot looking.\"\n\nShe thought the voice familiar, but could not place it, though her\nheart whispered that it might belong to the young stranger of her\ndreams.  He reached out and took her hand and together they turned and\nwalked quickly toward the jungle, followed by the two who had\naccompanied him.\n\nScarcely had they covered half the distance before one of the Dyaks\nwhose duty it had been to guard the girl discovered that she was gone.\nWith a cry he alarmed his fellows, and in another instant a sharp pair\nof eyes caught the movement of the four who had now broken into a run.\n\nWith savage shouts the entire force of head hunters sprang in pursuit.\nBulan lifted Virginia in his arms and dashed on ahead of Number Twelve\nand Number Three.  A shower of poisoned darts blown from half a hundred\nsumpitans fell about them, and then Muda Saffir called to his warriors\nto cease using their deadly blow-pipes lest they kill the girl.\n\nInto the jungle dashed the four while close behind them came the\nhowling pack of enraged savages.  Now one closed upon Number Three only\nto fall back dead with a broken neck as the giant fingers released\ntheir hold upon him.  A parang swung close to Number Twelve, but his\nown, which he had now learned to wield with fearful effect, clove\nthrough the pursuing warrior's skull splitting him wide to the breast\nbone.\n\nThus they fought the while they forced their way deeper and deeper into\nthe dark mazes of the entangled vegetation.  The brunt of the running\nbattle was borne by the two monsters, for Bulan was carrying Virginia,\nand keeping a little ahead of his companions to insure the girl's\ngreater safety.\n\nNow and then patches of moonlight filtering through occasional openings\nin the leafy roofing revealed to Virginia the battle that was being\nwaged for possession of her, and once, when Number Three turned toward\nher after disposing of a new assailant, she was horrified to see the\ngrotesque and terrible face of the creature.  A moment later she caught\nsight of Number Twelve's hideous face.  She was appalled.\n\nCould it be that she had been rescued from the Malay to fall into the\nhands of creatures equally heartless and entirely without souls?  She\nglanced up at the face of him who carried her.  In the darkness of the\nnight she had not yet had an opportunity to see the features of the\nman, but after a glimpse at those of his two companions she trembled to\nthink of the hideous thing that might be revealed to her.\n\nCould it be that she had at last fallen into the hands of the dreaded\nand terrible Number Thirteen!  Instinctively she shrank from contact\nwith the man in whose arms she had been carried without a trace of\nrepugnance until the thought obtruded itself that he might be the\ncreature of her father's mad experimentation, to whose arms she had\nbeen doomed by the insane obsession of her parent.\n\nThe man shifted her now to give himself freer use of his right arm, for\nthe savages were pressing more closely upon Twelve and Three, and the\nchange made it impossible for the girl to see his face even in the more\nfrequent moonlit places.\n\nBut she could see the two who ran and fought just behind them, and she\nshuddered at her inevitable fate.  For should the three be successful\nin bearing her away from the Dyaks she must face an unknown doom, while\nshould the natives recapture her there was the terrible Malay into\nwhose clutches she had already twice fallen.\n\nNow the head hunters were pressing closer, and suddenly, even as the\ngirl looked directly at him, a spear passed through the heart of Number\nThree.  Clutching madly at the shaft protruding from his misshapen body\nthe grotesque thing stumbled on for a dozen paces, and then sank to the\nground as two of the brown warriors sprang upon him with naked parangs.\nAn instant later Virginia Maxon saw the hideous and grisly head\nswinging high in the hand of a dancing, whooping savage.\n\nThe man who carried her was now forced to turn and fight off the enemy\nthat pressed forward past Number Twelve.  The mighty bull whip whirled\nand cracked across the heads and faces of the Dyaks.  It was a\nformidable weapon when backed by the Herculean muscles that rolled and\nshifted beneath Bulan's sun-tanned skin, and many were the brown\nwarriors that went down beneath its cruel lash.\n\nVirginia could see that the creature who bore her was not deformed of\nbody, but she shrank from the thought of what a sight of his face might\nreveal.  How much longer the two could fight off the horde at their\nheels the girl could not guess; and as a matter of fact she was\nindifferent to the outcome of the strange, running battle that was\nbeing waged with herself as the victor's spoil.\n\nThe country now was becoming rougher and more open.  The flight seemed\nto be leading into a range of low hills, where the jungle grew less\ndense, and the way rocky and rugged.  They had entered a narrow canyon\nwhen Number Twelve went down beneath a half dozen parangs.  Again the\ngirl saw a bloody head swung on high and heard the fierce, wild chorus\nof exulting victory.  She wondered how long it would be ere the\ncreature beneath her would add his share to the grim trophies of the\nhunt.\n\nIn the interval that the head hunters had paused to sever Number\nTwelve's head, Bulan had gained fifty yards upon them, and then, of a\nsudden, he came to a sheer wall rising straight across the narrow trail\nhe had been following.  Ahead there was no way--a cat could scarce have\nscaled that formidable barrier--but to the right he discerned what\nappeared to be a steep and winding pathway up the canyon's side, and\nwith a bound he clambered along it to where it surmounted the rocky\nwall.\n\nThere he turned, winded, to await the oncoming foe.  Here was a spot\nwhere a single man might defy an army, and Bulan had been quick to see\nthe natural advantages of it.  He placed the girl upon her feet behind\na protruding shoulder of the canyon's wall which rose to a considerable\ndistance still above them.  Then he turned to face the mob that was\nsurging up the narrow pathway toward him.\n\nAt his feet lay an accumulation of broken rock from the hillside above,\nand as a spear sped, singing, close above his shoulder, the occurrence\nsuggested a use for the rough and jagged missiles which lay about him\nin such profusion.  Many of the pieces were large, weighing twenty and\nthirty pounds, and some even as much as fifty.  Picking up one of the\nlarger Bulan raised it high above his head, and then hurled it down\namongst the upclimbing warriors.  In an instant pandemonium reigned,\nfor the heavy boulder had mowed down a score of the pursuers, breaking\narms and legs in its meteoric descent.\n\nMissile after missile Bulan rained down upon the struggling, howling\nDyaks, until, seized by panic, they turned and fled incontinently down\ninto the depths of the canyon and back along the narrow trail they had\ncome, and then superstitious fear completed the rout that the flying\nrocks had started, for one whispered to another that this was the\nterrible Bulan and that he had but lured them on into the hills that he\nmight call forth all his demons and destroy them.\n\nFor a moment Bulan stood watching the retreating savages, a smile upon\nhis lips, and then as the sudden equatorial dawn burst forth he turned\nto face the girl.\n\nAs Virginia Maxon saw the fine features of the giant where she had\nexpected to find the grotesque and hideous lineaments of a monster, she\ngave a quick little cry of pleasure and relief.\n\n\"Thank God!\" she cried fervently.  \"Thank God that you are a man--I\nthought that I was in the clutches of the hideous and soulless monster,\nNumber Thirteen.\"\n\nThe smile upon the young man's face died.  An expression of pain, and\nhopelessness, and sorrow swept across his features.  The girl saw the\nchange, and wondered, but how could she guess the grievous wound her\nwords had inflicted?\n\n\n\n15\n\nTOO LATE\n\n\nFor a moment the two stood in silence; Bulan tortured by thoughts of\nthe bitter humiliation that he must suffer when the girl should learn\nhis identity; Virginia wondering at the sad lines that had come into\nthe young man's face, and at his silence.\n\nIt was the girl who first spoke.  \"Who are you,\" she asked, \"to whom I\nowe my safety?\"\n\nThe man hesitated.  To speak aught than the truth had never occurred to\nhim during his brief existence.  He scarcely knew how to lie.  To him a\nquestion demanded but one manner of reply--the facts.  But never before\nhad he had to face a question where so much depended upon his answer.\nHe tried to form the bitter, galling words; but a vision of that lovely\nface suddenly transformed with horror and disgust throttled the name in\nhis throat.\n\n\"I am Bulan,\" he said, at last, quietly.\n\n\"Bulan,\" repeated the girl.  \"Bulan.  Why that is a native name.  You\nare either an Englishman or an American.  What is your true name?\"\n\n\"My name is Bulan,\" he insisted doggedly.\n\nVirginia Maxon thought that he must have some good reason of his own\nfor wishing to conceal his identity.  At first she wondered if he could\nbe a fugitive from justice--the perpetrator of some horrid crime, who\ndared not divulge his true name even in the remote fastness of a\nBornean wilderness; but a glance at his frank and noble countenance\ndrove every vestige of the traitorous thought from her mind.  Her\nwoman's intuition was sufficient guarantee of the nobility of his\ncharacter.\n\n\"Then let me thank you, Mr. Bulan,\" she said, \"for the service that you\nhave rendered a strange and helpless woman.\"\n\nHe smiled.\n\n\"Just Bulan,\" he said.  \"There is no need for Miss or Mister in the\nsavage jungle, Virginia.\"\n\nThe girl flushed at the sudden and unexpected use of her given name,\nand was surprised that she was not offended.\n\n\"How do you know my name?\" she asked.\n\nBulan saw that he would get into deep water if he attempted to explain\ntoo much, and, as is ever the way, discovered that one deception had\nled him into another; so he determined to forestall future embarrassing\nqueries by concocting a story immediately to explain his presence and\nhis knowledge.\n\n\"I lived upon the island near your father's camp,\" he said.  \"I knew\nyou all--by sight.\"\n\n\"How long have you lived there?\" asked the girl.  \"We thought the\nisland uninhabited.\"\n\n\"All my life,\" replied Bulan truthfully.\n\n\"It is strange,\" she mused.  \"I cannot understand it.  But the\nmonsters--how is it that they followed you and obeyed your commands?\"\n\nBulan touched the bull whip that hung at his side.\n\n\"Von Horn taught them to obey this,\" he said.\n\n\"He used that upon them?\" cried the girl in horror.\n\n\"It was the only way,\" said Bulan.  \"They were almost brainless--they\ncould understand nothing else, for they could not reason.\"\n\nVirginia shuddered.\n\n\"Where are they now--the balance of them?\" she asked.\n\n\"They are dead, poor things,\" he replied, sadly.  \"Poor, hideous,\nunloved, unloving monsters--they gave up their lives for the daughter\nof the man who made them the awful, repulsive creatures that they were.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" cried the girl.\n\n\"I mean that all have been killed searching for you, and battling with\nyour enemies.  They were soulless creatures, but they loved the mean\nlives they gave up so bravely for you whose father was the author of\ntheir misery--you owe a great deal to them, Virginia.\"\n\n\"Poor things,\" murmured the girl, \"but yet they are better off, for\nwithout brains or souls there could be no happiness in life for them.\nMy father did them a hideous wrong, but it was an unintentional wrong.\nHis mind was crazed with dwelling upon the wonderful discovery he had\nmade, and if he wronged them he contemplated a still more terrible\nwrong to be inflicted upon me, his daughter.\"\n\n\"I do not understand,\" said Bulan.\n\n\"It was his intention to give me in marriage to one of his soulless\nmonsters--to the one he called Number Thirteen.  Oh, it is terrible\neven to think of the hideousness of it; but now they are all dead he\ncannot do it even though his poor mind, which seems well again, should\nsuffer a relapse.\"\n\n\"Why do you loathe them so?\" asked Bulan.  \"Is it because they are\nhideous, or because they are soulless?\"\n\n\"Either fact were enough to make them repulsive,\" replied the girl,\n\"but it is the fact that they were without souls that made them totally\nimpossible--one easily overlooks physical deformity, but the moral\ndepravity that must be inherent in a creature without a soul must\nforever cut him off from intercourse with human beings.\"\n\n\"And you think that regardless of their physical appearance the fact\nthat they were without souls would have been apparent?\" asked Bulan.\n\n\"I am sure of it,\" cried Virginia.  \"I would know the moment I set my\neyes upon a creature without a soul.\"\n\nWith all the sorrow that was his, Bulan could scarce repress a smile,\nfor it was quite evident either that it was impossible to perceive a\nsoul, or else that he possessed one.\n\n\"Just how do you distinguish the possessor of a soul?\" he asked.\n\nThe girl cast a quick glance up at him.\n\n\"You are making fun of me,\" she said.\n\n\"Not at all,\" he replied.  \"I am just curious as to how souls make\nthemselves apparent.  I have seen men kill one another as beasts kill.\nI have seen one who was cruel to those within his power, yet they were\nall men with souls.  I have seen eleven soulless monsters die to save\nthe daughter of a man whom they believed had wronged them terribly--a\nman with a soul.  How then am I to know what attributes denote the\npossession of the immortal spark?  How am I to know whether or not I\npossess a soul?\"\n\nVirginia smiled.\n\n\"You are courageous and honorable and chivalrous--those are enough to\nwarrant the belief that you have a soul, were it not apparent from your\ncountenance that you are of the higher type of mankind,\" she said.\n\n\"I hope that you will never change your opinion of me, Virginia,\" said\nthe man; but he knew that there lay before her a severe shock, and\nbefore him a great sorrow when they should come to where her father was\nand the girl should learn the truth concerning him.\n\nThat he did not himself tell her may be forgiven him, for he had only a\nlife of misery to look forward to after she should know that he, too,\nwas equally a soulless monster with the twelve that had preceded him to\na merciful death.  He would have envied them but for the anticipation\nof the time that he might be alone with her before she learned the\ntruth.\n\nAs he pondered the future there came to him the thought that should\nthey never find Professor Maxon or von Horn the girl need never know\nbut that he was a human being.  He need not lose her then, but always\nbe near her.  The idea grew and with it the mighty temptation to lead\nVirginia Maxon far into the jungle, and keep her forever from the sight\nof men.  And why not? Had he not saved her where others had failed?\nWas she not, by all that was just and fair, his?\n\nDid he owe any loyalty to either her father or von Horn?  Already he\nhad saved Professor Maxon's life, so the obligation, if there was any,\nlay all against the older man; and three times he had saved Virginia.\nHe would be very kind and good to her.  She should be much happier and\na thousand times safer than with those others who were so poorly\nequipped to protect her.\n\nAs he stood silently gazing out across the jungle beneath them toward\nthe new sun the girl watched him in a spell of admiration of his strong\nand noble face, and his perfect physique.  What would have been her\nemotions had she guessed what thoughts were his!  It was she who broke\nthe silence.\n\n\"Can you find the way to the long-house where my father is?\" she asked.\n\nBulan, startled at the question, looked up from his reverie.  The thing\nmust be faced, then, sooner than he thought.  How was he to tell her of\nhis intention?  It occurred to him to sound her first--possibly she\nwould make no objection to the plan.\n\n\"You are anxious to return?\" he asked.\n\n\"Why, yes, of course, I am,\" she replied.  \"My father will be half mad\nwith apprehension, until he knows that I am safe.  What a strange\nquestion, indeed.\"  Still, however, she did not doubt the motives of\nher companion.\n\n\"Suppose we should be unable to find our way to the long-house?\" he\ncontinued.\n\n\"Oh, don't say such a thing,\" cried the girl.  \"It would be terrible.\nI should die of misery and fright and loneliness in this awful jungle.\nSurely you can find your way to the river--it was but a short march\nthrough the jungle from where we landed to the spot at which you took\nme away from that fearful Malay.\"\n\nThe girl's words cast a cloud over Bulan's hopes.  The future looked\nless roseate with the knowledge that she would be unhappy in the life\nthat he had been mapping for them.  He was silent--thinking.  In his\nbreast a riot of conflicting emotions were waging the first great\nbattle which was to point the trend of the man's character--would the\nselfish and the base prevail, or would the noble?\n\nWith the thought of losing her his desire for her companionship became\nalmost a mania.  To return her to her father and von Horn would be to\nlose her--of that there could be no doubt, for they would not leave her\nlong in ignorance of his origin.  Then, in addition to being deprived\nof her forever, he must suffer the galling mortification of her scorn.\n\nIt was a great deal to ask of a fledgling morality that was yet\nscarcely cognizant of its untried wings; but even as the man wavered\nbetween right and wrong there crept into his mind the one great and\nburning question of his life--had he a soul?  And he knew that upon his\ndecision of the fate of Virginia Maxon rested to some extent the true\nanswer to that question, for, unconsciously, he had worked out his own\ncrude soul hypothesis which imparted to this invisible entity the power\nto direct his actions only for good.  Therefore he reasoned that\nwickedness presupposed a small and worthless soul, or the entire lack\nof one.\n\nThat she would hate a soulless creature he accepted as a foregone\nconclusion.  He desired her respect, and that fact helped him to his\nfinal decision, but the thing that decided him was born of the truly\nchivalrous nature he possessed--he wanted Virginia Maxon to be happy;\nit mattered not at what cost to him.\n\nThe girl had been watching him closely as he stood silently thinking\nafter her last words.  She did not know the struggle that the calm face\nhid; yet she felt that the dragging moments were big with the question\nof her fate.\n\n\"Well?\" she said at length.\n\n\"We must eat first,\" he replied in a matter-of-fact tone, and not at\nall as though he was about to renounce his life's happiness, \"and then\nwe shall set out in search of your father.  I shall take you to him,\nVirginia, if man can find him.\"\n\n\"I knew that you could,\" she said, simply, \"but how my father and I\never can repay you I do not know--do you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Bulan, and there was a sudden rush of fire to his eyes that\nkept Virginia Maxon from urging a detailed explanation of just how she\nmight repay him.\n\nIn truth she did not know whether to be angry, or frightened, or glad\nof the truth that she read there; or mortified that it had awakened in\nher a realization that possibly an analysis of her own interest in this\nyoung stranger might reveal more than she had imagined.\n\nThe constraint that suddenly fell upon them was relieved when Bulan\nmotioned her to follow him back down the trail into the gorge in search\nof food.  There they sat together upon a fallen tree beside a tiny\nrivulet, eating the fruit that the man gathered.  Often their eyes met\nas they talked, but always the girl's fell before the open worship of\nthe man's.\n\nMany were the men who had looked in admiration at Virginia Maxon in the\npast, but never, she felt, with eyes so clean and brave and honest.\nThere was no guile or evil in them, and because of it she wondered all\nthe more that she could not face them.\n\n\"What a wonderful soul those eyes portray,\" she thought, \"and how\nperfectly they assure the safety of my life and honor while their owner\nis near me.\"\n\nAnd the man thought: \"Would that I owned a soul that I might aspire to\nlive always near her--always to protect her.\"\n\nWhen they had eaten the two set out once more in search of the river,\nand the confidence that is born of ignorance was theirs, so that beyond\neach succeeding tangled barrier of vines and creepers they looked to\nsee the swirling stream that would lead them to the girl's father.\n\nOn and on they trudged, the man often carrying the girl across the\nrougher obstacles and through the little streams that crossed their\npath, until at last came noon, and yet no sign of the river they\nsought.  The combined jungle craft of the two had been insufficient\neither to trace the way that they had come, or point the general\ndirection of the river.\n\nAs the afternoon drew to a close Virginia Maxon commenced to lose\nheart--she was confident that they were lost.  Bulan made no pretence\nof knowing the way, the most that he would say being that eventually\nthey must come to the river.  As a matter-of-fact had it not been for\nthe girl's evident concern he would have been glad to know that they\nwere irretrievably lost; but for her sake his efforts to find the river\nwere conscientious.\n\nWhen at last night closed down upon them the girl was, at heart, terror\nstricken, but she hid her true state from the man, because she knew\nthat their plight was no fault of his.  The strange and uncanny noises\nof the jungle night filled her with the most dreadful forebodings, and\nwhen a cold, drizzling rain set in upon them her cup of misery was full.\n\nBulan rigged a rude shelter for her, making her lie down beneath it,\nand then he removed his Dyak war-coat and threw it over her, but it was\nhours before her exhausted body overpowered her nervous fright and won\na fitful and restless slumber.  Several times Virginia became obsessed\nwith the idea that Bulan had left her alone there in the jungle, but\nwhen she called his name he answered from close beside her shelter.\n\nShe thought that he had reared another for himself nearby, but even the\nthought that he might sleep filled her with dread, yet she would not\ncall to him again, since she knew that he needed his rest even more\nthan she.  And all the night Bulan stood close beside the woman he had\nlearned to love--stood almost naked in the chill night air and the cold\nrain, lest some savage man or beast creep out of the darkness after her\nwhile he slept.\n\nThe next day with its night, and the next, and the next were but\nrepetitions of the first.  It had become an agony of suffering for the\nman to fight off sleep longer.  The girl read part of the truth in his\nheavy eyes and worn face, and tried to force him to take needed rest,\nbut she did not guess that he had not slept for four days and nights.\n\nAt last abused Nature succumbed to the terrific strain that had been\nput upon her, and the giant constitution of the man went down before\nthe cold and the wet, weakened and impoverished by loss of sleep and\ninsufficient food; for through the last two days he had been able to\nfind but little, and that little he had given to the girl, telling her\nthat he had eaten his fill while he gathered hers.\n\nIt was on the fifth morning, when Virginia awoke, that she found Bulan\nrolling and tossing upon the wet ground before her shelter, delirious\nwith fever.  At the sight of the mighty figure reduced to pitiable\ninefficiency and weakness, despite the knowledge that her protector\ncould no longer protect, the fear of the jungle faded from the heart of\nthe young girl--she was no more a weak and trembling daughter of an\neffete civilization.  Instead she was a lioness, watching over and\nprotecting her sick mate.  The analogy did not occur to her, but\nsomething else did as she saw the flushed face and fever wracked body\nof the man whose appeal to her she would have thought purely physical\nhad she given the subject any analytic consideration; and as a\nrealization of his utter helplessness came to her she bent over him and\nkissed first his forehead and then his lips.\n\n\"What a noble and unselfish love yours has been,\" she murmured.  \"You\nhave even tried to hide it that my position might be the easier to\nbear, and now that it may be too late I learn that I love you--that I\nhave always loved you.  Oh, Bulan, my Bulan, what a cruel fate that\npermitted us to find one another only to die together!\"\n\n\n\n16\n\nSING SPEAKS\n\n\nFor a week Professor Maxon with von Horn and Sing sought for Virginia.\nThey could get no help from the natives of the long-house, who feared\nthe vengeance of Muda Saffir should he learn that they had aided the\nwhite men upon his trail.\n\nAnd always as the three hunted through the jungle and up and down the\nriver there lurked ever near a handful of the men of the tribe of the\ntwo whom von Horn had murdered, waiting for the chance that would give\nthem revenge and the heads of the three they followed.  They feared the\nguns of the white men too much to venture an open attack, and at night\nthe quarry never abated their watchfulness, so that days dragged on,\nand still the three continued their hopeless quest unconscious of the\nrelentless foe that dogged their footsteps.\n\nVon Horn was always searching for an opportunity to enlist the aid of\nthe friendly natives in an effort to regain the chest, but so far he\nhad found none who would agree to accompany him even in consideration\nof a large share of the booty.  It was the treasure alone which kept\nhim to the search for Virginia Maxon, and he made it a point to direct\nthe hunt always in the vicinity of the spot where it was buried, for a\ngreat fear consumed him that Ninaka might return and claim it before he\nhad a chance to make away with it.\n\nThree times during the week they returned and slept at the long-house,\nhoping each time to learn that the natives had received some news of\nher they sought, through the wonderful channels of communication that\nseemed always open across the trackless jungle and up and down the\nsavage, lonely rivers.\n\nFor two days Bulan lay raving in the delirium of fever, while the\ndelicate girl, unused to hardship and exposure, watched over him and\nnursed him with the loving tenderness and care of a young mother with\nher first born.\n\nFor the most part the young giant's ravings were inarticulate, but now\nand then Virginia heard her name linked with words of reverence and\nworship.  The man fought again the recent battles he had passed\nthrough, and again suffered the long night watches beside the sleeping\ngirl who filled his heart.  Then it was that she learned the truth of\nhis self-sacrificing devotion.  The thing that puzzled her most was the\nrepetition of a number and a name which ran through all his\ndelirium--\"Nine ninety nine Priscilla.\"\n\nShe could make neither head nor tail of it, nor was there another word\nto give a clue to its meaning, so at last from constant repetition it\nbecame a commonplace and she gave it no further thought.\n\nThe girl had given up hope that Bulan ever could recover, so weak and\nemaciated had he become, and when the fever finally left him quite\nsuddenly she was positive that it was the beginning of the end.  It was\non the morning of the seventh day since they had commenced their\nwandering in search of the long-house that, as she sat watching him,\nshe saw his eyes resting upon her face with a look of recognition.\n\nGently she took his hand, and at the act he smiled at her very weakly.\n\n\"You are better, Bulan,\" she said.  \"You have been very sick, but now\nyou shall soon be well again.\"\n\nShe did not believe her own words, yet the mere saying of them gave her\nrenewed hope.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the man.  \"I shall soon be well again.  How long have I\nbeen like this?\"\n\n\"For two days,\" she replied.\n\n\"And you have watched over me alone in the jungle for two days?\" he\nasked incredulously.\n\n\"Had it been for life,\" she said in a low voice, \"it would scarce have\nrepaid the debt I owe you.\"\n\nFor a long time he lay looking up into her eyes--longingly, wistfully.\n\n\"I wish that it had been for life,\" he said.\n\nAt first she did not quite realize what he meant, but presently the\ntired and hopeless expression of his eyes brought to her a sudden\nknowledge of his meaning.\n\n\"Oh, Bulan,\" she cried, \"you must not say that.  Why should you wish to\ndie?\"\n\n\"Because I love you, Virginia,\" he replied.  \"And because, when you\nknow what I am, you will hate and loathe me.\"\n\nOn the girl's lips was an avowal of her own love, but as she bent\ncloser to whisper the words in his ear there came the sound of men\ncrashing through the jungle, and as she turned to face the peril that\nshe thought approaching, von Horn sprang into view, while directly\nbehind him came her father and Sing Lee.\n\nBulan saw them at the same instant, and as Virginia ran forward to\ngreet her father he staggered weakly to his feet.  Von Horn was the\nfirst to see the young giant, and with an oath sprang toward him,\ndrawing his revolver as he came.\n\n\"You beast,\" he cried.  \"We have caught you at last.\"\n\nAt the words Virginia turned back toward Bulan with a little scream of\nwarning and of horror.  Professor Maxon was behind her.\n\n\"Shoot the monster, von Horn,\" he ordered.  \"Do not let him escape.\"\n\nBulan drew himself to his full height, and though he wavered from\nweakness, yet he towered mighty and magnificent above the evil faced\nman who menaced him.\n\n\"Shoot!\" he said calmly.  \"Death cannot come too soon now.\"\n\nAt the same instant von Horn pulled the trigger.  The giant's head fell\nback, he staggered, whirled about, and crumpled to the earth just as\nVirginia Maxon's arms closed about him.\n\nVon Horn rushed close and pushing the girl aside pressed the muzzle of\nhis gun to Bulan's temple, but an avalanche of wrinkled, yellow skin\nwas upon him before he could pull the trigger a second time, and Sing\nhad hurled him back a dozen feet and snatched his weapon.\n\nMoaning and sobbing Virginia threw herself upon the body of the man she\nloved, while Professor Maxon hurried to her side to drag her away from\nthe soulless thing for whom he had once intended her.\n\nLike a tigress the girl turned upon the two white men.\n\n\"You are murderers,\" she cried.  \"Cowardly murderers.  Weak and\nexhausted by fever he could not combat you, and so you have robbed the\nworld of one of the noblest men that God ever created.\"\n\n\"Hush!\" cried Professor Maxon.  \"Hush, child, you do not know what you\nsay.  The thing was a monster--a soulless monster.\"\n\nAt the words the girl looked up quickly at her father, a faint\nrealization of his meaning striking her like a blow in the face.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" she whispered.  \"Who was he?\"\n\nIt was von Horn who answered.\n\n\"No god created that,\" he said, with a contemptuous glance at the still\nbody of the man at their feet.  \"He was one of the creatures of your\nfather's mad experiments--the soulless thing for whose arms his insane\nobsession doomed you.  The thing at your feet, Virginia, was Number\nThirteen.\"\n\nWith a piteous little moan the girl turned back toward the body of the\nyoung giant.  A faltering step she took toward it, and then to the\nhorror of her father she sank upon her knees beside it and lifting the\nman's head in her arms covered the face with kisses.\n\n\"Virginia!\" cried the professor.  \"Are you mad, child?\"\n\n\"I am not mad,\" she moaned, \"not yet.  I love him.  Man or monster, it\nwould have been all the same to me, for I loved him.\"\n\nHer father turned away, burying his face in his hands.\n\n\"God!\" he muttered.  \"What an awful punishment you have visited upon me\nfor the sin of the thing I did.\"\n\nThe silence which followed was broken by Sing who had kneeled opposite\nVirginia upon the other side of Bulan, where he was feeling the giant's\nwrists and pressing his ear close above his heart.\n\n\"Do'n cly, Linee,\" said the kindly old Chinaman.  \"Him no dlead.\"\nThen, as he poured a pinch of brownish powder into the man's mouth from\na tiny sack he had brought forth from the depths of one of his sleeves:\n\"Him no mlonster either, Linee.  Him white man, alsame Mlaxon.  Sing\nknow.\"\n\nThe girl looked up at him in gratitude.\n\n\"He is not dead, Sing?  He will live?\" she cried.  \"I don't care about\nanything else, Sing, if you will only make him live.\"\n\n\"Him live.  Gettem lilee flesh wounds.  Las all.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by saying that he is not a monster?\" demanded von\nHorn.\n\n\"You waitee, you dam flool,\" cried Sing.  \"I tellee lot more I know.\nYou waitee I flixee him, and then, by God, I flixee you.\"\n\nVon Horn took a menacing step toward the Chinaman, his face black with\nwrath, but Professor Maxon interposed.\n\n\"This has gone quite far enough, Doctor von Horn,\" he said.  \"It may be\nthat we acted hastily.  I do not know, of course, what Sing means, but\nI intend to find out.  He has been very faithful to us, and deserves\nevery consideration.\"\n\nVon Horn stepped back, still scowling.  Sing poured a little water\nbetween Bulan's lips, and then asked Professor Maxon for his brandy\nflask.  With the first few drops of the fiery liquid the giant's\neyelids moved, and a moment later he raised them and looked about him.\n\nThe first face he saw was Virginia's.  It was full of love and\ncompassion.\n\n\"They have not told you yet?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied.  \"They have told me, but it makes no difference.\nYou have given me the right to say it, Bulan, and I do say it now\nagain, before them all--I love you, and that is all there is that makes\nany difference.\"\n\nA look of happiness lighted his face momentarily, only to fade as\nquickly as it had come.\n\n\"No, Virginia,\" he said, sadly, \"it would not be right.  It would be\nwicked.  I am not a human being.  I am only a soulless monster.  You\ncannot mate with such as I.  You must go away with your father.  Soon\nyou will forget me.\"\n\n\"Never, Bulan!\" cried the girl, determinedly.\n\nThe man was about to attempt to dissuade her, when Sing interrupted.\n\n\"You keepee still, Bulan,\" he said.  \"You wait till Sing tellee.  You\nno mlonster.  Mlaxon he no makee you.  Sing he find you in low bloat\njus' outsidee cove.  You dummy.  No know nothing.  No know namee.  No\nknow where comee from.  No talkee.\n\n\"Sing he jes' hearee Mlaxon tellee Hornee 'bout Nlumber Thlirteen.  How\nhe makee him for Linee.  Makee Linee mally him.  Sing he know what\nkindee fleaks Mlaxon makee.  Linee always good to old Sing.  Sing he\nbeen peeking thlu clack in wallee.  See blig vlat where Thlirteen\ngrowing.\n\n\"Sing he takee you to Sing's shackee that night.

Thlirteen clome too soonee, but allight; him finee,\nperfec' man.  Whoop!\n\n\"Anyway, you heap better for Linee than one Mlaxon's fleaks,\" he\nconcluded, turning toward Bulan.\n\n\"You are lying, you yellow devil,\" cried von Horn.\n\nThe Chinaman turned his shrewd, slant eyes malevolently upon the doctor.\n\n\"Sing lies?\" he hissed.  \"Mabbeso Sing lies when he ask what for you\nglet Bludleen steal tleasure.  But Lajah Saffir he come and spoil it\nall while you tly glet Linee to the ship--Sing knows.\n\n\"Then you tellee Mlaxon Thlirteen steal Linee.  You lie then and you\nknew you lie.  You lie again when Thlirteen savee Linee flom Oulang\nOutang--you say you savee Linee.\n\n\"Then you make bad talkee with Lajah Saffir at long-house.  Sing hear\nyou all timee.  You tly getee tleasure away from Dlyaks for your self.\nThen--\"\n\n\"Stop!\" roared von Horn.  \"Stop!  You lying yellow sneak, before I put\na bullet in you.\"\n\n\"Both of you may stop now,\" said Professor Maxon authoritatively.\n\"There have been charges made here that cannot go unnoticed.  Can you\nprove these things Sing?\" he asked turning to the Chinaman.\n\n\"I plove much by Bludleen's lascar.  Bludleen tell him all 'bout\nHornee.  I plove some more by Dyak chief at long-house.  He knows lots.\nLajah Saffir tell him.  It all tlue, Mlaxon.\"\n\n\"And it is true about this man--the thing that you have told us is\ntrue?  He is not one of those created in the laboratory?\"\n\n\"No, Mlaxon.  You no makee fine young man like Blulan--you know lat,\nMlaxon.  You makee One, Two, Thlee--all up to Twelve.  All fleaks.  You\nought to know, Mlaxon, lat you no can makee a Blulan.\"\n\nDuring these revelations Bulan had sat with his eyes fixed upon the\nChinaman.  There was a puzzled expression upon his wan, blood-streaked\nface.  It was as though he were trying to wrest from the inner temple\nof his consciousness a vague and tantalizing memory that eluded him\neach time that he felt he had it within his grasp--the key to the\nstrange riddle that hid his origin.\n\nThe girl kneeled close beside him, one small hand in his.  Hope and\nhappiness had supplanted the sorrow in her face.  She tore the hem from\nher skirt, to bandage the bloody furrow that creased the man's temple.\nProfessor Maxon stood silently by, watching the loving tenderness that\nmarked each deft, little movement of her strong, brown hands.\n\nThe revelations of the past few minutes had shocked the old man into\nstupefied silence.  It was difficult, almost impossible, for him to\nbelieve that Sing had spoken the truth and that this man was not one of\nthe creatures of his own creation; yet from the bottom of his heart he\nprayed that it might prove the truth, for he saw that his daughter\nloved the man with a love that would be stayed by no obstacle or bound\nby no man-made law, or social custom.\n\nThe Chinaman's indictment of von Horn had come as an added blow to\nProfessor Maxon, but it had brought its own supporting evidence in the\nflood of recollections it had induced in the professor's mind.  Now he\nrecalled a hundred chance incidents and conversations with his\nassistant that pointed squarely toward the man's disloyalty and\nvillainy.  He wondered that he had been so blind as not to have\nsuspected his lieutenant long before.\n\nVirginia had at last succeeded in adjusting her rude bandage and\nstopping the flow of blood.  Bulan had risen weakly to his feet.  The\ngirl supported him upon one side, and Sing upon the other.  Professor\nMaxon approached the little group.\n\n\"I do not know what to make of all that Sing has told us,\" he said.\n\"If you are not Number Thirteen who are you?  Where did you come from?\nIt seems very strange indeed--impossible, in fact.  However, if you\nwill explain who you are, I shall be glad\nto--ah--consider--ah--permitting you to pay court to my daughter.\"\n\n\"I do not know who I am,\" replied Bulan.  \"I had always thought that I\nwas only Number Thirteen, until Sing just spoke.  Now I have a faint\nrecollection of drifting for days upon the sea in an open boat--beyond\nthat all is blank.  I shall not force my attentions upon Virginia until\nI can prove my identity, and that my past is one which I can lay before\nher without shame--until then I shall not see her.\"\n\n\"You shall do nothing of the kind,\" cried the girl.  \"You love me, and\nI you.  My father intended to force me to marry you while he still\nthought that you were a soulless thing.  Now that it is quite apparent\nthat you are a human being, and a gentleman, he hesitates, but I do\nnot.  As I have told you before, it makes no difference to me what you\nare.  You have told me that you love me.  You have demonstrated a love\nthat is high, and noble, and self-sacrificing.  More than that no girl\nneeds to know.  I am satisfied to be the wife of Bulan--if Bulan is\nsatisfied to have the daughter of the man who has so cruelly wronged\nhim.\"\n\nAn arm went around the girl's shoulders and drew her close to the man\nshe had glorified with her loyalty and her love.  The other hand was\nstretched out toward Professor Maxon.\n\n\"Professor,\" said Bulan, \"in the face of what Sing has told us, in the\nface of a disinterested comparison between myself and the miserable\ncreatures of your experiments, is it not folly to suppose that I am one\nof them?  Some day I shall recall my past, until that time shall prove\nmy worthiness I shall not ask for Virginia's hand, and in this decision\nshe must concur, for the truth might reveal some insurmountable\nobstacle to our marriage.  In the meantime let us be friends,\nprofessor, for we are both actuated by the same desire--the welfare and\nhappiness of your daughter.\"\n\nThe old man stepped forward and took Bulan's hand.  The expression of\ndoubt and worry had left his face.\n\n\"I cannot believe,\" he said, \"that you are other than a gentleman, and\nif, in my desire to protect Virginia, I have said aught to wound you I\nask your forgiveness.\"\n\nBulan responded only with a tighter pressure of the hand.\n\n\"And now,\" said the professor, \"let us return to the long-house.  I\nwish to have a few words in private with you, von Horn,\" and he turned\nto face his assistant, but the man had disappeared.\n\n\"Where is Doctor von Horn?\" exclaimed the scientist, addressing Sing.\n\n\"Hornee, him vamoose long time 'go,\" replied the Chinaman.  \"He hear\nall he likee.\"\n\nSlowly the little party wound along the jungle trail, and in less than\na mile, to Virginia's infinite surprise, came out upon the river and\nthe long-house that she and Bulan had searched for in vain.\n\n\"And to think,\" she cried, \"that all these awful days we have been\nalmost within sound of your voices.  What strange freak of fate sent\nyou to us today?\"\n\n\"We had about given up hope,\" replied her father, \"when Sing suggested\nto me that we cut across the highlands that separate this valley from\nthe one adjoining it upon the northeast, where we should strike other\ntribes and from them glean some clue to your whereabouts in case your\nabductors had attempted to carry you back to the sea by another route.\nThis seemed likely in view of the fact that we were assured by enemies\nof Muda Saffir that you were not in his possession, and that the river\nwe were bound for would lead your captors most quickly out of the\ndomains of that rascally Malay.  You may imagine our surprise,\nVirginia, when after proceeding for but a mile we discovered you.\"\n\nNo sooner had the party entered the verandah of the long-house than\nProfessor Maxon made inquiries for von Horn, only to learn that he had\ndeparted up stream in a prahu with several warriors whom he had engaged\nto accompany him on a \"hunting expedition,\" having explained that the\nwhite girl had been found and was being brought to the long-house.\n\nThe chief further explained that he had done his best to dissuade the\nwhite man from so rash an act, as he was going directly into the\ncountry of the tribe of the two men he had killed, and there was little\nchance that he ever would come out alive.\n\nWhile they were still discussing von Horn's act, and wondering at his\nintentions, a native on the verandah cried out in astonishment,\npointing down the river.  As they looked in the direction he indicated\nall saw a graceful, white cutter gliding around a nearby turn.  At the\noars were white clad American sailors, and in the stern two officers in\nthe uniform of the United States navy.\n\n\n\n17\n\n999 PRISCILLA\n\n\nAs the cutter touched the bank the entire party from the long-house,\nwhites and natives, were gathered on the shore to meet it.  At first\nthe officers held off as though fearing a hostile demonstration, but\nwhen they saw the whites among the throng, a command was given to pull\nin, and a moment later one of the officers stepped ashore.\n\n\"I am Lieutenant May,\" he said, \"of the U.S.S. New Mexico, flagship of\nthe Pacific Fleet.  Have I the honor to address Professor Maxon?\"\n\nThe scientist nodded.  \"I am delighted,\" he said.\n\n\"We have been to your island, Professor,\" continued the officer, \"and\njudging from the evidences of hasty departure, and the corpses of\nseveral natives there, I feared that some harm had befallen you.  We\ntherefore cruised along the Bornean coast making inquiries of the\nnatives until at last we found one who had heard a rumor of a party of\nwhites being far in the interior searching for a white girl who had\nbeen stolen from them by pirates.\n\n\"The farther up this river we have come the greater our assurance that\nwe were on the right trail, for scarcely a native we interrogated but\nhad seen or heard of some of your party.  Mixed with the truth they\ntold us were strange tales of terrible monsters led by a gigantic white\nman.\"\n\n\"The imaginings of childish minds,\" said the professor.  \"However, why,\nmy dear lieutenant, did you honor me by visiting my island?\"\n\nThe officer hesitated a moment before answering, his eyes running about\nover the assembly as though in search of someone.\n\n\"Well, Professor Maxon, to be quite frank,\" he said at length, \"we\nlearned at Singapore the personnel of your party, which included a\nformer naval officer whom we have been seeking for many years.  We came\nto your island to arrest this man--I refer to Doctor Carl von Horn.\"\n\nWhen the lieutenant learned of the recent disappearance of the man he\nsought, he expressed his determination to push on at once in pursuit;\nand as Professor Maxon feared again to remain unprotected in the heart\nof the Bornean wilderness his entire party was taken aboard the cutter.\n\nA few miles up the river they came upon one of the Dyaks who had\naccompanied von Horn, a few hours earlier.  The warrior sat smoking\nbeside a beached prahu.  When interrogated he explained that von Horn\nand the balance of his crew had gone inland, leaving him to guard the\nboat.  He said that he thought he could guide them to the spot where\nthe white man might be found.\n\nProfessor Maxon and Sing accompanied one of the officers and a dozen\nsailors in the wake of the Dyak guide.  Virginia and Bulan remained in\nthe cutter, as the latter was still too weak to attempt the hard march\nthrough the jungle.  For an hour the party traversed the trail in the\nwake of von Horn and his savage companions.  They had come almost to\nthe spot when their ears were assailed by the weird and blood curdling\nyells of native warriors, and a moment later von Horn's escort dashed\ninto view in full retreat.\n\nAt sight of the white men they halted in relief, pointing back in the\ndirection they had come, and jabbering excitedly in their native\ntongue.  Warily the party advanced again behind these new guides; but\nwhen they reached the spot they sought, the cause of the Dyaks' panic\nhad fled, warned, doubtless, by their trained ears of the approach of\nan enemy.\n\nThe sight that met the eyes of the searchers told all of the story that\nthey needed to know.  A hole had been excavated in the ground,\npartially uncovering a heavy chest, and across this chest lay the\nheadless body of Doctor Carl von Horn.\n\nLieutenant May turned toward Professor Maxon with a questioning look.\n\n\"It is he,\" said the scientist.\n\n\"But the chest?\" inquired the officer.\n\n\"Mlaxon's tleasure,\" spoke up Sing Lee.  \"Hornee him tly steal it for\nlong time.\"\n\n\"Treasure!\" ejaculated the professor.  \"Bududreen gave up his life for\nthis.  Rajah Muda Saffir fought and intrigued and murdered for\npossession of it!  Poor, misguided von Horn has died for it, and left\nhis head to wither beneath the rafters of a Dyak long-house!  It is\nincredible.\"\n\n\"But, Professor Maxon,\" said Lieutenant May, \"men will suffer all these\nthings and more for gold.\"\n\n\"Gold!\" cried the professor.  \"Why, man, that is a box of books on\nbiology and eugenics.\"\n\n\"My God!\" exclaimed May, \"and von Horn was accredited to be one of the\nshrewdest swindlers and adventurers in America!  But come, we may as\nwell return to the cutter--my men will carry the chest.\"\n\n\"No!\" exclaimed Professor Maxon with a vehemence the other could not\nunderstand.  \"Let them bury it again where it lies.  It and what it\ncontains have been the cause of sufficient misery and suffering and\ncrime.  Let it lie where it is in the heart of savage Borneo, and pray\nto God that no man ever finds it, and that I shall forget forever that\nwhich is in it.\"\n\nOn the morning of the third day following the death of von Horn the New\nMexico steamed away from the coast of Borneo.  Upon her deck, looking\nback toward the verdure clad hills, stood Virginia and Bulan.\n\n\"Thank heaven,\" exclaimed the girl fervently, \"that we are leaving it\nbehind us forever.\"\n\n\"Amen,\" replied Bulan, \"but yet, had it not been for Borneo I might\nnever have found you.\"\n\n\"We should have met elsewhere then, Bulan,\" said the girl in a low\nvoice, \"for we were made for one another.  No power on earth could have\nkept us apart.  In your true guise you would have found me--I am sure\nof it.\"\n\n\"It is maddening, Virginia,\" said the man, \"to be constantly straining\nevery resource of my memory in futile endeavor to catch and hold one\nfleeting clue to my past.  Why, dear, do you realize that I may have\nbeen a fugitive from justice, as was von Horn, a vile criminal perhaps.\nIt is awful, Virginia, to contemplate the horrible possibilities of my\nlost past.\"\n\n\"No, Bulan, you could never have been a criminal,\" replied the loyal\ngirl, \"but there is one possibility that has been haunting me\nconstantly.  It frightens me just to think of it--it is,\" and the girl\nlowered her voice as though she feared to say the thing she dreaded\nmost, \"it is that you may have loved another--that--that you may even\nbe married.\"\n\nBulan was about to laugh away any such fears when the gravity and\nimportance of the possibility impressed him quite as fully as it had\nVirginia.  He saw that it was not at all unlikely that he was already a\nmarried man; and he saw too what the girl now acknowledged, that they\nmight never wed until the mystery of his past had been cleared away.\n\n\"There is something that gives weight to my fear,\" continued Virginia,\n\"something that I had almost forgotten in the rush and excitement of\nevents during the past few days.  During your delirium your ravings\nwere, for the most part, quite incoherent, but there was one name that\nyou repeated many times--a woman's name, preceded by a number.  It was\n'Nine ninety nine Priscilla.'  Maybe she--\"\n\nBut Virginia got no further.  With a low exclamation of delight Bulan\ncaught her in his arms.\n\n\"It is all right, dear,\" he cried.  \"It is all right.  Everything has\ncome back to me now.  You have given me the clue.  Nine ninety nine\nPriscilla is my father's address--Nine ninety nine Priscilla Avenue.\n\n\"I am Townsend J. Harper, Jr.  You have heard of my father.  Every one\nhas since he commenced consolidating interurban traction companies.\nAnd I'm not married, Virginia, and never have been; but I shall be if\nthis miserable old mud scow ever reaches Singapore.\"\n\n\"Oh, Bulan,\" cried the girl, \"how in the world did you ever happen to\ncome to that terrible island of ours?\"\n\n\"I came for you, dear,\" he replied.  \"It is a long story.  After dinner\nI will tell you all of it that I can recall.  For the present it must\nsuffice you to know that I followed you from the railway station at\nIthaca half around the world for a love that had been born from a\nsingle glance at your sweet face as you passed me to enter your Pullman.\n\n\"On my father's yacht I reached your island after trailing you to\nSingapore.  It was a long and tedious hunt and we followed many blind\nleads, but at last we came off an island upon which natives had told us\nsuch a party as yours was living.  Five of us put off in a boat to\nexplore--that is the last that I can recall.  Sing says he found me\nalone in a row boat, a 'dummy.'\"\n\nVirginia sighed, and crept closer to him.\n\n\"You may be the son of the great Townsend J. Harper, you have been the\nsoulless Number Thirteen; but to me you will always be Bulan, for it\nwas Bulan whom I learned to love.\""
