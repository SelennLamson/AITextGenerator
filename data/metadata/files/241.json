 "text": "CLOTELLE; OR, THE COLORED HEROINE.\n\nA TALE OF THE SOUTHERN STATES.\n\n\nBy William Wells Brown\n\n\n\n\n\nCLOTELLE\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. THE SOUTHERN SOCIAL CIRCLE\n\n\nFOR many years the South has been noted for its beautiful Quadroon\nwomen. Bottles of ink, and reams of paper, have been used to portray the\n“finely-cut and well-moulded features,” the “silken curls,” the “dark\nand brilliant eyes,” the “splendid forms,” the “fascinating smiles,” and\n“accomplished manners” of these impassioned and voluptuous daughters of\nthe two races,--the unlawful product of the crime of human bondage. When\nwe take into consideration the fact that no safeguard was ever thrown\naround virtue, and no inducement held out to slave-women to be pure and\nchaste, we will not be surprised when told that immorality pervades\nthe domestic circle in the cities and towns of the South to an extent\nunknown in the Northern States. Many a planter's wife has dragged out\na miserable existence, with an aching heart, at seeing her place in the\nhusband's affections usurped by the unadorned beauty and captivating\nsmiles of her waiting-maid. Indeed, the greater portion of the colored\nwomen, in the days of slavery, had no greater aspiration than that of\nbecoming the finely-dressed mistress of some white man. At the negro\nballs and parties, that used to be so frequently given, this class of\nwomen generally made the most splendid appearance.\n\nA few years ago, among the many slave-women of Richmond, Va., who hired\ntheir time of their masters, was Agnes, a mulatto owned by John Graves,\nEsq., and who might be heard boasting that she was the daughter of an\nAmerican Senator. Although nearly forty years of age at the time of\nwhich we write, Agnes was still exceedingly handsome. More than half\nwhite, with long black hair and deep blue eyes, no one felt like\ndisputing with her when she urged her claim to her relationship with\nthe Anglo-Saxon. In her younger days, Agnes had been a housekeeper for\na young slave-holder, and in sustaining this relation had become the\nmother of two daughters. After being cast aside by this young man,\nthe slave-woman betook herself to the business of a laundress, and was\nconsidered to be the most tasteful woman in Richmond at her vocation.\n\nIsabella and Marion, the two daughters of Agnes, resided with their\nmother, and gave her what aid they could in her business. The mother,\nhowever, was very choice of her daughters, and would allow them to\nperform no labor that would militate against their lady-like appearance.\nAgnes early resolved to bring up her daughters as ladies, as she termed\nit.\n\nAs the girls grew older, the mother had to pay a stipulated price for\nthem per month. Her notoriety as a laundress of the first class enabled\nher to put an extra charge upon the linen that passed through her hands;\nand although she imposed little or no work upon her daughters, she was\nenabled to live in comparative luxury and have her daughters dressed to\nattract attention, especially at the negro balls and parties.\n\nAlthough the term “negro ball” is applied to these gatherings, yet a\nlarge portion of the men who attend them are whites. Negro balls and\nparties in the Southern States, especially in the cities and towns, are\nusually made up of quadroon women, a few negro men, and any number of\nwhite gentlemen. These are gatherings of the most democratic character.\nBankers, merchants, lawyers, doctors, and their clerks and students, all\ntake part in these social assemblies upon terms of perfect equality. The\nfather and son not unfrequently meet and dance _vis a vis_ at a negro\nball.\n\nIt was at one of these parties that Henry Linwood, the son of a wealthy\nand retired gentleman of Richmond, was first introduced to Isabella, the\noldest daughter of Agnes. The young man had just returned from Harvard\nCollege, where he had spent the previous five years. Isabella was in\nher eighteenth year, and was admitted by all who knew her to be the\nhandsomest girl, colored or white, in the city. On this occasion, she\nwas attired in a sky-blue silk dress, with deep black lace flounces,\nand bertha of the same. On her well-moulded arms she wore massive gold\nbracelets, while her rich black hair was arranged at the back in broad\nbasket plaits, ornamented with pearls, and the front in the French style\n(_a la Imperatrice_), which suited her classic face to perfection.\n\nMarion was scarcely less richly dressed than her sister.\n\nHenry Linwood paid great attention to Isabella, which was looked\nupon with gratification by her mother, and became a matter of general\nconversation with all present. Of course, the young man escorted the\nbeautiful quadroon home that evening, and became the favorite visitor at\nthe house of Agnes.\n\nIt was on a beautiful moonlight night in the month of August, when all\nwho reside in tropical climates are eagerly gasping for a breath of\nfresh air, that Henry Linwood was in the garden which surrounded Agnes'\ncottage, with the young quadroon at his side. He drew from his pocket a\nnewspaper wet from the press, and read the following advertisement:--\n\n     NOTICE.--Seventy-nine negroes will be offered for sale\n     on Monday, September 10, at 12 o'clock, being the entire\n     stock of the late John Graves.  The negroes are in excellent\n     condition, and all warranted against the common vices.\n     Among them are several mechanics, able-bodied field-hands,\n     plough-boys, and women with children, some of them very prolific,\n     affording a rare opportunity for any one who wishes to raise\n     a strong and healthy lot of servants for their own use.\n     Also several mulatto girls of rare personal qualities,--\n     two of these very superior.\n\nAmong the above slaves advertised for sale were Agnes and her two\ndaughters. Ere young Linwood left the quadroon that evening, he promised\nher that he would become her purchaser, and make her free and her own\nmistress.\n\nMr. Graves had long been considered not only an excellent and upright\ncitizen of the first standing among the whites, but even the slaves\nregarded him as one of the kindest of masters. Having inherited his\nslaves with the rest of his property, he became possessed of them\nwithout any consultation or wish of his own. He would neither buy nor\nsell slaves, and was exceedingly careful, in letting them out, that they\ndid not find oppressive and tyrannical masters. No slave speculator ever\ndared to cross the threshold of this planter of the Old Dominion. He\nwas a constant attendant upon religious worship, and was noted for his\ngeneral benevolence. The American Bible Society, the American Tract\nSociety, and the cause of the Foreign Missions, found in him a liberal\nfriend. He was always anxious that his slaves should appear well on the\nSabbath, and have an opportunity of hearing the word of God.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. THE NEGRO SALE\n\n\nAS might have been expected, the day of sale brought an unusually large\nnumber together to compete for the property to be sold. Farmers, who\nmake a business of raising slaves for the market, were there, and\nslave-traders, who make a business of buying human beings in the\nslave-raising States and taking them to the far South, were also in\nattendance. Men and women, too, who wished to purchase for their own\nuse, had found their way to the slave sale.\n\nIn the midst of the throng was one who felt a deeper interest in the\nresult of the sale than any other of the bystanders. This was young\nLinwood. True to his promise, he was there with a blank bank-check in\nhis pocket, awaiting with impatience to enter the list as a bidder for\nthe beautiful slave.\n\nIt was indeed a heart-rending scene to witness the lamentations of these\nslaves, all of whom had grown up together on the old homestead of Mr.\nGraves, and who had been treated with great kindness by that gentleman,\nduring his life. Now they were to be separated, and form new relations\nand companions. Such is the precarious condition of the slave. Even\nwhen with a good master, there is not certainty of his happiness in the\nfuture.\n\nThe less valuable slaves were first placed upon the auction-block, one\nafter another, and sold to the highest bidder. Husbands and wives were\nseparated with a degree of indifference that is unknown in any other\nrelation in life. Brothers and sisters were torn from each other, and\nmothers saw their children for the last time on earth.\n\nIt was late in the day, and when the greatest number of persons were\nthought to be present, when Agnes and her daughters were brought out to\nthe place of sale. The mother was first put upon the auction-block, and\nsold to a noted negro trader named Jennings. Marion was next ordered to\nascend the stand, which she did with a trembling step, and was sold for\n$1200.\n\nAll eyes were now turned on Isabella, as she was led forward by the\nauctioneer. The appearance of the handsome quadroon caused a deep\nsensation among the crowd. There she stood, with a skin as fair as most\nwhite women, her features as beautifully regular as any of her sex\nof pure Anglo-Saxon blood, her long black hair done up in the neatest\nmanner, her form tall and graceful, and her whole appearance indicating\none superior to her condition.\n\nThe auctioneer commenced by saying that Miss Isabella was fit to deck\nthe drawing-room of the finest mansion in Virginia.\n\n“How much, gentlemen, for this real Albino!--fit fancy-girl for any one!\nShe enjoys good health, and has a sweet temper. How much do you say?”\n\n“Five hundred dollars.”\n\n“Only five hundred for such a girl as this? Gentlemen, she is worth\na deal more than that sum. You certainly do not know the value of the\narticle you are bidding on. Here, gentlemen, I hold in my hand a paper\ncertifying that she has a good moral character.”\n\n“Seven hundred.”\n\n“Ah, gentlemen, that is something life. This paper also states that she\nis very intelligent.”\n\n“Eight hundred.”\n\n“She was first sprinkled, then immersed, and is now warranted to be a\ndevoted Christian, and perfectly trustworthy.”\n\n“Nine hundred dollars.”\n\n“Nine hundred and fifty.”\n\n“One thousand.”\n\n“Eleven hundred.”\n\nHere the bidding came to a dead stand. The auctioneer stopped, looked\naround, and began in a rough manner to relate some anecdote connected\nwith the sale of slaves, which he said had come under his own\nobservation.\n\nAt this juncture the scene was indeed a most striking one. The laughing,\njoking, swearing, smoking, spitting, and talking, kept up a continual\nhum and confusion among the crowd, while the slave-girl stood with\ntearful eyes, looking alternately at her mother and sister and toward\nthe young man whom she hoped would become her purchaser.\n\n“The chastity of this girl,” now continued the auctioneer, “is pure.\nShe has never been from under her mother's care. She is virtuous, and as\ngentle as a dove.”\n\nThe bids here took a fresh start, and went on until $1800 was reached.\nThe auctioneer once more resorted to his jokes, and concluded by\nassuring the company that Isabella was not only pious, but that she\ncould make an excellent prayer.\n\n“Nineteen hundred dollars.”\n\n“Two thousand.”\n\nThis was the last bid, and the quadroon girl was struck off, and became\nthe property of Henry Linwood.\n\nThis was a Virginia slave-auction, at which the bones, sinews, blood,\nand nerves of a young girl of eighteen were sold for $500; her moral\ncharacter for $200; her superior intellect for $100; the benefits\nsupposed to accrue from her having been sprinkled and immersed, together\nwith a warranty of her devoted Christianity, for $300; her ability to\nmake a good prayer for $200; and her chastity for $700 more. This, too,\nin a city thronged with churches, whose tall spires look like so many\nsignals pointing to heaven, but whose ministers preach that slavery is a\nGod-ordained institution!\n\nThe slaves were speedily separated, and taken along by their respective\nmasters. Jennings, the slave-speculator, who had purchased Agnes and\nher daughter Marion, with several of the other slaves, took them to the\ncounty prison, where he usually kept his human cattle after purchasing\nthem, previous to starting for the New Orleans market.\n\nLinwood had already provided a place for Isabella, to which she was\ntaken. The most trying moment for her was when she took leave of her\nmother and sister. The “Good-by” of the slave is unlike that of any\nother class in the community. It is indeed a farewell forever. With\ntears streaming down their cheeks, they embraced and commended each\nother to God, who is no respecter of persons, and before whom master and\nslave must one day appear.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. THE SLAVE-SPECULATOR\n\n\nDICK JENNINGS the slave-speculator, was one of the few Northern men, who\ngo to the South and throw aside their honest mode of obtaining a living\nand resort to trading in human beings. A more repulsive-looking person\ncould scarcely be found in any community of bad looking men. Tall, lean\nand lank, with high cheek-bones, face much pitted with the small-pox,\ngray eyes with red eyebrows, and sandy whiskers, he indeed stood alone\nwithout mate or fellow in looks. Jennings prided himself upon what he\ncalled his goodness of heat, and was always speaking of his humanity. As\nmany of the slaves whom he intended taking to the New Orleans market had\nbeen raised in Richmond, and had relations there, he determined to leave\nthe city early in the morning, so as not to witness any of the scenes\nso common on the departure of a slave-gang to the far South. In this, he\nwas most successful; for not even Isabella, who had called at the prison\nseveral times to see her mother and sister, was aware of the time that\nthey were to leave.\n\nThe slave-trader started at early dawn, and was beyond the confines of\nthe city long before the citizens were out of their beds. As a slave\nregards a life on the sugar, cotton, or rice plantation as even worse\nthan death, they are ever on the watch for an opportunity to escape. The\ntrader, aware of this, secures his victims in chains before he sets out\non his journey. On this occasion, Jennings had the men chained in pairs,\nwhile the women were allowed to go unfastened, but were closely watched.\n\nAfter a march of eight days, the company arrived on the banks of\nthe Ohio River, where they took a steamer for the place of their\ndestination. Jennings had already advertised in the New Orleans papers,\nthat he would be there with a prime lot of able-bodied slaves, men\nand women, fit for field-service, with a few extra ones calculated for\nhouse-servants,--all between the ages of fifteen and twenty-five years;\nbut like most men who make a business of speculating in human beings, he\noften bought many who were far advanced in years, and would try to pass\nthem off for five or six years younger than they were. Few persons\ncan arrive at anything approaching the real age of the negro, by mere\nobservation, unless they are well acquainted with the race. Therefore,\nthe slave-trader frequently carried out the deception with perfect\nimpunity.\n\nAfter the steamer had left the wharf and was fairly out on the bosom of\nthe broad Mississippi, the speculator called his servant Pompey to him;\nand instructed him as to getting the negroes ready for market. Among\nthe forty slaves that the trader had on this occasion, were some whose\nappearance indicated that they had seen some years and had gone through\nconsiderable service. Their gray hair and whiskers at once pronounced\nthem to be above the ages set down in the trader's advertisement. Pompey\nhad long been with Jennings, and understood his business well, and if\nhe did not take delight in the discharge of his duty, he did it at least\nwith a degree of alacrity, so that he might receive the approbation of\nhis master.\n\nPomp, as he was usually called by the trader, was of real negro blood,\nand would often say, when alluding to himself, “Dis nigger am no\ncounterfeit, he is de ginuine artikle. Dis chile is none of your\nhaf-and-haf, dere is no bogus about him.”\n\nPompey was of low stature, round face, and, like most of his race, had\na set of teeth, which, for whiteness and beauty, could not be surpassed;\nhis eyes were large, lips thick, and hair short and woolly. Pompey had\nbeen with Jennings so long, and had seen so much of buying and selling\nof his fellow-creatures, that he appeared perfectly indifferent to the\nheart-rending scenes which daily occurred in his presence. Such is the\nforce of habit:--\n\n      “Vice is a monster of such frightful mien,\n      That to be hated, needs but to be seen;\n      But seen too oft, familiar with its face,\n      We first endure, then pity, then embrace.”\n\nIt was on the second day of the steamer's voyage, that Pompey selected\nfive of the oldest slaves, took them into a room by themselves, and\ncommenced preparing them for the market.\n\n“Now,” said he, addressing himself to the company, “I is de chap dat is\nto get you ready for de Orleans market, so dat you will bring marser a\ngood price. How old is you?” addressing himself to a man not less than\nforty.\n\n“If I live to see next sweet-potato-digging time, I shall be either\nforty or forty-five, I don't know which.”\n\n“Dat may be,” replied Pompey; “but now you is only thirty years\nold,--dat's what marser says you is to be.”\n\n“I know I is more den dat,” responded the man.\n\n“I can't help nuffin' about dat,” returned Pompey; “but when you get\ninto de market and any one ax you how old you is, and you tell um you is\nforty or forty-five, marser will tie you up and cut you all to pieces.\nBut if you tell um dat you is only thirty, den he won't. Now remember\ndat you is thirty years old and no more.”\n\n“Well den, I guess I will only be thirty when dey ax me.”\n\n“What's your name?” said Pompey, addressing himself to another.\n\n“Jeems.”\n\n“Oh! Uncle Jim, is it?” “Yes.”\n\n“Den you must have all them gray whiskers shaved off, and all dem gray\nhairs plucked out of your head.” This was all said by Pompey in a manner\nwhich showed that he knew what he was about.\n\n“How old is you?” asked Pompey of a tall, strong-looking man. “What's\nyour name?”\n\n“I am twenty-nine years old, and my name is Tobias, but they calls me\nToby.”\n\n“Well, Toby, or Mr. Tobias, if dat will suit you better, you are now\ntwenty-three years old; dat's all,--do you understand dat?”\n\n“Yes,” replied Toby.\n\nPompey now gave them all to understand how old they were to be when\nasked by persons who were likely to purchase, and then went and reported\nto his master that the old boys were all right.\n\n“Be sure,” said Jennings, “that the niggers don't forget what you have\ntaught them, for our luck this time in the market depends upon their\nappearance. If any of them have so many gray hairs that you cannot pluck\nthem out, take the blacking and brush, and go at them.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. THE BOAT-RACE\n\n\nAT eight o'clock, on the evening of the third day of the passage, the\nlights of another steamer were seen in the distance, and apparently\ncoming up very fast. This was the signal for a general commotion on\nboard the Patriot, and everything indicated that a steamboat-race was\nat hand. Nothing can exceed the excitement attendant upon the racing of\nsteamers on the Mississippi.\n\nBy the time the boats had reached Memphis they were side by side, and\neach exerting itself to get in advance of the other. The night was\nclear, the moon shining brightly, and the boats so near to each other\nthat the passengers were within speaking distance. On board the Patriot\nthe firemen were using oil, lard, butter, and even bacon, with wood, for\nthe purpose of raising the steam to its highest pitch. The blaze mingled\nwith the black smoke that issued from the pipes of the other boat, which\nshowed that she also was burning something more combustible than wood.\n\nThe firemen of both boats, who were slaves, were singing songs such\nas can only be heard on board a Southern steamer. The boats now came\nabreast of each other, and nearer and nearer, until they were locked\nso that men could pass from one to the other. The wildest excitement\nprevailed among the men employed on the steamers, in which the\npassengers freely participated.\n\nThe Patriot now stopped to take in passengers, but still no steam was\npermitted to escape. On the starting of the boat again, cold water\nwas forced into the boilers by the feed-pumps, and, as might have been\nexpected, one of the boilers exploded with terrific force, carrying away\nthe boiler-deck and tearing to pieces much of the machinery. One dense\nfog of steam filled every part of the vessel, while shrieks, groans,\nand cries were heard on every side. Men were running hither and thither\nlooking for their wives, and women were flying about in the wildest\nconfusion seeking for their husbands. Dismay appeared on every\ncountenance.\n\nThe saloons and cabins soon looked more like hospitals than anything\nelse; but by this time the Patriot had drifted to the shore, and the\nother steamer had come alongside to render assistance to the disabled\nboat. The killed and wounded (nineteen in number) were put on shore,\nand the Patriot, taken in tow by the Washington, was once more on her\njourney.\n\nIt was half-past twelve, and the passengers, instead of retiring to\ntheir berths, once more assembled at the gambling-tables. The practice\nof gambling on the western waters has long been a source of annoyance\nto the more moral persons who travel on our great rivers. Thousands\nof dollars often change owners during a passage from St. Louis or\nLouisville to New Orleans, on a Mississippi steamer. Many men\nare completely ruined on such occasions, and duels are often the\nconsequence.\n\n“Go call my boy, steward,” said Mr. Jones, as he took his cards one by\none from the table.\n\nIn a few minutes a fine-looking, bright-eyed mulatto boy, apparently\nabout sixteen years of age, was standing by his master's side at the\ntable.\n\n“I am broke, all but my boy,” said Jones, as he ran his fingers through\nhis cards; “but he is worth a thousand dollars, and I will bet the half\nof him.”\n\n“I will call you,” said Thompson, as he laid five hundred dollars at\nthe feet of the boy, who was standing on the table, and at the same time\nthrowing down his cards before his adversary.\n\n“You have beaten me,” said Jones; and a roar of laughter followed from\nthe other gentleman as poor Joe stepped down from the table.\n\n“Well, I suppose I owe you half the nigger,” said Thompson, as he took\nhold of Joe and began examining his limbs.\n\n“Yes,” replied Jones, “he is half yours. Let me have five hundred\ndollars, and I will give you a bill of sale of the boy.”\n\n“Go back to your bed,” said Thompson to his chattel, “and remember that\nyou now belong to me.”\n\nThe poor slave wiped the tears from his eyes, as, in obedience, he\nturned to leave the table.\n\n“My father gave me that boy,” said Jones, as he took the money, “and I\nhope, Mr. Thompson, that you will allow me to redeem him.”\n\n“Most certainly, sir,” replied Thompson. “Whenever you hand over the\ncool thousand the negro is yours.”\n\nNext morning, as the passengers were assembling in the cabin and on\ndeck, and while the slaves were running about waiting on or looking for\ntheir masters, poor Joe was seen entering his new master's stateroom,\nboots in hand.\n\n“Who do you belong to?” inquired a gentleman of an old negro, who passed\nalong leading a fine Newfoundland dog which he had been feeding.\n\n“When I went to sleep las' night,” replied the slave, “I 'longed to\nMassa Carr; but he bin gamblin' all night, an' I don't know who I 'longs\nto dis mornin'.”\n\nSuch is the uncertainty of a slave's life. He goes to bed at night\nthe pampered servant of his young master, with whom he has played\nin childhood, and who would not see his slave abused under any\nconsideration, and gets up in the morning the property of a man whom he\nhas never before seen.\n\nTo behold five or six tables in the saloon of a steamer, with half a\ndozen men playing cards at each, with money, pistols, and bowie-knives\nspread in splendid confusion before them, is an ordinary thing on the\nMississippi River.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. THE YOUNG MOTHER\n\n\nON the fourth morning, the Patriot landed at Grand Gulf, a beautiful\ntown on the left bank of the Mississippi. Among the numerous passengers\nwho came on board at Rodney was another slave-trader, with nine human\nchattels which he was conveying to the Southern market. The passengers,\nboth ladies and gentlemen, were startled at seeing among the new lot\nof slaves a woman so white as not to be distinguishable from the other\nwhite women on board. She had in her arms a child so white that no one\nwould suppose a drop of African blood flowed through its blue veins.\n\nNo one could behold that mother with her helpless babe, without feeling\nthat God would punish the oppressor. There she sat, with an expressive\nand intellectual forehead, and a countenance full of dignity and\nheroism, her dark golden locks rolled back from her almost snow-white\nforehead and floating over her swelling bosom. The tears that stood in\nher mild blue eyes showed that she was brooding over sorrows and wrongs\nthat filled her bleeding heart.\n\nThe hearts of the passers-by grew softer, while gazing upon that young\nmother as she pressed sweet kisses on the sad, smiling lips of the\ninfant that lay in her lap. The small, dimpled hands of the innocent\ncreature were slyly hid in the warm bosom on which the little one\nnestled. The blood of some proud Southerner, no doubt, flowed through\nthe veins of that child.\n\nWhen the boat arrived at Natches, a rather good-looking,\ngenteel-appearing man came on board to purchase a servant. This\nindividual introduced himself to Jennings as the Rev. James Wilson. The\nslave-trader conducted the preacher to the deck-cabin, where he kept\nhis slaves, and the man of God, after having some questions answered,\nselected Agnes as the one best suited to his service.\n\nIt seemed as if poor Marion's heart would break when she found that she\nwas to be separated from her mother. The preacher, however, appeared to\nbe but little moved by their sorrow, and took his newly-purchased victim\non shore. Agnes begged him to buy her daughter, but he refused, on the\nground that he had no use for her.\n\nDuring the remainder of the passage, Marion wept bitterly.\n\nAfter a run of a few hours, the boat stopped at Baton Rouge, where an\nadditional number of passengers were taken on board, among whom were\na number of persons who had been attending the races at that place.\nGambling and drinking were now the order of the day.\n\nThe next morning, at ten o'clock, the boat arrived at new Orleans, where\nthe passengers went to their hotels and homes, and the negroes to the\nslave-pens.\n\nLizzie, the white slave-mother, of whom we have already spoken, created\nas much of a sensation by the fairness of her complexion and the\nalabaster whiteness of her child, when being conveyed on shore at New\nOrleans, as she had done when brought on board at Grand Gulf. Every one\nthat saw her felt that slavery in the Southern States was not confined\nto the negro. Many had been taught to think that slavery was a benefit\nrather than an injury, and those who were not opposed to the institution\nbefore, now felt that if whites were to become its victims, it was time\nat least that some security should be thrown around the Anglo-Saxon to\nsave him from this servile and degraded position.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. THE SLAVE-MARKET.\n\nNOT far from Canal Street, in the city of New Orleans, stands a large\ntwo-story, flat building, surrounded by a stone wall some twelve feet\nhigh, the top of which is covered with bits of glass, and so constructed\nas to prevent even the possibility of any one's passing over it without\nsustaining great injury. Many of the rooms in this building resemble the\ncells of a prison, and in a small apartment near the “office” are to\nbe seen any number of iron collars, hobbles, handcuffs, thumbscrews,\ncowhides, chains, gags, and yokes.\n\nA back-yard, enclosed by a high wall, looks something like the\nplayground attached to one of our large New England schools, in which\nare rows of benches and swings. Attached to the back premises is a\ngood-sized kitchen, where, at the time of which we write, two old\nnegresses were at work, stewing, boiling, and baking, and occasionally\nwiping the perspiration from their furrowed and swarthy brows.\n\nThe slave-trader, Jennings, on his arrival at New Orleans, took up his\nquarters here with his gang of human cattle, and the morning after,\nat 10 o'clock, they were exhibited for sale. First of all came the\nbeautiful Marion, whose pale countenance and dejected look told how\nmany sad hours she had passed since parting with her mother at Natchez.\nThere, too, was a poor woman who had been separated from her husband;\nand another woman, whose looks and manners were expressive of deep\nanguish, sat by her side. There was “Uncle Jeems,” with his whiskers\noff, his face shaven clean, and the gray hairs plucked out, ready to be\nsold for ten years younger than he was. Toby was also there, with his\nface shaven and greased, ready for inspection.\n\nThe examination commenced, and was carried on in such a manner as to\nshock the feelings of any one not entirely devoid of the milk of human\nkindness.\n\n“What are you wiping your eyes for?” inquired a far, red-faced man, with\na white hat set on one side of his head and a cigar in his mouth, of a\nwoman who sat on one of the benches.\n\n“Because I left my man behind.”\n\n“Oh, if I buy you, I will furnish you with a better man than you left.\nI've got lots of young bucks on my farm.”\n\n“I don't want and never will have another man,” replied the woman.\n\n“What's you name?” asked a man in a straw hat of a tall negro who stood\nwith his arms folded across his breast, leaning against the wall.\n\n“My name is Aaron, sar.”\n\n“How old are you?”\n\n“Twenty-five.”\n\n“Where were you raised?”\n\n“In old Virginny, sar.”\n\n“How many men have owned you?”\n\n“Four.”\n\n“Do you enjoy good health?”\n\n“Yes, sar.”\n\n“How long did you live with your first owner?”\n\n“Twenty years.”\n\n“Did you ever run away?”\n\n“No, sar.”\n\n“Did you ever strike your master?”\n\n“No, sar.”\n\n“Were you ever whipped much?”\n\n“No, sar; I s'pose I didn't desarve it, sar.”\n\n“How long did you live with your second master?”\n\n“Ten years, sar.”\n\n“Have you a good appetite?”\n\n“Yes, sar.”\n\n“Can you eat your allowance?”\n\n“Yes, sar,--when I can get it.”\n\n“Where were you employed in Virginia?”\n\n“I worked de tobacker fiel'.”\n\n“In the tobacco field, eh?”\n\n“Yes, sar.”\n\n“How old did you say you was?”\n\n“Twenty-five, sar, nex' sweet-'tater-diggin' time.”\n\n“I am a cotton-planter, and if I buy you, you will have to work in the\ncotton-field. My men pick one hundred and fifty pounds a day, and the\nwomen one hundred and forty pounds; and those who fail to perform their\ntask receive five stripes for each pound that is wanting. Now, do you\nthink you could keep up with the rest of the hands?”\n\n“I don't know, sar, but I 'specs I'd have to.”\n\n“How long did you live with your third master?”\n\n“Three years, sar.”\n\n“Why, that makes you thirty-three. I thought you told me you were only\ntwenty-five?”\n\nAaron now looked first at the planter, then at the trader, and seemed\nperfectly bewildered. He had forgotten the lesson given him by Pompey\nrelative to his age; and the planter's circuitous questions--doubtless\nto find out the slave's real age--had thrown the negro off his guard.\n\n“I must see you back, so as to know how much you have been whipped,\nbefore I think of buying.”\n\nPompey, who had been standing by during the examination, thought that\nhis services were now required, and, stepping forth with a degree of\nofficiousness, said to Aaron,--\n\n“Don't you hear de gemman tell you he wants to 'zamin you. Cum,\nunharness yo'seff, ole boy, and don't be standin' dar.”\n\nAaron was soon examined, and pronounced “sound;” yet the conflicting\nstatement about his age was not satisfactory.\n\nFortunately for Marion, she was spared the pain of undergoing such an\nexamination. Mr. Cardney, a teller in one of the banks, had just been\nmarried, and wanted a maid-servant for his wife, and, passing through\nthe market in the early part of the day, was pleased with the young\nslave's appearance, and his dwelling the quadroon found a much better\nhome than often falls to the lot of a slave sold in the New Orleans\nmarket.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. THE SLAVE-HOLDING PARSON\n\n\nTHE Rev. James Wilson was a native of the State of Connecticut, where\nhe was educated for the ministry in the Methodist persuasion. His father\nwas a strict follower of John Wesley, and spared no pains in his son's\neducation, with the hope that he would one day be as renowned as the\nleader of his sect. James had scarcely finished his education at New\nHaven, when he was invited by an uncle, then on a visit to his father,\nto spend a few months at Natchez in Mississippi. Young Wilson accepted\nhis uncle's invitation, and accompanied him to the South. Few young men,\nand especially clergymen, going fresh from college to the South, but are\nlooked upon as geniuses in a small way, and who are not invited to all\nthe parties in the neighborhood. Mr. Wilson was not an exception to this\nrule. The society into which he was thrown, on his arrival at Natchez,\nwas too brilliant for him not to be captivated by it, and, as might have\nbeen expected, he succeeded in captivating a plantation with seventy\nslaves if not the heart of the lady to whom it belonged.\n\nAdded to this, he became a popular preacher, and had a large\ncongregation with a snug salary. Like other planters, Mr. Wilson\nconfided the care of his farm to Ned Huckelby, an overseer of high\nreputation in his way.\n\nThe Poplar Farm, as it was called, was situated in a beautiful valley,\nnine miles from Natchez, and near the Mississippi River. The once\nunshorn face of nature had given way, and the farm now blossomed with\na splendid harvest. The neat cottage stood in a grove, where Lombardy\npoplars lift their tops almost to prop the skies, where the willow,\nlocust, and horse-chestnut trees spread forth their branches, and\nflowers never ceased to blossom.\n\nThis was the parson's country residence, where the family spent only two\nmonths during the year. His town residence was a fine villa, seated on\nthe brow of a hill, at the edge of the city.\n\nIt was in the kitchen of this house that Agnes found her new home. Mr.\nWilson was every inch a democrat, and early resolved that “his people,”\n as he called his slaves, should be well-fed and not over-worked, and\ntherefore laid down the law and gospel to the overseer as well as to the\nslaves. “It is my wish,” said he to Mr. Carlingham, an old school-fellow\nwho was spending a few days with him,--“It is my wish that a new system\nbe adopted on the plantations in this State. I believe that the sons of\nHam should have the gospel, and I intend that mine shall have it. The\ngospel is calculated to make mankind better and none should be without\nit.”\n\n“What say you,” said Carlingham, “about the right of man to his\nliberty?”\n\n“Now, Carlingham, you have begun to harp again about men's rights. I\nreally wish that you could see this matter as I do.”\n\n“I regret that I cannot see eye to eye with you,” said Carlingham. “I\nam a disciple of Rousseau, and have for years made the rights of man my\nstudy, and I must confess to you that I see no difference between white\nand black, as it regards liberty.”\n\n“Now, my dear Carlingham, would you really have the negroes enjoy the\nsame rights as ourselves?”\n\n“I would most certainly. Look at our great Declaration of Independence!\nlook even at the Constitution of our own Connecticut, and see what is\nsaid in these about liberty.” “I regard all this talk about rights as\nmere humbug. The Bible is older than the Declaration of Independence,\nand there I take my stand.”\n\nA long discussion followed, in which both gentlemen put forth their\npeculiar ideas with much warmth of feeling.\n\nDuring this conversation, there was another person in the room, seated\nby the window, who, although at work, embroidering a fine collar, paid\nminute attention to what was said. This was Georgiana, the only daughter\nof the parson, who had but just returned from Connecticut, where she had\nfinished her education. She had had the opportunity of contrasting the\nspirit of Christianity and liberty in New England with that of slavery\nin her native State, and had learned to feel deeply for the injured\nnegro.\n\nGeorgiana was in her nineteenth year, and had been much benefited by her\nresidence of five years at the North. Her form was tall and graceful,\nher features regular and well-defined, and her complexion was\nilluminated by the freshness of youth, beauty, and health.\n\nThe daughter differed from both the father and visitor upon the subject\nwhich they had been discussing; and as soon as an opportunity offered,\nshe gave it as her opinion that the Bible was both the bulwark of\nChristianity and of liberty. With a smile she said,--\n\n“Of course, papa will overlook my difference with him, for although I am\na native of the South, I am by education and sympathy a Northerner.”\n\nMr. Wilson laughed, appearing rather pleased than otherwise at the\nmanner in which his daughter had expressed herself. From this Georgiana\ntook courage and continued,--\n\n“'Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.' This single passage of\nScripture should cause us to have respect for the rights of the slave.\nTrue Christian love is of an enlarged and disinterested nature. It loves\nall who love the Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity, without regard to color\nor condition.”\n\n“Georgiana, my dear, you are an abolitionist,--your talk is fanaticism!”\n said Mr. Wilson, in rather a sharp tone; but the subdued look of the\ngirl and the presence of Carlingham caused him to soften his language.\n\nMr. Wilson having lost his wife by consumption, and Georgiana being\nhis only child, he loved her too dearly to say more, even if he felt\ndisposed. A silence followed this exhortation from the young Christian,\nbut her remarks had done a noble work. The father's heart was touched,\nand the sceptic, for the first time, was viewing Christianity in its\ntrue light.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. A NIGHT IN THE PARSON'S KITCHEN\n\n\nBESIDES Agnes, whom Mr. Wilson had purchased from the slave-trader,\nJennings, he kept a number of house-servants. The chief one of these\nwas Sam, who must be regarded as second only to the parson himself. If\na dinner-party was in contemplation, or any company was to be invited,\nafter all the arrangements had been talked over by the minister and his\ndaughter, Sam was sure to be consulted on the subject by “Miss Georgy,”\n as Miss Wilson was called by all the servants. If furniture, crockery,\nor anything was to be purchased, Sam felt that he had been slighted if\nhis opinion was not asked. As to the marketing, he did it all. He sat\nat the head of the servants' table in the kitchen, and was master of\nthe ceremonies. A single look from him was enough to silence any\nconversation or noise among the servants in the kitchen or in any other\npart of the premises.\n\nThere is in the Southern States a great amount of prejudice in regard\nto color, even among the negroes themselves. The nearer the negro\nor mulatto approaches to the white, the more he seems to feel his\nsuperiority over those of a darker hue. This is no doubt the result of\nthe prejudice that exists on the part of the whites against both the\nmulattoes and the blacks.\n\nSam was originally from Kentucky, and through the instrumentality of one\nof his young masters, whom he had to take to school, he had learned\nto read so as to be well understood, and, owing to that fact, was\nconsidered a prodigy, not only among his own master's slaves, but also\namong those of the town who knew him. Sam had a great wish to follow in\nthe footsteps of his master and be a poet, and was therefore often heard\nsinging doggerels of his own composition.\n\nBut there was one drawback to Sam, and that was his color. He was one\nof the blackest of his race. This he evidently regarded as a great\nmisfortune; but he endeavored to make up for it in dress. Mr. Wilson\nkept his house-servants well dressed, and as for Sam, he was seldom seen\nexcept in a ruffled shirt. Indeed, the washerwoman feared him more than\nany one else in the house.\n\nAgnes had been inaugurated chief of the kitchen department, and had\na general supervision of the household affairs. Alfred, the coachman,\nPeter, and Hetty made up the remainder of the house-servants. Besides\nthese, Mr. Wilson owned eight slaves who were masons. These worked in\nthe city. Being mechanics, they were let out to greater advantage than\nto keep them on the farm.\n\nEvery Sunday evening, Mr. Wilson's servants, including the brick-layers,\nassembled in the kitchen, where the events of the week were fully\ndiscussed and commented upon. It was on a Sunday evening, in the month\nof June, that there was a party at Mr. Wilson's house, and, according to\ncustom in the Southern States, the ladies had their maid-servants with\nthem. Tea had been served in “the house,” and the servants, including\nthe strangers, had taken their seats at the table in the kitchen. Sam,\nbeing a “single gentleman,” was unusually attentive to the “ladies” on\nthis occasion. He seldom let a day pass without spending an hour or two\nin combing and brushing his “har.” He had an idea that fresh butter\nwas better for his hair than any other kind of grease, and therefore on\nchurning days half a pound of butter had always to be taken out before\nit was salted. When he wished to appear to great advantage, he would\ngrease his face to make it “shiny.” Therefore, on the evening of the\nparty, when all the servants were at the table, Sam cut a big figure.\nThere he sat, with his wool well combed and buttered, face nicely\ngreased, and his ruffles extending five or six inches from his bosom.\nThe parson in his drawing-room did not make a more imposing appearance\nthan did his servant on this occasion.\n\n“I jis bin had my fortune tole last Sunday night,” said Sam, while\nhelping one of the girls.\n\n“Indeed!” cried half a dozen voices.\n\n“Yes,” continued he; “Aunt Winny tole me I's to hab de prettiest yallah\ngal in de town, and dat I's to be free!”\n\nAll eyes were immediately turned toward Sally Johnson, who was seated\nnear Sam.\n\n“I 'specs I see somebody blush at dat remark,” said Alfred.\n\n“Pass dem pancakes an' 'lasses up dis way, Mr. Alf., and none ob your\n'sinuwashuns here,” rejoined Sam.\n\n“Dat reminds me,” said Agnes, “dat Dorcas Simpson is gwine to git\nmarried.”\n\n“Who to, I want to know?” inquired Peter.\n\n“To one of Mr. Darby's field-hands,” answered Agnes.\n\n“I should tink dat gal wouldn't frow herseff away in dat ar way,” said\nSally. “She's good lookin' 'nough to git a house-servant, and not hab to\nput up wid a field-nigger.\n\n“Yes,” said Sam, “dat's a werry unsensible remark ob yourn, Miss Sally.\nI admires your judgment werry much, I 'sures you. Dar's plenty ob\nsusceptible an' well-dressed house-serbants dat a gal ob her looks can\ngit widout takin' up wid dem common darkies.”\n\nThe evening's entertainment concluded by Sam's relating a little of his\nown experience while with his first master, in old Kentucky. This master\nwas a doctor, and had a large practice among his neighbors, doctoring\nboth masters and slaves. When Sam was about fifteen years old, his\nmaster set him to grinding up ointment and making pills. As the young\nstudent grew older and became more practised in his profession, his\nservices were of more importance to the doctor. The physician having\na good business, and a large number of his patients being slaves,--the\nmost of whom had to call on the doctor when ill,--he put Sam to\nbleeding, pulling teeth, and administering medicine to the slaves. Sam\nsoon acquired the name among the slaves of the “Black Doctor.” With this\nappellation he was delighted; and no regular physician could have put on\nmore airs than did the black doctor when his services were required. In\nbleeding, he must have more bandages, and would rub and smack the arm\nmore than the doctor would have thought of.\n\nSam was once seen taking out a tooth for one of his patients, and\nnothing appeared more amusing. He got the poor fellow down on his back,\nand then getting astride of his chest, he applied the turnkeys and\npulled away for dear life. Unfortunately, he had got hold of the wrong\ntooth, and the poor man screamed as loud as he could; but it was to no\npurpose, for Sam had him fast, and after a pretty severe tussle out came\nthe sound grinder. The young doctor now saw his mistake, but consoled\nhimself with the thought that as the wrong tooth was out of the way,\nthere was more room to get at the right one.\n\nBleeding and a dose of calomel were always considered indispensable\nby the “old boss,” and as a matter of course, Sam followed in his\nfootsteps.\n\nOn one occasion the old doctor was ill himself, so as to be unable to\nattend to his patients. A slave, with pass in hand, called to receive\nmedical advice, and the master told Sam to examine him and see what\nhe wanted. This delighted him beyond measure, for although he had been\nacting his part in the way of giving out medicine as the master ordered\nit, he had never been called upon by the latter to examine a patient,\nand this seemed to convince him after all that he was no sham doctor. As\nmight have been expected, he cut a rare figure in his first examination.\nPlacing himself directly opposite his patient, and folding his arms\nacross his breast, looking very knowingly, he began,--\n\n“What's de matter wid you?”\n\n“I is sick.”\n\n“Where is you sick?”\n\n“Here,” replied the man, putting his hand upon his stomach.\n\n“Put out your tongue,” continued the doctor.\n\nThe man ran out his tongue at full length.\n\n“Let me feel your pulse;” at the same time taking his patient's hand in\nhis, and placing his fingers upon his pulse, he said,--\n\n“Ah! your case is a bad one; ef I don't do something for you, and dat\npretty quick, you'll be a gone coon, and dat's sartin.” At this the\nman appeared frightened, and inquired what was the matter with him, in\nanswer to which Sam said,--\n\n“I done told dat your case is a bad one, and dat's enuff.”\n\nOn Sam's returning to his master's bedside, the latter said,--\n\n“Well, Sam, what do you think is the matter with him?”\n\n“His stomach is out ob order, sar,” he replied.\n\n“What do you think had better be done for him?”\n\n“I tink I'd better bleed him and gib him a dose ob calomel,” returned\nSam.\n\nSo, to the latter's gratification, the master let him have his own way.\n\nOn one occasion, when making pills and ointment, Sam made a great\nmistake. He got the preparations for both mixed together, so that he\ncould not legitimately make either. But fearing that if he threw the\nstuff away, his master would flog him, and being afraid to inform his\nsuperior of the mistake, he resolved to make the whole batch of pill and\nointment stuff into pills. He well knew that the powder over the pills\nwould hide the inside, and the fact that most persons shut their eyes\nwhen taking such medicine led the young doctor to feel that all would\nbe right in the end. Therefore Sam made his pills, boxed them up, put\non the labels, and placed them in a conspicuous position on one of the\nshelves.\n\nSam felt a degree of anxiety about his pills, however. It was a strange\nmixture, and he was not certain whether it would kill or cure; but he\nwas willing that it should be tried. At last the young doctor had his\nvanity gratified. Col. Tallen, one of Dr. Saxondale's patients, drove up\none morning, and Sam as usual ran out to the gate to hold the colonel's\nhorse.\n\n“Call your master,” said the colonel; “I will not get out.”\n\nThe doctor was soon beside the carriage, and inquired about the health\nof his patient. After a little consultation, the doctor returned to\nhis office, took down a box of Sam's new pills, and returned to the\ncarriage.\n\n“Take two of these every morning and night,” said the doctor, “and if\nyou don't feel relieved, double the dose.”\n\n“Good gracious,” exclaimed Sam in an undertone, when he heard his master\ntell the colonel how to take the pills.\n\nIt was several days before Sam could learn the result of his new\nmedicine. One afternoon, about a fortnight after the colonel's visit,\nSam saw his master's patient riding up to the gate on horseback. The\ndoctor happened to be in the yard, and met the colonel and said,--\n\n“How are you now?”\n\n“I am entirely recovered,” replied the patient. “Those pills of yours\nput me on my feet the next day.”\n\n“I knew they would,” rejoined the doctor.\n\nSam was near enough to hear the conversation, and was delighted beyond\ndescription. The negro immediately ran into the kitchen, amongst his\ncompanions, and commenced dancing.\n\n“What de matter wid you?” inquired the cook.\n\n“I is de greatest doctor in his country,” replied Sam. “Ef you ever get\nsick, call on me. No matter what ails you, I is de man dat can cure you\nin no time. If you do hab de backache, de rheumatics, de headache, de\ncoller morbus, fits, er any ting else, Sam is de gentleman dat can put\nyou on your feet wid his pills.”\n\nFor a long time after, Sam did little else than boast of his skill as a\ndoctor.\n\nWe have said that the “black doctor” was full of wit and good sense.\nIndeed, in that respect, he had scarcely an equal in the neighborhood.\nAlthough his master resided some little distance out of the city, Sam\nwas always the first man in all the negro balls and parties in town.\nWhen his master could give him a pass, he went, and when he did not give\nhim one, he would steal away after his master had retired, and run the\nrisk of being taken up by the night-watch. Of course, the master never\nknew anything of the absence of the servant at night without permission.\nAs the negroes at these parties tried to excel each other in the way of\ndress, Sam was often at a loss to make that appearance that his heart\ndesired, but his ready wit ever helped him in this. When his master had\nretired to bed at night, it was the duty of Sam to put out the lights,\nand take out with him his master's clothes and boots, and leave them in\nthe office until morning, and then black the boots, brush the clothes,\nand return them to his master's room.\n\nHaving resolved to attend a dress-ball one night, without his master's\npermission, and being perplexed for suitable garments, Sam determined to\ntake his master's. So, dressing himself in the doctor's clothes, even\nto his boots and hat, off the negro started for the city. Being well\nacquainted with the usual walk of the patrols he found no difficulty in\nkeeping out of their way. As might have been expected, Sam was the great\ngun with the ladies that night.\n\nThe next morning, Sam was back home long before his master's time for\nrising, and the clothes were put in their accustomed place. For a long\ntime Sam had no difficulty in attiring himself for parties; but the old\nproverb that “It is a long lane that has no turning,” was verified in\nthe negro's case. One stormy night, when the rain was descending in\ntorrents, the doctor heard a rap at his door. It was customary with him,\nwhen called up at night to visit a patient, to ring for Sam. But this\ntime, the servant was nowhere to be found. The doctor struck a light and\nlooked for clothes; they, too, were gone. It was twelve o'clock, and\nthe doctor's clothes, hat, boots, and even his watch, were nowhere to be\nfound. Here was a pretty dilemma for a doctor to be in. It was some time\nbefore the physician could fit himself out so as to make the visit. At\nlast, however, he started with one of the farm-horses, for Sam had taken\nthe doctor's best saddle-horse. The doctor felt sure that the negro had\nrobbed him, and was on his way to Canada; but in this he was mistaken.\nSam had gone to the city to attend a ball, and had decked himself out in\nhis master's best suit. The physician returned before morning, and again\nretired to bed but with little hope of sleep, for his thoughts were with\nhis servant and horse. At six o'clock, in walked Sam with his master's\nclothes, and the boots neatly blacked. The watch was placed on the\nshelf, and the hat in its place. Sam had not met any of the servants,\nand was therefore entirely ignorant of what had occurred during his\nabsence.\n\n“What have you been about, sir, and where was you last night when I was\ncalled?” asked the doctor.\n\n“I don't know, sir. I 'spose I was asleep,” replied Sam.\n\nBut the doctor was not to be so easily satisfied, after having been put\nto so much trouble in hunting up another suit without the aid of Sam.\nAfter breakfast, Sam was taken into the barn, tied up, and severely\nflogged with the cat, which brought from him the truth concerning\nhis absence the previous night. This forever put an end to his fine\nappearance at the negro parties. Had not the doctor been one of the most\nindulgent of masters, he would not have escaped with merely a severe\nwhipping.\n\nAs a matter of course, Sam had to relate to his companions that evening\nin Mr. Wilson's kitchen all his adventures as a physician while with his\nold master.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. THE MAN OF HONOR\n\n\nAUGUSTINE CARDINAY, the purchaser of Marion, was from the Green\nMountains of Vermont, and his feelings were opposed to the holding of\nslaves; but his young wife persuaded him into the idea that it was no\nworse to own a slave than to hire one and pay the money to another.\nHence it was that he had been induced to purchase Marion.\n\nAdolphus Morton, a young physician from the same State, and who had just\ncommenced the practice of his profession in New Orleans, was boarding\nwith Cardinay when Marion was brought home. The young physician had been\nin New Orleans but a very few weeks, and had seen but little of slavery.\nIn his own mountain-home, he had been taught that the slaves of the\nSouthern States were negroes, and if not from the coast of Africa, the\ndescendants of those who had been imported. He was unprepared to\nbehold with composure a beautiful white girl of sixteen in the degraded\nposition of a chattel slave.\n\nThe blood chilled in his young heart as he heard Cardinay tell how, by\nbantering with the trader, he had bought her two hundred dollars less\nthan he first asked. His very looks showed that she had the deepest\nsympathies of his heart.\n\nMarion had been brought up by her mother to look after the domestic\nconcerns of her cottage in Virginia, and well knew how to perform the\nduties imposed upon her. Mrs. Cardinay was much pleased with her new\nservant, and often mentioned her good qualities in the presence of Mr.\nMorton.\n\nAfter eight months acquaintance with Marion, Morton's sympathies ripened\ninto love, which was most cordially reciprocated by the friendless and\ninjured child of sorrow. There was but one course which the young man\ncould honorably pursue, and that was to purchase Marion and make her\nhis lawful wife; and this he did immediately, for he found Mr. and Mrs.\nCardinay willing to second his liberal intentions.\n\nThe young man, after purchasing Marion from Cardinay, and marrying her,\ntook lodgings in another part of the city. A private teacher was called\nin, and the young wife was taught some of those accomplishments so\nnecessary for one taking a high position in good society.\n\nDr. Morton soon obtained a large and influential practice in his\nprofession, and with it increased in wealth; but with all his wealth he\nnever owned a slave. Probably the fact that he had raised his wife from\nthat condition kept the hydra-headed system continually before him.\nTo the credit of Marion be it said, she used every means to obtain the\nfreedom of her mother, who had been sold to Parson Wilson, at Natchez.\nHer efforts, however, had come too late; for Agnes had died of a fever\nbefore the arrival of Dr. Morton's agent.\n\nMarion found in Adolphus Morton a kind and affectionate husband; and his\nwish to purchase her mother, although unsuccessful, had doubly endeared\nhim to her. Ere a year had elapsed from the time of their marriage, Mrs.\nMorton presented her husband with a lovely daughter, who seemed to knit\ntheir hearts still closer together. This child they named Jane; and\nbefore the expiration of the second year, they were blessed with another\ndaughter, whom they named Adrika.\n\nThese children grew up to the ages of ten and eleven, and were then\nsent to the North to finish their education, and receive that refinement\nwhich young ladies cannot obtain in the Slave States.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. THE QUADROON'S HOME\n\n\nA FEW miles out of Richmond is a pleasant place, with here and there a\nbeautiful cottage surrounded by trees so as scarcely to be seen. Among\nthese was one far retired from the public roads, and almost hidden\namong the trees. This was the spot that Henry Linwood had selected for\nIsabella, the eldest daughter of Agnes. The young man hired the house,\nfurnished it, and placed his mistress there, and for many months no one\nin his father's family knew where he spent his leisure hours.\n\nWhen Henry was not with her, Isabella employed herself in looking after\nher little garden and the flowers that grew in front of her cottage. The\npassion-flower, peony, dahlia, laburnum, and other plants, so abundant\nin warm climates, under the tasteful hand of Isabella, lavished their\nbeauty upon this retired spot, and miniature paradise.\n\nAlthough Isabella had been assured by Henry that she should be free and\nthat he would always consider her as his wife, she nevertheless felt\nthat she ought to be married and acknowledged by him. But this was an\nimpossibility under the State laws, even had the young man been disposed\nto do what was right in the matter. Related as he was, however, to one\nof the first families in Virginia, he would not have dared to marry a\nwoman of so low an origin, even had the laws been favorable.\n\nHere, in this secluded grove, unvisited by any other except her\nlover, Isabella lived for years. She had become the mother of a lovely\ndaughter, which its father named Clotelle. The complexion of the child\nwas still fairer than that of its mother. Indeed, she was not darker\nthan other white children, and as she grew older she more and more\nresembled her father.\n\nAs time passed away, Henry became negligent of Isabella and his child,\nso much so, that days and even weeks passed without their seeing him,\nor knowing where he was. Becoming more acquainted with the world, and\nmoving continually in the society of young women of his own station,\nthe young man felt that Isabella was a burden to him, and having as\nsome would say, “outgrown his love,” he longed to free himself of the\nresponsibility; yet every time he saw the child, he felt that he owed it\nhis fatherly care.\n\nHenry had now entered into political life, and been elected to a seat\nin the legislature of his native State; and in his intercourse with his\nfriends had become acquainted with Gertrude Miller, the daughter of a\nwealthy gentleman living near Richmond. Both Henry and Gertrude were\nvery good-looking, and a mutual attachment sprang up between them.\n\nInstead of finding fault with the unfrequent visits of Henry, Isabella\nalways met him with a smile, and tried to make both him and herself\nbelieve that business was the cause of his negligence. When he was with\nher, she devoted every moment of her time to him, and never failed to\nspeak of the growth and increasing intelligence of Clotelle.\n\nThe child had grown so large as to be able to follow its father on his\ndeparture out to the road. But the impression made on Henry's feelings\nby the devoted woman and her child was momentary. His heart had grown\nhard, and his acts were guided by no fixed principle. Henry and Gertrude\nhad been married nearly two years before Isabella knew anything of the\nevent, and it was merely by accident that she became acquainted with the\nfacts.\n\nOne beautiful afternoon, when Isabella and Clotelle were picking wild\nstrawberries some two miles from their home, and near the road-side,\nthey observed a one-horse chaise driving past. The mother turned her\nface from the carriage not wishing to be seen by strangers, little\ndreaming that the chaise contained Henry and his wife. The child,\nhowever, watched the chaise, and startled her mother by screaming out\nat the top of her voice, “Papa! papa!” and clapped her little hands for\njoy. The mother turned in haste to look at the strangers, and her eyes\nencountered those of Henry's pale and dejected countenance. Gertrude's\neyes were on the child. The swiftness with which Henry drove by could\nnot hide from his wife the striking resemblance of the child to himself.\nThe young wife had heard the child exclaim “Papa! papa!” and she\nimmediately saw by the quivering of his lips and the agitation depicted\nin his countenance, that all was not right.\n\n“Who is that woman? and why did that child call you papa?” she inquired,\nwith a trembling voice.\n\nHenry was silent; he knew not what to say, and without another word\npassing between them, they drove home.\n\nOn reaching her room, Gertrude buried her face in her handkerchief\nand wept. She loved Henry, and when she had heard from the lips of her\ncompanions how their husbands had proved false, she felt that he was an\nexception, and fervently thanked God that she had been so blessed.\n\nWhen Gertrude retired to her bed that night, the sad scene of the day\nfollowed her. The beauty of Isabella, with her flowing curls, and the\nlook of the child, so much resembling the man whom she so dearly loved,\ncould not be forgotten; and little Clotelle's exclamation of “Papa!\npapa!” rang in her ears during the whole night.\n\nThe return of Henry at twelve o'clock did not increase her happiness.\nFeeling his guilt, he had absented himself from the house since his\nreturn from the ride.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. TO-DAY A MISTRESS, TO-MORROW A SLAVE\n\n\nTHE night was dark, the rain descended in torrents from the black and\noverhanging clouds, and the thunder, accompanied with vivid flashes of\nlightning, resounded fearfully, as Henry Linwood stepped from his chaise\nand entered Isabella's cottage.\n\nMore than a fortnight had elapsed since the accidental meeting, and\nIsabella was in doubt as to who the lady was that Henry was with in the\ncarriage. Little, however, did she think that it was his wife. With a\nsmile, Isabella met the young man as he entered her little dwelling.\nClotelle had already gone to bed, but her father's voice aroused her\nfrom her sleep, and she was soon sitting on his knee.\n\nThe pale and agitated countenance of Henry betrayed his uneasiness, but\nIsabella's mild and laughing allusion to the incident of their meeting\nhim on the day of his pleasure-drive, and her saying, “I presume, dear\nHenry, that the lady was one of your relatives,” led him to believe that\nshe was still in ignorance of his marriage. She was, in fact, ignorant\nwho the lady was who accompanied the man she loved on that eventful day.\nHe, aware of this, now acted more like himself, and passed the thing off\nas a joke. At heart, however, Isabella felt uneasy, and this uneasiness\nwould at times show itself to the young man. At last, and with a great\neffort, she said,--\n\n“Now, hear Henry, if I am in the way of your future happiness, say so,\nand I will release you from any promises that you have made me. I know\nthere is no law by which I can hold you, and if there was, I would\nnot resort to it. You are as dear to me as ever, and my thoughts shall\nalways be devoted to you. It would be a great sacrifice for me to give\nyou up to another, but if it be your desire, as great as the sacrifice\nis, I will make it. Send me and your child into a Free State if we are\nin your way.”\n\nAgain and again Linwood assured her that no woman possessed his love\nbut her. Oh, what falsehood and deceit man can put on when dealing with\nwoman's love!\n\nThe unabated storm kept Henry from returning home until after the\nclock had struck two, and as he drew near his residence he saw his wife\nstanding at the window. Giving his horse in charge of the servant who\nwas waiting, he entered the house, and found his wife in tears. Although\nhe had never satisfied Gertrude as to who the quadroon woman and child\nwere, he had kept her comparatively easy by his close attention to\nher, and by telling her that she was mistaken in regard to the child's\ncalling him “papa.” His absence that night, however, without any\napparent cause, had again aroused the jealousy of Gertrude; but Henry\ntold her that he had been caught in the rain while out, which prevented\nhis sooner returning, and she, anxious to believe him, received the\nstory as satisfactory.\n\nSomewhat heated with brandy, and wearied with much loss of sleep,\nLinwood fell into a sound slumber as soon as he retired. Not so with\nGertrude. That faithfulness which has ever distinguished her sex, and\nthe anxiety with which she watched all his movements, kept the wife\nawake while the husband slept. His sleep, though apparently sound, was\nnevertheless uneasy. Again and again she heard him pronounce the name\nof Isabella, and more than once she heard him say, “I am not married;\nI will never marry while you live.” Then he would speak the name of\nClotelle and say, “My dear child, how I love you!”\n\nAfter a sleepless night, Gertrude arose from her couch, resolved that\nshe would reveal the whole matter to her mother. Mrs. Miller was a woman\nof little or no feeling, proud, peevish, and passionate, thus making\neverybody miserable that came near her; and when she disliked any\none, her hatred knew no bounds. This Gertrude knew; and had she not\nconsidered it her duty, she would have kept the secret locked in her own\nheart.\n\nDuring the day, Mrs. Linwood visited her mother and told her all that\nhad happened. The mother scolded the daughter for not having informed\nher sooner, and immediately determined to find out who the woman and\nchild were that Gertrude had met on the day of her ride. Three days were\nspent by Mrs. Miller in this endeavor, but without success.\n\nFour weeks had elapsed, and the storm of the old lady's temper had\nsomewhat subsided, when, one evening, as she was approaching her\ndaughter's residence, she saw Henry walking in the direction of where\nthe quadroon was supposed to reside. Being satisfied that the young\nman had not seen her, the old woman at once resolved to follow him.\nLinwood's boots squeaked so loudly that Mrs. Miller had no difficulty in\nfollowing him without being herself observed.\n\nAfter a walk of about two miles, the young man turned into a narrow and\nunfrequented road, and soon entered the cottage occupied by Isabella. It\nwas a fine starlight night, and the moon was just rising when they got\nto their journey's end. As usual, Isabella met Henry with a smile, and\nexpressed her fears regarding his health.\n\nHours passed, and still old Mrs. Miller remained near the house,\ndetermined to know who lived there. When she undertook to ferret out\nanything, she bent her whole energies to it. As Michael Angelo, who\nsubjected all things to his pursuit and the idea he had formed of it,\npainted the crucifixion by the side of a writhing slave and would have\nbroken up the true cross for pencils, so Mrs. Miller would have entered\nthe sepulchre, if she could have done it, in search of an object she\nwished to find.\n\nThe full moon had risen, and was pouring its beams upon surrounding\nobjects as Henry stepped from Isabella's door, and looking at his watch,\nsaid,--\n\n“I must go, dear; it is now half-past ten.”\n\nHad little Clotelle been awake, she too would have been at the door. As\nHenry walked to the gate, Isabella followed with her left hand locked in\nhis. Again he looked at his watch, and said,--\n\n“I must go.”\n\n“It is more than a year since you staid all night,” murmured Isabella,\nas he folded her convulsively in his arms, and pressed upon her\nbeautiful lips a parting kiss.\n\nHe was nearly out of sight when, with bitter sobs, the quadroon retraced\nher steps to the door of the cottage. Clotelle had in the mean time\nawoke, and now inquired of her mother how long her father had been gone.\nAt that instant, a knock was heard at the door, and supposing that it\nwas Henry returning for something he had forgotten, as he frequently\ndid, Isabella flew to let him in. To her amazement, however, a strange\nwoman stood in the door.\n\n“Who are you that comes here at this late hour?” demanded the\nhalf-frightened Isabella.\n\nWithout making any reply, Mrs. Miller pushed the quadroon aside, and\nentered the house.\n\n“What do you want here?” again demanded Isabella.\n\n“I am in search of you,” thundered the maddened Mrs. Miller; but\nthinking that her object would be better served by seeming to be kind,\nshe assumed a different tone of voice, and began talking in a pleasing\nmanner.\n\nIn this way, she succeeded in finding out that connection existing\nbetween Linwood and Isabella, and after getting all she could out of the\nunsuspecting woman, she informed her that the man she so fondly loved\nhad been married for more than two years. Seized with dizziness, the\npoor, heart-broken woman fainted and fell upon the floor. How long\nshe remained there she could not tell; but when she returned to\nconsciousness, the strange woman was gone, and her child was standing by\nher side. When she was so far recovered as to regain her feet, Isabella\nwent to the door, and even into the yard, to see if the old woman was no\nsomewhere about.\n\nAs she stood there, the full moon cast its bright rays over her whole\nperson, giving her an angelic appearance and imparting to her flowing\nhair a still more golden hue. Suddenly another change came over her\nfeatures, and her full red kips trembled as with suppressed emotion.\nThe muscles around her faultless mouth became convulsed, she gasped for\nbreath, and exclaiming, “Is it possible that man can be so false!” again\nfainted.\n\nClotelle stood and bathed her mother's temples with cold water until she\nonce more revived.\n\nAlthough the laws of Virginia forbid the education of slaves, Agnes had\nnevertheless employed an old free negro to teach her two daughters\nto read and write. After being separated from her mother and sister,\nIsabella turned her attention to the subject of Christianity, and\nreceived that consolation from the Bible which is never denied to the\nchildren of God. This was now her last hope, for her heart was torn with\ngrief and filled with all the bitterness of disappointment.\n\nThe night passed away, but without sleep to poor Isabella. At the dawn\nof day, she tried to make herself believe that the whole of the past\nnight was a dream, and determined to be satisfied with the explanation\nwhich Henry should give on his next visit.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. THE MOTHER-IN-LAW\n\n\nWHEN Harry returned home, he found his wife seated at the window,\nawaiting his approach. Secret grief was gnawing at her heart. Her sad,\npale cheeks and swollen eyes showed too well that agony, far deeper than\nher speech portrayed, filled her heart. A dull and death-like silence\nprevailed on his entrance. His pale face and brow, dishevelled hair, and\nthe feeling that he manifested on finding Gertrude still up, told Henry\nin plainer words than she could have used that his wife was aware that\nher love had never been held sacred by him. The window-blinds were still\nunclosed, and the full-orbed moon shed her soft refulgence over the\nunrivalled scene, and gave it a silvery lustre which sweetly harmonized\nwith the silence of the night. The clock's iron tongue, in a neighboring\nbelfry, proclaimed the hour of twelve, as the truant and unfaithful\nhusband seated himself by the side of his devoted and loving wife, and\ninquired if she was not well.\n\n“I am, dear Henry,” replied Gertrude; “but I feat _you_ are not. If well\nin body, I fear you are not at peace in mind.”\n\n“Why?” inquired he.\n\n“Because,” she replied, “you are so pale and have such a wild look in\nyour eyes.”\n\nAgain he protested his innocence, and vowed she was the only woman\nwho had any claim upon his heart. To behold one thus playing upon the\nfeelings of two lovely women is enough to make us feel that evil must at\nlast bring its own punishment.\n\nHenry and Gertrude had scarcely risen from the breakfast-table next\nmorning ere old Mrs. Miller made her appearance. She immediately took\nher daughter aside, and informed her of her previous night's experience,\ntelling her how she had followed Henry to Isabella's cottage, detailing\nthe interview with the quadroon, and her late return home alone. The old\nwoman urged her daughter to demand that the quadroon and her child be at\nonce sold to the negro speculators and taken out of the State, or that\nGertrude herself should separate from Henry.\n\n“Assert your rights, my dear. Let no one share a heart that justly\nbelongs to you,” said Mrs. Miller, with her eyes flashing fire. “Don't\nsleep this night, my child, until that wench has been removed from that\ncottage; and as for the child, hand that over to me,--I saw at once that\nit was Henry's.”\n\nDuring these remarks, the old lady was walking up and down the room\nlike a caged lioness. She had learned from Isabella that she had been\npurchased by Henry, and the innocence of the injured quadroon caused her\nto acknowledge that he was the father of her child. Few women could\nhave taken such a matter in hand and carried it through with more\ndetermination and success than old Mrs. Miller. Completely inured in all\nthe crimes and atrocities connected with the institution of slavery, she\nwas also aware that, to a greater or less extent, the slave women shared\nwith their mistress the affections of their master. This caused her to\nlook with a suspicious eye on every good-looking negro woman that she\nsaw.\n\nWhile the old woman was thus lecturing her daughter upon her rights and\nduties, Henry, unaware of what was transpiring, had left the house and\ngone to his office. As soon as the old woman found that he was gone, she\nsaid,--\n\n“I will venture anything that he is on his way to see that wench again.\nI'll lay my life on it.”\n\nThe entrance, however, of little Marcus, or Mark, as he was familiarly\ncalled, asking for Massa Linwood's blue bag, satisfied her that her\nson-in-law was at his office. Before the old lady returned home, it was\nagreed that Gertrude should come to her mother's to tea that evening,\nand Henry with her, and that Mrs. Miller should there charge the young\nhusband with inconstancy to her daughter, and demand the removal of\nIsabella.\n\nWith this understanding, the old woman retraced her steps to her own\ndwelling.\n\nHad Mrs. Miller been of a different character and not surrounded by\nslavery, she could scarcely have been unhappy in such a home as hers.\nJust at the edge of the city, and sheltered by large poplar-trees was\nthe old homestead in which she resided. There was a splendid orchard\nin the rear of the house, and the old weather-beaten sweep, with “the\nmoss-covered bucket” at its end, swung majestically over the deep well.\nThe garden was scarcely to be equalled. Its grounds were laid out in\nexcellent taste, and rare exotics in the greenhouse made it still more\nlovely.\n\nIt was a sweet autumn evening, when the air breathed through the\nfragrant sheaves of grain, and the setting sun, with his golden kisses,\nburnished the rich clusters of purple grapes, that Henry and Gertrude\nwere seen approaching the house on foot; it was nothing more than a\npleasant walk. Oh, how Gertrude's heart beat as she seated herself, on\ntheir arrival!\n\nThe beautiful parlor, surrounded on all sides with luxury and taste,\nwith the sun creeping through the damask curtains, added a charm to the\nscene. It was in this room that Gertrude had been introduced to Henry,\nand the pleasant hours that she had spent there with him rushed\nunbidden on her memory. It was here that, in former days, her beautiful\ncountenance had made her appearance as fascinating and as lovely as that\nof Cleopatra's. Her sweet, musical voice might have been heard in every\npart of the house, occasionally thrilling you with an unexpected touch.\nHow changed the scene! Her pale and wasted features could not be lighted\nup by any thoughts of the past, and she was sorrowful at heart.\n\nAs usual, the servants in the kitchen were in ecstasies at the\nannouncement that “Miss Gerty,” as they called their young mistress, was\nin the house, for they loved her sincerely. Gertrude had saved them from\nmany a flogging, by interceding for them, when her mother was in one of\nher uncontrollable passions. Dinah, the cook, always expected Miss\nGerty to visit the kitchen as soon as she came, and was not a little\ndispleased, on this occasion, at what she considered her young\nmistress's neglect. Uncle Tony, too, looked regularly for Miss Gerty\nto visit the green house, and congratulate him on his superiority as a\ngardener.\n\nWhen tea was over, Mrs. Miller dismissed the servants from the room,\nthen told her son-in-law what she had witnessed the previous night, and\ndemanded for her daughter that Isabella should be immediately sent out\nof the State, and to be sure that the thing would be done, she wanted\nhim to give her the power to make such disposition of the woman and\nchild as she should think best. Gertrude was Mrs. Miller's only child,\nand Henry felt little like displeasing a family upon whose friendship\nhe so much depended, and, no doubt, long wishing to free himself from\nIsabella, he at once yielded to the demands of his mother-in-law. Mr.\nMiller was a mere cipher about his premises. If any one came on business\nconnected with the farm, he would invariably say, “Wait till I see my\nwife,” and the wife's opinion was sure to be law in every case. Bankrupt\nin character, and debauched in body and mind, with seven mulatto\nchildren who claimed him as their father, he was badly prepared to find\nfault with his son-in-law. It was settled that Mrs. Miller should use\nher own discretion in removing Isabella from her little cottage, and her\nfuture disposition. With this understanding Henry and Gertrude returned\nhome. In the deep recesses of his heart the young man felt that he would\nlike to see his child and its mother once more; but fearing the wrath\nof his mother-in-law, he did not dare to gratify his inclination. He had\nnot the slightest idea of what would become of them; but he well knew\nthat the old woman would have no mercy on them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. A HARD-HEARTED WOMAN\n\n\nWITH no one but her dear little Clotelle, Isabella passed her weary\nhours without partaking of either food or drink, hoping that Henry would\nsoon return, and that the strange meeting with the old woman would be\ncleared up.\n\nWhile seated in her neat little bedroom with her fevered face buried in\nher handkerchief, the child ran in and told its mother that a carriage\nhad stopped in front of the house. With a palpitating heart she arose\nfrom her seat and went to the door, hoping that it was Henry; but,\nto her great consternation, the old lady who had paid her such an\nunceremonious visit on the evening that she had last seen Henry, stepped\nout of the carriage, accompanied by the slave-trader, Jennings.\n\nIsabella had seen the trader when he purchased her mother and sister,\nand immediately recognized him. What could these persons want there?\nthought she. Without any parleying or word of explanation, the two\nentered the house, leaving the carriage in charge of a servant.\n\nClotelle ran to her mother, and clung to her dress as if frightened by\nthe strangers.\n\n“She's a fine-looking wench,” said the speculator, as he seated himself,\nunasked, in the rocking-chair; “yet I don't think she is worth the money\nyou ask for her.”\n\n“What do you want here?” inquired Isabella, with a quivering voice.\n\n“None of your insolence to me,” bawled out the old woman, at the top\nof her voice; “if you do, I will give you what you deserve so much, my\nlady,--a good whipping.”\n\nIn an agony of grief, pale, trembling, and ready to sink to the floor,\nIsabella was only sustained by the hope that she would be able to save\nher child. At last, regaining her self-possession, she ordered them both\nto leave the house. Feeling herself insulted, the old woman seized\nthe tongs that stood by the fire-place, and raised them to strike the\nquadroon down; but the slave-trader immediately jumped between the\nwomen, exclaiming,--\n\n“I won't buy her, Mrs. Miller, if you injure her.”\n\nPoor little Clotelle screamed as she saw the strange woman raise the\ntongs at her mother. With the exception of old Aunt Nancy, a free\ncolored woman, whom Isabella sometimes employed to work for her, the\nchild had never before seen a strange face in her mother's dwelling.\nFearing that Isabella would offer some resistance, Mrs. Miller had\nordered the overseer of her own farm to follow her; and, just as\nJennings had stepped between the two women, Mull, the negro-driver,\nwalked into the room.\n\n“Seize that impudent hussy,” said Mrs. Miller to the overseer, “and tie\nher up this minute, that I may teach her a lesson she won't forget in a\nhurry.”\n\nAs she spoke, the old woman's eyes rolled, her lips quivered, and she\nlooked like a very fury.\n\n“I will have nothing to do with her, if you whip her, Mrs. Miller,” said\nthe slave-trader. “Niggers ain't worth half so much in the market with\ntheir backs newly scarred,” continued he, as the overseer commenced his\npreparations for executing Mrs. Miller's orders.\n\nClotelle here took her father's walking-stick, which was lying on the\nback of the sofa where he had left it, and, raising it, said,--\n\n“If you bad people touch my mother, I will strike you.”\n\nThey looked at the child with astonishment; and her extreme you,\nwonderful beauty, and uncommon courage, seemed for a moment to shake\ntheir purpose. The manner and language of this child were alike beyond\nher years, and under other circumstances would have gained for her the\napprobation of those present.\n\n“Oh, Henry, Henry!” exclaimed Isabella, wringing her hands.\n\n“You need not call on him, hussy; you will never see him again,” said\nMrs. Miller.\n\n“What! is he dead?” inquired the heart-stricken woman.\n\nIt was then that she forgot her own situation, thinking only of the\nman she loved. Never having been called to endure any kind of abusive\ntreatment, Isabella was not fitted to sustain herself against the\nbrutality of Mrs. Miller, much less the combined ferociousness of the\nold woman and the overseer too. Suffice it to say, that instead of\nwhipping Isabella, Mrs. Miller transferred her to the negro-speculator,\nwho took her immediately to his slave-pen. The unfeeling old woman would\nnot permit Isabella to take more than a single change of her clothing,\nremarking to Jennings,--\n\n“I sold you the wench, you know,--not her clothes.”\n\nThe injured, friendless, and unprotected Isabella fainted as she saw her\nchild struggling to release herself from the arms of old Mrs. Miller,\nand as the wretch boxed the poor child's ears.\n\nAfter leaving directions as to how Isabella's furniture and other\neffects should be disposed of, Mrs. Miller took Clotelle into her\ncarriage and drove home. There was not even color enough about the child\nto make it appear that a single drop of African blood flowed through its\nblue veins.\n\nConsiderable sensation was created in the kitchen among the servants\nwhen the carriage drove up, and Clotelle entered the house.\n\n“Jes' like Massa Henry fur all de worl',” said Dinah, as she caught a\nglimpse of the child through the window.\n\n“Wondah whose brat dat ar' dat missis bringin' home wid her?” said Jane,\nas she put the ice in the pitchers for dinner. “I warrant it's some poor\nwhite nigger somebody bin givin' her.”\n\nThe child was white. What should be done to make it look like other\nnegroes, was the question which Mrs. Miller asked herself. The\ncallous-hearted old woman bit her nether lip, as she viewed that child,\nstanding before her, with her long, dark ringlets clustering over her\nalabaster brow and neck.\n\n“Take this little nigger and cut her hair close to her head,” said the\nmistress to Jane, as the latter answered the bell.\n\nClotelle screamed, as she felt the scissors grating over her head, and\nsaw those curls that her mother thought so much of falling upon the\nfloor.\n\nA roar of laughter burst from the servants, as Jane led the child\nthrough the kitchen, with the hair cut so short that the naked scalp\ncould be plainly seen.\n\n“'Gins to look like nigger, now,” said Dinah, with her mouth upon a\ngrin.\n\nThe mistress smiled, as the shorn child reentered the room; but there\nwas something more needed. The child was white, and that was a great\nobjection. However, she hit upon a plan to remedy this which seemed\nfeasible. The day was excessively warm. Not a single cloud floated over\nthe blue vault of heaven; not a breath of wind seemed moving, and\nthe earth was parched by the broiling sun. Even the bees had stopped\nhumming, and the butterflies had hid themselves under the broad leaves\nof the burdock. Without a morsel of dinner, the poor child was put in\nthe garden, and set to weeding it, her arms, neck, and head completely\nbare. Unaccustomed to toil, Clotelle wept as she exerted herself in\npulling up the weeds. Old Dinah, the cook, was a unfeeling as her\nmistress, and she was pleased to see the child made to work in the hot\nsun.\n\n“Dat white nigger'll soon be brack enuff if missis keeps her workin' out\ndar,” she said, as she wiped the perspiration from her sooty brow.\n\nDinah was the mother of thirteen children, all of whom bad been\ntaken from her when young; and this, no doubt, did much to harden her\nfeelings, and make her hate all white persons.\n\nThe burning sun poured its rays on the face of the friendless child\nuntil she sank down in the corner of the garden, and was actually\nbroiled to sleep.\n\n“Dat little nigger ain't workin' a bit, missus,” said Dinah to Mrs.\nMiller, as the latter entered the kitchen.\n\n“She's lying in the sun seasoning; she will work the better by and by,”\n replied the mistress.\n\n“Dese white niggers always tink dey seff good as white folks,” said the\ncook.\n\n“Yes; but we will teach them better, won't we, Dinah?” rejoined Mrs.\nMiller.\n\n“Yes, missus,” replied Dinah; “I don't like dese merlatter niggers,\nno how. Dey always want to set dey seff up for sumfin' big.” With\nthis remark the old cook gave one of her coarse laughs, and continued:\n“Missis understands human nature, don't she? Ah! if she ain't a whole\nteam and de ole gray mare to boot, den Dinah don't know nuffin'.”\n\nOf course, the mistress was out of the kitchen before these last remarks\nwere made.\n\nIt was with the deepest humiliation that Henry learned from one of his\nown slaves the treatment which his child was receiving at the hands of\nhis relentless mother-in-law.\n\nThe scorching sun had the desired effect; for in less than a fortnight,\nClotelle could scarcely have been recognized as the same child. Often\nwas she seen to weep, and heard to call on her mother.\n\nMrs. Miller, when at church on Sabbath, usually, on warm days, took\nNancy, one of her servants, in her pew, and this girl had to fan her\nmistress during service. Unaccustomed to such a soft and pleasant seat,\nthe servant would very soon become sleepy and begin to nod. Sometimes\nshe would go fast asleep, which annoyed the mistress exceedingly. But\nMrs. Miller had nimble fingers, and on them sharp nails, and, with an\nenergetic pinch upon the bare arms of the poor girl, she would arouse\nthe daughter of Africa from her pleasant dreams. But there was no one\nof Mrs. Miller's servants who received so much punishment as old Uncle\nTony.\n\nFond of her greenhouse, and often in the garden, she was ever at the\nold gardener's heels. Uncle Tony was very religious, and, whenever his\nmistress flogged him, he invariably gave her a religious exhortation.\nAlthough unable to read, he, nevertheless, had on his tongue's end\nportions of Scripture which he could use at any moment. In one end of\nthe greenhouse was Uncle Tony's sleeping room, and those who happened\nin that vicinity, between nine and ten at night, could hear the old man\noffering up his thanksgiving to God for his protection during the day.\nUncle Tony, however, took great pride, when he thought that any of the\nwhites were within hearing, to dwell, in his prayer, on his own goodness\nand the unfitness of others to die. Often was he heard to say, “O Lord,\nthou knowest that the white folks are not Christians, but the black\npeople are God's own children.” But if Tony thought that his old\nmistress was within the sound of his voice, he launched out into deeper\nwater.\n\nIt was, therefore, on a sweet night, when the bright stars were looking\nout with a joyous sheen, that Mark and two of the other boys passed the\ngreenhouse, and heard Uncle Tony in his devotions.\n\n“Let's have a little fun,” said the mischievous Marcus to his young\ncompanions. “I will make Uncle Tony believe that I am old mistress, and\nhe'll give us an extra touch in his prayer.” Mark immediately commenced\ntalking in a strain of voice resembling, as well as he could, Mrs.\nMiller, and at once Tony was heard to say in a loud voice, “O Lord, thou\nknowest that the white people are not fit to die; but, as for old Tony,\nwhenever the angel of the Lord comes, he's ready.” At that moment, Mark\ntapped lightly on the door. “Who's dar?” thundered old Tony. Mark made\nno reply. The old man commenced and went through with the same remarks\naddressed to the Lord, when Mark again knocked at the door. “Who\ndat dar?” asked Uncle Tony, with a somewhat agitated countenance and\ntrembling voice. Still Mark would not reply. Again Tony took up the\nthread of his discourse, and said, “O Lord, thou knowest as well as I\ndo that dese white folks are not prepared to die, but here is old Tony,\nwhen de angel of de Lord comes, he's ready to go to heaven.” Mark once\nmore knocked on the door. “Who dat dar?” thundered Tony at the top of\nhis voice.\n\n“De angel of de Lord,” replied Mark, in a somewhat suppressed and\nsepulchral voice.\n\n“What de angel of de Lord want here?” inquired Tony, as if much\nfrightened.\n\n“He's come for poor old Tony, to take him out of the world,” replied\nMark, in the same strange voice.\n\n“Dat nigger ain't here; he die tree weeks ago,” responded Tony, in a\nstill more agitated and frightened tone. Mark and his companions made\nthe welkin ring with their shouts at the old man's answer. Uncle Tony\nhearing them, and finding that he had been imposed upon, opened his\ndoor, came out with stick in hand, and said, “Is dat you, Mr. Mark?\nyou imp, if I can get to you I'll larn you how to come here wid your\nnonsense.”\n\nMark and his companions left the garden, feeling satisfied that Uncle\nTony was not as ready to go with “de angel of de Lord” as he would have\nothers believe.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. THE PRISON\n\n\nWHILE poor little Clotelle was being kicked about by Mrs. Miller, on\naccount of her relationship to her son-in-law, Isabella was passing\nlonely hours in the county jail, the place to which Jennings had\nremoved her for safe-keeping, after purchasing her from Mrs. Miller.\nIncarcerated in one of the iron-barred rooms of that dismal place, those\ndark, glowing eyes, lofty brow, and graceful form wilted down like a\nplucked rose under a noonday sun, while deep in her heart's ambrosial\ncells was the most anguishing distress.\n\nVulgar curiosity is always in search of its victims, and Jennings'\nboast that he had such a ladylike and beautiful woman in his possession\nbrought numbers to the prison who begged of the jailer the privilege of\nseeing the slave-trader's prize. Many who saw her were melted to\ntears at the pitiful sight, and were struck with admiration at her\nintelligence; and, when she spoke of her child, they must have been\nconvinced that a mother's sorrow can be conceived by none but a mother's\nheart. The warbling of birds in the green bowers of bliss, which she\noccasionally heard, brought no tidings of gladness to her. Their joy\nfell cold upon her heart, and seemed like bitter mockery. They reminded\nher of her own cottage, where, with her beloved child, she had spent so\nmany happy days.\n\nThe speculator had kept close watch over his valuable piece of property,\nfor fear that it might damage itself. This, however, there was no danger\nof, for Isabella still hoped and believed that Henry would come to her\nrescue. She could not bring herself to believe that he would allow her\nto be sent away without at least seeing her, and the trader did all he\ncould to keep this idea alive in her.\n\nWhile Isabella, with a weary heart, was passing sleepless nights\nthinking only of her daughter and Henry, the latter was seeking relief\nin that insidious enemy of the human race, the intoxicating cup. His\nwife did all in her power to make his life a pleasant and a happy one,\nfor Gertrude was devotedly attached to him; but a weary heart gets no\ngladness out of sunshine. The secret remorse that rankled in his bosom\ncaused him to see all the world blood-shot. He had not visited his\nmother-in-law since the evening he had given her liberty to use her own\ndiscretion as to how Isabella and her child should be disposed of. He\nfeared even to go near the house, for he did not wish to see his child.\nGertrude felt this every time he declined accompanying her to her\nmother's. Possessed of a tender and confiding heart, entirely unlike her\nmother, she sympathized deeply with her husband. She well knew that all\nyoung men in the South, to a greater or less extent, became enamored of\nthe slave-women, and she fancied that his case was only one of the many,\nand if he had now forsaken all others for her she did not wish to be\npunished; but she dared not let her mother know that such were her\nfeelings. Again and again had she noticed the great resemblance between\nClotelle and Henry, and she wished the child in better hands than those\nof her cruel mother.\n\nAt last Gertrude determined to mention the matter to her husband.\nConsequently, the next morning, when they were seated on the back\npiazza, and the sun was pouring its splendid rays upon everything\naround, changing the red tints on the lofty hills in the distance into\nstreaks of purest gold, and nature seeming by her smiles to favor the\nobject, she said,--\n\n“What, dear Henry, do you intend to do with Clotelle?” A paleness that\noverspread his countenance, the tears that trickled down his cheeks,\nthe deep emotion that was visible in his face, and the trembling of his\nvoice, showed at once that she had touched a tender chord. Without a\nsingle word, he buried his face in his handkerchief, and burst into\ntears.\n\nThis made Gertrude still more unhappy, for she feared that he had\nmisunderstood her; and she immediately expressed her regret that she\nhad mentioned the subject. Becoming satisfied from this that his wife\nsympathized with him in his unhappy situation, Henry told her of the\nagony that filled his soul, and Gertrude agreed to intercede for him\nwith her mother for the removal of the child to a boarding-school in one\nof the Free States.\n\nIn the afternoon, when Henry returned from his office, his wife met him\nwith tearful eyes, and informed him that her mother was filled with rage\nat the mention of the removal of Clotelle from her premises.\n\nIn the mean time, the slave-trader, Jennings, had started for the South\nwith his gang of human cattle, of whom Isabella was one. Most quadroon\nwomen who are taken to the South are either sold to gentlemen for their\nown use or disposed of as house-servants or waiting-maids. Fortunately\nfor Isabella, she was sold for the latter purpose. Jennings found a\npurchaser for her in the person of Mr. James French.\n\nMrs. French was a severe mistress. All who lived with her, though\nwell-dressed, were scantily fed and over-worked. Isabella found her\nnew situation far different from her Virginia cottage-life. She had\nfrequently heard Vicksburg spoken of as a cruel place for slaves, and\nnow she was in a position to test the truthfulness of the assertion.\n\nA few weeks after her arrival, Mrs. French began to show to Isabella\nthat she was anything but a pleasant and agreeable mistress. What\nsocial virtues are possible in a society of which injustice is a primary\ncharacteristic,--in a society which is divided into two classes, masters\nand slaves? Every married woman at the South looks upon her husband as\nunfaithful, and regards every negro woman as a rival.\n\nIsabella had been with her new mistress but a short time when she was\nordered to cut off her long and beautiful hair. The negro is naturally\nfond of dress and outward display. He who has short woolly hair combs\nand oils it to death; he who has long hair would sooner have his teeth\ndrawn than to part with it. But, however painful it was to Isabella,\nshe was soon seen with her hair cut short, and the sleeves of her dress\naltered to fit tight to her arms. Even with her hair short and with\nher ill-looking dress, Isabella was still handsome. Her life had been a\nsecluded one, and though now twenty-eight years of age, her beauty\nhad only assumed a quieter tone. The other servants only laughed at\nIsabella's misfortune in losing her beautiful hair.\n\n“Miss 'Bell needn't strut so big; she got short nappy har's well's I,”\n said Nell, with a broad grin that showed her teeth.\n\n“She tink she white when she cum here, wid dat long har ob hers,”\n replied Mill.\n\n“Yes,” continued Nell, “missus make her take down her wool, so she no\nput it up to-day.”\n\nThe fairness of Isabella's complexion was regarded with envy by the\nservants as well as by the mistress herself. This is one of the hard\nfeatures of slavery. To-day a woman is mistress of her own cottage;\ntomorrow she is sold to one who aims to make her life as intolerable as\npossible. And let it be remembered that the house-servant has the best\nsituation a slave can occupy.\n\nBut the degradation and harsh treatment Isabella experienced in her new\nhome was nothing compared to the grief she underwent at being separated\nfrom her dear child. Taken from her with scarcely a moment's warning,\nshe knew not what had become of her.\n\nThis deep and heartfelt grief of Isabella was soon perceived by her\nowners, and fearing that her refusal to take proper food would cause\nher death, they resolved to sell her. Mr. French found no difficulty in\nsecuring a purchaser for the quadroon woman, for such are usually the\nmost marketable kind of property. Isabella was sold at private sale to a\nyoung man for a housekeeper; but even he had missed his aim.\n\nMr. Gordon, the new master, was a man of pleasure. He was the owner of\na large sugar plantation, which he had left under the charge of an\noverseer, and was now giving himself up to the pleasures of a city\nlife. At first Mr. Gordon sought to win Isabella's favor by flattery\nand presents, knowing that whatever he gave her he could take from her\nagain. The poor innocent creature dreaded every moment lest the scene\nshould change. At every interview with Gordon she stoutly maintained\nthat she had left a husband in Virginia, and could never think of taking\nanother. In this she considered that she was truthful, for she had\never regarded Henry as her husband. The gold watch and chain and other\nglittering presents which Gordon gave to her were all kept unused.\n\nIn the same house with Isabella was a man-servant who had from time to\ntime hired himself from his master. His name was William. He could feel\nfor Isabella, for he, like her, had been separated from near and\ndear relatives, and he often tried to console the poor woman. One day\nIsabella observed to him that her hair was growing out again.\n\n“Yes,” replied William; “you look a good deal like a man with your short\nhair.”\n\n“Oh,” rejoined she, “I have often been told that I would make a better\nlooking man than woman, and if I had the money I might avail myself of\nit to big farewell to this place.”\n\nIn a moment afterwards, Isabella feared that she had said too much, and\nlaughingly observed, “I am always talking some nonsense; you must not\nheed me.”\n\nWilliam was a tall, full-blooded African, whose countenance beamed with\nintelligence. Being a mechanic, he had by industry earned more money\nthan he had paid to his owner for his time, and this he had laid aside,\nwith the hope that he might some day get enough to purchase his freedom.\nHe had in his chest about a hundred and fifty dollars. His was a heart\nthat felt for others, and he had again and again wiped the tears from\nhis eyes while listening to Isabella's story.\n\n“If she can get free with a little money, why not give her what I have?”\n thought he, and then resolved to do it.\n\nAn hour after, he entered the quadroon's room, and, laying the money in\nher lap, said,--\n\n“There, Miss Isabella, you said just now that if you had the means you\nwould leave this place. There is money enough to take you to England,\nwhere you will be free. You are much fairer than many of the white women\nof the South, and can easily pass for a free white woman.”\n\nAt first Isabella thought it was a plan by which the negro wished to try\nher fidelity to her owner; but she was soon convinced, by his earnest\nmanner and the deep feeling he manifested, that he was entirely sincere.\n\n“I will take the money,” said she, “only on one condition, and that is\nthat I effect your escape, as well as my own.”\n\n“How can that be done?” he inquired, eagerly.\n\n“I will assume the disguise of a gentleman, and you that of a servant,\nand we will thus take passage in a steamer to Cincinnati, and from\nthence to Canada.”\n\nWith full confidence in Isabella's judgment, William consented at once\nto the proposition. The clothes were purchased; everything was arranged,\nand the next night, while Mr. Gordon was on one of his sprees, Isabella,\nunder the assumed name of Mr. Smith, with William in attendance as a\nservant, took passage for Cincinnati in the steamer Heroine.\n\nWith a pair of green glasses over her eyes, in addition to her other\ndisguise, Isabella made quite a gentlemanly appearance. To avoid\nconversation, however, she kept closely to her state-room, under the\nplea of illness.\n\nMeanwhile, William was playing his part well with the servants. He was\nloudly talking of his master's wealth, and nothing on the boat appeared\nso good as in his master's fine mansion.\n\n“I don't like dese steamboats, no how,” said he; “I hope when massa goes\non anoder journey, he take de carriage and de hosses.”\n\nAfter a nine-days' passage, the Heroine landed at Cincinnati, and Mr.\nSmith and his servant walked on shore.\n\n“William, you are now a free man, and can go on to Canada,” said\nIsabella; “I shall go to Virginia, in search of my daughter.”\n\nThis sudden announcement fell heavily upon William's ears, and with\ntears he besought her not to jeopardize her liberty in such a manner;\nbut Isabella had made up her mind to rescue her child if possible.\n\nTaking a boat for Wheeling, Isabella was soon on her way to her native\nState. Several months had elapsed since she left Richmond, and all her\nthoughts were centred on the fate of her dear Clotelle. It was with a\npalpitating heart that this injured woman entered the stage-coach at\nWheeling and set out for Richmond.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV. THE ARREST\n\n\nIT was late in the evening when the coach arrived at Richmond, and\nIsabella once more alighted in her native city. She had intended to seek\nlodgings somewhere in the outskirts of the town, but the lateness of the\nhour compelled her to stop at one of the principal hotels for the\nnight. She had scarcely entered the inn before she recognized among the\nnumerous black servants one to whom she was well known, and her only\nhope was that her disguise would keep her from being discovered. The\nimperturbable calm and entire forgetfulness of self which induced\nIsabella to visit a place from which she could scarcely hope to\nescape, to attempt the rescue of a beloved child, demonstrate that\nover-willingness of woman to carry out the promptings of the finer\nfeelings of the heart. True to woman's nature, she had risked her own\nliberty for another's. She remained in the hotel during the night, and\nthe next morning, under the plea of illness, took her breakfast alone.\n\nThat day the fugitive slave paid a visit to the suburbs of the town, and\nonce more beheld the cottage in which she had spent so many happy hours.\nIt was winter, and the clematis and passion-flower were not there; but\nthere were the same walks her feet had so often pressed, and the same\ntrees which had so often shaded her as she passed through the garden\nat the back of the house. Old remembrances rushed upon her memory and\ncaused her to shed tears freely. Isabella was now in her native town,\nand near her daughter; but how could she communicate with her? how could\nshe see her? To have made herself known would have been a suicidal act;\nbetrayal would have followed, and she arrested. Three days passed away,\nand still she remained in the hotel at which she had first put up, and\nyet she got no tidings of her child.\n\nUnfortunately for Isabella, a disturbance had just broken out among\nthe slave population in the State of Virginia, and all strangers were\ntreated with suspicion.\n\nThe insurrection to which we now refer was headed by a full-blooded\nnegro, who had been born and brought up a slave. He had heard the crack\nof the driver's whip, and seen the warm blood streaming from the negro's\nbody. He had witnessed the separation of parents from children, and was\nmade aware, by too many proofs, that the slave could expect no justice\nfrom the hands of the slave-owner. The name of this man was Nat Turner.\nHe was a preacher amongst the negroes, distinguished for his eloquence,\nrespected by the whites, loved and venerated by the negroes. On the\ndiscovery of the plan for the outbreak, Turner fled to the swamps,\nfollowed by those who had joined in the insurrection.\n\nHere the revolted negroes numbered some hundreds, and for a time bade\ndefiance to their oppressors. The Dismal Swamps cover many thousand\nacres of wild land, and a dense forest, with wild animals and insects\nsuch as are unknown in any other part of Virginia. Here runaway negroes\nusually seek a hiding-place, and some have been known to reside here for\nyears. The revolters were joined by one of these. He was a large, tall,\nfull-blooded negro, with a stern and savage countenance; the marks on\nhis face showed that he was from one of the barbarous tribes in Africa,\nand claimed that country as his native land. His only covering was\na girdle around his loins, made of skins of wild beasts which he had\nkilled. His only token of authority among those that he led was a pair\nof epaulettes, made of the tail of a fox, and tied to his shoulder by a\ncord. Brought from the coast of Africa, when only fifteen years of age,\nto the island of Cuba, he was smuggled from thence into Virginia. He had\nbeen two years in the swamps, and considered it his future home. He had\nmet a negro woman, who was also a runaway, and, after the fashion of his\nnative land, had gone through the process of oiling her, as the marriage\nceremony. They had built a cave on a rising mound in the swamp, and\nthis was their home. This man's name was Picquilo. His only weapon was\na sword made from a scythe which he had stolen from a neighboring\nplantation. His dress, his character, his manners, and his mode of\nfighting were all in keeping with the early training he had received in\nthe land of his birth. He moved about with the activity of a cat, and\nneither the thickness of the trees nor the depth of the water could stop\nhim. He was a bold, turbulent spirit; and, from motives of revenge, he\nimbrued his hands in the blood of all the whites he could meet.\nHunger, thirst, and loss of sleep, he seemed made to endure, as if by\npeculiarity of constitution. His air was fierce, his step oblique, his\nlook sanguinary.\n\nSuch was the character of one of the negroes in the Southampton\nInsurrection. All negroes were arrested who were found beyond their\nmaster's threshold, and all white strangers were looked upon with\nsuspicion.\n\nSuch was the position in which Isabella found affairs when she returned\nto Virginia in search of her child. Had not the slave-owners been\nwatchful of strangers, owing to the outbreak, the fugitive could not\nhave escaped the vigilance of the police; for advertisements announcing\nher escape, and offering a large reward for her arrest, had been\nreceived in the city previous to her arrival, and officers were\ntherefore on the lookout for her.\n\nIt was on the third day after her arrival in Richmond, as the quadroon\nwas seated in her room at the hotel, still in the disguise of a\ngentleman, that two of the city officers entered the apartment and\ninformed her that they were authorized to examine all strangers, to\nassure the authorities that they were not in league with the revolted\nnegroes.\n\nWith trembling heart the fugitive handed the key of her trunk to the\nofficers. To their surprise they found nothing but female apparel in the\ntrunk, which raised their curiosity, and caused a further investigation\nthat resulted in the arrest of Isabella as a fugitive slave. She was\nimmediately conveyed to prison, there to await the orders of her master.\n\nFor many days, uncheered by the voice of kindness, alone, hopeless,\ndesolate, she waited for the time to arrive when the chains should\nbe placed on her limbs, and she returned to her inhuman and unfeeling\nowner.\n\nThe arrest of the fugitive was announced in all the newspapers, but\ncreated little or no sensation. The inhabitants were too much engaged\nin putting down the revolt among the slaves; and, although all the odds\nwere against the insurgents, the whites found it no easy matter, with\nall their caution. Every day brought news of fresh outbreaks. Without\nscruple and without pity, the whites massacred all blacks found beyond\nthe limits of their owners' plantations. The negroes, in return, set\nfire to houses, and put to death those who attempted to escape from the\nflames. Thus carnage was added to carnage, and the blood of the whites\nflowed to avenge the blood of the blacks.\n\nThese were the ravages of slavery. No graves were dug for the negroes,\nbut their bodies became food for dogs and vultures; and their bones,\npartly calcined by the sun, remained scattered about, as if to mark\nthe mournful fury of servitude and lust of power. When the slaves were\nsubdued, except a few in the swamps, bloodhounds were employed to hunt\nout the remaining revolters.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI. DEATH IS FREEDOM\n\n\nON receiving intelligence of the arrest of Isabella, Mr. Gordon\nauthorized the sheriff to sell her to the highest bidder. She was,\ntherefore, sold; the purchaser being the noted negro-trader, Hope H.\nSlater, who at once placed her in prison. Here the fugitive saw none but\nslaves like herself, brought in and taken out to be placed in ships, and\nsent away to some part of the country to which she herself would soon be\ncompelled to go. She had seen or heard nothing of her daughter while in\nRichmond, and all hopes of seeing her had now fled.\n\nAt the dusk of the evening previous to the day when she was to be sent\noff, as the old prison was being closed for the night, Isabella suddenly\ndated past the keeper, and ran for her life. It was not a great distance\nfrom the prison to the long bridge which passes from the lower part of\nthe city across the Potomac to the extensive forests and woodlands of\nthe celebrated Arlington Heights, then occupied by that distinguished\nrelative and descendant of the immortal Washington, Mr. Geo. W. Custis.\nThither the poor fugitive directed her flight. So unexpected was her\nescape that she had gained several rods the start before the keeper had\nsecured the other prisoners, and rallied his assistants to aid in the\npursuit. It was at an hour, and in a part of the city where horses could\nnot easily be obtained for the chase; no bloodhounds were at hand to run\ndown the flying woman, and for once it seemed as if there was to be\na fair trial of speed and endurance between the slave and the\nslave-catchers.\n\nThe keeper and his force raised the hue-and-cry on her path as they\nfollowed close behind; but so rapid was the flight along the wide avenue\nthat the astonished citizens, as they poured forth from their dwellings\nto learn the cause of alarm, were only able to comprehend the nature of\nthe case in time to fall in with the motley throng in pursuit, or raise\nan anxious prayer to heaven as they refused to join in the chase (as\nmany a one did that night) that the panting fugitive might escape, and\nthe merciless soul-dealer for once be disappointed of his prey. And now,\nwith the speed of an arrow, having passed the avenue, with the distance\nbetween her and her pursuers constantly increasing, this poor, hunted\nfemale gained the “Long Bridge,” as it is called, where interruption\nseemed improbably. Already her heart began to beat high with the hope\nof success. She had only to pass three-quarters of a mile across the\nbridge, when she could bury herself in a vast forest, just as the time\nwhen the curtain of night would close around her, and protect her from\nthe pursuit of her enemies.\n\nBut God, by his providence, had otherwise determined. He had ordained\nthat an appalling tragedy should be enacted that night within plain\nsight of the President's house, and the Capitol of the Union, which\nwould be an evidence wherever it should be known of the unconquerable\nlove of liberty which the human heart may inherit, as well as a fresh\nadmonition to the slave-dealer of the cruelty and enormity of his\ncrimes.\n\nJust as the pursuers passed the high draw, soon after entering upon the\nbridge, they beheld three men slowly approaching from the Virginia side.\nThey immediately called to them to arrest the fugitive, proclaiming her\na runaway slave. True to their Virginia instincts, as she came near,\nthey formed a line across the narrow bridge to intercept her. Seeing the\nescape was impossible in that quarter, she stopped suddenly, and turned\nupon her pursuers.\n\nOn came the profane and ribald crew faster than ever, already exulting\nin her capture, and threatening punishment for her flight. For a moment\nshe looked wildly and anxiously around to see if there was no hope of\nescape. On either hand, far down below, rolled the deep, foaming waters\nof the Potomac, and before and behind were the rapidly approaching steps\nand noisy voices of her pursuers. Seeing how vain would be any further\neffort to escape, her resolution was instantly taken. She clasped her\nhands convulsively together, raised her tearful and imploring eyes\ntoward heaven, and begged for the mercy and compassion there which was\nunjustly denied her on earth; then, exclaiming, “Henry, Clotelle, I die\nfor thee!” with a single bound, vaulted over the railing of the bridge,\nand sank forever beneath the angry and foaming waters of the river!\n\nSuch was the life, and such the death, of a woman whose virtues and\ngoodness of heart would have done honor to one in a higher station of\nlife, and who, had she been born in any other land but that of slavery,\nwould have been respected and beloved. What would have been her\nfeelings if she could have known that the child for whose rescue she had\nsacrificed herself would one day be free, honored, and loved in another\nland?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII. CLOTELLE\n\n\nTHE curtain rises seven years after the death of Isabella. During that\ninterval, Henry, finding that nothing could induce his mother-in-law to\nrelinquish her hold on poor little Clotelle, and not liking to contend\nwith one on whom a future fortune depended, gradually lost all interest\nin the child, and left her to her fate.\n\nAlthough Mrs. Miller treated Clotelle with a degree of harshness\nscarcely equalled, when applied to one so tender in years, still the\nchild grew every day more beautiful, and her hair, though kept closely\ncut, seemed to have improved in its soft, silk-like appearance. Now\ntwelve years of age, and more than usually well-developed, her harsh old\nmistress began to view her with a jealous eye.\n\nHenry and Gertrude had just returned from Washington, where the husband\nhad been on his duties as a member of Congress, and where he had\nremained during the preceding three years without returning home. It\nwas on a beautiful evening, just at twilight, while seated at his parlor\nwindow, that Henry saw a young woman pass by and go into the kitchen.\nNot aware of ever having seen the person before, he made an errand into\nthe cook's department to see who the girl was. He, however, met her in\nthe hall, as she was about going out.\n\n“Whom did you wish to see?” he inquired.\n\n“Miss Gertrude,” was the reply.\n\n“What did you want to see her for?” he again asked.\n\n“My mistress told me to give her and Master Henry her compliments, and\nask them to come over and spend the evening.”\n\n“Who is your mistress?” he eagerly inquired.\n\n“Mrs. Miller, sir,” responded the girl.\n\n“And what's your name?” asked Henry, with a trembling voice.\n\n“Clotelle, sir,” was the reply.\n\nThe astonished father stood completely amazed, looking at the now\nwomanly form of her who, in his happier days, he had taken on his knee\nwith so much fondness and alacrity. It was then that he saw his own\nand Isabella's features combined in the beautiful face that he was then\nbeholding. It was then that he was carried back to the days when with\na woman's devotion, poor Isabella hung about his neck and told him how\nlonely were the hours in his absence. He could stand it no longer. Tears\nrushed to his eyes, and turning upon his heel, he went back to his own\nroom. It was then that Isabella was revenged; and she no doubt looked\nsmilingly down from her home in the spirit-land on the scene below.\n\nOn Gertrude's return from her shopping tour, she found Henry in a\nmelancholy mood, and soon learned its cause. As Gertrude had borne\nhim no children, it was but natural, that he should now feel his\nlove centering in Clotelle, and he now intimated to his wife\nhis determination to remove his daughter from the hands of his\nmother-in-law.\n\nWhen this news reached Mrs. Miller, through her daughter, she became\nfurious with rage, and calling Clotelle into her room, stripped her\nshoulders bare and flogged her in the presence of Gertrude.\n\nIt was nearly a week after the poor girl had been so severely whipped\nand for no cause whatever, that her father learned on the circumstance\nthrough one of the servants. With a degree of boldness unusual for him,\nhe immediately went to his mother-in-law and demanded his child. But\nit was too late,--she was gone. To what place she had been sent no one\ncould tell, and Mrs. Miller refused to give any information whatever\nrelative to the girl.\n\nIt was then that Linwood felt deepest the evil of the institution under\nwhich he was living; for he knew that his daughter would be exposed to\nall the vices prevalent in that part of the country where marriage is\nnot recognized in connection with that class.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII. A SLAVE-HUNTING PARSON\n\n\nIT was a delightful evening after a cloudless day, with the setting sun\nreflecting his golden rays on the surrounding hills which were covered\nwith a beautiful greensward, and the luxuriant verdure that forms the\nconstant garb of the tropics, that the steamer Columbia ran into the\ndock at Natchez, and began unloading the cargo, taking in passengers\nand making ready to proceed on her voyage to New Orleans. The plank\nconnecting the boat with the shore had scarcely been secured in its\nplace, when a good-looking man about fifty years of age, with a white\nneck-tie, and a pair of gold-rimmed glasses on, was seen hurrying on\nboard the vessel. Just at that moment could be seen a stout man with his\nface fitted with the small-pox, making his way up to the above-mentioned\ngentleman.\n\n“How do you do, my dear sir? this is Mr. Wilson, I believe,” said\nthe short man, at the same time taking from his mouth a large chew of\ntobacco, and throwing it down on the ship's deck.\n\n“You have the advantage of me, sir,” replied the tall man.\n\n“Why, don't you know me? My name is Jennings; I sold you a splendid\nnegro woman some years ago.”\n\n“Yes, yes,” answered the Natchez man. “I remember you now, for the woman\ndied in a few months, and I never got the worth of my money out of her.”\n\n“I could not help that,” returned the slave-trader; “she was as sound as\na roach when I sold her to you.”\n\n“Oh, yes,” replied the parson, “I know she was; but now I want a young\ngirl, fit for house use,--one that will do to wait on a lady.”\n\n“I am your man,” said Jennings, “just follow me,” continued he, “and\nI will show you the fairest little critter you ever saw.” And the two\npassed to the stern of the boat to where the trader had between fifty\nand sixty slaves, the greater portion being women.\n\n“There,” said Jennings, as a beautiful young woman shrunk back with\nmodesty. “There, sir, is the very gal that was made for you. If she had\nbeen made to your order, she could not have suited you better.”\n\n“Indeed, sir, is not that young woman white?” inquired the parson.\n\n“Oh, no, sir; she is no whiter than you see!”\n\n“But is she a slave?” asked the preacher.\n\n“Yes,” said the trader, “I bought her in Richmond, and she comes from an\nexcellent family. She was raised by Squire Miller, and her mistress was\none of the most pious ladies in that city, I may say; she was the salt\nof the earth, as the ministers say.”\n\n“But she resembles in some respect Agnes, the woman I bought from you,”\n said Mr. Wilson. As he said the name of Agnes, the young woman started\nas if she had been struck. Her pulse seemed to quicken, but her face\nalternately flushed and turned pale, and tears trembled upon her\neyelids. It was a name she had heard her mother mention, and it brought\nto her memory those days,--those happy days, when she was so loved and\ncaressed. This young woman was Clotelle, the granddaughter of Agnes.\nThe preacher, on learning the fact, purchased her, and took her home,\nfeeling that his daughter Georgiana would prize her very highly.\nClotelle found in Georgiana more a sister than a mistress, who, unknown\nto her father, taught the slave-girl how to read, and did much toward\nimproving and refining Clotelle's manners, for her own sake. Like\nher mother fond of flowers, the “Virginia Maid,” as she was sometimes\ncalled, spent many of her leisure hours in the garden. Beside the\nflowers which sprang up from the fertility of soil unplanted and\nunattended, there was the heliotrope, sweet-pea, and cup-rose,\ntransplanted from the island of Cuba. In her new home Clotelle found\nherself saluted on all sides by the fragrance of the magnolia. When she\nwent with her young mistress to the Poplar Farm, as she sometimes did,\nnature's wild luxuriance greeted her, wherever she cast her eyes.\n\nThe rustling citron, lime, and orange, shady mango with its fruits of\ngold, and the palmetto's umbrageous beauty, all welcomed the child\nof sorrow. When at the farm, Huckelby, the overseer, kept his eye on\nClotelle if within sight of her, for he knew she was a slave, and no\ndoubt hoped that she might some day fall into his hands. But she shrank\nfrom his looks as she would have done from the charm of the rattlesnake.\nThe negro-driver always tried to insinuate himself into the good opinion\nof Georgiana and the company that she brought. Knowing that Miss Wilson\nat heart hated slavery, he was ever trying to show that the slaves under\nhis charge were happy and contented. One day, when Georgiana and some of\nher Connecticut friends were there, the overseer called all the slaves\nup to the “great house,” and set some of the young ones to dancing.\nAfter awhile whiskey was brought in and a dram given to each slave, in\nreturn for which they were expected to give a toast, or sing a short\npiece of his own composition; when it came to Jack's turn he said,--\n\n“The big bee flies high, the little bee makes the honey: the black folks\nmake the cotton, and the white folks gets the money.”\n\nOf course, the overseer was not at all elated with the sentiment\ncontained in Jack's toast. Mr. Wilson had lately purchased a young man\nto assist about the house and to act as coachman. This slave, whose\nname was Jerome, was of pure African origin, was perfectly black, very\nfine-looking, tall, slim, and erect as any one could possibly be. His\nfeatures were not bad, lips thin, nose prominent, hands and feet small.\nHis brilliant black eyes lighted up his whole countenance. His hair,\nwhich was nearly straight, hung in curls upon his lofty brow. George\nCombe or Fowler would have selected his head for a model. He was brave\nand daring, strong in person, fiery in spirit, yet kind and true in his\naffections, earnest in his doctrines. Clotelle had been at the parson's\nbut a few weeks when it was observed that a mutual feeling had grown\nup between her and Jerome. As time rolled on, they became more and more\nattached to each other. After satisfying herself that these two really\nloved, Georgiana advised their marriage. But Jerome contemplated his\nescape at some future day, and therefore feared that if married it might\nmilitate against it. He hoped, also, to be able to get Clotelle away\ntoo, and it was this hope that kept him from trying to escape by\nhimself. Dante did not more love his Beatrice, Swift his Stella, Waller\nhis Saccharissa, Goldsmith his Jessamy bride, or Burns his Mary, than\ndid Jerome his Clotelle. Unknown to her father, Miss Wilson could\npermit these two slaves to enjoy more privileges than any of the other\nservants. The young mistress taught Clotelle, and the latter imparted\nher instructions to her lover, until both could read so as to be well\nunderstood. Jerome felt his superiority, and always declared that no\nmaster should ever flog him. Aware of his high spirit and determination,\nClotelle was in constant fear lest some difficulty might arise between\nher lover and his master.\n\nOne day Mr. Wilson, being somewhat out of temper and irritated at what\nhe was pleased to call Jerome's insolence, ordered him to follow him to\nthe barn to be flogged. The young slave obeyed his master, but those who\nsaw him at the moment felt that he would not submit to be whipped.\n\n“No, sir,” replied Jerome, as his master told him to take off his coat:\n“I will serve you, Master Wilson, I will labor for you day and night, if\nyou demand it, but I will not be whipped.”\n\nThis was too much for a white man to stand from a negro, and the\npreacher seized his slave by the throat, intending to choke him. But\nfor once he found his match. Jerome knocked him down, and then escaped\nthrough the back-yard to the street, and from thence to the woods.\n\nRecovering somewhat from the effect of his fall, the parson regained his\nfeet and started in pursuit of the fugitive. Finding, however, that the\nslave was beyond his reach, he at once resolved to put the dogs on his\ntrack. Tabor, the negro-catcher, was sent for, and in less than an hour,\neight or ten men, including the parson, were in the woods with hounds,\ntrying the trails. These dogs will attack a negro at their master's\nbidding; and cling to him as the bull-dog will cling to a beast. Many\nare the speculations as to whether the negro will be secured alive or\ndead, when these dogs once get on his track. Whenever there is to be a\nnegro hunt, there is no lack of participants. Many go to enjoy the fun\nwhich it is said they derive from these scenes.\n\nThe company had been in the woods but a short time ere they go on the\ntrack of two fugitives, once of whom was Jerome. The slaves immediately\nbent their steps toward the swamp, with the hope that the dogs, when put\nupon their scent would be unable to follow them through the water.\n\nThe slaves then took a straight course for the Baton Rouge and Bayou\nSara road, about four miles distant. Nearer and nearer the whimpering\npack pressed; their delusion begins to dispel. All at once the truth\nflashes upon the minds of the fugitives like a glare of light,--'tis\nTabor with his dogs!\n\nThe scent becomes warmer and warmer, and what was at first an irregular\ncry now deepens into one ceaseless roar, as the relentless pack presses\non after its human prey.\n\nThey at last reach the river, and in the negroes plunge, followed by the\ncatch-dog. Jerome is caught and is once more in the hands of his master,\nwhile the other poor fellow finds a watery grave. They return, and the\npreacher sends his slave to jail.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX. THE TRUE HEROINE\n\n\nIN vain did Georgiana try to console Clotelle, when the latter heard,\nthrough one of the other slaves, that Mr. Wilson had started with the\ndogs in pursuit of Jerome. The poor girl well knew that he would be\ncaught, and that severe punishment, if not death, would be the result of\nhis capture. It was therefore with a heart filled with the deepest grief\nthat the slave-girl heard the footsteps of her master on his return from\nthe chase. The dogged and stern manner of the preacher forbade even his\ndaughter inquiring as to the success of his pursuit. Georgiana secretly\nhoped that the fugitive had not bee caught; she wished it for the\nsake of the slave, and more especially for her maid-servant, whom she\nregarded more as a companion than a menial. But the news of the capture\nof Jerome soon spread through the parson's household, and found its way\nto the ears of the weeping and heart-stricken Clotelle.\n\nThe reverend gentleman had not been home more than an hour ere some of\nhis parishioners called to know if they should not take the negro from\nthe prison and execute _Lynch law_ upon him.\n\n“No negro should be permitted to live after striking a white man; let us\ntake him and hang him at once,” remarked an elderly-looking man, whose\ngray hairs thinly covered the crown of his head.\n\n“I think the deacon is right,” said another of the company; “if our\nslaves are allowed to set the will of their masters at defiance, there\nwill be no getting along with them,--an insurrection will be the next\nthing we hear of.”\n\n“No, no,” said the preacher; “I am willing to let the law take its\ncourse, as it provides for the punishment of a slave with death if he\nstrikes his master. We had better let the court decide the question.\nMoreover, as a Christian and God-fearing people, we ought to submit to\nthe dictates of justice. Should we take this man's life by force, an\nAllwise Providence would hold us responsible for the act.”\n\nThe company then quietly withdrew, showing that the preacher had some\ninfluence with his people.\n\n“This,” said Mr. Wilson, when left alone with his daughter,--“this, my\ndear Georgiana, is the result of your kindness to the negroes. You have\nspoiled every one about the house. I can't whip one of them, without\nbeing in danger of having my life taken.”\n\n“I am sure, papa,” replied the young lady,--“I am sure I never did\nany thing intentionally to induce any of the servants to disobey your\norders.”\n\n“No, my dear,” said Mr. Wilson, “but you are too kind to them. Now,\nthere is Clotelle,--that girl is completely spoiled. She walks about the\nhouse with as dignified an air as if she was mistress of the premises.\nBy and by you will be sorry for this foolishness of yours.”\n\n“But,” answered Georgiana, “Clotelle has a superior mind, and God\nintended her to hold a higher position in life than that of a servant.”\n\n“Yes, my dear, and it was your letting her know that she was intended\nfor a better station in society that is spoiling her. Always keep a\nnegro in ignorance of what you conceive to be his abilities,” returned\nthe parson.\n\nIt was late on the Saturday afternoon, following the capture of Jerome\nthat, while Mr. Wilson was seated in his study preparing his sermon for\nthe next day, Georgiana entered the room and asked in an excited tone if\nit were true that Jerome was to hanged on the following Thursday.\n\nThe minister informed her that such was the decision of the court.\n\n“Then,” said she, “Clotelle will die of grief.”\n\n“What business has she to die of grief?” returned the father, his eyes\nat the moment flashing fire.\n\n“She has neither eaten nor slept since he was captured,” replied\nGeorgiana; “and I am certain that she will not live through this.”\n\n“I cannot be disturbed now,” said the parson; “I must get my sermon\nready for to-morrow. I expect to have some strangers to preach to, and\nmust, therefore, prepare a sermon that will do me credit.”\n\nWhile the man of God spoke, he seemed to say to himself,--\n\n     “With devotion's visage, and pious actions,\n      We do sugar over the devil himself.”\n\nGeorgiana did all in her power to soothe the feelings of Clotelle,\nand to induce her to put her trust in God. Unknown to her father, she\nallowed the poor girl to go every evening to the jail to see Jerome,\nand during these visits, despite her own grief, Clotelle would try to\ncomfort her lover with the hope that justice would be meted out to him\nin the spirit-land.\n\nThus the time passed on, and the day was fast approaching when the slave\nwas to die. Having heard that some secret meeting had been held by the\nnegroes, previous to the attempt of Mr. Wilson to flog his slave,\nit occurred to a magistrate that Jerome might know something of the\nintended revolt. He accordingly visited the prison to see if he could\nlearn anything from him, but all to no purpose. Having given up all\nhopes of escape, Jerome had resolved to die like a brave man. When\nquestioned as to whether he knew anything of a conspiracy among the\nslaves against their masters, he replied,--\n\n“Do you suppose that I would tell you if I did?”\n\n“But if you know anything,” remarked the magistrate, “and will tell us,\nyou may possibly have your life spared.”\n\n“Life,” answered the doomed man, “is worth nought to a slave. What\nright has a slave to himself, his wife, or his children? We are kept in\nheathenish darkness, by laws especially enacted to make our instruction\na criminal offence; and our bones, sinews, blood, and nerves are exposed\nin the market for sale.\n\n“My liberty is of as much consequence to me as Mr. Wilson's is to him.\nI am as sensitive to feeling as he. If I mistake not, the day will come\nwhen the negro will learn that he can get his freedom by fighting for\nit; and should that time arrive, the whites will be sorry that they have\nhated us so shamefully. I am free to say that, could I live my life over\nagain, I would use all the energies which God has given me to get up an\ninsurrection.”\n\nEvery one present seemed startled and amazed at the intelligence with\nwhich this descendant of Africa spoke.\n\n“He's a very dangerous man,” remarked one.\n\n“Yes,” said another, “he got some book-learning somewhere, and that has\nspoiled him.”\n\nAn effort was then made to learn from Jerome where he had learned to\nread, but the black refused to give any information on the subject.\n\nThe sun was just going down behind the trees as Clotelle entered the\nprison to see Jerome for the last time. He was to die on the next day.\nHer face was bent upon her hands, and the gushing tears were forcing\ntheir way through her fingers. With beating heart and trembling hands,\nevincing the deepest emotion, she threw her arms around her lover's neck\nand embraced him. But, prompted by her heart's unchanging love, she had\nin her own mind a plan by which she hoped to effect the escape of him\nto whom she had pledged her heart and hand. While the overcharged clouds\nwhich had hung over the city during the day broke, and the rain fell\nin torrents, amid the most terrific thunder and lightning, Clotelle\nrevealed to Jerome her plan for his escape.\n\n“Dress yourself in my clothes,” said she, “and you can easily pass the\njailer.”\n\nThis Jerome at first declined doing. He did not wish to place a\nconfiding girl in a position where, in all probability, she would have\nto suffer; but being assured by the young girl that her life would not\nbe in danger, he resolved to make the attempt. Clotelle being very tall,\nit was not probably that the jailer would discover any difference in\nthem.\n\nAt this moment, she took from her pocket a bunch of keys and unfastened\nthe padlock, and freed him from the floor.\n\n“Come, girl, it is time for you to go,” said the jailer, as Jerome was\nholding the almost fainting girl by the hand.\n\nBeing already attired in Clotelle's clothes, the disguised man embraced\nthe weeping girl, put his handkerchief to his face, and passed out of\nthe jail, without the keeper's knowing that his prisoner was escaping in\na disguise and under cover of the night.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX. THE HERO OF MANY ADVENTURES\n\n\nJEROME had scarcely passed the prison-gates, ere he reproached himself\nfor having taken such a step. There seemed to him no hope of escape out\nof the State, and what was a few hours or days at most, of life to him,\nwhen, by obtaining it, another had been sacrificed. He was on the eve\nof returning, when he thought of the last words uttered by Clotelle.\n“Be brave and determined, and you will still be free.” The words sounded\nlike a charm in his ears and he went boldly forward.\n\nClotelle had provided a suit of men's clothes and had placed them where\nher lover could get them, if he should succeed in getting out.\n\nReturning to Mr. Wilson's barn, the fugitive changed his apparel, and\nagain retraced his steps into the street. To reach the Free States by\ntravelling by night and lying by during the day, from a State so far\nsouth as Mississippi, no one would think for a moment of attempting to\nescape. To remain in the city would be a suicidal step. The deep sound\nof the escape of steam from a boat, which was at that moment ascending\nthe river, broke upon the ears of the slave. “If that boat is going\nup the river,” said he, “why not I conceal myself on board, and try to\nescape?” He went at once to the steamboat landing, where the boat was\njust coming in. “Bound for Louisville,” said the captain, to one who\nwas making inquiries. As the passengers were rushing on board, Jerome\nfollowed them, and proceeding to where some of the hands were stowing\naway bales of goods, he took hold and aided them.\n\n“Jump down into the hold, there, and help the men,” said the mate to the\nfugitive, supposing that, like many persons, he was working his way\nup the river. Once in the hull among the boxes, the slave concealed\nhimself. Weary hours, and at last days, passed without either water or\nfood with the hidden slave. More than once did he resolve to let his\ncase be known; but the knowledge that he would be sent back to Natchez\nkept him from doing so. At last, with lips parched and fevered to\na crisp, the poor man crawled out into the freight-room, and began\nwandering about. The hatches were on, and the room dark. There happened\nto be on board a wedding party, and a box, containing some of the bridal\ncake, with several bottles of port wine, was near Jerome. He found the\nbox, opened it, and helped himself. In eight days, the boat tied up at\nthe wharf at the place of her destination. It was late at night; the\nboat's crew, with the single exception of the man on watch, were on\nshore. The hatches were off, and the fugitive quietly made his way on\ndeck and jumped on shore. The man saw the fugitive, but too late to\nseize him.\n\nStill in a Slave State, Jerome was at a loss to know how he should\nproceed. He had with him a few dollars, enough to pay his way to Canada,\nif he could find a conveyance. The fugitive procured such food as he\nwanted from one of the many eating-houses, and then, following the\ndirection of the North Star, he passed out of the city, and took the\nroad leading to Covington. Keeping near the Ohio River, Jerome soon\nfound an opportunity to cross over into the State of Indiana. But\nliberty was a mere name in the latter State, and the fugitive learned,\nfrom some colored persons that he met, that it was not safe to travel by\ndaylight. While making his way one night, with nothing to cheer him but\nthe prospect of freedom in the future, he was pounced upon by three men\nwho were lying in wait for another fugitive, an advertisement of whom\nthey had received through the mail. In vain did Jerome tell them that he\nwas not a slave. True, they had not caught the man they expected; but,\nif they could make this slave tell from what place he had escaped, they\nknew that a good price would be paid them for the negro's arrest.\n\nTortured by the slave-catchers, to make him reveal the name of his\nmaster and the place from whence he had escaped, Jerome gave them a\nfictitious name in Virginia, and said that his master would give a large\nreward, and manifested a willingness to return to his “old boss.” By\nthis misrepresentation, the fugitive hoped to have another chance of\ngetting away. Allured with the prospect of a large sum of the needful,\nthe slave-catchers started back with their victim. Stopping on the\nsecond night at an inn, on the banks of the Ohio River, the kidnappers,\nin lieu of a suitable place in which to confine their prize during the\nnight, chained him to the bed-post of their sleeping-chamber. The white\nmen were late in retiring to rest, after an evening spent in drinking.\nAt dead of night, when all was still, the slave arose from the floor,\nupon which he had been lying, looked around and saw that Morpheus had\npossession of his captors. For once, thought he, the brandy bottle has\ndone a noble work. With palpitating heart and trembling limbs, he viewed\nhis position. The door was fast, but the warm weather had compelled them\nto leave the window open. If he could but get his chains off, he might\nescape through the window to the piazza. The sleepers' clothes hung upon\nchairs by the bedside. The slave thought of the padlock-key, examined\nthe pockets, and found it. The chains were soon off, and the negro\nstealthily making his way to the window. He stopped, and said to\nhimself, “These men are villains; they are enemies to all who, like\nme, are trying to be free. Then why not I teach them a lesson?” He then\ndressed himself in the best suit, hung his own worn-out and tattered\ngarments on the same chair, and silently passed through the window to\nthe piazza, and let himself down by one of the pillars, and started once\nmore for the North.\n\nDaylight came upon the fugitive before he had selected a hiding-place\nfor the day, and he was walking at a rapid rate, in hopes of soon\nreaching some woodland or forest. The sun had just begun to show itself,\nwhen the fugitive was astounded at seeing behind him, in the distance,\ntwo men upon horseback. Taking a road to the right, the slave saw before\nhim a farmhouse, and so near was he to it that he observed two men in\nfront of it looking at him. It was too late to turn back. The kidnappers\nwere behind him--strange men before him. Those in the rear he knew to be\nenemies, while he had no idea of what principles were the farmers. The\nlatter also saw the white men coming, and called to the fugitive to come\nthat way. The broad-brimmed hats that the farmers wore told the slave\nthat they were Quakers.\n\nJerome had seen some of these people passing up and down the river, when\nemployed on a steamer between Natchez and New Orleans, and had\nheard that they disliked slavery. He, therefore, hastened toward the\ndrab-coated men, who, on his approach, opened the barn-door, and told\nhim to “run in.”\n\nWhen Jerome entered the barn, the two farmers closed the door, remaining\noutside themselves, to confront the slave-catchers, who now came up and\ndemanded admission, feeling that they had their prey secure.\n\n“The can't enter my premises,” said one of the Friends, in rather a\nmusical voice.\n\nThe negro-catchers urged their claim to the slave, and intimated that,\nunless they were allowed to secure him, they would force their way in.\nBy this time, several other Quakers had gathered around the barn-door.\nUnfortunately for the kidnappers, and most fortunately for the\nfugitive, the Friends had just been holding a quarterly meeting in the\nneighborhood, and a number of them had not yet returned to their homes.\nAfter some talk, the men in drab promised to admit the hunters, provided\nthey procured an officer and a search-warrant from a justice of the\npeace. One of the slave-catchers was left to see that the fugitive did\nnot get away, while the others went in pursuit of an officer. In the\nmean time, the owner of the barn sent for a hammer and nails, and began\nnailing up the barn-door.\n\nAfter an hour in search of the man of the law, they returned with an\nofficer and a warrant. The Quaker demanded to see the paper, and, after\nlooking at it for some time, called to his son to go into the house for\nhis glasses. It was a long time before Aunt Ruth found the leather case,\nand when she did, the glasses wanted wiping before they could be used.\nAfter comfortably adjusting them on his nose, he read the warrant over\nleisurely.\n\n“Come, Mr. Dugdale, we can't wait all day,” said the officer.\n\n“Well, will thee read it for me?” returned the Quaker.\n\nThe officer complied, and the man in drab said,--\n\n“Yes, thee may go in, now. I am inclined to throw no obstacles in the\nway of the execution of the law of the land.”\n\nOn approaching the door, the men found some forty or fifty nails in it,\nin the way of their progress.\n\n“Lend me your hammer and a chisel, if you please, Mr. Dugdale,” said the\nofficer.\n\n“Please read that paper over again, will thee?” asked the Quaker.\n\nThe officer once more read the warrant.\n\n“I see nothing there which says I must furnish thee with tools to open\nmy door. If thee wants a hammer, thee must go elsewhere for it; I tell\nthee plainly, thee can't have mine.”\n\nThe implements for opening the door are at length obtained, and, after\nanother half-hour, the slave-catchers are in the barn. Three hours is a\nlong time for a slave to be in the hands of Quakers. The hay is turned\nover, and the barn is visited in every part; but still the runaway is\nnot found. Uncle Joseph has a glow upon his countenance; Ephraim shakes\nhis head knowingly; little Elijah is a perfect know-nothing, and, if you\nlook toward the house, you will see Aunt Ruth's smiling face, ready to\nannounce that breakfast is ready.\n\n“The nigger is not in this barn,” said the officer.\n\n“I know he is not,” quietly answered the Quaker.\n\n“What were you nailing up your door for, then, as if you were afraid we\nwould enter?” inquired one of the kidnappers.\n\n“I can do what I please with my own door, can't I,” said the Quaker.\n\nThe secret was out; the fugitive had gone in at the front door and out\nat the back; and the reading of the warrant, nailing up of the door,\nand other preliminaries of the Quaker, was to give the fugitive time and\nopportunity to escape.\n\nIt was now late in the morning, and the slave-catchers were a long way\nfrom home, and the horses were jaded by the rapid manner in which they\nhad travelled. The Friends, in high glee, returned to the house for\nbreakfast; the man of the law, after taking his fee, went home, and the\nkidnappers turned back, muttering, “Better luck next time.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI. SELF-SACRIFICE\n\n\nNOW in her seventeenth year, Clotelle's personal appearance presented a\ngreat contrast to the time when she lived with old Mrs. Miller. Her tall\nand well-developed figure; her long, silky black hair, falling in\ncurls down her swan-like neck; her bright, black eyes lighting up her\nolive-tinted face, and a set of teeth that a Tuscarora might envy, she\nwas a picture of tropical-ripened beauty. At times, there was a heavenly\nsmile upon her countenance, which would have warmed the heart of an\nanchorite. Such was the personal appearance of the girl who was now in\nprison by her own act to save the life of another. Would she be hanged\nin his stead, or would she receive a different kind of punishment? These\nquestions Clotelle did not ask herself. Open, frank, free, and generous\nto a fault, she always thought of others, never of her own welfare.\n\nThe long stay of Clotelle caused some uneasiness to Miss Wilson; yet she\ndared not tell her father, for he had forbidden the slave-girl's going\nto the prison to see her lover. While the clock on the church near by\nwas striking eleven, Georgiana called Sam, and sent him to the prison in\nsearch of Clotelle.\n\n“The girl went away from here at eight o'clock,” was the jailer's answer\nto the servant's inquiries.\n\nThe return of Sam without having found the girl saddened the heart of\nthe young mistress. “Sure, then,” said she, “the poor, heartbroken thing\nhas made way with herself.”\n\nStill, she waited till morning before breaking the news of Clotelle's\nabsence to her father.\n\nThe jailer discovered, the next morning, to his utter astonishment, that\nhis prisoner was white instead of black, and his first impression was\nthat the change of complexion had taken place during the night, through\nfear of death. But this conjecture was soon dissipated; for the dark,\nglowing eyes, the sable curls upon the lofty brow, and the mild, sweet\nvoice that answered his questions, informed him that the prisoner before\nhim was another being.\n\nOn learning, in the morning, that Clotelle was in jail dressed in male\nattire, Miss Wilson immediately sent clothes to her to make a change in\nher attire. News of the heroic and daring act of the slave-girl spread\nthrough the city with electric speed.\n\n“I will sell every nigger on the place,” said the parson, at the\nbreakfast-table,--“I will sell them all, and get a new lot, and whip\nthem every day.”\n\nPoor Georgiana wept for the safety of Clotelle, while she felt glad that\nJerome had escaped. In vain did they try to extort from the girl the\nwhereabouts of the man whose escape she had effected. She was not aware\nthat he had fled on a steamer, and when questioned, she replied,--\n\n“I don't know; and if I did I would not tell you. I care not what you do\nwith me, if Jerome but escapes.”\n\nThe smile with which she uttered these words finely illustrated the\npoet's meaning, when he says,--\n\n     “A fearful gift upon they heart is laid,\n      Woman--the power to suffer and to love.”\n\nHer sweet simplicity seemed to dare them to lay their rough hands amid\nher trembling curls.\n\nThree days did the heroic young woman remain in prison, to be gazed at\nby an unfeeling crowd, drawn there out of curiosity. The intelligence\ncame to her at last that the court had decided to spare her life, on\ncondition that she should be whipped, sold, and sent out of the State\nwithin twenty-four hours.\n\nThis order of the court she would have cared but little for, had she not\nbeen sincerely attached to her young mistress.\n\n“Do try and sell her to some one who will use her well,” said Georgiana\nto her father, as he was about taking his hat to leave the house.\n\n“I shall not trouble myself to do any such thing,” replied the\nhard-hearted parson. “I leave the finding of a master for her with the\nslave-dealer.”\n\nBathed in tears, Miss Wilson paced her room in the absence of her\nfather. For many months Georgiana had been in a decline, and any little\ntrouble would lay her on a sick bed for days. She was, therefore, poorly\nable to bear the loss of this companion, whom she so dearly loved.\n\nMr. Wilson had informed his daughter that Clotelle was to be flogged;\nand when Felice came in and informed her mistress that the poor girl had\njust received fifty lashes on her bare person, the young lady fainted\nand fell on the floor. The servants placed their mistress on the sofa,\nand went in pursuit of their master. Little did the preacher think, on\nreturning to his daughter, that he should soon be bereft of her; yet\nsuch was to be his lot. A blood-vessel had been ruptured, and the three\nphysicians who were called in told the father that he must prepare to\nlose his child. That moral courage and calmness, which was her great\ncharacteristic, did not forsake Georgiana in her hour of death. She\nhad ever been kind to the slaves under her charge, and they loved and\nrespected her. At her request, the servants were all brought into her\nroom, and took a last farewell of their mistress. Seldom, if ever, was\nthere witnessed a more touching scene than this. There lay the young\nwoman, pale and feeble, with death stamped upon her countenance,\nsurrounded by the sons and daughters of Africa, some of whom had been\nseparated from every earthly tie, and the most of whose persons had been\ntorn and gashed by the negro-whip. Some were upon their knees at the\nbedside, others standing around, and all weeping.\n\nDeath is a leveler; and neither age, sex, wealth, nor condition, can\navert when he is permitted to strike. The most beautiful flowers\nmust soon fade and droop and die. So, also, with man; his days are as\nuncertain as the passing breeze. This hour he glows in the blush of\nhealth and vigor, but the next, he may be counted with the number no\nmore known on earth. Oh, what a silence pervaded the house when this\nyoung flower was gone! In the midst of the buoyancy of youth, this\ncherished one had dropped and died. Deep were the sounds of grief and\nmourning heard in that stately dwelling when the stricken friends, whose\noffice it had been to nurse and soothe the weary sufferer, beheld her\npale and motionless in the sleep of death.\n\nWho can imagine the feeling with which poor Clotelle received the\nintelligence of her kind friend's death? The deep gashes of the cruel\nwhip had prostrated the lovely form of the quadroon, and she lay upon\nher bed of straw in the dark cell. The speculator had brought her, but\nhad postponed her removal till she should recover. Her benefactress was\ndead, and--\n\n     “Hope withering fled, and mercy sighed farewell.”\n\n“Is Jerome safe?” she would ask herself continually. If her lover could\nhave but known of the sufferings of that sweet flower,--that polyanthus\nover which he had so often been in his dreams,--he would then have\nlearned that she was worthy of his love.\n\nIt was more than a fortnight before the slave-trader could take his\nprize to more comfortable quarters. Like Alcibiades, who defaced\nthe images of the gods and expected to be pardoned on the ground of\neccentricity, so men who abuse God's image hope to escape the vengeance\nof his wrath under the plea that the law sanctions their atrocious\ndeeds.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII. LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT AND WHAT FOLLOWED\n\n\nIT was a beautiful Sunday in September, with a cloudless sky, and the\nrays of the sun parching the already thirsty earth, that Clotelle stood\nat an upper window in Slater's slave-pen in New Orleans, gasping for\na breath of fresh air. The bells of thirty churches were calling the\npeople to the different places of worship. Crowds were seen wending\ntheir way to the houses of God; one followed by a negro boy carrying\nhis master's Bible; another followed by her maid-servant holding the\nmistress' fan; a third supporting an umbrella over his master's head\nto shield him from the burning sun. Baptists immersed, Presbyterians\nsprinkled, Methodists shouted, and Episcopalians read their prayers,\nwhile ministers of the various sects preached that Christ died for all.\nThe chiming of the bells seemed to mock the sighs and deep groans of the\nforty human beings then incarcerated in the slave-pen. These imprisoned\nchildren of God were many of them Methodists, some Baptists, and others\nclaiming to believe in the faith of the Presbyterians and Episcopalians.\n\nOh, with what anxiety did these creatures await the close of that\nSabbath, and the dawn of another day, that should deliver them from\nthose dismal and close cells. Slowly the day passed away, and once\nmore the evening breeze found its way through the barred windows of the\nprison that contained these injured sons and daughters of America.\n\nThe clock on the calaboose had just struck nine on Monday morning,\nwhen hundreds of persons were seen threading the gates and doors of the\nnegro-pen. It was the same gang that had the day previous been stepping\nto the tune and keeping time with the musical church bells. Their Bibles\nwere not with them, their prayer-books were left at home, and even their\nlong and solemn faces had been laid aside for the week. They had come\nto the man-market to make their purchases. Methodists were in search of\ntheir brethren. Baptists were looking for those that had been immersed,\nwhile Presbyterians were willing to buy fellow-Christians, whether\nsprinkled or not. The crowd was soon gazing at and feasting their eyes\nupon the lovely features of Clotelle.\n\n“She is handsomer,” muttered one to himself, “than the lady that sat in\nthe pew next to me yesterday.”\n\n“I would that my daughter was half so pretty,” thinks a second.\n\nGroups are seen talking in every part of the vast building, and the\ntopic on 'Change, is the “beautiful quadroon.” By and by, a tall young\nman with a foreign face, the curling mustache protruding from under a\nfinely-chiseled nose, and having the air of a gentleman, passes by. His\ndark hazel eye is fastened on the maid, and he stops for a moment; the\nstranger walks away, but soon returns--he looks, he sees the young woman\nwipe away the silent tear that steals down her alabaster cheek; he\nfeels ashamed that he should gaze so unmanly on the blushing face of the\nwoman. As he turns upon his heel he takes out his white handkerchief and\nwipes his eyes. It may be that he has lost a sister, a mother, or some\ndear one to whom he was betrothed. Again he comes, and the quadroon\nhides her face. She has heard that foreigners make bad masters, and she\nshuns his piercing gaze. Again he goes away and then returns. He takes a\nlast look and then walks hurriedly off.\n\nThe day wears away, but long before the time of closing the sale\nthe tall young man once more enters the slave-pen. He looks in every\ndirection for the beautiful slave, but she is not there--she has been\nsold! He goes to the trader and inquires, but he is too late, and he\ntherefore returns to his hotel.\n\nHaving entered a military school in Paris when quite young, and soon\nafter been sent with the French army to India, Antoine Devenant had\nnever dabbled in matters of love. He viewed all women from the same\nstand-point--respected them for their virtues, and often spoke of the\ngoodness of heart of the sex, but never dreamed of taking to himself a\nwife. The unequalled beauty of Clotelle had dazzled his eyes, and\nevery look that she gave was a dagger that went to his heart. He felt a\nshortness of breath, his heart palpitated, his head grew dizzy, and his\nlimbs trembled; but he knew not its cause. This was the first stage of\n“love at first sight.”\n\nHe who bows to the shrine of beauty when beckoned by this mysterious\nagent seldom regrets it. Devenant reproached himself for not having made\ninquiries concerning the girl before he left the market in the morning.\nHis stay in the city was to be short, and the yellow fever was raging,\nwhich caused him to feel like making a still earlier departure. The\ndisease appeared in a form unusually severe and repulsive. It seized\nits victims from amongst the most healthy of the citizens. The disorder\nbegan in the brain by oppressive pain accompanied or followed by fever.\nFiery veins streaked the eye, the face was inflamed and dyed of a dark\ndull red color; the ears from time to time rang painfully. Now mucous\nsecretions surcharged the tongue and took away the power of speech; now\nthe sick one spoke, but in speaking had foresight of death. When the\nviolence of the disease approached the heart, the gums were blackened.\nThe sleep broken, troubled by convulsions, or by frightful visions, was\nworse than the waking hours; and when the reason sank under a delirium\nwhich had its seat in the brain, repose utterly forsook the patient's\ncouch. The progress of the fever within was marked by yellowish spots,\nwhich spread over the surface of the body. If then, a happy crisis came\nnot, all hope was gone. Soon the breath infected the air with a fetid\nodor, the lips were glazed, despair painted itself in the eyes, and\nsobs, with long intervals of silence, formed the only language. From\neach side of the mouth, spread foam tinged with black and burnt blood.\nBlue streaks mingled with the yellow all over the frame. All remedies\nwere useless. This was the yellow fever. The disorder spread alarm and\nconfusion throughout the city. On an average more than four hundred died\ndaily. In the midst of disorder and confusion, death heaped victims\non victims. Friend followed friend in quick succession. The sick were\navoided from the fear of contagion, and for the same reason the dead\nwere left unburied. Nearly two thousand dead bodies lay uncovered in the\nburial-ground, with only here and there a little lime thrown over them,\nto prevent the air becoming infected. The negro, whose home is in a\nhot climate, was not proof against the disease. Many plantations had to\nsuspend their work for want of slaves to take the places of those who\nhad been taken off by the fever.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII. MEETING OF THE COUSINS\n\n\nTHE clock in the hall had scarcely finished striking three when Mr.\nTaylor entered his own dwelling, a fine residence in Camp Street, New\nOrleans, followed by the slave-girl whom he had just purchased at the\nnegro-pen. Clotelle looked around wildly as she passed through the hall\ninto the presence of her new mistress. Mrs. Taylor was much pleased with\nher servant's appearance, and congratulated her husband on his judicious\nchoice.\n\n“But,” said Mrs. Taylor, after Clotelle had gone into the kitchen, “how\nmuch she looks like Miss Jane Morton.”\n\n“Indeed,” replied the husband, “I thought, the moment I saw her that she\nlooked like the Mortons.”\n\n“I am sure I never saw two faces more alike in my life, than that girl's\nand Jane Morton's,” continued Mrs. Taylor.\n\nDr. Morton, the purchaser of Marion, the youngest daughter of Agnes, and\nsister to Isabella, had resided in Camp Street, near the Taylors, for\nmore than eight years, and the families were on very intimate terms,\nand visited each other frequently. Every one spoke of Clotelle's close\nresemblance to the Mortons, and especially to the eldest daughter.\nIndeed, two sisters could hardly have been more alike. The large, dark\neyes, black, silk-like hair, tall, graceful figure, and mould of the\nface, were the same.\n\nThe morning following Clotelle's arrival in her new home, Mrs. Taylor\nwas conversing in a low tone with her husband, and both with their eyes\nfollowing Clotelle as she passed through the room.\n\n“She is far above the station of a slave,” remarked the lady. “I saw\nher, last night, when removing some books, open on and stand over it a\nmoment as if she was reading; and she is as white as I am. I am almost\nsorry you bought her.”\n\nAt this juncture the front door-bell rang, and Clotelle hurried through\nthe room to answer it.\n\n“Miss Morton,” said the servant as she returned to the mistress' room.\n\n“Ask her to walk in,” responded the mistress.\n\n“Now, my dear,” said Mrs. Taylor to her husband, “just look and see if\nyou do not notice a marked resemblance between the countenances of Jane\nand Clotelle.”\n\nMiss Morton entered the room just as Mrs. Taylor ceased speaking.\n\n“Have you heard that the Jamisons are down with the fever?” inquired the\nyoung lady, after asking about the health of the Taylors.\n\n“No, I had not; I was in hopes it would not get into our street,”\n replied Mrs. Taylor.\n\n    All this while Mr. and Mrs. Taylor were keenly scrutinizing\ntheir visitor and Clotelle and even the two young women seemed to be\nconscious that they were in some way the objects of more than usual\nattention.\n\nMiss Morton had scarcely departed before Mrs. Taylor began questioning\nClotelle concerning her early childhood, and became more than ever\nsatisfied that the slave-girl was in some way connected with the\nMortons.\n\nEvery hour brought fresh news of the ravages of the fever, and the\nTaylors commenced preparing to leave town. As Mr. Taylor could not go\nat once, it was determined that his wife should leave without him,\naccompanied by her new maid-servant. Just as Mrs. Taylor and Clotelle\nwere stepping into the carriage, they were informed that Dr. Morton was\ndown with the epidemic.\n\nIt was a beautiful day, with a fine breeze for the time of year,\nthat Mrs. Taylor and her servant found themselves in the cabin of the\nsplendid new steamer “Walk-in-the-Water,” bound from New Orleans to\nMobile. Every berth in the boat was occupied by persons fleeing from the\nfearful contagion that was carrying off its hundreds daily.\n\nLate in the day, as Clotelle was standing at one of the windows of the\nladies' saloon, she was astonished to see near her, and with eyes fixed\nintently upon her, the tall young stranger whom she had observed in the\nslave-market a few days before. She turned hastily away, but the heated\ncabin and the want of fresh air soon drove her again to the window. The\nyoung gentleman again appeared, and coming to the end of the saloon,\nspoke to the slave-girl in broken English. This confirmed her in her\nprevious opinion that he was a foreigner, and she rejoiced that she had\nnot fallen into his hands.\n\n“I want to talk with you,” said the stranger.\n\n“What do you want with me?” she inquired. “I am your friend,” he\nanswered. “I saw you in the slave-market last week, and regretted that I\ndid not speak to you then. I returned in the evening, but you was gone.”\n\nClotelle looked indignantly at the stranger, and was about leaving the\nwindow again when the quivering of his lips and the trembling of his\nvoice struck her attention and caused her to remain.\n\n“I intended to buy you and make you free and happy, but I was too late,”\n continued he.\n\n“Why do you wish to make me free?” inquired the girl.\n\n“Because I once had an only and lovely sister, who died three years\nago in France, and you are so much like her that had I not known of her\ndeath I should certainly have taken you for her.”\n\n“However much I may resemble your sister, you are aware that I am not\nshe; why, then, take so much interest in one whom you have never seen\nbefore and may never see again?”\n\n“The love,” said he, “which I had for my sister is transferred to you.”\n\nClotelle had all along suspected that the man was a knave, and this\nprofession of love at once confirmed her in that belief. She therefore\nimmediately turned away and left him.\n\nHours elapsed. Twilight was just “letting down her curtain and pinning\nit with a star,” as the slave-girl seated herself on a sofa by the\nwindow, and began meditating upon her eventful history, meanwhile\nwatching the white waves as they seemed to sport with each other in the\nwake of the noble vessel, with the rising moon reflecting its silver\nrays upon the splendid scene, when the foreigner once more appeared\nnear the window. Although agitated for fear her mistress would see her\ntalking to a stranger, and be angry, Clotelle still thought she saw\nsomething in the countenance of the young man that told her he was\nsincere, and she did not wish to hurt his feelings.\n\n“Why persist in your wish to talk with me?” she said, as he again\nadvanced and spoke to her.\n\n“I wish to purchase you and make you happy,” returned he.\n\n“But I am not for sale now,” she replied. “My present mistress will not\nsell me, and if you wished to do so ever so much you could not.”\n\n“Then,” said he, “if I cannot buy you, when the steamer reaches Mobile,\nfly with me, and you shall be free.”\n\n“I cannot do it,” said Clotelle; and she was just leaving the stranger\nwhen he took from his pocket a piece of paper and thrust it into her\nhand.\n\nAfter returning to her room, she unfolded the paper, and found, to her\nutter astonishment that it contained a one hundred dollar note on the\nBank of the United States. The first impulse of the girl was to return\nthe paper and its contents immediately to the giver, but examining the\npaper more closely, she saw in faint pencil-marks, “Remember this is\nfrom one who loves you.” Another thought was to give it to her mistress,\nand she returned to the saloon for that purpose; but on finding Mrs.\nTaylor engaged in conversation with some ladies, she did not deem it\nproper to interrupt her.\n\nAgain, therefore, Clotelle seated herself by the window, and again the\nstranger presented himself. She immediately took the paper from her\npocket, and handed it to him; but he declined taking it, saying,--\n\n“No, keep it; it may be of some service to you when I am far away.”\n\n“Would that I could understand you,” said the slave.\n\n“Believe that I am sincere, and then you will understand me,” returned\nthe young man. “Would you rather be a slave than be free?” inquired he,\nwith tears that glistened in the rays of the moon.\n\n“No,” said she, “I want my freedom, but I must live a virtuous life.”\n\n“Then, if you would be free and happy, go with me. We shall be in Mobile\nin two hours, and when the passengers are going on shore, you take my\narm. Have your face covered with a veil, and you will not be observed.\nWe will take passage immediately for France; you can pass as my sister,\nand I pledge you my honor that I will marry you as soon as we arrive in\nFrance.”\n\nThis solemn promise, coupled with what had previously been said, gave\nClotelle confidence in the man, and she instantly determined to go with\nhim. “But then,” thought she, “what if I should be detected? I would be\nforever ruined, for I would be sold, and in all probability have to end\nmy days on a cotton, rice, or sugar plantation.” However, the thought of\nfreedom in the future outweighed this danger, and her resolve was taken.\n\nDressing herself in some of her best clothes, and placing her veiled\nbonnet where she could get it without the knowledge of her mistress,\nClotelle awaited with a heart filled with the deepest emotions and\nanxiety the moment when she was to take a step which seemed so rash, and\nwhich would either make or ruin her forever.\n\nThe ships which Mobile for Europe lie about thirty miles down the\nbay, and passengers are taken down from the city in small vessels. The\n“Walk-in-the-Water” had just made her lines fast, and the passengers\nwere hurrying on shore, when a tall gentleman with a lady at his side\ndescended the stage-plank, and stepped on the wharf. This was Antoine\nDevenant and Clotelle.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV. THE LAW AND ITS VICTIM\n\n\nTHE death of Dr. Morton, on the third day of his illness, came like\na shock upon his wife and daughters. The corpse had scarcely been\ncommitted to its mother earth before new and unforeseen difficulties\nappeared to them. By the laws of the Slave States, the children follow\nthe condition of their mother. If the mother is free, the children are\nfree; if a slave, the children are slaves. Being unacquainted with the\nSouthern code, and no one presuming that Marion had any negro blood in\nher veins, Dr. Morton had not given the subject a single thought. The\nwoman whom he loved and regarded as his wife was, after all, nothing\nmore than a slave by the laws of the State. What would have been his\nfeelings had he known that at his death his wife and children would\nbe considered as his property? Yet such was the case. Like most men of\nmeans at that time, Dr. Morton was deeply engaged in speculation, and\nthough generally considered wealthy, was very much involved in his\nbusiness affairs.\n\nAfter the disease with which Dr. Morton had so suddenly died had to some\nextent subsided, Mr. James Morton, a brother of the deceased, went\nto New Orleans to settle up the estate. On his arrival there, he was\npleased with and felt proud of his nieces, and invited them to return\nwith him to Vermont, little dreaming that his brother had married a\nslave, and that his widow and daughters would be claimed as such. The\ngirls themselves had never heard that their mother had been a slave, and\ntherefore knew nothing of the danger hanging over their heads.\n\nAn inventory of the property of the deceased was made out by Mr. Morton,\nand placed in the hands of the creditors. These preliminaries being\narranged, the ladies, with their relative, concluded to leave the city\nand reside for a few days on the banks of Lake Ponchartrain, where they\ncould enjoy a fresh air that the city did not afford. As they were\nabout taking the cars, however, an officer arrested the whole party--the\nladies as slaves, and the gentleman upon the charge of attempting to\nconceal the property of his deceased brother. Mr. Morton was overwhelmed\nwith horror at the idea of his nieces being claimed as slaves, and asked\nfor time, that he might save them from such a fate. He even offered\nto mortgage his little farm in Vermont for the amount which young\nslave-women of their ages would fetch. But the creditors pleaded that\nthey were an “extra article,” and would sell for more than common\nslaves, and must therefore be sold at auction.\n\nThe uncle was therefore compelled to give them up to the officers of the\nlaw, and they were separated from him. Jane, the oldest of the girls, as\nwe have before mentioned, was very handsome, bearing a close resemblance\nto her cousin Clotelle. Alreka, though not as handsome as her sister,\nwas nevertheless a beautiful girl, and both had all the accomplishments\nthat wealth and station could procure.\n\nThough only in her fifteen year, Alreka had become strongly attached to\nVolney Lapie, a young Frenchman, a student in her father's office. This\nattachment was reciprocated, although the poverty of the young man and\nthe extreme youth of the girl had caused their feelings to be kept from\nthe young lady's parents.\n\nThe day of sale came, and Mr. Morton attended, with the hope that either\nthe magnanimity of the creditors or his own little farm in Vermont might\nsave his nieces from the fate that awaited them. His hope, however, was\nin vain. The feelings of all present seemed to be lost in the general\nwish to become the possessor of the young ladies, who stood trembling,\nblushing, and weeping as the numerous throng gazed at them, or as the\nintended purchaser examined the graceful proportions of their fair and\nbeautiful frames. Neither the presence of the uncle nor young Lapie\ncould at all lessen the gross language of the officers, or stay the rude\nhands of those who wishes to examine the property thus offered for sale.\nAfter a fierce contest between the bidders, the girls were sold, one for\ntwo thousand three hundred, and the other for two thousand three hundred\nand fifty dollars. Had these girls been bought for servants only, they\nwould in all probability have brought not more than nine hundred or a\nthousand dollars each. Here were two beautiful young girls, accustomed\nto the fondest indulgence, surrounded by all the refinements of life,\nand with the timidity and gentleness which such a life would naturally\nproduce, bartered away like cattle in the markets of Smithfield or New\nYork.\n\nThe mother, who was also to have been sold, happily followed her husband\nto the grave, and was spared the pangs of a broken heart.\n\nThe purchaser of the young ladies left the market in triumph, and the\nuncle, with a heavy heart, started for his New England home, with no\nearthly prospect of ever beholding his nieces again.\n\nThe seizure of the young ladies as slaves was the result of the\nadministrator's having found among Dr. Morton's papers the bill-of-sale\nof Marion which he had taken when he purchased her. He had doubtless\nintended to liberate her when he married her, but had neglected from\ntime to time to have the proper papers made out. Sad was the result of\nthis negligence.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV. THE FLIGHT\n\n\nON once gaining the wharf, Devenant and Clotelle found no difficulty in\nsecuring an immediate passage to France. The fine packet-ship Utica lay\ndown the bay, and only awaited the return of the lighter that night to\ncomplete her cargo and list of passengers, ere she departed. The young\nFrenchman therefore took his prize on board, and started for the ship.\n\nDaylight was just making its appearance the next morning when the Utica\nweighed anchor and turned her prow toward the sea. In the course of\nthree hours, the vessel, with outspread sails, was rapidly flying from\nland. Everything appeared to be auspicious. The skies were beautifully\nclear, and the sea calm, with a sun that dazzled the whole scene. But\nclouds soon began to chase each other through the heavens, and the sea\nbecame rough. It was then that Clotelle felt that there was hoped of\nescaping. She had hitherto kept in the cabin, but now she expressed a\nwish to come on deck. The hanging clouds were narrowing the horizon to\na span, and gloomily mingling with the rising surges. The old and\ngrave-looking seamen shook their weather-wise heads as if foretelling a\nstorm.\n\nAs Clotelle came on deck, she strained her eyes in vain to catch a\nfarewell view of her native land. With a smile on her countenance, but\nwith her eyes filled with tears, she said,--\n\n“Farewell, farewell to the land of my birth, and welcome, welcome, ye\ndark blue waves. I care not where I go, so it is\n\n     'Where a tyrant never trod,\n       Where a slave was never known,\n      But where nature worships God,\n       If in the wilderness alone.'”\n\nDevenant stood by her side, seeming proud of his future wife, with his\nface in a glow at his success, while over his noble brow clustering\nlocks of glossy black hair were hanging in careless ringlets. His\nfinely-cut, classic features wore the aspect of one possessed with a\nlarge and noble heart.\n\nOnce more the beautiful Clotelle whispered in the ear of her lover,--\n\n     “Away, away, o'er land and sea,\n      America is now no home for me.”\n\nThe winds increased with nightfall, and impenetrable gloom surrounded\nthe ship. The prospect was too uncheering, even to persons in love.\nThe attention which Devenant paid to Clotelle, although she had been\nregistered on the ship's passenger list as his sister, caused more than\none to look upon his as an agreeable travelling companion. His tall,\nslender figure and fine countenance bespoke for him at first sight one's\nconfidence. That he was sincerely and deeply enamored of Clotelle all\ncould see.\n\nThe weather became still more squally. The wind rushed through the\nwhite, foaming waves, and the ship groaned with its own wild and\nungovernable labors, while nothing could be seen but the wild waste of\nwaters. The scene was indeed one of fearful sublimity.\n\nDay came and went without any abatement of the storm. Despair was now on\nevery countenance. Occasionally a vivid flash of lightning would break\nforth and illuminate the black and boiling surges that surrounded the\nvessel, which was now scudding before the blast under bare poles.\n\nAfter five days of most intensely stormy weather, the sea settled down\ninto a dead calm, and the passengers flocked on deck. During the last\nthree days of the storm, Clotelle had been so unwell as to be unable to\nraise her head. Her pale face and quivering lips and languid appearance\nmade her look as if every pulsation had ceased. Her magnificent large\nand soft eyes, fringed with lashes as dark as night, gave her an angelic\nappearance. The unreserved attention of Devenant, even when sea-sick\nhimself, did much to increase the little love that the at first\ndistrustful girl had placed in him. The heart must always have some\nobject on which to centre its affections, and Clotelle having lost all\nhope of ever again seeing Jerome, it was but natural that she should now\ntransfer her love to one who was so greatly befriending her. At first\nshe respected Devenant for the love he manifested for her, and for his\napparent willingness to make any sacrifice for her welfare. True, this\nwas an adventure upon which she had risked her all, and should her heart\nbe foiled in this search for hidden treasures, her affections would be\nshipwrecked forever. She felt under great obligations to the man who had\nthus effected her escape, and that noble act alone would entitle him to\nher love.\n\nEach day became more pleasant as the noble ship sped onward amid the\nrippled spray. The whistling of the breeze through the rigging was music\nto the ear, and brought gladness to the heart of every one on board. At\nlast, the long suspense was broken by the appearance of land, at which\nall hearts leaped for joy. It was a beautiful morning in October. The\nsun had just risen, and sky and earth were still bathed in his soft,\nrosy glow, when the Utica hauled into the dock at Bordeaux. The\nsplendid streets, beautiful bridges, glittering equipages, and smiling\ncountenances of the people, gave everything a happy appearance, after a\nvoyage of twenty-nine days on the deep, deep sea.\n\nAfter getting their baggage cleared from the custom-house and going to a\nhotel, Devenant made immediate arrangements for the marriage. Clotelle,\non arriving at the church where the ceremony was to take place, was\ncompletely overwhelmed at the spectacle. She had never beheld a scene so\ngorgeous as this. The magnificent dresses of the priests and choristers,\nthe deep and solemn voices, the elevated crucifix, the burning tapers,\nthe splendidly decorated altar, the sweet-smelling incense, made the\noccasion truly an imposing one. At the conclusion of the ceremony, the\nloud and solemn peals of the organ's swelling anthem were lost to all in\nthe contemplation of the interesting scene.\n\nThe happy couple set out at once for Dunkirk, the residence of the\nbridegroom's parents. But their stay there was short, for they had\nscarcely commenced visiting the numerous friends of the husband ere\norders came for him to proceed to India to join that portion of the\nFrench army then stationed there.\n\nIn due course of time they left for India, passing through Paris and\nLyons, taking ship at Marseilles. In the metropolis of France, they\nspent a week, where the husband took delight in introducing his wife\nto his brother officers in the French army, and where the newly-married\ncouple were introduced to Louis Philippe, then King of France. In all of\nthese positions, Clotelle sustained herself in a most ladylike manner.\n\nAt Lyons, they visited the vast factories and other public works, and\nall was pleasure with them. The voyage from Marseilles to Calcutta\nwas very pleasant, as the weather was exceedingly fine. On arriving in\nIndia, Captain Devenant and lady were received with honors--the former\nfor his heroic bravery in more than one battle, and the latter for\nher fascinating beauty and pleasing manners, and the fact that she\nwas connected with one who was a general favorite with all who had his\nacquaintance. This was indeed a great change for Clotelle. Six months\nhad not elapsed since her exposure in the slave-market of New Orleans.\nThis life is a stage, and we are indeed all actors.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI. THE HERO OF A NIGHT\n\n\nMOUNTED on a fast horse, with the Quaker's son for a guide, Jerome\npressed forward while Uncle Joseph was detaining the slave-catchers at\nthe barn-door, through which the fugitive had just escaped. When out of\npresent danger, fearing that suspicion might be aroused if he continued\non the road in open day, Jerome buried himself in a thick, dark forest\nuntil nightfall. With a yearning heart, he saw the splendor of the\nsetting sun lingering on the hills, as if loath to fade away and be lost\nin the more sombre hues of twilight, which, rising from the east, was\nslowly stealing over the expanse of heaven, bearing silence and repose,\nwhich should cover his flight from a neighborhood to him so full of\ndangers.\n\nWearily and alone, with nothing but the hope of safety before him to\ncheer him on his way, the poor fugitive urged his tired and trembling\nlimbs forward for several nights. The new suit of clothes with which he\nhad provided himself when he made his escape from his captors, and the\ntwenty dollars which the young Quaker had slipped into his hand, when\nbidding him “Fare thee well,” would enable him to appear genteelly as\nsoon as he dared to travel by daylight, and would thus facilitate his\nprogress toward freedom.\n\nIt was late in the evening when the fugitive slave arrived at a small\ntown on the banks of Lake Erie, where he was to remain over night. How\nstrange were his feelings! While his heart throbbed for that freedom and\nsafety which Canada alone could furnish to the whip-scarred slave, on\nthe American continent, his thoughts were with Clotelle. Was she still\nin prison, and if so, what would be her punishment for aiding him to\nescape from prison? Would he ever behold her again? These were the\nthoughts that followed him to his pillow, haunted him in his dreams, and\nawakened him from his slumbers.\n\nThe alarm of fire aroused the inmates of the hotel in which Jerome had\nsought shelter for the night from the deep sleep into which they had\nfallen. The whole village was buried in slumber, and the building was\nhalf consumed before the frightened inhabitants had reached the scene of\nthe conflagration. The wind was high, and the burning embers were wafted\nlike so many rockets through the sky. The whole town was lighted up, and\nthe cries of women and children in the streets made the scene a terrific\none. Jerome heard the alarm, and hastily dressing himself, he went forth\nand hastened toward the burning building.\n\n“There,--there in that room in the second story, is my child!” exclaimed\na woman, wringing her hands, and imploring some one to go to the rescue\nof her little one.\n\nThe broad sheets of fire were flying in the direction of the chamber\nin which the child was sleeping, and all hope of its being saved seemed\ngone. Occasionally the wind would life the pall of smoke, and show that\nthe work of destruction was not yet complete. At last a long ladder was\nbrought, and one end placed under the window of the room. A moment more\nand a bystander mounted the ladder and ascended in haste to the window.\nThe smoke met him as he raised the sash, and he cried out, “All is\nlost!” and returned to the ground without entering the room.\n\nAnother sweep of the wind showed that the destroying element had not yet\nmade its final visit to that part of the doomed building. The mother,\nseeing that all hope of again meeting her child in this world was gone,\nwrung her hands and seemed inconsolable with grief.\n\nAt this juncture, a man was seen to mount the ladder, and ascend with\ngreat rapidity. All eyes were instantly turned to the figure of this\nunknown individual as it disappeared in the cloud of smoke escaping from\nthe window. Those who a moment before had been removing furniture, as\nwell as the idlers who had congregated at the ringing of the bells,\nassembled at the foot of the ladder, and awaited with breathless silence\nthe reappearance of the stranger, who, regardless of his own safety, had\nthus risked his life to save another's. Three cheers broke the stillness\nthat had fallen on the company, as the brave man was seen coming through\nthe window and slowly descending to the ground holding under one arm the\ninanimate form of the child. Another cheer and then another, made the\nwelkin ring, as the stranger, with hair burned and eyebrows closely\nsinged, fainted at the foot of the ladder. But the child was saved.\n\nThe stranger was Jerome. As soon as he revived, he shrunk from every\neye, as if he feared they would take from him the freedom which he had\ngone through so much to obtain.\n\nThe next day, the fugitive took a vessel, and the following morning\nfound himself standing on the free soil of Canada. As his foot pressed\nthe shore, he threw himself upon his face, kissed the earth, and\nexclaimed, “O God! I thank thee that I am a free man.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII. TRUE FREEDOM\n\nTHE history of the African race is God's illuminated clock, set in the\ndark steeple of time. The negro has been made the hewer of wood and the\ndrawer of water for nearly all other nations. The people of the United\nStates, however, will have an account to settle with God, owing to their\ntreatment of the negro, which will far surpass the rest of mankind.\n\nJerome, on reaching Canada, felt for the first time that personal\nfreedom which God intended that all who bore his image should enjoy.\nThat same forgetfulness of self which had always characterized him now\ncaused him to think of others. The thoughts of dear ones in slavery were\ncontinually in his mind, and above all others, Clotelle occupied his\nthoughts. Now that he was free, he could better appreciate her condition\nas a slave. Although Jerome met, on his arrival in Canada, numbers who\nhad escaped from the Southern States, he nevertheless shrank from all\nsociety, particularly that of females. The soft, silver-gray tints on\nthe leaves of the trees, with their snow-spotted trunks, and a biting\nair, warned the new-born freeman that he was in another climate. Jerome\nsought work, and soon found it; and arranged with his employer that the\nlatter should go to Natchez in search of Clotelle. The good Scotchman,\nfor whom the fugitive was laboring, freely offered to go down and\npurchase the girl, if she could be bought, and let Jerome pay him in\nwork. With such a prospect of future happiness in view, this injured\ndescendent of outraged and bleeding Africa went daily to his toil with\nan energy hitherto unknown to him. But oh, how vain are the hopes of\nman!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII. FAREWELL TO AMERICA\n\n\nTHREE months had elapsed, from the time the fugitive commenced work for\nMr. Streeter, when that gentleman returned from his Southern research,\nand informed Jerome that Parson Wilson had sold Clotelle, and that she\nhad been sent to the New Orleans slave-market.\n\nThis intelligence fell with crushing weight upon the heart of Jerome,\nand he now felt that the last chain which bound him to his native land\nwas severed. He therefore determined to leave America forever. His\nnearest and dearest friends had often been flogged in his very presence,\nand he had seen his mother sold to the negro-trader. An only sister\nhad been torn from him by the soul-driver; he had himself been sold\nand resold, and been compelled to submit to the most degrading and\nhumiliating insults; and now that the woman upon whom his heart doted,\nand without whom life was a burden, had been taken away forever, he felt\nit a duty to hate all mankind.\n\nIf there is one thing more than another calculated to make one hate and\ndetest American slavery, it is to witness the meetings between fugitives\nand their friends in Canada. Jerome had beheld some of these scenes. The\nwife who, after years of separation, had escaped from her prison-house\nand followed her husband had told her story to him. He had seen the\nnewly-arrived wife rush into the arms of the husband, whose dark face\nshe had not looked upon for long, weary years. Some told of how a sister\nhad been ill-used by the overseer; others of a husband's being whipped\nto death for having attempted to protect his wife. He had sat in the\nlittle log-hut, by the fireside, and heard tales that caused his heart\nto bleed; and his bosom swelled with just indignation when he though\nthat there was no remedy for such atrocious acts. It was with such\nfeelings that he informed his employer that he should leave him at the\nexpiration of a month.\n\nIn vain did Mr. Streeter try to persuade Jerome to remain with him; and\nlate in the month of February, the latter found himself on board a small\nvessel loaded with pine-lumber, descending the St. Lawrence, bound for\nLiverpool. The bark, though an old one, was, nevertheless, considered\nseaworthy, and the fugitive was working his way out. As the vessel left\nthe river and gained the open sea, the black man appeared to rejoice at\nthe prospect of leaving a country in which his right to manhood had been\ndenied him, and his happiness destroyed.\n\nThe wind was proudly swelling the white sails, and the little craft\nplunging into the foaming waves, with the land fast receding in the\ndistance, when Jerome mounted a pile of lumber to take a last farewell\nof his native land. With tears glistening in his eyes, and with\nquivering lips, he turned his gaze toward the shores that were fast\nfading in the dim distance, and said,--\n\n“Though forced from my native land by the tyrants of the South, I hope I\nshall some day be able to return. With all her faults, I love my country\nstill.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX. A STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND\n\n\nTHE rain was falling on the dirty pavements of Liverpool as Jerome left\nthe vessel after her arrival. Passing the custom-house, he took a cab,\nand proceeded to Brown's Hotel, Clayton Square.\n\nFinding no employment in Liverpool, Jerome determined to go into the\ninterior and seek for work. He, therefore, called for his bill, and made\nready for his departure. Although but four days at the Albion, he found\nthe hotel charges larger than he expected; but a stranger generally\ncounts on being “fleeced” in travelling through the Old World, and\nespecially in Great Britain. After paying his bill, he was about leaving\nthe room, when one of the servants presented himself with a low bow, and\nsaid,--\n\n“Something for the waiter, sir?”\n\n“I thought I had paid my bill,” replied the man, somewhat surprised at\nthis polite dun.\n\n“I am the waiter, sir, and gets only what strangers see fit to give me.”\n\nTaking from his pocket his nearly empty purse, Jerome handed the man a\nhalf-crown; but he had hardly restored it to his pocket, before his eye\nfell on another man in the waiting costume.\n\n“What do you want?” he asked.\n\n“Whatever your honor sees fit to give me, sir. I am the tother waiter.”\n\nThe purse was again taken from the pocket, and another half-crown handed\nout. Stepping out into the hall, he saw standing there a good-looking\nwoman, in a white apron, who made a very pretty courtesy.\n\n“What's your business?” he inquired.\n\n“I am the chambermaid, sir, and looks after the gentlemen's beds.”\n\nOut came the purse again, and was relieved of another half-crown;\nwhereupon another girl, with a fascinating smile, took the place of the\none who had just received her fee.\n\n“What do you want?” demanded the now half-angry Jerome.\n\n“Please, sir, I am the tother chambermaid.”\n\nFinding it easier to give shillings than half-crowns, Jerome handed the\nwoman a shilling, and again restored his purse to his pocket, glad that\nanother woman was not to be seen.\n\nScarcely had he commenced congratulating himself, however, before three\nmen made their appearance, one after another.\n\n“What have _you_ done for me?” he asked of the first.\n\n“I am the boots, sir.”\n\nThe purse came out once more, and a shilling was deposited in the\nservant's hand.\n\n“What do I owe you?” he inquired of the second.\n\n“I took your honor's letter to the post, yesterday, sir.”\n\nAnother shilling left the purse.\n\n“In the name of the Lord, what am I indebted to you for?” demanded\nJerome, now entirely out of patience, turning to the last of the trio.\n\n“I told yer vership vot time it vas, this morning.”\n\n“Well!” exclaimed the indignant man, “ask here who o'clock it is, and\nyou have got to pay for it.”\n\nHe paid this last demand with a sixpence, regretting that he had not\ncommenced with sixpences instead of half-crowns.\n\nHaving cleared off all demands in the house, he started for the railway\nstation; but had scarcely reached the street, before he was accosted by\nan old man with a broom in his hand, who, with an exceedingly low bow,\nsaid,--\n\n“I is here, yer lordship.”\n\n“I did not send for you; what is your business?” demanded Jerome.\n\n“I is the man what opened your lordship's cab-door, when your lordship\ncame to the house on Monday last, and I know your honor won't allow a\npoor man to starve.”\n\nPutting a sixpence in the old man's hand, Jerome once more started\nfor the depot. Having obtained letters of introduction to persons in\nManchester, he found no difficulty in getting a situation in a large\nmanufacturing house there. Although the salary was small, yet the\nsituation was a much better one than he had hoped to obtain. His\ncompensation as out-door clerk enabled him to employ a man to teach him\nat night, and, by continued study and attention to business, he was soon\npromoted.\n\nAfter three years in his new home, Jerome was placed in a still higher\nposition, where his salary amounted to fifteen hundred dollars a year.\nThe drinking, smoking, and other expensive habits, which the clerks\nusually indulged in, he carefully avoided.\n\nBeing fond of poetry, he turned his attention to literature. Johnson's\n“Lives of the Poets,” the writings of Dryden, Addison, Pope, Clarendon,\nand other authors of celebrity, he read with attention. The knowledge\nwhich he thus picked up during his leisure hours gave him a great\nadvantage over the other clerks, and caused his employers to respect\nhim far more than any other in their establishment. So eager was he to\nimprove the time that he determined to see how much he could read during\nthe unemployed time of night and morning, and his success was beyond his\nexpectations.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX. NEW FRIENDS\n\n\nBROKEN down in health, after ten years of close confinement in his\nsituation, Jerome resolved to give it up, and thereby release himself\nfrom an employment which seemed calculated to send him to a premature\ngrave.\n\nIt was on a beautiful morning in summer that he started for Scotland,\nhaving made up his mind to travel for his health. After visiting\nEdinburgh and Glasgow, he concluded to spend a few days in the old town\nof Perth, with a friend whose acquaintance he had made in Manchester.\nDuring the second day of his stay in Perth, while crossing the main\nstreet, Jerome saw a pony-chaise coming toward him with great speed. A\nlady, who appeared to be the only occupant of the vehicle, was using\nher utmost strength to stop the frightened horses. The footman, in his\nfright, had leaped from behind the carriage, and was following with\nthe crowd. With that self-forgetfulness which was one of his chief\ncharacteristics, Jerome threw himself before the horses to stop them;\nand, seizing the high-spirited animals by the bit, as they dashed by\nhim, he was dragged several rods before their speed was checked, which\nwas not accomplished until one of the horses had fallen to the ground,\nwith the heroic man struggling beneath him.\n\nAll present were satisfied that this daring act alone had saved the\nlady's life, for the chaise must inevitably have been dashed in pieces,\nhad the horses not been thus suddenly checked in their mad career.\n\nOn the morning following this perilous adventure, Col. G--called at\nJerome's temporary residence, and, after expressing his admiration for\nhis noble daring, and thanking him for having saved his daughter's life,\ninvited him to visit him at his country residence. This invitation was\npromptly accepted in the spirit in which it was given; and three days\nafter, Jerome found himself at the princely residence of the father\nof the lady for whose safety he had risked his own life. The house was\nsurrounded by fine trees, and a sweet little stream ran murmuring at the\nfoot, while beds of flowers on every hand shed their odors on the summer\nair. It was, indeed, a pleasant place to spend the warm weather, and\nthe colonel and his family gave Jerome a most cordial welcome. Miss G.\nshowed especial attention to the stranger. He had not intended remaining\nlonger than the following day: but the family insisted on his taking\npart in a fox-hunt that was to come off on the morning of the third day.\nWishing to witness a scene as interesting as the chase usually proves to\nbe, he decided to remain.\n\nFifteen persons, five of whom were ladies, were on the ground at the\nappointed hour. Miss G. was, of course, one of the party. In vain Jerome\nendeavored to excuse himself from joining in the chase. His plea of\nill-health was only met by smiles from the young ladies, and the reply\nthat a ride would effect a cure.\n\nDressed in a scarlet coat and high boots, with the low, round cap worn\nin the chase, Jerome mounted a high-spirited horse, whip in hand, and\nmade himself one of the party. In America, riding is a necessity; in\nEngland, it is a pleasure. Young men and women attend riding-school in\nour fatherland, and consider that they are studying a science. Jerome\nwas no rider. He had not been on horseback for more than ten years, and\nas soon as he mounted, every one saw that he was a novice, and a smile\nwas on the countenance of each member of the company.\n\nThe blowing of the horn, and assembling of the hounds, and finally the\nrelease of the fox from his close prison, were the signals for the chase\nto commence. The first half-mile the little animal took his course over\na beautiful field where there was neither hedge nor ditch. Thus far the\nchase was enjoyed by all, even by the American rider, who was better\nfitted to witness the scene than to take part in it.\n\nWe left Jerome in our last reluctantly engaged in the chase; and though\nthe first mile or so of the pursuit, which was over smooth meadow-land,\nhad had an exhilarating effect upon his mind, and tended somewhat\nto relieve him of the embarrassment consequent upon his position,\nhe nevertheless still felt that he was far from being in his proper\nelement. Besides, the fox had now made for a dense forest which lay\nbefore, and he saw difficulties in that direction which to him appeared\ninsurmountable.\n\nAway went the huntsmen, over stone walls, high fences, and deep ditches.\nJerome saw the ladies even leading the gentlemen, but this could not\ninspire him. They cleared the fences, four and five feet high with\nperfect ease, showing they were quite at home in the saddle. But alas\nfor the poor American! As his fine steed came up to the first fence, and\nwas about to make the leap, Jerome pulled at the bridle, and cried at\nthe top of his voice, “Whoa! whoa! whoa!” the horse at the same time\ncapering about, and appearing determined to keep up with the other\nanimals.\n\nAway dashed the huntsmen, following the hounds, and all were soon lost\nto the view of their colored companion. Jerome rode up and down the\nfield looking for a gate or bars, that he might get through without\nrisking his neck. Finding, however, that all hope of again catching up\nwith the party was out of the question, he determined to return to the\nhouse, under a plea of sudden illness, and back he accordingly went.\n\n“I hope no accident has happened to your honor,” said the groom, as he\nmet our hero at the gate.\n\n“A slight dizziness,” was the answer.\n\nOne of the servants, without being ordered, went at once for the family\nphysician. Ashamed to own that his return was owing to his inability\nto ride, Jerome resolved to feign sickness. The doctor came, felt\nhis pulse, examined his tongue, and pronounced him a sick man. He\nimmediately ordered a tepid bath, and sent for a couple of leeches.\n\nSeeing things taking such a serious turn, the American began to regret\nthe part he was playing; for there was no fun in being rubbed and\nleeched when one was in perfect health. He had gone too far to recede,\nhowever, and so submitted quietly to the directions of the doctor; and,\nafter following the injunctions given by that learned Esculapius, was\nput to bed.\n\nShortly after, the sound of the horns and the yelp of the hounds\nannounced that the poor fox had taken the back track, and was repassing\nnear the house. Even the pleasure of witnessing the beautiful sight from\nthe window was denied our hero; for the physician had ordered that he\nmust be kept in perfect quiet.\n\nThe chase was at last over, and the huntsmen all in, sympathizing with\ntheir lost companion. After nine days of sweating, blistering, and\nleeching, Jerome left his bed convalescent, but much reduced in flesh\nand strength. This was his first and last attempt to follow the fox and\nhounds.\n\nDuring his fortnight's stay at Colonel G.', Jerome spent most of his\ntime in the magnificent library. Claude did not watch with more interest\nevery color of the skies, the trees, the grass, and the water, to learn\nfrom nature, than did this son of a despised race search books to obtain\nthat knowledge which his early life as a slave had denied him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI. THE MYSTERIOUS MEETING\n\n\nAFTER more than a fortnight spent in the highlands of Scotland, Jerome\npassed hastily through London on his way to the continent.\n\nIt was toward sunset, on a warm day in October, shortly after his\narrival in France, that, after strolling some distance from the Hotel\nde Leon, in the old and picturesque town of Dunkirk, he entered a\nburial-ground--such places being always favorite walks with him--and\nwandered around among the silent dead. All nature around was hushed in\nsilence, and seemed to partake of the general melancholy that hung over\nthe quiet resting-place of the departed. Even the birds seemed imbued\nwith the spirit of the place, for they were silent, either flying\nnoiselessly over the graves, or jumping about in the tall grass. After\ntracing the various inscriptions that told the characters and conditions\nof the deceased, and viewing the mounds beneath which the dust of\nmortality slumbered, he arrived at a secluded spot near where an aged\nweeping willow bowed its thick foliage to the ground, as though anxious\nto hide from the scrutinizing gaze of curiosity the grave beneath it.\nJerome seated himself on a marble tombstone, and commenced reading from\na book which he had carried under his arm. It was now twilight, and\nhe had read but a few minutes when he observed a lady, attired in deep\nblack, and leading a boy, apparently some five or six years old, coming\nup one of the beautiful, winding paths. As the lady's veil was drawn\nclosely over her face, he felt somewhat at liberty to eye her more\nclosely. While thus engaged, the lady gave a slight scream, and seemed\nsuddenly to have fallen into a fainting condition. Jerome sprang from\nhis seat, and caught her in time to save her from falling to the ground.\n\nAt this moment an elderly gentleman, also dressed in black, was seen\napproaching with a hurried step, which seemed to indicate that he was in\nsome way connected with the lady. The old man came up, and in rather a\nconfused manner inquired what had happened, and Jerome explained matters\nas well as he was able to do so. After taking up the vinaigrette, which\nhad fallen from her hand, and holding the bottle a short time to her\nface, the lady began to revive. During all this time, the veil had still\npartly covered the face of the fair one, so that Jerome had scarcely\nseen it. When she had so far recovered as to be able to look around her,\nshe raised herself slightly, and again screamed and swooned. The old man\nnow feeling satisfied that Jerome's dark complexion was the immediate\ncause of the catastrophe, said in a somewhat petulant tone,--\n\n“I will be glad, sir, if you will leave us alone.”\n\nThe little boy at this juncture set up a loud cry, and amid the general\nconfusion, Jerome left the ground and returned to his hotel.\n\nWhile seated at the window of his room looking out upon the crowded\nstreet, with every now and then the strange scene in the graveyard\nvividly before him, Jerome suddenly thought of the book he had been\nreading, and, remembering that he had left it on the tombstone, where he\ndropped it when called to the lady's assistance, he determined to return\nfor it at once.\n\nAfter a walk of some twenty minutes, he found himself again in the\nburial-ground and on the spot where he had been an hour before. The\npensive moon was already up, and its soft light was sleeping on the\nlittle pond at the back of the grounds, while the stars seemed smiling\nat their own sparkling rays gleaming up from the beautiful sheet of\nwater.\n\nJerome searched in vain for his book; it was nowhere to be found.\nNothing, save the bouquet that the lady had dropped, and which lay\nhalf-buried in the grass, from having been trodden upon, indicated that\nany one had been there that evening. The stillness of death reigned over\nthe place; even the little birds, that had before been twittering and\nflying about, had retired for the night.\n\nTaking up the bunch of flowers, Jerome returned to his hotel. “What can\nthis mean?” he would ask himself; “and why should they take my book?”\n These questions he put to himself again and again during his walk. His\nsleep was broken more than once that night, and he welcomed the early\ndawn as it made its appearance.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII. THE HAPPY MEETING\n\n\nAFTER passing a sleepless night, and hearing the clock strike six,\nJerome took from his table a book, and thus endeavored to pass away the\nhours before breakfast-time. While thus engaged, a servant entered and\nhanded him a note. Hastily tearing it open, Jerome read as follows:--\n\n\n  “SIR,--I owe you an apology for the abrupt manner in which I addressed\n  you last evening, and the inconvenience to which you were subjected\n  by some of my household.  If you will honor us with your presence to-day\n  at four o'clock, I will be most happy to give you due satisfaction.\n  My servant will be waiting with the carriage at half-past three.\n\n  “I am, sir, yours, &c.,\n\n  “J. DEVENANT”\n\n\n  “JEROME FLETCHER, Esq.”\n\n\nWho this gentleman was, and how he had found out his name and the hotel\nat which he was stopping, were alike mysteries to Jerome. And this note\nseemed to his puzzled brain like a challenge. “Satisfaction?” He had not\nasked for satisfaction. However, he resolved to accept the invitation,\nand, if need be, meet the worst. At any rate, this most mysterious and\ncomplicated affair would be explained.\n\nThe clock on a neighboring church had scarcely finished striking three\nwhen a servant announced to Jerome that a carriage had called for him.\nIn a few minutes, he was seated in a sumptuous barouche, drawn by a\npair of beautiful iron-grays, and rolling over a splendid gravel road\nentirely shaded by trees, which appeared to have been the accumulated\ngrowth of many centuries. The carriage soon stopped at a low villa,\nwhich was completely embowered in trees.\n\nJerome alighted, and was shown into a superb room, with the walls finely\ndecorated with splendid tapestry, and the ceilings exquisitely frescoed.\nThe walls were hung with fine specimens from the hands of the great\nItalian masters, and one by a German artist, representing a beautiful\nmonkish legend connected with the “Holy Catharine,” an illustrious lady\nof Alexandria. High-backed chairs stood around the room, rich curtains\nof crimson damask hung in folds on either side of the window, and a\nbeautiful, rick, Turkey carpet covered the floor. In the centre of the\nroom stood a table covered with books, in the midst of which was a\nvase of fresh flowers, loading the atmosphere with their odors. A\nfaint light, together with the quiet of the hour, gave beauty beyond\ndescription to the whole scene. A half-open door showed a fine marble\nfloor to an adjoining room, with pictures, statues, and antiquated\nsofas, and flower-pots filled with rare plants of every kind and\ndescription.\n\nJerome had scarcely run his eyes over the beauties of the room when\nthe elderly gentleman whom he had met on the previous evening made his\nappearance, followed by the little boy, and introduced himself as Mr.\nDevenant. A moment more and a lady, a beautiful brunette, dressed in\nblack, with long black curls hanging over her shoulders, entered the\nroom. Her dark, bright eyes flashed as she caught the first sight of\nJerome. The gentleman immediately arose on the entrance of the lady, and\nMr. Devenant was in the act of introducing the stranger when he observed\nthat Jerome had sunk back upon the sofa, in a faint voice exclaiming,--\n\n“It is she!”\n\nAfter this, all was dark and dreary. How long he remained in this\ncondition, it was for others to tell. The lady knelt by his side and\nwept; and when he came to, he found himself stretched upon the sofa with\nhis boots off and his head resting upon a pillow. By his side sat the\nold man, with the smelling-bottle in one hand and a glass of water in\nthe other, while the little boy stood at the foot of the sofa. As soon\nas Jerome had so far recovered as to be able to speak, he said,--\n\n“Where am I, and what does all this mean?”\n\n“Wait awhile,” replied the old man, “and I will tell you all.”\n\nAfter the lapse of some ten minutes, Jerome arose from the sofa,\nadjusted his apparel, and said,--\n\n“I am now ready to hear anything you have to say.”\n\n“You were born in America?” said the old man.\n\n“I was,” he replied.\n\n“And you knew a girl named Clotelle,” continued the old man.\n\n“Yes, and I loved her as I can love none other.”\n\n“The lady whom you met so mysteriously last evening was she,” said Mr.\nDevenant.\n\nJerome was silent, but the fountain of mingled grief and joy stole out\nfrom beneath his eyelashes, and glistened like pearls upon his ebony\ncheeks.\n\nAt this juncture, the lady again entered the room. With an enthusiasm\nthat can be better imagined than described, Jerome sprang from the sofa,\nand they rushed into each other's arms, to the great surprise of the old\ngentleman and little Antoine, and to the amusement of the servants who\nhad crept up, one by one and were hid behind the doors or loitering in\nthe hall. When they had given vent to their feelings and sufficiently\nrecovered their presence of mind, they resumed their seats.\n\n“How did you find out my name and address?” inquired Jerome.\n\n“After you had left the grave-yard,” replied Clotelle, “our little boy\nsaid, 'Oh, mamma! if there ain't a book!' I opened the book, and saw\nyour name written in it, and also found a card of the Hotel de Leon.\nPapa wished to leave the book, and said it was only a fancy of mine that\nI had ever seen you before; but I was perfectly convinced that you were\nmy own dear Jerome.”\n\nAs she uttered the last words, tears--the sweet bright tears that love\nalone can bring forth--bedewed her cheeks.\n\n“Are you married?” now inquired Clotelle, with a palpitating heart and\ntrembling voice.\n\n“No, I am not, and never have been,” was Jerome's reply.\n\n“Then, thank God!” she exclaimed, in broken accents.\n\nIt was then that hope gleamed up amid the crushed and broken flowers of\nher heart, and a bright flash darted forth like a sunbeam.\n\n“Are you single now?” asked Jerome.\n\n“Yes, I am,” was the answer.\n\n“Then you will be mine after all?” said he with a smile.\n\nHer dark, rich hair had partly come down, and hung still more loosely\nover her shoulders than when she first appeared; and her eyes, now full\nof animation and vivacity, and her sweet, harmonious, and well-modulated\nvoice, together with her modesty, self-possession, and engaging manners,\nmade Clotelle appear lovely beyond description. Although past the age\nwhen men ought to think of matrimony, yet the scene before Mr. Devenant\nbrought vividly to his mind the time when he was young and had a loving\nbosom companion living, and tears were wiped from the old man's eyes. A\nnew world seemed to unfold itself before the eyes of the happy lovers,\nand they were completely absorbed in contemplating the future. Furnished\nby nature with a disposition to study, and a memory so retentive that\nall who knew her were surprised at the ease with which she acquired her\neducation and general information, Clotelle might now be termed a\nmost accomplished lady. After her marriage with young Devenant, they\nproceeded to India, where the husband's regiment was stationed. Soomn\nafter their arrival, however, a battle was fought with the natives, in\nwhich several officers fell, among whom was Captain Devenant. The father\nof the young captain being there at the time, took his daughter-in-law\nand brought her back to France, where they took up their abode at the\nold homestead. Old Mr. Devenant was possessed of a large fortune, all of\nwhich he intended for his daughter-in-law and her only child.\n\nAlthough Clotelle had married young Devenant, she had not forgotten her\nfirst love, and her father-in-law now willingly gave his consent to her\nmarriage with Jerome. Jerome felt that to possess the woman of his love,\neven at that late hour, was compensation enough for the years that he\nhad been separated from her, and Clotelle wanted no better evidence of\nhis love for her than the fact of his having remained so long unmarried.\nIt was indeed a rare instance of devotion and constancy in a man, and\nthe young widow gratefully appreciated it.\n\nIt was late in the evening when Jerome led his intended bride to the\nwindow, and the magnificent moonlight illuminated the countenance of the\nlovely Clotelle, while inward sunshine, emanating from a mind at ease,\nand her own virtuous thoughts, gave brightness to her eyes and made her\nappear a very angel. This was the first evening that Jerome had been in\nher company since the night when, to effect his escape from prison,\nshe disguised herself in male attire. How different the scene now. Free\ninstead of slaves, wealthy instead of poor, and on the eve of an event\nthat seemed likely to result in a life of happiness to both.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII. THE HAPPY DAY\n\n\nIT was a bright day in the latter part of October that Jerome and\nClotelle set out for the church, where the marriage ceremony was to be\nperformed. The clear, bracing air added buoyancy to every movement, and\nthe sun poured its brilliant rays through the deeply-stained windows,\nas the happy couple entered the sanctuary, followed by old Mr. Devenant,\nwhose form, bowed down with age, attracted almost as much attention from\nthe assembly as did the couple more particularly interested.\n\nAs the ceremonies were finished and the priest pronounced the\nbenediction on the newly-married pair, Clotelle whispered in the ear of\nJerome,--\n\n     “'No power in death shall tear our names apart,\n       As none in life could rend thee from my heart.'”\n\nA smile beamed on every face as the wedding-party left the church and\nentered their carriage. What a happy day, after ten years' separation,\nwhen, both hearts having been blighted for a time, they are brought\ntogether by the hand of a beneficent and kind Providence, and united in\nholy wedlock.\n\nEverything being arranged for a wedding tour extending up the Rhine, the\nparty set out the same day for Antwerp. There are many rivers of greater\nlength and width than the Rhine. Our Mississippi would swallow up half\na dozen Rhines. The Hudson is grander, the Tiber, the Po, and the\nMincio more classic; the Thames and Seine bear upon their waters greater\namounts of wealth and commerce; the Nile and the Euphrates have a\ngreater antiquity; but for a combination of interesting historical\nincidents and natural scenery, the Rhine surpasses them all. Nature has\nso ordained it that those who travel in the valley of the Rhine shall\nsee the river, for there never will be a railroad upon its banks. So\nmountainous is the land that it would have to be one series of tunnels.\nEvery three or four miles from the time you enter this glorious river,\nhills, dales, castles, and crags present themselves as the steamer\nglides onward.\n\nTheir first resting-place for any length of time was at Coblentz, at the\nmouth of the “Blue Moselle,” the most interesting place on the river.\nFrom Coblentz they went to Brussels, where they had the greatest\nattention paid them. Besides being provided with letters of\nintroduction, Jerome's complexion secured for him more deference than is\nusually awarded to travellers.\n\nHaving letters of introduction to M. Deceptiax, the great lace\nmanufacturer, that gentleman received them with distinguished honors,\nand gave them a splendid [soiree,] at which the [elite] of the city were\nassembled. The sumptuously-furnished mansion was lavishly decorated for\nthe occasion, and every preparation made that could add to the novelty\nor interest of the event.\n\nJerome, with his beautiful bride, next visited Cologne, the largest and\nwealthiest city on the banks of the Rhine. The Cathedral of Cologne\nis the most splendid structure of the kind in Europe, and Jerome and\nClotelle viewed with interest the beautiful arches and columns of this\nstupendous building, which strikes with awe the beholder, as he gazes at\nits unequalled splendor, surrounded, as it is, by villas, cottages,\nand palace-like mansions, with the enchanting Rhine winding through the\nvine-covered hills.\n\nAfter strolling over miles and miles of classic ground, and visiting\ncastles, whose legends and traditions have given them an enduring fame,\nour delighted travellers started for Geneva, bidding the picturesque\nbanks of the Rhine a regretful farewell. Being much interested in\nliterature, and aware that Geneva was noted for having been the city\nof refuge to the victims of religious and political persecution, Jerome\narranged to stay here for some days. He was provided with a letter\nof introduction to M. de Stee, who had been a fellow-soldier of Mr.\nDevenant in the East India wars, and they were invited to make his house\ntheir home during their sojourn. On the side of a noble mountain, whose\nbase is kissed by the waves of Lake Geneva, and whose slopes are decked\nwith verdure to the utmost peak of its rocky crown, is situated the\ndelightful country-residence of this wealthy, retired French officer. A\nwinding road, with frequent climbs and brakes, leads from the valley to\nthis enchanting spot, the air and scenery of which cannot be surpassed\nin the world.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV. CLOTELLE MEETS HER FATHER.\n\n\nTHE clouds that had skirted the sky during the day broke at last, and\nthe rain fell in torrents, as Jerome and Clotelle retired for the night,\nin the little town of Ferney, on the borders of Lake Leman. The peals\nof thunder, and flashes of vivid lightening, which seemed to leap from\nmountain to mountain and from crag to crag, reverberating among the\nsurrounding hills, foretold a heavy storm.\n\n“I would we were back at Geneva,” said Clotelle, as she heard groans\nissuing from an adjoining room. The sounds, at first faint, grew louder\nand louder, plainly indicating that some person was suffering extreme\npain.\n\n“I did not like this hotel, much, when we came in,” said Jerome,\nrelighting the lamp, which had been accidentally extinguished.\n\n“Nor I,” returned Clotelle.\n\nThe shrieks increased, and an occasional “she's dead!” “I killed her!”\n “No, she is not dead!” and such-like expressions, would be heard from\nthe person, who seemed to be deranged.\n\nThe thunder grew louder, and the flashes of lightening more vivid, while\nthe noise from the sick-room seemed to increase.\n\nAs Jerome opened the door, to learn, if possible, the cause of the cries\nand groans, he could distinguish the words, “She's dead! yes, she's\ndead! but I did not kill her. She was my child! my own daughter. I loved\nher, and yet I did not protect her.”\n\n“Whoever he is,” said Jerome, “he's crack-brained; some robber,\nprobably, from the mountains.”\n\nThe storm continued to rage, and the loud peals of thunder and sharp\nflashes of lightening, together with the shrieks and moans of the maniac\nin the adjoining room, made the night a fearful one. The long hours wore\nslowly away, but neither Jerome nor his wife could sleep, and they arose\nat an early hour in the morning, ordered breakfast, and resolved to\nreturn to Geneva.\n\n“I am sorry, sir, that you were so much disturbed by the sick man last\nnight,” said the landlord, as he handed Jerome his bill. “I should be\nglad if he would get able to go away, or die, for he's a deal of trouble\nto me. Several persons have left my house on his account.”\n\n“Where is he from?” inquired Jerome. “He's from the United States, and\nhas been here a week to-day, and has been crazy ever since.”\n\n“Has he no friends with him?” asked the guest.\n\n“No, he is alone,” was the reply.\n\nJerome related to his wife what he had learned from the landlord,\nrespecting the sick man, and the intelligence impressed her so strongly,\nthat she requested him to make further inquiries concerning the\nstranger.\n\nHe therefore consulted the book in which guests usually register their\nnames, and, to his great surprise, found that the American's name was\nHenry Linwood, and that he was from Richmond, Va.\n\nIt was with feelings of trepidation that Clotelle heard these\nparticulars from the lips of her husband.\n\n“We must see this poor man, whoever he is,” said she, as Jerome finished\nthe sentence.\n\nThe landlord was glad to hear that his guests felt some interest in the\nsick man, and promised that the invalid's room should be got ready for\ntheir reception.\n\nThe clock in the hall was just striking ten, as Jerome passed through\nand entered the sick man's chamber. Stretched upon a mattress, with both\nhands tightly bound to the bedstead, the friendless stranger was indeed\na pitiful sight. His dark, dishevelled hair prematurely gray, his long,\nunshaven beard, and the wildness of the eyes which glanced upon them\nas they opened the door and entered, caused the faint hope which had so\nsuddenly risen in Clotelle's heart, to sink, and she felt that this man\ncould claim no kindred with her. Certainly, he bore no resemblance to\nthe man whom she had called her father, and who had fondly dandled her\non his knee in those happy days of childhood.\n\n“Help!” cried the poor man, as Jerome and his wife walked into the room.\nHis eyes glared, and shriek after shriek broke forth from his parched\nand fevered lips.\n\n“No, I did not kill my daughter!--I did not! she is not dead! Yes, she\nis dead! but I did not kill her--poor girl! Look! that is she! No, it\ncannot be! she cannot come here! it cannot be my poor Clotelle.”\n\nAt the sound of her own name, coming from the maniac's lips, Clotelle\ngasped for breath, and her husband saw that she had grown deadly pale.\nIt seemed evident to him that the man was either guilty of some terrible\nact, or imagined himself to be. His eyeballs rolled in their sockets,\nand his features showed that he was undergoing “the tortures of that\ninward hell,” which seemed to set his whole brain on fire. After\nrecovering her self-possession and strength, Clotelle approached the\nbedside, and laid her soft hand upon the stranger's hot and fevered\nbrow.\n\nOne long, loud shriek rang out on the air, and a piercing cry, “It is\nshe!--Yes, it is she! I see, I see! Ah! no, it is not my daughter! She\nwould not come to me if she could!” broke forth from him.\n\n“I am your daughter,” said Clotelle, as she pressed her handkerchief to\nher face, and sobbed aloud.\n\nLike balls of fire, the poor man's eyes rolled and glared upon the\ncompany, while large drops of perspiration ran down his pale and\nemaciated face. Strange as the scene appeared, all present saw that it\nwas indeed a meeting between a father and his long-lost daughter. Jerome\nnow ordered all present to leave the room, except the nurse, and every\neffort was at once made to quiet the sufferer. When calm, a joyous smile\nwould illuminate the sick man's face, and a strange light beam in his\neyes, as he seemed to realize that she who stood before him was indeed\nhis child.\n\nFor two long days and nights did Clotelle watch at the bedside of her\nfather before he could speak to her intelligently. Sometimes, in his\ninsane fits, he would rave in the most frightful manner, and then, in a\nfew moments, would be as easily governed as a child. At last, however,\nafter a long and apparently refreshing sleep, he awoke suddenly to a\nfull consciousness that it was indeed his daughter who was watching so\npatiently by his side.\n\nThe presence of his long absent child had a soothing effect upon Mr.\nLinwood, and he now recovered rapidly from the sad and almost hopeless\ncondition in which she had found him. When able to converse, without\ndanger of a relapse, he told Clotelle of his fruitless efforts to obtain\na clew to her whereabouts after old Mrs. Miller had sold her to the\nslave-trader. In answer to his daughter's inquiries about his family\naffairs up to the time that he left America, he said,--\n\n“I blamed my wife for your being sold and sent away, for I thought she\nand her mother were acting in collusion; But I afterwards found that\nI had blamed her wrongfully. Poor woman! she knew that I loved your\nmother, and feeling herself forsaken, she grew melancholy and died in a\ndecline three years ago.”\n\nHere both father and daughter wept at the thought of other days. When\nthey had recovered their composure, Mr. Linwood went on again:\n\n“Old Mrs. Miller,” said he, “after the death of Gertrude, aware that\nshe had contributed much toward her unhappiness, took to the free use\nof intoxicating drinks, and became the most brutal creature that ever\nlived. She whipped her slaves without the slightest provocation, and\nseemed to take delight in inventing new tortures with which to punish\nthem. One night last winter, after having flogged one of her slaves\nnearly to death, she returned to her room, and by some means the bedding\ntook fire, and the house was in flames before any one was awakened.\nThere was no one in the building at the time but the old woman and the\nslaves, and although the latter might have saved their mistress, they\nmade no attempt to do so. Thus, after a frightful career of many years,\nthis hard-hearted woman died a most miserable death, unlamented by a\nsingle person.”\n\nClotelle wiped the tears from her eyes, as her father finished this\nstory, for, although Mrs. Miller had been her greatest enemy, she\nregretted to learn that her end had been such a sad one.\n\n“My peace of mind destroyed,” resumed the father, “and broken down in\nhealth, my physician advised me to travel, with the hope of recruiting\nmyself, and I sailed from New York two months ago.”\n\nBeing brought up in America, and having all the prejudice against color\nwhich characterizes his white fellow-countrymen, Mr. Linwood very much\nregretted that his daughter, although herself tinctured with African\nblood, should have married a black man, and he did not fail to express\nto her his dislike of her husband's complexion.\n\n“I married him,” said Clotelle, “because I loved him. Why should the\nwhite man be esteemed as better than the black? I find no difference in\nmen on account of their complexion. One of the cardinal principles of\nChristianity and freedom is the equality and brotherhood of man.”\n\nEvery day Mr. Linwood became more and more familiar with Jerome, and\neventually they were on the most intimate terms.\n\nFifteen days from the time that Clotelle was introduced into her\nfather's room, they left Ferney for Geneva. Many were the excursions\nClotelle made under the shadows of Mont Blanc, and with her husband\nand father for companions; she was now in the enjoyment of pleasures\nhitherto unknown.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV. THE FATHER'S RESOLVE\n\n\nAWARE that her father was still a slave-owner, Clotelle determined to\nuse all her persuasive power to induce him to set them free, and in this\neffort she found a substantial supporter in her husband.\n\n“I have always treated my slaves well,” said Mr. Linwood to Jerome, as\nthe latter expressed his abhorrence of the system; “and my neighbors,\ntoo, are generally good men; for slavery in Virginia is not like slavery\nin the other States,” continued the proud son of the Old Dominion.\n“Their right to be free, Mr. Linwood,” said Jerome, “is taken from\nthem, and they have no security for their comfort, but the humanity and\ngenerosity of men, who have been trained to regard them not as brethren,\nbut as mere property. Humanity and generosity are, at best, but poor\nguaranties for the protection of those who cannot assert their rights,\nand over whom law throws no protection.”\n\nIt was with pleasure that Clotelle obtained from her father a promise\nthat he would liberate all his slaves on his return to Richmond. In a\nbeautiful little villa, situated in a pleasant spot, fringed with hoary\nrocks and thick dark woods, within sight of the deep blue waters of\nLake Leman, Mr. Linwood, his daughter, and her husband, took up their\nresidence for a short time. For more than three weeks, this little party\nspent their time in visiting the birth-place of Rousseau, and the former\nabodes of Byron, Gibbon, Voltaire, De Stael, Shelley, and other literary\ncharacters.\n\nWe can scarcely contemplate a visit to a more historic and interesting\nplace than Geneva and its vicinity. Here, Calvin, that great luminary\nin the Church, lived and ruled for years; here, Voltaire, the mighty\ngenius, who laid the foundation of the French Revolution, and who\nboasted, “When I shake my wig, I powder the whole republic,” governed in\nthe higher walks of life.\n\nFame is generally the recompense, not of the living, but of the\ndead,--not always do they reap and gather in the harvest who sow the\nseed; the flame of its altar is too often kindled from the ashes of the\ngreat. A distinguished critic has beautifully said, “The sound which\nthe stream of high thought, carried down to future ages, makes, as it\nflows--deep, distant, murmuring ever more, like the waters of the mighty\nocean.” No reputation can be called great that will no endure this test.\nThe distinguished men who had lived in Geneva transfused their spirit,\nby their writings, into the spirit of other lovers of literature and\neverything that treated of great authors. Jerome and Clotelle lingered\nlong in and about the haunts of Geneva and Lake Leman.\n\nAn autumn sun sent down her bright rays, and bathed every object in her\nglorious light, as Clotelle, accompanied by her husband and father set\nout one fine morning on her return home to France. Throughout the whole\nroute, Mr. Linwood saw by the deference paid to Jerome, whose black\ncomplexion excited astonishment in those who met him, that there was\nno hatred to the man in Europe, on account of his color; that what is\ncalled prejudice against color is the offspring of the institution of\nslavery; and he felt ashamed of his own countrymen, when he thought of\nthe complexion as distinctions, made in the United States, and resolved\nto dedicate the remainder of his life to the eradication of this\nunrepublican and unchristian feeling from the land of his birth, on his\nreturn home.\n\nAfter a stay of four weeks at Dunkirk, the home of the Fletchers, Mr.\nLinwood set out for America, with the full determination of freeing his\nslaves, and settling them in one of the Northern States, and then to\nreturn to France to end his days in the society of his beloved daughter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI. THE RETURN HOME\n\n\nTHE first gun fired at the American Flag, on the 12th of April, 1861,\nat Fort Sumter, reverberated all over Europe, and was hailed with joy by\nthe crowned heads of the Old World, who hated republican institutions,\nand who thought they saw, in this act of treason, the downfall of the\ngreat American experiment. Most citizens, however, of the United States,\nwho were then sojourning abroad, hastened home to take part in the\nstruggle,--some to side with the rebels, others to take their stand with\nthe friends of liberty. Among the latter, none came with swifter steps\nor more zeal than Jerome and Clotelle Fletcher. They arrived in New\nOrleans a week after the capture of that city by the expedition under\nthe command of Major-Gen. B. F. Butler. But how changed was society\nsince Clotelle had last set feet in the Crescent City! Twenty-two\nyears had passed; her own chequered life had been through many shifting\nscenes; her old acquaintances in New Orleans had all disappeared; and\nwith the exception of the black faces which she beheld at every turn,\nand which in her younger days were her associates, she felt herself in\nthe midst of strangers; and these were arrayed against each other in\nmortal combat. Possessed with ample means, Mr. and Mrs. Fletcher set\nabout the work of assisting those whom the rebellion had placed in a\nstate of starvation and sickness.\n\nWith a heart overflowing with the milk of human kindness, and a tear for\nevery sufferer, no matter of what color or sect, Clotelle was soon known\nas the “Angel of Mercy.”\n\nThe “General Order No. 63,” issued on the 22nd of August, 1862, by\nGen. Butler, recognizing, and calling into the service of the Federal\nGovernment, the battalion of colored men known as the “Native Guard,” at\nonce gave full scope to Jerome's military enthusiasm; and he made haste\nto enlist in the organization.\n\nThe “Native Guard” did good service in New Orleans and vicinity, till\nordered to take part in the siege of Port Hudson, where they appeared\nunder the name of the “First Louisiana,” and under the immediate command\nof Lieut.-Col. Bassett. The heroic attack of this regiment, made on the\n27th of May, 1863, its unsurpassed “charge,” its great loss, and its\nsevere endurance on the field of battle, are incidents which have passed\ninto history. The noble daring of the First Louisiana gained for\nthe black soldiers in our army the praise of all Americans who value\nRepublican institutions.\n\nThere was, however, one scene, the closing one in the first day's attack\non Port Hudson, which, while it reflects undying credit upon the bravery\nof the negro, pays but a sorry tribute to the humanity of the white\ngeneral who brought the scene into existence. The field was strewn with\nthe dead, the dying, and the wounded; and as the jaded regiments were\nleaving the ground, after their unsuccessful attack, it was found that\nCapt. Payne, of the Third Louisiana, had been killed; and his body,\nwhich was easily distinguished by the uniform, was still on the\nbattle-field. The colonel of the regiment, pointing to where the body\nlay, asked, “Are there four men here who will fetch the body of Capt.\nPayne from the field?” Four men stepped out, and at once started. But,\nas the body lay directly under the range of the rebel batteries, they\nwere all swept down by the grape, canister, and shell which were let\nloose by the enemy. The question was again repeated, “Are there four men\nwho will go for the body?” The required number came forth, and started\nupon a run; but, ere they could reach the spot, they were cut down.\n“Are there four more who will try?” The third call was answered in the\naffirmative, and the men started upon the double-quick. They, however,\nfell before getting as far as the preceding four. Twelve men had been\nkilled in the effort to obtain the body of the brave Payne, but to no\npurpose. Humanity forbade another trial, and yet it was made. “Are there\nfour more men in the regiment who will volunteer to go for Capt. Payne's\nbody?” shouted the officer. Four men sprang forward, as if fearful that\nthey would miss the opportunity of these last: one was Jerome Fletcher,\nthe hero of our story. They started upon the run; and, strange to tell,\nall of them reached the body, and had nearly borne it from the field,\nwhen two of the number were cut down. Of these, one was Jerome. His\nhead was entirely torn off by a shell. The body of the deceased officer\nhaving been rescued, an end was put t the human sacrifice.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII. THE ANGEL OF MERCY\n\n\nThe sad intelligence of Jerome's death was brought to Clotelle while she\nwas giving her personal attention to the sick and wounded that filled\nthe hospitals of New Orleans. For a time she withdrew from the gaze of\nmankind, and gave herself up to grief. Few unions had been productive of\nmore harmonious feelings than hers. And this blow, so unexpected and at\na time when she was experiencing such a degree of excitement caused by\nthe rebellion, made her, indeed, feel the affliction severely.\n\nBut the newspaper accounts of the intense suffering of the Union\nprisoners in the rebel States aroused her, and caused her to leave her\nretirement. In the month of October, 1863, Clotelle resolved to visit\nAndersonville, Ga., for the purpose of alleviating the hardships of our\nsick and imprisoned soldiers, and at once put her resolution into effect\nby going immediately to that place. After crossing the lines, she passed\nas a rebel lady, to enable her the more successfully to carry out her\nobject. On her arrival at Andersonville, Clotelle took up her abode\nwith a private family, of Union proclivities, and commenced her work\nof mercy. She first visited the hospitals, the buildings of which were\nmerest excuses for hospitals.\n\nIt was the beginning of November; and, even in that southern latitude,\nthe cold made these miserable abodes uncomfortable nights and mornings.\nThe dirty, unventilated rooms, with nothing but straw upon the cold,\ndamp floor, for beds, upon which lay the ragged, emaciated Union\nprisoners, worn down to skin and bone with disease and starvation,\nwith their sunken eyes and wild looks, made them appear hideous in the\nextreme. The repulsive scenes, that showed the suffering, neglect, and\ncruelty which these poor creatures had experienced, made her heart sink\nwithin her.\n\nHaving paid considerable attention to hospital life in Europe, and so\nrecently from amongst the sick at New Orleans, Clotelle's experience,\nsuggestions, and liberal expenditure of money, would have added greatly\nto the comfort of these helpless men, if the rebel authorities had been\nso disposed. But their hatred to Union prisoners was so apparent, that\nthe interest which this angel of humanity took in the condition of the\nrebel sick could not shield her from the indignation of the secession\nofficials for her good feeling for the Union men. However, with a\ndetermination to do all in her power for the needy, she labored in\nseason and out.\n\nThe brutal treatment and daily murders committed upon our soldiers in\nthe Andersonville prisons caused Clotelle to secretly aid prisoners\nin their escape. In the latter work, she brought to her assistance the\nservices of a negro man named Pete. This individual was employed about\nthe prison, and, having the entire confidence of the commandant, was in\na position to do much good without being suspected. Pete was an\noriginal character, of a jovial nature, and, when intending some serious\nadventure, would appear very solemn, and usually singing a doleful\nditty, often the following, which was a favorite with him:--\n\n      “Come listen, all you darkies, come listen to my song:\n       It am about old Massa, who use me bery wrong.\n       In de cole, frosty mornin', it an't so bery nice,\n       Wid de water to de middle, to hoe among de rice;\n\n          When I neber hab forgotten\n          How I used to hoe de cotton,\n          How I used to hoe de cotton,\n               On de old Virginny shore;\n          But I'll neber hoe de cotton,\n          Oh! neber hoe de cotton\n               Any more.\n\n     “If I feel de drefful hunger, he tink it am a vice,\n       And he gib me for my dinner a little broken rice,--\n       A little broken rice and a bery little fat,\n       And he grumble like de debbil if I eat too much of dat;\n\n          When I neber hab forgotten, etc.\n\n     “He tore me from my Dinah; I tought my heart would burst:\n       He made me lub anoder when my lub was wid de first;\n       He sole my picanninnies becase he got dar price,\n       And shut me in de marsh-field to hoe among de rice;\n\n          When I neber hab forgotten, etc.\n\n     “And all de day I hoe dar, in all de heat and rain;\n       And, as I hoe away dar, my heart go back again,--\n       Back to de little cabin dat stood among de corn,\n       And to de ole plantation where she and I war born!\n\n          Oh! I wish I had forgotten, etc.\n\n     “Den Dinah am beside me, de chil'ren on my knee,\n       And dough I am a slave dar, it 'pears to me I'm free,\n       Till I wake up from my dreaming, and wife and chil'ren gone,\n       I hoe away and weep dar, and weep dar all alone!\n\n          Oh! I wish I had forgotten, etc.\n\n     “But soon a day am comin', a day I long to see,\n       When dis darky in de cole ground, foreber will be free,\n       When wife and chil'ren wid me, I'll sing in Paradise,\n       How He, de blessed Jesus, hab bought me wid a price;\n\n          How de Lord hab not forgotten\n          How well I hoed de cotton,\n          How well I hoed de cotton\n               On de old Virginny shore;\n          Dar I'll neber hoe de cotton,\n          Oh! I'll neber hoe de cotton\n               Any more.”\n\nWhen away from the whites, and among his own class, Pete could often be\nheard in the following strains:--\n\n     “A storm am brewin' in de Souf,\n       A storm am brewin' now.\n     Oh! hearken den, and shut your mouf,\n       And I will tell you how:\n     And I will tell you how, ole boy,\n       De storm of fire will pour,\n     And make de darkies dance for joy,\n       As dey neber danced afore;\n     So shut your mouf as close as deafh,\n     And all you niggas hole your breafh,\n       And I will tell you how.\n\n     “De darkies at de Norf am ris,\n       And dey am comin' down--\n     Am comin' down, I know dey is,\n       To do de white folks brown!\n     Dey'll turn ole Massa out to grass,\n       And set de niggas free,\n     And when dat day am come to pass\n       We'll all be dar to see!\n     So shut your mouf as close as deafh,\n     And all you niggas hole your breafh,\n       And do de white folks brown!\n\n     “Den all de week will be as gay\n       As am de Chris'mas time;\n     We'll dance all night and all de day,\n       And make de banjo chime--\n     And make de banjo chime, I tink,\n       And pass de time away,\n     Wid 'nuf to eat and nuf to drink,\n       And not a bit to pay!\n     So shut your mouf as close as deafh,\n     And all you niggas hole your breafh,\n       And make de banjo chime.”\n\nHow to escape from prison was ever the thoughts by day and dreams\nby night of the incarcerated. Plans were concocted, partly put into\nexecution, and then proved failures. Some of these caused increased\nsuffering to the prisoners after their discovery; for, where the real\nparties could not be found, the whole were ill-treated as a punishment\nto the guilty. Tunnelling was generally the mode for escape; and\ntunnelling became the order of the day, or, rather, the work for the\nnight. In the latter part of November, 1863, the unusual gaiety of the\nprisoners showed that some plan of exit from the prison was soon to be\nexhibited.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII. THE GREAT TUNNEL AND THE MISTAKE\n\n\nFOR several weeks, some ten or fifteen of the most able-bodied of the\nprisoners had been nightly at work; and the great tunnel, the [largest]\never projected by men for their escape from prison, was thought to be\nfinished, with the exception of the tapping outside of the prison wall.\nThe digging of a tunnel is not an easy job, and, consequently, is of\nslow progress. The Andersonville prisoners had to dig ten feet down into\nthe earth, after cutting through the floor, and then went a distance of\nfifty feet to get beyond the wall. The digging was done in the following\nway: As soon as the operator was below the surface, and had a place\nlarge enough to admit the body, he laid down upon his face, at full\nlength, and with his knife, spoon, piece of earthenware, or old iron,\ndug away with all his energies, throwing the dirt behind him, which\nwas gathered up by a confederate, carried off, and hi. This mode of\noperating was carried on night after night, and the flooring replaced\nduring the day, to prevent suspicion. The want of fresh air in the\ntunnel, as it progressed to completion, often drove the men from their\nwork, and caused a delay, which proved fatal to their successful escape.\n\nThe long-looked for day arrived. More than three hundred had prepared\nto leave this hated abode, by the tunnel. All they waited for was the\ntapping and the signal. The time came, the place of egress was tapped,\nand the leader had scarcely put his head out of the hole, ere he was\nfired upon by the sentinels, which soon alarmed and drew the entire\nguard to the spot. Great was the commotion throughout the prison, and\nall who were caught in the tunnel were severely punished.\n\nThis failure seemed to depress the spirits of the men more than any\nprevious attempt. Heavy irons were placed upon the limbs of many of\nthe prisoners, and their lot was made otherwise harder by the keepers.\nClotelle, though often permitted to see the prisoners and contribute to\ntheir wants, and, though knowing much of their designs, knew nothing of\nthe intended escape, and therefore was more bold in her intercessions in\ntheir behalf when failure came upon them.\n\nThe cruelty which followed this mishap, induced Clotelle to interest\nherself in another mode of escape for the men thus so heavily ironed.\n\nPete, the man of all work, whose sympathies were with the Union\nprisoners, was easily gained over to a promise of securing the keys of\nthe prison and letting the men escape, especially when Clotelle offered\nhim money to enable him to make good his own way to the North.\n\nThe night of the exodus came. It was favored with darkness; and it so\nhappened that the officials were on a spree, owing to the arrival of\nConfederate officers with news of a rebel victory.\n\nBefore getting the keys, Pete supplied the sentinels on duty with enough\nwhiskey, which he had stolen from the keepers' store-room, to make them\nall drunk. At the chosen moment, the keys were obtained by Pete, the\ndoors and gates were opened, and ninety-three prisoners, including the\ntunnel workers, whose irons were taken off, made their escape, allowing\nthe faithful negro to accompany them. Nothing was known of the exit of\nthe men till breakfast hour on the next morning. On examination of the\nstore-room, it was found, that, in addition to the whiskey Pete had\ntaken a large supply of stores for the accommodation of the party. Added\nto this, a good number of arms with ammunition had been furnished the\nmen by the African.\n\nThe rebels were not prepared to successfully pursue the fleeing\nprisoners, although armed men were sent in different directions.\nNothing, however, was heard of them till they reached the Union lines.\nLong suspected of too freely aiding Union prisoners, Clotelle was now\nopenly charged with a knowledge of the escape of these men, and was\ncompelled to leave Andersonville.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX. CONCLUSION\n\n\nTHE fiendish and heartless conduct of a large number of the people\nof the South towards Union men during the war, and especially the\nunlady-like demeanor of rebel women at New Orleans and other points, is\na matter that has passed into history. In few places were the women more\nabusive to those of Union proclivities than the female portion of the\ninhabitants of Greenville, Alabama. While passing through this town, on\nher return from Andersonville to New Orleans, Clotelle had to encounter\nthe fierce ill-treatment of these chivalrous daughters of the South.\nThere were, during the rebellion, many brave and generous women, who, in\nthe mountains and lowlands of Alabama, gave aid to Federals,--soldiers\nand civilians,--in their wanderings and escape from the cruelties of the\ntraitors. One of these patriotic women was arrested while on a visit to\nGreenville for the purpose of procuring medicine and other necessaries\nfor sick Union men then hid away in the woods. This large-hearted\nwoman--Eunice Hastings--had her horse taken from her, robbed of the\ngoods she had purchased, and, after experiencing almost death at the\nhands of the rebel women, was released and turned out penniless, and\nwithout the means of reaching her home in the country; when Clotelle,\nwho had just arrived at the dilapidated and poorly kept hotel, met her,\nand, learning the particulars of her case, offered assistance to the\ninjured woman, which brought down upon her own head the condemnation of\nthe secesh population of the place. However, Clotelle purchased a fine\nhorse from the landlord, gave it to Miss Hastings, who, after securing\nsome articles for which she had come to Greenville, left town under\ncover of night, and escaped further molestation. This act of kindness to\na helpless sister at once stirred up the vilest feelings of the people.\n\n“The worst of slaves is he whom passion rules.”\n\nAs has already been said, there was nothing in the appearance of\nClotelle to indicate that a drop of African blood coursed through her\nveins, except, perhaps, the slight wave in the hair, and the scarcely\nperceptible brunettish tinge upon the countenance. She passed as a rebel\nlady; yet the inhabitants of Greenville could not permit sympathy with,\nand aid to, a Union woman to pass unnoticed, and therefore resolved on\nrevenge.\n\n“Revenge, at first though sweet, Bitter ere long, back on itself\nrecoils.”\n\nClotelle's person, trunks, and letters were all searched with the hope\nand expectation of finding evidences of a spy. Nothing of the kind being\nfound, she was then rigorously interrogated as to her sympathies\nwith the two contending armies. With no wish whatever to conceal her\nopinions, she openly avowed that she was a Union woman. This was enough.\nAfter being persecuted during the day, she was put in charge of a\ncommittee of rebel women for the night, with a promise of more violent\ntreatment on the morrow. The loyalty of the negroes of the South, during\nthe severest hours of the rebellion, reflects the greatest possible\ncredit on the race. Through their assistance, hundreds of Union men\nwere enabled to make their escape from prisons, and thousands kept from\nstarvation when on their way to the Federal lines, or while keeping out\nof the way of rebel recruiting gangs. They seldom, if ever, hesitated to\ndo the white Unionists a service, at the risk even of life, and, under\nthe most trying circumstances, revealed a devotion and a spirit of\nself-sacrifice that were heroic. No one ever made an appeal to them they\ndid not answer. They were degraded and ignorant, which was attributable\nto the cruel laws and equally unchristian practices of the people of the\nSouth; but their hearts were always open, and the slightest demand upon\ntheir sympathies brought forth their tears. They never shunned a man or\nwoman who sought food or shelter on their way to freedom. The goodness\nof heart and the guileless spirit of the blacks was not better\nunderstood by any one than Clotelle; and she felt a secret joy at seeing\nall the servants in the Greenville hotel negroes. She saw from their\nvery looks that she had their undivided sympathies. One of the servants\noverheard the rebels in a conversation, in which it was determined to\nsend Clotelle to the county town, for safe keeping in the jail, the\nfollowing day; and this fact was communicated to the unfortunate woman.\nThe slave woman who gave the information told her that she could escape\nif she desired.\n\nHaving already been robbed of every thing except the apparel upon her\nperson and some money she had concealed about her, she at once signified\nto the black woman her wish to get out of the reach of her persecutors.\nThe old worn-out clock in the narrow dining hall had struck one; a\ncold rain was patting upon the roof, and the women watchers, one after\nanother, had fallen asleep; and even the snuff-dippers, whose dirty\npractice creates a nervousness that keeps them awake longer than any\nother class, had yielded to the demands of Morpheus, when Aggy, the\ncolored servant, stealthily entered the room, beckoned to Clotelle, and\nboth left in silence.\n\nCautiously and softly the black woman led the way, followed by the\n“Angel of Mercy,” till, after passing down through the cellar with the\nwater covering the floor, they emerged into the back yard. Two horses\nhad been provided. Clotelle mounted one, and a black man the other;\nthe latter leading the way. Both dashed off at a rapid pace, through a\ndrenching storm, with such a pall-like darkness that they could not see\neach other. After an hour's ride the negro halted, and informed Clotelle\nthat he must leave her, and return with the horses, but that she was\nwith friends. He then gave a whistle, and for a moment held his breath.\nJust as the faithful black was about to repeat the signal, he heard the\nresponse; and in a moment the lady alighted, and with dripping garments,\nlimbs chilled to numbness, followed her new guide to a place of\nconcealment, near the village of Taitsville.\n\n“You is jes as wet as a drownded rat,” said the mulatto woman, who met\nClotelle as she entered the negro's cabin.\n\n“Yes,” replied the latter, “this is a stormy night for one to be out.”\n\n“Yes mam, dese is hard times for eberybody dat 'bleves in de Union. I\n'spose deys cotched your husband, an' put him in de army, ain't dey?”\n\n“No: my husband died at Port Hudson, fighting for the Union,” said\nClotelle.\n\n“Oh, mam, dats de place whar de black people fight de rebels so, wasn't\nit?” remarked Dinah, for such was her name.\n\n“Yes, that was the place,” replied the former. “I see that your husband\nhas lost one of his hands: did he lose it in the war?”\n\n“Oh no, missus,” said Dinah. “When dey was taken all de men, black an\nwhite, to put in de army, dey cotched my ole man too, and took him long\nwid 'em. So you see, he said he'd die afore he'd shoot at de Yanks. So\nyou see, missus, Jimmy jes took and lay his left han' on a log, and chop\nit off wid de hatchet. Den, you see, dey let him go, an' he come home.\nYou see, missus, my Jimmy is a free man: he was born free, an' he bought\nme, an' pay fifteen hundred dollars for me.”\n\nIt was true that Jim had purchased his wife; nor had he forgotten the\nfact, as was shown a day or two after, while in conversation with her.\nThe woman, like many of her sex, was an inveterate scold, and Jim had\nbut one way to govern her tongue. “Shet your mouf, madam, an' hole your\ntongue,” said Jim, after his wife had scolded and sputtered away for\nsome minutes. “Shet your mouf dis minit, I say: you shan't stan' dar,\nan' talk ter me in dat way. I bought you, an' paid my money fer you,\nan' I ain't a gwine ter let you sase me in dat way. Shet your mouf dis\nminit: ef you don't I'll sell you; 'fore God I will. Shet up, I say, or\nI'll sell you.” This had the desired effect, and settled Dinah for the\nday.\n\nAfter a week spent in this place of concealment, Jim conveyed Clotelle\nto Leaksville, Mississippi, through the Federal lines, and from thence\nshe proceeded to New Orleans.\n\nThe Rebellion was now drawing to a close. The valley of the Mississippi\nwas in full possession of the Federal government. Sherman was on his\nraid, and Grant was hemming in Lee. Everywhere the condition of the\nfreedmen attracted the attention of the friends of humanity, and no one\nfelt more keenly their wants than Clotelle; and to their education and\nwelfare she resolved to devote the remainder of her life, and for this\npurpose went to the State of Mississippi, and opened a school for the\nfreedmen; hired teachers, paying them out of her own purse. In the\nsummer of 1866, the Poplar Farm, on which she had once lived as a slave,\nwas confiscated and sold by Government authority, and was purchased by\nClotelle, upon which she established a Freedmen's School, and where at\nthis writing,--now June, 1867,--resides the “Angel of Mercy.”"
