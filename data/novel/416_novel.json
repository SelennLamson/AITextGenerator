Gripped by these\nstories and sketches of Sherwood Anderson's small-town\n\"grotesques,\" I felt that he was opening for me new depths\nof experience, touching upon half-buried truths which\nnothing in my young life had prepared me for. A New York\nCity boy who never saw the crops grow or spent time in the\nsmall towns that lay sprinkled across America, I found\nmyself overwhelmed by the scenes of wasted life, wasted\nlove--was this the \"real\" America?--that Anderson sketched\nin Winesburg. In those days only one other book seemed to\noffer so powerful a revelation, and that was Thomas Hardy's\nJude the Obscure.\n\nSeveral years later, as I was about to go overseas as\na soldier, I spent my last week-end pass on a somewhat\nquixotic journey to Clyde, Ohio, the town upon which\nWinesburg was partly modeled. Clyde looked, I suppose, not\nvery different from most other American towns, and the few\nof its residents I tried to engage in talk about Anderson\nseemed quite uninterested. This indifference would not have\nsurprised him; it certainly should not surprise anyone who\nreads his book.\n\nOnce freed from the army, I started to write literary\ncriticism, and in 1951 I published a critical biography\nof Anderson. It came shortly after Lionel Trilling's\ninfluential essay attacking Anderson, an attack from\nwhich Anderson's reputation would never quite recover.\nTrilling charged Anderson with indulging a vaporous\nsentimentalism, a kind of vague emotional meandering in\nstories that lacked social or spiritual solidity. There\nwas a certain cogency in Trilling's attack, at least\nwith regard to Anderson's inferior work, most of which\nhe wrote after Winesburg, Ohio. In my book I tried,\nsomewhat awkwardly, to bring together the kinds of\njudgment Trilling had made with my still keen affection\nfor the best of Anderson's writings. By then, I had\nread writers more complex, perhaps more distinguished\nthan Anderson, but his muted stories kept a firm place\nin my memories, and the book I wrote might be seen as a\ngesture of thanks for the light--a glow of darkness,\nyou might say--that he had brought to me.\n\nDecades passed.  I no longer read Anderson, perhaps\nfearing I might have to surrender an admiration of\nyouth. (There are some writers one should never return\nto.) But now, in the fullness of age, when asked to say\na few introductory words about Anderson and his work, I\nhave again fallen under the spell of Winesburg, Ohio,\nagain responded to the half-spoken desires, the\nflickers of longing that spot its pages. Naturally, I\nnow have some changes of response: a few of the stories\nno longer haunt me as once they did, but the long story\n\"Godliness,\" which years ago I considered a failure, I\nnow see as a quaintly effective account of the way\nreligious fanaticism and material acquisitiveness can\nbecome intertwined in American experience.\n\n            *       *       *\n\nSherwood Anderson was born in Ohio in 1876. His\nchildhood and youth in Clyde, a town with perhaps three\nthousand souls, were scarred by bouts of poverty, but\nhe also knew some of the pleasures of pre-industrial\nAmerican society. The country was then experiencing\nwhat he would later call \"a sudden and almost universal\nturning of men from the old handicrafts towards our\nmodern life of machines.\" There were still people in\nClyde who remembered the frontier, and like America\nitself, the town lived by a mixture of diluted\nCalvinism and a strong belief in \"progress,\" Young\nSherwood, known as \"Jobby\"--the boy always ready to\nwork--showed the kind of entrepreneurial spirit that\nClyde respected: folks expected him to become a\n\"go-getter,\" And for a time he did. Moving to Chicago\nin his early twenties, he worked in an advertising\nagency where he proved adept at turning out copy. \"I\ncreate nothing, I boost, I boost,\" he said about\nhimself, even as, on the side, he was trying to write\nshort stories.\n\nIn 1904 Anderson married and three years later moved to\nElyria, a town forty miles west of Cleveland, where he\nestablished a firm that sold paint. \"I was going to be\na rich man.... Next year a bigger house; and after\nthat, presumably, a country estate.\" Later he would say\nabout his years in Elyria, \"I was a good deal of a\nBabbitt, but never completely one.\" Something drove him\nto write, perhaps one of those shapeless hungers--a\nneed for self-expression? a wish to find a more\nauthentic kind of experience?--that would become a\nrecurrent motif in his fiction.\n\nAnd then, in 1912, occurred the great turning point in\nAnderson's life. Plainly put, he suffered a nervous\nbreakdown, though in his memoirs he would elevate this\ninto a moment of liberation in which he abandoned the\nsterility of commerce and turned to the rewards of\nliterature. Nor was this, I believe, merely a deception\non Anderson's part, since the breakdown painful as it\nsurely was, did help precipitate a basic change in his\nlife. At the age of 36, he left behind his business and\nmoved to Chicago, becoming one of the rebellious\nwriters and cultural bohemians in the group that has\nsince come to be called the \"Chicago Renaissance.\"\nAnderson soon adopted the posture of a free, liberated\nspirit, and like many writers of the time, he presented\nhimself as a sardonic critic of American provincialism\nand materialism. It was in the freedom of the city, in\nits readiness to put up with deviant styles of life,\nthat Anderson found the strength to settle accounts\nwith--but also to release his affection for--the world\nof small-town America. The dream of an unconditional\npersonal freedom, that hazy American version of utopia,\nwould remain central throughout Anderson's life and\nwork. It was an inspiration; it was a delusion.\n\nIn 1916 and 1917 Anderson published two novels mostly\nwritten in Elyria, Windy McPherson's Son and Marching\nMen, both by now largely forgotten. They show patches\nof talent but also a crudity of thought and\nunsteadiness of language. No one reading these novels\nwas likely to suppose that its author could soon\nproduce anything as remarkable as Winesburg, Ohio.\nOccasionally there occurs in a writer's career a\nsudden, almost mysterious leap of talent, beyond\nexplanation, perhaps beyond any need for explanation.\n\nIn 1915-16 Anderson had begun to write and in 1919 he\npublished the stories that comprise Winesburg, Ohio,\nstories that form, in sum, a sort of loosely-strung\nepisodic novel. The book was an immediate critical\nsuccess, and soon Anderson was being ranked as a\nsignificant literary figure. In 1921 the distinguished\nliterary magazine The Dial awarded him its first annual\nliterary prize of $2,000, the significance of which is\nperhaps best understood if one also knows that the\nsecond recipient was T. S. Eliot. But Anderson's moment\nof glory was brief, no more than a decade, and sadly,\nthe remaining years until his death in 1940 were marked\nby a sharp decline in his literary standing. Somehow,\nexcept for an occasional story like the haunting \"Death\nin the Woods,\" he was unable to repeat or surpass his\nearly success. Still, about Winesburg, Ohio and a small\nnumber of stories like \"The Egg\" and \"The Man Who\nBecame a Woman\" there has rarely been any critical\ndoubt.\n\n            *       *       *\n\nNo sooner did Winesburg, Ohio make its appearance than\na number of critical labels were fixed on it: the\nrevolt against the village, the espousal of sexual\nfreedom, the deepening of American realism. Such tags\nmay once have had their point, but by now they seem\ndated and stale. The revolt against the village (about\nwhich Anderson was always ambivalent) has faded into\nhistory. The espousal of sexual freedom would soon be\nexceeded in boldness by other writers. And as for the\neffort to place Winesburg, Ohio in a tradition of\nAmerican realism, that now seems dubious. Only rarely\nis the object of Anderson's stories social\nverisimilitude, or the \"photographing\" of familiar\nappearances, in the sense, say, that one might use to\ndescribe a novel by Theodore Dreiser or Sinclair Lewis.\nOnly occasionally, and then with a very light touch,\ndoes Anderson try to fill out the social arrangements\nof his imaginary town--although the fact that his\nstories are set in a mid-American place like Winesburg\ndoes constitute an important formative condition. You\nmight even say, with only slight overstatement, that\nwhat Anderson is doing in Winesburg, Ohio could be\ndescribed as \"antirealistic,\" fictions notable less for\nprecise locale and social detail than for a highly\npersonal, even strange vision of American life. Narrow,\nintense, almost claustrophobic, the result is a book\nabout extreme states of being, the collapse of men and\nwomen who have lost their psychic bearings and now\nhover, at best tolerated, at the edge of the little\ncommunity in which they live. It would be a gross\nmistake, though not one likely to occur by now, if we\nwere to take Winesburg, Ohio as a social photograph of\n\"the typical small town\" (whatever that might be.)\nAnderson evokes a depressed landscape in which lost\nsouls wander about; they make their flitting\nappearances mostly in the darkness of night, these\nstumps and shades of humanity. This vision has its\ntruth, and at its best it is a terrible if narrow\ntruth--but it is itself also grotesque, with the tone\nof the authorial voice and the mode of composition\nforming muted signals of the book's content. Figures\nlike Dr. Parcival, Kate Swift, and Wash Williams are\nnot, nor are they meant to be, \"fully-rounded\"\ncharacters such as we can expect in realistic fiction;\nthey are the shards of life, glimpsed for a moment, the\ndebris of suffering and defeat. In each story one of\nthem emerges, shyly or with a false assertiveness,\ntrying to reach out to companionship and love, driven\nalmost mad by the search for human connection. In the\neconomy of Winesburg these grotesques matter less in\ntheir own right than as agents or symptoms of that\n\"indefinable hunger\" for meaning which is Anderson's\npreoccupation.\n\nBrushing against one another, passing one another in\nthe streets or the fields, they see bodies and hear\nvoices, but it does not really matter--they are\ndisconnected, psychically lost. Is this due to the\nparticular circumstances of small-town America as\nAnderson saw it at the turn of the century? Or does he\nfeel that he is sketching an inescapable human\ncondition which makes all of us bear the burden of\nloneliness? Alice Hindman in the story \"Adventure\"\nturns her face to the wall and tries \"to force herself\nto face the fact that many people must live and die\nalone, even in Winesburg.\" Or especially in Winesburg?\nSuch impressions have been put in more general terms in\nAnderson's only successful novel, Poor White:\n\n  All men lead their lives behind a wall of\n  misunderstanding they have themselves built,\n  and most men die in silence and unnoticed\n  behind the walls.  Now and then a man, cut\n  off from his fellows by the peculiarities\n  of his nature, becomes absorbed in doing\n  something that is personal, useful and\n  beautiful.  Word of his activities is\n  carried over the walls.\n\nThese \"walls\" of misunderstanding are only seldom due\nto physical deformities (Wing Biddlebaum in \"Hands\") or\noppressive social arrangements (Kate Swift in \"The\nTeacher.\") Misunderstanding, loneliness, the inability\nto articulate, are all seen by Anderson as virtually a\nroot condition, something deeply set in our natures.\nNor are these people, the grotesques, simply to be\npitied and dismissed; at some point in their lives they\nhave known desire, have dreamt of ambition, have hoped\nfor friendship. In all of them there was once something\nsweet, \"like the twisted little apples that grow in the\norchards in Winesburg.\" Now, broken and adrift, they\nclutch at some rigid notion or idea, a \"truth\" which\nturns out to bear the stamp of monomania, leaving them\nhelplessly sputtering, desperate to speak out but\nunable to. Winesburg, Ohio registers the losses\ninescapable to life, and it does so with a deep\nfraternal sadness, a sympathy casting a mild glow over\nthe entire book. \"Words,\" as the American writer Paula\nFox has said, \"are nets through which all truth\nescapes.\" Yet what do we have but words?\n\nThey want, these Winesburg grotesques, to unpack their\nhearts, to release emotions buried and festering. Wash\nWilliams tries to explain his eccentricity but hardly\ncan; Louise Bentley \"tried to talk but could say\nnothing\"; Enoch Robinson retreats to a fantasy world,\ninventing \"his own people to whom he could really talk\nand to whom he explained the things he had been unable\nto explain to living people.\"\n\nIn his own somber way, Anderson has here touched upon\none of the great themes of American literature,\nespecially Midwestern literature, in the late\nnineteenth and early twentieth centuries: the struggle\nfor speech as it entails a search for the self. Perhaps\nthe central Winesburg story, tracing the basic\nmovements of the book, is \"Paper Pills,\" in which the\nold Doctor Reefy sits \"in his empty office close by a\nwindow that was covered with cobwebs,\" writes down some\nthoughts on slips of paper (\"pyramids of truth,\" he\ncalls them) and then stuffs them into his pockets where\nthey \"become round hard balls\" soon to be discarded.\nWhat Dr. Reefy's \"truths\" may be we never know;\nAnderson simply persuades us that to this lonely old\nman they are utterly precious and thereby\nincommunicable, forming a kind of blurred moral\nsignature.\n\nAfter a time the attentive reader will notice in these\nstories a recurrent pattern of theme and incident: the\ngrotesques, gathering up a little courage, venture out\ninto the streets of Winesburg, often in the dark, there\nto establish some initiatory relationship with George\nWillard, the young reporter who hasn't yet lived long\nenough to become a grotesque. Hesitantly, fearfully, or\nwith a sputtering incoherent rage, they approach him,\npleading that he listen to their stories in the hope\nthat perhaps they can find some sort of renewal in his\nyouthful voice. Upon this sensitive and fragile boy\nthey pour out their desires and frustrations. Dr.\nParcival hopes that George Willard \"will write the book\nI may never get written,\" and for Enoch Robinson, the\nboy represents \"the youthful sadness, young man's\nsadness, the sadness of a growing boy in a village at\nthe year's end [which may open] the lips of the old\nman.\"\n\nWhat the grotesques really need is each other, but\ntheir estrangement is so extreme they cannot establish\ndirect ties--they can only hope for connection through\nGeorge Willard. The burden this places on the boy is\nmore than he can bear. He listens to them attentively,\nhe is sympathetic to their complaints, but finally he\nis too absorbed in his own dreams. The grotesques turn\nto him because he seems \"different\"--younger, more\nopen, not yet hardened--but it is precisely this\n\"difference\" that keeps him from responding as warmly\nas they want. It is hardly the boy's fault; it is\nsimply in the nature of things. For George Willard, the\ngrotesques form a moment in his education; for the\ngrotesques, their encounters with George Willard come\nto seem like a stamp of hopelessness.\n\nThe prose Anderson employs in telling these stories may\nseem at first glance to be simple: short sentences, a\nsparse vocabulary, uncomplicated syntax. In actuality,\nAnderson developed an artful style in which, following\nMark Twain and preceding Ernest Hemingway, he tried to\nuse American speech as the base of a tensed rhythmic\nprose that has an economy and a shapeliness seldom\nfound in ordinary speech or even oral narration. What\nAnderson employs here is a stylized version of the\nAmerican language, sometimes rising to quite formal\nrhetorical patterns and sometimes sinking to a\nself-conscious mannerism. But at its best, Anderson's\nprose style in Winesburg, Ohio is a supple instrument,\nyielding that \"low fine music\" which he admired so much\nin the stories of Turgenev.\n\nOne of the worst fates that can befall a writer is that\nof self-imitation: the effort later in life, often\ndesperate, to recapture the tones and themes of\nyouthful beginnings. Something of the sort happened\nwith Anderson's later writings. Most critics and\nreaders grew impatient with the work he did after, say,\n1927 or 1928; they felt he was constantly repeating his\ngestures of emotional \"groping\"--what he had called in\nWinesburg, Ohio the \"indefinable hunger\" that prods and\ntorments people. It became the critical fashion to see\nAnderson's \"gropings\" as a sign of delayed adolescence,\na failure to develop as a writer. Once he wrote a\nchilling reply to those who dismissed him in this way:\n\"I don't think it matters much, all this calling a man\na muddler, a groper, etc.... The very man who throws\nsuch words as these knows in his heart that he is also\nfacing a wall.\" This remark seems to me both dignified\nand strong, yet it must be admitted that there was some\njustice in the negative responses to his later work.\nFor what characterized it was not so much \"groping\" as\nthe imitation of \"groping,\" the self-caricature of a\nwriter who feels driven back upon an earlier self that\nis, alas, no longer available.\n\nBut Winesburg, Ohio remains a vital work, fresh and\nauthentic. Most of its stories are composed in a minor\nkey, a tone of subdued pathos--pathos marking both the\nnature and limit of Anderson's talent. (He spoke of\nhimself as a \"minor writer.\") In a few stories,\nhowever, he was able to reach beyond pathos and to\nstrike a tragic note. The single best story in\nWinesburg, Ohio is, I think, \"The Untold Lie,\" in which\nthe urgency of choice becomes an outer sign of a tragic\nelement in the human condition. And in Anderson's\nsingle greatest story, \"The Egg,\" which appeared a few\nyears after Winesburg, Ohio, he succeeded in bringing\ntogether a surface of farce with an undertone of\ntragedy. \"The Egg\" is an American masterpiece.\n\nAnderson's influence upon later American writers,\nespecially those who wrote short stories, has been\nenormous. Ernest Hemingway and William Faulkner both\npraised him as a writer who brought a new tremor of\nfeeling, a new sense of introspectiveness to the\nAmerican short story. As Faulkner put it, Anderson's\n\"was the fumbling for exactitude, the exact word and\nphrase within the limited scope of a vocabulary\ncontrolled and even repressed by what was in him almost\na fetish of simplicity ... to seek always to penetrate\nto thought's uttermost end.\" And in many younger\nwriters who may not even be aware of the Anderson\ninfluence, you can see touches of his approach, echoes\nof his voice.\n\nWriting about the Elizabethan playwright John Ford, the\npoet Algernon Swinburne once said: \"If he touches you\nonce he takes you, and what he takes he keeps hold of;\nhis work becomes part of your thought and parcel of\nyour spiritual furniture forever.\" So it is, for me and\nmany others, with Sherwood Anderson.\n\n\n\n\nTo the memory of my mother,\n\nEMMA SMITH ANDERSON,\n\nwhose keen observations on the life about\nher first awoke in me the hunger to see\nbeneath the surface of lives,\nthis book is dedicated.\n\n\n\n\nTHE TALES\nAND THE PERSONS\n\n\n\n\nTHE BOOK OF\nTHE GROTESQUE\n\n\n\n\nThe writer, an old man with a white mustache, had some\ndifficulty in getting into bed. The windows of the\nhouse in which he lived were high and he wanted to look\nat the trees when he awoke in the morning. A carpenter\ncame to fix the bed so that it would be on a level with\nthe window.\n\nQuite a fuss was made about the matter. The carpenter,\nwho had been a soldier in the Civil War, came into the\nwriter's room and sat down to talk of building a\nplatform for the purpose of raising the bed. The writer\nhad cigars lying about and the carpenter smoked.\n\nFor a time the two men talked of the raising of the bed\nand then they talked of other things. The soldier got\non the subject of the war. The writer, in fact, led him\nto that subject. The carpenter had once been a prisoner\nin Andersonville prison and had lost a brother. The\nbrother had died of starvation, and whenever the\ncarpenter got upon that subject he cried. He, like the\nold writer, had a white mustache, and when he cried he\npuckered up his lips and the mustache bobbed up and\ndown. The weeping old man with the cigar in his mouth\nwas ludicrous. The plan the writer had for the raising\nof his bed was forgotten and later the carpenter did it\nin his own way and the writer, who was past sixty, had\nto help himself with a chair when he went to bed at\nnight.\n\nIn his bed the writer rolled over on his side and lay\nquite still. For years he had been beset with notions\nconcerning his heart. He was a hard smoker and his\nheart fluttered. The idea had got into his mind that he\nwould some time die unexpectedly and always when he got\ninto bed he thought of that. It did not alarm him. The\neffect in fact was quite a special thing and not easily\nexplained. It made him more alive, there in bed, than\nat any other time. Perfectly still he lay and his body\nwas old and not of much use any more, but something\ninside him was altogether young. He was like a pregnant\nwoman, only that the thing inside him was not a baby\nbut a youth. No, it wasn't a youth, it was a woman,\nyoung, and wearing a coat of mail like a knight. It is\nabsurd, you see, to try to tell what was inside the old\nwriter as he lay on his high bed and listened to the\nfluttering of his heart. The thing to get at is what\nthe writer, or the young thing within the writer, was\nthinking about.\n\nThe old writer, like all of the people in the world,\nhad got, during his long life, a great many notions in\nhis head. He had once been quite handsome and a number\nof women had been in love with him. And then, of\ncourse, he had known people, many people, known them in\na peculiarly intimate way that was different from the\nway in which you and I know people. At least that is\nwhat the writer thought and the thought pleased him.\nWhy quarrel with an old man concerning his thoughts?\n\nIn the bed the writer had a dream that was not a dream.\nAs he grew somewhat sleepy but was still conscious,\nfigures began to appear before his eyes. He imagined\nthe young indescribable thing within himself was\ndriving a long procession of figures before his eyes.\n\nYou see the interest in all this lies in the figures\nthat went before the eyes of the writer. They were all\ngrotesques. All of the men and women the writer had\never known had become grotesques.\n\nThe grotesques were not all horrible. Some were\namusing, some almost beautiful, and one, a woman all\ndrawn out of shape, hurt the old man by her\ngrotesqueness. When she passed he made a noise like a\nsmall dog whimpering. Had you come into the room you\nmight have supposed the old man had unpleasant dreams\nor perhaps indigestion.\n\nFor an hour the procession of grotesques passed before\nthe eyes of the old man, and then, although it was a\npainful thing to do, he crept out of bed and began to\nwrite. Some one of the grotesques had made a deep\nimpression on his mind and he wanted to describe it.\n\nAt his desk the writer worked for an hour. In the end\nhe wrote a book which he called \"The Book of the\nGrotesque.\" It was never published, but I saw it once\nand it made an indelible impression on my mind. The\nbook had one central thought that is very strange and\nhas always remained with me. By remembering it I have\nbeen able to understand many people and things that I\nwas never able to understand before. The thought was\ninvolved but a simple statement of it would be\nsomething like this:\n\nThat in the beginning when the world was young there\nwere a great many thoughts but no such thing as a\ntruth. Man made the truths himself and each truth was a\ncomposite of a great many vague thoughts. All about in\nthe world were the truths and they were all beautiful.\n\nThe old man had listed hundreds of the truths in his\nbook. I will not try to tell you of all of them. There\nwas the truth of virginity and the truth of passion,\nthe truth of wealth and of poverty, of thrift and of\nprofligacy, of carelessness and abandon. Hundreds and\nhundreds were the truths and they were all beautiful.\n\nAnd then the people came along. Each as he appeared\nsnatched up one of the truths and some who were quite\nstrong snatched up a dozen of them.\n\nIt was the truths that made the people grotesques. The\nold man had quite an elaborate theory concerning the\nmatter. It was his notion that the moment one of the\npeople took one of the truths to himself, called it his\ntruth, and tried to live his life by it, he became a\ngrotesque and the truth he embraced became a falsehood.\n\nYou can see for yourself how the old man, who had spent\nall of his life writing and was filled with words,\nwould write hundreds of pages concerning this matter.\nThe subject would become so big in his mind that he\nhimself would be in danger of becoming a grotesque. He\ndidn't, I suppose, for the same reason that he never\npublished the book. It was the young thing inside him\nthat saved the old man.\n\nConcerning the old carpenter who fixed the bed for the\nwriter, I only mentioned him because he, like many of\nwhat are called very common people, became the nearest\nthing to what is understandable and lovable of all the\ngrotesques in the writer's book.\n\n\n\nHANDS\n\nUpon the half decayed veranda of a small frame house\nthat stood near the edge of a ravine near the town of\nWinesburg, Ohio, a fat little old man walked nervously\nup and down. Across a long field that had been seeded\nfor clover but that had produced only a dense crop of\nyellow mustard weeds, he could see the public highway\nalong which went a wagon filled with berry pickers\nreturning from the fields. The berry pickers, youths\nand maidens, laughed and shouted boisterously. A boy\nclad in a blue shirt leaped from the wagon and\nattempted to drag after him one of the maidens, who\nscreamed and protested shrilly. The feet of the boy in\nthe road kicked up a cloud of dust that floated across\nthe face of the departing sun. Over the long field came\na thin girlish voice. \"Oh, you Wing Biddlebaum, comb\nyour hair, it's falling into your eyes,\" commanded the\nvoice to the man, who was bald and whose nervous little\nhands fiddled about the bare white forehead as though\narranging a mass of tangled locks.\n\nWing Biddlebaum, forever frightened and beset by a\nghostly band of doubts, did not think of himself as in\nany way a part of the life of the town where he had\nlived for twenty years. Among all the people of\nWinesburg but one had come close to him. With George\nWillard, son of Tom Willard, the proprietor of the New\nWillard House, he had formed something like a\nfriendship. George Willard was the reporter on the\nWinesburg Eagle and sometimes in the evenings he walked\nout along the highway to Wing Biddlebaum's house. Now\nas the old man walked up and down on the veranda, his\nhands moving nervously about, he was hoping that George\nWillard would come and spend the evening with him.\nAfter the wagon containing the berry pickers had\npassed, he went across the field through the tall\nmustard weeds and climbing a rail fence peered\nanxiously along the road to the town. For a moment he\nstood thus, rubbing his hands together and looking up\nand down the road, and then, fear overcoming him, ran\nback to walk again upon the porch on his own house.\n\nIn the presence of George Willard, Wing Biddlebaum, who\nfor twenty years had been the town mystery, lost\nsomething of his timidity, and his shadowy personality,\nsubmerged in a sea of doubts, came forth to look at the\nworld. With the young reporter at his side, he ventured\nin the light of day into Main Street or strode up and\ndown on the rickety front porch of his own house,\ntalking excitedly. The voice that had been low and\ntrembling became shrill and loud. The bent figure\nstraightened. With a kind of wriggle, like a fish\nreturned to the brook by the fisherman, Biddlebaum the\nsilent began to talk, striving to put into words the\nideas that had been accumulated by his mind during long\nyears of silence.\n\nWing Biddlebaum talked much with his hands. The slender\nexpressive fingers, forever active, forever striving to\nconceal themselves in his pockets or behind his back,\ncame forth and became the piston rods of his machinery\nof expression.\n\nThe story of Wing Biddlebaum is a story of hands. Their\nrestless activity, like unto the beating of the wings\nof an imprisoned bird, had given him his name. Some\nobscure poet of the town had thought of it. The hands\nalarmed their owner. He wanted to keep them hidden away\nand looked with amazement at the quiet inexpressive\nhands of other men who worked beside him in the fields,\nor passed, driving sleepy teams on country roads.\n\nWhen he talked to George Willard, Wing Biddlebaum\nclosed his fists and beat with them upon a table or on\nthe walls of his house. The action made him more\ncomfortable. If the desire to talk came to him when the\ntwo were walking in the fields, he sought out a stump\nor the top board of a fence and with his hands pounding\nbusily talked with renewed ease.\n\nThe story of Wing Biddlebaum's hands is worth a book in\nitself. Sympathetically set forth it would tap many\nstrange, beautiful qualities in obscure men. It is a\njob for a poet. In Winesburg the hands had attracted\nattention merely because of their activity. With them\nWing Biddlebaum had picked as high as a hundred and\nforty quarts of strawberries in a day. They became his\ndistinguishing feature, the source of his fame. Also\nthey made more grotesque an already grotesque and\nelusive individuality. Winesburg was proud of the hands\nof Wing Biddlebaum in the same spirit in which it was\nproud of Banker White's new stone house and Wesley\nMoyer's bay stallion, Tony Tip, that had won the\ntwo-fifteen trot at the fall races in Cleveland.\n\nAs for George Willard, he had many times wanted to ask\nabout the hands. At times an almost overwhelming\ncuriosity had taken hold of him. He felt that there\nmust be a reason for their strange activity and their\ninclination to keep hidden away and only a growing\nrespect for Wing Biddlebaum kept him from blurting out\nthe questions that were often in his mind.\n\nOnce he had been on the point of asking. The two were\nwalking in the fields on a summer afternoon and had\nstopped to sit upon a grassy bank. All afternoon Wing\nBiddlebaum had talked as one inspired. By a fence he\nhad stopped and beating like a giant woodpecker upon\nthe top board had shouted at George Willard, condemning\nhis tendency to be too much influenced by the people\nabout him, \"You are destroying yourself,\" he cried.\n\"You have the inclination to be alone and to dream and\nyou are afraid of dreams. You want to be like others in\ntown here. You hear them talk and you try to imitate\nthem.\"\n\nOn the grassy bank Wing Biddlebaum had tried again to\ndrive his point home. His voice became soft and\nreminiscent, and with a sigh of contentment he launched\ninto a long rambling talk, speaking as one lost in a\ndream.\n\nOut of the dream Wing Biddlebaum made a picture for\nGeorge Willard. In the picture men lived again in a\nkind of pastoral golden age. Across a green open\ncountry came clean-limbed young men, some afoot, some\nmounted upon horses. In crowds the young men came to\ngather about the feet of an old man who sat beneath a\ntree in a tiny garden and who talked to them.\n\nWing Biddlebaum became wholly inspired. For once he\nforgot the hands. Slowly they stole forth and lay upon\nGeorge Willard's shoulders. Something new and bold came\ninto the voice that talked. \"You must try to forget all\nyou have learned,\" said the old man. \"You must begin to\ndream. From this time on you must shut your ears to the\nroaring of the voices.\"\n\nPausing in his speech, Wing Biddlebaum looked long and\nearnestly at George Willard. His eyes glowed. Again he\nraised the hands to caress the boy and then a look of\nhorror swept over his face.\n\nWith a convulsive movement of his body, Wing Biddlebaum\nsprang to his feet and thrust his hands deep into his\ntrousers pockets. Tears came to his eyes. \"I must be\ngetting along home. I can talk no more with you,\" he\nsaid nervously.\n\nWithout looking back, the old man had hurried down the\nhillside and across a meadow, leaving George Willard\nperplexed and frightened upon the grassy slope. With a\nshiver of dread the boy arose and went along the road\ntoward town. \"I'll not ask him about his hands,\" he\nthought, touched by the memory of the terror he had\nseen in the man's eyes. \"There's something wrong, but I\ndon't want to know what it is. His hands have something\nto do with his fear of me and of everyone.\"\n\nAnd George Willard was right. Let us look briefly into\nthe story of the hands. Perhaps our talking of them\nwill arouse the poet who will tell the hidden wonder\nstory of the influence for which the hands were but\nfluttering pennants of promise.\n\nIn his youth Wing Biddlebaum had been a school teacher\nin a town in Pennsylvania. He was not then known as\nWing Biddlebaum, but went by the less euphonic name of\nAdolph Myers. As Adolph Myers he was much loved by the\nboys of his school.\n\nAdolph Myers was meant by nature to be a teacher of\nyouth. He was one of those rare, little-understood men\nwho rule by a power so gentle that it passes as a\nlovable weakness. In their feeling for the boys under\ntheir charge such men are not unlike the finer sort of\nwomen in their love of men.\n\nAnd yet that is but crudely stated. It needs the poet\nthere. With the boys of his school, Adolph Myers had\nwalked in the evening or had sat talking until dusk\nupon the schoolhouse steps lost in a kind of dream.\nHere and there went his hands, caressing the shoulders\nof the boys, playing about the tousled heads. As he\ntalked his voice became soft and musical. There was a\ncaress in that also. In a way the voice and the hands,\nthe stroking of the shoulders and the touching of the\nhair were a part of the schoolmaster's effort to carry\na dream into the young minds. By the caress that was in\nhis fingers he expressed himself. He was one of those\nmen in whom the force that creates life is diffused,\nnot centralized. Under the caress of his hands doubt\nand disbelief went out of the minds of the boys and\nthey began also to dream.\n\nAnd then the tragedy. A half-witted boy of the school\nbecame enamored of the young master. In his bed at\nnight he imagined unspeakable things and in the morning\nwent forth to tell his dreams as facts. Strange,\nhideous accusations fell from his loosehung lips.\nThrough the Pennsylvania town went a shiver. Hidden,\nshadowy doubts that had been in men's minds concerning\nAdolph Myers were galvanized into beliefs.\n\nThe tragedy did not linger. Trembling lads were jerked\nout of bed and questioned. \"He put his arms about me,\"\nsaid one. \"His fingers were always playing in my hair,\"\nsaid another.\n\nOne afternoon a man of the town, Henry Bradford, who\nkept a saloon, came to the schoolhouse door. Calling\nAdolph Myers into the school yard he began to beat him\nwith his fists. As his hard knuckles beat down into the\nfrightened face of the school-master, his wrath became\nmore and more terrible. Screaming with dismay, the\nchildren ran here and there like disturbed insects.\n\"I'll teach you to put your hands on my boy, you\nbeast,\" roared the saloon keeper, who, tired of beating\nthe master, had begun to kick him about the yard.\n\nAdolph Myers was driven from the Pennsylvania town in\nthe night. With lanterns in their hands a dozen men\ncame to the door of the house where he lived alone and\ncommanded that he dress and come forth. It was raining\nand one of the men had a rope in his hands. They had\nintended to hang the school-master, but something in his\nfigure, so small, white, and pitiful, touched their\nhearts and they let him escape. As he ran away into the\ndarkness they repented of their weakness and ran after\nhim, swearing and throwing sticks and great balls of\nsoft mud at the figure that screamed and ran faster and\nfaster into the darkness.\n\nFor twenty years Adolph Myers had lived alone in\nWinesburg. He was but forty but looked sixty-five. The\nname of Biddlebaum he got from a box of goods seen at a\nfreight station as he hurried through an eastern Ohio\ntown. He had an aunt in Winesburg, a black-toothed old\nwoman who raised chickens, and with her he lived until\nshe died. He had been ill for a year after the\nexperience in Pennsylvania, and after his recovery\nworked as a day laborer in the fields, going timidly\nabout and striving to conceal his hands. Although he\ndid not understand what had happened he felt that the\nhands must be to blame. Again and again the fathers of\nthe boys had talked of the hands. \"Keep your hands to\nyourself,\" the saloon keeper had roared, dancing, with\nfury in the schoolhouse yard.\n\nUpon the veranda of his house by the ravine, Wing\nBiddlebaum continued to walk up and down until the sun\nhad disappeared and the road beyond the field was lost\nin the grey shadows. Going into his house he cut slices\nof bread and spread honey upon them. When the rumble of\nthe evening train that took away the express cars\nloaded with the day's harvest of berries had passed and\nrestored the silence of the summer night, he went again\nto walk upon the veranda. In the darkness he could not\nsee the hands and they became quiet. Although he still\nhungered for the presence of the boy, who was the\nmedium through which he expressed his love of man, the\nhunger became again a part of his loneliness and his\nwaiting. Lighting a lamp, Wing Biddlebaum washed the\nfew dishes soiled by his simple meal and, setting up a\nfolding cot by the screen door that led to the porch,\nprepared to undress for the night. A few stray white\nbread crumbs lay on the cleanly washed floor by the\ntable; putting the lamp upon a low stool he began to\npick up the crumbs, carrying them to his mouth one by\none with unbelievable rapidity. In the dense blotch of\nlight beneath the table, the kneeling figure looked\nlike a priest engaged in some service of his church.\nThe nervous expressive fingers, flashing in and out of\nthe light, might well have been mistaken for the\nfingers of the devotee going swiftly through decade\nafter decade of his rosary.\n\n\n\nPAPER PILLS\n\nHe was an old man with a white beard and huge nose and\nhands. Long before the time during which we will know\nhim, he was a doctor and drove a jaded white horse from\nhouse to house through the streets of Winesburg. Later\nhe married a girl who had money. She had been left a\nlarge fertile farm when her father died. The girl was\nquiet, tall, and dark, and to many people she seemed\nvery beautiful. Everyone in Winesburg wondered why she\nmarried the doctor. Within a year after the marriage\nshe died.\n\nThe knuckles of the doctor's hands were extraordinarily\nlarge. When the hands were closed they looked like\nclusters of unpainted wooden balls as large as walnuts\nfastened together by steel rods. He smoked a cob pipe\nand after his wife's death sat all day in his empty\noffice close by a window that was covered with cobwebs.\nHe never opened the window. Once on a hot day in August\nhe tried but found it stuck fast and after that he\nforgot all about it.\n\nWinesburg had forgotten the old man, but in Doctor\nReefy there were the seeds of something very fine.\nAlone in his musty office in the Heffner Block above\nthe Paris Dry Goods Company's store, he worked\nceaselessly, building up something that he himself\ndestroyed. Little pyramids of truth he erected and\nafter erecting knocked them down again that he might\nhave the truths to erect other pyramids.\n\nDoctor Reefy was a tall man who had worn one suit of\nclothes for ten years. It was frayed at the sleeves and\nlittle holes had appeared at the knees and elbows. In\nthe office he wore also a linen duster with huge\npockets into which he continually stuffed scraps of\npaper. After some weeks the scraps of paper became\nlittle hard round balls, and when the pockets were\nfilled he dumped them out upon the floor. For ten years\nhe had but one friend, another old man named John\nSpaniard who owned a tree nursery. Sometimes, in a\nplayful mood, old Doctor Reefy took from his pockets a\nhandful of the paper balls and threw them at the\nnursery man. \"That is to confound you, you blathering\nold sentimentalist,\" he cried, shaking with laughter.\n\nThe story of Doctor Reefy and his courtship of the tall\ndark girl who became his wife and left her money to him\nis a very curious story. It is delicious, like the\ntwisted little apples that grow in the orchards of\nWinesburg. In the fall one walks in the orchards and\nthe ground is hard with frost underfoot. The apples\nhave been taken from the trees by the pickers. They\nhave been put in barrels and shipped to the cities\nwhere they will be eaten in apartments that are filled\nwith books, magazines, furniture, and people. On the\ntrees are only a few gnarled apples that the pickers\nhave rejected. They look like the knuckles of Doctor\nReefy's hands. One nibbles at them and they are\ndelicious. Into a little round place at the side of the\napple has been gathered all of its sweetness. One runs\nfrom tree to tree over the frosted ground picking the\ngnarled, twisted apples and filling his pockets with\nthem. Only the few know the sweetness of the twisted\napples.\n\nThe girl and Doctor Reefy began their courtship on a\nsummer afternoon. He was forty-five then and already he\nhad begun the practice of filling his pockets with the\nscraps of paper that became hard balls and were thrown\naway. The habit had been formed as he sat in his buggy\nbehind the jaded white horse and went slowly along\ncountry roads. On the papers were written thoughts,\nends of thoughts, beginnings of thoughts.\n\nOne by one the mind of Doctor Reefy had made the\nthoughts. Out of many of them he formed a truth that\narose gigantic in his mind. The truth clouded the\nworld. It became terrible and then faded away and the\nlittle thoughts began again.\n\nThe tall dark girl came to see Doctor Reefy because she\nwas in the family way and had become frightened. She\nwas in that condition because of a series of\ncircumstances also curious.\n\nThe death of her father and mother and the rich acres\nof land that had come down to her had set a train of\nsuitors on her heels. For two years she saw suitors\nalmost every evening. Except two they were all alike.\nThey talked to her of passion and there was a strained\neager quality in their voices and in their eyes when\nthey looked at her. The two who were different were\nmuch unlike each other. One of them, a slender young\nman with white hands, the son of a jeweler in\nWinesburg, talked continually of virginity. When he was\nwith her he was never off the subject. The other, a\nblack-haired boy with large ears, said nothing at all\nbut always managed to get her into the darkness, where\nhe began to kiss her.\n\nFor a time the tall dark girl thought she would marry\nthe jeweler's son. For hours she sat in silence\nlistening as he talked to her and then she began to be\nafraid of something. Beneath his talk of virginity she\nbegan to think there was a lust greater than in all the\nothers. At times it seemed to her that as he talked he\nwas holding her body in his hands. She imagined him\nturning it slowly about in the white hands and staring\nat it. At night she dreamed that he had bitten into her\nbody and that his jaws were dripping. She had the dream\nthree times, then she became in the family way to the\none who said nothing at all but who in the moment of\nhis passion actually did bite her shoulder so that for\ndays the marks of his teeth showed.\n\nAfter the tall dark girl came to know Doctor Reefy it\nseemed to her that she never wanted to leave him again.\nShe went into his office one morning and without her\nsaying anything he seemed to know what had happened to\nher.\n\nIn the office of the doctor there was a woman, the wife\nof the man who kept the bookstore in Winesburg. Like\nall old-fashioned country practitioners, Doctor Reefy\npulled teeth, and the woman who waited held a\nhandkerchief to her teeth and groaned. Her husband was\nwith her and when the tooth was taken out they both\nscreamed and blood ran down on the woman's white dress.\nThe tall dark girl did not pay any attention. When the\nwoman and the man had gone the doctor smiled. \"I will\ntake you driving into the country with me,\" he said.\n\nFor several weeks the tall dark girl and the doctor\nwere together almost every day. The condition that had\nbrought her to him passed in an illness, but she was\nlike one who has discovered the sweetness of the\ntwisted apples, she could not get her mind fixed again\nupon the round perfect fruit that is eaten in the city\napartments. In the fall after the beginning of her\nacquaintanceship with him she married Doctor Reefy and\nin the following spring she died. During the winter he\nread to her all of the odds and ends of thoughts he had\nscribbled on the bits of paper. After he had read them\nhe laughed and stuffed them away in his pockets to\nbecome round hard balls.\n\n\n\n\nMOTHER\n\nElizabeth Willard, the mother of George Willard, was\ntall and gaunt and her face was marked with smallpox\nscars. Although she was but forty-five, some obscure\ndisease had taken the fire out of her figure.\nListlessly she went about the disorderly old hotel\nlooking at the faded wall-paper and the ragged carpets\nand, when she was able to be about, doing the work of a\nchambermaid among beds soiled by the slumbers of fat\ntraveling men. Her husband, Tom Willard, a slender,\ngraceful man with square shoulders, a quick military\nstep, and a black mustache trained to turn sharply up\nat the ends, tried to put the wife out of his mind. The\npresence of the tall ghostly figure, moving slowly\nthrough the halls, he took as a reproach to himself.\nWhen he thought of her he grew angry and swore. The\nhotel was unprofitable and forever on the edge of\nfailure and he wished himself out of it. He thought of\nthe old house and the woman who lived there with him as\nthings defeated and done for. The hotel in which he had\nbegun life so hopefully was now a mere ghost of what a\nhotel should be. As he went spruce and business-like\nthrough the streets of Winesburg, he sometimes stopped\nand turned quickly about as though fearing that the\nspirit of the hotel and of the woman would follow him\neven into the streets. \"Damn such a life, damn it!\" he\nsputtered aimlessly.\n\nTom Willard had a passion for village politics and for\nyears had been the leading Democrat in a strongly\nRepublican community. Some day, he told himself, the\ntide of things political will turn in my favor and the\nyears of ineffectual service count big in the bestowal\nof rewards. He dreamed of going to Congress and even of\nbecoming governor. Once when a younger member of the\nparty arose at a political conference and began to\nboast of his faithful service, Tom Willard grew white\nwith fury. \"Shut up, you,\" he roared, glaring about.\n\"What do you know of service? What are you but a boy?\nLook at what I've done here! I was a Democrat here in\nWinesburg when it was a crime to be a Democrat. In the\nold days they fairly hunted us with guns.\"\n\nBetween Elizabeth and her one son George there was a\ndeep unexpressed bond of sympathy, based on a girlhood\ndream that had long ago died. In the son's presence she\nwas timid and reserved, but sometimes while he hurried\nabout town intent upon his duties as a reporter, she\nwent into his room and closing the door knelt by a\nlittle desk, made of a kitchen table, that sat near a\nwindow. In the room by the desk she went through a\nceremony that was half a prayer, half a demand,\naddressed to the skies. In the boyish figure she\nyearned to see something half forgotten that had once\nbeen a part of herself recreated. The prayer concerned\nthat. \"Even though I die, I will in some way keep\ndefeat from you,\" she cried, and so deep was her\ndetermination that her whole body shook. Her eyes\nglowed and she clenched her fists. \"If I am dead and\nsee him becoming a meaningless drab figure like myself,\nI will come back,\" she declared. \"I ask God now to give\nme that privilege. I demand it. I will pay for it. God\nmay beat me with his fists. I will take any blow that\nmay befall if but this my boy be allowed to express\nsomething for us both.\" Pausing uncertainly, the woman\nstared about the boy's room. \"And do not let him become\nsmart and successful either,\" she added vaguely.\n\nThe communion between George Willard and his mother was\noutwardly a formal thing without meaning. When she was\nill and sat by the window in her room he sometimes went\nin the evening to make her a visit. They sat by a\nwindow that looked over the roof of a small frame\nbuilding into Main Street. By turning their heads they\ncould see through another window, along an alleyway\nthat ran behind the Main Street stores and into the\nback door of Abner Groff's bakery. Sometimes as they\nsat thus a picture of village life presented itself to\nthem. At the back door of his shop appeared Abner Groff\nwith a stick or an empty milk bottle in his hand. For a\nlong time there was a feud between the baker and a grey\ncat that belonged to Sylvester West, the druggist. The\nboy and his mother saw the cat creep into the door of\nthe bakery and presently emerge followed by the baker,\nwho swore and waved his arms about. The baker's eyes\nwere small and red and his black hair and beard were\nfilled with flour dust. Sometimes he was so angry that,\nalthough the cat had disappeared, he hurled sticks,\nbits of broken glass, and even some of the tools of his\ntrade about. Once he broke a window at the back of\nSinning's Hardware Store. In the alley the grey cat\ncrouched behind barrels filled with torn paper and\nbroken bottles above which flew a black swarm of flies.\nOnce when she was alone, and after watching a prolonged\nand ineffectual outburst on the part of the baker,\nElizabeth Willard put her head down on her long white\nhands and wept. After that she did not look along the\nalleyway any more, but tried to forget the contest\nbetween the bearded man and the cat. It seemed like a\nrehearsal of her own life, terrible in its vividness.\n\nIn the evening when the son sat in the room with his\nmother, the silence made them both feel awkward.\nDarkness came on and the evening train came in at the\nstation. In the street below feet tramped up and down\nupon a board sidewalk. In the station yard, after the\nevening train had gone, there was a heavy silence.\nPerhaps Skinner Leason, the express agent, moved a\ntruck the length of the station platform. Over on Main\nStreet sounded a man's voice, laughing. The door of the\nexpress office banged. George Willard arose and\ncrossing the room fumbled for the doorknob. Sometimes\nhe knocked against a chair, making it scrape along the\nfloor. By the window sat the sick woman, perfectly\nstill, listless. Her long hands, white and bloodless,\ncould be seen drooping over the ends of the arms of the\nchair. \"I think you had better be out among the boys.\nYou are too much indoors,\" she said, striving to\nrelieve the embarrassment of the departure. \"I thought\nI would take a walk,\" replied George Willard, who felt\nawkward and confused.\n\nOne evening in July, when the transient guests who made\nthe New Willard House their temporary home had become\nscarce, and the hallways, lighted only by kerosene\nlamps turned low, were plunged in gloom, Elizabeth\nWillard had an adventure. She had been ill in bed for\nseveral days and her son had not come to visit her. She\nwas alarmed. The feeble blaze of life that remained in\nher body was blown into a flame by her anxiety and she\ncrept out of bed, dressed and hurried along the hallway\ntoward her son's room, shaking with exaggerated fears.\nAs she went along she steadied herself with her hand,\nslipped along the papered walls of the hall and\nbreathed with difficulty. The air whistled through her\nteeth. As she hurried forward she thought how foolish\nshe was. \"He is concerned with boyish affairs,\" she\ntold herself. \"Perhaps he has now begun to walk about\nin the evening with girls.\"\n\nElizabeth Willard had a dread of being seen by guests\nin the hotel that had once belonged to her father and\nthe ownership of which still stood recorded in her name\nin the county courthouse. The hotel was continually\nlosing patronage because of its shabbiness and she\nthought of herself as also shabby. Her own room was in\nan obscure corner and when she felt able to work she\nvoluntarily worked among the beds, preferring the labor\nthat could be done when the guests were abroad seeking\ntrade among the merchants of Winesburg.\n\nBy the door of her son's room the mother knelt upon the\nfloor and listened for some sound from within. When she\nheard the boy moving about and talking in low tones a\nsmile came to her lips. George Willard had a habit of\ntalking aloud to himself and to hear him doing so had\nalways given his mother a peculiar pleasure. The habit\nin him, she felt, strengthened the secret bond that\nexisted between them. A thousand times she had\nwhispered to herself of the matter. \"He is groping\nabout, trying to find himself,\" she thought. \"He is not\na dull clod, all words and smartness. Within him there\nis a secret something that is striving to grow. It is\nthe thing I let be killed in myself.\"\n\nIn the darkness in the hallway by the door the sick\nwoman arose and started again toward her own room. She\nwas afraid that the door would open and the boy come\nupon her. When she had reached a safe distance and was\nabout to turn a corner into a second hallway she\nstopped and bracing herself with her hands waited,\nthinking to shake off a trembling fit of weakness that\nhad come upon her. The presence of the boy in the room\nhad made her happy. In her bed, during the long hours\nalone, the little fears that had visited her had become\ngiants. Now they were all gone. \"When I get back to my\nroom I shall sleep,\" she murmured gratefully.\n\nBut Elizabeth Willard was not to return to her bed and\nto sleep. As she stood trembling in the darkness the\ndoor of her son's room opened and the boy's father, Tom\nWillard, stepped out. In the light that steamed out at\nthe door he stood with the knob in his hand and talked.\nWhat he said infuriated the woman.\n\nTom Willard was ambitious for his son. He had always\nthought of himself as a successful man, although\nnothing he had ever done had turned out successfully.\nHowever, when he was out of sight of the New Willard\nHouse and had no fear of coming upon his wife, he\nswaggered and began to dramatize himself as one of the\nchief men of the town. He wanted his son to succeed. He\nit was who had secured for the boy the position on the\nWinesburg Eagle. Now, with a ring of earnestness in his\nvoice, he was advising concerning some course of\nconduct. \"I tell you what, George, you've got to wake\nup,\" he said sharply. \"Will Henderson has spoken to me\nthree times concerning the matter. He says you go along\nfor hours not hearing when you are spoken to and acting\nlike a gawky girl. What ails you?\" Tom Willard laughed\ngood-naturedly. \"Well, I guess you'll get over it,\" he\nsaid. \"I told Will that. You're not a fool and you're\nnot a woman. You're Tom Willard's son and you'll wake\nup. I'm not afraid. What you say clears things up. If\nbeing a newspaper man had put the notion of becoming a\nwriter into your mind that's all right. Only I guess\nyou'll have to wake up to do that too, eh?\"\n\nTom Willard went briskly along the hallway and down a\nflight of stairs to the office. The woman in the\ndarkness could hear him laughing and talking with a\nguest who was striving to wear away a dull evening by\ndozing in a chair by the office door. She returned to\nthe door of her son's room. The weakness had passed\nfrom her body as by a miracle and she stepped boldly\nalong. A thousand ideas raced through her head. When\nshe heard the scraping of a chair and the sound of a\npen scratching upon paper, she again turned and went\nback along the hallway to her own room.\n\nA definite determination had come into the mind of the\ndefeated wife of the Winesburg hotel keeper. The\ndetermination was the result of long years of quiet and\nrather ineffectual thinking. \"Now,\" she told herself,\n\"I will act. There is something threatening my boy and\nI will ward it off.\" The fact that the conversation\nbetween Tom Willard and his son had been rather quiet\nand natural, as though an understanding existed between\nthem, maddened her. Although for years she had hated\nher husband, her hatred had always before been a quite\nimpersonal thing. He had been merely a part of\nsomething else that she hated. Now, and by the few\nwords at the door, he had become the thing personified.\nIn the darkness of her own room she clenched her fists\nand glared about. Going to a cloth bag that hung on a\nnail by the wall she took out a long pair of sewing\nscissors and held them in her hand like a dagger. \"I\nwill stab him,\" she said aloud. \"He has chosen to be\nthe voice of evil and I will kill him. When I have\nkilled him something will snap within myself and I will\ndie also. It will be a release for all of us.\"\n\nIn her girlhood and before her marriage with Tom\nWillard, Elizabeth had borne a somewhat shaky\nreputation in Winesburg. For years she had been what is\ncalled \"stage-struck\" and had paraded through the\nstreets with traveling men guests at her father's\nhotel, wearing loud clothes and urging them to tell her\nof life in the cities out of which they had come. Once\nshe startled the town by putting on men's clothes and\nriding a bicycle down Main Street.\n\nIn her own mind the tall dark girl had been in those\ndays much confused. A great restlessness was in her and\nit expressed itself in two ways. First there was an\nuneasy desire for change, for some big definite\nmovement to her life. It was this feeling that had\nturned her mind to the stage. She dreamed of joining\nsome company and wandering over the world, seeing\nalways new faces and giving something out of herself to\nall people. Sometimes at night she was quite beside\nherself with the thought, but when she tried to talk of\nthe matter to the members of the theatrical companies\nthat came to Winesburg and stopped at her father's\nhotel, she got nowhere. They did not seem to know what\nshe meant, or if she did get something of her passion\nexpressed, they only laughed. \"It's not like that,\"\nthey said. \"It's as dull and uninteresting as this\nhere. Nothing comes of it.\"\n\nWith the traveling men when she walked about with them,\nand later with Tom Willard, it was quite different.\nAlways they seemed to understand and sympathize with\nher. On the side streets of the village, in the\ndarkness under the trees, they took hold of her hand\nand she thought that something unexpressed in herself\ncame forth and became a part of an unexpressed\nsomething in them.\n\nAnd then there was the second expression of her\nrestlessness. When that came she felt for a time\nreleased and happy. She did not blame the men who\nwalked with her and later she did not blame Tom\nWillard. It was always the same, beginning with kisses\nand ending, after strange wild emotions, with peace and\nthen sobbing repentance. When she sobbed she put her\nhand upon the face of the man and had always the same\nthought. Even though he were large and bearded she\nthought he had become suddenly a little boy. She\nwondered why he did not sob also.\n\nIn her room, tucked away in a corner of the old Willard\nHouse, Elizabeth Willard lighted a lamp and put it on a\ndressing table that stood by the door. A thought had\ncome into her mind and she went to a closet and brought\nout a small square box and set it on the table. The box\ncontained material for make-up and had been left with\nother things by a theatrical company that had once been\nstranded in Winesburg. Elizabeth Willard had decided\nthat she would be beautiful. Her hair was still black\nand there was a great mass of it braided and coiled\nabout her head. The scene that was to take place in the\noffice below began to grow in her mind. No ghostly\nworn-out figure should confront Tom Willard, but\nsomething quite unexpected and startling. Tall and with\ndusky cheeks and hair that fell in a mass from her\nshoulders, a figure should come striding down the\nstairway before the startled loungers in the hotel\noffice. The figure would be silent--it would be swift\nand terrible. As a tigress whose cub had been\nthreatened would she appear, coming out of the shadows,\nstealing noiselessly along and holding the long wicked\nscissors in her hand.\n\nWith a little broken sob in her throat, Elizabeth\nWillard blew out the light that stood upon the table\nand stood weak and trembling in the darkness. The\nstrength that had been as a miracle in her body left\nand she half reeled across the floor, clutching at the\nback of the chair in which she had spent so many long\ndays staring out over the tin roofs into the main\nstreet of Winesburg. In the hallway there was the sound\nof footsteps and George Willard came in at the door.\nSitting in a chair beside his mother he began to talk.\n\"I'm going to get out of here,\" he said. \"I don't know\nwhere I shall go or what I shall do but I am going\naway.\"\n\nThe woman in the chair waited and trembled. An impulse\ncame to her. \"I suppose you had better wake up,\" she\nsaid. \"You think that? You will go to the city and make\nmoney, eh? It will be better for you, you think, to be\na business man, to be brisk and smart and alive?\" She\nwaited and trembled.\n\nThe son shook his head. \"I suppose I can't make you\nunderstand, but oh, I wish I could,\" he said earnestly.\n\"I can't even talk to father about it. I don't try.\nThere isn't any use. I don't know what I shall do. I\njust want to go away and look at people and think.\"\n\nSilence fell upon the room where the boy and woman sat\ntogether. Again, as on the other evenings, they were\nembarrassed. After a time the boy tried again to talk.\n\"I suppose it won't be for a year or two but I've been\nthinking about it,\" he said, rising and going toward\nthe door. \"Something father said makes it sure that I\nshall have to go away.\" He fumbled with the doorknob.\nIn the room the silence became unbearable to the woman.\nShe wanted to cry out with joy because of the words\nthat had come from the lips of her son, but the\nexpression of joy had become impossible to her. \"I\nthink you had better go out among the boys. You are too\nmuch indoors,\" she said. \"I thought I would go for a\nlittle walk,\" replied the son stepping awkwardly out of\nthe room and closing the door.\n\n\n\n\nTHE PHILOSOPHER\n\nDoctor Parcival was a large man with a drooping mouth\ncovered by a yellow mustache. He always wore a dirty\nwhite waistcoat out of the pockets of which protruded a\nnumber of the kind of black cigars known as stogies.\nHis teeth were black and irregular and there was\nsomething strange about his eyes. The lid of the left\neye twitched; it fell down and snapped up; it was\nexactly as though the lid of the eye were a window\nshade and someone stood inside the doctor's head\nplaying with the cord.\n\nDoctor Parcival had a liking for the boy, George\nWillard. It began when George had been working for a\nyear on the Winesburg Eagle and the acquaintanceship\nwas entirely a matter of the doctor's own making.\n\nIn the late afternoon Will Henderson, owner and editor\nof the Eagle, went over to Tom Willy's saloon. Along an\nalleyway he went and slipping in at the back door of\nthe saloon began drinking a drink made of a combination\nof sloe gin and soda water. Will Henderson was a\nsensualist and had reached the age of forty-five. He\nimagined the gin renewed the youth in him. Like most\nsensualists he enjoyed talking of women, and for an\nhour he lingered about gossiping with Tom Willy. The\nsaloon keeper was a short, broad-shouldered man with\npeculiarly marked hands. That flaming kind of birthmark\nthat sometimes paints with red the faces of men and\nwomen had touched with red Tom Willy's fingers and the\nbacks of his hands. As he stood by the bar talking to\nWill Henderson he rubbed the hands together. As he grew\nmore and more excited the red of his fingers deepened.\nIt was as though the hands had been dipped in blood\nthat had dried and faded.\n\nAs Will Henderson stood at the bar looking at the red\nhands and talking of women, his assistant, George\nWillard, sat in the office of the Winesburg Eagle and\nlistened to the talk of Doctor Parcival.\n\nDoctor Parcival appeared immediately after Will\nHenderson had disappeared. One might have supposed that\nthe doctor had been watching from his office window and\nhad seen the editor going along the alleyway. Coming in\nat the front door and finding himself a chair, he\nlighted one of the stogies and crossing his legs began\nto talk. He seemed intent upon convincing the boy of\nthe advisability of adopting a line of conduct that he\nwas himself unable to define.\n\n\"If you have your eyes open you will see that although\nI call myself a doctor I have mighty few patients,\" he\nbegan. \"There is a reason for that. It is not an\naccident and it is not because I do not know as much of\nmedicine as anyone here. I do not want patients. The\nreason, you see, does not appear on the surface. It\nlies in fact in my character, which has, if you think\nabout it, many strange turns. Why I want to talk to you\nof the matter I don't know. I might keep still and get\nmore credit in your eyes. I have a desire to make you\nadmire me, that's a fact. I don't know why. That's why\nI talk. It's very amusing, eh?\"\n\nSometimes the doctor launched into long tales\nconcerning himself. To the boy the tales were very real\nand full of meaning. He began to admire the fat\nunclean-looking man and, in the afternoon when Will\nHenderson had gone, looked forward with keen interest\nto the doctor's coming.\n\nDoctor Parcival had been in Winesburg about five years.\nHe came from Chicago and when he arrived was drunk and\ngot into a fight with Albert Longworth, the baggageman.\nThe fight concerned a trunk and ended by the doctor's\nbeing escorted to the village lockup. When he was\nreleased he rented a room above a shoe-repairing shop\nat the lower end of Main Street and put out the sign\nthat announced himself as a doctor. Although he had but\nfew patients and these of the poorer sort who were\nunable to pay, he seemed to have plenty of money for\nhis needs. He slept in the office that was unspeakably\ndirty and dined at Biff Carter's lunch room in a small\nframe building opposite the railroad station. In the\nsummer the lunch room was filled with flies and Biff\nCarter's white apron was more dirty than his floor.\nDoctor Parcival did not mind. Into the lunch room he\nstalked and deposited twenty cents upon the counter.\n\"Feed me what you wish for that,\" he said laughing.\n\"Use up food that you wouldn't otherwise sell. It makes\nno difference to me. I am a man of distinction, you\nsee. Why should I concern myself with what I eat.\"\n\nThe tales that Doctor Parcival told George Willard\nbegan nowhere and ended nowhere. Sometimes the boy\nthought they must all be inventions, a pack of lies.\nAnd then again he was convinced that they contained the\nvery essence of truth.\n\n\"I was a reporter like you here,\" Doctor Parcival\nbegan. \"It was in a town in Iowa--or was it in\nIllinois? I don't remember and anyway it makes no\ndifference. Perhaps I am trying to conceal my identity\nand don't want to be very definite. Have you ever\nthought it strange that I have money for my needs\nalthough I do nothing? I may have stolen a great sum of\nmoney or been involved in a murder before I came here.\nThere is food for thought in that, eh? If you were a\nreally smart newspaper reporter you would look me up.\nIn Chicago there was a Doctor Cronin who was murdered.\nHave you heard of that? Some men murdered him and put\nhim in a trunk. In the early morning they hauled the\ntrunk across the city. It sat on the back of an express\nwagon and they were on the seat as unconcerned as\nanything. Along they went through quiet streets where\neveryone was asleep. The sun was just coming up over\nthe lake. Funny, eh--just to think of them smoking\npipes and chattering as they drove along as unconcerned\nas I am now. Perhaps I was one of those men. That would\nbe a strange turn of things, now wouldn't it, eh?\"\nAgain Doctor Parcival began his tale: \"Well, anyway\nthere I was, a reporter on a paper just as you are\nhere, running about and getting little items to print.\nMy mother was poor. She took in washing. Her dream was\nto make me a Presbyterian minister and I was studying\nwith that end in view.\n\n\"My father had been insane for a number of years. He\nwas in an asylum over at Dayton, Ohio. There you see I\nhave let it slip out! All of this took place in Ohio,\nright here in Ohio. There is a clew if you ever get the\nnotion of looking me up.\n\n\"I was going to tell you of my brother. That's the\nobject of all this. That's what I'm getting at. My\nbrother was a railroad painter and had a job on the Big\nFour. You know that road runs through Ohio here. With\nother men he lived in a box car and away they went from\ntown to town painting the railroad property-switches,\ncrossing gates, bridges, and stations.\n\n\"The Big Four paints its stations a nasty orange color.\nHow I hated that color! My brother was always covered\nwith it. On pay days he used to get drunk and come home\nwearing his paint-covered clothes and bringing his\nmoney with him. He did not give it to mother but laid\nit in a pile on our kitchen table.\n\n\"About the house he went in the clothes covered with\nthe nasty orange colored paint. I can see the picture.\nMy mother, who was small and had red, sad-looking eyes,\nwould come into the house from a little shed at the\nback. That's where she spent her time over the washtub\nscrubbing people's dirty clothes. In she would come and\nstand by the table, rubbing her eyes with her apron\nthat was covered with soap-suds.\n\n\"'Don't touch it! Don't you dare touch that money,' my\nbrother roared, and then he himself took five or ten\ndollars and went tramping off to the saloons. When he\nhad spent what he had taken he came back for more. He\nnever gave my mother any money at all but stayed about\nuntil he had spent it all, a little at a time. Then he\nwent back to his job with the painting crew on the\nrailroad. After he had gone things began to arrive at\nour house, groceries and such things. Sometimes there\nwould be a dress for mother or a pair of shoes for me.\n\n\"Strange, eh? My mother loved my brother much more than\nshe did me, although he never said a kind word to\neither of us and always raved up and down threatening\nus if we dared so much as touch the money that\nsometimes lay on the table three days.\n\n\"We got along pretty well. I studied to be a minister\nand prayed. I was a regular ass about saying prayers.\nYou should have heard me. When my father died I prayed\nall night, just as I did sometimes when my brother was\nin town drinking and going about buying the things for\nus. In the evening after supper I knelt by the table\nwhere the money lay and prayed for hours. When no one\nwas looking I stole a dollar or two and put it in my\npocket. That makes me laugh now but then it was\nterrible. It was on my mind all the time. I got six\ndollars a week from my job on the paper and always took\nit straight home to mother. The few dollars I stole\nfrom my brother's pile I spent on myself, you know, for\ntrifles, candy and cigarettes and such things.\n\n\"When my father died at the asylum over at Dayton, I\nwent over there. I borrowed some money from the man for\nwhom I worked and went on the train at night. It was\nraining. In the asylum they treated me as though I were\na king.\n\n\"The men who had jobs in the asylum had found out I was\na newspaper reporter. That made them afraid. There had\nbeen some negligence, some carelessness, you see, when\nfather was ill. They thought perhaps I would write it\nup in the paper and make a fuss. I never intended to do\nanything of the kind.\n\n\"Anyway, in I went to the room where my father lay dead\nand blessed the dead body. I wonder what put that\nnotion into my head. Wouldn't my brother, the painter,\nhave laughed, though. There I stood over the dead body\nand spread out my hands. The superintendent of the\nasylum and some of his helpers came in and stood about\nlooking sheepish. It was very amusing. I spread out my\nhands and said, 'Let peace brood over this carcass.'\nThat's what I said.\"\n\nJumping to his feet and breaking off the tale, Doctor\nParcival began to walk up and down in the office of the\nWinesburg Eagle where George Willard sat listening. He\nwas awkward and, as the office was small, continually\nknocked against things. \"What a fool I am to be\ntalking,\" he said. \"That is not my object in coming\nhere and forcing my acquaintanceship upon you. I have\nsomething else in mind. You are a reporter just as I\nwas once and you have attracted my attention. You may\nend by becoming just such another fool. I want to warn\nyou and keep on warning you. That's why I seek you\nout.\"\n\nDoctor Parcival began talking of George Willard's\nattitude toward men. It seemed to the boy that the man\nhad but one object in view, to make everyone seem\ndespicable. \"I want to fill you with hatred and\ncontempt so that you will be a superior being,\" he\ndeclared. \"Look at my brother. There was a fellow, eh?\nHe despised everyone, you see. You have no idea with\nwhat contempt he looked upon mother and me. And was he\nnot our superior? You know he was. You have not seen\nhim and yet I have made you feel that. I have given you\na sense of it. He is dead. Once when he was drunk he\nlay down on the tracks and the car in which he lived\nwith the other painters ran over him.\"\n\n            *       *       *\n\nOne day in August Doctor Parcival had an adventure in\nWinesburg. For a month George Willard had been going\neach morning to spend an hour in the doctor's office.\nThe visits came about through a desire on the part of\nthe doctor to read to the boy from the pages of a book\nhe was in the process of writing. To write the book\nDoctor Parcival declared was the object of his coming\nto Winesburg to live.\n\nOn the morning in August before the coming of the boy,\nan incident had happened in the doctor's office. There\nhad been an accident on Main Street. A team of horses\nhad been frightened by a train and had run away. A\nlittle girl, the daughter of a farmer, had been thrown\nfrom a buggy and killed.\n\nOn Main Street everyone had become excited and a cry\nfor doctors had gone up. All three of the active\npractitioners of the town had come quickly but had\nfound the child dead. From the crowd someone had run to\nthe office of Doctor Parcival who had bluntly refused\nto go down out of his office to the dead child. The\nuseless cruelty of his refusal had passed unnoticed.\nIndeed, the man who had come up the stairway to summon\nhim had hurried away without hearing the refusal.\n\nAll of this, Doctor Parcival did not know and when\nGeorge Willard came to his office he found the man\nshaking with terror. \"What I have done will arouse the\npeople of this town,\" he declared excitedly. \"Do I not\nknow human nature? Do I not know what will happen? Word\nof my refusal will be whispered about. Presently men\nwill get together in groups and talk of it. They will\ncome here. We will quarrel and there will be talk of\nhanging. Then they will come again bearing a rope in\ntheir hands.\"\n\nDoctor Parcival shook with fright. \"I have a\npresentiment,\" he declared emphatically. \"It may be\nthat what I am talking about will not occur this\nmorning. It may be put off until tonight but I will be\nhanged. Everyone will get excited. I will be hanged to\na lamp-post on Main Street.\"\n\nGoing to the door of his dirty office, Doctor Parcival\nlooked timidly down the stairway leading to the street.\nWhen he returned the fright that had been in his eyes\nwas beginning to be replaced by doubt. Coming on tiptoe\nacross the room he tapped George Willard on the\nshoulder. \"If not now, sometime,\" he whispered, shaking\nhis head. \"In the end I will be crucified, uselessly\ncrucified.\"\n\nDoctor Parcival began to plead with George Willard.\n\"You must pay attention to me,\" he urged. \"If something\nhappens perhaps you will be able to write the book that\nI may never get written. The idea is very simple, so\nsimple that if you are not careful you will forget it.\nIt is this--that everyone in the world is Christ and\nthey are all crucified. That's what I want to say.\nDon't you forget that. Whatever happens, don't you dare\nlet yourself forget.\"\n\n\n\n\nNOBODY KNOWS\n\nLooking cautiously about, George Willard arose from his\ndesk in the office of the Winesburg Eagle and went\nhurriedly out at the back door. The night was warm and\ncloudy and although it was not yet eight o'clock, the\nalleyway back of the Eagle office was pitch dark. A\nteam of horses tied to a post somewhere in the darkness\nstamped on the hard-baked ground. A cat sprang from\nunder George Willard's feet and ran away into the\nnight. The young man was nervous. All day he had gone\nabout his work like one dazed by a blow. In the\nalleyway he trembled as though with fright.\n\nIn the darkness George Willard walked along the\nalleyway, going carefully and cautiously. The back\ndoors of the Winesburg stores were open and he could\nsee men sitting about under the store lamps. In\nMyerbaum's Notion Store Mrs. Willy the saloon keeper's\nwife stood by the counter with a basket on her arm. Sid\nGreen the clerk was waiting on her. He leaned over the\ncounter and talked earnestly.\n\nGeorge Willard crouched and then jumped through the\npath of light that came out at the door. He began to\nrun forward in the darkness. Behind Ed Griffith's\nsaloon old Jerry Bird the town drunkard lay asleep on\nthe ground. The runner stumbled over the sprawling\nlegs. He laughed brokenly.\n\nGeorge Willard had set forth upon an adventure. All day\nhe had been trying to make up his mind to go through\nwith the adventure and now he was acting. In the office\nof the Winesburg Eagle he had been sitting since six\no'clock trying to think.\n\nThere had been no decision. He had just jumped to his\nfeet, hurried past Will Henderson who was reading proof\nin the printshop and started to run along the alleyway.\n\nThrough street after street went George Willard,\navoiding the people who passed. He crossed and\nrecrossed the road. When he passed a street lamp he\npulled his hat down over his face. He did not dare\nthink. In his mind there was a fear but it was a new\nkind of fear. He was afraid the adventure on which he\nhad set out would be spoiled, that he would lose\ncourage and turn back.\n\nGeorge Willard found Louise Trunnion in the kitchen of\nher father's house. She was washing dishes by the light\nof a kerosene lamp. There she stood behind the screen\ndoor in the little shedlike kitchen at the back of the\nhouse. George Willard stopped by a picket fence and\ntried to control the shaking of his body. Only a narrow\npotato patch separated him from the adventure. Five\nminutes passed before he felt sure enough of himself to\ncall to her. \"Louise! Oh, Louise!\" he called. The cry\nstuck in his throat. His voice became a hoarse whisper.\n\nLouise Trunnion came out across the potato patch\nholding the dish cloth in her hand. \"How do you know I\nwant to go out with you,\" she said sulkily. \"What makes\nyou so sure?\"\n\nGeorge Willard did not answer. In silence the two\nstood in the darkness with the fence between them. \"You\ngo on along,\" she said. \"Pa's in there. I'll come\nalong. You wait by Williams' barn.\"\n\nThe young newspaper reporter had received a letter from\nLouise Trunnion. It had come that morning to the office\nof the Winesburg Eagle. The letter was brief. \"I'm\nyours if you want me,\" it said. He thought it annoying\nthat in the darkness by the fence she had pretended\nthere was nothing between them. \"She has a nerve! Well,\ngracious sakes, she has a nerve,\" he muttered as he\nwent along the street and passed a row of vacant lots\nwhere corn grew. The corn was shoulder high and had\nbeen planted right down to the sidewalk.\n\nWhen Louise Trunnion came out of the front door of her\nhouse she still wore the gingham dress in which she had\nbeen washing dishes. There was no hat on her head. The\nboy could see her standing with the doorknob in her\nhand talking to someone within, no doubt to old Jake\nTrunnion, her father. Old Jake was half deaf and she\nshouted. The door closed and everything was dark and\nsilent in the little side street. George Willard\ntrembled more violently than ever.\n\nIn the shadows by Williams' barn George and Louise\nstood, not daring to talk. She was not particularly\ncomely and there was a black smudge on the side of her\nnose. George thought she must have rubbed her nose with\nher finger after she had been handling some of the\nkitchen pots.\n\nThe young man began to laugh nervously. \"It's warm,\"\nhe said. He wanted to touch her with his hand. \"I'm not\nvery bold,\" he thought. Just to touch the folds of the\nsoiled gingham dress would, he decided, be an exquisite\npleasure. She began to quibble. \"You think you're\nbetter than I am. Don't tell me, I guess I know,\" she\nsaid drawing closer to him.\n\nA flood of words burst from George Willard. He\nremembered the look that had lurked in the girl's eyes\nwhen they had met on the streets and thought of the\nnote she had written. Doubt left him. The whispered\ntales concerning her that had gone about town gave him\nconfidence. He became wholly the male, bold and\naggressive. In his heart there was no sympathy for her.\n\"Ah, come on, it'll be all right. There won't be anyone\nknow anything. How can they know?\" he urged.\n\nThey began to walk along a narrow brick sidewalk\nbetween the cracks of which tall weeds grew. Some of\nthe bricks were missing and the sidewalk was rough and\nirregular. He took hold of her hand that was also rough\nand thought it delightfully small. \"I can't go far,\"\nshe said and her voice was quiet, unperturbed.\n\nThey crossed a bridge that ran over a tiny stream and\npassed another vacant lot in which corn grew. The\nstreet ended. In the path at the side of the road they\nwere compelled to walk one behind the other. Will\nOverton's berry field lay beside the road and there was\na pile of boards. \"Will is going to build a shed to\nstore berry crates here,\" said George and they sat down\nupon the boards.\n\n            *       *       *\n\nWhen George Willard got back into Main Street it was\npast ten o'clock and had begun to rain. Three times he\nwalked up and down the length of Main Street. Sylvester\nWest's Drug Store was still open and he went in and\nbought a cigar. When Shorty Crandall the clerk came out\nat the door with him he was pleased. For five minutes\nthe two stood in the shelter of the store awning and\ntalked. George Willard felt satisfied. He had wanted\nmore than anything else to talk to some man. Around a\ncorner toward the New Willard House he went whistling\nsoftly.\n\nOn the sidewalk at the side of Winney's Dry Goods Store\nwhere there was a high board fence covered with circus\npictures, he stopped whistling and stood perfectly\nstill in the darkness, attentive, listening as though\nfor a voice calling his name. Then again he laughed\nnervously. \"She hasn't got anything on me. Nobody\nknows,\" he muttered doggedly and went on his way.\n\n\n\n\nGODLINESS\n\nA Tale in Four Parts\n\nThere were always three or four old people sitting on\nthe front porch of the house or puttering about the\ngarden of the Bentley farm. Three of the old people\nwere women and sisters to Jesse. They were a colorless,\nsoft voiced lot. Then there was a silent old man with\nthin white hair who was Jesse's uncle.\n\nThe farmhouse was built of wood, a board outer-covering\nover a framework of logs. It was in reality not one\nhouse but a cluster of houses joined together in a\nrather haphazard manner. Inside, the place was full of\nsurprises. One went up steps from the living room into\nthe dining room and there were always steps to be\nascended or descended in passing from one room to\nanother. At meal times the place was like a beehive. At\none moment all was quiet, then doors began to open,\nfeet clattered on stairs, a murmur of soft voices arose\nand people appeared from a dozen obscure corners.\n\nBesides the old people, already mentioned, many others\nlived in the Bentley house. There were four hired men,\na woman named Aunt Callie Beebe, who was in charge of\nthe housekeeping, a dull-witted girl named Eliza\nStoughton, who made beds and helped with the milking, a\nboy who worked in the stables, and Jesse Bentley\nhimself, the owner and overlord of it all.\n\nBy the time the American Civil War had been over for\ntwenty years, that part of Northern Ohio where the\nBentley farms lay had begun to emerge from pioneer\nlife. Jesse then owned machinery for harvesting grain.\nHe had built modern barns and most of his land was\ndrained with carefully laid tile drain, but in order to\nunderstand the man we will have to go back to an\nearlier day.\n\nThe Bentley family had been in Northern Ohio for\nseveral generations before Jesse's time. They came from\nNew York State and took up land when the country was\nnew and land could be had at a low price. For a long\ntime they, in common with all the other Middle Western\npeople, were very poor. The land they had settled upon\nwas heavily wooded and covered with fallen logs and\nunderbrush. After the long hard labor of clearing these\naway and cutting the timber, there were still the\nstumps to be reckoned with. Plows run through the\nfields caught on hidden roots, stones lay all about, on\nthe low places water gathered, and the young corn\nturned yellow, sickened and died.\n\nWhen Jesse Bentley's father and brothers had come into\ntheir ownership of the place, much of the harder part\nof the work of clearing had been done, but they clung\nto old traditions and worked like driven animals. They\nlived as practically all of the farming people of the\ntime lived. In the spring and through most of the\nwinter the highways leading into the town of Winesburg\nwere a sea of mud. The four young men of the family\nworked hard all day in the fields, they ate heavily of\ncoarse, greasy food, and at night slept like tired\nbeasts on beds of straw. Into their lives came little\nthat was not coarse and brutal and outwardly they were\nthemselves coarse and brutal. On Saturday afternoons\nthey hitched a team of horses to a three-seated wagon\nand went off to town. In town they stood about the\nstoves in the stores talking to other farmers or to the\nstore keepers. They were dressed in overalls and in the\nwinter wore heavy coats that were flecked with mud.\nTheir hands as they stretched them out to the heat of\nthe stoves were cracked and red. It was difficult for\nthem to talk and so they for the most part kept silent.\nWhen they had bought meat, flour, sugar, and salt, they\nwent into one of the Winesburg saloons and drank beer.\nUnder the influence of drink the naturally strong lusts\nof their natures, kept suppressed by the heroic labor\nof breaking up new ground, were released. A kind of\ncrude and animal-like poetic fervor took possession of\nthem. On the road home they stood up on the wagon seats\nand shouted at the stars. Sometimes they fought long\nand bitterly and at other times they broke forth into\nsongs. Once Enoch Bentley, the older one of the boys,\nstruck his father, old Tom Bentley, with the butt of a\nteamster's whip, and the old man seemed likely to die.\nFor days Enoch lay hid in the straw in the loft of the\nstable ready to flee if the result of his momentary\npassion turned out to be murder. He was kept alive with\nfood brought by his mother, who also kept him informed\nof the injured man's condition. When all turned out\nwell he emerged from his hiding place and went back to\nthe work of clearing land as though nothing had\nhappened.\n\n            *       *       *\n\nThe Civil War brought a sharp turn to the fortunes of\nthe Bentleys and was responsible for the rise of the\nyoungest son, Jesse. Enoch, Edward, Harry, and Will\nBentley all enlisted and before the long war ended they\nwere all killed. For a time after they went away to the\nSouth, old Tom tried to run the place, but he was not\nsuccessful. When the last of the four had been killed\nhe sent word to Jesse that he would have to come home.\n\nThen the mother, who had not been well for a year, died\nsuddenly, and the father became altogether discouraged.\nHe talked of selling the farm and moving into town. All\nday he went about shaking his head and muttering. The\nwork in the fields was neglected and weeds grew high in\nthe corn. Old Tom hired men but he did not use them\nintelligently. When they had gone away to the fields in\nthe morning he wandered into the woods and sat down on\na log. Sometimes he forgot to come home at night and\none of the daughters had to go in search of him.\n\nWhen Jesse Bentley came home to the farm and began to\ntake charge of things he was a slight,\nsensitive-looking man of twenty-two. At eighteen he\nhad left home to go to school to become a scholar and\neventually to become a minister of the Presbyterian\nChurch. All through his boyhood he had been what in our\ncountry was called an \"odd sheep\" and had not got on\nwith his brothers. Of all the family only his mother\nhad understood him and she was now dead. When he came\nhome to take charge of the farm, that had at that time\ngrown to more than six hundred acres, everyone on the\nfarms about and in the nearby town of Winesburg smiled\nat the idea of his trying to handle the work that had\nbeen done by his four strong brothers.\n\nThere was indeed good cause to smile. By the standards\nof his day Jesse did not look like a man at all. He was\nsmall and very slender and womanish of body and, true\nto the traditions of young ministers, wore a long black\ncoat and a narrow black string tie. The neighbors were\namused when they saw him, after the years away, and\nthey were even more amused when they saw the woman he\nhad married in the city.\n\nAs a matter of fact, Jesse's wife did soon go under.\nThat was perhaps Jesse's fault. A farm in Northern Ohio\nin the hard years after the Civil War was no place for\na delicate woman, and Katherine Bentley was delicate.\nJesse was hard with her as he was with everybody about\nhim in those days. She tried to do such work as all the\nneighbor women about her did and he let her go on\nwithout interference. She helped to do the milking and\ndid part of the housework; she made the beds for the\nmen and prepared their food. For a year she worked\nevery day from sunrise until late at night and then\nafter giving birth to a child she died.\n\nAs for Jesse Bentley--although he was a delicately\nbuilt man there was something within him that could not\neasily be killed. He had brown curly hair and grey eyes\nthat were at times hard and direct, at times wavering\nand uncertain. Not only was he slender but he was also\nshort of stature. His mouth was like the mouth of a\nsensitive and very determined child. Jesse Bentley was\na fanatic. He was a man born out of his time and place\nand for this he suffered and made others suffer. Never\ndid he succeed in getting what he wanted out of life\nand he did not know what he wanted. Within a very short\ntime after he came home to the Bentley farm he made\neveryone there a little afraid of him, and his wife,\nwho should have been close to him as his mother had\nbeen, was afraid also. At the end of two weeks after\nhis coming, old Tom Bentley made over to him the entire\nownership of the place and retired into the background.\nEveryone retired into the background. In spite of his\nyouth and inexperience, Jesse had the trick of\nmastering the souls of his people. He was so in earnest\nin everything he did and said that no one understood\nhim. He made everyone on the farm work as they had\nnever worked before and yet there was no joy in the\nwork. If things went well they went well for Jesse and\nnever for the people who were his dependents. Like a\nthousand other strong men who have come into the world\nhere in America in these later times, Jesse was but\nhalf strong. He could master others but he could not\nmaster himself. The running of the farm as it had never\nbeen run before was easy for him. When he came home\nfrom Cleveland where he had been in school, he shut\nhimself off from all of his people and began to make\nplans. He thought about the farm night and day and that\nmade him successful. Other men on the farms about him\nworked too hard and were too fired to think, but to\nthink of the farm and to be everlastingly making plans\nfor its success was a relief to Jesse. It partially\nsatisfied something in his passionate nature.\nImmediately after he came home he had a wing built on\nto the old house and in a large room facing the west he\nhad windows that looked into the barnyard and other\nwindows that looked off across the fields. By the\nwindow he sat down to think. Hour after hour and day\nafter day he sat and looked over the land and thought\nout his new place in life. The passionate burning thing\nin his nature flamed up and his eyes became hard. He\nwanted to make the farm produce as no farm in his state\nhad ever produced before and then he wanted something\nelse. It was the indefinable hunger within that made\nhis eyes waver and that kept him always more and more\nsilent before people. He would have given much to\nachieve peace and in him was a fear that peace was the\nthing he could not achieve.\n\nAll over his body Jesse Bentley was alive. In his\nsmall frame was gathered the force of a long line of\nstrong men. He had always been extraordinarily alive\nwhen he was a small boy on the farm and later when he\nwas a young man in school. In the school he had studied\nand thought of God and the Bible with his whole mind\nand heart. As time passed and he grew to know people\nbetter, he began to think of himself as an\nextraordinary man, one set apart from his fellows. He\nwanted terribly to make his life a thing of great\nimportance, and as he looked about at his fellow men\nand saw how like clods they lived it seemed to him that\nhe could not bear to become also such a clod. Although\nin his absorption in himself and in his own destiny he\nwas blind to the fact that his young wife was doing a\nstrong woman's work even after she had become large\nwith child and that she was killing herself in his\nservice, he did not intend to be unkind to her. When\nhis father, who was old and twisted with toil, made\nover to him the ownership of the farm and seemed\ncontent to creep away to a corner and wait for death,\nhe shrugged his shoulders and dismissed the old man\nfrom his mind.\n\nIn the room by the window overlooking the land that had\ncome down to him sat Jesse thinking of his own affairs.\nIn the stables he could hear the tramping of his horses\nand the restless movement of his cattle. Away in the\nfields he could see other cattle wandering over green\nhills. The voices of men, his men who worked for him,\ncame in to him through the window. From the milkhouse\nthere was the steady thump, thump of a churn being\nmanipulated by the half-witted girl, Eliza Stoughton.\nJesse's mind went back to the men of Old Testament days\nwho had also owned lands and herds. He remembered how\nGod had come down out of the skies and talked to these\nmen and he wanted God to notice and to talk to him\nalso. A kind of feverish boyish eagerness to in some\nway achieve in his own life the flavor of significance\nthat had hung over these men took possession of him.\nBeing a prayerful man he spoke of the matter aloud to\nGod and the sound of his own words strengthened and fed\nhis eagerness.\n\n\"I am a new kind of man come into possession of these\nfields,\" he declared. \"Look upon me, O God, and look\nThou also upon my neighbors and all the men who have\ngone before me here! O God, create in me another Jesse,\nlike that one of old, to rule over men and to be the\nfather of sons who shall be rulers!\" Jesse grew excited\nas he talked aloud and jumping to his feet walked up\nand down in the room. In fancy he saw himself living in\nold times and among old peoples. The land that lay\nstretched out before him became of vast significance, a\nplace peopled by his fancy with a new race of men\nsprung from himself. It seemed to him that in his day\nas in those other and older days, kingdoms might be\ncreated and new impulses given to the lives of men by\nthe power of God speaking through a chosen servant. He\nlonged to be such a servant. \"It is God's work I have\ncome to the land to do,\" he declared in a loud voice\nand his short figure straightened and he thought that\nsomething like a halo of Godly approval hung over him.\n\n            *       *       *\n\nIt will perhaps be somewhat difficult for the men and\nwomen of a later day to understand Jesse Bentley. In\nthe last fifty years a vast change has taken place in\nthe lives of our people. A revolution has in fact taken\nplace. The coming of industrialism, attended by all the\nroar and rattle of affairs, the shrill cries of\nmillions of new voices that have come among us from\noverseas, the going and coming of trains, the growth of\ncities, the building of the inter-urban car lines that\nweave in and out of towns and past farmhouses, and now\nin these later days the coming of the automobiles has\nworked a tremendous change in the lives and in the\nhabits of thought of our people of Mid-America. Books,\nbadly imagined and written though they may be in the\nhurry of our times, are in every household, magazines\ncirculate by the millions of copies, newspapers are\neverywhere. In our day a farmer standing by the stove\nin the store in his village has his mind filled to\noverflowing with the words of other men. The newspapers\nand the magazines have pumped him full. Much of the old\nbrutal ignorance that had in it also a kind of\nbeautiful childlike innocence is gone forever. The\nfarmer by the stove is brother to the men of the\ncities, and if you listen you will find him talking as\nglibly and as senselessly as the best city man of us\nall.\n\nIn Jesse Bentley's time and in the country districts of\nthe whole Middle West in the years after the Civil War\nit was not so. Men labored too hard and were too tired\nto read. In them was no desire for words printed upon\npaper. As they worked in the fields, vague, half-formed\nthoughts took possession of them. They believed in God\nand in God's power to control their lives. In the\nlittle Protestant churches they gathered on Sunday to\nhear of God and his works. The churches were the center\nof the social and intellectual life of the times. The\nfigure of God was big in the hearts of men.\n\nAnd so, having been born an imaginative child and\nhaving within him a great intellectual eagerness, Jesse\nBentley had turned wholeheartedly toward God. When the\nwar took his brothers away, he saw the hand of God in\nthat. When his father became ill and could no longer\nattend to the running of the farm, he took that also as\na sign from God. In the city, when the word came to\nhim, he walked about at night through the streets\nthinking of the matter and when he had come home and\nhad got the work on the farm well under way, he went\nagain at night to walk through the forests and over the\nlow hills and to think of God.\n\nAs he walked the importance of his own figure in some\ndivine plan grew in his mind. He grew avaricious and\nwas impatient that the farm contained only six hundred\nacres. Kneeling in a fence corner at the edge of some\nmeadow, he sent his voice abroad into the silence and\nlooking up he saw the stars shining down at him.\n\nOne evening, some months after his father's death, and\nwhen his wife Katherine was expecting at any moment to\nbe laid abed of childbirth, Jesse left his house and\nwent for a long walk. The Bentley farm was situated in\na tiny valley watered by Wine Creek, and Jesse walked\nalong the banks of the stream to the end of his own\nland and on through the fields of his neighbors. As he\nwalked the valley broadened and then narrowed again.\nGreat open stretches of field and wood lay before him.\nThe moon came out from behind clouds, and, climbing a\nlow hill, he sat down to think.\n\nJesse thought that as the true servant of God the\nentire stretch of country through which he had walked\nshould have come into his possession. He thought of his\ndead brothers and blamed them that they had not worked\nharder and achieved more. Before him in the moonlight\nthe tiny stream ran down over stones, and he began to\nthink of the men of old times who like himself had\nowned flocks and lands.\n\nA fantastic impulse, half fear, half greediness, took\npossession of Jesse Bentley. He remembered how in the\nold Bible story the Lord had appeared to that other\nJesse and told him to send his son David to where Saul\nand the men of Israel were fighting the Philistines in\nthe Valley of Elah. Into Jesse's mind came the\nconviction that all of the Ohio farmers who owned land\nin the valley of Wine Creek were Philistines and\nenemies of God. \"Suppose,\" he whispered to himself,\n\"there should come from among them one who, like\nGoliath the Philistine of Gath, could defeat me and\ntake from me my possessions.\" In fancy he felt the\nsickening dread that he thought must have lain heavy on\nthe heart of Saul before the coming of David. Jumping\nto his feet, he began to run through the night. As he\nran he called to God. His voice carried far over the\nlow hills. \"Jehovah of Hosts,\" he cried, \"send to me\nthis night out of the womb of Katherine, a son. Let Thy\ngrace alight upon me. Send me a son to be called David\nwho shall help me to pluck at last all of these lands\nout of the hands of the Philistines and turn them to\nThy service and to the building of Thy kingdom on\nearth.\"\n\n\n\nII\n\nDavid Hardy of Winesburg, Ohio, was the grandson of\nJesse Bentley, the owner of Bentley farms. When he was\ntwelve years old he went to the old Bentley place to\nlive. His mother, Louise Bentley, the girl who came\ninto the world on that night when Jesse ran through the\nfields crying to God that he be given a son, had grown\nto womanhood on the farm and had married young John\nHardy of Winesburg, who became a banker. Louise and her\nhusband did not live happily together and everyone\nagreed that she was to blame. She was a small woman\nwith sharp grey eyes and black hair. From childhood she\nhad been inclined to fits of temper and when not angry\nshe was often morose and silent. In Winesburg it was\nsaid that she drank. Her husband, the banker, who was a\ncareful, shrewd man, tried hard to make her happy. When\nhe began to make money he bought for her a large brick\nhouse on Elm Street in Winesburg and he was the first\nman in that town to keep a manservant to drive his\nwife's carriage.\n\nBut Louise could not be made happy. She flew into half\ninsane fits of temper during which she was sometimes\nsilent, sometimes noisy and quarrelsome. She swore and\ncried out in her anger. She got a knife from the\nkitchen and threatened her husband's life. Once she\ndeliberately set fire to the house, and often she hid\nherself away for days in her own room and would see no\none. Her life, lived as a half recluse, gave rise to\nall sorts of stories concerning her. It was said that\nshe took drugs and that she hid herself away from\npeople because she was often so under the influence of\ndrink that her condition could not be concealed.\nSometimes on summer afternoons she came out of the\nhouse and got into her carriage. Dismissing the driver\nshe took the reins in her own hands and drove off at\ntop speed through the streets. If a pedestrian got in\nher way she drove straight ahead and the frightened\ncitizen had to escape as best he could. To the people\nof the town it seemed as though she wanted to run them\ndown. When she had driven through several streets,\ntearing around corners and beating the horses with the\nwhip, she drove off into the country. On the country\nroads after she had gotten out of sight of the houses\nshe let the horses slow down to a walk and her wild,\nreckless mood passed. She became thoughtful and\nmuttered words. Sometimes tears came into her eyes. And\nthen when she came back into town she again drove\nfuriously through the quiet streets. But for the\ninfluence of her husband and the respect he inspired in\npeople's minds she would have been arrested more than\nonce by the town marshal.\n\nYoung David Hardy grew up in the house with this woman\nand as can well be imagined there was not much joy in\nhis childhood. He was too young then to have opinions\nof his own about people, but at times it was difficult\nfor him not to have very definite opinions about the\nwoman who was his mother. David was always a quiet,\norderly boy and for a long time was thought by the\npeople of Winesburg to be something of a dullard. His\neyes were brown and as a child he had a habit of\nlooking at things and people a long time without\nappearing to see what he was looking at. When he heard\nhis mother spoken of harshly or when he overheard her\nberating his father, he was frightened and ran away to\nhide. Sometimes he could not find a hiding place and\nthat confused him. Turning his face toward a tree or if\nhe was indoors toward the wall, he closed his eyes and\ntried not to think of anything. He had a habit of\ntalking aloud to himself, and early in life a spirit of\nquiet sadness often took possession of him.\n\nOn the occasions when David went to visit his\ngrandfather on the Bentley farm, he was altogether\ncontented and happy. Often he wished that he would\nnever have to go back to town and once when he had come\nhome from the farm after a long visit, something\nhappened that had a lasting effect on his mind.\n\nDavid had come back into town with one of the hired\nmen. The man was in a hurry to go about his own affairs\nand left the boy at the head of the street in which the\nHardy house stood. It was early dusk of a fall evening\nand the sky was overcast with clouds. Something\nhappened to David. He could not bear to go into the\nhouse where his mother and father lived, and on an\nimpulse he decided to run away from home. He intended\nto go back to the farm and to his grandfather, but lost\nhis way and for hours he wandered weeping and\nfrightened on country roads. It started to rain and\nlightning flashed in the sky. The boy's imagination was\nexcited and he fancied that he could see and hear\nstrange things in the darkness. Into his mind came the\nconviction that he was walking and running in some\nterrible void where no one had ever been before. The\ndarkness about him seemed limitless. The sound of the\nwind blowing in trees was terrifying. When a team of\nhorses approached along the road in which he walked he\nwas frightened and climbed a fence. Through a field he\nran until he came into another road and getting upon\nhis knees felt of the soft ground with his fingers. But\nfor the figure of his grandfather, whom he was afraid\nhe would never find in the darkness, he thought the\nworld must be altogether empty. When his cries were\nheard by a farmer who was walking home from town and he\nwas brought back to his father's house, he was so tired\nand excited that he did not know what was happening to\nhim.\n\nBy chance David's father knew that he had disappeared.\nOn the street he had met the farm hand from the Bentley\nplace and knew of his son's return to town. When the\nboy did not come home an alarm was set up and John\nHardy with several men of the town went to search the\ncountry. The report that David had been kidnapped ran\nabout through the streets of Winesburg. When he came\nhome there were no lights in the house, but his mother\nappeared and clutched him eagerly in her arms. David\nthought she had suddenly become another woman. He could\nnot believe that so delightful a thing had happened.\nWith her own hands Louise Hardy bathed his tired young\nbody and cooked him food. She would not let him go to\nbed but, when he had put on his nightgown, blew out the\nlights and sat down in a chair to hold him in her arms.\nFor an hour the woman sat in the darkness and held her\nboy. All the time she kept talking in a low voice.\nDavid could not understand what had so changed her. Her\nhabitually dissatisfied face had become, he thought,\nthe most peaceful and lovely thing he had ever seen.\nWhen he began to weep she held him more and more\ntightly. On and on went her voice. It was not harsh or\nshrill as when she talked to her husband, but was like\nrain falling on trees. Presently men began coming to\nthe door to report that he had not been found, but she\nmade him hide and be silent until she had sent them\naway. He thought it must be a game his mother and the\nmen of the town were playing with him and laughed\njoyously. Into his mind came the thought that his\nhaving been lost and frightened in the darkness was an\naltogether unimportant matter. He thought that he would\nhave been willing to go through the frightful\nexperience a thousand times to be sure of finding at\nthe end of the long black road a thing so lovely as his\nmother had suddenly become.\n\n            *       *       *\n\nDuring the last years of young David's boyhood he saw\nhis mother but seldom and she became for him just a\nwoman with whom he had once lived. Still he could not\nget her figure out of his mind and as he grew older it\nbecame more definite. When he was twelve years old he\nwent to the Bentley farm to live. Old Jesse came into\ntown and fairly demanded that he be given charge of the\nboy. The old man was excited and determined on having\nhis own way. He talked to John Hardy in the office of\nthe Winesburg Savings Bank and then the two men went to\nthe house on Elm Street to talk with Louise. They both\nexpected her to make trouble but were mistaken. She was\nvery quiet and when Jesse had explained his mission and\nhad gone on at some length about the advantages to come\nthrough having the boy out of doors and in the quiet\natmosphere of the old farmhouse, she nodded her head in\napproval. \"It is an atmosphere not corrupted by my\npresence,\" she said sharply. Her shoulders shook and\nshe seemed about to fly into a fit of temper. \"It is a\nplace for a man child, although it was never a place\nfor me,\" she went on. \"You never wanted me there and of\ncourse the air of your house did me no good. It was\nlike poison in my blood but it will be different with\nhim.\"\n\nLouise turned and went out of the room, leaving the two\nmen to sit in embarrassed silence. As very often\nhappened she later stayed in her room for days. Even\nwhen the boy's clothes were packed and he was taken\naway she did not appear. The loss of her son made a\nsharp break in her life and she seemed less inclined to\nquarrel with her husband. John Hardy thought it had all\nturned out very well indeed.\n\nAnd so young David went to live in the Bentley\nfarmhouse with Jesse. Two of the old farmer's sisters\nwere alive and still lived in the house. They were\nafraid of Jesse and rarely spoke when he was about. One\nof the women who had been noted for her flaming red\nhair when she was younger was a born mother and became\nthe boy's caretaker. Every night when he had gone to\nbed she went into his room and sat on the floor until\nhe fell asleep. When he became drowsy she became bold\nand whispered things that he later thought he must have\ndreamed.\n\nHer soft low voice called him endearing names and he\ndreamed that his mother had come to him and that she\nhad changed so that she was always as she had been that\ntime after he ran away. He also grew bold and reaching\nout his hand stroked the face of the woman on the floor\nso that she was ecstatically happy. Everyone in the old\nhouse became happy after the boy went there. The hard\ninsistent thing in Jesse Bentley that had kept the\npeople in the house silent and timid and that had never\nbeen dispelled by the presence of the girl Louise was\napparently swept away by the coming of the boy. It was\nas though God had relented and sent a son to the man.\n\nThe man who had proclaimed himself the only true\nservant of God in all the valley of Wine Creek, and who\nhad wanted God to send him a sign of approval by way of\na son out of the womb of Katherine, began to think that\nat last his prayers had been answered. Although he was\nat that time only fifty-five years old he looked\nseventy and was worn out with much thinking and\nscheming. The effort he had made to extend his land\nholdings had been successful and there were few farms\nin the valley that did not belong to him, but until\nDavid came he was a bitterly disappointed man.\n\nThere were two influences at work in Jesse Bentley and\nall his life his mind had been a battleground for these\ninfluences. First there was the old thing in him. He\nwanted to be a man of God and a leader among men of\nGod. His walking in the fields and through the forests\nat night had brought him close to nature and there were\nforces in the passionately religious man that ran out\nto the forces in nature. The disappointment that had\ncome to him when a daughter and not a son had been born\nto Katherine had fallen upon him like a blow struck by\nsome unseen hand and the blow had somewhat softened his\negotism. He still believed that God might at any moment\nmake himself manifest out of the winds or the clouds,\nbut he no longer demanded such recognition. Instead he\nprayed for it. Sometimes he was altogether doubtful and\nthought God had deserted the world. He regretted the\nfate that had not let him live in a simpler and sweeter\ntime when at the beckoning of some strange cloud in the\nsky men left their lands and houses and went forth into\nthe wilderness to create new races. While he worked\nnight and day to make his farms more productive and to\nextend his holdings of land, he regretted that he could\nnot use his own restless energy in the building of\ntemples, the slaying of unbelievers and in general in\nthe work of glorifying God's name on earth.\n\nThat is what Jesse hungered for and then also he\nhungered for something else. He had grown into maturity\nin America in the years after the Civil War and he,\nlike all men of his time, had been touched by the deep\ninfluences that were at work in the country during\nthose years when modern industrialism was being born.\nHe began to buy machines that would permit him to do\nthe work of the farms while employing fewer men and he\nsometimes thought that if he were a younger man he\nwould give up farming altogether and start a factory in\nWinesburg for the making of machinery. Jesse formed the\nhabit of reading newspapers and magazines. He invented\na machine for the making of fence out of wire. Faintly\nhe realized that the atmosphere of old times and places\nthat he had always cultivated in his own mind was\nstrange and foreign to the thing that was growing up in\nthe minds of others. The beginning of the most\nmaterialistic age in the history of the world, when\nwars would be fought without patriotism, when men would\nforget God and only pay attention to moral standards,\nwhen the will to power would replace the will to serve\nand beauty would be well-nigh forgotten in the terrible\nheadlong rush of mankind toward the acquiring of\npossessions, was telling its story to Jesse the man of\nGod as it was to the men about him. The greedy thing in\nhim wanted to make money faster than it could be made\nby tilling the land. More than once he went into\nWinesburg to talk with his son-in-law John Hardy about\nit. \"You are a banker and you will have chances I never\nhad,\" he said and his eyes shone. \"I am thinking about\nit all the time. Big things are going to be done in the\ncountry and there will be more money to be made than I\never dreamed of. You get into it. I wish I were younger\nand had your chance.\" Jesse Bentley walked up and down\nin the bank office and grew more and more excited as he\ntalked. At one time in his life he had been threatened\nwith paralysis and his left side remained somewhat\nweakened. As he talked his left eyelid twitched. Later\nwhen he drove back home and when night came on and the\nstars came out it was harder to get back the old\nfeeling of a close and personal God who lived in the\nsky overhead and who might at any moment reach out his\nhand, touch him on the shoulder, and appoint for him\nsome heroic task to be done. Jesse's mind was fixed\nupon the things read in newspapers and magazines, on\nfortunes to be made almost without effort by shrewd men\nwho bought and sold. For him the coming of the boy\nDavid did much to bring back with renewed force the old\nfaith and it seemed to him that God had at last looked\nwith favor upon him.\n\nAs for the boy on the farm, life began to reveal itself\nto him in a thousand new and delightful ways. The\nkindly attitude of all about him expanded his quiet\nnature and he lost the half timid, hesitating manner he\nhad always had with his people. At night when he went\nto bed after a long day of adventures in the stables,\nin the fields, or driving about from farm to farm with\nhis grandfather, he wanted to embrace everyone in the\nhouse. If Sherley Bentley, the woman who came each\nnight to sit on the floor by his bedside, did not\nappear at once, he went to the head of the stairs and\nshouted, his young voice ringing through the narrow\nhalls where for so long there had been a tradition of\nsilence. In the morning when he awoke and lay still in\nbed, the sounds that came in to him through the windows\nfilled him with delight. He thought with a shudder of\nthe life in the house in Winesburg and of his mother's\nangry voice that had always made him tremble. There in\nthe country all sounds were pleasant sounds. When he\nawoke at dawn the barnyard back of the house also\nawoke. In the house people stirred about. Eliza\nStoughton the half-witted girl was poked in the ribs by\na farm hand and giggled noisily, in some distant field\na cow bawled and was answered by the cattle in the\nstables, and one of the farm hands spoke sharply to the\nhorse he was grooming by the stable door. David leaped\nout of bed and ran to a window. All of the people\nstirring about excited his mind, and he wondered what\nhis mother was doing in the house in town.\n\nFrom the windows of his own room he could not see\ndirectly into the barnyard where the farm hands had now\nall assembled to do the morning shores, but he could\nhear the voices of the men and the neighing of the\nhorses. When one of the men laughed, he laughed also.\nLeaning out at the open window, he looked into an\norchard where a fat sow wandered about with a litter of\ntiny pigs at her heels. Every morning he counted the\npigs. \"Four, five, six, seven,\" he said slowly, wetting\nhis finger and making straight up and down marks on the\nwindow ledge. David ran to put on his trousers and\nshirt. A feverish desire to get out of doors took\npossession of him. Every morning he made such a noise\ncoming down stairs that Aunt Callie, the housekeeper,\ndeclared he was trying to tear the house down. When he\nhad run through the long old house, shutting the doors\nbehind him with a bang, he came into the barnyard and\nlooked about with an amazed air of expectancy. It\nseemed to him that in such a place tremendous things\nmight have happened during the night. The farm hands\nlooked at him and laughed. Henry Strader, an old man\nwho had been on the farm since Jesse came into\npossession and who before David's time had never been\nknown to make a joke, made the same joke every morning.\nIt amused David so that he laughed and clapped his\nhands. \"See, come here and look,\" cried the old man.\n\"Grandfather Jesse's white mare has torn the black\nstocking she wears on her foot.\"\n\nDay after day through the long summer, Jesse Bentley\ndrove from farm to farm up and down the valley of Wine\nCreek, and his grandson went with him. They rode in a\ncomfortable old phaeton drawn by the white horse. The\nold man scratched his thin white beard and talked to\nhimself of his plans for increasing the productiveness\nof the fields they visited and of God's part in the\nplans all men made. Sometimes he looked at David and\nsmiled happily and then for a long time he appeared to\nforget the boy's existence. More and more every day now\nhis mind turned back again to the dreams that had\nfilled his mind when he had first come out of the city\nto live on the land. One afternoon he startled David by\nletting his dreams take entire possession of him. With\nthe boy as a witness, he went through a ceremony and\nbrought about an accident that nearly destroyed the\ncompanionship that was growing up between them.\n\nJesse and his grandson were driving in a distant part\nof the valley some miles from home. A forest came down\nto the road and through the forest Wine Creek wriggled\nits way over stones toward a distant river. All the\nafternoon Jesse had been in a meditative mood and now\nhe began to talk. His mind went back to the night when\nhe had been frightened by thoughts of a giant that\nmight come to rob and plunder him of his possessions,\nand again as on that night when he had run through the\nfields crying for a son, he became excited to the edge\nof insanity. Stopping the horse he got out of the buggy\nand asked David to get out also. The two climbed over a\nfence and walked along the bank of the stream. The boy\npaid no attention to the muttering of his grandfather,\nbut ran along beside him and wondered what was going to\nhappen. When a rabbit jumped up and ran away through\nthe woods, he clapped his hands and danced with\ndelight. He looked at the tall trees and was sorry that\nhe was not a little animal to climb high in the air\nwithout being frightened. Stooping, he picked up a\nsmall stone and threw it over the head of his\ngrandfather into a clump of bushes. \"Wake up, little\nanimal. Go and climb to the top of the trees,\" he\nshouted in a shrill voice.\n\nJesse Bentley went along under the trees with his head\nbowed and with his mind in a ferment. His earnestness\naffected the boy, who presently became silent and a\nlittle alarmed. Into the old man's mind had come the\nnotion that now he could bring from God a word or a\nsign out of the sky, that the presence of the boy and\nman on their knees in some lonely spot in the forest\nwould make the miracle he had been waiting for almost\ninevitable. \"It was in just such a place as this that\nother David tended the sheep when his father came and\ntold him to go down unto Saul,\" he muttered.\n\nTaking the boy rather roughly by the shoulder, he\nclimbed over a fallen log and when he had come to an\nopen place among the trees he dropped upon his knees\nand began to pray in a loud voice.\n\nA kind of terror he had never known before took\npossession of David. Crouching beneath a tree he\nwatched the man on the ground before him and his own\nknees began to tremble. It seemed to him that he was in\nthe presence not only of his grandfather but of someone\nelse, someone who might hurt him, someone who was not\nkindly but dangerous and brutal. He began to cry and\nreaching down picked up a small stick, which he held\ntightly gripped in his fingers. When Jesse Bentley,\nabsorbed in his own idea, suddenly arose and advanced\ntoward him, his terror grew until his whole body shook.\nIn the woods an intense silence seemed to lie over\neverything and suddenly out of the silence came the old\nman's harsh and insistent voice. Gripping the boy's\nshoulders, Jesse turned his face to the sky and\nshouted. The whole left side of his face twitched and\nhis hand on the boy's shoulder twitched also. \"Make a\nsign to me, God,\" he cried. \"Here I stand with the boy\nDavid. Come down to me out of the sky and make Thy\npresence known to me.\"\n\nWith a cry of fear, David turned and, shaking himself\nloose from the hands that held him, ran away through\nthe forest. He did not believe that the man who turned\nup his face and in a harsh voice shouted at the sky was\nhis grandfather at all. The man did not look like his\ngrandfather. The conviction that something strange and\nterrible had happened, that by some miracle a new and\ndangerous person had come into the body of the kindly\nold man, took possession of him. On and on he ran down\nthe hillside, sobbing as he ran. When he fell over the\nroots of a tree and in falling struck his head, he\narose and tried to run on again. His head hurt so that\npresently he fell down and lay still, but it was only\nafter Jesse had carried him to the buggy and he awoke\nto find the old man's hand stroking his head tenderly\nthat the terror left him. \"Take me away. There is a\nterrible man back there in the woods,\" he declared\nfirmly, while Jesse looked away over the tops of the\ntrees and again his lips cried out to God. \"What have I\ndone that Thou dost not approve of me,\" he whispered\nsoftly, saying the words over and over as he drove\nrapidly along the road with the boy's cut and bleeding\nhead held tenderly against his shoulder.\n\n\nIII\n\nSurrender\n\nThe story of Louise Bentley, who became Mrs. John Hardy\nand lived with her husband in a brick house on Elm\nStreet in Winesburg, is a story of misunderstanding.\n\nBefore such women as Louise can be understood and their\nlives made livable, much will have to be done.\nThoughtful books will have to be written and thoughtful\nlives lived by people about them.\n\nBorn of a delicate and overworked mother, and an\nimpulsive, hard, imaginative father, who did not look\nwith favor upon her coming into the world, Louise was\nfrom childhood a neurotic, one of the race of\nover-sensitive women that in later days industrialism\nwas to bring in such great numbers into the world.\n\nDuring her early years she lived on the Bentley farm, a\nsilent, moody child, wanting love more than anything\nelse in the world and not getting it. When she was\nfifteen she went to live in Winesburg with the family\nof Albert Hardy, who had a store for the sale of\nbuggies and wagons, and who was a member of the town\nboard of education.\n\nLouise went into town to be a student in the Winesburg\nHigh School and she went to live at the Hardys' because\nAlbert Hardy and her father were friends.\n\nHardy, the vehicle merchant of Winesburg, like\nthousands of other men of his times, was an enthusiast\non the subject of education. He had made his own way in\nthe world without learning got from books, but he was\nconvinced that had he but known books things would have\ngone better with him. To everyone who came into his\nshop he talked of the matter, and in his own household\nhe drove his family distracted by his constant harping\non the subject.\n\nHe had two daughters and one son, John Hardy, and more\nthan once the daughters threatened to leave school\naltogether. As a matter of principle they did just\nenough work in their classes to avoid punishment. \"I\nhate books and I hate anyone who likes books,\" Harriet,\nthe younger of the two girls, declared passionately.\n\nIn Winesburg as on the farm Louise was not happy. For\nyears she had dreamed of the time when she could go\nforth into the world, and she looked upon the move into\nthe Hardy household as a great step in the direction of\nfreedom. Always when she had thought of the matter, it\nhad seemed to her that in town all must be gaiety and\nlife, that there men and women must live happily and\nfreely, giving and taking friendship and affection as\none takes the feel of a wind on the cheek. After the\nsilence and the cheerlessness of life in the Bentley\nhouse, she dreamed of stepping forth into an atmosphere\nthat was warm and pulsating with life and reality. And\nin the Hardy household Louise might have got something\nof the thing for which she so hungered but for a\nmistake she made when she had just come to town.\n\nLouise won the disfavor of the two Hardy girls, Mary\nand Harriet, by her application to her studies in\nschool. She did not come to the house until the day\nwhen school was to begin and knew nothing of the\nfeeling they had in the matter. She was timid and\nduring the first month made no acquaintances. Every\nFriday afternoon one of the hired men from the farm\ndrove into Winesburg and took her home for the\nweek-end, so that she did not spend the Saturday\nholiday with the town people. Because she was\nembarrassed and lonely she worked constantly at her\nstudies. To Mary and Harriet, it seemed as though she\ntried to make trouble for them by her proficiency. In\nher eagerness to appear well Louise wanted to answer\nevery question put to the class by the teacher. She\njumped up and down and her eyes flashed. Then when she\nhad answered some question the others in the class had\nbeen unable to answer, she smiled happily. \"See, I have\ndone it for you,\" her eyes seemed to say. \"You need not\nbother about the matter. I will answer all questions.\nFor the whole class it will be easy while I am here.\"\n\nIn the evening after supper in the Hardy house, Albert\nHardy began to praise Louise. One of the teachers had\nspoken highly of her and he was delighted. \"Well, again\nI have heard of it,\" he began, looking hard at his\ndaughters and then turning to smile at Louise. \"Another\nof the teachers has told me of the good work Louise is\ndoing. Everyone in Winesburg is telling me how smart\nshe is. I am ashamed that they do not speak so of my\nown girls.\" Arising, the merchant marched about the\nroom and lighted his evening cigar.\n\nThe two girls looked at each other and shook their\nheads wearily. Seeing their indifference the father\nbecame angry. \"I tell you it is something for you two\nto be thinking about,\" he cried, glaring at them.\n\"There is a big change coming here in America and in\nlearning is the only hope of the coming generations.\nLouise is the daughter of a rich man but she is not\nashamed to study. It should make you ashamed to see\nwhat she does.\"\n\nThe merchant took his hat from a rack by the door and\nprepared to depart for the evening. At the door he\nstopped and glared back. So fierce was his manner that\nLouise was frightened and ran upstairs to her own room.\nThe daughters began to speak of their own affairs. \"Pay\nattention to me,\" roared the merchant. \"Your minds are\nlazy. Your indifference to education is affecting your\ncharacters. You will amount to nothing. Now mark what I\nsay--Louise will be so far ahead of you that you will\nnever catch up.\"\n\nThe distracted man went out of the house and into the\nstreet shaking with wrath. He went along muttering\nwords and swearing, but when he got into Main Street\nhis anger passed. He stopped to talk of the weather or\nthe crops with some other merchant or with a farmer who\nhad come into town and forgot his daughters altogether\nor, if he thought of them, only shrugged his shoulders.\n\"Oh, well, girls will be girls,\" he muttered\nphilosophically.\n\nIn the house when Louise came down into the room where\nthe two girls sat, they would have nothing to do with\nher. One evening after she had been there for more than\nsix weeks and was heartbroken because of the continued\nair of coldness with which she was always greeted, she\nburst into tears. \"Shut up your crying and go back to\nyour own room and to your books,\" Mary Hardy said\nsharply.\n\n               *  *  *\n\nThe room occupied by Louise was on the second floor of\nthe Hardy house, and her window looked out upon an\norchard. There was a stove in the room and every\nevening young John Hardy carried up an armful of wood\nand put it in a box that stood by the wall. During the\nsecond month after she came to the house, Louise gave\nup all hope of getting on a friendly footing with the\nHardy girls and went to her own room as soon as the\nevening meal was at an end.\n\nHer mind began to play with thoughts of making friends\nwith John Hardy. When he came into the room with the\nwood in his arms, she pretended to be busy with her\nstudies but watched him eagerly. When he had put the\nwood in the box and turned to go out, she put down her\nhead and blushed. She tried to make talk but could say\nnothing, and after he had gone she was angry at herself\nfor her stupidity.\n\nThe mind of the country girl became filled with the\nidea of drawing close to the young man. She thought\nthat in him might be found the quality she had all her\nlife been seeking in people. It seemed to her that\nbetween herself and all the other people in the world,\na wall had been built up and that she was living just\non the edge of some warm inner circle of life that must\nbe quite open and understandable to others. She became\nobsessed with the thought that it wanted but a\ncourageous act on her part to make all of her\nassociation with people something quite different, and\nthat it was possible by such an act to pass into a new\nlife as one opens a door and goes into a room. Day and\nnight she thought of the matter, but although the thing\nshe wanted so earnestly was something very warm and\nclose it had as yet no conscious connection with sex.\nIt had not become that definite, and her mind had only\nalighted upon the person of John Hardy because he was\nat hand and unlike his sisters had not been unfriendly\nto her.\n\nThe Hardy sisters, Mary and Harriet, were both older\nthan Louise. In a certain kind of knowledge of the\nworld they were years older. They lived as all of the\nyoung women of Middle Western towns lived. In those\ndays young women did not go out of our towns to Eastern\ncolleges and ideas in regard to social classes had\nhardly begun to exist. A daughter of a laborer was in\nmuch the same social position as a daughter of a farmer\nor a merchant, and there were no leisure classes. A\ngirl was \"nice\" or she was \"not nice.\" If a nice girl,\nshe had a young man who came to her house to see her on\nSunday and on Wednesday evenings. Sometimes she went\nwith her young man to a dance or a church social. At\nother times she received him at the house and was given\nthe use of the parlor for that purpose. No one intruded\nupon her. For hours the two sat behind closed doors.\nSometimes the lights were turned low and the young man\nand woman embraced. Cheeks became hot and hair\ndisarranged. After a year or two, if the impulse within\nthem became strong and insistent enough, they married.\n\nOne evening during her first winter in Winesburg,\nLouise had an adventure that gave a new impulse to her\ndesire to break down the wall that she thought stood\nbetween her and John Hardy. It was Wednesday and\nimmediately after the evening meal Albert Hardy put on\nhis hat and went away. Young John brought the wood and\nput it in the box in Louise's room. \"You do work hard,\ndon't you?\" he said awkwardly, and then before she\ncould answer he also went away.\n\nLouise heard him go out of the house and had a mad\ndesire to run after him. Opening her window she leaned\nout and called softly, \"John, dear John, come back,\ndon't go away.\" The night was cloudy and she could not\nsee far into the darkness, but as she waited she\nfancied she could hear a soft little noise as of\nsomeone going on tiptoes through the trees in the\norchard. She was frightened and closed the window\nquickly. For an hour she moved about the room trembling\nwith excitement and when she could not longer bear the\nwaiting, she crept into the hall and down the stairs\ninto a closet-like room that opened off the parlor.\n\nLouise had decided that she would perform the\ncourageous act that had for weeks been in her mind. She\nwas convinced that John Hardy had concealed himself in\nthe orchard beneath her window and she was determined\nto find him and tell him that she wanted him to come\nclose to her, to hold her in his arms, to tell her of\nhis thoughts and dreams and to listen while she told\nhim her thoughts and dreams. \"In the darkness it will\nbe easier to say things,\" she whispered to herself, as\nshe stood in the little room groping for the door.\n\nAnd then suddenly Louise realized that she was not\nalone in the house. In the parlor on the other side of\nthe door a man's voice spoke softly and the door\nopened. Louise just had time to conceal herself in a\nlittle opening beneath the stairway when Mary Hardy,\naccompanied by her young man, came into the little dark\nroom.\n\nFor an hour Louise sat on the floor in the darkness and\nlistened. Without words Mary Hardy, with the aid of the\nman who had come to spend the evening with her, brought\nto the country girl a knowledge of men and women.\nPutting her head down until she was curled into a\nlittle ball she lay perfectly still. It seemed to her\nthat by some strange impulse of the gods, a great gift\nhad been brought to Mary Hardy and she could not\nunderstand the older woman's determined protest.\n\nThe young man took Mary Hardy into his arms and kissed\nher. When she struggled and laughed, he but held her\nthe more tightly. For an hour the contest between them\nwent on and then they went back into the parlor and\nLouise escaped up the stairs. \"I hope you were quiet\nout there. You must not disturb the little mouse at her\nstudies,\" she heard Harriet saying to her sister as she\nstood by her own door in the hallway above.\n\nLouise wrote a note to John Hardy and late that night,\nwhen all in the house were asleep, she crept downstairs\nand slipped it under his door. She was afraid that if\nshe did not do the thing at once her courage would\nfail. In the note she tried to be quite definite about\nwhat she wanted. \"I want someone to love me and I want\nto love someone,\" she wrote. \"If you are the one for me\nI want you to come into the orchard at night and make a\nnoise under my window. It will be easy for me to crawl\ndown over the shed and come to you. I am thinking about\nit all the time, so if you are to come at all you must\ncome soon.\"\n\nFor a long time Louise did not know what would be the\noutcome of her bold attempt to secure for herself a\nlover. In a way she still did not know whether or not\nshe wanted him to come. Sometimes it seemed to her that\nto be held tightly and kissed was the whole secret of\nlife, and then a new impulse came and she was terribly\nafraid. The age-old woman's desire to be possessed had\ntaken possession of her, but so vague was her notion of\nlife that it seemed to her just the touch of John\nHardy's hand upon her own hand would satisfy. She\nwondered if he would understand that. At the table next\nday while Albert Hardy talked and the two girls\nwhispered and laughed, she did not look at John but at\nthe table and as soon as possible escaped. In the\nevening she went out of the house until she was sure he\nhad taken the wood to her room and gone away. When\nafter several evenings of intense listening she heard\nno call from the darkness in the orchard, she was half\nbeside herself with grief and decided that for her\nthere was no way to break through the wall that had\nshut her off from the joy of life.\n\nAnd then on a Monday evening two or three weeks after\nthe writing of the note, John Hardy came for her.\nLouise had so entirely given up the thought of his\ncoming that for a long time she did not hear the call\nthat came up from the orchard. On the Friday evening\nbefore, as she was being driven back to the farm for\nthe week-end by one of the hired men, she had on an\nimpulse done a thing that had startled her, and as John\nHardy stood in the darkness below and called her name\nsoftly and insistently, she walked about in her room\nand wondered what new impulse had led her to commit so\nridiculous an act.\n\nThe farm hand, a young fellow with black curly hair,\nhad come for her somewhat late on that Friday evening\nand they drove home in the darkness. Louise, whose mind\nwas filled with thoughts of John Hardy, tried to make\ntalk but the country boy was embarrassed and would say\nnothing. Her mind began to review the loneliness of her\nchildhood and she remembered with a pang the sharp new\nloneliness that had just come to her. \"I hate\neveryone,\" she cried suddenly, and then broke forth\ninto a tirade that frightened her escort. \"I hate\nfather and the old man Hardy, too,\" she declared\nvehemently. \"I get my lessons there in the school in\ntown but I hate that also.\"\n\nLouise frightened the farm hand still more by turning\nand putting her cheek down upon his shoulder. Vaguely\nshe hoped that he like that young man who had stood in\nthe darkness with Mary would put his arms about her and\nkiss her, but the country boy was only alarmed. He\nstruck the horse with the whip and began to whistle.\n\"The road is rough, eh?\" he said loudly. Louise was so\nangry that reaching up she snatched his hat from his\nhead and threw it into the road. When he jumped out of\nthe buggy and went to get it, she drove off and left\nhim to walk the rest of the way back to the farm.\n\nLouise Bentley took John Hardy to be her lover. That\nwas not what she wanted but it was so the young man had\ninterpreted her approach to him, and so anxious was she\nto achieve something else that she made no resistance.\nWhen after a few months they were both afraid that she\nwas about to become a mother, they went one evening to\nthe county seat and were married. For a few months they\nlived in the Hardy house and then took a house of their\nown. All during the first year Louise tried to make her\nhusband understand the vague and intangible hunger that\nhad led to the writing of the note and that was still\nunsatisfied. Again and again she crept into his arms\nand tried to talk of it, but always without success.\nFilled with his own notions of love between men and\nwomen, he did not listen but began to kiss her upon the\nlips. That confused her so that in the end she did not\nwant to be kissed. She did not know what she wanted.\n\nWhen the alarm that had tricked them into marriage\nproved to be groundless, she was angry and said bitter,\nhurtful things. Later when her son David was born, she\ncould not nurse him and did not know whether she wanted\nhim or not. Sometimes she stayed in the room with him\nall day, walking about and occasionally creeping close\nto touch him tenderly with her hands, and then other\ndays came when she did not want to see or be near the\ntiny bit of humanity that had come into the house. When\nJohn Hardy reproached her for her cruelty, she laughed.\n\"It is a man child and will get what it wants anyway,\"\nshe said sharply. \"Had it been a woman child there is\nnothing in the world I would not have done for it.\"\n\n\n\nIV\n\nTerror\n\nWhen David Hardy was a tall boy of fifteen, he, like\nhis mother, had an adventure that changed the whole\ncurrent of his life and sent him out of his quiet\ncorner into the world. The shell of the circumstances\nof his life was broken and he was compelled to start\nforth. He left Winesburg and no one there ever saw him\nagain. After his disappearance, his mother and\ngrandfather both died and his father became very rich.\nHe spent much money in trying to locate his son, but\nthat is no part of this story.\n\nIt was in the late fall of an unusual year on the\nBentley farms. Everywhere the crops had been heavy.\nThat spring, Jesse had bought part of a long strip of\nblack swamp land that lay in the valley of Wine Creek.\nHe got the land at a low price but had spent a large\nsum of money to improve it. Great ditches had to be dug\nand thousands of tile laid. Neighboring farmers shook\ntheir heads over the expense. Some of them laughed and\nhoped that Jesse would lose heavily by the venture, but\nthe old man went silently on with the work and said\nnothing.\n\nWhen the land was drained he planted it to cabbages and\nonions, and again the neighbors laughed. The crop was,\nhowever, enormous and brought high prices. In the one\nyear Jesse made enough money to pay for all the cost of\npreparing the land and had a surplus that enabled him\nto buy two more farms. He was exultant and could not\nconceal his delight. For the first time in all the\nhistory of his ownership of the farms, he went among\nhis men with a smiling face.\n\nJesse bought a great many new machines for cutting down\nthe cost of labor and all of the remaining acres in the\nstrip of black fertile swamp land. One day he went into\nWinesburg and bought a bicycle and a new suit of\nclothes for David and he gave his two sisters money\nwith which to go to a religious convention at\nCleveland, Ohio.\n\nIn the fall of that year when the frost came and the\ntrees in the forests along Wine Creek were golden\nbrown, David spent every moment when he did not have to\nattend school, out in the open. Alone or with other\nboys he went every afternoon into the woods to gather\nnuts. The other boys of the countryside, most of them\nsons of laborers on the Bentley farms, had guns with\nwhich they went hunting rabbits and squirrels, but\nDavid did not go with them. He made himself a sling\nwith rubber bands and a forked stick and went off by\nhimself to gather nuts. As he went about thoughts came\nto him. He realized that he was almost a man and\nwondered what he would do in life, but before they came\nto anything, the thoughts passed and he was a boy\nagain. One day he killed a squirrel that sat on one of\nthe lower branches of a tree and chattered at him. Home\nhe ran with the squirrel in his hand. One of the\nBentley sisters cooked the little animal and he ate it\nwith great gusto. The skin he tacked on a board and\nsuspended the board by a string from his bedroom\nwindow.\n\nThat gave his mind a new turn. After that he never\nwent into the woods without carrying the sling in his\npocket and he spent hours shooting at imaginary animals\nconcealed among the brown leaves in the trees. Thoughts\nof his coming manhood passed and he was content to be a\nboy with a boy's impulses.\n\nOne Saturday morning when he was about to set off for\nthe woods with the sling in his pocket and a bag for\nnuts on his shoulder, his grandfather stopped him. In\nthe eyes of the old man was the strained serious look\nthat always a little frightened David. At such times\nJesse Bentley's eyes did not look straight ahead but\nwavered and seemed to be looking at nothing. Something\nlike an invisible curtain appeared to have come between\nthe man and all the rest of the world. \"I want you to\ncome with me,\" he said briefly, and his eyes looked\nover the boy's head into the sky. \"We have something\nimportant to do today. You may bring the bag for nuts\nif you wish. It does not matter and anyway we will be\ngoing into the woods.\"\n\nJesse and David set out from the Bentley farmhouse in\nthe old phaeton that was drawn by the white horse. When\nthey had gone along in silence for a long way they\nstopped at the edge of a field where a flock of sheep\nwere grazing. Among the sheep was a lamb that had been\nborn out of season, and this David and his grandfather\ncaught and tied so tightly that it looked like a little\nwhite ball. When they drove on again Jesse let David\nhold the lamb in his arms. \"I saw it yesterday and it\nput me in mind of what I have long wanted to do,\" he\nsaid, and again he looked away over the head of the boy\nwith the wavering, uncertain stare in his eyes.\n\nAfter the feeling of exaltation that had come to the\nfarmer as a result of his successful year, another mood\nhad taken possession of him. For a long time he had\nbeen going about feeling very humble and prayerful.\nAgain he walked alone at night thinking of God and as\nhe walked he again connected his own figure with the\nfigures of old days. Under the stars he knelt on the\nwet grass and raised up his voice in prayer. Now he had\ndecided that like the men whose stories filled the\npages of the Bible, he would make a sacrifice to God.\n\"I have been given these abundant crops and God has\nalso sent me a boy who is called David,\" he whispered\nto himself. \"Perhaps I should have done this thing long\nago.\" He was sorry the idea had not come into his mind\nin the days before his daughter Louise had been born\nand thought that surely now when he had erected a pile\nof burning sticks in some lonely place in the woods and\nhad offered the body of a lamb as a burnt offering, God\nwould appear to him and give him a message.\n\nMore and more as he thought of the matter, he thought\nalso of David and his passionate self-love was\npartially forgotten. \"It is time for the boy to begin\nthinking of going out into the world and the message\nwill be one concerning him,\" he decided. \"God will make\na pathway for him. He will tell me what place David is\nto take in life and when he shall set out on his\njourney. It is right that the boy should be there. If I\nam fortunate and an angel of God should appear, David\nwill see the beauty and glory of God made manifest to\nman. It will make a true man of God of him also.\"\n\nIn silence Jesse and David drove along the road until\nthey came to that place where Jesse had once before\nappealed to God and had frightened his grandson. The\nmorning had been bright and cheerful, but a cold wind\nnow began to blow and clouds hid the sun. When David\nsaw the place to which they had come he began to\ntremble with fright, and when they stopped by the\nbridge where the creek came down from among the trees,\nhe wanted to spring out of the phaeton and run away.\n\nA dozen plans for escape ran through David's head, but\nwhen Jesse stopped the horse and climbed over the fence\ninto the wood, he followed. \"It is foolish to be\nafraid. Nothing will happen,\" he told himself as he\nwent along with the lamb in his arms. There was\nsomething in the helplessness of the little animal held\nso tightly in his arms that gave him courage. He could\nfeel the rapid beating of the beast's heart and that\nmade his own heart beat less rapidly. As he walked\nswiftly along behind his grandfather, he untied the\nstring with which the four legs of the lamb were\nfastened together. \"If anything happens we will run\naway together,\" he thought.\n\nIn the woods, after they had gone a long way from the\nroad, Jesse stopped in an opening among the trees where\na clearing, overgrown with small bushes, ran up from\nthe creek. He was still silent but began at once to\nerect a heap of dry sticks which he presently set\nafire. The boy sat on the ground with the lamb in his\narms. His imagination began to invest every movement of\nthe old man with significance and he became every\nmoment more afraid. \"I must put the blood of the lamb\non the head of the boy,\" Jesse muttered when the sticks\nhad begun to blaze greedily, and taking a long knife\nfrom his pocket he turned and walked rapidly across the\nclearing toward David.\n\nTerror seized upon the soul of the boy. He was sick\nwith it. For a moment he sat perfectly still and then\nhis body stiffened and he sprang to his feet. His face\nbecame as white as the fleece of the lamb that, now\nfinding itself suddenly released, ran down the hill.\nDavid ran also. Fear made his feet fly. Over the low\nbushes and logs he leaped frantically. As he ran he put\nhis hand into his pocket and took out the branched\nstick from which the sling for shooting squirrels was\nsuspended. When he came to the creek that was shallow\nand splashed down over the stones, he dashed into the\nwater and turned to look back, and when he saw his\ngrandfather still running toward him with the long\nknife held tightly in his hand he did not hesitate, but\nreaching down, selected a stone and put it in the\nsling. With all his strength he drew back the heavy\nrubber bands and the stone whistled through the air. It\nhit Jesse, who had entirely forgotten the boy and was\npursuing the lamb, squarely in the head. With a groan\nhe pitched forward and fell almost at the boy's feet.\nWhen David saw that he lay still and that he was\napparently dead, his fright increased immeasurably. It\nbecame an insane panic.\n\nWith a cry he turned and ran off through the woods\nweeping convulsively. \"I don't care--I killed him, but\nI don't care,\" he sobbed. As he ran on and on he\ndecided suddenly that he would never go back again to\nthe Bentley farms or to the town of Winesburg. \"I have\nkilled the man of God and now I will myself be a man\nand go into the world,\" he said stoutly as he stopped\nrunning and walked rapidly down a road that followed\nthe windings of Wine Creek as it ran through fields and\nforests into the west.\n\nOn the ground by the creek Jesse Bentley moved uneasily\nabout. He groaned and opened his eyes. For a long time\nhe lay perfectly still and looked at the sky. When at\nlast he got to his feet, his mind was confused and he\nwas not surprised by the boy's disappearance. By the\nroadside he sat down on a log and began to talk about\nGod. That is all they ever got out of him. Whenever\nDavid's name was mentioned he looked vaguely at the sky\nand said that a messenger from God had taken the boy.\n\"It happened because I was too greedy for glory,\" he\ndeclared, and would have no more to say in the matter.\n\n\n\n\nA MAN OF IDEAS\n\nHe lived with his mother, a grey, silent woman with a\npeculiar ashy complexion. The house in which they lived\nstood in a little grove of trees beyond where the main\nstreet of Winesburg crossed Wine Creek. His name was\nJoe Welling, and his father had been a man of some\ndignity in the community, a lawyer, and a member of the\nstate legislature at Columbus. Joe himself was small of\nbody and in his character unlike anyone else in town.\nHe was like a tiny little volcano that lies silent for\ndays and then suddenly spouts fire. No, he wasn't like\nthat--he was like a man who is subject to fits, one\nwho walks among his fellow men inspiring fear because a\nfit may come upon him suddenly and blow him away into a\nstrange uncanny physical state in which his eyes roll\nand his legs and arms jerk. He was like that, only that\nthe visitation that descended upon Joe Welling was a\nmental and not a physical thing. He was beset by ideas\nand in the throes of one of his ideas was\nuncontrollable. Words rolled and tumbled from his\nmouth. A peculiar smile came upon his lips. The edges\nof his teeth that were tipped with gold glistened in\nthe light. Pouncing upon a bystander he began to talk.\nFor the bystander there was no escape. The excited man\nbreathed into his face, peered into his eyes, pounded\nupon his chest with a shaking forefinger, demanded,\ncompelled attention.\n\nIn those days the Standard Oil Company did not deliver\noil to the consumer in big wagons and motor trucks as\nit does now, but delivered instead to retail grocers,\nhardware stores, and the like. Joe was the Standard Oil\nagent in Winesburg and in several towns up and down the\nrailroad that went through Winesburg. He collected\nbills, booked orders, and did other things. His father,\nthe legislator, had secured the job for him.\n\nIn and out of the stores of Winesburg went Joe\nWelling--silent, excessively polite, intent upon his\nbusiness. Men watched him with eyes in which lurked\namusement tempered by alarm. They were waiting for him\nto break forth, preparing to flee. Although the\nseizures that came upon him were harmless enough, they\ncould not be laughed away. They were overwhelming.\nAstride an idea, Joe was overmastering. His personality\nbecame gigantic. It overrode the man to whom he talked,\nswept him away, swept all away, all who stood within\nsound of his voice.\n\nIn Sylvester West's Drug Store stood four men who were\ntalking of horse racing. Wesley Moyer's stallion, Tony\nTip, was to race at the June meeting at Tiffin, Ohio,\nand there was a rumor that he would meet the stiffest\ncompetition of his career. It was said that Pop Geers,\nthe great racing driver, would himself be there. A\ndoubt of the success of Tony Tip hung heavy in the air\nof Winesburg.\n\nInto the drug store came Joe Welling, brushing the\nscreen door violently aside. With a strange absorbed\nlight in his eyes he pounced upon Ed Thomas, he who\nknew Pop Geers and whose opinion of Tony Tip's chances\nwas worth considering.\n\n\"The water is up in Wine Creek,\" cried Joe Welling with\nthe air of Pheidippides bringing news of the victory of\nthe Greeks in the struggle at Marathon. His finger beat\na tattoo upon Ed Thomas's broad chest. \"By Trunion\nbridge it is within eleven and a half inches of the\nflooring,\" he went on, the words coming quickly and\nwith a little whistling noise from between his teeth.\nAn expression of helpless annoyance crept over the\nfaces of the four.\n\n\"I have my facts correct. Depend upon that. I went to\nSinnings' Hardware Store and got a rule. Then I went\nback and measured. I could hardly believe my own eyes.\nIt hasn't rained you see for ten days. At first I\ndidn't know what to think. Thoughts rushed through my\nhead. I thought of subterranean passages and springs.\nDown under the ground went my mind, delving about. I\nsat on the floor of the bridge and rubbed my head.\nThere wasn't a cloud in the sky, not one. Come out into\nthe street and you'll see. There wasn't a cloud. There\nisn't a cloud now. Yes, there was a cloud. I don't want\nto keep back any facts. There was a cloud in the west\ndown near the horizon, a cloud no bigger than a man's\nhand.\n\n\"Not that I think that has anything to do with it.\nThere it is, you see. You understand how puzzled I was.\n\n\"Then an idea came to me. I laughed. You'll laugh,\ntoo. Of course it rained over in Medina County. That's\ninteresting, eh? If we had no trains, no mails, no\ntelegraph, we would know that it rained over in Medina\nCounty. That's where Wine Creek comes from. Everyone\nknows that. Little old Wine Creek brought us the news.\nThat's interesting. I laughed. I thought I'd tell\nyou--it's interesting, eh?\"\n\nJoe Welling turned and went out at the door. Taking a\nbook from his pocket, he stopped and ran a finger down\none of the pages. Again he was absorbed in his duties\nas agent of the Standard Oil Company. \"Hern's Grocery\nwill be getting low on coal oil. I'll see them,\" he\nmuttered, hurrying along the street, and bowing\npolitely to the right and left at the people walking\npast.\n\nWhen George Willard went to work for the Winesburg\nEagle he was besieged by Joe Welling. Joe envied the\nboy. It seemed to him that he was meant by Nature to be\na reporter on a newspaper. \"It is what I should be\ndoing, there is no doubt of that,\" he declared,\nstopping George Willard on the sidewalk before\nDaugherty's Feed Store. His eyes began to glisten and\nhis forefinger to tremble. \"Of course I make more money\nwith the Standard Oil Company and I'm only telling\nyou,\" he added. \"I've got nothing against you but I\nshould have your place. I could do the work at odd\nmoments. Here and there I would run finding out things\nyou'll never see.\"\n\nBecoming more excited Joe Welling crowded the young\nreporter against the front of the feed store. He\nappeared to be lost in thought, rolling his eyes about\nand running a thin nervous hand through his hair. A\nsmile spread over his face and his gold teeth\nglittered. \"You get out your note book,\" he commanded.\n\"You carry a little pad of paper in your pocket, don't\nyou? I knew you did. Well, you set this down. I thought\nof it the other day. Let's take decay. Now what is\ndecay? It's fire. It burns up wood and other things.\nYou never thought of that? Of course not. This sidewalk\nhere and this feed store, the trees down the street\nthere--they're all on fire. They're burning up. Decay\nyou see is always going on. It doesn't stop. Water and\npaint can't stop it. If a thing is iron, then what? It\nrusts, you see. That's fire, too. The world is on fire.\nStart your pieces in the paper that way. Just say in\nbig letters 'The World Is On Fire.' That will make 'em\nlook up. They'll say you're a smart one. I don't care.\nI don't envy you. I just snatched that idea out of the\nair. I would make a newspaper hum. You got to admit\nthat.\"'\n\nTurning quickly, Joe Welling walked rapidly away. When\nhe had taken several steps he stopped and looked back.\n\"I'm going to stick to you,\" he said. \"I'm going to\nmake you a regular hummer. I should start a newspaper\nmyself, that's what I should do. I'd be a marvel.\nEverybody knows that.\"\n\nWhen George Willard had been for a year on the\nWinesburg Eagle, four things happened to Joe Welling.\nHis mother died, he came to live at the New Willard\nHouse, he became involved in a love affair, and he\norganized the Winesburg Baseball Club.\n\nJoe organized the baseball club because he wanted to be\na coach and in that position he began to win the\nrespect of his townsmen. \"He is a wonder,\" they\ndeclared after Joe's team had whipped the team from\nMedina County. \"He gets everybody working together. You\njust watch him.\"\n\nUpon the baseball field Joe Welling stood by first\nbase, his whole body quivering with excitement. In\nspite of themselves all the players watched him\nclosely. The opposing pitcher became confused.\n\n\"Now! Now! Now! Now!\" shouted the excited man. \"Watch\nme! Watch me! Watch my fingers! Watch my hands! Watch\nmy feet! Watch my eyes! Let's work together here! Watch\nme! In me you see all the movements of the game! Work\nwith me! Work with me! Watch me! Watch me! Watch me!\"\n\nWith runners of the Winesburg team on bases, Joe\nWelling became as one inspired. Before they knew what\nhad come over them, the base runners were watching the\nman, edging off the bases, advancing, retreating, held\nas by an invisible cord. The players of the opposing\nteam also watched Joe. They were fascinated. For a\nmoment they watched and then, as though to break a\nspell that hung over them, they began hurling the ball\nwildly about, and amid a series of fierce animal-like\ncries from the coach, the runners of the Winesburg team\nscampered home.\n\nJoe Welling's love affair set the town of Winesburg on\nedge. When it began everyone whispered and shook his\nhead. When people tried to laugh, the laughter was\nforced and unnatural. Joe fell in love with Sarah King,\na lean, sad-looking woman who lived with her father and\nbrother in a brick house that stood opposite the gate\nleading to the Winesburg Cemetery.\n\nThe two Kings, Edward the father, and Tom the son, were\nnot popular in Winesburg. They were called proud and\ndangerous. They had come to Winesburg from some place\nin the South and ran a cider mill on the Trunion Pike.\nTom King was reported to have killed a man before he\ncame to Winesburg. He was twenty-seven years old and\nrode about town on a grey pony. Also he had a long\nyellow mustache that dropped down over his teeth, and\nalways carried a heavy, wicked-looking walking stick in\nhis hand. Once he killed a dog with the stick. The dog\nbelonged to Win Pawsey, the shoe merchant, and stood on\nthe sidewalk wagging its tail. Tom King killed it with\none blow. He was arrested and paid a fine of ten\ndollars.\n\nOld Edward King was small of stature and when he passed\npeople in the street laughed a queer unmirthful laugh.\nWhen he laughed he scratched his left elbow with his\nright hand. The sleeve of his coat was almost worn\nthrough from the habit. As he walked along the street,\nlooking nervously about and laughing, he seemed more\ndangerous than his silent, fierce-looking son.\n\nWhen Sarah King began walking out in the evening with\nJoe Welling, people shook their heads in alarm. She was\ntall and pale and had dark rings under her eyes. The\ncouple looked ridiculous together. Under the trees they\nwalked and Joe talked. His passionate eager\nprotestations of love, heard coming out of the darkness\nby the cemetery wall, or from the deep shadows of the\ntrees on the hill that ran up to the Fair Grounds from\nWaterworks Pond, were repeated in the stores. Men stood\nby the bar in the New Willard House laughing and\ntalking of Joe's courtship. After the laughter came the\nsilence. The Winesburg baseball team, under his\nmanagement, was winning game after game, and the town\nhad begun to respect him. Sensing a tragedy, they\nwaited, laughing nervously.\n\nLate on a Saturday afternoon the meeting between Joe\nWelling and the two Kings, the anticipation of which\nhad set the town on edge, took place in Joe Welling's\nroom in the New Willard House. George Willard was a\nwitness to the meeting. It came about in this way:\n\nWhen the young reporter went to his room after the\nevening meal he saw Tom King and his father sitting in\nthe half darkness in Joe's room. The son had the heavy\nwalking stick in his hand and sat near the door. Old\nEdward King walked nervously about, scratching his left\nelbow with his right hand. The hallways were empty and\nsilent.\n\nGeorge Willard went to his own room and sat down at his\ndesk. He tried to write but his hand trembled so that\nhe could not hold the pen. He also walked nervously up\nand down. Like the rest of the town of Winesburg he was\nperplexed and knew not what to do.\n\nIt was seven-thirty and fast growing dark when Joe\nWelling came along the station platform toward the New\nWillard House. In his arms he held a bundle of weeds\nand grasses. In spite of the terror that made his body\nshake, George Willard was amused at the sight of the\nsmall spry figure holding the grasses and half running\nalong the platform.\n\nShaking with fright and anxiety, the young reporter\nlurked in the hallway outside the door of the room in\nwhich Joe Welling talked to the two Kings. There had\nbeen an oath, the nervous giggle of old Edward King,\nand then silence. Now the voice of Joe Welling, sharp\nand clear, broke forth. George Willard began to laugh.\nHe understood. As he had swept all men before him, so\nnow Joe Welling was carrying the two men in the room\noff their feet with a tidal wave of words. The listener\nin the hall walked up and down, lost in amazement.\n\nInside the room Joe Welling had paid no attention to\nthe grumbled threat of Tom King. Absorbed in an idea he\nclosed the door and, lighting a lamp, spread the\nhandful of weeds and grasses upon the floor. \"I've got\nsomething here,\" he announced solemnly. \"I was going to\ntell George Willard about it, let him make a piece out\nof it for the paper. I'm glad you're here. I wish Sarah\nwere here also. I've been going to come to your house\nand tell you of some of my ideas. They're interesting.\nSarah wouldn't let me. She said we'd quarrel. That's\nfoolish.\"\n\nRunning up and down before the two perplexed men, Joe\nWelling began to explain. \"Don't you make a mistake\nnow,\" he cried. \"This is something big.\" His voice was\nshrill with excitement. \"You just follow me, you'll be\ninterested. I know you will. Suppose this--suppose all\nof the wheat, the corn, the oats, the peas, the\npotatoes, were all by some miracle swept away. Now here\nwe are, you see, in this county. There is a high fence\nbuilt all around us. We'll suppose that. No one can get\nover the fence and all the fruits of the earth are\ndestroyed, nothing left but these wild things, these\ngrasses. Would we be done for? I ask you that. Would we\nbe done for?\" Again Tom King growled and for a moment\nthere was silence in the room. Then again Joe plunged\ninto the exposition of his idea. \"Things would go hard\nfor a time. I admit that. I've got to admit that. No\ngetting around it. We'd be hard put to it. More than\none fat stomach would cave in. But they couldn't down\nus. I should say not.\"\n\nTom King laughed good naturedly and the shivery,\nnervous laugh of Edward King rang through the house.\nJoe Welling hurried on. \"We'd begin, you see, to breed\nup new vegetables and fruits. Soon we'd regain all we\nhad lost. Mind, I don't say the new things would be the\nsame as the old. They wouldn't. Maybe they'd be better,\nmaybe not so good. That's interesting, eh? You can\nthink about that. It starts your mind working, now\ndon't it?\"\n\nIn the room there was silence and then again old Edward\nKing laughed nervously. \"Say, I wish Sarah was here,\"\ncried Joe Welling. \"Let's go up to your house. I want\nto tell her of this.\"\n\nThere was a scraping of chairs in the room. It was\nthen that George Willard retreated to his own room.\nLeaning out at the window he saw Joe Welling going\nalong the street with the two Kings. Tom King was\nforced to take extraordinary long strides to keep pace\nwith the little man. As he strode along, he leaned\nover, listening--absorbed, fascinated. Joe Welling\nagain talked excitedly. \"Take milkweed now,\" he cried.\n\"A lot might be done with milkweed, eh? It's almost\nunbelievable. I want you to think about it. I want you\ntwo to think about it. There would be a new vegetable\nkingdom you see. It's interesting, eh? It's an idea.\nWait till you see Sarah, she'll get the idea. She'll be\ninterested. Sarah is always interested in ideas. You\ncan't be too smart for Sarah, now can you? Of course\nyou can't. You know that.\"\n\n\n\n\nADVENTURE\n\nAlice Hindman, a woman of twenty-seven when George\nWillard was a mere boy, had lived in Winesburg all her\nlife. She clerked in Winney's Dry Goods Store and lived\nwith her mother, who had married a second husband.\n\nAlice's step-father was a carriage painter, and given\nto drink. His story is an odd one. It will be worth\ntelling some day.\n\nAt twenty-seven Alice was tall and somewhat slight.\nHer head was large and overshadowed her body. Her\nshoulders were a little stooped and her hair and eyes\nbrown. She was very quiet but beneath a placid exterior\na continual ferment went on.\n\nWhen she was a girl of sixteen and before she began to\nwork in the store, Alice had an affair with a young\nman. The young man, named Ned Currie, was older than\nAlice. He, like George Willard, was employed on the\nWinesburg Eagle and for a long time he went to see\nAlice almost every evening. Together the two walked\nunder the trees through the streets of the town and\ntalked of what they would do with their lives. Alice\nwas then a very pretty girl and Ned Currie took her\ninto his arms and kissed her. He became excited and\nsaid things he did not intend to say and Alice,\nbetrayed by her desire to have something beautiful come\ninto her rather narrow life, also grew excited. She\nalso talked. The outer crust of her life, all of her\nnatural diffidence and reserve, was torn away and she\ngave herself over to the emotions of love. When, late\nin the fall of her sixteenth year, Ned Currie went away\nto Cleveland where he hoped to get a place on a city\nnewspaper and rise in the world, she wanted to go with\nhim. With a trembling voice she told him what was in\nher mind. \"I will work and you can work,\" she said. \"I\ndo not want to harness you to a needless expense that\nwill prevent your making progress. Don't marry me now.\nWe will get along without that and we can be together.\nEven though we live in the same house no one will say\nanything. In the city we will be unknown and people\nwill pay no attention to us.\"\n\nNed Currie was puzzled by the determination and abandon\nof his sweetheart and was also deeply touched. He had\nwanted the girl to become his mistress but changed his\nmind. He wanted to protect and care for her. \"You don't\nknow what you're talking about,\" he said sharply; \"you\nmay be sure I'll let you do no such thing. As soon as I\nget a good job I'll come back. For the present you'll\nhave to stay here. It's the only thing we can do.\"\n\nOn the evening before he left Winesburg to take up his\nnew life in the city, Ned Currie went to call on Alice.\nThey walked about through the streets for an hour and\nthen got a rig from Wesley Moyer's livery and went for\na drive in the country. The moon came up and they found\nthemselves unable to talk. In his sadness the young man\nforgot the resolutions he had made regarding his\nconduct with the girl.\n\nThey got out of the buggy at a place where a long\nmeadow ran down to the bank of Wine Creek and there in\nthe dim light became lovers. When at midnight they\nreturned to town they were both glad. It did not seem\nto them that anything that could happen in the future\ncould blot out the wonder and beauty of the thing that\nhad happened. \"Now we will have to stick to each other,\nwhatever happens we will have to do that,\" Ned Currie\nsaid as he left the girl at her father's door.\n\nThe young newspaper man did not succeed in getting a\nplace on a Cleveland paper and went west to Chicago.\nFor a time he was lonely and wrote to Alice almost\nevery day. Then he was caught up by the life of the\ncity; he began to make friends and found new interests\nin life. In Chicago he boarded at a house where there\nwere several women. One of them attracted his attention\nand he forgot Alice in Winesburg. At the end of a year\nhe had stopped writing letters, and only once in a long\ntime, when he was lonely or when he went into one of\nthe city parks and saw the moon shining on the grass as\nit had shone that night on the meadow by Wine Creek,\ndid he think of her at all.\n\nIn Winesburg the girl who had been loved grew to be a\nwoman. When she was twenty-two years old her father,\nwho owned a harness repair shop, died suddenly. The\nharness maker was an old soldier, and after a few\nmonths his wife received a widow's pension. She used\nthe first money she got to buy a loom and became a\nweaver of carpets, and Alice got a place in Winney's\nstore. For a number of years nothing could have induced\nher to believe that Ned Currie would not in the end\nreturn to her.\n\nShe was glad to be employed because the daily round of\ntoil in the store made the time of waiting seem less\nlong and uninteresting. She began to save money,\nthinking that when she had saved two or three hundred\ndollars she would follow her lover to the city and try\nif her presence would not win back his affections.\n\nAlice did not blame Ned Currie for what had happened in\nthe moonlight in the field, but felt that she could\nnever marry another man. To her the thought of giving\nto another what she still felt could belong only to Ned\nseemed monstrous. When other young men tried to attract\nher attention she would have nothing to do with them.\n\"I am his wife and shall remain his wife whether he\ncomes back or not,\" she whispered to herself, and for\nall of her willingness to support herself could not\nhave understood the growing modern idea of a woman's\nowning herself and giving and taking for her own ends\nin life.\n\nAlice worked in the dry goods store from eight in the\nmorning until six at night and on three evenings a week\nwent back to the store to stay from seven until nine.\nAs time passed and she became more and more lonely she\nbegan to practice the devices common to lonely people.\nWhen at night she went upstairs into her own room she\nknelt on the floor to pray and in her prayers whispered\nthings she wanted to say to her lover. She became\nattached to inanimate objects, and because it was her\nown, could not bare to have anyone touch the furniture\nof her room. The trick of saving money, begun for a\npurpose, was carried on after the scheme of going to\nthe city to find Ned Currie had been given up. It\nbecame a fixed habit, and when she needed new clothes\nshe did not get them. Sometimes on rainy afternoons in\nthe store she got out her bank book and, letting it lie\nopen before her, spent hours dreaming impossible dreams\nof saving money enough so that the interest would\nsupport both herself and her future husband.\n\n\"Ned always liked to travel about,\" she thought. \"I'll\ngive him the chance. Some day when we are married and I\ncan save both his money and my own, we will be rich.\nThen we can travel together all over the world.\"\n\nIn the dry goods store weeks ran into months and months\ninto years as Alice waited and dreamed of her lover's\nreturn. Her employer, a grey old man with false teeth\nand a thin grey mustache that drooped down over his\nmouth, was not given to conversation, and sometimes, on\nrainy days and in the winter when a storm raged in Main\nStreet, long hours passed when no customers came in.\nAlice arranged and rearranged the stock. She stood near\nthe front window where she could look down the deserted\nstreet and thought of the evenings when she had walked\nwith Ned Currie and of what he had said. \"We will have\nto stick to each other now.\" The words echoed and\nre-echoed through the mind of the maturing woman. Tears\ncame into her eyes. Sometimes when her employer had\ngone out and she was alone in the store she put her\nhead on the counter and wept. \"Oh, Ned, I am waiting,\"\nshe whispered over and over, and all the time the\ncreeping fear that he would never come back grew\nstronger within her.\n\nIn the spring when the rains have passed and before the\nlong hot days of summer have come, the country about\nWinesburg is delightful. The town lies in the midst of\nopen fields, but beyond the fields are pleasant patches\nof woodlands. In the wooded places are many little\ncloistered nooks, quiet places where lovers go to sit\non Sunday afternoons. Through the trees they look out\nacross the fields and see farmers at work about the\nbarns or people driving up and down on the roads. In\nthe town bells ring and occasionally a train passes,\nlooking like a toy thing in the distance.\n\nFor several years after Ned Currie went away Alice did\nnot go into the wood with the other young people on\nSunday, but one day after he had been gone for two or\nthree years and when her loneliness seemed unbearable,\nshe put on her best dress and set out. Finding a little\nsheltered place from which she could see the town and a\nlong stretch of the fields, she sat down. Fear of age\nand ineffectuality took possession of her. She could\nnot sit still, and arose. As she stood looking out over\nthe land something, perhaps the thought of never\nceasing life as it expresses itself in the flow of the\nseasons, fixed her mind on the passing years. With a\nshiver of dread, she realized that for her the beauty\nand freshness of youth had passed. For the first time\nshe felt that she had been cheated. She did not blame\nNed Currie and did not know what to blame. Sadness\nswept over her. Dropping to her knees, she tried to\npray, but instead of prayers words of protest came to\nher lips. \"It is not going to come to me. I will never\nfind happiness. Why do I tell myself lies?\" she cried,\nand an odd sense of relief came with this, her first\nbold attempt to face the fear that had become a part of\nher everyday life.\n\nIn the year when Alice Hindman became twenty-five two\nthings happened to disturb the dull uneventfulness of\nher days. Her mother married Bush Milton, the carriage\npainter of Winesburg, and she herself became a member\nof the Winesburg Methodist Church. Alice joined the\nchurch because she had become frightened by the\nloneliness of her position in life. Her mother's second\nmarriage had emphasized her isolation. \"I am becoming\nold and queer. If Ned comes he will not want me. In the\ncity where he is living men are perpetually young.\nThere is so much going on that they do not have time to\ngrow old,\" she told herself with a grim little smile,\nand went resolutely about the business of becoming\nacquainted with people. Every Thursday evening when the\nstore had closed she went to a prayer meeting in the\nbasement of the church and on Sunday evening attended a\nmeeting of an organization called The Epworth League.\n\nWhen Will Hurley, a middle-aged man who clerked in a\ndrug store and who also belonged to the church, offered\nto walk home with her she did not protest. \"Of course I\nwill not let him make a practice of being with me, but\nif he comes to see me once in a long time there can be\nno harm in that,\" she told herself, still determined in\nher loyalty to Ned Currie.\n\nWithout realizing what was happening, Alice was trying\nfeebly at first, but with growing determination, to get\na new hold upon life. Beside the drug clerk she walked\nin silence, but sometimes in the darkness as they went\nstolidly along she put out her hand and touched softly\nthe folds of his coat. When he left her at the gate\nbefore her mother's house she did not go indoors, but\nstood for a moment by the door. She wanted to call to\nthe drug clerk, to ask him to sit with her in the\ndarkness on the porch before the house, but was afraid\nhe would not understand. \"It is not him that I want,\"\nshe told herself; \"I want to avoid being so much alone.\nIf I am not careful I will grow unaccustomed to being\nwith people.\"\n\n            *       *       *\n\nDuring the early fall of her twenty-seventh year a\npassionate restlessness took possession of Alice. She\ncould not bear to be in the company of the drug clerk,\nand when, in the evening, he came to walk with her she\nsent him away. Her mind became intensely active and\nwhen, weary from the long hours of standing behind the\ncounter in the store, she went home and crawled into\nbed, she could not sleep. With staring eyes she looked\ninto the darkness. Her imagination, like a child\nawakened from long sleep, played about the room. Deep\nwithin her there was something that would not be\ncheated by phantasies and that demanded some definite\nanswer from life.\n\nAlice took a pillow into her arms and held it tightly\nagainst her breasts. Getting out of bed, she arranged a\nblanket so that in the darkness it looked like a form\nlying between the sheets and, kneeling beside the bed,\nshe caressed it, whispering words over and over, like a\nrefrain. \"Why doesn't something happen? Why am I left\nhere alone?\" she muttered. Although she sometimes\nthought of Ned Currie, she no longer depended on him.\nHer desire had grown vague. She did not want Ned Currie\nor any other man. She wanted to be loved, to have\nsomething answer the call that was growing louder and\nlouder within her.\n\nAnd then one night when it rained Alice had an\nadventure. It frightened and confused her. She had come\nhome from the store at nine and found the house empty.\nBush Milton had gone off to town and her mother to the\nhouse of a neighbor. Alice went upstairs to her room\nand undressed in the darkness. For a moment she stood\nby the window hearing the rain beat against the glass\nand then a strange desire took possession of her.\nWithout stopping to think of what she intended to do,\nshe ran downstairs through the dark house and out into\nthe rain. As she stood on the little grass plot before\nthe house and felt the cold rain on her body a mad\ndesire to run naked through the streets took possession\nof her.\n\nShe thought that the rain would have some creative and\nwonderful effect on her body. Not for years had she\nfelt so full of youth and courage. She wanted to leap\nand run, to cry out, to find some other lonely human\nand embrace him. On the brick sidewalk before the house\na man stumbled homeward. Alice started to run. A wild,\ndesperate mood took possession of her. \"What do I care\nwho it is. He is alone, and I will go to him,\" she\nthought; and then without stopping to consider the\npossible result of her madness, called softly. \"Wait!\"\nshe cried. \"Don't go away. Whoever you are, you must\nwait.\"\n\nThe man on the sidewalk stopped and stood listening.\nHe was an old man and somewhat deaf. Putting his hand\nto his mouth, he shouted. \"What? What say?\" he called.\n\nAlice dropped to the ground and lay trembling. She was\nso frightened at the thought of what she had done that\nwhen the man had gone on his way she did not dare get\nto her feet, but crawled on hands and knees through the\ngrass to the house. When she got to her own room she\nbolted the door and drew her dressing table across the\ndoorway. Her body shook as with a chill and her hands\ntrembled so that she had difficulty getting into her\nnightdress. When she got into bed she buried her face\nin the pillow and wept brokenheartedly. \"What is the\nmatter with me? I will do something dreadful if I am\nnot careful,\" she thought, and turning her face to the\nwall, began trying to force herself to face bravely the\nfact that many people must live and die alone, even in\nWinesburg.\n\n\n\n\nRESPECTABILITY\n\nIf you have lived in cities and have walked in the park\non a summer afternoon, you have perhaps seen, blinking\nin a corner of his iron cage, a huge, grotesque kind of\nmonkey, a creature with ugly, sagging, hairless skin\nbelow his eyes and a bright purple underbody. This\nmonkey is a true monster. In the completeness of his\nugliness he achieved a kind of perverted beauty.\nChildren stopping before the cage are fascinated, men\nturn away with an air of disgust, and women linger for\na moment, trying perhaps to remember which one of their\nmale acquaintances the thing in some faint way\nresembles.\n\nHad you been in the earlier years of your life a\ncitizen of the village of Winesburg, Ohio, there would\nhave been for you no mystery in regard to the beast in\nhis cage. \"It is like Wash Williams,\" you would have\nsaid. \"As he sits in the corner there, the beast is\nexactly like old Wash sitting on the grass in the\nstation yard on a summer evening after he has closed\nhis office for the night.\"\n\nWash Williams, the telegraph operator of Winesburg, was\nthe ugliest thing in town. His girth was immense, his\nneck thin, his legs feeble. He was dirty. Everything\nabout him was unclean. Even the whites of his eyes\nlooked soiled.\n\nI go too fast. Not everything about Wash was unclean.\nHe took care of his hands. His fingers were fat, but\nthere was something sensitive and shapely in the hand\nthat lay on the table by the instrument in the\ntelegraph office. In his youth Wash Williams had been\ncalled the best telegraph operator in the state, and in\nspite of his degradement to the obscure office at\nWinesburg, he was still proud of his ability.\n\nWash Williams did not associate with the men of the\ntown in which he lived. \"I'll have nothing to do with\nthem,\" he said, looking with bleary eyes at the men who\nwalked along the station platform past the telegraph\noffice. Up along Main Street he went in the evening to\nEd Griffith's saloon, and after drinking unbelievable\nquantities of beer staggered off to his room in the New\nWillard House and to his bed for the night.\n\nWash Williams was a man of courage. A thing had\nhappened to him that made him hate life, and he hated\nit wholeheartedly, with the abandon of a poet. First of\nall, he hated women. \"Bitches,\" he called them. His\nfeeling toward men was somewhat different. He pitied\nthem. \"Does not every man let his life be managed for\nhim by some bitch or another?\" he asked.\n\nIn Winesburg no attention was paid to Wash Williams and\nhis hatred of his fellows. Once Mrs. White, the\nbanker's wife, complained to the telegraph company,\nsaying that the office in Winesburg was dirty and\nsmelled abominably, but nothing came of her complaint.\nHere and there a man respected the operator.\nInstinctively the man felt in him a glowing resentment\nof something he had not the courage to resent. When\nWash walked through the streets such a one had an\ninstinct to pay him homage, to raise his hat or to bow\nbefore him. The superintendent who had supervision over\nthe telegraph operators on the railroad that went\nthrough Winesburg felt that way. He had put Wash into\nthe obscure office at Winesburg to avoid discharging\nhim, and he meant to keep him there. When he received\nthe letter of complaint from the banker's wife, he tore\nit up and laughed unpleasantly. For some reason he\nthought of his own wife as he tore up the letter.\n\nWash Williams once had a wife. When he was still a\nyoung man he married a woman at Dayton, Ohio. The woman\nwas tall and slender and had blue eyes and yellow hair.\nWash was himself a comely youth. He loved the woman\nwith a love as absorbing as the hatred he later felt\nfor all women.\n\nIn all of Winesburg there was but one person who knew\nthe story of the thing that had made ugly the person\nand the character of Wash Williams. He once told the\nstory to George Willard and the telling of the tale\ncame about in this way:\n\nGeorge Willard went one evening to walk with Belle\nCarpenter, a trimmer of women's hats who worked in a\nmillinery shop kept by Mrs. Kate McHugh. The young man\nwas not in love with the woman, who, in fact, had a\nsuitor who worked as bartender in Ed Griffith's saloon,\nbut as they walked about under the trees they\noccasionally embraced. The night and their own thoughts\nhad aroused something in them. As they were returning\nto Main Street they passed the little lawn beside the\nrailroad station and saw Wash Williams apparently\nasleep on the grass beneath a tree. On the next evening\nthe operator and George Willard walked out together.\nDown the railroad they went and sat on a pile of\ndecaying railroad ties beside the tracks. It was then\nthat the operator told the young reporter his story of\nhate.\n\nPerhaps a dozen times George Willard and the strange,\nshapeless man who lived at his father's hotel had been\non the point of talking. The young man looked at the\nhideous, leering face staring about the hotel dining\nroom and was consumed with curiosity. Something he saw\nlurking in the staring eyes told him that the man who\nhad nothing to say to others had nevertheless something\nto say to him. On the pile of railroad ties on the\nsummer evening, he waited expectantly. When the\noperator remained silent and seemed to have changed his\nmind about talking, he tried to make conversation.\n\"Were you ever married, Mr. Williams?\" he began. \"I\nsuppose you were and your wife is dead, is that it?\"\n\nWash Williams spat forth a succession of vile oaths.\n\"Yes, she is dead,\" he agreed. \"She is dead as all\nwomen are dead. She is a living-dead thing, walking in\nthe sight of men and making the earth foul by her\npresence.\" Staring into the boy's eyes, the man became\npurple with rage. \"Don't have fool notions in your\nhead,\" he commanded. \"My wife, she is dead; yes,\nsurely. I tell you, all women are dead, my mother, your\nmother, that tall dark woman who works in the millinery\nstore and with whom I saw you walking about\nyesterday--all of them, they are all dead. I tell you\nthere is something rotten about them. I was married,\nsure. My wife was dead before she married me, she was a\nfoul thing come out a woman more foul. She was a thing\nsent to make life unbearable to me. I was a fool, do\nyou see, as you are now, and so I married this woman. I\nwould like to see men a little begin to understand\nwomen. They are sent to prevent men making the world\nworth while. It is a trick in Nature. Ugh! They are\ncreeping, crawling, squirming things, they with their\nsoft hands and their blue eyes. The sight of a woman\nsickens me. Why I don't kill every woman I see I don't\nknow.\"\n\nHalf frightened and yet fascinated by the light burning\nin the eyes of the hideous old man, George Willard\nlistened, afire with curiosity. Darkness came on and he\nleaned forward trying to see the face of the man who\ntalked. When, in the gathering darkness, he could no\nlonger see the purple, bloated face and the burning\neyes, a curious fancy came to him. Wash Williams talked\nin low even tones that made his words seem the more\nterrible. In the darkness the young reporter found\nhimself imagining that he sat on the railroad ties\nbeside a comely young man with black hair and black\nshining eyes. There was something almost beautiful in\nthe voice of Wash Williams, the hideous, telling his\nstory of hate.\n\nThe telegraph operator of Winesburg, sitting in the\ndarkness on the railroad ties, had become a poet.\nHatred had raised him to that elevation. \"It is because\nI saw you kissing the lips of that Belle Carpenter that\nI tell you my story,\" he said. \"What happened to me may\nnext happen to you. I want to put you on your guard.\nAlready you may be having dreams in your head. I want\nto destroy them.\"\n\nWash Williams began telling the story of his married\nlife with the tall blonde girl with the blue eyes whom\nhe had met when he was a young operator at Dayton,\nOhio. Here and there his story was touched with moments\nof beauty intermingled with strings of vile curses. The\noperator had married the daughter of a dentist who was\nthe youngest of three sisters. On his marriage day,\nbecause of his ability, he was promoted to a position\nas dispatcher at an increased salary and sent to an\noffice at Columbus, Ohio. There he settled down with\nhis young wife and began buying a house on the\ninstallment plan.\n\nThe young telegraph operator was madly in love. With a\nkind of religious fervor he had managed to go through\nthe pitfalls of his youth and to remain virginal until\nafter his marriage. He made for George Willard a\npicture of his life in the house at Columbus, Ohio,\nwith the young wife. \"In the garden back of our house\nwe planted vegetables,\" he said, \"you know, peas and\ncorn and such things. We went to Columbus in early\nMarch and as soon as the days became warm I went to\nwork in the garden. With a spade I turned up the black\nground while she ran about laughing and pretending to\nbe afraid of the worms I uncovered. Late in April came\nthe planting. In the little paths among the seed beds\nshe stood holding a paper bag in her hand. The bag was\nfilled with seeds. A few at a time she handed me the\nseeds that I might thrust them into the warm, soft\nground.\"\n\nFor a moment there was a catch in the voice of the man\ntalking in the darkness. \"I loved her,\" he said. \"I\ndon't claim not to be a fool. I love her yet. There in\nthe dusk in the spring evening I crawled along the\nblack ground to her feet and groveled before her. I\nkissed her shoes and the ankles above her shoes. When\nthe hem of her garment touched my face I trembled. When\nafter two years of that life I found she had managed to\nacquire three other lovers who came regularly to our\nhouse when I was away at work, I didn't want to touch\nthem or her. I just sent her home to her mother and\nsaid nothing. There was nothing to say. I had four\nhundred dollars in the bank and I gave her that. I\ndidn't ask her reasons. I didn't say anything. When she\nhad gone I cried like a silly boy. Pretty soon I had a\nchance to sell the house and I sent that money to her.\"\n\nWash Williams and George Willard arose from the pile of\nrailroad ties and walked along the tracks toward town.\nThe operator finished his tale quickly, breathlessly.\n\n\"Her mother sent for me,\" he said. \"She wrote me a\nletter and asked me to come to their house at Dayton.\nWhen I got there it was evening about this time.\"\n\nWash Williams' voice rose to a half scream. \"I sat in\nthe parlor of that house two hours. Her mother took me\nin there and left me. Their house was stylish. They\nwere what is called respectable people. There were\nplush chairs and a couch in the room. I was trembling\nall over. I hated the men I thought had wronged her. I\nwas sick of living alone and wanted her back. The\nlonger I waited the more raw and tender I became. I\nthought that if she came in and just touched me with\nher hand I would perhaps faint away. I ached to forgive\nand forget.\"\n\nWash Williams stopped and stood staring at George\nWillard. The boy's body shook as from a chill. Again\nthe man's voice became soft and low. \"She came into the\nroom naked,\" he went on. \"Her mother did that. While I\nsat there she was taking the girl's clothes off,\nperhaps coaxing her to do it. First I heard voices at\nthe door that led into a little hallway and then it\nopened softly. The girl was ashamed and stood perfectly\nstill staring at the floor. The mother didn't come into\nthe room. When she had pushed the girl in through the\ndoor she stood in the hallway waiting, hoping we\nwould--well, you see--waiting.\"\n\nGeorge Willard and the telegraph operator came into the\nmain street of Winesburg. The lights from the store\nwindows lay bright and shining on the sidewalks. People\nmoved about laughing and talking. The young reporter\nfelt ill and weak. In imagination, he also became old\nand shapeless. \"I didn't get the mother killed,\" said\nWash Williams, staring up and down the street. \"I\nstruck her once with a chair and then the neighbors\ncame in and took it away. She screamed so loud you see.\nI won't ever have a chance to kill her now. She died of\na fever a month after that happened.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE THINKER\n\nThe house in which Seth Richmond of Winesburg lived\nwith his mother had been at one time the show place of\nthe town, but when young Seth lived there its glory had\nbecome somewhat dimmed. The huge brick house which\nBanker White had built on Buckeye Street had\novershadowed it. The Richmond place was in a little\nvalley far out at the end of Main Street. Farmers\ncoming into town by a dusty road from the south passed\nby a grove of walnut trees, skirted the Fair Ground\nwith its high board fence covered with advertisements,\nand trotted their horses down through the valley past\nthe Richmond place into town. As much of the country\nnorth and south of Winesburg was devoted to fruit and\nberry raising, Seth saw wagon-loads of berry\npickers--boys, girls, and women--going to the fields in\nthe morning and returning covered with dust in the\nevening. The chattering crowd, with their rude jokes\ncried out from wagon to wagon, sometimes irritated him\nsharply. He regretted that he also could not laugh\nboisterously, shout meaningless jokes and make of\nhimself a figure in the endless stream of moving,\ngiggling activity that went up and down the road.\n\nThe Richmond house was built of limestone, and,\nalthough it was said in the village to have become run\ndown, had in reality grown more beautiful with every\npassing year. Already time had begun a little to color\nthe stone, lending a golden richness to its surface and\nin the evening or on dark days touching the shaded\nplaces beneath the eaves with wavering patches of\nbrowns and blacks.\n\nThe house had been built by Seth's grandfather, a stone\nquarryman, and it, together with the stone quarries on\nLake Erie eighteen miles to the north, had been left to\nhis son, Clarence Richmond, Seth's father. Clarence\nRichmond, a quiet passionate man extraordinarily\nadmired by his neighbors, had been killed in a street\nfight with the editor of a newspaper in Toledo, Ohio.\nThe fight concerned the publication of Clarence\nRichmond's name coupled with that of a woman school\nteacher, and as the dead man had begun the row by\nfiring upon the editor, the effort to punish the slayer\nwas unsuccessful. After the quarryman's death it was\nfound that much of the money left to him had been\nsquandered in speculation and in insecure investments\nmade through the influence of friends.\n\nLeft with but a small income, Virginia Richmond had\nsettled down to a retired life in the village and to\nthe raising of her son. Although she had been deeply\nmoved by the death of the husband and father, she did\nnot at all believe the stories concerning him that ran\nabout after his death. To her mind, the sensitive,\nboyish man whom all had instinctively loved, was but an\nunfortunate, a being too fine for everyday life.\n\"You'll be hearing all sorts of stories, but you are\nnot to believe what you hear,\" she said to her son. \"He\nwas a good man, full of tenderness for everyone, and\nshould not have tried to be a man of affairs. No matter\nhow much I were to plan and dream of your future, I\ncould not imagine anything better for you than that you\nturn out as good a man as your father.\"\n\nSeveral years after the death of her husband, Virginia\nRichmond had become alarmed at the growing demands upon\nher income and had set herself to the task of\nincreasing it. She had learned stenography and through\nthe influence of her husband's friends got the position\nof court stenographer at the county seat. There she\nwent by train each morning during the sessions of the\ncourt, and when no court sat, spent her days working\namong the rosebushes in her garden. She was a tall,\nstraight figure of a woman with a plain face and a\ngreat mass of brown hair.\n\nIn the relationship between Seth Richmond and his\nmother, there was a quality that even at eighteen had\nbegun to color all of his traffic with men. An almost\nunhealthy respect for the youth kept the mother for the\nmost part silent in his presence. When she did speak\nsharply to him he had only to look steadily into her\neyes to see dawning there the puzzled look he had\nalready noticed in the eyes of others when he looked at\nthem.\n\nThe truth was that the son thought with remarkable\nclearness and the mother did not. She expected from all\npeople certain conventional reactions to life. A boy\nwas your son, you scolded him and he trembled and\nlooked at the floor. When you had scolded enough he\nwept and all was forgiven. After the weeping and when\nhe had gone to bed, you crept into his room and kissed\nhim.\n\nVirginia Richmond could not understand why her son did\nnot do these things. After the severest reprimand, he\ndid not tremble and look at the floor but instead\nlooked steadily at her, causing uneasy doubts to invade\nher mind. As for creeping into his room--after Seth\nhad passed his fifteenth year, she would have been half\nafraid to do anything of the kind.\n\nOnce when he was a boy of sixteen, Seth in company with\ntwo other boys ran away from home. The three boys\nclimbed into the open door of an empty freight car and\nrode some forty miles to a town where a fair was being\nheld. One of the boys had a bottle filled with a\ncombination of whiskey and blackberry wine, and the\nthree sat with legs dangling out of the car door\ndrinking from the bottle. Seth's two companions sang\nand waved their hands to idlers about the stations of\nthe towns through which the train passed. They planned\nraids upon the baskets of farmers who had come with\ntheir families to the fair. \"We will live like kings\nand won't have to spend a penny to see the fair and\nhorse races,\" they declared boastfully.\n\nAfter the disappearance of Seth, Virginia Richmond\nwalked up and down the floor of her home filled with\nvague alarms. Although on the next day she discovered,\nthrough an inquiry made by the town marshal, on what\nadventure the boys had gone, she could not quiet\nherself. All through the night she lay awake hearing\nthe clock tick and telling herself that Seth, like his\nfather, would come to a sudden and violent end. So\ndetermined was she that the boy should this time feel\nthe weight of her wrath that, although she would not\nallow the marshal to interfere with his adventure, she\ngot out a pencil and paper and wrote down a series of\nsharp, stinging reproofs she intended to pour out upon\nhim. The reproofs she committed to memory, going about\nthe garden and saying them aloud like an actor\nmemorizing his part.\n\nAnd when, at the end of the week, Seth returned, a\nlittle weary and with coal soot in his ears and about\nhis eyes, she again found herself unable to reprove\nhim. Walking into the house he hung his cap on a nail\nby the kitchen door and stood looking steadily at her.\n\"I wanted to turn back within an hour after we had\nstarted,\" he explained. \"I didn't know what to do. I\nknew you would be bothered, but I knew also that if I\ndidn't go on I would be ashamed of myself. I went\nthrough with the thing for my own good. It was\nuncomfortable, sleeping on wet straw, and two drunken\nNegroes came and slept with us. When I stole a lunch\nbasket out of a farmer's wagon I couldn't help thinking\nof his children going all day without food. I was sick\nof the whole affair, but I was determined to stick it\nout until the other boys were ready to come back.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you did stick it out,\" replied the mother,\nhalf resentfully, and kissing him upon the forehead\npretended to busy herself with the work about the\nhouse.\n\nOn a summer evening Seth Richmond went to the New\nWillard House to visit his friend, George Willard. It\nhad rained during the afternoon, but as he walked\nthrough Main Street, the sky had partially cleared and\na golden glow lit up the west. Going around a corner,\nhe turned in at the door of the hotel and began to\nclimb the stairway leading up to his friend's room. In\nthe hotel office the proprietor and two traveling men\nwere engaged in a discussion of politics.\n\nOn the stairway Seth stopped and listened to the voices\nof the men below. They were excited and talked rapidly.\nTom Willard was berating the traveling men. \"I am a\nDemocrat but your talk makes me sick,\" he said. \"You\ndon't understand McKinley. McKinley and Mark Hanna are\nfriends. It is impossible perhaps for your mind to\ngrasp that. If anyone tells you that a friendship can\nbe deeper and bigger and more worth while than dollars\nand cents, or even more worth while than state\npolitics, you snicker and laugh.\"\n\nThe landlord was interrupted by one of the guests, a\ntall, grey-mustached man who worked for a wholesale\ngrocery house. \"Do you think that I've lived in\nCleveland all these years without knowing Mark Hanna?\"\nhe demanded. \"Your talk is piffle. Hanna is after money\nand nothing else. This McKinley is his tool. He has\nMcKinley bluffed and don't you forget it.\"\n\nThe young man on the stairs did not linger to hear the\nrest of the discussion, but went on up the stairway and\ninto the little dark hall. Something in the voices of\nthe men talking in the hotel office started a chain of\nthoughts in his mind. He was lonely and had begun to\nthink that loneliness was a part of his character,\nsomething that would always stay with him. Stepping\ninto a side hall he stood by a window that looked into\nan alleyway. At the back of his shop stood Abner Groff,\nthe town baker. His tiny bloodshot eyes looked up and\ndown the alleyway. In his shop someone called the\nbaker, who pretended not to hear. The baker had an\nempty milk bottle in his hand and an angry sullen look\nin his eyes.\n\nIn Winesburg, Seth Richmond was called the \"deep one.\"\n\"He's like his father,\" men said as he went through the\nstreets. \"He'll break out some of these days. You wait\nand see.\"\n\nThe talk of the town and the respect with which men and\nboys instinctively greeted him, as all men greet silent\npeople, had affected Seth Richmond's outlook on life\nand on himself. He, like most boys, was deeper than\nboys are given credit for being, but he was not what\nthe men of the town, and even his mother, thought him\nto be. No great underlying purpose lay back of his\nhabitual silence, and he had no definite plan for his\nlife. When the boys with whom he associated were noisy\nand quarrelsome, he stood quietly at one side. With\ncalm eyes he watched the gesticulating lively figures\nof his companions. He wasn't particularly interested in\nwhat was going on, and sometimes wondered if he would\never be particularly interested in anything. Now, as he\nstood in the half-darkness by the window watching the\nbaker, he wished that he himself might become\nthoroughly stirred by something, even by the fits of\nsullen anger for which Baker Groff was noted. \"It would\nbe better for me if I could become excited and wrangle\nabout politics like windy old Tom Willard,\" he thought,\nas he left the window and went again along the hallway\nto the room occupied by his friend, George Willard.\n\nGeorge Willard was older than Seth Richmond, but in the\nrather odd friendship between the two, it was he who\nwas forever courting and the younger boy who was being\ncourted. The paper on which George worked had one\npolicy. It strove to mention by name in each issue, as\nmany as possible of the inhabitants of the village.\nLike an excited dog, George Willard ran here and there,\nnoting on his pad of paper who had gone on business to\nthe county seat or had returned from a visit to a\nneighboring village. All day he wrote little facts upon\nthe pad. \"A. P. Wringlet had received a shipment of\nstraw hats. Ed Byerbaum and Tom Marshall were in\nCleveland Friday. Uncle Tom Sinnings is building a new\nbarn on his place on the Valley Road.\"\n\nThe idea that George Willard would some day become a\nwriter had given him a place of distinction in\nWinesburg, and to Seth Richmond he talked continually\nof the matter, \"It's the easiest of all lives to live,\"\nhe declared, becoming excited and boastful. \"Here and\nthere you go and there is no one to boss you. Though\nyou are in India or in the South Seas in a boat, you\nhave but to write and there you are. Wait till I get my\nname up and then see what fun I shall have.\"\n\nIn George Willard's room, which had a window looking\ndown into an alleyway and one that looked across\nrailroad tracks to Biff Carter's Lunch Room facing the\nrailroad station, Seth Richmond sat in a chair and\nlooked at the floor. George Willard, who had been\nsitting for an hour idly playing with a lead pencil,\ngreeted him effusively. \"I've been trying to write a\nlove story,\" he explained, laughing nervously. Lighting\na pipe he began walking up and down the room. \"I know\nwhat I'm going to do. I'm going to fall in love. I've\nbeen sitting here and thinking it over and I'm going to\ndo it.\"\n\nAs though embarrassed by his declaration, George went\nto a window and turning his back to his friend leaned\nout. \"I know who I'm going to fall in love with,\" he\nsaid sharply. \"It's Helen White. She is the only girl\nin town with any 'get-up' to her.\"\n\nStruck with a new idea, young Willard turned and walked\ntoward his visitor. \"Look here,\" he said. \"You know\nHelen White better than I do. I want you to tell her\nwhat I said. You just get to talking to her and say\nthat I'm in love with her. See what she says to that.\nSee how she takes it, and then you come and tell me.\"\n\nSeth Richmond arose and went toward the door. The words\nof his comrade irritated him unbearably. \"Well,\ngood-bye,\" he said briefly.\n\nGeorge was amazed. Running forward he stood in the\ndarkness trying to look into Seth's face. \"What's the\nmatter? What are you going to do? You stay here and\nlet's talk,\" he urged.\n\nA wave of resentment directed against his friend, the\nmen of the town who were, he thought, perpetually\ntalking of nothing, and most of all, against his own\nhabit of silence, made Seth half desperate. \"Aw, speak\nto her yourself,\" he burst forth and then, going\nquickly through the door, slammed it sharply in his\nfriend's face. \"I'm going to find Helen White and talk\nto her, but not about him,\" he muttered.\n\nSeth went down the stairway and out at the front door\nof the hotel muttering with wrath. Crossing a little\ndusty street and climbing a low iron railing, he went\nto sit upon the grass in the station yard. George\nWillard he thought a profound fool, and he wished that\nhe had said so more vigorously. Although his\nacquaintanceship with Helen White, the banker's\ndaughter, was outwardly but casual, she was often the\nsubject of his thoughts and he felt that she was\nsomething private and personal to himself. \"The busy\nfool with his love stories,\" he muttered, staring back\nover his shoulder at George Willard's room, \"why does\nhe never tire of his eternal talking.\"\n\nIt was berry harvest time in Winesburg and upon the\nstation platform men and boys loaded the boxes of red,\nfragrant berries into two express cars that stood upon\nthe siding. A June moon was in the sky, although in the\nwest a storm threatened, and no street lamps were\nlighted. In the dim light the figures of the men\nstanding upon the express truck and pitching the boxes\nin at the doors of the cars were but dimly discernible.\nUpon the iron railing that protected the station lawn\nsat other men. Pipes were lighted. Village jokes went\nback and forth. Away in the distance a train whistled\nand the men loading the boxes into the cars worked with\nrenewed activity.\n\nSeth arose from his place on the grass and went\nsilently past the men perched upon the railing and into\nMain Street. He had come to a resolution. \"I'll get out\nof here,\" he told himself. \"What good am I here? I'm\ngoing to some city and go to work. I'll tell mother\nabout it tomorrow.\"\n\nSeth Richmond went slowly along Main Street, past\nWacker's Cigar Store and the Town Hall, and into\nBuckeye Street. He was depressed by the thought that he\nwas not a part of the life in his own town, but the\ndepression did not cut deeply as he did not think of\nhimself as at fault. In the heavy shadows of a big tree\nbefore Doctor Welling's house, he stopped and stood\nwatching half-witted Turk Smollet, who was pushing a\nwheelbarrow in the road. The old man with his absurdly\nboyish mind had a dozen long boards on the wheelbarrow,\nand, as he hurried along the road, balanced the load\nwith extreme nicety. \"Easy there, Turk! Steady now, old\nboy!\" the old man shouted to himself, and laughed so\nthat the load of boards rocked dangerously.\n\nSeth knew Turk Smollet, the half dangerous old wood\nchopper whose peculiarities added so much of color to\nthe life of the village. He knew that when Turk got\ninto Main Street he would become the center of a\nwhirlwind of cries and comments, that in truth the old\nman was going far out of his way in order to pass\nthrough Main Street and exhibit his skill in wheeling\nthe boards. \"If George Willard were here, he'd have\nsomething to say,\" thought Seth. \"George belongs to\nthis town. He'd shout at Turk and Turk would shout at\nhim. They'd both be secretly pleased by what they had\nsaid. It's different with me. I don't belong. I'll not\nmake a fuss about it, but I'm going to get out of\nhere.\"\n\nSeth stumbled forward through the half-darkness,\nfeeling himself an outcast in his own town. He began to\npity himself, but a sense of the absurdity of his\nthoughts made him smile. In the end he decided that he\nwas simply old beyond his years and not at all a\nsubject for self-pity. \"I'm made to go to work. I may\nbe able to make a place for myself by steady working,\nand I might as well be at it,\" he decided.\n\nSeth went to the house of Banker White and stood in the\ndarkness by the front door. On the door hung a heavy\nbrass knocker, an innovation introduced into the\nvillage by Helen White's mother, who had also organized\na women's club for the study of poetry. Seth raised the\nknocker and let it fall. Its heavy clatter sounded like\na report from distant guns. \"How awkward and foolish I\nam,\" he thought. \"If Mrs. White comes to the door, I\nwon't know what to say.\"\n\nIt was Helen White who came to the door and found Seth\nstanding at the edge of the porch. Blushing with\npleasure, she stepped forward, closing the door softly.\n\"I'm going to get out of town. I don't know what I'll\ndo, but I'm going to get out of here and go to work. I\nthink I'll go to Columbus,\" he said. \"Perhaps I'll get\ninto the State University down there. Anyway, I'm\ngoing. I'll tell mother tonight.\" He hesitated and\nlooked doubtfully about. \"Perhaps you wouldn't mind\ncoming to walk with me?\"\n\nSeth and Helen walked through the streets beneath the\ntrees. Heavy clouds had drifted across the face of the\nmoon, and before them in the deep twilight went a man\nwith a short ladder upon his shoulder. Hurrying\nforward, the man stopped at the street crossing and,\nputting the ladder against the wooden lamp-post,\nlighted the village lights so that their way was half\nlighted, half darkened, by the lamps and by the\ndeepening shadows cast by the low-branched trees. In\nthe tops of the trees the wind began to play,\ndisturbing the sleeping birds so that they flew about\ncalling plaintively. In the lighted space before one of\nthe lamps, two bats wheeled and circled, pursuing the\ngathering swarm of night flies.\n\nSince Seth had been a boy in knee trousers there had\nbeen a half expressed intimacy between him and the\nmaiden who now for the first time walked beside him.\nFor a time she had been beset with a madness for\nwriting notes which she addressed to Seth. He had found\nthem concealed in his books at school and one had been\ngiven him by a child met in the street, while several\nhad been delivered through the village post office.\n\nThe notes had been written in a round, boyish hand and\nhad reflected a mind inflamed by novel reading. Seth\nhad not answered them, although he had been moved and\nflattered by some of the sentences scrawled in pencil\nupon the stationery of the banker's wife. Putting them\ninto the pocket of his coat, he went through the street\nor stood by the fence in the school yard with something\nburning at his side. He thought it fine that he should\nbe thus selected as the favorite of the richest and\nmost attractive girl in town.\n\nHelen and Seth stopped by a fence near where a low dark\nbuilding faced the street. The building had once been a\nfactory for the making of barrel staves but was now\nvacant. Across the street upon the porch of a house a\nman and woman talked of their childhood, their voices\ncoming dearly across to the half-embarrassed youth and\nmaiden. There was the sound of scraping chairs and the\nman and woman came down the gravel path to a wooden\ngate. Standing outside the gate, the man leaned over\nand kissed the woman. \"For old times' sake,\" he said\nand, turning, walked rapidly away along the sidewalk.\n\n\"That's Belle Turner,\" whispered Helen, and put her\nhand boldly into Seth's hand. \"I didn't know she had a\nfellow. I thought she was too old for that.\" Seth\nlaughed uneasily. The hand of the girl was warm and a\nstrange, dizzy feeling crept over him. Into his mind\ncame a desire to tell her something he had been\ndetermined not to tell. \"George Willard's in love with\nyou,\" he said, and in spite of his agitation his voice\nwas low and quiet. \"He's writing a story, and he wants\nto be in love. He wants to know how it feels. He wanted\nme to tell you and see what you said.\"\n\nAgain Helen and Seth walked in silence. They came to\nthe garden surrounding the old Richmond place and going\nthrough a gap in the hedge sat on a wooden bench\nbeneath a bush.\n\nOn the street as he walked beside the girl new and\ndaring thoughts had come into Seth Richmond's mind. He\nbegan to regret his decision to get out of town. \"It\nwould be something new and altogether delightful to\nremain and walk often through the streets with Helen\nWhite,\" he thought. In imagination he saw himself\nputting his arm about her waist and feeling her arms\nclasped tightly about his neck. One of those odd\ncombinations of events and places made him connect the\nidea of love-making with this girl and a spot he had\nvisited some days before. He had gone on an errand to\nthe house of a farmer who lived on a hillside beyond\nthe Fair Ground and had returned by a path through a\nfield. At the foot of the hill below the farmer's house\nSeth had stopped beneath a sycamore tree and looked\nabout him. A soft humming noise had greeted his ears.\nFor a moment he had thought the tree must be the home\nof a swarm of bees.\n\nAnd then, looking down, Seth had seen the bees\neverywhere all about him in the long grass. He stood in\na mass of weeds that grew waist-high in the field that\nran away from the hillside. The weeds were abloom with\ntiny purple blossoms and gave forth an overpowering\nfragrance. Upon the weeds the bees were gathered in\narmies, singing as they worked.\n\nSeth imagined himself lying on a summer evening, buried\ndeep among the weeds beneath the tree. Beside him, in\nthe scene built in his fancy, lay Helen White, her hand\nlying in his hand. A peculiar reluctance kept him from\nkissing her lips, but he felt he might have done that\nif he wished. Instead, he lay perfectly still, looking\nat her and listening to the army of bees that sang the\nsustained masterful song of labor above his head.\n\nOn the bench in the garden Seth stirred uneasily.\nReleasing the hand of the girl, he thrust his hands\ninto his trouser pockets. A desire to impress the mind\nof his companion with the importance of the resolution\nhe had made came over him and he nodded his head toward\nthe house. \"Mother'll make a fuss, I suppose,\" he\nwhispered. \"She hasn't thought at all about what I'm\ngoing to do in life. She thinks I'm going to stay on\nhere forever just being a boy.\"\n\nSeth's voice became charged with boyish earnestness.\n\"You see, I've got to strike out. I've got to get to\nwork. It's what I'm good for.\"\n\nHelen White was impressed. She nodded her head and a\nfeeling of admiration swept over her. \"This is as it\nshould be,\" she thought. \"This boy is not a boy at all,\nbut a strong, purposeful man.\" Certain vague desires\nthat had been invading her body were swept away and she\nsat up very straight on the bench. The thunder\ncontinued to rumble and flashes of heat lightning lit\nup the eastern sky. The garden that had been so\nmysterious and vast, a place that with Seth beside her\nmight have become the background for strange and\nwonderful adventures, now seemed no more than an\nordinary Winesburg back yard, quite definite and\nlimited in its outlines.\n\n\"What will you do up there?\" she whispered.\n\nSeth turned half around on the bench, striving to see\nher face in the darkness. He thought her infinitely\nmore sensible and straightforward than George Willard,\nand was glad he had come away from his friend. A\nfeeling of impatience with the town that had been in\nhis mind returned, and he tried to tell her of it.\n\"Everyone talks and talks,\" he began. \"I'm sick of it.\nI'll do something, get into some kind of work where\ntalk don't count. Maybe I'll just be a mechanic in a\nshop. I don't know. I guess I don't care much. I just\nwant to work and keep quiet. That's all I've got in my\nmind.\"\n\nSeth arose from the bench and put out his hand. He did\nnot want to bring the meeting to an end but could not\nthink of anything more to say. \"It's the last time\nwe'll see each other,\" he whispered.\n\nA wave of sentiment swept over Helen. Putting her hand\nupon Seth's shoulder, she started to draw his face down\ntoward her own upturned face. The act was one of pure\naffection and cutting regret that some vague adventure\nthat had been present in the spirit of the night would\nnow never be realized. \"I think I'd better be going\nalong,\" she said, letting her hand fall heavily to her\nside. A thought came to her. \"Don't you go with me; I\nwant to be alone,\" she said. \"You go and talk with your\nmother. You'd better do that now.\"\n\nSeth hesitated and, as he stood waiting, the girl\nturned and ran away through the hedge. A desire to run\nafter her came to him, but he only stood staring,\nperplexed and puzzled by her action as he had been\nperplexed and puzzled by all of the life of the town\nout of which she had come. Walking slowly toward the\nhouse, he stopped in the shadow of a large tree and\nlooked at his mother sitting by a lighted window busily\nsewing. The feeling of loneliness that had visited him\nearlier in the evening returned and colored his\nthoughts of the adventure through which he had just\npassed. \"Huh!\" he exclaimed, turning and staring in the\ndirection taken by Helen White. \"That's how things'll\nturn out. She'll be like the rest. I suppose she'll\nbegin now to look at me in a funny way.\" He looked at\nthe ground and pondered this thought. \"She'll be\nembarrassed and feel strange when I'm around,\" he\nwhispered to himself. \"That's how it'll be. That's how\neverything'll turn out. When it comes to loving\nsomeone, it won't never be me. It'll be someone\nelse--some fool--someone who talks a lot--someone like\nthat George Willard.\"\n\n\n\n\nTANDY\n\nUntil she was seven years old she lived in an old\nunpainted house on an unused road that led off Trunion\nPike. Her father gave her but little attention and her\nmother was dead. The father spent his time talking and\nthinking of religion. He proclaimed himself an agnostic\nand was so absorbed in destroying the ideas of God that\nhad crept into the minds of his neighbors that he never\nsaw God manifesting himself in the little child that,\nhalf forgotten, lived here and there on the bounty of\nher dead mother's relatives.\n\nA stranger came to Winesburg and saw in the child what\nthe father did not see. He was a tall, redhaired young\nman who was almost always drunk. Sometimes he sat in a\nchair before the New Willard House with Tom Hard, the\nfather. As Tom talked, declaring there could be no God,\nthe stranger smiled and winked at the bystanders. He\nand Tom became friends and were much together.\n\nThe stranger was the son of a rich merchant of\nCleveland and had come to Winesburg on a mission. He\nwanted to cure himself of the habit of drink, and\nthought that by escaping from his city associates and\nliving in a rural community he would have a better\nchance in the struggle with the appetite that was\ndestroying him.\n\nHis sojourn in Winesburg was not a success. The\ndullness of the passing hours led to his drinking\nharder than ever. But he did succeed in doing\nsomething. He gave a name rich with meaning to Tom\nHard's daughter.\n\nOne evening when he was recovering from a long debauch\nthe stranger came reeling along the main street of the\ntown. Tom Hard sat in a chair before the New Willard\nHouse with his daughter, then a child of five, on his\nknees. Beside him on the board sidewalk sat young\nGeorge Willard. The stranger dropped into a chair\nbeside them. His body shook and when he tried to talk\nhis voice trembled.\n\nIt was late evening and darkness lay over the town and\nover the railroad that ran along the foot of a little\nincline before the hotel. Somewhere in the distance,\noff to the west, there was a prolonged blast from the\nwhistle of a passenger engine. A dog that had been\nsleeping in the roadway arose and barked. The stranger\nbegan to babble and made a prophecy concerning the\nchild that lay in the arms of the agnostic.\n\n\"I came here to quit drinking,\" he said, and tears\nbegan to run down his cheeks. He did not look at Tom\nHard, but leaned forward and stared into the darkness\nas though seeing a vision. \"I ran away to the country\nto be cured, but I am not cured. There is a reason.\" He\nturned to look at the child who sat up very straight on\nher father's knee and returned the look.\n\nThe stranger touched Tom Hard on the arm. \"Drink is not\nthe only thing to which I am addicted,\" he said. \"There\nis something else. I am a lover and have not found my\nthing to love. That is a big point if you know enough\nto realize what I mean. It makes my destruction\ninevitable, you see. There are few who understand\nthat.\"\n\nThe stranger became silent and seemed overcome with\nsadness, but another blast from the whistle of the\npassenger engine aroused him. \"I have not lost faith. I\nproclaim that. I have only been brought to the place\nwhere I know my faith will not be realized,\" he\ndeclared hoarsely. He looked hard at the child and\nbegan to address her, paying no more attention to the\nfather. \"There is a woman coming,\" he said, and his\nvoice was now sharp and earnest. \"I have missed her,\nyou see. She did not come in my time. You may be the\nwoman. It would be like fate to let me stand in her\npresence once, on such an evening as this, when I have\ndestroyed myself with drink and she is as yet only a\nchild.\"\n\nThe shoulders of the stranger shook violently, and when\nhe tried to roll a cigarette the paper fell from his\ntrembling fingers. He grew angry and scolded. \"They\nthink it's easy to be a woman, to be loved, but I know\nbetter,\" he declared. Again he turned to the child. \"I\nunderstand,\" he cried. \"Perhaps of all men I alone\nunderstand.\"\n\nHis glance again wandered away to the darkened street.\n\"I know about her, although she has never crossed my\npath,\" he said softly. \"I know about her struggles and\nher defeats. It is because of her defeats that she is\nto me the lovely one. Out of her defeats has been born\na new quality in woman. I have a name for it. I call it\nTandy. I made up the name when I was a true dreamer and\nbefore my body became vile. It is the quality of being\nstrong to be loved. It is something men need from women\nand that they do not get.\"\n\nThe stranger arose and stood before Tom Hard. His body\nrocked back and forth and he seemed about to fall, but\ninstead he dropped to his knees on the sidewalk and\nraised the hands of the little girl to his drunken\nlips. He kissed them ecstatically. \"Be Tandy, little\none,\" he pleaded. \"Dare to be strong and courageous.\nThat is the road. Venture anything. Be brave enough to\ndare to be loved. Be something more than man or woman.\nBe Tandy.\"\n\nThe stranger arose and staggered off down the street.\nA day or two later he got aboard a train and returned\nto his home in Cleveland. On the summer evening, after\nthe talk before the hotel, Tom Hard took the girl child\nto the house of a relative where she had been invited\nto spend the night. As he went along in the darkness\nunder the trees he forgot the babbling voice of the\nstranger and his mind returned to the making of\narguments by which he might destroy men's faith in God.\nHe spoke his daughter's name and she began to weep.\n\n\"I don't want to be called that,\" she declared. \"I\nwant to be called Tandy--Tandy Hard.\" The child wept so\nbitterly that Tom Hard was touched and tried to comfort\nher. He stopped beneath a tree and, taking her into his\narms, began to caress her. \"Be good, now,\" he said\nsharply; but she would not be quieted. With childish\nabandon she gave herself over to grief, her voice\nbreaking the evening stillness of the street. \"I want\nto be Tandy. I want to be Tandy. I want to be Tandy\nHard,\" she cried, shaking her head and sobbing as\nthough her young strength were not enough to bear the\nvision the words of the drunkard had brought to her.\n\n\n\n\nTHE STRENGTH OF GOD\n\nThe Reverend Curtis Hartman was pastor of the\nPresbyterian Church of Winesburg, and had been in that\nposition ten years. He was forty years old, and by his\nnature very silent and reticent. To preach, standing in\nthe pulpit before the people, was always a hardship for\nhim and from Wednesday morning until Saturday evening\nhe thought of nothing but the two sermons that must be\npreached on Sunday. Early on Sunday morning he went\ninto a little room called a study in the bell tower of\nthe church and prayed. In his prayers there was one\nnote that always predominated. \"Give me strength and\ncourage for Thy work, O Lord!\" he pleaded, kneeling on\nthe bare floor and bowing his head in the presence of\nthe task that lay before him.\n\nThe Reverend Hartman was a tall man with a brown beard.\nHis wife, a stout, nervous woman, was the daughter of a\nmanufacturer of underwear at Cleveland, Ohio. The\nminister himself was rather a favorite in the town. The\nelders of the church liked him because he was quiet and\nunpretentious and Mrs. White, the banker's wife,\nthought him scholarly and refined.\n\nThe Presbyterian Church held itself somewhat aloof from\nthe other churches of Winesburg. It was larger and more\nimposing and its minister was better paid. He even had\na carriage of his own and on summer evenings sometimes\ndrove about town with his wife. Through Main Street and\nup and down Buckeye Street he went, bowing gravely to\nthe people, while his wife, afire with secret pride,\nlooked at him out of the corners of her eyes and\nworried lest the horse become frightened and run away.\n\nFor a good many years after he came to Winesburg things\nwent well with Curtis Hartman. He was not one to arouse\nkeen enthusiasm among the worshippers in his church but\non the other hand he made no enemies. In reality he was\nmuch in earnest and sometimes suffered prolonged\nperiods of remorse because he could not go crying the\nword of God in the highways and byways of the town. He\nwondered if the flame of the spirit really burned in\nhim and dreamed of a day when a strong sweet new\ncurrent of power would come like a great wind into his\nvoice and his soul and the people would tremble before\nthe spirit of God made manifest in him. \"I am a poor\nstick and that will never really happen to me,\" he\nmused dejectedly, and then a patient smile lit up his\nfeatures. \"Oh well, I suppose I'm doing well enough,\"\nhe added philosophically.\n\nThe room in the bell tower of the church, where on\nSunday mornings the minister prayed for an increase in\nhim of the power of God, had but one window. It was\nlong and narrow and swung outward on a hinge like a\ndoor. On the window, made of little leaded panes, was a\ndesign showing the Christ laying his hand upon the head\nof a child. One Sunday morning in the summer as he sat\nby his desk in the room with a large Bible opened\nbefore him, and the sheets of his sermon scattered\nabout, the minister was shocked to see, in the upper\nroom of the house next door, a woman lying in her bed\nand smoking a cigarette while she read a book. Curtis\nHartman went on tiptoe to the window and closed it\nsoftly. He was horror stricken at the thought of a\nwoman smoking and trembled also to think that his eyes,\njust raised from the pages of the book of God, had\nlooked upon the bare shoulders and white throat of a\nwoman. With his brain in a whirl he went down into the\npulpit and preached a long sermon without once thinking\nof his gestures or his voice. The sermon attracted\nunusual attention because of its power and clearness.\n\"I wonder if she is listening, if my voice is carrying\na message into her soul,\" he thought and began to hope\nthat on future Sunday mornings he might be able to say\nwords that would touch and awaken the woman apparently\nfar gone in secret sin.\n\nThe house next door to the Presbyterian Church, through\nthe windows of which the minister had seen the sight\nthat had so upset him, was occupied by two women. Aunt\nElizabeth Swift, a grey competent-looking widow with\nmoney in the Winesburg National Bank, lived there with\nher daughter Kate Swift, a school teacher. The school\nteacher was thirty years old and had a neat\ntrim-looking figure. She had few friends and bore a\nreputation of having a sharp tongue. When he began to\nthink about her, Curtis Hartman remembered that she had\nbeen to Europe and had lived for two years in New York\nCity. \"Perhaps after all her smoking means nothing,\" he\nthought. He began to remember that when he was a\nstudent in college and occasionally read novels, good\nalthough somewhat worldly women, had smoked through the\npages of a book that had once fallen into his hands.\nWith a rush of new determination he worked on his\nsermons all through the week and forgot, in his zeal to\nreach the ears and the soul of this new listener, both\nhis embarrassment in the pulpit and the necessity of\nprayer in the study on Sunday mornings.\n\nReverend Hartman's experience with women had been\nsomewhat limited. He was the son of a wagon maker from\nMuncie, Indiana, and had worked his way through\ncollege. The daughter of the underwear manufacturer had\nboarded in a house where he lived during his school\ndays and he had married her after a formal and\nprolonged courtship, carried on for the most part by\nthe girl herself. On his marriage day the underwear\nmanufacturer had given his daughter five thousand\ndollars and he promised to leave her at least twice\nthat amount in his will. The minister had thought\nhimself fortunate in marriage and had never permitted\nhimself to think of other women. He did not want to\nthink of other women. What he wanted was to do the work\nof God quietly and earnestly.\n\nIn the soul of the minister a struggle awoke. From\nwanting to reach the ears of Kate Swift, and through\nhis sermons to delve into her soul, he began to want\nalso to look again at the figure lying white and quiet\nin the bed. On a Sunday morning when he could not sleep\nbecause of his thoughts he arose and went to walk in\nthe streets. When he had gone along Main Street almost\nto the old Richmond place he stopped and picking up a\nstone rushed off to the room in the bell tower. With\nthe stone he broke out a corner of the window and then\nlocked the door and sat down at the desk before the\nopen Bible to wait. When the shade of the window to\nKate Swift's room was raised he could see, through the\nhole, directly into her bed, but she was not there. She\nalso had arisen and had gone for a walk and the hand\nthat raised the shade was the hand of Aunt Elizabeth\nSwift.\n\nThe minister almost wept with joy at this deliverance\nfrom the carnal desire to \"peep\" and went back to his\nown house praising God. In an ill moment he forgot,\nhowever, to stop the hole in the window. The piece of\nglass broken out at the corner of the window just\nnipped off the bare heel of the boy standing motionless\nand looking with rapt eyes into the face of the Christ.\n\nCurtis Hartman forgot his sermon on that Sunday\nmorning. He talked to his congregation and in his talk\nsaid that it was a mistake for people to think of their\nminister as a man set aside and intended by nature to\nlead a blameless life. \"Out of my own experience I know\nthat we, who are the ministers of God's word, are beset\nby the same temptations that assail you,\" he declared.\n\"I have been tempted and have surrendered to\ntemptation. It is only the hand of God, placed beneath\nmy head, that has raised me up. As he has raised me so\nalso will he raise you. Do not despair. In your hour of\nsin raise your eyes to the skies and you will be again\nand again saved.\"\n\nResolutely the minister put the thoughts of the woman\nin the bed out of his mind and began to be something\nlike a lover in the presence of his wife. One evening\nwhen they drove out together he turned the horse out of\nBuckeye Street and in the darkness on Gospel Hill,\nabove Waterworks Pond, put his arm about Sarah\nHartman's waist. When he had eaten breakfast in the\nmorning and was ready to retire to his study at the\nback of his house he went around the table and kissed\nhis wife on the cheek. When thoughts of Kate Swift came\ninto his head, he smiled and raised his eyes to the\nskies. \"Intercede for me, Master,\" he muttered, \"keep\nme in the narrow path intent on Thy work.\"\n\nAnd now began the real struggle in the soul of the\nbrown-bearded minister. By chance he discovered that\nKate Swift was in the habit of lying in her bed in the\nevenings and reading a book. A lamp stood on a table by\nthe side of the bed and the light streamed down upon\nher white shoulders and bare throat. On the evening\nwhen he made the discovery the minister sat at the desk\nin the dusty room from nine until after eleven and when\nher light was put out stumbled out of the church to\nspend two more hours walking and praying in the\nstreets. He did not want to kiss the shoulders and the\nthroat of Kate Swift and had not allowed his mind to\ndwell on such thoughts. He did not know what he wanted.\n\"I am God's child and he must save me from myself,\" he\ncried, in the darkness under the trees as he wandered\nin the streets. By a tree he stood and looked at the\nsky that was covered with hurrying clouds. He began to\ntalk to God intimately and closely. \"Please, Father, do\nnot forget me. Give me power to go tomorrow and repair\nthe hole in the window. Lift my eyes again to the\nskies. Stay with me, Thy servant, in his hour of need.\"\n\nUp and down through the silent streets walked the\nminister and for days and weeks his soul was troubled.\nHe could not understand the temptation that had come to\nhim nor could he fathom the reason for its coming. In a\nway he began to blame God, saying to himself that he\nhad tried to keep his feet in the true path and had not\nrun about seeking sin. \"Through my days as a young man\nand all through my life here I have gone quietly about\nmy work,\" he declared. \"Why now should I be tempted?\nWhat have I done that this burden should be laid on\nme?\"\n\nThree times during the early fall and winter of that\nyear Curtis Hartman crept out of his house to the room\nin the bell tower to sit in the darkness looking at the\nfigure of Kate Swift lying in her bed and later went to\nwalk and pray in the streets. He could not understand\nhimself. For weeks he would go along scarcely thinking\nof the school teacher and telling himself that he had\nconquered the carnal desire to look at her body. And\nthen something would happen. As he sat in the study of\nhis own house, hard at work on a sermon, he would\nbecome nervous and begin to walk up and down the room.\n\"I will go out into the streets,\" he told himself and\neven as he let himself in at the church door he\npersistently denied to himself the cause of his being\nthere. \"I will not repair the hole in the window and I\nwill train myself to come here at night and sit in the\npresence of this woman without raising my eyes. I will\nnot be defeated in this thing. The Lord has devised\nthis temptation as a test of my soul and I will grope\nmy way out of darkness into the light of\nrighteousness.\"\n\nOne night in January when it was bitter cold and snow\nlay deep on the streets of Winesburg Curtis Hartman\npaid his last visit to the room in the bell tower of\nthe church. It was past nine o'clock when he left his\nown house and he set out so hurriedly that he forgot to\nput on his overshoes. In Main Street no one was abroad\nbut Hop Higgins the night watchman and in the whole\ntown no one was awake but the watchman and young George\nWillard, who sat in the office of the Winesburg Eagle\ntrying to write a story. Along the street to the church\nwent the minister, plowing through the drifts and\nthinking that this time he would utterly give way to\nsin. \"I want to look at the woman and to think of\nkissing her shoulders and I am going to let myself\nthink what I choose,\" he declared bitterly and tears\ncame into his eyes. He began to think that he would get\nout of the ministry and try some other way of life. \"I\nshall go to some city and get into business,\" he\ndeclared. \"If my nature is such that I cannot resist\nsin, I shall give myself over to sin. At least I shall\nnot be a hypocrite, preaching the word of God with my\nmind thinking of the shoulders and neck of a woman who\ndoes not belong to me.\"\n\nIt was cold in the room of the bell tower of the church\non that January night and almost as soon as he came\ninto the room Curtis Hartman knew that if he stayed he\nwould be ill. His feet were wet from tramping in the\nsnow and there was no fire. In the room in the house\nnext door Kate Swift had not yet appeared. With grim\ndetermination the man sat down to wait. Sitting in the\nchair and gripping the edge of the desk on which lay\nthe Bible he stared into the darkness thinking the\nblackest thoughts of his life. He thought of his wife\nand for the moment almost hated her. \"She has always\nbeen ashamed of passion and has cheated me,\" he\nthought. \"Man has a right to expect living passion and\nbeauty in a woman. He has no right to forget that he is\nan animal and in me there is something that is Greek. I\nwill throw off the woman of my bosom and seek other\nwomen. I will besiege this school teacher. I will fly\nin the face of all men and if I am a creature of carnal\nlusts I will live then for my lusts.\"\n\nThe distracted man trembled from head to foot, partly\nfrom cold, partly from the struggle in which he was\nengaged. Hours passed and a fever assailed his body.\nHis throat began to hurt and his teeth chattered. His\nfeet on the study floor felt like two cakes of ice.\nStill he would not give up. \"I will see this woman and\nwill think the thoughts I have never dared to think,\"\nhe told himself, gripping the edge of the desk and\nwaiting.\n\nCurtis Hartman came near dying from the effects of that\nnight of waiting in the church, and also he found in\nthe thing that happened what he took to be the way of\nlife for him. On other evenings when he had waited he\nhad not been able to see, through the little hole in\nthe glass, any part of the school teacher's room except\nthat occupied by her bed. In the darkness he had waited\nuntil the woman suddenly appeared sitting in the bed in\nher white nightrobe. When the light was turned up she\npropped herself up among the pillows and read a book.\nSometimes she smoked one of the cigarettes. Only her\nbare shoulders and throat were visible.\n\nOn the January night, after he had come near dying with\ncold and after his mind had two or three times actually\nslipped away into an odd land of fantasy so that he had\nby an exercise of will power to force himself back into\nconsciousness, Kate Swift appeared. In the room next\ndoor a lamp was lighted and the waiting man stared into\nan empty bed. Then upon the bed before his eyes a naked\nwoman threw herself. Lying face downward she wept and\nbeat with her fists upon the pillow. With a final\noutburst of weeping she half arose, and in the presence\nof the man who had waited to look and not to think\nthoughts the woman of sin began to pray. In the\nlamplight her figure, slim and strong, looked like the\nfigure of the boy in the presence of the Christ on the\nleaded window.\n\nCurtis Hartman never remembered how he got out of the\nchurch. With a cry he arose, dragging the heavy desk\nalong the floor. The Bible fell, making a great clatter\nin the silence. When the light in the house next door\nwent out he stumbled down the stairway and into the\nstreet. Along the street he went and ran in at the door\nof the Winesburg Eagle. To George Willard, who was\ntramping up and down in the office undergoing a\nstruggle of his own, he began to talk half\nincoherently. \"The ways of God are beyond human\nunderstanding,\" he cried, running in quickly and\nclosing the door. He began to advance upon the young\nman, his eyes glowing and his voice ringing with\nfervor. \"I have found the light,\" he cried. \"After ten\nyears in this town, God has manifested himself to me in\nthe body of a woman.\" His voice dropped and he began to\nwhisper. \"I did not understand,\" he said. \"What I took\nto be a trial of my soul was only a preparation for a\nnew and more beautiful fervor of the spirit. God has\nappeared to me in the person of Kate Swift, the school\nteacher, kneeling naked on a bed. Do you know Kate\nSwift? Although she may not be aware of it, she is an\ninstrument of God, bearing the message of truth.\"\n\nReverend Curtis Hartman turned and ran out of the\noffice. At the door he stopped, and after looking up\nand down the deserted street, turned again to George\nWillard. \"I am delivered. Have no fear.\" He held up a\nbleeding fist for the young man to see. \"I smashed the\nglass of the window,\" he cried. \"Now it will have to be\nwholly replaced. The strength of God was in me and I\nbroke it with my fist.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE TEACHER\n\nSnow lay deep in the streets of Winesburg. It had\nbegun to snow about ten o'clock in the morning and a\nwind sprang up and blew the snow in clouds along Main\nStreet. The frozen mud roads that led into town were\nfairly smooth and in places ice covered the mud. \"There\nwill be good sleighing,\" said Will Henderson, standing\nby the bar in Ed Griffith's saloon. Out of the saloon\nhe went and met Sylvester West the druggist stumbling\nalong in the kind of heavy overshoes called arctics.\n\"Snow will bring the people into town on Saturday,\"\nsaid the druggist. The two men stopped and discussed\ntheir affairs. Will Henderson, who had on a light\novercoat and no overshoes, kicked the heel of his left\nfoot with the toe of the right. \"Snow will be good for\nthe wheat,\" observed the druggist sagely.\n\nYoung George Willard, who had nothing to do, was glad\nbecause he did not feel like working that day. The\nweekly paper had been printed and taken to the post\noffice Wednesday evening and the snow began to fall on\nThursday. At eight o'clock, after the morning train had\npassed, he put a pair of skates in his pocket and went\nup to Waterworks Pond but did not go skating. Past the\npond and along a path that followed Wine Creek he went\nuntil he came to a grove of beech trees. There he built\na fire against the side of a log and sat down at the\nend of the log to think. When the snow began to fall\nand the wind to blow he hurried about getting fuel for\nthe fire.\n\nThe young reporter was thinking of Kate Swift, who had\nonce been his school teacher. On the evening before he\nhad gone to her house to get a book she wanted him to\nread and had been alone with her for an hour. For the\nfourth or fifth time the woman had talked to him with\ngreat earnestness and he could not make out what she\nmeant by her talk. He began to believe she must be in\nlove with him and the thought was both pleasing and\nannoying.\n\nUp from the log he sprang and began to pile sticks on\nthe fire. Looking about to be sure he was alone he\ntalked aloud pretending he was in the presence of the\nwoman, \"Oh, you're just letting on, you know you are,\"\nhe declared. \"I am going to find out about you. You\nwait and see.\"\n\nThe young man got up and went back along the path\ntoward town leaving the fire blazing in the wood. As he\nwent through the streets the skates clanked in his\npocket. In his own room in the New Willard House he\nbuilt a fire in the stove and lay down on top of the\nbed. He began to have lustful thoughts and pulling down\nthe shade of the window closed his eyes and turned his\nface to the wall. He took a pillow into his arms and\nembraced it thinking first of the school teacher, who\nby her words had stirred something within him, and\nlater of Helen White, the slim daughter of the town\nbanker, with whom he had been for a long time half in\nlove.\n\nBy nine o'clock of that evening snow lay deep in the\nstreets and the weather had become bitter cold. It was\ndifficult to walk about. The stores were dark and the\npeople had crawled away to their houses. The evening\ntrain from Cleveland was very late but nobody was\ninterested in its arrival. By ten o'clock all but four\nof the eighteen hundred citizens of the town were in\nbed.\n\nHop Higgins, the night watchman, was partially awake.\nHe was lame and carried a heavy stick. On dark nights\nhe carried a lantern. Between nine and ten o'clock he\nwent his rounds. Up and down Main Street he stumbled\nthrough the drifts trying the doors of the stores. Then\nhe went into alleyways and tried the back doors.\nFinding all tight he hurried around the corner to the\nNew Willard House and beat on the door. Through the\nrest of the night he intended to stay by the stove.\n\"You go to bed. I'll keep the stove going,\" he said to\nthe boy who slept on a cot in the hotel office.\n\nHop Higgins sat down by the stove and took off his\nshoes. When the boy had gone to sleep he began to think\nof his own affairs. He intended to paint his house in\nthe spring and sat by the stove calculating the cost of\npaint and labor. That led him into other calculations.\nThe night watchman was sixty years old and wanted to\nretire. He had been a soldier in the Civil War and drew\na small pension. He hoped to find some new method of\nmaking a living and aspired to become a professional\nbreeder of ferrets. Already he had four of the\nstrangely shaped savage little creatures, that are used\nby sportsmen in the pursuit of rabbits, in the cellar\nof his house. \"Now I have one male and three females,\"\nhe mused. \"If I am lucky by spring I shall have twelve\nor fifteen. In another year I shall be able to begin\nadvertising ferrets for sale in the sporting papers.\"\n\nThe nightwatchman settled into his chair and his mind\nbecame a blank. He did not sleep. By years of practice\nhe had trained himself to sit for hours through the\nlong nights neither asleep nor awake. In the morning he\nwas almost as refreshed as though he had slept.\n\nWith Hop Higgins safely stowed away in the chair behind\nthe stove only three people were awake in Winesburg.\nGeorge Willard was in the office of the Eagle\npretending to be at work on the writing of a story but\nin reality continuing the mood of the morning by the\nfire in the wood. In the bell tower of the Presbyterian\nChurch the Reverend Curtis Hartman was sitting in the\ndarkness preparing himself for a revelation from God,\nand Kate Swift, the school teacher, was leaving her\nhouse for a walk in the storm.\n\nIt was past ten o'clock when Kate Swift set out and the\nwalk was unpremeditated. It was as though the man and\nthe boy, by thinking of her, had driven her forth into\nthe wintry streets. Aunt Elizabeth Swift had gone to\nthe county seat concerning some business in connection\nwith mortgages in which she had money invested and\nwould not be back until the next day. By a huge stove,\ncalled a base burner, in the living room of the house\nsat the daughter reading a book. Suddenly she sprang to\nher feet and, snatching a cloak from a rack by the\nfront door, ran out of the house.\n\nAt the age of thirty Kate Swift was not known in\nWinesburg as a pretty woman. Her complexion was not\ngood and her face was covered with blotches that\nindicated ill health. Alone in the night in the winter\nstreets she was lovely. Her back was straight, her\nshoulders square, and her features were as the features\nof a tiny goddess on a pedestal in a garden in the dim\nlight of a summer evening.\n\nDuring the afternoon the school teacher had been to see\nDoctor Welling concerning her health. The doctor had\nscolded her and had declared she was in danger of\nlosing her hearing. It was foolish for Kate Swift to be\nabroad in the storm, foolish and perhaps dangerous.\n\nThe woman in the streets did not remember the words of\nthe doctor and would not have turned back had she\nremembered. She was very cold but after walking for\nfive minutes no longer minded the cold. First she went\nto the end of her own street and then across a pair of\nhay scales set in the ground before a feed barn and\ninto Trunion Pike. Along Trunion Pike she went to Ned\nWinters' barn and turning east followed a street of low\nframe houses that led over Gospel Hill and into Sucker\nRoad that ran down a shallow valley past Ike Smead's\nchicken farm to Waterworks Pond. As she went along, the\nbold, excited mood that had driven her out of doors\npassed and then returned again.\n\nThere was something biting and forbidding in the\ncharacter of Kate Swift. Everyone felt it. In the\nschoolroom she was silent, cold, and stern, and yet in\nan odd way very close to her pupils. Once in a long\nwhile something seemed to have come over her and she\nwas happy. All of the children in the schoolroom felt\nthe effect of her happiness. For a time they did not\nwork but sat back in their chairs and looked at her.\n\nWith hands clasped behind her back the school teacher\nwalked up and down in the schoolroom and talked very\nrapidly. It did not seem to matter what subject came\ninto her mind. Once she talked to the children of\nCharles Lamb and made up strange, intimate little\nstories concerning the life of the dead writer. The\nstories were told with the air of one who had lived in\na house with Charles Lamb and knew all the secrets of\nhis private life. The children were somewhat confused,\nthinking Charles Lamb must be someone who had once\nlived in Winesburg.\n\nOn another occasion the teacher talked to the children\nof Benvenuto Cellini. That time they laughed. What a\nbragging, blustering, brave, lovable fellow she made of\nthe old artist! Concerning him also she invented\nanecdotes. There was one of a German music teacher who\nhad a room above Cellini's lodgings in the city of\nMilan that made the boys guffaw. Sugars McNutts, a fat\nboy with red cheeks, laughed so hard that he became\ndizzy and fell off his seat and Kate Swift laughed with\nhim. Then suddenly she became again cold and stern.\n\nOn the winter night when she walked through the\ndeserted snow-covered streets, a crisis had come into\nthe life of the school teacher. Although no one in\nWinesburg would have suspected it, her life had been\nvery adventurous. It was still adventurous. Day by day\nas she worked in the schoolroom or walked in the\nstreets, grief, hope, and desire fought within her.\nBehind a cold exterior the most extraordinary events\ntranspired in her mind. The people of the town thought\nof her as a confirmed old maid and because she spoke\nsharply and went her own way thought her lacking in all\nthe human feeling that did so much to make and mar\ntheir own lives. In reality she was the most eagerly\npassionate soul among them, and more than once, in the\nfive years since she had come back from her travels to\nsettle in Winesburg and become a school teacher, had\nbeen compelled to go out of the house and walk half\nthrough the night fighting out some battle raging\nwithin. Once on a night when it rained she had stayed\nout six hours and when she came home had a quarrel with\nAunt Elizabeth Swift. \"I am glad you're not a man,\"\nsaid the mother sharply. \"More than once I've waited\nfor your father to come home, not knowing what new mess\nhe had got into. I've had my share of uncertainty and\nyou cannot blame me if I do not want to see the worst\nside of him reproduced in you.\"\n\n            *       *       *\n\nKate Swift's mind was ablaze with thoughts of George\nWillard. In something he had written as a school boy\nshe thought she had recognized the spark of genius and\nwanted to blow on the spark. One day in the summer she\nhad gone to the Eagle office and finding the boy\nunoccupied had taken him out Main Street to the Fair\nGround, where the two sat on a grassy bank and talked.\nThe school teacher tried to bring home to the mind of\nthe boy some conception of the difficulties he would\nhave to face as a writer. \"You will have to know life,\"\nshe declared, and her voice trembled with earnestness.\nShe took hold of George Willard's shoulders and turned\nhim about so that she could look into his eyes. A\npasser-by might have thought them about to embrace. \"If\nyou are to become a writer you'll have to stop fooling\nwith words,\" she explained. \"It would be better to give\nup the notion of writing until you are better prepared.\nNow it's time to be living. I don't want to frighten\nyou, but I would like to make you understand the import\nof what you think of attempting. You must not become a\nmere peddler of words. The thing to learn is to know\nwhat people are thinking about, not what they say.\"\n\nOn the evening before that stormy Thursday night when\nthe Reverend Curtis Hartman sat in the bell tower of\nthe church waiting to look at her body, young Willard\nhad gone to visit the teacher and to borrow a book. It\nwas then the thing happened that confused and puzzled\nthe boy. He had the book under his arm and was\npreparing to depart. Again Kate Swift talked with great\nearnestness. Night was coming on and the light in the\nroom grew dim. As he turned to go she spoke his name\nsoftly and with an impulsive movement took hold of his\nhand. Because the reporter was rapidly becoming a man\nsomething of his man's appeal, combined with the\nwinsomeness of the boy, stirred the heart of the lonely\nwoman. A passionate desire to have him understand the\nimport of life, to learn to interpret it truly and\nhonestly, swept over her. Leaning forward, her lips\nbrushed his cheek. At the same moment he for the first\ntime became aware of the marked beauty of her features.\nThey were both embarrassed, and to relieve her feeling\nshe became harsh and domineering. \"What's the use? It\nwill be ten years before you begin to understand what I\nmean when I talk to you,\" she cried passionately.\n\n            *       *       *\n\nOn the night of the storm and while the minister sat in\nthe church waiting for her, Kate Swift went to the\noffice of the Winesburg Eagle, intending to have\nanother talk with the boy. After the long walk in the\nsnow she was cold, lonely, and tired. As she came\nthrough Main Street she saw the light from the\nprintshop window shining on the snow and on an impulse\nopened the door and went in. For an hour she sat by the\nstove in the office talking of life. She talked with\npassionate earnestness. The impulse that had driven her\nout into the snow poured itself out into talk. She\nbecame inspired as she sometimes did in the presence of\nthe children in school. A great eagerness to open the\ndoor of life to the boy, who had been her pupil and who\nshe thought might possess a talent for the\nunderstanding of life, had possession of her. So strong\nwas her passion that it became something physical.\nAgain her hands took hold of his shoulders and she\nturned him about. In the dim light her eyes blazed. She\narose and laughed, not sharply as was customary with\nher, but in a queer, hesitating way. \"I must be going,\"\nshe said. \"In a moment, if I stay, I'll be wanting to\nkiss you.\"\n\nIn the newspaper office a confusion arose. Kate Swift\nturned and walked to the door. She was a teacher but\nshe was also a woman. As she looked at George Willard,\nthe passionate desire to be loved by a man, that had a\nthousand times before swept like a storm over her body,\ntook possession of her. In the lamplight George Willard\nlooked no longer a boy, but a man ready to play the\npart of a man.\n\nThe school teacher let George Willard take her into his\narms. In the warm little office the air became suddenly\nheavy and the strength went out of her body. Leaning\nagainst a low counter by the door she waited. When he\ncame and put a hand on her shoulder she turned and let\nher body fall heavily against him. For George Willard\nthe confusion was immediately increased. For a moment\nhe held the body of the woman tightly against his body\nand then it stiffened. Two sharp little fists began to\nbeat on his face. When the school teacher had run away\nand left him alone, he walked up and down the office\nswearing furiously.\n\nIt was into this confusion that the Reverend Curtis\nHartman protruded himself. When he came in George\nWillard thought the town had gone mad. Shaking a\nbleeding fist in the air, the minister proclaimed the\nwoman George had only a moment before held in his arms\nan instrument of God bearing a message of truth.\n\n            *       *       *\n\nGeorge blew out the lamp by the window and locking the\ndoor of the printshop went home. Through the hotel\noffice, past Hop Higgins lost in his dream of the\nraising of ferrets, he went and up into his own room.\nThe fire in the stove had gone out and he undressed in\nthe cold. When he got into bed the sheets were like\nblankets of dry snow.\n\nGeorge Willard rolled about in the bed on which he had\nlain in the afternoon hugging the pillow and thinking\nthoughts of Kate Swift. The words of the minister, who\nhe thought had gone suddenly insane, rang in his ears.\nHis eyes stared about the room. The resentment, natural\nto the baffled male, passed and he tried to understand\nwhat had happened. He could not make it out. Over and\nover he turned the matter in his mind. Hours passed and\nhe began to think it must be time for another day to\ncome. At four o'clock he pulled the covers up about his\nneck and tried to sleep. When he became drowsy and\nclosed his eyes, he raised a hand and with it groped\nabout in the darkness. \"I have missed something. I have\nmissed something Kate Swift was trying to tell me,\" he\nmuttered sleepily. Then he slept and in all Winesburg\nhe was the last soul on that winter night to go to\nsleep.\n\n\n\n\nLONELINESS\n\nHe was the son of Mrs. Al Robinson who once owned a\nfarm on a side road leading off Trunion Pike, east of\nWinesburg and two miles beyond the town limits. The\nfarmhouse was painted brown and the blinds to all of\nthe windows facing the road were kept closed. In the\nroad before the house a flock of chickens, accompanied\nby two guinea hens, lay in the deep dust. Enoch lived\nin the house with his mother in those days and when he\nwas a young boy went to school at the Winesburg High\nSchool. Old citizens remembered him as a quiet, smiling\nyouth inclined to silence. He walked in the middle of\nthe road when he came into town and sometimes read a\nbook. Drivers of teams had to shout and swear to make\nhim realize where he was so that he would turn out of\nthe beaten track and let them pass.\n\nWhen he was twenty-one years old Enoch went to New York\nCity and was a city man for fifteen years. He studied\nFrench and went to an art school, hoping to develop a\nfaculty he had for drawing. In his own mind he planned\nto go to Paris and to finish his art education among\nthe masters there, but that never turned out.\n\nNothing ever turned out for Enoch Robinson. He could\ndraw well enough and he had many odd delicate thoughts\nhidden away in his brain that might have expressed\nthemselves through the brush of a painter, but he was\nalways a child and that was a handicap to his worldly\ndevelopment. He never grew up and of course he couldn't\nunderstand people and he couldn't make people\nunderstand him. The child in him kept bumping against\nthings, against actualities like money and sex and\nopinions. Once he was hit by a street car and thrown\nagainst an iron post. That made him lame. It was one of\nthe many things that kept things from turning out for\nEnoch Robinson.\n\nIn New York City, when he first went there to live and\nbefore he became confused and disconcerted by the facts\nof life, Enoch went about a good deal with young men.\nHe got into a group of other young artists, both men\nand women, and in the evenings they sometimes came to\nvisit him in his room. Once he got drunk and was taken\nto a police station where a police magistrate\nfrightened him horribly, and once he tried to have an\naffair with a woman of the town met on the sidewalk\nbefore his lodging house. The woman and Enoch walked\ntogether three blocks and then the young man grew\nafraid and ran away. The woman had been drinking and\nthe incident amused her. She leaned against the wall of\na building and laughed so heartily that another man\nstopped and laughed with her. The two went away\ntogether, still laughing, and Enoch crept off to his\nroom trembling and vexed.\n\nThe room in which young Robinson lived in New York\nfaced Washington Square and was long and narrow like a\nhallway. It is important to get that fixed in your\nmind. The story of Enoch is in fact the story of a room\nalmost more than it is the story of a man.\n\nAnd so into the room in the evening came young Enoch's\nfriends. There was nothing particularly striking about\nthem except that they were artists of the kind that\ntalk. Everyone knows of the talking artists. Throughout\nall of the known history of the world they have\ngathered in rooms and talked. They talk of art and are\npassionately, almost feverishly, in earnest about it.\nThey think it matters much more than it does.\n\nAnd so these people gathered and smoked cigarettes and\ntalked and Enoch Robinson, the boy from the farm near\nWinesburg, was there. He stayed in a corner and for the\nmost part said nothing. How his big blue childlike eyes\nstared about! On the walls were pictures he had made,\ncrude things, half finished. His friends talked of\nthese. Leaning back in their chairs, they talked and\ntalked with their heads rocking from side to side.\nWords were said about line and values and composition,\nlots of words, such as are always being said.\n\nEnoch wanted to talk too but he didn't know how. He was\ntoo excited to talk coherently. When he tried he\nsputtered and stammered and his voice sounded strange\nand squeaky to him. That made him stop talking. He knew\nwhat he wanted to say, but he knew also that he could\nnever by any possibility say it. When a picture he had\npainted was under discussion, he wanted to burst out\nwith something like this: \"You don't get the point,\" he\nwanted to explain; \"the picture you see doesn't consist\nof the things you see and say words about. There is\nsomething else, something you don't see at all,\nsomething you aren't intended to see. Look at this one\nover here, by the door here, where the light from the\nwindow falls on it. The dark spot by the road that you\nmight not notice at all is, you see, the beginning of\neverything. There is a clump of elders there such as\nused to grow beside the road before our house back in\nWinesburg, Ohio, and in among the elders there is\nsomething hidden. It is a woman, that's what it is. She\nhas been thrown from a horse and the horse has run away\nout of sight. Do you not see how the old man who drives\na cart looks anxiously about? That is Thad Grayback who\nhas a farm up the road. He is taking corn to Winesburg\nto be ground into meal at Comstock's mill. He knows\nthere is something in the elders, something hidden\naway, and yet he doesn't quite know.\n\n\"It's a woman you see, that's what it is! It's a woman\nand, oh, she is lovely! She is hurt and is suffering\nbut she makes no sound. Don't you see how it is? She\nlies quite still, white and still, and the beauty comes\nout from her and spreads over everything. It is in the\nsky back there and all around everywhere. I didn't try\nto paint the woman, of course. She is too beautiful to\nbe painted. How dull to talk of composition and such\nthings! Why do you not look at the sky and then run\naway as I used to do when I was a boy back there in\nWinesburg, Ohio?\"\n\nThat is the kind of thing young Enoch Robinson trembled\nto say to the guests who came into his room when he was\na young fellow in New York City, but he always ended by\nsaying nothing. Then he began to doubt his own mind. He\nwas afraid the things he felt were not getting\nexpressed in the pictures he painted. In a half\nindignant mood he stopped inviting people into his room\nand presently got into the habit of locking the door.\nHe began to think that enough people had visited him,\nthat he did not need people any more. With quick\nimagination he began to invent his own people to whom\nhe could really talk and to whom he explained the\nthings he had been unable to explain to living people.\nHis room began to be inhabited by the spirits of men\nand women among whom he went, in his turn saying words.\nIt was as though everyone Enoch Robinson had ever seen\nhad left with him some essence of himself, something he\ncould mould and change to suit his own fancy, something\nthat understood all about such things as the wounded\nwoman behind the elders in the pictures.\n\nThe mild, blue-eyed young Ohio boy was a complete\negotist, as all children are egotists. He did not want\nfriends for the quite simple reason that no child wants\nfriends. He wanted most of all the people of his own\nmind, people with whom he could really talk, people he\ncould harangue and scold by the hour, servants, you\nsee, to his fancy. Among these people he was always\nself-confident and bold. They might talk, to be sure,\nand even have opinions of their own, but always he\ntalked last and best. He was like a writer busy among\nthe figures of his brain, a kind of tiny blue-eyed king\nhe was, in a six-dollar room facing Washington Square in\nthe city of New York.\n\nThen Enoch Robinson got married. He began to get\nlonely and to want to touch actual flesh-and-bone\npeople with his hands. Days passed when his room seemed\nempty. Lust visited his body and desire grew in his\nmind. At night strange fevers, burning within, kept him\nawake. He married a girl who sat in a chair next to his\nown in the art school and went to live in an apartment\nhouse in Brooklyn. Two children were born to the woman\nhe married, and Enoch got a job in a place where\nillustrations are made for advertisements.\n\nThat began another phase of Enoch's life. He began to\nplay at a new game. For a while he was very proud of\nhimself in the role of producing citizen of the world.\nHe dismissed the essence of things and played with\nrealities. In the fall he voted at an election and he\nhad a newspaper thrown on his porch each morning. When\nin the evening he came home from work he got off a\nstreetcar and walked sedately along behind some\nbusiness man, striving to look very substantial and\nimportant. As a payer of taxes he thought he should\npost himself on how things are run. \"I'm getting to be\nof some moment, a real part of things, of the state and\nthe city and all that,\" he told himself with an amusing\nminiature air of dignity. Once, coming home from\nPhiladelphia, he had a discussion with a man met on a\ntrain. Enoch talked about the advisability of the\ngovernment's owning and operating the railroads and the\nman gave him a cigar. It was Enoch's notion that such a\nmove on the part of the government would be a good\nthing, and he grew quite excited as he talked. Later he\nremembered his own words with pleasure. \"I gave him\nsomething to think about, that fellow,\" he muttered to\nhimself as he climbed the stairs to his Brooklyn\napartment.\n\nTo be sure, Enoch's marriage did not turn out. He\nhimself brought it to an end. He began to feel choked\nand walled in by the life in the apartment, and to feel\ntoward his wife and even toward his children as he had\nfelt concerning the friends who once came to visit him.\nHe began to tell little lies about business engagements\nthat would give him freedom to walk alone in the street\nat night and, the chance offering, he secretly\nre-rented the room facing Washington Square. Then Mrs.\nAl Robinson died on the farm near Winesburg, and he got\neight thousand dollars from the bank that acted as\ntrustee of her estate. That took Enoch out of the world\nof men altogether. He gave the money to his wife and\ntold her he could not live in the apartment any more.\nShe cried and was angry and threatened, but he only\nstared at her and went his own way. In reality the wife\ndid not care much. She thought Enoch slightly insane\nand was a little afraid of him. When it was quite sure\nthat he would never come back, she took the two\nchildren and went to a village in Connecticut where she\nhad lived as a girl. In the end she married a man who\nbought and sold real estate and was contented enough.\n\nAnd so Enoch Robinson stayed in the New York room among\nthe people of his fancy, playing with them, talking to\nthem, happy as a child is happy. They were an odd lot,\nEnoch's people. They were made, I suppose, out of real\npeople he had seen and who had for some obscure reason\nmade an appeal to him. There was a woman with a sword\nin her hand, an old man with a long white beard who\nwent about followed by a dog, a young girl whose\nstockings were always coming down and hanging over her\nshoe tops. There must have been two dozen of the shadow\npeople, invented by the child-mind of Enoch Robinson,\nwho lived in the room with him.\n\nAnd Enoch was happy. Into the room he went and locked\nthe door. With an absurd air of importance he talked\naloud, giving instructions, making comments on life. He\nwas happy and satisfied to go on making his living in\nthe advertising place until something happened. Of\ncourse something did happen. That is why he went back\nto live in Winesburg and why we know about him. The\nthing that happened was a woman. It would be that way.\nHe was too happy. Something had to come into his world.\nSomething had to drive him out of the New York room to\nlive out his life an obscure, jerky little figure,\nbobbing up and down on the streets of an Ohio town at\nevening when the sun was going down behind the roof of\nWesley Moyer's livery barn.\n\nAbout the thing that happened. Enoch told George\nWillard about it one night. He wanted to talk to\nsomeone, and he chose the young newspaper reporter\nbecause the two happened to be thrown together at a\ntime when the younger man was in a mood to understand.\n\nYouthful sadness, young man's sadness, the sadness of a\ngrowing boy in a village at the year's end, opened the\nlips of the old man. The sadness was in the heart of\nGeorge Willard and was without meaning, but it appealed\nto Enoch Robinson.\n\nIt rained on the evening when the two met and talked, a\ndrizzly wet October rain. The fruition of the year had\ncome and the night should have been fine with a moon in\nthe sky and the crisp sharp promise of frost in the\nair, but it wasn't that way. It rained and little\npuddles of water shone under the street lamps on Main\nStreet. In the woods in the darkness beyond the Fair\nGround water dripped from the black trees. Beneath the\ntrees wet leaves were pasted against tree roots that\nprotruded from the ground. In gardens back of houses in\nWinesburg dry shriveled potato vines lay sprawling on\nthe ground. Men who had finished the evening meal and\nwho had planned to go uptown to talk the evening away\nwith other men at the back of some store changed their\nminds. George Willard tramped about in the rain and was\nglad that it rained. He felt that way. He was like\nEnoch Robinson on the evenings when the old man came\ndown out of his room and wandered alone in the streets.\nHe was like that only that George Willard had become a\ntall young man and did not think it manly to weep and\ncarry on. For a month his mother had been very ill and\nthat had something to do with his sadness, but not\nmuch. He thought about himself and to the young that\nalways brings sadness.\n\nEnoch Robinson and George Willard met beneath a wooden\nawning that extended out over the sidewalk before\nVoight's wagon shop on Maumee Street just off the main\nstreet of Winesburg. They went together from there\nthrough the rain-washed streets to the older man's room\non the third floor of the Heffner Block. The young\nreporter went willingly enough. Enoch Robinson asked\nhim to go after the two had talked for ten minutes. The\nboy was a little afraid but had never been more curious\nin his life. A hundred times he had heard the old man\nspoken of as a little off his head and he thought\nhimself rather brave and manly to go at all. From the\nvery beginning, in the street in the rain, the old man\ntalked in a queer way, trying to tell the story of the\nroom in Washington Square and of his life in the room.\n\"You'll understand if you try hard enough,\" he said\nconclusively. \"I have looked at you when you went past\nme on the street and I think you can understand. It\nisn't hard. All you have to do is to believe what I\nsay, just listen and believe, that's all there is to\nit.\"\n\nIt was past eleven o'clock that evening when old Enoch,\ntalking to George Willard in the room in the Heffner\nBlock, came to the vital thing, the story of the woman\nand of what drove him out of the city to live out his\nlife alone and defeated in Winesburg. He sat on a cot\nby the window with his head in his hand and George\nWillard was in a chair by a table. A kerosene lamp sat\non the table and the room, although almost bare of\nfurniture, was scrupulously clean. As the man talked\nGeorge Willard began to feel that he would like to get\nout of the chair and sit on the cot also. He wanted to\nput his arms about the little old man. In the half\ndarkness the man talked and the boy listened, filled\nwith sadness.\n\n\"She got to coming in there after there hadn't been\nanyone in the room for years,\" said Enoch Robinson.\n\"She saw me in the hallway of the house and we got\nacquainted. I don't know just what she did in her own\nroom. I never went there. I think she was a musician\nand played a violin. Every now and then she came and\nknocked at the door and I opened it. In she came and\nsat down beside me, just sat and looked about and said\nnothing. Anyway, she said nothing that mattered.\"\n\nThe old man arose from the cot and moved about the\nroom. The overcoat he wore was wet from the rain and\ndrops of water kept falling with a soft thump on the\nfloor. When he again sat upon the cot George Willard\ngot out of the chair and sat beside him.\n\n\"I had a feeling about her. She sat there in the room\nwith me and she was too big for the room. I felt that\nshe was driving everything else away. We just talked of\nlittle things, but I couldn't sit still. I wanted to\ntouch her with my fingers and to kiss her. Her hands\nwere so strong and her face was so good and she looked\nat me all the time.\"\n\nThe trembling voice of the old man became silent and\nhis body shook as from a chill. \"I was afraid,\" he\nwhispered. \"I was terribly afraid. I didn't want to let\nher come in when she knocked at the door but I couldn't\nsit still. 'No, no,' I said to myself, but I got up and\nopened the door just the same. She was so grown up, you\nsee. She was a woman. I thought she would be bigger\nthan I was there in that room.\"\n\nEnoch Robinson stared at George Willard, his childlike\nblue eyes shining in the lamplight. Again he shivered.\n\"I wanted her and all the time I didn't want her,\" he\nexplained. \"Then I began to tell her about my people,\nabout everything that meant anything to me. I tried to\nkeep quiet, to keep myself to myself, but I couldn't. I\nfelt just as I did about opening the door. Sometimes I\nached to have her go away and never come back any\nmore.\"\n\nThe old man sprang to his feet and his voice shook with\nexcitement. \"One night something happened. I became mad\nto make her understand me and to know what a big thing\nI was in that room. I wanted her to see how important I\nwas. I told her over and over. When she tried to go\naway, I ran and locked the door. I followed her about.\nI talked and talked and then all of a sudden things\nwent to smash. A look came into her eyes and I knew she\ndid understand. Maybe she had understood all the time.\nI was furious. I couldn't stand it. I wanted her to\nunderstand but, don't you see, I couldn't let her\nunderstand. I felt that then she would know everything,\nthat I would be submerged, drowned out, you see. That's\nhow it is. I don't know why.\"\n\nThe old man dropped into a chair by the lamp and the\nboy listened, filled with awe. \"Go away, boy,\" said the\nman. \"Don't stay here with me any more. I thought it\nmight be a good thing to tell you but it isn't. I don't\nwant to talk any more. Go away.\"\n\nGeorge Willard shook his head and a note of command\ncame into his voice. \"Don't stop now. Tell me the rest\nof it,\" he commanded sharply. \"What happened? Tell me\nthe rest of the story.\"\n\nEnoch Robinson sprang to his feet and ran to the window\nthat looked down into the deserted main street of\nWinesburg. George Willard followed. By the window the\ntwo stood, the tall awkward boy-man and the little\nwrinkled man-boy. The childish, eager voice carried\nforward the tale. \"I swore at her,\" he explained. \"I\nsaid vile words. I ordered her to go away and not to\ncome back. Oh, I said terrible things. At first she\npretended not to understand but I kept at it. I\nscreamed and stamped on the floor. I made the house\nring with my curses. I didn't want ever to see her\nagain and I knew, after some of the things I said, that\nI never would see her again.\"\n\nThe old man's voice broke and he shook his head.\n\"Things went to smash,\" he said quietly and sadly. \"Out\nshe went through the door and all the life there had\nbeen in the room followed her out. She took all of my\npeople away. They all went out through the door after\nher. That's the way it was.\"\n\nGeorge Willard turned and went out of Enoch Robinson's\nroom. In the darkness by the window, as he went through\nthe door, he could hear the thin old voice whimpering\nand complaining. \"I'm alone, all alone here,\" said the\nvoice. \"It was warm and friendly in my room but now I'm\nall alone.\"\n\n\n\n\nAN AWAKENING\n\nBelle Carpenter had a dark skin, grey eyes, and thick\nlips. She was tall and strong. When black thoughts\nvisited her she grew angry and wished she were a man\nand could fight someone with her fists. She worked in\nthe millinery shop kept by Mrs. Kate McHugh and during\nthe day sat trimming hats by a window at the rear of\nthe store. She was the daughter of Henry Carpenter,\nbookkeeper in the First National Bank of Winesburg, and\nlived with him in a gloomy old house far out at the end\nof Buckeye Street. The house was surrounded by pine\ntrees and there was no grass beneath the trees. A rusty\ntin eaves-trough had slipped from its fastenings at the\nback of the house and when the wind blew it beat\nagainst the roof of a small shed, making a dismal\ndrumming noise that sometimes persisted all through the\nnight.\n\nWhen she was a young girl Henry Carpenter made life\nalmost unbearable for Belle, but as she emerged from\ngirlhood into womanhood he lost his power over her. The\nbookkeeper's life was made up of innumerable little\npettinesses. When he went to the bank in the morning he\nstepped into a closet and put on a black alpaca coat\nthat had become shabby with age. At night when he\nreturned to his home he donned another black alpaca\ncoat. Every evening he pressed the clothes worn in the\nstreets. He had invented an arrangement of boards for\nthe purpose. The trousers to his street suit were\nplaced between the boards and the boards were clamped\ntogether with heavy screws. In the morning he wiped the\nboards with a damp cloth and stood them upright behind\nthe dining room door. If they were moved during the day\nhe was speechless with anger and did not recover his\nequilibrium for a week.\n\nThe bank cashier was a little bully and was afraid of\nhis daughter. She, he realized, knew the story of his\nbrutal treatment of her mother and hated him for it.\nOne day she went home at noon and carried a handful of\nsoft mud, taken from the road, into the house. With the\nmud she smeared the face of the boards used for the\npressing of trousers and then went back to her work\nfeeling relieved and happy.\n\nBelle Carpenter occasionally walked out in the evening\nwith George Willard. Secretly she loved another man,\nbut her love affair, about which no one knew, caused\nher much anxiety. She was in love with Ed Handby,\nbartender in Ed Griffith's Saloon, and went about with\nthe young reporter as a kind of relief to her feelings.\nShe did not think that her station in life would permit\nher to be seen in the company of the bartender and\nwalked about under the trees with George Willard and\nlet him kiss her to relieve a longing that was very\ninsistent in her nature. She felt that she could keep\nthe younger man within bounds. About Ed Handby she was\nsomewhat uncertain.\n\nHandby, the bartender, was a tall, broad-shouldered man\nof thirty who lived in a room upstairs above Griffith's\nsaloon. His fists were large and his eyes unusually\nsmall, but his voice, as though striving to conceal the\npower back of his fists, was soft and quiet.\n\nAt twenty-five the bartender had inherited a large farm\nfrom an uncle in Indiana. When sold, the farm brought\nin eight thousand dollars, which Ed spent in six\nmonths. Going to Sandusky, on Lake Erie, he began an\norgy of dissipation, the story of which afterward\nfilled his home town with awe. Here and there he went\nthrowing the money about, driving carriages through the\nstreets, giving wine parties to crowds of men and\nwomen, playing cards for high stakes and keeping\nmistresses whose wardrobes cost him hundreds of\ndollars. One night at a resort called Cedar Point, he\ngot into a fight and ran amuck like a wild thing. With\nhis fist he broke a large mirror in the wash room of a\nhotel and later went about smashing windows and\nbreaking chairs in dance halls for the joy of hearing\nthe glass rattle on the floor and seeing the terror in\nthe eyes of clerks who had come from Sandusky to spend\nthe evening at the resort with their sweethearts.\n\nThe affair between Ed Handby and Belle Carpenter on the\nsurface amounted to nothing. He had succeeded in\nspending but one evening in her company. On that\nevening he hired a horse and buggy at Wesley Moyer's\nlivery barn and took her for a drive. The conviction\nthat she was the woman his nature demanded and that he\nmust get her settled upon him and he told her of his\ndesires. The bartender was ready to marry and to begin\ntrying to earn money for the support of his wife, but\nso simple was his nature that he found it difficult to\nexplain his intentions. His body ached with physical\nlonging and with his body he expressed himself. Taking\nthe milliner into his arms and holding her tightly in\nspite of her struggles, he kissed her until she became\nhelpless. Then he brought her back to town and let her\nout of the buggy. \"When I get hold of you again I'll\nnot let you go. You can't play with me,\" he declared as\nhe turned to drive away. Then, jumping out of the\nbuggy, he gripped her shoulders with his strong hands.\n\"I'll keep you for good the next time,\" he said. \"You\nmight as well make up your mind to that. It's you and\nme for it and I'm going to have you before I get\nthrough.\"\n\nOne night in January when there was a new moon George\nWillard, who was in Ed Handby's mind the only obstacle\nto his getting Belle Carpenter, went for a walk. Early\nthat evening George went into Ransom Surbeck's pool\nroom with Seth Richmond and Art Wilson, son of the town\nbutcher. Seth Richmond stood with his back against the\nwall and remained silent, but George Willard talked.\nThe pool room was filled with Winesburg boys and they\ntalked of women. The young reporter got into that vein.\nHe said that women should look out for themselves, that\nthe fellow who went out with a girl was not responsible\nfor what happened. As he talked he looked about, eager\nfor attention. He held the floor for five minutes and\nthen Art Wilson began to talk. Art was learning the\nbarber's trade in Cal Prouse's shop and already began\nto consider himself an authority in such matters as\nbaseball, horse racing, drinking, and going about with\nwomen. He began to tell of a night when he with two men\nfrom Winesburg went into a house of prostitution at the\ncounty seat. The butcher's son held a cigar in the side\nof his mouth and as he talked spat on the floor. \"The\nwomen in the place couldn't embarrass me although they\ntried hard enough,\" he boasted. \"One of the girls in\nthe house tried to get fresh, but I fooled her. As soon\nas she began to talk I went and sat in her lap.\nEveryone in the room laughed when I kissed her. I\ntaught her to let me alone.\"\n\nGeorge Willard went out of the pool room and into Main\nStreet. For days the weather had been bitter cold with\na high wind blowing down on the town from Lake Erie,\neighteen miles to the north, but on that night the wind\nhad died away and a new moon made the night unusually\nlovely. Without thinking where he was going or what he\nwanted to do, George went out of Main Street and began\nwalking in dimly lighted streets filled with frame\nhouses.\n\nOut of doors under the black sky filled with stars he\nforgot his companions of the pool room. Because it was\ndark and he was alone he began to talk aloud. In a\nspirit of play he reeled along the street imitating a\ndrunken man and then imagined himself a soldier clad in\nshining boots that reached to the knees and wearing a\nsword that jingled as he walked. As a soldier he\npictured himself as an inspector, passing before a long\nline of men who stood at attention. He began to examine\nthe accoutrements of the men. Before a tree he stopped\nand began to scold. \"Your pack is not in order,\" he\nsaid sharply. \"How many times will I have to speak of\nthis matter? Everything must be in order here. We have\na difficult task before us and no difficult task can be\ndone without order.\"\n\nHypnotized by his own words, the young man stumbled\nalong the board sidewalk saying more words. \"There is a\nlaw for armies and for men too,\" he muttered, lost in\nreflection. \"The law begins with little things and\nspreads out until it covers everything. In every little\nthing there must be order, in the place where men work,\nin their clothes, in their thoughts. I myself must be\norderly. I must learn that law. I must get myself into\ntouch with something orderly and big that swings\nthrough the night like a star. In my little way I must\nbegin to learn something, to give and swing and work\nwith life, with the law.\"\n\nGeorge Willard stopped by a picket fence near a street\nlamp and his body began to tremble. He had never before\nthought such thoughts as had just come into his head\nand he wondered where they had come from. For the\nmoment it seemed to him that some voice outside of\nhimself had been talking as he walked. He was amazed\nand delighted with his own mind and when he walked on\nagain spoke of the matter with fervor. \"To come out of\nRansom Surbeck's pool room and think things like that,\"\nhe whispered. \"It is better to be alone. If I talked\nlike Art Wilson the boys would understand me but they\nwouldn't understand what I've been thinking down here.\"\n\nIn Winesburg, as in all Ohio towns of twenty years ago,\nthere was a section in which lived day laborers. As the\ntime of factories had not yet come, the laborers worked\nin the fields or were section hands on the railroads.\nThey worked twelve hours a day and received one dollar\nfor the long day of toil. The houses in which they\nlived were small cheaply constructed wooden affairs\nwith a garden at the back. The more comfortable among\nthem kept cows and perhaps a pig, housed in a little\nshed at the rear of the garden.\n\nWith his head filled with resounding thoughts, George\nWillard walked into such a street on the clear January\nnight. The street was dimly lighted and in places there\nwas no sidewalk. In the scene that lay about him there\nwas something that excited his already aroused fancy.\nFor a year he had been devoting all of his odd moments\nto the reading of books and now some tale he had read\nconcerning life in old world towns of the middle ages\ncame sharply back to his mind so that he stumbled\nforward with the curious feeling of one revisiting a\nplace that had been a part of some former existence. On\nan impulse he turned out of the street and went into a\nlittle dark alleyway behind the sheds in which lived\nthe cows and pigs.\n\nFor a half hour he stayed in the alleyway, smelling the\nstrong smell of animals too closely housed and letting\nhis mind play with the strange new thoughts that came\nto him. The very rankness of the smell of manure in the\nclear sweet air awoke something heady in his brain. The\npoor little houses lighted by kerosene lamps, the smoke\nfrom the chimneys mounting straight up into the clear\nair, the grunting of pigs, the women clad in cheap\ncalico dresses and washing dishes in the kitchens, the\nfootsteps of men coming out of the houses and going off\nto the stores and saloons of Main Street, the dogs\nbarking and the children crying--all of these things\nmade him seem, as he lurked in the darkness, oddly\ndetached and apart from all life.\n\nThe excited young man, unable to bear the weight of his\nown thoughts, began to move cautiously along the\nalleyway. A dog attacked him and had to be driven away\nwith stones, and a man appeared at the door of one of\nthe houses and swore at the dog. George went into a\nvacant lot and throwing back his head looked up at the\nsky. He felt unutterably big and remade by the simple\nexperience through which he had been passing and in a\nkind of fervor of emotion put up his hands, thrusting\nthem into the darkness above his head and muttering\nwords. The desire to say words overcame him and he said\nwords without meaning, rolling them over on his tongue\nand saying them because they were brave words, full of\nmeaning. \"Death,\" he muttered, \"night, the sea, fear,\nloveliness.\"\n\nGeorge Willard came out of the vacant lot and stood\nagain on the sidewalk facing the houses. He felt that\nall of the people in the little street must be brothers\nand sisters to him and he wished he had the courage to\ncall them out of their houses and to shake their hands.\n\"If there were only a woman here I would take hold of\nher hand and we would run until we were both tired\nout,\" he thought. \"That would make me feel better.\"\nWith the thought of a woman in his mind he walked out\nof the street and went toward the house where Belle\nCarpenter lived. He thought she would understand his\nmood and that he could achieve in her presence a\nposition he had long been wanting to achieve. In the\npast when he had been with her and had kissed her lips\nhe had come away filled with anger at himself. He had\nfelt like one being used for some obscure purpose and\nhad not enjoyed the feeling. Now he thought he had\nsuddenly become too big to be used.\n\nWhen George got to Belle Carpenter's house there had\nalready been a visitor there before him. Ed Handby had\ncome to the door and calling Belle out of the house had\ntried to talk to her. He had wanted to ask the woman to\ncome away with him and to be his wife, but when she\ncame and stood by the door he lost his self-assurance\nand became sullen. \"You stay away from that kid,\" he\ngrowled, thinking of George Willard, and then, not\nknowing what else to say, turned to go away. \"If I\ncatch you together I will break your bones and his\ntoo,\" he added. The bartender had come to woo, not to\nthreaten, and was angry with himself because of his\nfailure.\n\nWhen her lover had departed Belle went indoors and ran\nhurriedly upstairs. From a window at the upper part of\nthe house she saw Ed Handby cross the street and sit\ndown on a horse block before the house of a neighbor.\nIn the dim light the man sat motionless holding his\nhead in his hands. She was made happy by the sight, and\nwhen George Willard came to the door she greeted him\neffusively and hurriedly put on her hat. She thought\nthat, as she walked through the streets with young\nWillard, Ed Handby would follow and she wanted to make\nhim suffer.\n\nFor an hour Belle Carpenter and the young reporter\nwalked about under the trees in the sweet night air.\nGeorge Willard was full of big words. The sense of\npower that had come to him during the hour in the\ndarkness in the alleyway remained with him and he\ntalked boldly, swaggering along and swinging his arms\nabout. He wanted to make Belle Carpenter realize that\nhe was aware of his former weakness and that he had\nchanged. \"You'll find me different,\" he declared,\nthrusting his hands into his pockets and looking boldly\ninto her eyes. \"I don't know why but it is so. You've\ngot to take me for a man or let me alone. That's how it\nis.\"\n\nUp and down the quiet streets under the new moon went\nthe woman and the boy. When George had finished talking\nthey turned down a side street and went across a bridge\ninto a path that ran up the side of a hill. The hill\nbegan at Waterworks Pond and climbed upward to the\nWinesburg Fair Grounds. On the hillside grew dense\nbushes and small trees and among the bushes were little\nopen spaces carpeted with long grass, now stiff and\nfrozen.\n\nAs he walked behind the woman up the hill George\nWillard's heart began to beat rapidly and his shoulders\nstraightened. Suddenly he decided that Belle Carpenter\nwas about to surrender herself to him. The new force\nthat had manifested itself in him had, he felt, been at\nwork upon her and had led to her conquest. The thought\nmade him half drunk with the sense of masculine power.\nAlthough he had been annoyed that as they walked about\nshe had not seemed to be listening to his words, the\nfact that she had accompanied him to this place took\nall his doubts away. \"It is different. Everything has\nbecome different,\" he thought and taking hold of her\nshoulder turned her about and stood looking at her, his\neyes shining with pride.\n\nBelle Carpenter did not resist. When he kissed her\nupon the lips she leaned heavily against him and looked\nover his shoulder into the darkness. In her whole\nattitude there was a suggestion of waiting. Again, as\nin the alleyway, George Willard's mind ran off into\nwords and, holding the woman tightly he whispered the\nwords into the still night. \"Lust,\" he whispered, \"lust\nand night and women.\"\n\nGeorge Willard did not understand what happened to him\nthat night on the hillside. Later, when he got to his\nown room, he wanted to weep and then grew half insane\nwith anger and hate. He hated Belle Carpenter and was\nsure that all his life he would continue to hate her.\nOn the hillside he had led the woman to one of the\nlittle open spaces among the bushes and had dropped to\nhis knees beside her. As in the vacant lot, by the\nlaborers' houses, he had put up his hands in gratitude\nfor the new power in himself and was waiting for the\nwoman to speak when Ed Handby appeared.\n\nThe bartender did not want to beat the boy, who he\nthought had tried to take his woman away. He knew that\nbeating was unnecessary, that he had power within\nhimself to accomplish his purpose without using his\nfists. Gripping George by the shoulder and pulling him\nto his feet, he held him with one hand while he looked\nat Belle Carpenter seated on the grass. Then with a\nquick wide movement of his arm he sent the younger man\nsprawling away into the bushes and began to bully the\nwoman, who had risen to her feet. \"You're no good,\" he\nsaid roughly. \"I've half a mind not to bother with you.\nI'd let you alone if I didn't want you so much.\"\n\nOn his hands and knees in the bushes George Willard\nstared at the scene before him and tried hard to think.\nHe prepared to spring at the man who had humiliated\nhim. To be beaten seemed to be infinitely better than\nto be thus hurled ignominiously aside.\n\nThree times the young reporter sprang at Ed Handby and\neach time the bartender, catching him by the shoulder,\nhurled him back into the bushes. The older man seemed\nprepared to keep the exercise going indefinitely but\nGeorge Willard's head struck the root of a tree and he\nlay still. Then Ed Handby took Belle Carpenter by the\narm and marched her away.\n\nGeorge heard the man and woman making their way through\nthe bushes. As he crept down the hillside his heart was\nsick within him. He hated himself and he hated the fate\nthat had brought about his humiliation. When his mind\nwent back to the hour alone in the alleyway he was\npuzzled and stopping in the darkness listened, hoping\nto hear again the voice outside himself that had so\nshort a time before put new courage into his heart.\nWhen his way homeward led him again into the street of\nframe houses he could not bear the sight and began to\nrun, wanting to get quickly out of the neighborhood\nthat now seemed to him utterly squalid and commonplace.\n\n\n\n\n\"QUEER\"\n\nFrom his seat on a box in the rough board shed that\nstuck like a burr on the rear of Cowley & Son's store\nin Winesburg, Elmer Cowley, the junior member of the\nfirm, could see through a dirty window into the\nprintshop of the Winesburg Eagle. Elmer was putting new\nshoelaces in his shoes. They did not go in readily and\nhe had to take the shoes off. With the shoes in his\nhand he sat looking at a large hole in the heel of one\nof his stockings. Then looking quickly up he saw George\nWillard, the only newspaper reporter in Winesburg,\nstanding at the back door of the Eagle printshop and\nstaring absentmindedly about. \"Well, well, what next!\"\nexclaimed the young man with the shoes in his hand,\njumping to his feet and creeping away from the window.\n\nA flush crept into Elmer Cowley's face and his hands\nbegan to tremble. In Cowley & Son's store a Jewish\ntraveling salesman stood by the counter talking to his\nfather. He imagined the reporter could hear what was\nbeing said and the thought made him furious. With one\nof the shoes still held in his hand he stood in a\ncorner of the shed and stamped with a stockinged foot\nupon the board floor.\n\nCowley & Son's store did not face the main street of\nWinesburg. The front was on Maumee Street and beyond it\nwas Voight's wagon shop and a shed for the sheltering\nof farmers' horses. Beside the store an alleyway ran\nbehind the main street stores and all day drays and\ndelivery wagons, intent on bringing in and taking out\ngoods, passed up and down. The store itself was\nindescribable. Will Henderson once said of it that it\nsold everything and nothing. In the window facing\nMaumee Street stood a chunk of coal as large as an\napple barrel, to indicate that orders for coal were\ntaken, and beside the black mass of the coal stood\nthree combs of honey grown brown and dirty in their\nwooden frames.\n\nThe honey had stood in the store window for six months.\nIt was for sale as were also the coat hangers, patent\nsuspender buttons, cans of roof paint, bottles of\nrheumatism cure, and a substitute for coffee that\ncompanioned the honey in its patient willingness to\nserve the public.\n\nEbenezer Cowley, the man who stood in the store\nlistening to the eager patter of words that fell from\nthe lips of the traveling man, was tall and lean and\nlooked unwashed. On his scrawny neck was a large wen\npartially covered by a grey beard. He wore a long\nPrince Albert coat. The coat had been purchased to\nserve as a wedding garment. Before he became a merchant\nEbenezer was a farmer and after his marriage he wore\nthe Prince Albert coat to church on Sundays and on\nSaturday afternoons when he came into town to trade.\nWhen he sold the farm to become a merchant he wore the\ncoat constantly. It had become brown with age and was\ncovered with grease spots, but in it Ebenezer always\nfelt dressed up and ready for the day in town.\n\nAs a merchant Ebenezer was not happily placed in life\nand he had not been happily placed as a farmer. Still\nhe existed. His family, consisting of a daughter named\nMabel and the son, lived with him in rooms above the\nstore and it did not cost them much to live. His\ntroubles were not financial. His unhappiness as a\nmerchant lay in the fact that when a traveling man with\nwares to be sold came in at the front door he was\nafraid. Behind the counter he stood shaking his head.\nHe was afraid, first that he would stubbornly refuse to\nbuy and thus lose the opportunity to sell again; second\nthat he would not be stubborn enough and would in a\nmoment of weakness buy what could not be sold.\n\nIn the store on the morning when Elmer Cowley saw\nGeorge Willard standing and apparently listening at the\nback door of the Eagle printshop, a situation had\narisen that always stirred the son's wrath. The\ntraveling man talked and Ebenezer listened, his whole\nfigure expressing uncertainty. \"You see how quickly it\nis done,\" said the traveling man, who had for sale a\nsmall flat metal substitute for collar buttons. With\none hand he quickly unfastened a collar from his shirt\nand then fastened it on again. He assumed a flattering\nwheedling tone. \"I tell you what, men have come to the\nend of all this fooling with collar buttons and you are\nthe man to make money out of the change that is coming.\nI am offering you the exclusive agency for this town.\nTake twenty dozen of these fasteners and I'll not visit\nany other store. I'll leave the field to you.\"\n\nThe traveling man leaned over the counter and tapped\nwith his finger on Ebenezer's breast. \"It's an\nopportunity and I want you to take it,\" he urged. \"A\nfriend of mine told me about you. 'See that man\nCowley,' he said. 'He's a live one.'\"\n\nThe traveling man paused and waited. Taking a book\nfrom his pocket he began writing out the order. Still\nholding the shoe in his hand Elmer Cowley went through\nthe store, past the two absorbed men, to a glass\nshowcase near the front door. He took a cheap revolver\nfrom the case and began to wave it about. \"You get out\nof here!\" he shrieked. \"We don't want any collar\nfasteners here.\" An idea came to him. \"Mind, I'm not\nmaking any threat,\" he added. \"I don't say I'll shoot.\nMaybe I just took this gun out of the case to look at\nit. But you better get out. Yes sir, I'll say that. You\nbetter grab up your things and get out.\"\n\nThe young storekeeper's voice rose to a scream and\ngoing behind the counter he began to advance upon the\ntwo men. \"We're through being fools here!\" he cried.\n\"We ain't going to buy any more stuff until we begin to\nsell. We ain't going to keep on being queer and have\nfolks staring and listening. You get out of here!\"\n\nThe traveling man left. Raking the samples of collar\nfasteners off the counter into a black leather bag, he\nran. He was a small man and very bow-legged and he ran\nawkwardly. The black bag caught against the door and he\nstumbled and fell. \"Crazy, that's what he is--crazy!\"\nhe sputtered as he arose from the sidewalk and hurried\naway.\n\nIn the store Elmer Cowley and his father stared at each\nother. Now that the immediate object of his wrath had\nfled, the younger man was embarrassed. \"Well, I meant\nit. I think we've been queer long enough,\" he declared,\ngoing to the showcase and replacing the revolver.\nSitting on a barrel he pulled on and fastened the shoe\nhe had been holding in his hand. He was waiting for\nsome word of understanding from his father but when\nEbenezer spoke his words only served to reawaken the\nwrath in the son and the young man ran out of the store\nwithout replying. Scratching his grey beard with his\nlong dirty fingers, the merchant looked at his son with\nthe same wavering uncertain stare with which he had\nconfronted the traveling man. \"I'll be starched,\" he\nsaid softly. \"Well, well, I'll be washed and ironed and\nstarched!\"\n\nElmer Cowley went out of Winesburg and along a country\nroad that paralleled the railroad track. He did not\nknow where he was going or what he was going to do. In\nthe shelter of a deep cut where the road, after turning\nsharply to the right, dipped under the tracks he\nstopped and the passion that had been the cause of his\noutburst in the store began to again find expression.\n\"I will not be queer--one to be looked at and listened\nto,\" he declared aloud. \"I'll be like other people.\nI'll show that George Willard. He'll find out. I'll\nshow him!\"\n\nThe distraught young man stood in the middle of the\nroad and glared back at the town. He did not know the\nreporter George Willard and had no special feeling\nconcerning the tall boy who ran about town gathering\nthe town news. The reporter had merely come, by his\npresence in the office and in the printshop of the\nWinesburg Eagle, to stand for something in the young\nmerchant's mind. He thought the boy who passed and\nrepassed Cowley & Son's store and who stopped to talk\nto people in the street must be thinking of him and\nperhaps laughing at him. George Willard, he felt,\nbelonged to the town, typified the town, represented in\nhis person the spirit of the town. Elmer Cowley could\nnot have believed that George Willard had also his days\nof unhappiness, that vague hungers and secret unnamable\ndesires visited also his mind. Did he not represent\npublic opinion and had not the public opinion of\nWinesburg condemned the Cowleys to queerness? Did he\nnot walk whistling and laughing through Main Street?\nMight not one by striking his person strike also the\ngreater enemy--the thing that smiled and went its own\nway--the judgment of Winesburg?\n\nElmer Cowley was extraordinarily tall and his arms were\nlong and powerful. His hair, his eyebrows, and the\ndowny beard that had begun to grow upon his chin, were\npale almost to whiteness. His teeth protruded from\nbetween his lips and his eyes were blue with the\ncolorless blueness of the marbles called \"aggies\" that\nthe boys of Winesburg carried in their pockets. Elmer\nhad lived in Winesburg for a year and had made no\nfriends. He was, he felt, one condemned to go through\nlife without friends and he hated the thought.\n\nSullenly the tall young man tramped along the road with\nhis hands stuffed into his trouser pockets. The day was\ncold with a raw wind, but presently the sun began to\nshine and the road became soft and muddy. The tops of\nthe ridges of frozen mud that formed the road began to\nmelt and the mud clung to Elmer's shoes. His feet\nbecame cold. When he had gone several miles he turned\noff the road, crossed a field and entered a wood. In\nthe wood he gathered sticks to build a fire, by which\nhe sat trying to warm himself, miserable in body and in\nmind.\n\nFor two hours he sat on the log by the fire and then,\narising and creeping cautiously through a mass of\nunderbrush, he went to a fence and looked across fields\nto a small farmhouse surrounded by low sheds. A smile\ncame to his lips and he began making motions with his\nlong arms to a man who was husking corn in one of the\nfields.\n\nIn his hour of misery the young merchant had returned\nto the farm where he had lived through boyhood and\nwhere there was another human being to whom he felt he\ncould explain himself. The man on the farm was a\nhalf-witted old fellow named Mook. He had once been\nemployed by Ebenezer Cowley and had stayed on the farm\nwhen it was sold. The old man lived in one of the\nunpainted sheds back of the farmhouse and puttered\nabout all day in the fields.\n\nMook the half-wit lived happily. With childlike faith\nhe believed in the intelligence of the animals that\nlived in the sheds with him, and when he was lonely\nheld long conversations with the cows, the pigs, and\neven with the chickens that ran about the barnyard. He\nit was who had put the expression regarding being\n\"laundered\" into the mouth of his former employer. When\nexcited or surprised by anything he smiled vaguely and\nmuttered: \"I'll be washed and ironed. Well, well, I'll\nbe washed and ironed and starched.\"\n\nWhen the half-witted old man left his husking of corn\nand came into the wood to meet Elmer Cowley, he was\nneither surprised nor especially interested in the\nsudden appearance of the young man. His feet also were\ncold and he sat on the log by the fire, grateful for\nthe warmth and apparently indifferent to what Elmer had\nto say.\n\nElmer talked earnestly and with great freedom, walking\nup and down and waving his arms about. \"You don't\nunderstand what's the matter with me so of course you\ndon't care,\" he declared. \"With me it's different. Look\nhow it has always been with me. Father is queer and\nmother was queer, too. Even the clothes mother used to\nwear were not like other people's clothes, and look at\nthat coat in which father goes about there in town,\nthinking he's dressed up, too. Why don't he get a new\none? It wouldn't cost much. I'll tell you why. Father\ndoesn't know and when mother was alive she didn't know\neither. Mabel is different. She knows but she won't say\nanything. I will, though. I'm not going to be stared at\nany longer. Why look here, Mook, father doesn't know\nthat his store there in town is just a queer jumble,\nthat he'll never sell the stuff he buys. He knows\nnothing about it. Sometimes he's a little worried that\ntrade doesn't come and then he goes and buys something\nelse. In the evenings he sits by the fire upstairs and\nsays trade will come after a while. He isn't worried.\nHe's queer. He doesn't know enough to be worried.\"\n\nThe excited young man became more excited. \"He don't\nknow but I know,\" he shouted, stopping to gaze down\ninto the dumb, unresponsive face of the half-wit. \"I\nknow too well. I can't stand it. When we lived out here\nit was different. I worked and at night I went to bed\nand slept. I wasn't always seeing people and thinking\nas I am now. In the evening, there in town, I go to the\npost office or to the depot to see the train come in,\nand no one says anything to me. Everyone stands around\nand laughs and they talk but they say nothing to me.\nThen I feel so queer that I can't talk either. I go\naway. I don't say anything. I can't.\"\n\nThe fury of the young man became uncontrollable. \"I\nwon't stand it,\" he yelled, looking up at the bare\nbranches of the trees. \"I'm not made to stand it.\"\n\nMaddened by the dull face of the man on the log by the\nfire, Elmer turned and glared at him as he had glared\nback along the road at the town of Winesburg. \"Go on\nback to work,\" he screamed. \"What good does it do me to\ntalk to you?\" A thought came to him and his voice\ndropped. \"I'm a coward too, eh?\" he muttered. \"Do you\nknow why I came clear out here afoot? I had to tell\nsomeone and you were the only one I could tell. I\nhunted out another queer one, you see. I ran away,\nthat's what I did. I couldn't stand up to someone like\nthat George Willard. I had to come to you. I ought to\ntell him and I will.\"\n\nAgain his voice arose to a shout and his arms flew\nabout. \"I will tell him. I won't be queer. I don't care\nwhat they think. I won't stand it.\"\n\nElmer Cowley ran out of the woods leaving the half-wit\nsitting on the log before the fire. Presently the old\nman arose and climbing over the fence went back to his\nwork in the corn. \"I'll be washed and ironed and\nstarched,\" he declared. \"Well, well, I'll be washed and\nironed.\" Mook was interested. He went along a lane to a\nfield where two cows stood nibbling at a straw stack.\n\"Elmer was here,\" he said to the cows. \"Elmer is crazy.\nYou better get behind the stack where he don't see you.\nHe'll hurt someone yet, Elmer will.\"\n\nAt eight o'clock that evening Elmer Cowley put his head\nin at the front door of the office of the Winesburg\nEagle where George Willard sat writing. His cap was\npulled down over his eyes and a sullen determined look\nwas on his face. \"You come on outside with me,\" he\nsaid, stepping in and closing the door. He kept his\nhand on the knob as though prepared to resist anyone\nelse coming in. \"You just come along outside. I want to\nsee you.\"\n\nGeorge Willard and Elmer Cowley walked through the main\nstreet of Winesburg. The night was cold and George\nWillard had on a new overcoat and looked very spruce\nand dressed up. He thrust his hands into the overcoat\npockets and looked inquiringly at his companion. He had\nlong been wanting to make friends with the young\nmerchant and find out what was in his mind. Now he\nthought he saw a chance and was delighted. \"I wonder\nwhat he's up to? Perhaps he thinks he has a piece of\nnews for the paper. It can't be a fire because I\nhaven't heard the fire bell and there isn't anyone\nrunning,\" he thought.\n\nIn the main street of Winesburg, on the cold November\nevening, but few citizens appeared and these hurried\nalong bent on getting to the stove at the back of some\nstore. The windows of the stores were frosted and the\nwind rattled the tin sign that hung over the entrance\nto the stairway leading to Doctor Welling's office.\nBefore Hern's Grocery a basket of apples and a rack\nfilled with new brooms stood on the sidewalk. Elmer\nCowley stopped and stood facing George Willard. He\ntried to talk and his arms began to pump up and down.\nHis face worked spasmodically. He seemed about to\nshout. \"Oh, you go on back,\" he cried. \"Don't stay out\nhere with me. I ain't got anything to tell you. I don't\nwant to see you at all.\"\n\nFor three hours the distracted young merchant wandered\nthrough the resident streets of Winesburg blind with\nanger, brought on by his failure to declare his\ndetermination not to be queer. Bitterly the sense of\ndefeat settled upon him and he wanted to weep. After\nthe hours of futile sputtering at nothingness that had\noccupied the afternoon and his failure in the presence\nof the young reporter, he thought he could see no hope\nof a future for himself.\n\nAnd then a new idea dawned for him. In the darkness\nthat surrounded him he began to see a light. Going to\nthe now darkened store, where Cowley & Son had for over\na year waited vainly for trade to come, he crept\nstealthily in and felt about in a barrel that stood by\nthe stove at the rear. In the barrel beneath shavings\nlay a tin box containing Cowley & Son's cash. Every\nevening Ebenezer Cowley put the box in the barrel when\nhe closed the store and went upstairs to bed. \"They\nwouldn't never think of a careless place like that,\" he\ntold himself, thinking of robbers.\n\nElmer took twenty dollars, two ten-dollar bills, from\nthe little roll containing perhaps four hundred\ndollars, the cash left from the sale of the farm. Then\nreplacing the box beneath the shavings he went quietly\nout at the front door and walked again in the streets.\n\nThe idea that he thought might put an end to all of his\nunhappiness was very simple. \"I will get out of here,\nrun away from home,\" he told himself. He knew that a\nlocal freight train passed through Winesburg at\nmidnight and went on to Cleveland, where it arrived at\ndawn. He would steal a ride on the local and when he\ngot to Cleveland would lose himself in the crowds\nthere. He would get work in some shop and become\nfriends with the other workmen and would be\nindistinguishable. Then he could talk and laugh. He\nwould no longer be queer and would make friends. Life\nwould begin to have warmth and meaning for him as it\nhad for others.\n\nThe tall awkward young man, striding through the\nstreets, laughed at himself because he had been angry\nand had been half afraid of George Willard. He decided\nhe would have his talk with the young reporter before\nhe left town, that he would tell him about things,\nperhaps challenge him, challenge all of Winesburg\nthrough him.\n\nAglow with new confidence Elmer went to the office of\nthe New Willard House and pounded on the door. A\nsleep-eyed boy slept on a cot in the office. He\nreceived no salary but was fed at the hotel table and\nbore with pride the title of \"night clerk.\" Before the\nboy Elmer was bold, insistent. \"You 'wake him up,\" he\ncommanded. \"You tell him to come down by the depot. I\ngot to see him and I'm going away on the local. Tell\nhim to dress and come on down. I ain't got much time.\"\n\nThe midnight local had finished its work in Winesburg\nand the trainsmen were coupling cars, swinging lanterns\nand preparing to resume their flight east. George\nWillard, rubbing his eyes and again wearing the new\novercoat, ran down to the station platform afire with\ncuriosity. \"Well, here I am. What do you want? You've\ngot something to tell me, eh?\" he said.\n\nElmer tried to explain. He wet his lips with his\ntongue and looked at the train that had begun to groan\nand get under way. \"Well, you see,\" he began, and then\nlost control of his tongue. \"I'll be washed and ironed.\nI'll be washed and ironed and starched,\" he muttered\nhalf incoherently.\n\nElmer Cowley danced with fury beside the groaning train\nin the darkness on the station platform. Lights leaped\ninto the air and bobbed up and down before his eyes.\nTaking the two ten-dollar bills from his pocket he\nthrust them into George Willard's hand. \"Take them,\" he\ncried. \"I don't want them. Give them to father. I stole\nthem.\" With a snarl of rage he turned and his long arms\nbegan to flay the air. Like one struggling for release\nfrom hands that held him he struck out, hitting George\nWillard blow after blow on the breast, the neck, the\nmouth. The young reporter rolled over on the platform\nhalf unconscious, stunned by the terrific force of the\nblows. Springing aboard the passing train and running\nover the tops of cars, Elmer sprang down to a flat car\nand lying on his face looked back, trying to see the\nfallen man in the darkness. Pride surged up in him. \"I\nshowed him,\" he cried. \"I guess I showed him. I ain't\nso queer. I guess I showed him I ain't so queer.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE UNTOLD LIE\n\nRay Pearson and Hal Winters were farm hands employed on\na farm three miles north of Winesburg. On Saturday\nafternoons they came into town and wandered about\nthrough the streets with other fellows from the\ncountry.\n\nRay was a quiet, rather nervous man of perhaps fifty\nwith a brown beard and shoulders rounded by too much\nand too hard labor. In his nature he was as unlike Hal\nWinters as two men can be unlike.\n\nRay was an altogether serious man and had a little\nsharp-featured wife who had also a sharp voice. The\ntwo, with half a dozen thin-legged children, lived in a\ntumble-down frame house beside a creek at the back end\nof the Wills farm where Ray was employed.\n\nHal Winters, his fellow employee, was a young fellow.\nHe was not of the Ned Winters family, who were very\nrespectable people in Winesburg, but was one of the\nthree sons of the old man called Windpeter Winters who\nhad a sawmill near Unionville, six miles away, and who\nwas looked upon by everyone in Winesburg as a confirmed\nold reprobate.\n\nPeople from the part of Northern Ohio in which\nWinesburg lies will remember old Windpeter by his\nunusual and tragic death. He got drunk one evening in\ntown and started to drive home to Unionville along the\nrailroad tracks. Henry Brattenburg, the butcher, who\nlived out that way, stopped him at the edge of the town\nand told him he was sure to meet the down train but\nWindpeter slashed at him with his whip and drove on.\nWhen the train struck and killed him and his two horses\na farmer and his wife who were driving home along a\nnearby road saw the accident. They said that old\nWindpeter stood up on the seat of his wagon, raving and\nswearing at the onrushing locomotive, and that he\nfairly screamed with delight when the team, maddened by\nhis incessant slashing at them, rushed straight ahead\nto certain death. Boys like young George Willard and\nSeth Richmond will remember the incident quite vividly\nbecause, although everyone in our town said that the\nold man would go straight to hell and that the\ncommunity was better off without him, they had a secret\nconviction that he knew what he was doing and admired\nhis foolish courage. Most boys have seasons of wishing\nthey could die gloriously instead of just being grocery\nclerks and going on with their humdrum lives.\n\nBut this is not the story of Windpeter Winters nor yet\nof his son Hal who worked on the Wills farm with Ray\nPearson. It is Ray's story. It will, however, be\nnecessary to talk a little of young Hal so that you\nwill get into the spirit of it.\n\nHal was a bad one. Everyone said that. There were\nthree of the Winters boys in that family, John, Hal,\nand Edward, all broad-shouldered big fellows like old\nWindpeter himself and all fighters and woman-chasers\nand generally all-around bad ones.\n\nHal was the worst of the lot and always up to some\ndevilment. He once stole a load of boards from his\nfather's mill and sold them in Winesburg. With the\nmoney he bought himself a suit of cheap, flashy\nclothes. Then he got drunk and when his father came\nraving into town to find him, they met and fought with\ntheir fists on Main Street and were arrested and put\ninto jail together.\n\nHal went to work on the Wills farm because there was a\ncountry school teacher out that way who had taken his\nfancy. He was only twenty-two then but had already been\nin two or three of what were spoken of in Winesburg as\n\"women scrapes.\" Everyone who heard of his infatuation\nfor the school teacher was sure it would turn out\nbadly. \"He'll only get her into trouble, you'll see,\"\nwas the word that went around.\n\nAnd so these two men, Ray and Hal, were at work in a\nfield on a day in the late October. They were husking\ncorn and occasionally something was said and they\nlaughed. Then came silence. Ray, who was the more\nsensitive and always minded things more, had chapped\nhands and they hurt. He put them into his coat pockets\nand looked away across the fields. He was in a sad,\ndistracted mood and was affected by the beauty of the\ncountry. If you knew the Winesburg country in the fall\nand how the low hills are all splashed with yellows and\nreds you would understand his feeling. He began to\nthink of the time, long ago when he was a young fellow\nliving with his father, then a baker in Winesburg, and\nhow on such days he had wandered away into the woods to\ngather nuts, hunt rabbits, or just to loaf about and\nsmoke his pipe. His marriage had come about through one\nof his days of wandering. He had induced a girl who\nwaited on trade in his father's shop to go with him and\nsomething had happened. He was thinking of that\nafternoon and how it had affected his whole life when a\nspirit of protest awoke in him. He had forgotten about\nHal and muttered words. \"Tricked by Gad, that's what I\nwas, tricked by life and made a fool of,\" he said in a\nlow voice.\n\nAs though understanding his thoughts, Hal Winters spoke\nup. \"Well, has it been worth while? What about it, eh?\nWhat about marriage and all that?\" he asked and then\nlaughed. Hal tried to keep on laughing but he too was\nin an earnest mood. He began to talk earnestly. \"Has a\nfellow got to do it?\" he asked. \"Has he got to be\nharnessed up and driven through life like a horse?\"\n\nHal didn't wait for an answer but sprang to his feet\nand began to walk back and forth between the corn\nshocks. He was getting more and more excited. Bending\ndown suddenly he picked up an ear of the yellow corn\nand threw it at the fence. \"I've got Nell Gunther in\ntrouble,\" he said. \"I'm telling you, but you keep your\nmouth shut.\"\n\nRay Pearson arose and stood staring. He was almost a\nfoot shorter than Hal, and when the younger man came\nand put his two hands on the older man's shoulders they\nmade a picture. There they stood in the big empty field\nwith the quiet corn shocks standing in rows behind them\nand the red and yellow hills in the distance, and from\nbeing just two indifferent workmen they had become all\nalive to each other. Hal sensed it and because that was\nhis way he laughed. \"Well, old daddy,\" he said\nawkwardly, \"come on, advise me. I've got Nell in\ntrouble. Perhaps you've been in the same fix yourself.\nI know what everyone would say is the right thing to\ndo, but what do you say? Shall I marry and settle down?\nShall I put myself into the harness to be worn out like\nan old horse? You know me, Ray. There can't anyone\nbreak me but I can break myself. Shall I do it or shall\nI tell Nell to go to the devil? Come on, you tell me.\nWhatever you say, Ray, I'll do.\"\n\nRay couldn't answer. He shook Hal's hands loose and\nturning walked straight away toward the barn. He was a\nsensitive man and there were tears in his eyes. He knew\nthere was only one thing to say to Hal Winters, son of\nold Windpeter Winters, only one thing that all his own\ntraining and all the beliefs of the people he knew\nwould approve, but for his life he couldn't say what he\nknew he should say.\n\nAt half-past four that afternoon Ray was puttering\nabout the barnyard when his wife came up the lane along\nthe creek and called him. After the talk with Hal he\nhadn't returned to the cornfield but worked about the\nbarn. He had already done the evening chores and had\nseen Hal, dressed and ready for a roistering night in\ntown, come out of the farmhouse and go into the road.\nAlong the path to his own house he trudged behind his\nwife, looking at the ground and thinking. He couldn't\nmake out what was wrong. Every time he raised his eyes\nand saw the beauty of the country in the failing light\nhe wanted to do something he had never done before,\nshout or scream or hit his wife with his fists or\nsomething equally unexpected and terrifying. Along the\npath he went scratching his head and trying to make it\nout. He looked hard at his wife's back but she seemed\nall right.\n\nShe only wanted him to go into town for groceries and\nas soon as she had told him what she wanted began to\nscold. \"You're always puttering,\" she said. \"Now I want\nyou to hustle. There isn't anything in the house for\nsupper and you've got to get to town and back in a\nhurry.\"\n\nRay went into his own house and took an overcoat from a\nhook back of the door. It was torn about the pockets\nand the collar was shiny. His wife went into the\nbedroom and presently came out with a soiled cloth in\none hand and three silver dollars in the other.\nSomewhere in the house a child wept bitterly and a dog\nthat had been sleeping by the stove arose and yawned.\nAgain the wife scolded. \"The children will cry and cry.\nWhy are you always puttering?\" she asked.\n\nRay went out of the house and climbed the fence into a\nfield. It was just growing dark and the scene that lay\nbefore him was lovely. All the low hills were washed\nwith color and even the little clusters of bushes in\nthe corners of the fences were alive with beauty. The\nwhole world seemed to Ray Pearson to have become alive\nwith something just as he and Hal had suddenly become\nalive when they stood in the corn field staring into\neach other's eyes.\n\nThe beauty of the country about Winesburg was too much\nfor Ray on that fall evening. That is all there was to\nit. He could not stand it. Of a sudden he forgot all\nabout being a quiet old farm hand and throwing off the\ntorn overcoat began to run across the field. As he ran\nhe shouted a protest against his life, against all\nlife, against everything that makes life ugly. \"There\nwas no promise made,\" he cried into the empty spaces\nthat lay about him. \"I didn't promise my Minnie\nanything and Hal hasn't made any promise to Nell. I\nknow he hasn't. She went into the woods with him\nbecause she wanted to go. What he wanted she wanted.\nWhy should I pay? Why should Hal pay? Why should anyone\npay? I don't want Hal to become old and worn out. I'll\ntell him. I won't let it go on. I'll catch Hal before\nhe gets to town and I'll tell him.\"\n\nRay ran clumsily and once he stumbled and fell down.\n\"I must catch Hal and tell him,\" he kept thinking, and\nalthough his breath came in gasps he kept running\nharder and harder. As he ran he thought of things that\nhadn't come into his mind for years--how at the time he\nmarried he had planned to go west to his uncle in\nPortland, Oregon--how he hadn't wanted to be a farm\nhand, but had thought when he got out West he would go\nto sea and be a sailor or get a job on a ranch and ride\na horse into Western towns, shouting and laughing and\nwaking the people in the houses with his wild cries.\nThen as he ran he remembered his children and in fancy\nfelt their hands clutching at him. All of his thoughts\nof himself were involved with the thoughts of Hal and\nhe thought the children were clutching at the younger\nman also. \"They are the accidents of life, Hal,\" he\ncried. \"They are not mine or yours. I had nothing to do\nwith them.\"\n\nDarkness began to spread over the fields as Ray Pearson\nran on and on. His breath came in little sobs. When he\ncame to the fence at the edge of the road and\nconfronted Hal Winters, all dressed up and smoking a\npipe as he walked jauntily along, he could not have\ntold what he thought or what he wanted.\n\nRay Pearson lost his nerve and this is really the end\nof the story of what happened to him. It was almost\ndark when he got to the fence and he put his hands on\nthe top bar and stood staring. Hal Winters jumped a\nditch and coming up close to Ray put his hands into his\npockets and laughed. He seemed to have lost his own\nsense of what had happened in the corn field and when\nhe put up a strong hand and took hold of the lapel of\nRay's coat he shook the old man as he might have shaken\na dog that had misbehaved.\n\n\"You came to tell me, eh?\" he said. \"Well, never mind\ntelling me anything. I'm not a coward and I've already\nmade up my mind.\" He laughed again and jumped back\nacross the ditch. \"Nell ain't no fool,\" he said. \"She\ndidn't ask me to marry her. I want to marry her. I want\nto settle down and have kids.\"\n\nRay Pearson also laughed. He felt like laughing at\nhimself and all the world.\n\nAs the form of Hal Winters disappeared in the dusk that\nlay over the road that led to Winesburg, he turned and\nwalked slowly back across the fields to where he had\nleft his torn overcoat. As he went some memory of\npleasant evenings spent with the thin-legged children\nin the tumble-down house by the creek must have come\ninto his mind, for he muttered words. \"It's just as\nwell. Whatever I told him would have been a lie,\" he\nsaid softly, and then his form also disappeared into\nthe darkness of the fields.\n\n\n\n\nDRINK\n\nTom Foster came to Winesburg from Cincinnati when he\nwas still young and could get many new impressions. His\ngrandmother had been raised on a farm near the town and\nas a young girl had gone to school there when Winesburg\nwas a village of twelve or fifteen houses clustered\nabout a general store on the Trunion Pike.\n\nWhat a life the old woman had led since she went away\nfrom the frontier settlement and what a strong, capable\nlittle old thing she was! She had been in Kansas, in\nCanada, and in New York City, traveling about with her\nhusband, a mechanic, before he died. Later she went to\nstay with her daughter, who had also married a mechanic\nand lived in Covington, Kentucky, across the river from\nCincinnati.\n\nThen began the hard years for Tom Foster's grandmother.\nFirst her son-in-law was killed by a policeman during a\nstrike and then Tom's mother became an invalid and died\nalso. The grandmother had saved a little money, but it\nwas swept away by the illness of the daughter and by\nthe cost of the two funerals. She became a half\nworn-out old woman worker and lived with the grandson\nabove a junk shop on a side street in Cincinnati. For\nfive years she scrubbed the floors in an office\nbuilding and then got a place as dish washer in a\nrestaurant. Her hands were all twisted out of shape.\nWhen she took hold of a mop or a broom handle the hands\nlooked like the dried stems of an old creeping vine\nclinging to a tree.\n\nThe old woman came back to Winesburg as soon as she got\nthe chance. One evening as she was coming home from\nwork she found a pocket-book containing thirty-seven\ndollars, and that opened the way. The trip was a great\nadventure for the boy. It was past seven o'clock at\nnight when the grandmother came home with the\npocket-book held tightly in her old hands and she was\nso excited she could scarcely speak. She insisted on\nleaving Cincinnati that night, saying that if they\nstayed until morning the owner of the money would be\nsure to find them out and make trouble. Tom, who was\nthen sixteen years old, had to go trudging off to the\nstation with the old woman, bearing all of their\nearthly belongings done up in a worn-out blanket and\nslung across his back. By his side walked the\ngrandmother urging him forward. Her toothless old mouth\ntwitched nervously, and when Tom grew weary and wanted\nto put the pack down at a street crossing, she snatched\nit up and if he had not prevented would have slung it\nacross her own back. When they got into the train and\nit had run out of the city she was as delighted as a\ngirl and talked as the boy had never heard her talk\nbefore.\n\nAll through the night as the train rattled along, the\ngrandmother told Tom tales of Winesburg and of how he\nwould enjoy his life working in the fields and shooting\nwild things in the woods there. She could not believe\nthat the tiny village of fifty years before had grown\ninto a thriving town in her absence, and in the morning\nwhen the train came to Winesburg did not want to get\noff. \"It isn't what I thought. It may be hard for you\nhere,\" she said, and then the train went on its way and\nthe two stood confused, not knowing where to turn, in\nthe presence of Albert Longworth, the Winesburg baggage\nmaster.\n\nBut Tom Foster did get along all right. He was one to\nget along anywhere. Mrs. White, the banker's wife,\nemployed his grandmother to work in the kitchen and he\ngot a place as stable boy in the banker's new brick\nbarn.\n\nIn Winesburg servants were hard to get. The woman who\nwanted help in her housework employed a \"hired girl\"\nwho insisted on sitting at the table with the family.\nMrs. White was sick of hired girls and snatched at the\nchance to get hold of the old city woman. She furnished\na room for the boy Tom upstairs in the barn. \"He can\nmow the lawn and run errands when the horses do not\nneed attention,\" she explained to her husband.\n\nTom Foster was rather small for his age and had a large\nhead covered with stiff black hair that stood straight\nup. The hair emphasized the bigness of his head. His\nvoice was the softest thing imaginable, and he was\nhimself so gentle and quiet that he slipped into the\nlife of the town without attracting the least bit of\nattention.\n\nOne could not help wondering where Tom Foster got his\ngentleness. In Cincinnati he had lived in a\nneighborhood where gangs of tough boys prowled through\nthe streets, and all through his early formative years\nhe ran about with tough boys. For a while he was a\nmessenger for a telegraph company and delivered\nmessages in a neighborhood sprinkled with houses of\nprostitution. The women in the houses knew and loved\nTom Foster and the tough boys in the gangs loved him\nalso.\n\nHe never asserted himself. That was one thing that\nhelped him escape. In an odd way he stood in the shadow\nof the wall of life, was meant to stand in the shadow.\nHe saw the men and women in the houses of lust, sensed\ntheir casual and horrible love affairs, saw boys\nfighting and listened to their tales of thieving and\ndrunkenness, unmoved and strangely unaffected.\n\nOnce Tom did steal. That was while he still lived in\nthe city. The grandmother was ill at the time and he\nhimself was out of work. There was nothing to eat in\nthe house, and so he went into a harness shop on a side\nstreet and stole a dollar and seventy-five cents out of\nthe cash drawer.\n\nThe harness shop was run by an old man with a long\nmustache. He saw the boy lurking about and thought\nnothing of it. When he went out into the street to talk\nto a teamster Tom opened the cash drawer and taking the\nmoney walked away. Later he was caught and his\ngrandmother settled the matter by offering to come\ntwice a week for a month and scrub the shop. The boy\nwas ashamed, but he was rather glad, too. \"It is all\nright to be ashamed and makes me understand new\nthings,\" he said to the grandmother, who didn't know\nwhat the boy was talking about but loved him so much\nthat it didn't matter whether she understood or not.\n\nFor a year Tom Foster lived in the banker's stable and\nthen lost his place there. He didn't take very good\ncare of the horses and he was a constant source of\nirritation to the banker's wife. She told him to mow\nthe lawn and he forgot. Then she sent him to the store\nor to the post office and he did not come back but\njoined a group of men and boys and spent the whole\nafternoon with them, standing about, listening and\noccasionally, when addressed, saying a few words. As in\nthe city in the houses of prostitution and with the\nrowdy boys running through the streets at night, so in\nWinesburg among its citizens he had always the power to\nbe a part of and yet distinctly apart from the life\nabout him.\n\nAfter Tom lost his place at Banker White's he did not\nlive with his grandmother, although often in the\nevening she came to visit him. He rented a room at the\nrear of a little frame building belonging to old Rufus\nWhiting. The building was on Duane Street, just off\nMain Street, and had been used for years as a law\noffice by the old man, who had become too feeble and\nforgetful for the practice of his profession but did\nnot realize his inefficiency. He liked Tom and let him\nhave the room for a dollar a month. In the late\nafternoon when the lawyer had gone home the boy had the\nplace to himself and spent hours lying on the floor by\nthe stove and thinking of things. In the evening the\ngrandmother came and sat in the lawyer's chair to smoke\na pipe while Tom remained silent, as he always did in\nthe presence of everyone.\n\nOften the old woman talked with great vigor. Sometimes\nshe was angry about some happening at the banker's\nhouse and scolded away for hours. Out of her own\nearnings she bought a mop and regularly scrubbed the\nlawyer's office. Then when the place was spotlessly\nclean and smelled clean she lighted her clay pipe and\nshe and Tom had a smoke together. \"When you get ready\nto die then I will die also,\" she said to the boy lying\non the floor beside her chair.\n\nTom Foster enjoyed life in Winesburg. He did odd jobs,\nsuch as cutting wood for kitchen stoves and mowing the\ngrass before houses. In late May and early June he\npicked strawberries in the fields. He had time to loaf\nand he enjoyed loafing. Banker White had given him a\ncast-off coat which was too large for him, but his\ngrandmother cut it down, and he had also an overcoat,\ngot at the same place, that was lined with fur. The fur\nwas worn away in spots, but the coat was warm and in\nthe winter Tom slept in it. He thought his method of\ngetting along good enough and was happy and satisfied\nwith the way life in Winesburg had turned out for him.\n\nThe most absurd little things made Tom Foster happy.\nThat, I suppose, was why people loved him. In Hern's\nGrocery they would be roasting coffee on Friday\nafternoon, preparatory to the Saturday rush of trade,\nand the rich odor invaded lower Main Street. Tom Foster\nappeared and sat on a box at the rear of the store. For\nan hour he did not move but sat perfectly still,\nfilling his being with the spicy odor that made him\nhalf drunk with happiness. \"I like it,\" he said gently.\n\"It makes me think of things far away, places and\nthings like that.\"\n\nOne night Tom Foster got drunk. That came about in a\ncurious way. He never had been drunk before, and indeed\nin all his life had never taken a drink of anything\nintoxicating, but he felt he needed to be drunk that\none time and so went and did it.\n\nIn Cincinnati, when he lived there, Tom had found out\nmany things, things about ugliness and crime and lust.\nIndeed, he knew more of these things than anyone else\nin Winesburg. The matter of sex in particular had\npresented itself to him in a quite horrible way and had\nmade a deep impression on his mind. He thought, after\nwhat he had seen of the women standing before the\nsqualid houses on cold nights and the look he had seen\nin the eyes of the men who stopped to talk to them,\nthat he would put sex altogether out of his own life.\nOne of the women of the neighborhood tempted him once\nand he went into a room with her. He never forgot the\nsmell of the room nor the greedy look that came into\nthe eyes of the woman. It sickened him and in a very\nterrible way left a scar on his soul. He had always\nbefore thought of women as quite innocent things, much\nlike his grandmother, but after that one experience in\nthe room he dismissed women from his mind. So gentle\nwas his nature that he could not hate anything and not\nbeing able to understand he decided to forget.\n\nAnd Tom did forget until he came to Winesburg. After he\nhad lived there for two years something began to stir\nin him. On all sides he saw youth making love and he\nwas himself a youth. Before he knew what had happened\nhe was in love also. He fell in love with Helen White,\ndaughter of the man for whom he had worked, and found\nhimself thinking of her at night.\n\nThat was a problem for Tom and he settled it in his own\nway. He let himself think of Helen White whenever her\nfigure came into his mind and only concerned himself\nwith the manner of his thoughts. He had a fight, a\nquiet determined little fight of his own, to keep his\ndesires in the channel where he thought they belonged,\nbut on the whole he was victorious.\n\nAnd then came the spring night when he got drunk. Tom\nwas wild on that night. He was like an innocent young\nbuck of the forest that has eaten of some maddening\nweed. The thing began, ran its course, and was ended in\none night, and you may be sure that no one in Winesburg\nwas any the worse for Tom's outbreak.\n\nIn the first place, the night was one to make a\nsensitive nature drunk. The trees along the residence\nstreets of the town were all newly clothed in soft\ngreen leaves, in the gardens behind the houses men were\nputtering about in vegetable gardens, and in the air\nthere was a hush, a waiting kind of silence very\nstirring to the blood.\n\nTom left his room on Duane Street just as the young\nnight began to make itself felt. First he walked\nthrough the streets, going softly and quietly along,\nthinking thoughts that he tried to put into words. He\nsaid that Helen White was a flame dancing in the air\nand that he was a little tree without leaves standing\nout sharply against the sky. Then he said that she was\na wind, a strong terrible wind, coming out of the\ndarkness of a stormy sea and that he was a boat left on\nthe shore of the sea by a fisherman.\n\nThat idea pleased the boy and he sauntered along\nplaying with it. He went into Main Street and sat on\nthe curbing before Wacker's tobacco store. For an hour\nhe lingered about listening to the talk of men, but it\ndid not interest him much and he slipped away. Then he\ndecided to get drunk and went into Willy's saloon and\nbought a bottle of whiskey. Putting the bottle into his\npocket, he walked out of town, wanting to be alone to\nthink more thoughts and to drink the whiskey.\n\nTom got drunk sitting on a bank of new grass beside the\nroad about a mile north of town. Before him was a white\nroad and at his back an apple orchard in full bloom. He\ntook a drink out of the bottle and then lay down on the\ngrass. He thought of mornings in Winesburg and of how\nthe stones in the graveled driveway by Banker White's\nhouse were wet with dew and glistened in the morning\nlight. He thought of the nights in the barn when it\nrained and he lay awake hearing the drumming of the\nraindrops and smelling the warm smell of horses and of\nhay. Then he thought of a storm that had gone roaring\nthrough Winesburg several days before and, his mind\ngoing back, he relived the night he had spent on the\ntrain with his grandmother when the two were coming\nfrom Cincinnati. Sharply he remembered how strange it\nhad seemed to sit quietly in the coach and to feel the\npower of the engine hurling the train along through the\nnight.\n\nTom got drunk in a very short time. He kept taking\ndrinks from the bottle as the thoughts visited him and\nwhen his head began to reel got up and walked along the\nroad going away from Winesburg. There was a bridge on\nthe road that ran out of Winesburg north to Lake Erie\nand the drunken boy made his way along the road to the\nbridge. There he sat down. He tried to drink again, but\nwhen he had taken the cork out of the bottle he became\nill and put it quickly back. His head was rocking back\nand forth and so he sat on the stone approach to the\nbridge and sighed. His head seemed to be flying about\nlike a pinwheel and then projecting itself off into\nspace and his arms and legs flopped helplessly about.\n\nAt eleven o'clock Tom got back into town. George\nWillard found him wandering about and took him into the\nEagle printshop. Then he became afraid that the drunken\nboy would make a mess on the floor and helped him into\nthe alleyway.\n\nThe reporter was confused by Tom Foster. The drunken\nboy talked of Helen White and said he had been with her\non the shore of a sea and had made love to her. George\nhad seen Helen White walking in the street with her\nfather during the evening and decided that Tom was out\nof his head. A sentiment concerning Helen White that\nlurked in his own heart flamed up and he became angry.\n\"Now you quit that,\" he said. \"I won't let Helen\nWhite's name be dragged into this. I won't let that\nhappen.\" He began shaking Tom's shoulder, trying to\nmake him understand. \"You quit it,\" he said again.\n\nFor three hours the two young men, thus strangely\nthrown together, stayed in the printshop. When he had a\nlittle recovered George took Tom for a walk. They went\ninto the country and sat on a log near the edge of a\nwood. Something in the still night drew them together\nand when the drunken boy's head began to clear they\ntalked.\n\n\"It was good to be drunk,\" Tom Foster said. \"It taught\nme something. I won't have to do it again. I will think\nmore dearly after this. You see how it is.\"\n\nGeorge Willard did not see, but his anger concerning\nHelen White passed and he felt drawn toward the pale,\nshaken boy as he had never before been drawn toward\nanyone. With motherly solicitude, he insisted that Tom\nget to his feet and walk about. Again they went back to\nthe printshop and sat in silence in the darkness.\n\nThe reporter could not get the purpose of Tom Foster's\naction straightened out in his mind. When Tom spoke\nagain of Helen White he again grew angry and began to\nscold. \"You quit that,\" he said sharply. \"You haven't\nbeen with her. What makes you say you have? What makes\nyou keep saying such things? Now you quit it, do you\nhear?\"\n\nTom was hurt. He couldn't quarrel with George Willard\nbecause he was incapable of quarreling, so he got up to\ngo away. When George Willard was insistent he put out\nhis hand, laying it on the older boy's arm, and tried\nto explain.\n\n\"Well,\" he said softly, \"I don't know how it was. I was\nhappy. You see how that was. Helen White made me happy\nand the night did too. I wanted to suffer, to be hurt\nsomehow. I thought that was what I should do. I wanted\nto suffer, you see, because everyone suffers and does\nwrong. I thought of a lot of things to do, but they\nwouldn't work. They all hurt someone else.\"\n\nTom Foster's voice arose, and for once in his life he\nbecame almost excited. \"It was like making love, that's\nwhat I mean,\" he explained. \"Don't you see how it is?\nIt hurt me to do what I did and made everything\nstrange. That's why I did it. I'm glad, too. It taught\nme something, that's it, that's what I wanted. Don't\nyou understand? I wanted to learn things, you see.\nThat's why I did it.\"\n\n\n\n\nDEATH\n\nThe stairway leading up to Doctor Reefy's office, in\nthe Heffner Block above the Paris Dry Goods store, was\nbut dimly lighted. At the head of the stairway hung a\nlamp with a dirty chimney that was fastened by a\nbracket to the wall. The lamp had a tin reflector,\nbrown with rust and covered with dust. The people who\nwent up the stairway followed with their feet the feet\nof many who had gone before. The soft boards of the\nstairs had yielded under the pressure of feet and deep\nhollows marked the way.\n\nAt the top of the stairway a turn to the right brought\nyou to the doctor's door. To the left was a dark\nhallway filled with rubbish. Old chairs, carpenter's\nhorses, step ladders and empty boxes lay in the\ndarkness waiting for shins to be barked. The pile of\nrubbish belonged to the Paris Dry Goods Company. When a\ncounter or a row of shelves in the store became\nuseless, clerks carried it up the stairway and threw it\non the pile.\n\nDoctor Reefy's office was as large as a barn. A stove\nwith a round paunch sat in the middle of the room.\nAround its base was piled sawdust, held in place by\nheavy planks nailed to the floor. By the door stood a\nhuge table that had once been a part of the furniture\nof Herrick's Clothing Store and that had been used for\ndisplaying custom-made clothes. It was covered with\nbooks, bottles, and surgical instruments. Near the edge\nof the table lay three or four apples left by John\nSpaniard, a tree nurseryman who was Doctor Reefy's\nfriend, and who had slipped the apples out of his\npocket as he came in at the door.\n\nAt middle age Doctor Reefy was tall and awkward. The\ngrey beard he later wore had not yet appeared, but on\nthe upper lip grew a brown mustache. He was not a\ngraceful man, as when he grew older, and was much\noccupied with the problem of disposing of his hands and\nfeet.\n\nOn summer afternoons, when she had been married many\nyears and when her son George was a boy of twelve or\nfourteen, Elizabeth Willard sometimes went up the worn\nsteps to Doctor Reefy's office. Already the woman's\nnaturally tall figure had begun to droop and to drag\nitself listlessly about. Ostensibly she went to see the\ndoctor because of her health, but on the half dozen\noccasions when she had been to see him the outcome of\nthe visits did not primarily concern her health. She\nand the doctor talked of that but they talked most of\nher life, of their two lives and of the ideas that had\ncome to them as they lived their lives in Winesburg.\n\nIn the big empty office the man and the woman sat\nlooking at each other and they were a good deal alike.\nTheir bodies were different, as were also the color of\ntheir eyes, the length of their noses, and the\ncircumstances of their existence, but something inside\nthem meant the same thing, wanted the same release,\nwould have left the same impression on the memory of an\nonlooker. Later, and when he grew older and married a\nyoung wife, the doctor often talked to her of the hours\nspent with the sick woman and expressed a good many\nthings he had been unable to express to Elizabeth. He\nwas almost a poet in his old age and his notion of what\nhappened took a poetic turn. \"I had come to the time in\nmy life when prayer became necessary and so I invented\ngods and prayed to them,\" he said. \"I did not say my\nprayers in words nor did I kneel down but sat perfectly\nstill in my chair. In the late afternoon when it was\nhot and quiet on Main Street or in the winter when the\ndays were gloomy, the gods came into the office and I\nthought no one knew about them. Then I found that this\nwoman Elizabeth knew, that she worshipped also the same\ngods. I have a notion that she came to the office\nbecause she thought the gods would be there but she was\nhappy to find herself not alone just the same. It was\nan experience that cannot be explained, although I\nsuppose it is always happening to men and women in all\nsorts of places.\"\n\n            *       *       *\n\nOn the summer afternoons when Elizabeth and the doctor\nsat in the office and talked of their two lives they\ntalked of other lives also. Sometimes the doctor made\nphilosophic epigrams. Then he chuckled with amusement.\nNow and then after a period of silence, a word was said\nor a hint given that strangely illuminated the life of\nthe speaker, a wish became a desire, or a dream, half\ndead, flared suddenly into life. For the most part the\nwords came from the woman and she said them without\nlooking at the man.\n\nEach time she came to see the doctor the hotel keeper's\nwife talked a little more freely and after an hour or\ntwo in his presence went down the stairway into Main\nStreet feeling renewed and strengthened against the\ndullness of her days. With something approaching a\ngirlhood swing to her body she walked along, but when\nshe had got back to her chair by the window of her room\nand when darkness had come on and a girl from the hotel\ndining room brought her dinner on a tray, she let it\ngrow cold. Her thoughts ran away to her girlhood with\nits passionate longing for adventure and she remembered\nthe arms of men that had held her when adventure was a\npossible thing for her. Particularly she remembered one\nwho had for a time been her lover and who in the moment\nof his passion had cried out to her more than a hundred\ntimes, saying the same words madly over and over: \"You\ndear! You dear! You lovely dear!\" The words, she\nthought, expressed something she would have liked to\nhave achieved in life.\n\nIn her room in the shabby old hotel the sick wife of\nthe hotel keeper began to weep and, putting her hands\nto her face, rocked back and forth. The words of her\none friend, Doctor Reefy, rang in her ears. \"Love is\nlike a wind stirring the grass beneath trees on a black\nnight,\" he had said. \"You must not try to make love\ndefinite. It is the divine accident of life. If you try\nto be definite and sure about it and to live beneath\nthe trees, where soft night winds blow, the long hot\nday of disappointment comes swiftly and the gritty dust\nfrom passing wagons gathers upon lips inflamed and made\ntender by kisses.\"\n\nElizabeth Willard could not remember her mother who had\ndied when she was but five years old. Her girlhood had\nbeen lived in the most haphazard manner imaginable. Her\nfather was a man who had wanted to be let alone and the\naffairs of the hotel would not let him alone. He also\nhad lived and died a sick man. Every day he arose with\na cheerful face, but by ten o'clock in the morning all\nthe joy had gone out of his heart. When a guest\ncomplained of the fare in the hotel dining room or one\nof the girls who made up the beds got married and went\naway, he stamped on the floor and swore. At night when\nhe went to bed he thought of his daughter growing up\namong the stream of people that drifted in and out of\nthe hotel and was overcome with sadness. As the girl\ngrew older and began to walk out in the evening with\nmen he wanted to talk to her, but when he tried was not\nsuccessful. He always forgot what he wanted to say and\nspent the time complaining of his own affairs.\n\nIn her girlhood and young womanhood Elizabeth had tried\nto be a real adventurer in life. At eighteen life had\nso gripped her that she was no longer a virgin but,\nalthough she had a half dozen lovers before she married\nTom Willard, she had never entered upon an adventure\nprompted by desire alone. Like all the women in the\nworld, she wanted a real lover. Always there was\nsomething she sought blindly, passionately, some hidden\nwonder in life. The tall beautiful girl with the\nswinging stride who had walked under the trees with men\nwas forever putting out her hand into the darkness and\ntrying to get hold of some other hand. In all the\nbabble of words that fell from the lips of the men with\nwhom she adventured she was trying to find what would\nbe for her the true word.\n\nElizabeth had married Tom Willard, a clerk in her\nfather's hotel, because he was at hand and wanted to\nmarry at the time when the determination to marry came\nto her. For a while, like most young girls, she thought\nmarriage would change the face of life. If there was in\nher mind a doubt of the outcome of the marriage with\nTom she brushed it aside. Her father was ill and near\ndeath at the time and she was perplexed because of the\nmeaningless outcome of an affair in which she had just\nbeen involved. Other girls of her age in Winesburg were\nmarrying men she had always known, grocery clerks or\nyoung farmers. In the evening they walked in Main\nStreet with their husbands and when she passed they\nsmiled happily. She began to think that the fact of\nmarriage might be full of some hidden significance.\nYoung wives with whom she talked spoke softly and\nshyly. \"It changes things to have a man of your own,\"\nthey said.\n\nOn the evening before her marriage the perplexed girl\nhad a talk with her father. Later she wondered if the\nhours alone with the sick man had not led to her\ndecision to marry. The father talked of his life and\nadvised the daughter to avoid being led into another\nsuch muddle. He abused Tom Willard, and that led\nElizabeth to come to the clerk's defense. The sick man\nbecame excited and tried to get out of bed. When she\nwould not let him walk about he began to complain.\n\"I've never been let alone,\" he said. \"Although I've\nworked hard I've not made the hotel pay. Even now I owe\nmoney at the bank. You'll find that out when I'm gone.\"\n\nThe voice of the sick man became tense with\nearnestness. Being unable to arise, he put out his hand\nand pulled the girl's head down beside his own.\n\"There's a way out,\" he whispered. \"Don't marry Tom\nWillard or anyone else here in Winesburg. There is\neight hundred dollars in a tin box in my trunk. Take it\nand go away.\"\n\nAgain the sick man's voice became querulous. \"You've\ngot to promise,\" he declared. \"If you won't promise not\nto marry, give me your word that you'll never tell Tom\nabout the money. It is mine and if I give it to you\nI've the right to make that demand. Hide it away. It is\nto make up to you for my failure as a father. Some time\nit may prove to be a door, a great open door to you.\nCome now, I tell you I'm about to die, give me your\npromise.\"\n\n            *       *       *\n\nIn Doctor Reefy's office, Elizabeth, a tired gaunt old\nwoman at forty-one, sat in a chair near the stove and\nlooked at the floor. By a small desk near the window\nsat the doctor. His hands played with a lead pencil\nthat lay on the desk. Elizabeth talked of her life as a\nmarried woman. She became impersonal and forgot her\nhusband, only using him as a lay figure to give point\nto her tale. \"And then I was married and it did not\nturn out at all,\" she said bitterly. \"As soon as I had\ngone into it I began to be afraid. Perhaps I knew too\nmuch before and then perhaps I found out too much\nduring my first night with him. I don't remember.\n\n\"What a fool I was. When father gave me the money and\ntried to talk me out of the thought of marriage, I\nwould not listen. I thought of what the girls who were\nmarried had said of it and I wanted marriage also. It\nwasn't Tom I wanted, it was marriage. When father went\nto sleep I leaned out of the window and thought of the\nlife I had led. I didn't want to be a bad woman. The\ntown was full of stories about me. I even began to be\nafraid Tom would change his mind.\"\n\nThe woman's voice began to quiver with excitement. To\nDoctor Reefy, who without realizing what was happening\nhad begun to love her, there came an odd illusion. He\nthought that as she talked the woman's body was\nchanging, that she was becoming younger, straighter,\nstronger. When he could not shake off the illusion his\nmind gave it a professional twist. \"It is good for both\nher body and her mind, this talking,\" he muttered.\n\nThe woman began telling of an incident that had\nhappened one afternoon a few months after her marriage.\nHer voice became steadier. \"In the late afternoon I\nwent for a drive alone,\" she said. \"I had a buggy and a\nlittle grey pony I kept in Moyer's Livery. Tom was\npainting and repapering rooms in the hotel. He wanted\nmoney and I was trying to make up my mind to tell him\nabout the eight hundred dollars father had given to me.\nI couldn't decide to do it. I didn't like him well\nenough. There was always paint on his hands and face\nduring those days and he smelled of paint. He was\ntrying to fix up the old hotel, and make it new and\nsmart.\"\n\nThe excited woman sat up very straight in her chair and\nmade a quick girlish movement with her hand as she told\nof the drive alone on the spring afternoon. \"It was\ncloudy and a storm threatened,\" she said. \"Black clouds\nmade the green of the trees and the grass stand out so\nthat the colors hurt my eyes. I went out Trunion Pike a\nmile or more and then turned into a side road. The\nlittle horse went quickly along up hill and down. I was\nimpatient. Thoughts came and I wanted to get away from\nmy thoughts. I began to beat the horse. The black\nclouds settled down and it began to rain. I wanted to\ngo at a terrible speed, to drive on and on forever. I\nwanted to get out of town, out of my clothes, out of my\nmarriage, out of my body, out of everything. I almost\nkilled the horse, making him run, and when he could not\nrun any more I got out of the buggy and ran afoot into\nthe darkness until I fell and hurt my side. I wanted to\nrun away from everything but I wanted to run towards\nsomething too. Don't you see, dear, how it was?\"\n\nElizabeth sprang out of the chair and began to walk\nabout in the office. She walked as Doctor Reefy thought\nhe had never seen anyone walk before. To her whole body\nthere was a swing, a rhythm that intoxicated him. When\nshe came and knelt on the floor beside his chair he\ntook her into his arms and began to kiss her\npassionately. \"I cried all the way home,\" she said, as\nshe tried to continue the story of her wild ride, but\nhe did not listen. \"You dear! You lovely dear! Oh you\nlovely dear!\" he muttered and thought he held in his\narms not the tired-out woman of forty-one but a lovely\nand innocent girl who had been able by some miracle to\nproject herself out of the husk of the body of the\ntired-out woman.\n\nDoctor Reefy did not see the woman he had held in his\narms again until after her death. On the summer\nafternoon in the office when he was on the point of\nbecoming her lover a half grotesque little incident\nbrought his love-making quickly to an end. As the man\nand woman held each other tightly heavy feet came\ntramping up the office stairs. The two sprang to their\nfeet and stood listening and trembling. The noise on\nthe stairs was made by a clerk from the Paris Dry Goods\nCompany. With a loud bang he threw an empty box on the\npile of rubbish in the hallway and then went heavily\ndown the stairs. Elizabeth followed him almost\nimmediately. The thing that had come to life in her as\nshe talked to her one friend died suddenly. She was\nhysterical, as was also Doctor Reefy, and did not want\nto continue the talk. Along the street she went with\nthe blood still singing in her body, but when she\nturned out of Main Street and saw ahead the lights of\nthe New Willard House, she began to tremble and her\nknees shook so that for a moment she thought she would\nfall in the street.\n\nThe sick woman spent the last few months of her life\nhungering for death. Along the road of death she went,\nseeking, hungering. She personified the figure of death\nand made him now a strong black-haired youth running\nover hills, now a stern quiet man marked and scarred by\nthe business of living. In the darkness of her room she\nput out her hand, thrusting it from under the covers of\nher bed, and she thought that death like a living thing\nput out his hand to her. \"Be patient, lover,\" she\nwhispered. \"Keep yourself young and beautiful and be\npatient.\"\n\nOn the evening when disease laid its heavy hand upon\nher and defeated her plans for telling her son George\nof the eight hundred dollars hidden away, she got out\nof bed and crept half across the room pleading with\ndeath for another hour of life. \"Wait, dear! The boy!\nThe boy! The boy!\" she pleaded as she tried with all of\nher strength to fight off the arms of the lover she had\nwanted so earnestly.\n\n            *       *       *\n\nElizabeth died one day in March in the year when her\nson George became eighteen, and the young man had but\nlittle sense of the meaning of her death. Only time\ncould give him that. For a month he had seen her lying\nwhite and still and speechless in her bed, and then one\nafternoon the doctor stopped him in the hallway and\nsaid a few words.\n\nThe young man went into his own room and closed the\ndoor. He had a queer empty feeling in the region of his\nstomach. For a moment he sat staring at, the floor and\nthen jumping up went for a walk. Along the station\nplatform he went, and around through residence streets\npast the high-school building, thinking almost entirely\nof his own affairs. The notion of death could not get\nhold of him and he was in fact a little annoyed that\nhis mother had died on that day. He had just received a\nnote from Helen White, the daughter of the town banker,\nin answer to one from him. \"Tonight I could have gone\nto see her and now it will have to be put off,\" he\nthought half angrily.\n\nElizabeth died on a Friday afternoon at three o'clock.\nIt had been cold and rainy in the morning but in the\nafternoon the sun came out. Before she died she lay\nparalyzed for six days unable to speak or move and with\nonly her mind and her eyes alive. For three of the six\ndays she struggled, thinking of her boy, trying to say\nsome few words in regard to his future, and in her eyes\nthere was an appeal so touching that all who saw it\nkept the memory of the dying woman in their minds for\nyears. Even Tom Willard, who had always half resented\nhis wife, forgot his resentment and the tears ran out\nof his eyes and lodged in his mustache. The mustache\nhad begun to turn grey and Tom colored it with dye.\nThere was oil in the preparation he used for the\npurpose and the tears, catching in the mustache and\nbeing brushed away by his hand, formed a fine mist-like\nvapor. In his grief Tom Willard's face looked like the\nface of a little dog that has been out a long time in\nbitter weather.\n\nGeorge came home along Main Street at dark on the day\nof his mother's death and, after going to his own room\nto brush his hair and clothes, went along the hallway\nand into the room where the body lay. There was a\ncandle on the dressing table by the door and Doctor\nReefy sat in a chair by the bed. The doctor arose and\nstarted to go out. He put out his hand as though to\ngreet the younger man and then awkwardly drew it back\nagain. The air of the room was heavy with the presence\nof the two self-conscious human beings, and the man\nhurried away.\n\nThe dead woman's son sat down in a chair and looked at\nthe floor. He again thought of his own affairs and\ndefinitely decided he would make a change in his life,\nthat he would leave Winesburg. \"I will go to some city.\nPerhaps I can get a job on some newspaper,\" he thought,\nand then his mind turned to the girl with whom he was\nto have spent this evening and again he was half angry\nat the turn of events that had prevented his going to\nher.\n\nIn the dimly lighted room with the dead woman the young\nman began to have thoughts. His mind played with\nthoughts of life as his mother's mind had played with\nthe thought of death. He closed his eyes and imagined\nthat the red young lips of Helen White touched his own\nlips. His body trembled and his hands shook. And then\nsomething happened. The boy sprang to his feet and\nstood stiffly. He looked at the figure of the dead\nwoman under the sheets and shame for his thoughts swept\nover him so that he began to weep. A new notion came\ninto his mind and he turned and looked guiltily about\nas though afraid he would be observed.\n\nGeorge Willard became possessed of a madness to lift\nthe sheet from the body of his mother and look at her\nface. The thought that had come into his mind gripped\nhim terribly. He became convinced that not his mother\nbut someone else lay in the bed before him. The\nconviction was so real that it was almost unbearable.\nThe body under the sheets was long and in death looked\nyoung and graceful. To the boy, held by some strange\nfancy, it was unspeakably lovely. The feeling that the\nbody before him was alive, that in another moment a\nlovely woman would spring out of the bed and confront\nhim, became so overpowering that he could not bear the\nsuspense. Again and again he put out his hand. Once he\ntouched and half lifted the white sheet that covered\nher, but his courage failed and he, like Doctor Reefy,\nturned and went out of the room. In the hallway outside\nthe door he stopped and trembled so that he had to put\na hand against the wall to support himself. \"That's not\nmy mother. That's not my mother in there,\" he whispered\nto himself and again his body shook with fright and\nuncertainty. When Aunt Elizabeth Swift, who had come to\nwatch over the body, came out of an adjoining room he\nput his hand into hers and began to sob, shaking his\nhead from side to side, half blind with grief. \"My\nmother is dead,\" he said, and then forgetting the woman\nhe turned and stared at the door through which he had\njust come. \"The dear, the dear, oh the lovely dear,\"\nthe boy, urged by some impulse outside himself,\nmuttered aloud.\n\nAs for the eight hundred dollars the dead woman had\nkept hidden so long and that was to give George Willard\nhis start in the city, it lay in the tin box behind the\nplaster by the foot of his mother's bed. Elizabeth had\nput it there a week after her marriage, breaking the\nplaster away with a stick. Then she got one of the\nworkmen her husband was at that time employing about\nthe hotel to mend the wall. \"I jammed the corner of the\nbed against it,\" she had explained to her husband,\nunable at the moment to give up her dream of release,\nthe release that after all came to her but twice in her\nlife, in the moments when her lovers Death and Doctor\nReefy held her in their arms.\n\n\n\n\nSOPHISTICATION\n\nIt was early evening of a day in the late fall and the\nWinesburg County Fair had brought crowds of country\npeople into town. The day had been clear and the night\ncame on warm and pleasant. On the Trunion Pike, where\nthe road after it left town stretched away between\nberry fields now covered with dry brown leaves, the\ndust from passing wagons arose in clouds. Children,\ncurled into little balls, slept on the straw scattered\non wagon beds. Their hair was full of dust and their\nfingers black and sticky. The dust rolled away over the\nfields and the departing sun set it ablaze with colors.\n\nIn the main street of Winesburg crowds filled the\nstores and the sidewalks. Night came on, horses\nwhinnied, the clerks in the stores ran madly about,\nchildren became lost and cried lustily, an American\ntown worked terribly at the task of amusing itself.\n\nPushing his way through the crowds in Main Street,\nyoung George Willard concealed himself in the stairway\nleading to Doctor Reefy's office and looked at the\npeople. With feverish eyes he watched the faces\ndrifting past under the store lights. Thoughts kept\ncoming into his head and he did not want to think. He\nstamped impatiently on the wooden steps and looked\nsharply about. \"Well, is she going to stay with him all\nday? Have I done all this waiting for nothing?\" he\nmuttered.\n\nGeorge Willard, the Ohio village boy, was fast growing\ninto manhood and new thoughts had been coming into his\nmind. All that day, amid the jam of people at the Fair,\nhe had gone about feeling lonely. He was about to leave\nWinesburg to go away to some city where he hoped to get\nwork on a city newspaper and he felt grown up. The mood\nthat had taken possession of him was a thing known to\nmen and unknown to boys. He felt old and a little\ntired. Memories awoke in him. To his mind his new sense\nof maturity set him apart, made of him a half-tragic\nfigure. He wanted someone to understand the feeling\nthat had taken possession of him after his mother's\ndeath.\n\nThere is a time in the life of every boy when he for\nthe first time takes the backward view of life. Perhaps\nthat is the moment when he crosses the line into\nmanhood. The boy is walking through the street of his\ntown. He is thinking of the future and of the figure he\nwill cut in the world. Ambitions and regrets awake\nwithin him. Suddenly something happens; he stops under\na tree and waits as for a voice calling his name.\nGhosts of old things creep into his consciousness; the\nvoices outside of himself whisper a message concerning\nthe limitations of life. From being quite sure of\nhimself and his future he becomes not at all sure. If\nhe be an imaginative boy a door is torn open and for the\nfirst time he looks out upon the world, seeing, as\nthough they marched in procession before him, the\ncountless figures of men who before his time have come\nout of nothingness into the world, lived their lives\nand again disappeared into nothingness. The sadness of\nsophistication has come to the boy. With a little gasp\nhe sees himself as merely a leaf blown by the wind\nthrough the streets of his village. He knows that in\nspite of all the stout talk of his fellows he must live\nand die in uncertainty, a thing blown by the winds, a\nthing destined like corn to wilt in the sun. He shivers\nand looks eagerly about. The eighteen years he has\nlived seem but a moment, a breathing space in the long\nmarch of humanity. Already he hears death calling. With\nall his heart he wants to come close to some other\nhuman, touch someone with his hands, be touched by the\nhand of another. If he prefers that the other be a\nwoman, that is because he believes that a woman will be\ngentle, that she will understand. He wants, most of\nall, understanding.\n\nWhen the moment of sophistication came to George\nWillard his mind turned to Helen White, the Winesburg\nbanker's daughter. Always he had been conscious of the\ngirl growing into womanhood as he grew into manhood.\nOnce on a summer night when he was eighteen, he had\nwalked with her on a country road and in her presence\nhad given way to an impulse to boast, to make himself\nappear big and significant in her eyes. Now he wanted\nto see her for another purpose. He wanted to tell her\nof the new impulses that had come to him. He had tried\nto make her think of him as a man when he knew nothing\nof manhood and now he wanted to be with her and to try\nto make her feel the change he believed had taken place\nin his nature.\n\nAs for Helen White, she also had come to a period of\nchange. What George felt, she in her young woman's way\nfelt also. She was no longer a girl and hungered to\nreach into the grace and beauty of womanhood. She had\ncome home from Cleveland, where she was attending\ncollege, to spend a day at the Fair. She also had begun\nto have memories. During the day she sat in the\ngrand-stand with a young man, one of the instructors\nfrom the college, who was a guest of her mother's. The\nyoung man was of a pedantic turn of mind and she felt\nat once he would not do for her purpose. At the Fair\nshe was glad to be seen in his company as he was well\ndressed and a stranger. She knew that the fact of his\npresence would create an impression. During the day she\nwas happy, but when night came on she began to grow\nrestless. She wanted to drive the instructor away, to\nget out of his presence. While they sat together in the\ngrand-stand and while the eyes of former schoolmates\nwere upon them, she paid so much attention to her\nescort that he grew interested. \"A scholar needs money.\nI should marry a woman with money,\" he mused.\n\nHelen White was thinking of George Willard even as he\nwandered gloomily through the crowds thinking of her.\nShe remembered the summer evening when they had walked\ntogether and wanted to walk with him again. She thought\nthat the months she had spent in the city, the going to\ntheaters and the seeing of great crowds wandering in\nlighted thoroughfares, had changed her profoundly. She\nwanted him to feel and be conscious of the change in\nher nature.\n\nThe summer evening together that had left its mark on\nthe memory of both the young man and woman had, when\nlooked at quite sensibly, been rather stupidly spent.\nThey had walked out of town along a country road. Then\nthey had stopped by a fence near a field of young corn\nand George had taken off his coat and let it hang on\nhis arm. \"Well, I've stayed here in\nWinesburg--yes--I've not yet gone away but I'm growing\nup,\" he had said. \"I've been reading books and I've\nbeen thinking. I'm going to try to amount to something\nin life.\n\n\"Well,\" he explained, \"that isn't the point. Perhaps\nI'd better quit talking.\"\n\nThe confused boy put his hand on the girl's arm. His\nvoice trembled. The two started to walk back along the\nroad toward town. In his desperation George boasted,\n\"I'm going to be a big man, the biggest that ever lived\nhere in Winesburg,\" he declared. \"I want you to do\nsomething, I don't know what. Perhaps it is none of my\nbusiness. I want you to try to be different from other\nwomen. You see the point. It's none of my business I\ntell you. I want you to be a beautiful woman. You see\nwhat I want.\"\n\nThe boy's voice failed and in silence the two came back\ninto town and went along the street to Helen White's\nhouse. At the gate he tried to say something\nimpressive. Speeches he had thought out came into his\nhead, but they seemed utterly pointless. \"I thought--I\nused to think--I had it in my mind you would marry Seth\nRichmond. Now I know you won't,\" was all he could find\nto say as she went through the gate and toward the door\nof her house.\n\nOn the warm fall evening as he stood in the stairway\nand looked at the crowd drifting through Main Street,\nGeorge thought of the talk beside the field of young\ncorn and was ashamed of the figure he had made of\nhimself. In the street the people surged up and down\nlike cattle confined in a pen. Buggies and wagons\nalmost filled the narrow thoroughfare. A band played\nand small boys raced along the sidewalk, diving between\nthe legs of men. Young men with shining red faces\nwalked awkwardly about with girls on their arms. In a\nroom above one of the stores, where a dance was to be\nheld, the fiddlers tuned their instruments. The broken\nsounds floated down through an open window and out\nacross the murmur of voices and the loud blare of the\nhorns of the band. The medley of sounds got on young\nWillard's nerves. Everywhere, on all sides, the sense\nof crowding, moving life closed in about him. He wanted\nto run away by himself and think. \"If she wants to stay\nwith that fellow she may. Why should I care? What\ndifference does it make to me?\" he growled and went\nalong Main Street and through Hern's Grocery into a\nside street.\n\nGeorge felt so utterly lonely and dejected that he\nwanted to weep but pride made him walk rapidly along,\nswinging his arms. He came to Wesley Moyer's livery\nbarn and stopped in the shadows to listen to a group of\nmen who talked of a race Wesley's stallion, Tony Tip,\nhad won at the Fair during the afternoon. A crowd had\ngathered in front of the barn and before the crowd\nwalked Wesley, prancing up and down boasting. He held a\nwhip in his hand and kept tapping the ground. Little\npuffs of dust arose in the lamplight. \"Hell, quit your\ntalking,\" Wesley exclaimed. \"I wasn't afraid, I knew I\nhad 'em beat all the time. I wasn't afraid.\"\n\nOrdinarily George Willard would have been intensely\ninterested in the boasting of Moyer, the horseman. Now\nit made him angry. He turned and hurried away along the\nstreet. \"Old windbag,\" he sputtered. \"Why does he want\nto be bragging? Why don't he shut up?\"\n\nGeorge went into a vacant lot and, as he hurried along,\nfell over a pile of rubbish. A nail protruding from an\nempty barrel tore his trousers. He sat down on the\nground and swore. With a pin he mended the torn place\nand then arose and went on. \"I'll go to Helen White's\nhouse, that's what I'll do. I'll walk right in. I'll\nsay that I want to see her. I'll walk right in and sit\ndown, that's what I'll do,\" he declared, climbing over\na fence and beginning to run.\n\n            *       *       *\n\nOn the veranda of Banker White's house Helen was\nrestless and distraught. The instructor sat between the\nmother and daughter. His talk wearied the girl.\nAlthough he had also been raised in an Ohio town, the\ninstructor began to put on the airs of the city. He\nwanted to appear cosmopolitan. \"I like the chance you\nhave given me to study the background out of which most\nof our girls come,\" he declared. \"It was good of you,\nMrs. White, to have me down for the day.\" He turned to\nHelen and laughed. \"Your life is still bound up with\nthe life of this town?\" he asked. \"There are people\nhere in whom you are interested?\" To the girl his voice\nsounded pompous and heavy.\n\nHelen arose and went into the house. At the door\nleading to a garden at the back she stopped and stood\nlistening. Her mother began to talk. \"There is no one\nhere fit to associate with a girl of Helen's breeding,\"\nshe said.\n\nHelen ran down a flight of stairs at the back of the\nhouse and into the garden. In the darkness she stopped\nand stood trembling. It seemed to her that the world\nwas full of meaningless people saying words. Afire with\neagerness she ran through a garden gate and, turning a\ncorner by the banker's barn, went into a little side\nstreet. \"George! Where are you, George?\" she cried,\nfilled with nervous excitement. She stopped running,\nand leaned against a tree to laugh hysterically. Along\nthe dark little street came George Willard, still\nsaying words. \"I'm going to walk right into her house.\nI'll go right in and sit down,\" he declared as he came\nup to her. He stopped and stared stupidly. \"Come on,\"\nhe said and took hold of her hand. With hanging heads\nthey walked away along the street under the trees. Dry\nleaves rustled under foot. Now that he had found her\nGeorge wondered what he had better do and say.\n\n            *       *       *\n\nAt the upper end of the Fair Ground, in Winesburg,\nthere is a half decayed old grand-stand. It has never\nbeen painted and the boards are all warped out of\nshape. The Fair Ground stands on top of a low hill\nrising out of the valley of Wine Creek and from the\ngrand-stand one can see at night, over a cornfield, the\nlights of the town reflected against the sky.\n\nGeorge and Helen climbed the hill to the Fair Ground,\ncoming by the path past Waterworks Pond. The feeling of\nloneliness and isolation that had come to the young man\nin the crowded streets of his town was both broken and\nintensified by the presence of Helen. What he felt was\nreflected in her.\n\nIn youth there are always two forces fighting in\npeople. The warm unthinking little animal struggles\nagainst the thing that reflects and remembers, and the\nolder, the more sophisticated thing had possession of\nGeorge Willard. Sensing his mood, Helen walked beside\nhim filled with respect. When they got to the\ngrand-stand they climbed up under the roof and sat down\non one of the long bench-like seats.\n\nThere is something memorable in the experience to be\nhad by going into a fair ground that stands at the edge\nof a Middle Western town on a night after the annual\nfair has been held. The sensation is one never to be\nforgotten. On all sides are ghosts, not of the dead,\nbut of living people. Here, during the day just passed,\nhave come the people pouring in from the town and the\ncountry around. Farmers with their wives and children\nand all the people from the hundreds of little frame\nhouses have gathered within these board walls. Young\ngirls have laughed and men with beards have talked of\nthe affairs of their lives. The place has been filled\nto overflowing with life. It has itched and squirmed\nwith life and now it is night and the life has all gone\naway. The silence is almost terrifying. One conceals\noneself standing silently beside the trunk of a tree\nand what there is of a reflective tendency in his\nnature is intensified. One shudders at the thought of\nthe meaninglessness of life while at the same instant,\nand if the people of the town are his people, one loves\nlife so intensely that tears come into the eyes.\n\nIn the darkness under the roof of the grand-stand,\nGeorge Willard sat beside Helen White and felt very\nkeenly his own insignificance in the scheme of\nexistence. Now that he had come out of town where the\npresence of the people stirring about, busy with a\nmultitude of affairs, had been so irritating, the\nirritation was all gone. The presence of Helen renewed\nand refreshed him. It was as though her woman's hand\nwas assisting him to make some minute readjustment of\nthe machinery of his life. He began to think of the\npeople in the town where he had always lived with\nsomething like reverence. He had reverence for Helen.\nHe wanted to love and to be loved by her, but he did\nnot want at the moment to be confused by her womanhood.\nIn the darkness he took hold of her hand and when she\ncrept close put a hand on her shoulder. A wind began to\nblow and he shivered. With all his strength he tried to\nhold and to understand the mood that had come upon him.\nIn that high place in the darkness the two oddly\nsensitive human atoms held each other tightly and\nwaited. In the mind of each was the same thought. \"I\nhave come to this lonely place and here is this other,\"\nwas the substance of the thing felt.\n\nIn Winesburg the crowded day had run itself out into\nthe long night of the late fall. Farm horses jogged\naway along lonely country roads pulling their portion\nof weary people. Clerks began to bring samples of goods\nin off the sidewalks and lock the doors of stores. In\nthe Opera House a crowd had gathered to see a show and\nfurther down Main Street the fiddlers, their\ninstruments tuned, sweated and worked to keep the feet\nof youth flying over a dance floor.\n\nIn the darkness in the grand-stand Helen White and\nGeorge Willard remained silent. Now and then the spell\nthat held them was broken and they turned and tried in\nthe dim light to see into each other's eyes. They\nkissed but that impulse did not last. At the upper end\nof the Fair Ground a half dozen men worked over horses\nthat had raced during the afternoon. The men had built\na fire and were heating kettles of water. Only their\nlegs could be seen as they passed back and forth in the\nlight. When the wind blew the little flames of the fire\ndanced crazily about.\n\nGeorge and Helen arose and walked away into the\ndarkness. They went along a path past a field of corn\nthat had not yet been cut. The wind whispered among the\ndry corn blades. For a moment during the walk back into\ntown the spell that held them was broken. When they had\ncome to the crest of Waterworks Hill they stopped by a\ntree and George again put his hands on the girl's\nshoulders. She embraced him eagerly and then again they\ndrew quickly back from that impulse. They stopped\nkissing and stood a little apart. Mutual respect grew\nbig in them. They were both embarrassed and to relieve\ntheir embarrassment dropped into the animalism of\nyouth. They laughed and began to pull and haul at each\nother. In some way chastened and purified by the mood\nthey had been in, they became, not man and woman, not\nboy and girl, but excited little animals.\n\nIt was so they went down the hill. In the darkness\nthey played like two splendid young things in a young\nworld. Once, running swiftly forward, Helen tripped\nGeorge and he fell. He squirmed and shouted. Shaking\nwith laughter, he roiled down the hill. Helen ran after\nhim. For just a moment she stopped in the darkness.\nThere was no way of knowing what woman's thoughts went\nthrough her mind but, when the bottom of the hill was\nreached and she came up to the boy, she took his arm\nand walked beside him in dignified silence. For some\nreason they could not have explained they had both got\nfrom their silent evening together the thing needed.\nMan or boy, woman or girl, they had for a moment taken\nhold of the thing that makes the mature life of men and\nwomen in the modern world possible.\n\n\n\nDEPARTURE\n\nYoung George Willard got out of bed at four in the\nmorning. It was April and the young tree leaves were\njust coming out of their buds. The trees along the\nresidence streets in Winesburg are maple and the seeds\nare winged. When the wind blows they whirl crazily\nabout, filling the air and making a carpet underfoot.\n\nGeorge came downstairs into the hotel office carrying a\nbrown leather bag. His trunk was packed for departure.\nSince two o'clock he had been awake thinking of the\njourney he was about to take and wondering what he\nwould find at the end of his journey. The boy who slept\nin the hotel office lay on a cot by the door. His mouth\nwas open and he snored lustily. George crept past the\ncot and went out into the silent deserted main street.\nThe east was pink with the dawn and long streaks of\nlight climbed into the sky where a few stars still\nshone.\n\nBeyond the last house on Trunion Pike in Winesburg\nthere is a great stretch of open fields. The fields are\nowned by farmers who live in town and drive homeward at\nevening along Trunion Pike in light creaking wagons. In\nthe fields are planted berries and small fruits. In the\nlate afternoon in the hot summers when the road and the\nfields are covered with dust, a smoky haze lies over\nthe great flat basin of land. To look across it is like\nlooking out across the sea. In the spring when the land\nis green the effect is somewhat different. The land\nbecomes a wide green billiard table on which tiny human\ninsects toil up and down.\n\nAll through his boyhood and young manhood George\nWillard had been in the habit of walking on Trunion\nPike. He had been in the midst of the great open place\non winter nights when it was covered with snow and only\nthe moon looked down at him; he had been there in the\nfall when bleak winds blew and on summer evenings when\nthe air vibrated with the song of insects. On the April\nmorning he wanted to go there again, to walk again in\nthe silence. He did walk to where the road dipped down\nby a little stream two miles from town and then turned\nand walked silently back again. When he got to Main\nStreet clerks were sweeping the sidewalks before the\nstores. \"Hey, you George. How does it feel to be going\naway?\" they asked.\n\nThe westbound train leaves Winesburg at seven\nforty-five in the morning. Tom Little is conductor. His\ntrain runs from Cleveland to where it connects with a\ngreat trunk line railroad with terminals in Chicago and\nNew York. Tom has what in railroad circles is called an\n\"easy run.\" Every evening he returns to his family. In\nthe fall and spring he spends his Sundays fishing in\nLake Erie. He has a round red face and small blue eyes.\nHe knows the people in the towns along his railroad\nbetter than a city man knows the people who live in his\napartment building.\n\nGeorge came down the little incline from the New\nWillard House at seven o'clock. Tom Willard carried his\nbag. The son had become taller than the father.\n\nOn the station platform everyone shook the young man's\nhand. More than a dozen people waited about. Then they\ntalked of their own affairs. Even Will Henderson, who\nwas lazy and often slept until nine, had got out of\nbed. George was embarrassed. Gertrude Wilmot, a tall\nthin woman of fifty who worked in the Winesburg post\noffice, came along the station platform. She had never\nbefore paid any attention to George. Now she stopped\nand put out her hand. In two words she voiced what\neveryone felt. \"Good luck,\" she said sharply and then\nturning went on her way.\n\nWhen the train came into the station George felt\nrelieved. He scampered hurriedly aboard. Helen White\ncame running along Main Street hoping to have a parting\nword with him, but he had found a seat and did not see\nher. When the train started Tom Little punched his\nticket, grinned and, although he knew George well and\nknew on what adventure he was just setting out, made no\ncomment. Tom had seen a thousand George Willards go out\nof their towns to the city. It was a commonplace enough\nincident with him. In the smoking car there was a man\nwho had just invited Tom to go on a fishing trip to\nSandusky Bay. He wanted to accept the invitation and\ntalk over details.\n\nGeorge glanced up and down the car to be sure no one\nwas looking, then took out his pocket-book and counted\nhis money. His mind was occupied with a desire not to\nappear green. Almost the last words his father had said\nto him concerned the matter of his behavior when he got\nto the city. \"Be a sharp one,\" Tom Willard had said.\n\"Keep your eyes on your money. Be awake. That's the\nticket. Don't let anyone think you're a greenhorn.\"\n\nAfter George counted his money he looked out of the\nwindow and was surprised to see that the train was\nstill in Winesburg.\n\nThe young man, going out of his town to meet the\nadventure of life, began to think but he did not think\nof anything very big or dramatic. Things like his\nmother's death, his departure from Winesburg, the\nuncertainty of his future life in the city, the serious\nand larger aspects of his life did not come into his\nmind.\n\nHe thought of little things--Turk Smollet wheeling\nboards through the main street of his town in the\nmorning, a tall woman, beautifully gowned, who had once\nstayed overnight at his father's hotel, Butch Wheeler\nthe lamp lighter of Winesburg hurrying through the\nstreets on a summer evening and holding a torch in his\nhand, Helen White standing by a window in the Winesburg\npost office and putting a stamp on an envelope.\n\nThe young man's mind was carried away by his growing\npassion for dreams. One looking at him would not have\nthought him particularly sharp. With the recollection\nof little things occupying his mind he closed his eyes\nand leaned back in the car seat. He stayed that way for\na long time and when he aroused himself and again\nlooked out of the car window the town of Winesburg had\ndisappeared and his life there had become but a\nbackground on which to paint the dreams of his manhood.",
