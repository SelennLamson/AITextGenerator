 "text": "THE EUROPEANS\n\nby Henry James\n\n\n\nCONTENTS\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nA narrow grave-yard in the heart of a bustling, indifferent city, seen\nfrom the windows of a gloomy-looking inn, is at no time an object of\nenlivening suggestion; and the spectacle is not at its best when the\nmouldy tombstones and funereal umbrage have received the ineffectual\nrefreshment of a dull, moist snow-fall. If, while the air is thickened\nby this frosty drizzle, the calendar should happen to indicate that the\nblessed vernal season is already six weeks old, it will be admitted that\nno depressing influence is absent from the scene. This fact was keenly\nfelt on a certain 12th of May, upwards of thirty years since, by a lady\nwho stood looking out of one of the windows of the best hotel in the\nancient city of Boston. She had stood there for half an hour--stood\nthere, that is, at intervals; for from time to time she turned back\ninto the room and measured its length with a restless step. In the\nchimney-place was a red-hot fire which emitted a small blue flame; and\nin front of the fire, at a table, sat a young man who was busily plying\na pencil. He had a number of sheets of paper cut into small\nequal squares, and he was apparently covering them with pictorial\ndesigns--strange-looking figures. He worked rapidly and attentively,\nsometimes threw back his head and held out his drawing at arm’s-length,\nand kept up a soft, gay-sounding humming and whistling. The lady brushed\npast him in her walk; her much-trimmed skirts were voluminous. She never\ndropped her eyes upon his work; she only turned them, occasionally, as\nshe passed, to a mirror suspended above the toilet-table on the other\nside of the room. Here she paused a moment, gave a pinch to her waist\nwith her two hands, or raised these members--they were very plump\nand pretty--to the multifold braids of her hair, with a movement half\ncaressing, half corrective. An attentive observer might have fancied\nthat during these periods of desultory self-inspection her face forgot\nits melancholy; but as soon as she neared the window again it began to\nproclaim that she was a very ill-pleased woman. And indeed, in what\nmet her eyes there was little to be pleased with. The window-panes were\nbattered by the sleet; the head-stones in the grave-yard beneath seemed\nto be holding themselves askance to keep it out of their faces. A tall\niron railing protected them from the street, and on the other side of\nthe railing an assemblage of Bostonians were trampling about in the\nliquid snow. Many of them were looking up and down; they appeared to be\nwaiting for something. From time to time a strange vehicle drew near to\nthe place where they stood,--such a vehicle as the lady at the window,\nin spite of a considerable acquaintance with human inventions, had\nnever seen before: a huge, low omnibus, painted in brilliant colors,\nand decorated apparently with jangling bells, attached to a species of\ngroove in the pavement, through which it was dragged, with a great deal\nof rumbling, bouncing and scratching, by a couple of remarkably small\nhorses. When it reached a certain point the people in front of the\ngrave-yard, of whom much the greater number were women, carrying\nsatchels and parcels, projected themselves upon it in a compact body--a\nmovement suggesting the scramble for places in a life-boat at sea--and\nwere engulfed in its large interior. Then the life-boat--or the\nlife-car, as the lady at the window of the hotel vaguely designated\nit--went bumping and jingling away upon its invisible wheels, with the\nhelmsman (the man at the wheel) guiding its course incongruously from\nthe prow. This phenomenon was repeated every three minutes, and the\nsupply of eagerly-moving women in cloaks, bearing reticules and bundles,\nrenewed itself in the most liberal manner. On the other side of the\ngrave-yard was a row of small red brick houses, showing a series of\nhomely, domestic-looking backs; at the end opposite the hotel a tall\nwooden church-spire, painted white, rose high into the vagueness of\nthe snow-flakes. The lady at the window looked at it for some time; for\nreasons of her own she thought it the ugliest thing she had ever seen.\nShe hated it, she despised it; it threw her into a state of irritation\nthat was quite out of proportion to any sensible motive. She had never\nknown herself to care so much about church-spires.\n\nShe was not pretty; but even when it expressed perplexed irritation her\nface was most interesting and agreeable. Neither was she in her\nfirst youth; yet, though slender, with a great deal of extremely\nwell-fashioned roundness of contour--a suggestion both of maturity and\nflexibility--she carried her three and thirty years as a light-wristed\nHebe might have carried a brimming wine-cup. Her complexion was\nfatigued, as the French say; her mouth was large, her lips too full, her\nteeth uneven, her chin rather commonly modeled; she had a thick nose,\nand when she smiled--she was constantly smiling--the lines beside it\nrose too high, toward her eyes. But these eyes were charming: gray\nin color, brilliant, quickly glancing, gently resting, full of\nintelligence. Her forehead was very low--it was her only handsome\nfeature; and she had a great abundance of crisp dark hair, finely\nfrizzled, which was always braided in a manner that suggested some\nSouthern or Eastern, some remotely foreign, woman. She had a large\ncollection of ear-rings, and wore them in alternation; and they seemed\nto give a point to her Oriental or exotic aspect. A compliment had once\nbeen paid her, which, being repeated to her, gave her greater pleasure\nthan anything she had ever heard. “A pretty woman?” someone had said.\n“Why, her features are very bad.” “I don’t know about her features,” a\nvery discerning observer had answered; “but she carries her head like a\npretty woman.” You may imagine whether, after this, she carried her head\nless becomingly.\n\nShe turned away from the window at last, pressing her hands to her eyes.\n“It’s too horrible!” she exclaimed. “I shall go back--I shall go back!”\n And she flung herself into a chair before the fire.\n\n“Wait a little, dear child,” said the young man softly, sketching away\nat his little scraps of paper.\n\nThe lady put out her foot; it was very small, and there was an immense\nrosette on her slipper. She fixed her eyes for a while on this ornament,\nand then she looked at the glowing bed of anthracite coal in the grate.\n“Did you ever see anything so hideous as that fire?” she demanded. “Did\nyou ever see anything so--so _affreux_ as--as everything?” She spoke\nEnglish with perfect purity; but she brought out this French epithet\nin a manner that indicated that she was accustomed to using French\nepithets.\n\n“I think the fire is very pretty,” said the young man, glancing at it\na moment. “Those little blue tongues, dancing on top of the crimson\nembers, are extremely picturesque. They are like a fire in an\nalchemist’s laboratory.”\n\n“You are too good-natured, my dear,” his companion declared.\n\nThe young man held out one of his drawings, with his head on one side.\nHis tongue was gently moving along his under-lip. “Good-natured--yes.\nToo good-natured--no.”\n\n“You are irritating,” said the lady, looking at her slipper.\n\nHe began to retouch his sketch. “I think you mean simply that you are\nirritated.”\n\n“Ah, for that, yes!” said his companion, with a little bitter laugh.\n“It’s the darkest day of my life--and you know what that means.”\n\n“Wait till tomorrow,” rejoined the young man.\n\n“Yes, we have made a great mistake. If there is any doubt about it\ntoday, there certainly will be none tomorrow. _Ce sera clair, au\nmoins!_”\n\nThe young man was silent a few moments, driving his pencil. Then at\nlast, “There are no such things as mistakes,” he affirmed.\n\n“Very true--for those who are not clever enough to perceive them. Not\nto recognize one’s mistakes--that would be happiness in life,” the lady\nwent on, still looking at her pretty foot.\n\n“My dearest sister,” said the young man, always intent upon his drawing,\n“it’s the first time you have told me I am not clever.”\n\n“Well, by your own theory I can’t call it a mistake,” answered his\nsister, pertinently enough.\n\nThe young man gave a clear, fresh laugh. “You, at least, are clever\nenough, dearest sister,” he said.\n\n“I was not so when I proposed this.”\n\n“Was it you who proposed it?” asked her brother.\n\nShe turned her head and gave him a little stare. “Do you desire the\ncredit of it?”\n\n“If you like, I will take the blame,” he said, looking up with a smile.\n\n“Yes,” she rejoined in a moment, “you make no difference in these\nthings. You have no sense of property.”\n\nThe young man gave his joyous laugh again. “If that means I have no\nproperty, you are right!”\n\n“Don’t joke about your poverty,” said his sister. “That is quite as\nvulgar as to boast about it.”\n\n“My poverty! I have just finished a drawing that will bring me fifty\nfrancs!”\n\n_“Voyons,”_ said the lady, putting out her hand.\n\nHe added a touch or two, and then gave her his sketch. She looked at it,\nbut she went on with her idea of a moment before. “If a woman were to\nask you to marry her you would say, ‘Certainly, my dear, with pleasure!’\nAnd you would marry her and be ridiculously happy. Then at the end of\nthree months you would say to her, ‘You know that blissful day when I\nbegged you to be mine!’”\n\nThe young man had risen from the table, stretching his arms a little; he\nwalked to the window. “That is a description of a charming nature,” he\nsaid.\n\n“Oh, yes, you have a charming nature; I regard that as our capital. If\nI had not been convinced of that I should never have taken the risk of\nbringing you to this dreadful country.”\n\n“This comical country, this delightful country!” exclaimed the young\nman, and he broke into the most animated laughter.\n\n“Is it those women scrambling into the omnibus?” asked his companion.\n“What do you suppose is the attraction?”\n\n“I suppose there is a very good-looking man inside,” said the young man.\n\n“In each of them? They come along in hundreds, and the men in this\ncountry don’t seem at all handsome. As for the women--I have never seen\nso many at once since I left the convent.”\n\n“The women are very pretty,” her brother declared, “and the whole affair\nis very amusing. I must make a sketch of it.” And he came back to the\ntable quickly, and picked up his utensils--a small sketching-board,\na sheet of paper, and three or four crayons. He took his place at the\nwindow with these things, and stood there glancing out, plying his\npencil with an air of easy skill. While he worked he wore a\nbrilliant smile. Brilliant is indeed the word at this moment for his\nstrongly-lighted face. He was eight and twenty years old; he had a\nshort, slight, well-made figure. Though he bore a noticeable resemblance\nto his sister, he was a better favored person: fair-haired, clear-faced,\nwitty-looking, with a delicate finish of feature and an expression at\nonce urbane and not at all serious, a warm blue eye, an eyebrow finely\ndrawn and excessively arched--an eyebrow which, if ladies wrote sonnets\nto those of their lovers, might have been made the subject of such a\npiece of verse--and a light moustache that flourished upwards as if\nblown that way by the breath of a constant smile. There was something\nin his physiognomy at once benevolent and picturesque. But, as I have\nhinted, it was not at all serious. The young man’s face was, in this\nrespect, singular; it was not at all serious, and yet it inspired the\nliveliest confidence.\n\n“Be sure you put in plenty of snow,” said his sister. “_Bonté divine_,\nwhat a climate!”\n\n“I shall leave the sketch all white, and I shall put in the little\nfigures in black,” the young man answered, laughing. “And I shall call\nit--what is that line in Keats?--Mid-May’s Eldest Child!”\n\n“I don’t remember,” said the lady, “that mamma ever told me it was like\nthis.”\n\n“Mamma never told you anything disagreeable. And it’s not like\nthis--every day. You will see that tomorrow we shall have a splendid\nday.”\n\n“_Qu’en savez-vous?_ Tomorrow I shall go away.”\n\n“Where shall you go?”\n\n“Anywhere away from here. Back to Silberstadt. I shall write to the\nReigning Prince.”\n\nThe young man turned a little and looked at her, with his crayon poised.\n“My dear Eugenia,” he murmured, “were you so happy at sea?”\n\nEugenia got up; she still held in her hand the drawing her brother had\ngiven her. It was a bold, expressive sketch of a group of miserable\npeople on the deck of a steamer, clinging together and clutching at each\nother, while the vessel lurched downward, at a terrific angle, into\nthe hollow of a wave. It was extremely clever, and full of a sort of\ntragi-comical power. Eugenia dropped her eyes upon it and made a sad\ngrimace. “How can you draw such odious scenes?” she asked. “I should\nlike to throw it into the fire!” And she tossed the paper away. Her\nbrother watched, quietly, to see where it went. It fluttered down to the\nfloor, where he let it lie. She came toward the window, pinching in\nher waist. “Why don’t you reproach me--abuse me?” she asked. “I think\nI should feel better then. Why don’t you tell me that you hate me for\nbringing you here?”\n\n“Because you would not believe it. I adore you, dear sister! I am\ndelighted to be here, and I am charmed with the prospect.”\n\n“I don’t know what had taken possession of me. I had lost my head,”\n Eugenia went on.\n\nThe young man, on his side, went on plying his pencil. “It is evidently\na most curious and interesting country. Here we are, and I mean to enjoy\nit.”\n\nHis companion turned away with an impatient step, but presently came\nback. “High spirits are doubtless an excellent thing,” she said; “but\nyou give one too much of them, and I can’t see that they have done you\nany good.”\n\nThe young man stared, with lifted eyebrows, smiling; he tapped his\nhandsome nose with his pencil. “They have made me happy!”\n\n“That was the least they could do; they have made you nothing else. You\nhave gone through life thanking fortune for such very small favors that\nshe has never put herself to any trouble for you.”\n\n“She must have put herself to a little, I think, to present me with so\nadmirable a sister.”\n\n“Be serious, Felix. You forget that I am your elder.”\n\n“With a sister, then, so elderly!” rejoined Felix, laughing. “I hoped we\nhad left seriousness in Europe.”\n\n“I fancy you will find it here. Remember that you are nearly thirty\nyears old, and that you are nothing but an obscure Bohemian--a penniless\ncorrespondent of an illustrated newspaper.”\n\n“Obscure as much as you please, but not so much of a Bohemian as you\nthink. And not at all penniless! I have a hundred pounds in my pocket.\nI have an engagement to make fifty sketches, and I mean to paint the\nportraits of all our cousins, and of all _their_ cousins, at a hundred\ndollars a head.”\n\n“You are not ambitious,” said Eugenia.\n\n“You are, dear Baroness,” the young man replied.\n\nThe Baroness was silent a moment, looking out at the sleet-darkened\ngrave-yard and the bumping horse-cars. “Yes, I am ambitious,” she said\nat last. “And my ambition has brought me to this dreadful place!” She\nglanced about her--the room had a certain vulgar nudity; the bed and the\nwindow were curtainless--and she gave a little passionate sigh. “Poor\nold ambition!” she exclaimed. Then she flung herself down upon a sofa\nwhich stood near against the wall, and covered her face with her hands.\n\nHer brother went on with his drawing, rapidly and skillfully; after some\nmoments he sat down beside her and showed her his sketch. “Now, don’t\nyou think that’s pretty good for an obscure Bohemian?” he asked. “I have\nknocked off another fifty francs.”\n\nEugenia glanced at the little picture as he laid it on her lap. “Yes,\nit is very clever,” she said. And in a moment she added, “Do you suppose\nour cousins do that?”\n\n“Do what?”\n\n“Get into those things, and look like that.”\n\nFelix meditated awhile. “I really can’t say. It will be interesting to\ndiscover.”\n\n“Oh, the rich people can’t!” said the Baroness.\n\n“Are you very sure they are rich?” asked Felix, lightly.\n\nHis sister slowly turned in her place, looking at him. “Heavenly\npowers!” she murmured. “You have a way of bringing out things!”\n\n“It will certainly be much pleasanter if they are rich,” Felix declared.\n\n“Do you suppose if I had not known they were rich I would ever have\ncome?”\n\nThe young man met his sister’s somewhat peremptory eye with his bright,\ncontented glance. “Yes, it certainly will be pleasanter,” he repeated.\n\n“That is all I expect of them,” said the Baroness. “I don’t count upon\ntheir being clever or friendly--at first--or elegant or interesting. But\nI assure you I insist upon their being rich.”\n\nFelix leaned his head upon the back of the sofa and looked awhile at the\noblong patch of sky to which the window served as frame. The snow was\nceasing; it seemed to him that the sky had begun to brighten. “I count\nupon their being rich,” he said at last, “and powerful, and clever, and\nfriendly, and elegant, and interesting, and generally delightful! _Tu\nvas voir_.” And he bent forward and kissed his sister. “Look there!” he\nwent on. “As a portent, even while I speak, the sky is turning the color\nof gold; the day is going to be splendid.”\n\nAnd indeed, within five minutes the weather had changed. The sun broke\nout through the snow-clouds and jumped into the Baroness’s room. “_Bonté\ndivine_,” exclaimed this lady, “what a climate!”\n\n“We will go out and see the world,” said Felix.\n\nAnd after a while they went out. The air had grown warm as well as\nbrilliant; the sunshine had dried the pavements. They walked about the\nstreets at hazard, looking at the people and the houses, the shops and\nthe vehicles, the blazing blue sky and the muddy crossings, the hurrying\nmen and the slow-strolling maidens, the fresh red bricks and the bright\ngreen trees, the extraordinary mixture of smartness and shabbiness.\nFrom one hour to another the day had grown vernal; even in the bustling\nstreets there was an odor of earth and blossom. Felix was immensely\nentertained. He had called it a comical country, and he went about\nlaughing at everything he saw. You would have said that American\ncivilization expressed itself to his sense in a tissue of capital jokes.\nThe jokes were certainly excellent, and the young man’s merriment was\njoyous and genial. He possessed what is called the pictorial sense;\nand this first glimpse of democratic manners stirred the same sort of\nattention that he would have given to the movements of a lively\nyoung person with a bright complexion. Such attention would have been\ndemonstrative and complimentary; and in the present case Felix might\nhave passed for an undispirited young exile revisiting the haunts of\nhis childhood. He kept looking at the violent blue of the sky, at the\nscintillating air, at the scattered and multiplied patches of color.\n\n“_Comme c’est bariolé_, eh?” he said to his sister in that foreign\ntongue which they both appeared to feel a mysterious prompting\noccasionally to use.\n\n“Yes, it is _bariolé_ indeed,” the Baroness answered. “I don’t like the\ncoloring; it hurts my eyes.”\n\n“It shows how extremes meet,” the young man rejoined. “Instead of coming\nto the West we seem to have gone to the East. The way the sky touches\nthe house-tops is just like Cairo; and the red and blue sign-boards\npatched over the face of everything remind one of Mahometan\ndecorations.”\n\n“The young women are not Mahometan,” said his companion. “They can’t be\nsaid to hide their faces. I never saw anything so bold.”\n\n“Thank Heaven they don’t hide their faces!” cried Felix. “Their faces\nare uncommonly pretty.”\n\n“Yes, their faces are often very pretty,” said the Baroness, who was\na very clever woman. She was too clever a woman not to be capable of\na great deal of just and fine observation. She clung more closely than\nusual to her brother’s arm; she was not exhilarated, as he was; she said\nvery little, but she noted a great many things and made her reflections.\nShe was a little excited; she felt that she had indeed come to a strange\ncountry, to make her fortune. Superficially, she was conscious of a good\ndeal of irritation and displeasure; the Baroness was a very delicate\nand fastidious person. Of old, more than once, she had gone, for\nentertainment’s sake and in brilliant company, to a fair in a provincial\ntown. It seemed to her now that she was at an enormous fair--that the\nentertainment and the _désagréments_ were very much the same. She found\nherself alternately smiling and shrinking; the show was very curious,\nbut it was probable, from moment to moment, that one would be jostled.\nThe Baroness had never seen so many people walking about before; she\nhad never been so mixed up with people she did not know. But little by\nlittle she felt that this fair was a more serious undertaking. She went\nwith her brother into a large public garden, which seemed very pretty,\nbut where she was surprised at seeing no carriages. The afternoon was\ndrawing to a close; the coarse, vivid grass and the slender tree-boles\nwere gilded by the level sunbeams--gilded as with gold that was fresh\nfrom the mine. It was the hour at which ladies should come out for an\nairing and roll past a hedge of pedestrians, holding their parasols\naskance. Here, however, Eugenia observed no indications of this custom,\nthe absence of which was more anomalous as there was a charming avenue\nof remarkably graceful, arching elms in the most convenient contiguity\nto a large, cheerful street, in which, evidently, among the more\nprosperous members of the _bourgeoisie_, a great deal of pedestrianism\nwent forward. Our friends passed out into this well lighted promenade,\nand Felix noticed a great many more pretty girls and called his sister’s\nattention to them. This latter measure, however, was superfluous; for\nthe Baroness had inspected, narrowly, these charming young ladies.\n\n“I feel an intimate conviction that our cousins are like that,” said\nFelix.\n\nThe Baroness hoped so, but this is not what she said. “They are very\npretty,” she said, “but they are mere little girls. Where are the\nwomen--the women of thirty?”\n\n“Of thirty-three, do you mean?” her brother was going to ask; for he\nunderstood often both what she said and what she did not say. But he\nonly exclaimed upon the beauty of the sunset, while the Baroness, who\nhad come to seek her fortune, reflected that it would certainly be well\nfor her if the persons against whom she might need to measure herself\nshould all be mere little girls. The sunset was superb; they stopped\nto look at it; Felix declared that he had never seen such a gorgeous\nmixture of colors. The Baroness also thought it splendid; and she was\nperhaps the more easily pleased from the fact that while she stood there\nshe was conscious of much admiring observation on the part of various\nnice-looking people who passed that way, and to whom a distinguished,\nstrikingly-dressed woman with a foreign air, exclaiming upon the\nbeauties of nature on a Boston street corner in the French tongue,\ncould not be an object of indifference. Eugenia’s spirits rose. She\nsurrendered herself to a certain tranquil gaiety. If she had come to\nseek her fortune, it seemed to her that her fortune would be easy to\nfind. There was a promise of it in the gorgeous purity of the western\nsky; there was an intimation in the mild, unimpertinent gaze of the\npassers of a certain natural facility in things.\n\n“You will not go back to Silberstadt, eh?” asked Felix.\n\n“Not tomorrow,” said the Baroness.\n\n“Nor write to the Reigning Prince?”\n\n“I shall write to him that they evidently know nothing about him over\nhere.”\n\n“He will not believe you,” said the young man. “I advise you to let him\nalone.”\n\nFelix himself continued to be in high good humor. Brought up among\nancient customs and in picturesque cities, he yet found plenty of local\ncolor in the little Puritan metropolis. That evening, after dinner, he\ntold his sister that he should go forth early on the morrow to look up\ntheir cousins.\n\n“You are very impatient,” said Eugenia.\n\n“What can be more natural,” he asked, “after seeing all those pretty\ngirls today? If one’s cousins are of that pattern, the sooner one knows\nthem the better.”\n\n“Perhaps they are not,” said Eugenia. “We ought to have brought some\nletters--to some other people.”\n\n“The other people would not be our kinsfolk.”\n\n“Possibly they would be none the worse for that,” the Baroness replied.\n\nHer brother looked at her with his eyebrows lifted. “That was not what\nyou said when you first proposed to me that we should come out here and\nfraternize with our relatives. You said that it was the prompting of\nnatural affection; and when I suggested some reasons against it you\ndeclared that the _voix du sang_ should go before everything.”\n\n“You remember all that?” asked the Baroness.\n\n“Vividly! I was greatly moved by it.”\n\nShe was walking up and down the room, as she had done in the morning;\nshe stopped in her walk and looked at her brother. She apparently was\ngoing to say something, but she checked herself and resumed her walk.\nThen, in a few moments, she said something different, which had the\neffect of an explanation of the suppression of her earlier thought. “You\nwill never be anything but a child, dear brother.”\n\n“One would suppose that you, madam,” answered Felix, laughing, “were a\nthousand years old.”\n\n“I am--sometimes,” said the Baroness.\n\n“I will go, then, and announce to our cousins the arrival of a\npersonage so extraordinary. They will immediately come and pay you their\nrespects.”\n\nEugenia paced the length of the room again, and then she stopped before\nher brother, laying her hand upon his arm. “They are not to come and see\nme,” she said. “You are not to allow that. That is not the way I shall\nmeet them first.” And in answer to his interrogative glance she went on.\n“You will go and examine, and report. You will come back and tell me\nwho they are and what they are; their number, gender, their respective\nages--all about them. Be sure you observe everything; be ready to\ndescribe to me the locality, the accessories--how shall I say\nit?--the _mise en scène_. Then, at my own time, at my own hour, under\ncircumstances of my own choosing, I will go to them. I will present\nmyself--I will appear before them!” said the Baroness, this time\nphrasing her idea with a certain frankness.\n\n“And what message am I to take to them?” asked Felix, who had a lively\nfaith in the justness of his sister’s arrangements.\n\nShe looked at him a moment--at his expression of agreeable veracity;\nand, with that justness that he admired, she replied, “Say what you\nplease. Tell my story in the way that seems to you most--natural.” And\nshe bent her forehead for him to kiss.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nThe next day was splendid, as Felix had prophesied; if the winter had\nsuddenly leaped into spring, the spring had for the moment as quickly\nleaped into summer. This was an observation made by a young girl who\ncame out of a large square house in the country, and strolled about in\nthe spacious garden which separated it from a muddy road. The flowering\nshrubs and the neatly-disposed plants were basking in the abundant\nlight and warmth; the transparent shade of the great elms--they were\nmagnificent trees--seemed to thicken by the hour; and the intensely\nhabitual stillness offered a submissive medium to the sound of a distant\nchurch-bell. The young girl listened to the church-bell; but she was not\ndressed for church. She was bare-headed; she wore a white muslin waist,\nwith an embroidered border, and the skirt of her dress was of colored\nmuslin. She was a young lady of some two or three and twenty years\nof age, and though a young person of her sex walking bare-headed in\na garden, of a Sunday morning in spring-time, can, in the nature of\nthings, never be a displeasing object, you would not have pronounced\nthis innocent Sabbath-breaker especially pretty. She was tall and pale,\nthin and a little awkward; her hair was fair and perfectly straight; her\neyes were dark, and they had the singularity of seeming at once dull\nand restless--differing herein, as you see, fatally from the ideal “fine\neyes,” which we always imagine to be both brilliant and tranquil. The\ndoors and windows of the large square house were all wide open, to admit\nthe purifying sunshine, which lay in generous patches upon the floor\nof a wide, high, covered piazza adjusted to two sides of the mansion--a\npiazza on which several straw-bottomed rocking-chairs and half a dozen\nof those small cylindrical stools in green and blue porcelain, which\nsuggest an affiliation between the residents and the Eastern trade, were\nsymmetrically disposed. It was an ancient house--ancient in the sense\nof being eighty years old; it was built of wood, painted a clean, clear,\nfaded gray, and adorned along the front, at intervals, with flat wooden\npilasters, painted white. These pilasters appeared to support a kind of\nclassic pediment, which was decorated in the middle by a large triple\nwindow in a boldly carved frame, and in each of its smaller angles by\na glazed circular aperture. A large white door, furnished with a\nhighly-polished brass knocker, presented itself to the rural-looking\nroad, with which it was connected by a spacious pathway, paved with worn\nand cracked, but very clean, bricks. Behind it there were meadows and\norchards, a barn and a pond; and facing it, a short distance along the\nroad, on the opposite side, stood a smaller house, painted white, with\nexternal shutters painted green, a little garden on one hand and an\norchard on the other. All this was shining in the morning air, through\nwhich the simple details of the picture addressed themselves to the eye\nas distinctly as the items of a “sum” in addition.\n\nA second young lady presently came out of the house, across the piazza,\ndescended into the garden and approached the young girl of whom I have\nspoken. This second young lady was also thin and pale; but she was older\nthan the other; she was shorter; she had dark, smooth hair. Her eyes,\nunlike the other’s, were quick and bright; but they were not at all\nrestless. She wore a straw bonnet with white ribbons, and a long, red,\nIndia scarf, which, on the front of her dress, reached to her feet. In\nher hand she carried a little key.\n\n“Gertrude,” she said, “are you very sure you had better not go to\nchurch?”\n\nGertrude looked at her a moment, plucked a small sprig from a\nlilac-bush, smelled it and threw it away. “I am not very sure of\nanything!” she answered.\n\nThe other young lady looked straight past her, at the distant pond,\nwhich lay shining between the long banks of fir trees. Then she said in\na very soft voice, “This is the key of the dining-room closet. I think\nyou had better have it, if anyone should want anything.”\n\n“Who is there to want anything?” Gertrude demanded. “I shall be all\nalone in the house.”\n\n“Someone may come,” said her companion.\n\n“Do you mean Mr. Brand?”\n\n“Yes, Gertrude. He may like a piece of cake.”\n\n“I don’t like men that are always eating cake!” Gertrude declared,\ngiving a pull at the lilac-bush.\n\nHer companion glanced at her, and then looked down on the ground. “I\nthink father expected you would come to church,” she said. “What shall I\nsay to him?”\n\n“Say I have a bad headache.”\n\n“Would that be true?” asked the elder lady, looking straight at the pond\nagain.\n\n“No, Charlotte,” said the younger one simply.\n\nCharlotte transferred her quiet eyes to her companion’s face. “I am\nafraid you are feeling restless.”\n\n“I am feeling as I always feel,” Gertrude replied, in the same tone.\n\nCharlotte turned away; but she stood there a moment. Presently she\nlooked down at the front of her dress. “Doesn’t it seem to you, somehow,\nas if my scarf were too long?” she asked.\n\nGertrude walked half round her, looking at the scarf. “I don’t think you\nwear it right,” she said.\n\n“How should I wear it, dear?”\n\n“I don’t know; differently from that. You should draw it differently\nover your shoulders, round your elbows; you should look differently\nbehind.”\n\n“How should I look?” Charlotte inquired.\n\n“I don’t think I can tell you,” said Gertrude, plucking out the scarf\na little behind. “I could do it myself, but I don’t think I can explain\nit.”\n\nCharlotte, by a movement of her elbows, corrected the laxity that had\ncome from her companion’s touch. “Well, some day you must do it for me.\nIt doesn’t matter now. Indeed, I don’t think it matters,” she added,\n“how one looks behind.”\n\n“I should say it mattered more,” said Gertrude. “Then you don’t know who\nmay be observing you. You are not on your guard. You can’t try to look\npretty.”\n\nCharlotte received this declaration with extreme gravity. “I don’t think\none should ever try to look pretty,” she rejoined, earnestly.\n\nHer companion was silent. Then she said, “Well, perhaps it’s not of much\nuse.”\n\nCharlotte looked at her a little, and then kissed her. “I hope you will\nbe better when we come back.”\n\n“My dear sister, I am very well!” said Gertrude.\n\nCharlotte went down the large brick walk to the garden gate; her\ncompanion strolled slowly toward the house. At the gate Charlotte met a\nyoung man, who was coming in--a tall, fair young man, wearing a high hat\nand a pair of thread gloves. He was handsome, but rather too stout. He\nhad a pleasant smile. “Oh, Mr. Brand!” exclaimed the young lady.\n\n“I came to see whether your sister was not going to church,” said the\nyoung man.\n\n“She says she is not going; but I am very glad you have come. I think if\nyou were to talk to her a little”.... And Charlotte lowered her voice.\n“It seems as if she were restless.”\n\nMr. Brand smiled down on the young lady from his great height. “I shall\nbe very glad to talk to her. For that I should be willing to absent\nmyself from almost any occasion of worship, however attractive.”\n\n“Well, I suppose you know,” said Charlotte, softly, as if positive\nacceptance of this proposition might be dangerous. “But I am afraid I\nshall be late.”\n\n“I hope you will have a pleasant sermon,” said the young man.\n\n“Oh, Mr. Gilman is always pleasant,” Charlotte answered. And she went on\nher way.\n\nMr. Brand went into the garden, where Gertrude, hearing the gate close\nbehind him, turned and looked at him. For a moment she watched him\ncoming; then she turned away. But almost immediately she corrected this\nmovement, and stood still, facing him. He took off his hat and wiped his\nforehead as he approached. Then he put on his hat again and held out his\nhand. His hat being removed, you would have perceived that his forehead\nwas very large and smooth, and his hair abundant but rather colorless.\nHis nose was too large, and his mouth and eyes were too small; but for\nall this he was, as I have said, a young man of striking appearance. The\nexpression of his little clean-colored blue eyes was irresistibly gentle\nand serious; he looked, as the phrase is, as good as gold. The young\ngirl, standing in the garden path, glanced, as he came up, at his thread\ngloves.\n\n“I hoped you were going to church,” he said. “I wanted to walk with\nyou.”\n\n“I am very much obliged to you,” Gertrude answered. “I am not going to\nchurch.”\n\nShe had shaken hands with him; he held her hand a moment. “Have you any\nspecial reason for not going?”\n\n“Yes, Mr. Brand,” said the young girl.\n\n“May I ask what it is?”\n\nShe looked at him smiling; and in her smile, as I have intimated, there\nwas a certain dullness. But mingled with this dullness was something\nsweet and suggestive. “Because the sky is so blue!” she said.\n\nHe looked at the sky, which was magnificent, and then said, smiling too,\n“I have heard of young ladies staying at home for bad weather, but\nnever for good. Your sister, whom I met at the gate, tells me you are\ndepressed,” he added.\n\n“Depressed? I am never depressed.”\n\n“Oh, surely, sometimes,” replied Mr. Brand, as if he thought this a\nregrettable account of one’s self.\n\n“I am never depressed,” Gertrude repeated. “But I am sometimes wicked.\nWhen I am wicked I am in high spirits. I was wicked just now to my\nsister.”\n\n“What did you do to her?”\n\n“I said things that puzzled her--on purpose.”\n\n“Why did you do that, Miss Gertrude?” asked the young man.\n\nShe began to smile again. “Because the sky is so blue!”\n\n“You say things that puzzle _me_,” Mr. Brand declared.\n\n“I always know when I do it,” proceeded Gertrude. “But people puzzle me\nmore, I think. And they don’t seem to know!”\n\n“This is very interesting,” Mr. Brand observed, smiling.\n\n“You told me to tell you about my--my struggles,” the young girl went\non.\n\n“Let us talk about them. I have so many things to say.”\n\nGertrude turned away a moment; and then, turning back, “You had better\ngo to church,” she said.\n\n“You know,” the young man urged, “that I have always one thing to say.”\n\nGertrude looked at him a moment. “Please don’t say it now!”\n\n“We are all alone,” he continued, taking off his hat; “all alone in this\nbeautiful Sunday stillness.”\n\nGertrude looked around her, at the breaking buds, the shining\ndistance, the blue sky to which she had referred as a pretext for her\nirregularities. “That’s the reason,” she said, “why I don’t want you to\nspeak. Do me a favor; go to church.”\n\n“May I speak when I come back?” asked Mr. Brand.\n\n“If you are still disposed,” she answered.\n\n“I don’t know whether you are wicked,” he said, “but you are certainly\npuzzling.”\n\nShe had turned away; she raised her hands to her ears. He looked at her\na moment, and then he slowly walked to church.\n\nShe wandered for a while about the garden, vaguely and without purpose.\nThe church-bell had stopped ringing; the stillness was complete. This\nyoung lady relished highly, on occasions, the sense of being alone--the\nabsence of the whole family and the emptiness of the house. Today,\napparently, the servants had also gone to church; there was never a\nfigure at the open windows; behind the house there was no stout negress\nin a red turban, lowering the bucket into the great shingle-hooded\nwell. And the front door of the big, unguarded home stood open, with\nthe trustfulness of the golden age; or what is more to the purpose, with\nthat of New England’s silvery prime. Gertrude slowly passed through it,\nand went from one of the empty rooms to the other--large, clear-colored\nrooms, with white wainscots, ornamented with thin-legged mahogany\nfurniture, and, on the walls, with old-fashioned engravings, chiefly of\nscriptural subjects, hung very high. This agreeable sense of solitude,\nof having the house to herself, of which I have spoken, always excited\nGertrude’s imagination; she could not have told you why, and neither can\nher humble historian. It always seemed to her that she must do something\nparticular--that she must honor the occasion; and while she roamed\nabout, wondering what she could do, the occasion usually came to an end.\nToday she wondered more than ever. At last she took down a book; there\nwas no library in the house, but there were books in all the rooms. None\nof them were forbidden books, and Gertrude had not stopped at home for\nthe sake of a chance to climb to the inaccessible shelves. She possessed\nherself of a very obvious volume--one of the series of the _Arabian\nNights_--and she brought it out into the portico and sat down with it\nin her lap. There, for a quarter of an hour, she read the history of\nthe loves of the Prince Camaralzaman and the Princess Badoura. At last,\nlooking up, she beheld, as it seemed to her, the Prince Camaralzaman\nstanding before her. A beautiful young man was making her a very low\nbow--a magnificent bow, such as she had never seen before. He appeared\nto have dropped from the clouds; he was wonderfully handsome; he\nsmiled--smiled as if he were smiling on purpose. Extreme surprise, for a\nmoment, kept Gertrude sitting still; then she rose, without even keeping\nher finger in her book. The young man, with his hat in his hand, still\nlooked at her, smiling and smiling. It was very strange.\n\n“Will you kindly tell me,” said the mysterious visitor, at last,\n“whether I have the honor of speaking to Miss Wentworth?”\n\n“My name is Gertrude Wentworth,” murmured the young woman.\n\n“Then--then--I have the honor--the pleasure--of being your cousin.”\n\nThe young man had so much the character of an apparition that this\nannouncement seemed to complete his unreality. “What cousin? Who are\nyou?” said Gertrude.\n\nHe stepped back a few paces and looked up at the house; then glanced\nround him at the garden and the distant view. After this he burst out\nlaughing. “I see it must seem to you very strange,” he said. There was,\nafter all, something substantial in his laughter. Gertrude looked at him\nfrom head to foot. Yes, he was remarkably handsome; but his smile was\nalmost a grimace. “It is very still,” he went on, coming nearer again.\nAnd as she only looked at him, for reply, he added, “Are you all alone?”\n\n“Everyone has gone to church,” said Gertrude.\n\n“I was afraid of that!” the young man exclaimed. “But I hope you are not\nafraid of me.”\n\n“You ought to tell me who you are,” Gertrude answered.\n\n“I am afraid of you!” said the young man. “I had a different plan. I\nexpected the servant would take in my card, and that you would put your\nheads together, before admitting me, and make out my identity.”\n\nGertrude had been wondering with a quick intensity which brought\nits result; and the result seemed an answer--a wondrous, delightful\nanswer--to her vague wish that something would befall her. “I know--I\nknow,” she said. “You come from Europe.”\n\n“We came two days ago. You have heard of us, then--you believe in us?”\n\n“We have known, vaguely,” said Gertrude, “that we had relations in\nFrance.”\n\n“And have you ever wanted to see us?” asked the young man.\n\nGertrude was silent a moment. “I have wanted to see you.”\n\n“I am glad, then, it is you I have found. We wanted to see you, so we\ncame.”\n\n“On purpose?” asked Gertrude.\n\nThe young man looked round him, smiling still. “Well, yes; on purpose.\nDoes that sound as if we should bore you?” he added. “I don’t think we\nshall--I really don’t think we shall. We are rather fond of wandering,\ntoo; and we were glad of a pretext.”\n\n“And you have just arrived?”\n\n“In Boston, two days ago. At the inn I asked for Mr. Wentworth. He must\nbe your father. They found out for me where he lived; they seemed often\nto have heard of him. I determined to come, without ceremony. So, this\nlovely morning, they set my face in the right direction, and told me to\nwalk straight before me, out of town. I came on foot because I wanted\nto see the country. I walked and walked, and here I am! It’s a good many\nmiles.”\n\n“It is seven miles and a half,” said Gertrude, softly. Now that this\nhandsome young man was proving himself a reality she found herself\nvaguely trembling; she was deeply excited. She had never in her life\nspoken to a foreigner, and she had often thought it would be delightful\nto do so. Here was one who had suddenly been engendered by the Sabbath\nstillness for her private use; and such a brilliant, polite, smiling\none! She found time and means to compose herself, however: to remind\nherself that she must exercise a sort of official hospitality. “We are\nvery--very glad to see you,” she said. “Won’t you come into the house?”\n And she moved toward the open door.\n\n“You are not afraid of me, then?” asked the young man again, with his\nlight laugh.\n\nShe wondered a moment, and then, “We are not afraid--here,” she said.\n\n_“Ah, comme vous devez avoir raison!”_ cried the young man, looking all\nround him, appreciatively. It was the first time that Gertrude had heard\nso many words of French spoken. They gave her something of a sensation.\nHer companion followed her, watching, with a certain excitement of his\nown, this tall, interesting-looking girl, dressed in her clear, crisp\nmuslin. He paused in the hall, where there was a broad white staircase\nwith a white balustrade. “What a pleasant house!” he said. “It’s lighter\ninside than it is out.”\n\n“It’s pleasanter here,” said Gertrude, and she led the way into the\nparlor,--a high, clean, rather empty-looking room. Here they stood\nlooking at each other,--the young man smiling more than ever; Gertrude,\nvery serious, trying to smile.\n\n“I don’t believe you know my name,” he said. “I am called Felix Young.\nYour father is my uncle. My mother was his half sister, and older than\nhe.”\n\n“Yes,” said Gertrude, “and she turned Roman Catholic and married in\nEurope.”\n\n“I see you know,” said the young man. “She married and she died. Your\nfather’s family didn’t like her husband. They called him a foreigner;\nbut he was not. My poor father was born in Sicily, but his parents were\nAmerican.”\n\n“In Sicily?” Gertrude murmured.\n\n“It is true,” said Felix Young, “that they had spent their lives in\nEurope. But they were very patriotic. And so are we.”\n\n“And you are Sicilian,” said Gertrude.\n\n“Sicilian, no! Let’s see. I was born at a little place--a dear little\nplace--in France. My sister was born at Vienna.”\n\n“So you are French,” said Gertrude.\n\n“Heaven forbid!” cried the young man. Gertrude’s eyes were fixed upon\nhim almost insistently. He began to laugh again. “I can easily be\nFrench, if that will please you.”\n\n“You are a foreigner of some sort,” said Gertrude.\n\n“Of some sort--yes; I suppose so. But who can say of what sort? I don’t\nthink we have ever had occasion to settle the question. You know\nthere are people like that. About their country, their religion, their\nprofession, they can’t tell.”\n\nGertrude stood there gazing; she had not asked him to sit down. She\nhad never heard of people like that; she wanted to hear. “Where do you\nlive?” she asked.\n\n“They can’t tell that, either!” said Felix. “I am afraid you will\nthink they are little better than vagabonds. I have lived\nanywhere--everywhere. I really think I have lived in every city in\nEurope.” Gertrude gave a little long soft exhalation. It made the young\nman smile at her again; and his smile made her blush a little. To take\nrefuge from blushing she asked him if, after his long walk, he was not\nhungry or thirsty. Her hand was in her pocket; she was fumbling with the\nlittle key that her sister had given her. “Ah, my dear young lady,” he\nsaid, clasping his hands a little, “if you could give me, in charity, a\nglass of wine!”\n\nGertrude gave a smile and a little nod, and went quickly out of the\nroom. Presently she came back with a very large decanter in one hand\nand a plate in the other, on which was placed a big, round cake with\na frosted top. Gertrude, in taking the cake from the closet, had had a\nmoment of acute consciousness that it composed the refection of which\nher sister had thought that Mr. Brand would like to partake. Her kinsman\nfrom across the seas was looking at the pale, high-hung engravings. When\nshe came in he turned and smiled at her, as if they had been old friends\nmeeting after a separation. “You wait upon me yourself?” he asked. “I am\nserved like the gods!” She had waited upon a great many people, but\nnone of them had ever told her that. The observation added a certain\nlightness to the step with which she went to a little table where there\nwere some curious red glasses--glasses covered with little gold sprigs,\nwhich Charlotte used to dust every morning with her own hands. Gertrude\nthought the glasses very handsome, and it was a pleasure to her to know\nthat the wine was good; it was her father’s famous madeira. Felix Young\nthought it excellent; he wondered why he had been told that there was\nno wine in America. She cut him an immense triangle out of the cake, and\nagain she thought of Mr. Brand. Felix sat there, with his glass in\none hand and his huge morsel of cake in the other--eating, drinking,\nsmiling, talking. “I am very hungry,” he said. “I am not at all tired; I\nam never tired. But I am very hungry.”\n\n“You must stay to dinner,” said Gertrude. “At two o’clock. They will all\nhave come back from church; you will see the others.”\n\n“Who are the others?” asked the young man. “Describe them all.”\n\n“You will see for yourself. It is you that must tell me; now, about your\nsister.”\n\n“My sister is the Baroness Münster,” said Felix.\n\nOn hearing that his sister was a Baroness, Gertrude got up and walked\nabout slowly, in front of him. She was silent a moment. She was thinking\nof it. “Why didn’t she come, too?” she asked.\n\n“She did come; she is in Boston, at the hotel.”\n\n“We will go and see her,” said Gertrude, looking at him.\n\n“She begs you will not!” the young man replied. “She sends you her love;\nshe sent me to announce her. She will come and pay her respects to your\nfather.”\n\nGertrude felt herself trembling again. A Baroness Münster, who sent a\nbrilliant young man to “announce” her; who was coming, as the Queen\nof Sheba came to Solomon, to pay her “respects” to quiet Mr.\nWentworth--such a personage presented herself to Gertrude’s vision with\na most effective unexpectedness. For a moment she hardly knew what to\nsay. “When will she come?” she asked at last.\n\n“As soon as you will allow her--tomorrow. She is very impatient,”\n answered Felix, who wished to be agreeable.\n\n“Tomorrow, yes,” said Gertrude. She wished to ask more about her; but\nshe hardly knew what could be predicated of a Baroness Münster. “Is\nshe--is she--married?”\n\nFelix had finished his cake and wine; he got up, fixing upon the\nyoung girl his bright, expressive eyes. “She is married to a German\nprince--Prince Adolf, of Silberstadt-Schreckenstein. He is not the\nreigning prince; he is a younger brother.”\n\nGertrude gazed at her informant; her lips were slightly parted. “Is she\na--a _Princess_?” she asked at last.\n\n“Oh, no,” said the young man; “her position is rather a singular one.\nIt’s a morganatic marriage.”\n\n“Morganatic?” These were new names and new words to poor Gertrude.\n\n“That’s what they call a marriage, you know, contracted between a\nscion of a ruling house and--and a common mortal. They made Eugenia a\nBaroness, poor woman; but that was all they could do. Now they want to\ndissolve the marriage. Prince Adolf, between ourselves, is a ninny; but\nhis brother, who is a clever man, has plans for him. Eugenia, naturally\nenough, makes difficulties; not, however, that I think she cares\nmuch--she’s a very clever woman; I’m sure you’ll like her--but she wants\nto bother them. Just now everything is _en l’air_.”\n\nThe cheerful, off-hand tone in which her visitor related this darkly\nromantic tale seemed to Gertrude very strange; but it seemed also to\nconvey a certain flattery to herself, a recognition of her wisdom and\ndignity. She felt a dozen impressions stirring within her, and presently\nthe one that was uppermost found words. “They want to dissolve her\nmarriage?” she asked.\n\n“So it appears.”\n\n“And against her will?”\n\n“Against her right.”\n\n“She must be very unhappy!” said Gertrude.\n\nHer visitor looked at her, smiling; he raised his hand to the back of\nhis head and held it there a moment. “So she says,” he answered. “That’s\nher story. She told me to tell it you.”\n\n“Tell me more,” said Gertrude.\n\n“No, I will leave that to her; she does it better.”\n\nGertrude gave her little excited sigh again. “Well, if she is unhappy,”\n she said, “I am glad she has come to us.”\n\nShe had been so interested that she failed to notice the sound of a\nfootstep in the portico; and yet it was a footstep that she always\nrecognized. She heard it in the hall, and then she looked out of the\nwindow. They were all coming back from church--her father, her sister\nand brother, and their cousins, who always came to dinner on Sunday.\nMr. Brand had come in first; he was in advance of the others, because,\napparently, he was still disposed to say what she had not wished him to\nsay an hour before. He came into the parlor, looking for Gertrude. He\nhad two little books in his hand. On seeing Gertrude’s companion he\nslowly stopped, looking at him.\n\n“Is this a cousin?” asked Felix.\n\nThen Gertrude saw that she must introduce him; but her ears, and, by\nsympathy, her lips, were full of all that he had been telling her. “This\nis the Prince,” she said, “the Prince of Silberstadt-Schreckenstein!”\n\nFelix burst out laughing, and Mr. Brand stood staring, while the others,\nwho had passed into the house, appeared behind him in the open doorway.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nThat evening at dinner Felix Young gave his sister, the Baroness\nMünster, an account of his impressions. She saw that he had come back in\nthe highest possible spirits; but this fact, to her own mind, was not a\nreason for rejoicing. She had but a limited confidence in her brother’s\njudgment; his capacity for taking rose-colored views was such as to\nvulgarize one of the prettiest of tints. Still, she supposed he could\nbe trusted to give her the mere facts; and she invited him with some\neagerness to communicate them. “I suppose, at least, they didn’t turn\nyou out from the door;” she said. “You have been away some ten hours.”\n\n“Turn me from the door!” Felix exclaimed. “They took me to their hearts;\nthey killed the fatted calf.”\n\n“I know what you want to say: they are a collection of angels.”\n\n“Exactly,” said Felix. “They are a collection of angels--simply.”\n\n“_C’est bien vague_,” remarked the Baroness. “What are they like?”\n\n“Like nothing you ever saw.”\n\n“I am sure I am much obliged; but that is hardly more definite.\nSeriously, they were glad to see you?”\n\n“Enchanted. It has been the proudest day of my life. Never, never have I\nbeen so lionized! I assure you, I was cock of the walk. My dear sister,”\n said the young man, “_nous n’avons qu’à nous tenir_; we shall be great\nswells!”\n\nMadame Münster looked at him, and her eye exhibited a slight responsive\nspark. She touched her lips to a glass of wine, and then she said,\n“Describe them. Give me a picture.”\n\nFelix drained his own glass. “Well, it’s in the country, among the\nmeadows and woods; a wild sort of place, and yet not far from here.\nOnly, such a road, my dear! Imagine one of the Alpine glaciers\nreproduced in mud. But you will not spend much time on it, for they want\nyou to come and stay, once for all.”\n\n“Ah,” said the Baroness, “they want me to come and stay, once for all?\n_Bon_.”\n\n“It’s intensely rural, tremendously natural; and all overhung with\nthis strange white light, this far-away blue sky. There’s a big wooden\nhouse--a kind of three-story bungalow; it looks like a magnified\nNuremberg toy. There was a gentleman there that made a speech to me\nabout it and called it a ‘venerable mansion;’ but it looks as if it had\nbeen built last night.”\n\n“Is it handsome--is it elegant?” asked the Baroness.\n\nFelix looked at her a moment, smiling. “It’s very clean! No splendors,\nno gilding, no troops of servants; rather straight-backed chairs. But\nyou might eat off the floors, and you can sit down on the stairs.”\n\n“That must be a privilege. And the inhabitants are straight-backed too,\nof course.”\n\n“My dear sister,” said Felix, “the inhabitants are charming.”\n\n“In what style?”\n\n“In a style of their own. How shall I describe it? It’s primitive; it’s\npatriarchal; it’s the _ton_ of the golden age.”\n\n“And have they nothing golden but their _ton_? Are there no symptoms of\nwealth?”\n\n“I should say there was wealth without symptoms. A plain, homely way of\nlife: nothing for show, and very little for--what shall I call it?--for\nthe senses; but a great _aisance_, and a lot of money, out of sight,\nthat comes forward very quietly for subscriptions to institutions,\nfor repairing tenements, for paying doctor’s bills; perhaps even for\nportioning daughters.”\n\n“And the daughters?” Madame Münster demanded. “How many are there?”\n\n“There are two, Charlotte and Gertrude.”\n\n“Are they pretty?”\n\n“One of them,” said Felix.\n\n“Which is that?”\n\nThe young man was silent, looking at his sister. “Charlotte,” he said at\nlast.\n\nShe looked at him in return. “I see. You are in love with Gertrude. They\nmust be Puritans to their finger-tips; anything but gay!”\n\n“No, they are not gay,” Felix admitted. “They are sober; they are even\nsevere. They are of a pensive cast; they take things hard. I think there\nis something the matter with them; they have some melancholy memory\nor some depressing expectation. It’s not the epicurean temperament. My\nuncle, Mr. Wentworth, is a tremendously high-toned old fellow; he looks\nas if he were undergoing martyrdom, not by fire, but by freezing. But we\nshall cheer them up; we shall do them good. They will take a good deal\nof stirring up; but they are wonderfully kind and gentle. And they are\nappreciative. They think one clever; they think one remarkable!”\n\n“That is very fine, so far as it goes,” said the Baroness. “But are we\nto be shut up to these three people, Mr. Wentworth and the two young\nwomen--what did you say their names were--Deborah and Hephzibah?”\n\n“Oh, no; there is another little girl, a cousin of theirs, a very pretty\ncreature; a thorough little American. And then there is the son of the\nhouse.”\n\n“Good!” said the Baroness. “We are coming to the gentlemen. What of the\nson of the house?”\n\n“I am afraid he gets tipsy.”\n\n“He, then, has the epicurean temperament! How old is he?”\n\n“He is a boy of twenty; a pretty young fellow, but I am afraid he has\nvulgar tastes. And then there is Mr. Brand--a very tall young man, a\nsort of lay-priest. They seem to think a good deal of him, but I don’t\nexactly make him out.”\n\n“And is there nothing,” asked the Baroness, “between these\nextremes--this mysterious ecclesiastic and that intemperate youth?”\n\n“Oh, yes, there is Mr. Acton. I think,” said the young man, with a nod\nat his sister, “that you will like Mr. Acton.”\n\n“Remember that I am very fastidious,” said the Baroness. “Has he very\ngood manners?”\n\n“He will have them with you. He is a man of the world; he has been to\nChina.”\n\nMadame Münster gave a little laugh. “A man of the Chinese world! He must\nbe very interesting.”\n\n“I have an idea that he brought home a fortune,” said Felix.\n\n“That is always interesting. Is he young, good-looking, clever?”\n\n“He is less than forty; he has a baldish head; he says witty things. I\nrather think,” added the young man, “that he will admire the Baroness\nMünster.”\n\n“It is very possible,” said this lady. Her brother never knew how she\nwould take things; but shortly afterwards she declared that he had made\na very pretty description and that on the morrow she would go and see\nfor herself.\n\nThey mounted, accordingly, into a great barouche--a vehicle as to which\nthe Baroness found nothing to criticise but the price that was asked\nfor it and the fact that the coachman wore a straw hat. (At Silberstadt\nMadame Münster had had liveries of yellow and crimson.) They drove\ninto the country, and the Baroness, leaning far back and swaying her\nlace-fringed parasol, looked to right and to left and surveyed the\nway-side objects. After a while she pronounced them _affreux_.\nHer brother remarked that it was apparently a country in which the\nforeground was inferior to the _plans reculés_; and the Baroness\nrejoined that the landscape seemed to be all foreground. Felix had fixed\nwith his new friends the hour at which he should bring his sister; it\nwas four o’clock in the afternoon. The large, clean-faced house wore,\nto his eyes, as the barouche drove up to it, a very friendly aspect; the\nhigh, slender elms made lengthening shadows in front of it. The Baroness\ndescended; her American kinsfolk were stationed in the portico. Felix\nwaved his hat to them, and a tall, lean gentleman, with a high forehead\nand a clean shaven face, came forward toward the garden gate. Charlotte\nWentworth walked at his side. Gertrude came behind, more slowly. Both of\nthese young ladies wore rustling silk dresses. Felix ushered his sister\ninto the gate. “Be very gracious,” he said to her. But he saw the\nadmonition was superfluous. Eugenia was prepared to be gracious as\nonly Eugenia could be. Felix knew no keener pleasure than to be able to\nadmire his sister unrestrictedly; for if the opportunity was frequent,\nit was not inveterate. When she desired to please she was to him, as to\neveryone else, the most charming woman in the world. Then he forgot that\nshe was ever anything else; that she was sometimes hard and perverse;\nthat he was occasionally afraid of her. Now, as she took his arm to pass\ninto the garden, he felt that she desired, that she proposed, to please,\nand this situation made him very happy. Eugenia would please.\n\nThe tall gentleman came to meet her, looking very rigid and grave. But\nit was a rigidity that had no illiberal meaning. Mr. Wentworth’s manner\nwas pregnant, on the contrary, with a sense of grand responsibility, of\nthe solemnity of the occasion, of its being difficult to show sufficient\ndeference to a lady at once so distinguished and so unhappy. Felix\nhad observed on the day before his characteristic pallor; and now he\nperceived that there was something almost cadaverous in his uncle’s\nhigh-featured white face. But so clever were this young man’s quick\nsympathies and perceptions that he already learned that in these\nsemi-mortuary manifestations there was no cause for alarm. His light\nimagination had gained a glimpse of Mr. Wentworth’s spiritual mechanism,\nand taught him that, the old man being infinitely conscientious, the\nspecial operation of conscience within him announced itself by several\nof the indications of physical faintness.\n\nThe Baroness took her uncle’s hand, and stood looking at him with her\nugly face and her beautiful smile. “Have I done right to come?” she\nasked.\n\n“Very right, very right,” said Mr. Wentworth, solemnly. He had arranged\nin his mind a little speech; but now it quite faded away. He felt almost\nfrightened. He had never been looked at in just that way--with just that\nfixed, intense smile--by any woman; and it perplexed and weighed upon\nhim, now, that the woman who was smiling so and who had instantly given\nhim a vivid sense of her possessing other unprecedented attributes, was\nhis own niece, the child of his own father’s daughter. The idea that his\nniece should be a German Baroness, married “morganatically” to a Prince,\nhad already given him much to think about. Was it right, was it just,\nwas it acceptable? He always slept badly, and the night before he had\nlain awake much more even than usual, asking himself these questions.\nThe strange word “morganatic” was constantly in his ears; it reminded\nhim of a certain Mrs. Morgan whom he had once known and who had been a\nbold, unpleasant woman. He had a feeling that it was his duty, so long\nas the Baroness looked at him, smiling in that way, to meet her glance\nwith his own scrupulously adjusted, consciously frigid organs of vision;\nbut on this occasion he failed to perform his duty to the last. He\nlooked away toward his daughters. “We are very glad to see you,” he had\nsaid. “Allow me to introduce my daughters--Miss Charlotte Wentworth,\nMiss Gertrude Wentworth.”\n\nThe Baroness thought she had never seen people less demonstrative.\nBut Charlotte kissed her and took her hand, looking at her sweetly and\nsolemnly. Gertrude seemed to her almost funereal, though Gertrude\nmight have found a source of gaiety in the fact that Felix, with his\nmagnificent smile, had been talking to her; he had greeted her as a\nvery old friend. When she kissed the Baroness she had tears in her eyes.\nMadame Münster took each of these young women by the hand, and looked at\nthem all over. Charlotte thought her very strange-looking and singularly\ndressed; she could not have said whether it was well or ill. She was\nglad, at any rate, that they had put on their silk gowns--especially\nGertrude. “My cousins are very pretty,” said the Baroness, turning her\neyes from one to the other. “Your daughters are very handsome, sir.”\n\nCharlotte blushed quickly; she had never yet heard her personal\nappearance alluded to in a loud, expressive voice. Gertrude looked\naway--not at Felix; she was extremely pleased. It was not the compliment\nthat pleased her; she did not believe it; she thought herself very\nplain. She could hardly have told you the source of her satisfaction;\nit came from something in the way the Baroness spoke, and it was not\ndiminished--it was rather deepened, oddly enough--by the young girl’s\ndisbelief. Mr. Wentworth was silent; and then he asked, formally, “Won’t\nyou come into the house?”\n\n“These are not all; you have some other children,” said the Baroness.\n\n“I have a son,” Mr. Wentworth answered.\n\n“And why doesn’t he come to meet me?” Eugenia cried. “I am afraid he is\nnot so charming as his sisters.”\n\n“I don’t know; I will see about it,” the old man declared.\n\n“He is rather afraid of ladies,” Charlotte said, softly.\n\n“He is very handsome,” said Gertrude, as loud as she could.\n\n“We will go in and find him. We will draw him out of his _cachette_.”\n And the Baroness took Mr. Wentworth’s arm, who was not aware that he had\noffered it to her, and who, as they walked toward the house, wondered\nwhether he ought to have offered it and whether it was proper for her to\ntake it if it had not been offered. “I want to know you well,” said the\nBaroness, interrupting these meditations, “and I want you to know me.”\n\n“It seems natural that we should know each other,” Mr. Wentworth\nrejoined. “We are near relatives.”\n\n“Ah, there comes a moment in life when one reverts, irresistibly, to\none’s natural ties--to one’s natural affections. You must have found\nthat!” said Eugenia.\n\nMr. Wentworth had been told the day before by Felix that Eugenia was\nvery clever, very brilliant, and the information had held him in some\nsuspense. This was the cleverness, he supposed; the brilliancy was\nbeginning. “Yes, the natural affections are very strong,” he murmured.\n\n“In some people,” the Baroness declared. “Not in all.” Charlotte was\nwalking beside her; she took hold of her hand again, smiling always.\n“And you, _cousine_, where did you get that enchanting complexion?”\n she went on; “such lilies and roses?” The roses in poor Charlotte’s\ncountenance began speedily to predominate over the lilies, and she\nquickened her step and reached the portico. “This is the country\nof complexions,” the Baroness continued, addressing herself to Mr.\nWentworth. “I am convinced they are more delicate. There are very good\nones in England--in Holland; but they are very apt to be coarse. There\nis too much red.”\n\n“I think you will find,” said Mr. Wentworth, “that this country is\nsuperior in many respects to those you mention. I have been to England\nand Holland.”\n\n“Ah, you have been to Europe?” cried the Baroness. “Why didn’t you come\nand see me? But it’s better, after all, this way,” she said. They were\nentering the house; she paused and looked round her. “I see you have\narranged your house--your beautiful house--in the--in the Dutch taste!”\n\n“The house is very old,” remarked Mr. Wentworth. “General Washington\nonce spent a week here.”\n\n“Oh, I have heard of Washington,” cried the Baroness. “My father used to\ntell me of him.”\n\nMr. Wentworth was silent a moment, and then, “I found he was very well\nknown in Europe,” he said.\n\nFelix had lingered in the garden with Gertrude; he was standing before\nher and smiling, as he had done the day before. What had happened the\nday before seemed to her a kind of dream. He had been there and he had\nchanged everything; the others had seen him, they had talked with him;\nbut that he should come again, that he should be part of the future,\npart of her small, familiar, much-meditating life--this needed, afresh,\nthe evidence of her senses. The evidence had come to her senses now;\nand her senses seemed to rejoice in it. “What do you think of Eugenia?”\n Felix asked. “Isn’t she charming?”\n\n“She is very brilliant,” said Gertrude. “But I can’t tell yet. She seems\nto me like a singer singing an air. You can’t tell till the song is\ndone.”\n\n“Ah, the song will never be done!” exclaimed the young man, laughing.\n“Don’t you think her handsome?”\n\nGertrude had been disappointed in the beauty of the Baroness Münster;\nshe had expected her, for mysterious reasons, to resemble a very pretty\nportrait of the Empress Josephine, of which there hung an engraving\nin one of the parlors, and which the younger Miss Wentworth had always\ngreatly admired. But the Baroness was not at all like that--not at all.\nThough different, however, she was very wonderful, and Gertrude felt\nherself most suggestively corrected. It was strange, nevertheless, that\nFelix should speak in that positive way about his sister’s beauty. “I\nthink I _shall_ think her handsome,” Gertrude said. “It must be very\ninteresting to know her. I don’t feel as if I ever could.”\n\n“Ah, you will know her well; you will become great friends,” Felix\ndeclared, as if this were the easiest thing in the world.\n\n“She is very graceful,” said Gertrude, looking after the Baroness,\nsuspended to her father’s arm. It was a pleasure to her to say that\nanyone was graceful.\n\nFelix had been looking about him. “And your little cousin, of\nyesterday,” he said, “who was so wonderfully pretty--what has become of\nher?”\n\n“She is in the parlor,” Gertrude answered. “Yes, she is very pretty.”\n She felt as if it were her duty to take him straight into the house,\nto where he might be near her cousin. But after hesitating a moment she\nlingered still. “I didn’t believe you would come back,” she said.\n\n“Not come back!” cried Felix, laughing. “You didn’t know, then, the\nimpression made upon this susceptible heart of mine.”\n\nShe wondered whether he meant the impression her cousin Lizzie had made.\n“Well,” she said, “I didn’t think we should ever see you again.”\n\n“And pray what did you think would become of me?”\n\n“I don’t know. I thought you would melt away.”\n\n“That’s a compliment to my solidity! I melt very often,” said Felix,\n“but there is always something left of me.”\n\n“I came and waited for you by the door, because the others did,”\n Gertrude went on. “But if you had never appeared I should not have been\nsurprised.”\n\n“I hope,” declared Felix, looking at her, “that you would have been\ndisappointed.”\n\nShe looked at him a little, and shook her head. “No--no!”\n\n_“Ah, par exemple!”_ cried the young man. “You deserve that I should\nnever leave you.”\n\nGoing into the parlor they found Mr. Wentworth performing introductions.\nA young man was standing before the Baroness, blushing a good deal,\nlaughing a little, and shifting his weight from one foot to the other--a\nslim, mild-faced young man, with neatly-arranged features, like those\nof Mr. Wentworth. Two other gentlemen, behind him, had risen from their\nseats, and a little apart, near one of the windows, stood a remarkably\npretty young girl. The young girl was knitting a stocking; but, while\nher fingers quickly moved, she looked with wide, brilliant eyes at the\nBaroness.\n\n“And what is your son’s name?” said Eugenia, smiling at the young man.\n\n“My name is Clifford Wentworth, ma’am,” he said in a tremulous voice.\n\n“Why didn’t you come out to meet me, Mr. Clifford Wentworth?” the\nBaroness demanded, with her beautiful smile.\n\n“I didn’t think you would want me,” said the young man, slowly sidling\nabout.\n\n“One always wants a _beau cousin_,--if one has one! But if you are\nvery nice to me in future I won’t remember it against you.” And Madame\nMünster transferred her smile to the other persons present. It rested\nfirst upon the candid countenance and long-skirted figure of Mr. Brand,\nwhose eyes were intently fixed upon Mr. Wentworth, as if to beg him not\nto prolong an anomalous situation. Mr. Wentworth pronounced his name.\nEugenia gave him a very charming glance, and then looked at the other\ngentleman.\n\nThis latter personage was a man of rather less than the usual stature\nand the usual weight, with a quick, observant, agreeable dark eye, a\nsmall quantity of thin dark hair, and a small moustache. He had been\nstanding with his hands in his pockets; and when Eugenia looked at him\nhe took them out. But he did not, like Mr. Brand, look evasively and\nurgently at their host. He met Eugenia’s eyes; he appeared to appreciate\nthe privilege of meeting them. Madame Münster instantly felt that he\nwas, intrinsically, the most important person present. She was not\nunconscious that this impression was in some degree manifested in the\nlittle sympathetic nod with which she acknowledged Mr. Wentworth’s\nannouncement, “My cousin, Mr. Acton!”\n\n“Your cousin--not mine?” said the Baroness.\n\n“It only depends upon you,” Mr. Acton declared, laughing.\n\nThe Baroness looked at him a moment, and noticed that he had very white\nteeth. “Let it depend upon your behavior,” she said. “I think I\nhad better wait. I have cousins enough. Unless I can also claim\nrelationship,” she added, “with that charming young lady,” and she\npointed to the young girl at the window.\n\n“That’s my sister,” said Mr. Acton. And Gertrude Wentworth put her arm\nround the young girl and led her forward. It was not, apparently, that\nshe needed much leading. She came toward the Baroness with a light,\nquick step, and with perfect self-possession, rolling her stocking\nround its needles. She had dark blue eyes and dark brown hair; she was\nwonderfully pretty.\n\nEugenia kissed her, as she had kissed the other young women, and then\nheld her off a little, looking at her. “Now this is quite another\n_type_,” she said; she pronounced the word in the French manner. “This\nis a different outline, my uncle, a different character, from that of\nyour own daughters. This, Felix,” she went on, “is very much more what\nwe have always thought of as the American type.”\n\nThe young girl, during this exposition, was smiling askance at everyone\nin turn, and at Felix out of turn. “I find only one type here!” cried\nFelix, laughing. “The type adorable!”\n\nThis sally was received in perfect silence, but Felix, who learned\nall things quickly, had already learned that the silences frequently\nobserved among his new acquaintances were not necessarily restrictive\nor resentful. It was, as one might say, the silence of expectation,\nof modesty. They were all standing round his sister, as if they were\nexpecting her to acquit herself of the exhibition of some peculiar\nfaculty, some brilliant talent. Their attitude seemed to imply that she\nwas a kind of conversational mountebank, attired, intellectually, in\ngauze and spangles. This attitude gave a certain ironical force to\nMadame Münster’s next words. “Now this is your circle,” she said to her\nuncle. “This is your _salon_. These are your regular _habitués_, eh? I\nam so glad to see you all together.”\n\n“Oh,” said Mr. Wentworth, “they are always dropping in and out. You must\ndo the same.”\n\n“Father,” interposed Charlotte Wentworth, “they must do something more.”\n And she turned her sweet, serious face, that seemed at once timid and\nplacid, upon their interesting visitor. “What is your name?” she asked.\n\n“Eugenia-Camilla-Dolores,” said the Baroness, smiling. “But you needn’t\nsay all that.”\n\n“I will say Eugenia, if you will let me. You must come and stay with\nus.”\n\nThe Baroness laid her hand upon Charlotte’s arm very tenderly; but she\nreserved herself. She was wondering whether it would be possible to\n“stay” with these people. “It would be very charming--very charming,”\n she said; and her eyes wandered over the company, over the room. She\nwished to gain time before committing herself. Her glance fell upon\nyoung Mr. Brand, who stood there, with his arms folded and his hand\non his chin, looking at her. “The gentleman, I suppose, is a sort of\necclesiastic,” she said to Mr. Wentworth, lowering her voice a little.\n\n“He is a minister,” answered Mr. Wentworth.\n\n“A Protestant?” asked Eugenia.\n\n“I am a Unitarian, madam,” replied Mr. Brand, impressively.\n\n“Ah, I see,” said Eugenia. “Something new.” She had never heard of this\nform of worship.\n\nMr. Acton began to laugh, and Gertrude looked anxiously at Mr. Brand.\n\n“You have come very far,” said Mr. Wentworth.\n\n“Very far--very far,” the Baroness replied, with a graceful shake of her\nhead--a shake that might have meant many different things.\n\n“That’s a reason why you ought to settle down with us,” said Mr.\nWentworth, with that dryness of utterance which, as Eugenia was too\nintelligent not to feel, took nothing from the delicacy of his meaning.\n\nShe looked at him, and for an instant, in his cold, still face, she\nseemed to see a far-away likeness to the vaguely remembered image of her\nmother. Eugenia was a woman of sudden emotions, and now, unexpectedly,\nshe felt one rising in her heart. She kept looking round the circle; she\nknew that there was admiration in all the eyes that were fixed upon her.\nShe smiled at them all.\n\n“I came to look--to try--to ask,” she said. “It seems to me I have done\nwell. I am very tired; I want to rest.” There were tears in her eyes.\nThe luminous interior, the gentle, tranquil people, the simple, serious\nlife--the sense of these things pressed upon her with an overmastering\nforce, and she felt herself yielding to one of the most genuine emotions\nshe had ever known. “I should like to stay here,” she said. “Pray take\nme in.”\n\nThough she was smiling, there were tears in her voice as well as in her\neyes. “My dear niece,” said Mr. Wentworth, softly. And Charlotte put\nout her arms and drew the Baroness toward her; while Robert Acton turned\naway, with his hands stealing into his pockets.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nA few days after the Baroness Münster had presented herself to her\nAmerican kinsfolk she came, with her brother, and took up her abode in\nthat small white house adjacent to Mr. Wentworth’s own dwelling of which\nmention has already been made. It was on going with his daughters to\nreturn her visit that Mr. Wentworth placed this comfortable cottage at\nher service; the offer being the result of a domestic colloquy, diffused\nthrough the ensuing twenty-four hours, in the course of which the\ntwo foreign visitors were discussed and analyzed with a great deal of\nearnestness and subtlety. The discussion went forward, as I say, in the\nfamily circle; but that circle on the evening following Madame Münster’s\nreturn to town, as on many other occasions, included Robert Acton and\nhis pretty sister. If you had been present, it would probably not have\nseemed to you that the advent of these brilliant strangers was treated\nas an exhilarating occurrence, a pleasure the more in this tranquil\nhousehold, a prospective source of entertainment. This was not Mr.\nWentworth’s way of treating any human occurrence. The sudden irruption\ninto the well-ordered consciousness of the Wentworths of an element not\nallowed for in its scheme of usual obligations required a readjustment\nof that sense of responsibility which constituted its principal\nfurniture. To consider an event, crudely and baldly, in the light of\nthe pleasure it might bring them was an intellectual exercise with which\nFelix Young’s American cousins were almost wholly unacquainted, and\nwhich they scarcely supposed to be largely pursued in any section of\nhuman society. The arrival of Felix and his sister was a satisfaction,\nbut it was a singularly joyless and inelastic satisfaction. It was an\nextension of duty, of the exercise of the more recondite virtues; but\nneither Mr. Wentworth, nor Charlotte, nor Mr. Brand, who, among these\nexcellent people, was a great promoter of reflection and aspiration,\nfrankly adverted to it as an extension of enjoyment. This function was\nultimately assumed by Gertrude Wentworth, who was a peculiar girl, but\nthe full compass of whose peculiarities had not been exhibited before\nthey very ingeniously found their pretext in the presence of these\npossibly too agreeable foreigners. Gertrude, however, had to struggle\nwith a great accumulation of obstructions, both of the subjective, as\nthe metaphysicians say, and of the objective, order; and indeed it is\nno small part of the purpose of this little history to set forth her\nstruggle. What seemed paramount in this abrupt enlargement of Mr.\nWentworth’s sympathies and those of his daughters was an extension of\nthe field of possible mistakes; and the doctrine, as it may almost\nbe called, of the oppressive gravity of mistakes was one of the most\ncherished traditions of the Wentworth family.\n\n“I don’t believe she wants to come and stay in this house,” said\nGertrude; Madame Münster, from this time forward, receiving no other\ndesignation than the personal pronoun. Charlotte and Gertrude acquired\nconsiderable facility in addressing her, directly, as “Eugenia;” but in\nspeaking of her to each other they rarely called her anything but “she.”\n\n“Doesn’t she think it good enough for her?” cried little Lizzie\nActon, who was always asking unpractical questions that required, in\nstrictness, no answer, and to which indeed she expected no other\nanswer than such as she herself invariably furnished in a small,\ninnocently-satirical laugh.\n\n“She certainly expressed a willingness to come,” said Mr. Wentworth.\n\n“That was only politeness,” Gertrude rejoined.\n\n“Yes, she is very polite--very polite,” said Mr. Wentworth.\n\n“She is too polite,” his son declared, in a softly growling tone which\nwas habitual to him, but which was an indication of nothing worse than a\nvaguely humorous intention. “It is very embarrassing.”\n\n“That is more than can be said of you, sir,” said Lizzie Acton, with her\nlittle laugh.\n\n“Well, I don’t mean to encourage her,” Clifford went on.\n\n“I’m sure I don’t care if you do!” cried Lizzie.\n\n“She will not think of you, Clifford,” said Gertrude, gravely.\n\n“I hope not!” Clifford exclaimed.\n\n“She will think of Robert,” Gertrude continued, in the same tone.\n\nRobert Acton began to blush; but there was no occasion for it, for\neveryone was looking at Gertrude--everyone, at least, save Lizzie, who,\nwith her pretty head on one side, contemplated her brother.\n\n“Why do you attribute motives, Gertrude?” asked Mr. Wentworth.\n\n“I don’t attribute motives, father,” said Gertrude. “I only say she will\nthink of Robert; and she will!”\n\n“Gertrude judges by herself!” Acton exclaimed, laughing. “Don’t you,\nGertrude? Of course the Baroness will think of me. She will think of me\nfrom morning till night.”\n\n“She will be very comfortable here,” said Charlotte, with something of\na housewife’s pride. “She can have the large northeast room. And the\nFrench bedstead,” Charlotte added, with a constant sense of the lady’s\nforeignness.\n\n“She will not like it,” said Gertrude; “not even if you pin little\ntidies all over the chairs.”\n\n“Why not, dear?” asked Charlotte, perceiving a touch of irony here, but\nnot resenting it.\n\nGertrude had left her chair; she was walking about the room; her stiff\nsilk dress, which she had put on in honor of the Baroness, made a sound\nupon the carpet. “I don’t know,” she replied. “She will want something\nmore--more private.”\n\n“If she wants to be private she can stay in her room,” Lizzie Acton\nremarked.\n\nGertrude paused in her walk, looking at her. “That would not be\npleasant,” she answered. “She wants privacy and pleasure together.”\n\nRobert Acton began to laugh again. “My dear cousin, what a picture!”\n\nCharlotte had fixed her serious eyes upon her sister; she wondered\nwhence she had suddenly derived these strange notions. Mr. Wentworth\nalso observed his younger daughter.\n\n“I don’t know what her manner of life may have been,” he said; “but she\ncertainly never can have enjoyed a more refined and salubrious home.”\n\nGertrude stood there looking at them all. “She is the wife of a Prince,”\n she said.\n\n“We are all princes here,” said Mr. Wentworth; “and I don’t know of any\npalace in this neighborhood that is to let.”\n\n“Cousin William,” Robert Acton interposed, “do you want to do something\nhandsome? Make them a present, for three months, of the little house\nover the way.”\n\n“You are very generous with other people’s things!” cried his sister.\n\n“Robert is very generous with his own things,” Mr. Wentworth observed\ndispassionately, and looking, in cold meditation, at his kinsman.\n\n“Gertrude,” Lizzie went on, “I had an idea you were so fond of your new\ncousin.”\n\n“Which new cousin?” asked Gertrude.\n\n“I don’t mean the Baroness!” the young girl rejoined, with her laugh. “I\nthought you expected to see so much of him.”\n\n“Of Felix? I hope to see a great deal of him,” said Gertrude, simply.\n\n“Then why do you want to keep him out of the house?”\n\nGertrude looked at Lizzie Acton, and then looked away.\n\n“Should you want me to live in the house with you, Lizzie?” asked\nClifford.\n\n“I hope you never will. I hate you!” Such was this young lady’s reply.\n\n“Father,” said Gertrude, stopping before Mr. Wentworth and smiling, with\na smile the sweeter, as her smile always was, for its rarity; “do let\nthem live in the little house over the way. It will be lovely!”\n\nRobert Acton had been watching her. “Gertrude is right,” he said.\n“Gertrude is the cleverest girl in the world. If I might take the\nliberty, I should strongly recommend their living there.”\n\n“There is nothing there so pretty as the northeast room,” Charlotte\nurged.\n\n“She will make it pretty. Leave her alone!” Acton exclaimed.\n\nGertrude, at his compliment, had blushed and looked at him: it was as if\nsomeone less familiar had complimented her. “I am sure she will make\nit pretty. It will be very interesting. It will be a place to go to. It\nwill be a foreign house.”\n\n“Are we very sure that we need a foreign house?” Mr. Wentworth inquired.\n“Do you think it desirable to establish a foreign house--in this quiet\nplace?”\n\n“You speak,” said Acton, laughing, “as if it were a question of the poor\nBaroness opening a wine-shop or a gaming-table.”\n\n“It would be too lovely!” Gertrude declared again, laying her hand on\nthe back of her father’s chair.\n\n“That she should open a gaming-table?” Charlotte asked, with great\ngravity.\n\nGertrude looked at her a moment, and then, “Yes, Charlotte,” she said,\nsimply.\n\n“Gertrude is growing pert,” Clifford Wentworth observed, with his\nhumorous young growl. “That comes of associating with foreigners.”\n\nMr. Wentworth looked up at his daughter, who was standing beside him; he\ndrew her gently forward. “You must be careful,” he said. “You must keep\nwatch. Indeed, we must all be careful. This is a great change; we are\nto be exposed to peculiar influences. I don’t say they are bad. I don’t\njudge them in advance. But they may perhaps make it necessary that we\nshould exercise a great deal of wisdom and self-control. It will be a\ndifferent tone.”\n\nGertrude was silent a moment, in deference to her father’s speech; then\nshe spoke in a manner that was not in the least an answer to it. “I want\nto see how they will live. I am sure they will have different hours. She\nwill do all kinds of little things differently. When we go over there it\nwill be like going to Europe. She will have a boudoir. She will invite\nus to dinner--very late. She will breakfast in her room.”\n\nCharlotte gazed at her sister again. Gertrude’s imagination seemed to\nher to be fairly running riot. She had always known that Gertrude had\na great deal of imagination--she had been very proud of it. But at the\nsame time she had always felt that it was a dangerous and irresponsible\nfaculty; and now, to her sense, for the moment, it seemed to threaten to\nmake her sister a strange person who should come in suddenly, as from a\njourney, talking of the peculiar and possibly unpleasant things she had\nobserved. Charlotte’s imagination took no journeys whatever; she\nkept it, as it were, in her pocket, with the other furniture of this\nreceptacle--a thimble, a little box of peppermint, and a morsel of\ncourt-plaster. “I don’t believe she would have any dinner--or any\nbreakfast,” said Miss Wentworth. “I don’t believe she knows how to do\nanything herself. I should have to get her ever so many servants, and\nshe wouldn’t like them.”\n\n“She has a maid,” said Gertrude; “a French maid. She mentioned her.”\n\n“I wonder if the maid has a little fluted cap and red slippers,” said\nLizzie Acton. “There was a French maid in that play that Robert took me\nto see. She had pink stockings; she was very wicked.”\n\n“She was a _soubrette_,” Gertrude announced, who had never seen a play\nin her life. “They call that a soubrette. It will be a great chance to\nlearn French.” Charlotte gave a little soft, helpless groan. She had a\nvision of a wicked, theatrical person, clad in pink stockings and red\nshoes, and speaking, with confounding volubility, an incomprehensible\ntongue, flitting through the sacred penetralia of that large, clean\nhouse. “That is one reason in favor of their coming here,” Gertrude went\non. “But we can make Eugenia speak French to us, and Felix. I mean to\nbegin--the next time.”\n\nMr. Wentworth had kept her standing near him, and he gave her his\nearnest, thin, unresponsive glance again. “I want you to make me a\npromise, Gertrude,” he said.\n\n“What is it?” she asked, smiling.\n\n“Not to get excited. Not to allow these--these occurrences to be an\noccasion for excitement.”\n\nShe looked down at him a moment, and then she shook her head. “I don’t\nthink I can promise that, father. I am excited already.”\n\nMr. Wentworth was silent a while; they all were silent, as if in\nrecognition of something audacious and portentous.\n\n“I think they had better go to the other house,” said Charlotte,\nquietly.\n\n“I shall keep them in the other house,” Mr. Wentworth subjoined, more\npregnantly.\n\nGertrude turned away; then she looked across at Robert Acton. Her cousin\nRobert was a great friend of hers; she often looked at him this way\ninstead of saying things. Her glance on this occasion, however, struck\nhim as a substitute for a larger volume of diffident utterance than\nusual, inviting him to observe, among other things, the inefficiency of\nher father’s design--if design it was--for diminishing, in the\ninterest of quiet nerves, their occasions of contact with their foreign\nrelatives. But Acton immediately complimented Mr. Wentworth upon his\nliberality. “That’s a very nice thing to do,” he said, “giving them\nthe little house. You will have treated them handsomely, and, whatever\nhappens, you will be glad of it.” Mr. Wentworth was liberal, and he knew\nhe was liberal. It gave him pleasure to know it, to feel it, to see it\nrecorded; and this pleasure is the only palpable form of self-indulgence\nwith which the narrator of these incidents will be able to charge him.\n\n“A three days’ visit at most, over there, is all I should have found\npossible,” Madame Münster remarked to her brother, after they had\ntaken possession of the little white house. “It would have been too\n_intime_--decidedly too _intime_. Breakfast, dinner, and tea _en\nfamille_--it would have been the end of the world if I could have\nreached the third day.” And she made the same observation to her maid\nAugustine, an intelligent person, who enjoyed a liberal share of her\nconfidence. Felix declared that he would willingly spend his life in\nthe bosom of the Wentworth family; that they were the kindest, simplest,\nmost amiable people in the world, and that he had taken a prodigious\nfancy to them all. The Baroness quite agreed with him that they were\nsimple and kind; they were thoroughly nice people, and she liked them\nextremely. The girls were perfect ladies; it was impossible to be more\nof a lady than Charlotte Wentworth, in spite of her little village\nair. “But as for thinking them the best company in the world,” said the\nBaroness, “that is another thing; and as for wishing to live _porte à\nporte_ with them, I should as soon think of wishing myself back in the\nconvent again, to wear a bombazine apron and sleep in a dormitory.” And\nyet the Baroness was in high good humor; she had been very much pleased.\nWith her lively perception and her refined imagination, she was capable\nof enjoying anything that was characteristic, anything that was good\nof its kind. The Wentworth household seemed to her very perfect in\nits kind--wonderfully peaceful and unspotted; pervaded by a sort of\ndove-colored freshness that had all the quietude and benevolence of what\nshe deemed to be Quakerism, and yet seemed to be founded upon a degree\nof material abundance for which, in certain matters of detail, one\nmight have looked in vain at the frugal little court of\nSilberstadt-Schreckenstein. She perceived immediately that her American\nrelatives thought and talked very little about money; and this of itself\nmade an impression upon Eugenia’s imagination. She perceived at the same\ntime that if Charlotte or Gertrude should ask their father for a very\nconsiderable sum he would at once place it in their hands; and this made\na still greater impression. The greatest impression of all, perhaps,\nwas made by another rapid induction. The Baroness had an immediate\nconviction that Robert Acton would put his hand into his pocket every\nday in the week if that rattle-pated little sister of his should bid\nhim. The men in this country, said the Baroness, are evidently very\nobliging. Her declaration that she was looking for rest and retirement\nhad been by no means wholly untrue; nothing that the Baroness said was\nwholly untrue. It is but fair to add, perhaps, that nothing that she\nsaid was wholly true. She wrote to a friend in Germany that it was a\nreturn to nature; it was like drinking new milk, and she was very fond\nof new milk. She said to herself, of course, that it would be a little\ndull; but there can be no better proof of her good spirits than the fact\nthat she thought she should not mind its being a little dull. It seemed\nto her, when from the piazza of her eleemosynary cottage she looked out\nover the soundless fields, the stony pastures, the clear-faced ponds,\nthe rugged little orchards, that she had never been in the midst of\nso peculiarly intense a stillness; it was almost a delicate sensual\npleasure. It was all very good, very innocent and safe, and out of it\nsomething good must come. Augustine, indeed, who had an unbounded faith\nin her mistress’s wisdom and far-sightedness, was a great deal perplexed\nand depressed. She was always ready to take her cue when she understood\nit; but she liked to understand it, and on this occasion comprehension\nfailed. What, indeed, was the Baroness doing _dans cette galère_? what\nfish did she expect to land out of these very stagnant waters? The game\nwas evidently a deep one. Augustine could trust her; but the sense of\nwalking in the dark betrayed itself in the physiognomy of this spare,\nsober, sallow, middle-aged person, who had nothing in common with\nGertrude Wentworth’s conception of a soubrette, by the most ironical\nscowl that had ever rested upon the unpretending tokens of the peace and\nplenty of the Wentworths. Fortunately, Augustine could quench skepticism\nin action. She quite agreed with her mistress--or rather she quite\nout-stripped her mistress--in thinking that the little white house was\npitifully bare. _“Il faudra,”_ said Augustine, _“lui faire un peu de\ntoilette.”_ And she began to hang up _portières_ in the doorways;\nto place wax candles, procured after some research, in unexpected\nsituations; to dispose anomalous draperies over the arms of sofas and\nthe backs of chairs. The Baroness had brought with her to the New\nWorld a copious provision of the element of costume; and the two Miss\nWentworths, when they came over to see her, were somewhat bewildered\nby the obtrusive distribution of her wardrobe. There were India shawls\nsuspended, curtain-wise, in the parlor door, and curious fabrics,\ncorresponding to Gertrude’s metaphysical vision of an opera-cloak,\ntumbled about in the sitting-places. There were pink silk blinds in\nthe windows, by which the room was strangely bedimmed; and along the\nchimney-piece was disposed a remarkable band of velvet, covered\nwith coarse, dirty-looking lace. “I have been making myself a little\ncomfortable,” said the Baroness, much to the confusion of Charlotte,\nwho had been on the point of proposing to come and help her put her\nsuperfluous draperies away. But what Charlotte mistook for an almost\nculpably delayed subsidence Gertrude very presently perceived to be the\nmost ingenious, the most interesting, the most romantic intention. “What\nis life, indeed, without curtains?” she secretly asked herself; and\nshe appeared to herself to have been leading hitherto an existence\nsingularly garish and totally devoid of festoons.\n\nFelix was not a young man who troubled himself greatly about\nanything--least of all about the conditions of enjoyment. His faculty of\nenjoyment was so large, so unconsciously eager, that it may be said of\nit that it had a permanent advance upon embarrassment and sorrow. His\nsentient faculty was intrinsically joyous, and novelty and change were\nin themselves a delight to him. As they had come to him with a great\ndeal of frequency, his life had been more agreeable than appeared.\nNever was a nature more perfectly fortunate. It was not a restless,\napprehensive, ambitious spirit, running a race with the tyranny of fate,\nbut a temper so unsuspicious as to put Adversity off her guard, dodging\nand evading her with the easy, natural motion of a wind-shifted\nflower. Felix extracted entertainment from all things, and all his\nfaculties--his imagination, his intelligence, his affections, his\nsenses--had a hand in the game. It seemed to him that Eugenia and he had\nbeen very well treated; there was something absolutely touching in that\ncombination of paternal liberality and social considerateness which\nmarked Mr. Wentworth’s deportment. It was most uncommonly kind of him,\nfor instance, to have given them a house. Felix was positively amused at\nhaving a house of his own; for the little white cottage among the apple\ntrees--the chalet, as Madame Münster always called it--was much more\nsensibly his own than any domiciliary _quatrième_, looking upon a\ncourt, with the rent overdue. Felix had spent a good deal of his life\nin looking into courts, with a perhaps slightly tattered pair of elbows\nresting upon the ledge of a high-perched window, and the thin smoke of a\ncigarette rising into an atmosphere in which street-cries died away and\nthe vibration of chimes from ancient belfries became sensible. He had\nnever known anything so infinitely rural as these New England fields;\nand he took a great fancy to all their pastoral roughnesses. He had\nnever had a greater sense of luxurious security; and at the risk of\nmaking him seem a rather sordid adventurer I must declare that he found\nan irresistible charm in the fact that he might dine every day at his\nuncle’s. The charm was irresistible, however, because his fancy flung\na rosy light over this homely privilege. He appreciated highly the fare\nthat was set before him. There was a kind of fresh-looking abundance\nabout it which made him think that people must have lived so in\nthe mythological era, when they spread their tables upon the grass,\nreplenished them from cornucopias, and had no particular need of kitchen\nstoves. But the great thing that Felix enjoyed was having found a\nfamily--sitting in the midst of gentle, generous people whom he might\ncall by their first names. He had never known anything more charming\nthan the attention they paid to what he said. It was like a large sheet\nof clean, fine-grained drawing-paper, all ready to be washed over with\neffective splashes of water-color. He had never had any cousins, and\nhe had never before found himself in contact so unrestricted with young\nunmarried ladies. He was extremely fond of the society of ladies, and it\nwas new to him that it might be enjoyed in just this manner. At first he\nhardly knew what to make of his state of mind. It seemed to him that\nhe was in love, indiscriminately, with three girls at once. He saw that\nLizzie Acton was more brilliantly pretty than Charlotte and Gertrude;\nbut this was scarcely a superiority. His pleasure came from something\nthey had in common--a part of which was, indeed, that physical delicacy\nwhich seemed to make it proper that they should always dress in thin\nmaterials and clear colors. But they were delicate in other ways, and\nit was most agreeable to him to feel that these latter delicacies were\nappreciable by contact, as it were. He had known, fortunately, many\nvirtuous gentlewomen, but it now appeared to him that in his relations\nwith them (especially when they were unmarried) he had been looking at\npictures under glass. He perceived at present what a nuisance the glass\nhad been--how it perverted and interfered, how it caught the reflection\nof other objects and kept you walking from side to side. He had no need\nto ask himself whether Charlotte and Gertrude, and Lizzie Acton, were\nin the right light; they were always in the right light. He liked\neverything about them: he was, for instance, not at all above liking the\nfact that they had very slender feet and high insteps. He liked their\npretty noses; he liked their surprised eyes and their hesitating, not\nat all positive way of speaking; he liked so much knowing that he was\nperfectly at liberty to be alone for hours, anywhere, with either of\nthem; that preference for one to the other, as a companion of solitude,\nremained a minor affair. Charlotte Wentworth’s sweetly severe features\nwere as agreeable as Lizzie Acton’s wonderfully expressive blue eyes;\nand Gertrude’s air of being always ready to walk about and listen was\nas charming as anything else, especially as she walked very gracefully.\nAfter a while Felix began to distinguish; but even then he would often\nwish, suddenly, that they were not all so sad. Even Lizzie Acton,\nin spite of her fine little chatter and laughter, appeared sad. Even\nClifford Wentworth, who had extreme youth in his favor, and kept a buggy\nwith enormous wheels and a little sorrel mare with the prettiest legs\nin the world--even this fortunate lad was apt to have an averted,\nuncomfortable glance, and to edge away from you at times, in the manner\nof a person with a bad conscience. The only person in the circle with\nno sense of oppression of any kind was, to Felix’s perception, Robert\nActon.\n\nIt might perhaps have been feared that after the completion of those\ngraceful domiciliary embellishments which have been mentioned Madame\nMünster would have found herself confronted with alarming possibilities\nof _ennui_. But as yet she had not taken the alarm. The Baroness was a\nrestless soul, and she projected her restlessness, as it may be said,\ninto any situation that lay before her. Up to a certain point her\nrestlessness might be counted upon to entertain her. She was always\nexpecting something to happen, and, until it was disappointed,\nexpectancy itself was a delicate pleasure. What the Baroness expected\njust now it would take some ingenuity to set forth; it is enough\nthat while she looked about her she found something to occupy her\nimagination. She assured herself that she was enchanted with her new\nrelatives; she professed to herself that, like her brother, she felt\nit a sacred satisfaction to have found a family. It is certain that she\nenjoyed to the utmost the gentleness of her kinsfolk’s deference.\nShe had, first and last, received a great deal of admiration, and her\nexperience of well-turned compliments was very considerable; but she\nknew that she had never been so real a power, never counted for so\nmuch, as now when, for the first time, the standard of comparison of her\nlittle circle was a prey to vagueness. The sense, indeed, that the good\npeople about her had, as regards her remarkable self, no standard of\ncomparison at all gave her a feeling of almost illimitable power. It was\ntrue, as she said to herself, that if for this reason they would be\nable to discover nothing against her, so they would perhaps neglect\nto perceive some of her superior points; but she always wound up her\nreflections by declaring that she would take care of that.\n\nCharlotte and Gertrude were in some perplexity between their desire\nto show all proper attention to Madame Münster and their fear of being\nimportunate. The little house in the orchard had hitherto been occupied\nduring the summer months by intimate friends of the family, or by poor\nrelations who found in Mr. Wentworth a landlord attentive to repairs and\noblivious of quarter-day. Under these circumstances the open door of the\nsmall house and that of the large one, facing each other across their\nhomely gardens, levied no tax upon hourly visits. But the Misses\nWentworth received an impression that Eugenia was no friend to the\nprimitive custom of “dropping in;” she evidently had no idea of living\nwithout a door-keeper. “One goes into your house as into an inn--except\nthat there are no servants rushing forward,” she said to Charlotte. And\nshe added that that was very charming. Gertrude explained to her sister\nthat she meant just the reverse; she didn’t like it at all. Charlotte\ninquired why she should tell an untruth, and Gertrude answered that\nthere was probably some very good reason for it which they should\ndiscover when they knew her better. “There can surely be no good reason\nfor telling an untruth,” said Charlotte. “I hope she does not think so.”\n\nThey had of course desired, from the first, to do everything in the way\nof helping her to arrange herself. It had seemed to Charlotte that\nthere would be a great many things to talk about; but the Baroness was\napparently inclined to talk about nothing.\n\n“Write her a note, asking her leave to come and see her. I think that is\nwhat she will like,” said Gertrude.\n\n“Why should I give her the trouble of answering me?” Charlotte asked.\n“She will have to write a note and send it over.”\n\n“I don’t think she will take any trouble,” said Gertrude, profoundly.\n\n“What then will she do?”\n\n“That is what I am curious to see,” said Gertrude, leaving her sister\nwith an impression that her curiosity was morbid.\n\nThey went to see the Baroness without preliminary correspondence; and in\nthe little salon which she had already created, with its becoming light\nand its festoons, they found Robert Acton.\n\nEugenia was intensely gracious, but she accused them of neglecting her\ncruelly. “You see Mr. Acton has had to take pity upon me,” she said. “My\nbrother goes off sketching, for hours; I can never depend upon him. So I\nwas to send Mr. Acton to beg you to come and give me the benefit of your\nwisdom.”\n\nGertrude looked at her sister. She wanted to say, “_That_ is what she\nwould have done.” Charlotte said that they hoped the Baroness would\nalways come and dine with them; it would give them so much pleasure;\nand, in that case, she would spare herself the trouble of having a cook.\n\n“Ah, but I must have a cook!” cried the Baroness. “An old negress in a\nyellow turban. I have set my heart upon that. I want to look out of my\nwindow and see her sitting there on the grass, against the background of\nthose crooked, dusky little apple trees, pulling the husks off a lapful\nof Indian corn. That will be local color, you know. There isn’t much of\nit here--you don’t mind my saying that, do you?--so one must make\nthe most of what one can get. I shall be most happy to dine with you\nwhenever you will let me; but I want to be able to ask you sometimes.\nAnd I want to be able to ask Mr. Acton,” added the Baroness.\n\n“You must come and ask me at home,” said Acton. “You must come and see\nme; you must dine with me first. I want to show you my place; I want to\nintroduce you to my mother.” He called again upon Madame Münster, two\ndays later. He was constantly at the other house; he used to walk across\nthe fields from his own place, and he appeared to have fewer scruples\nthan his cousins with regard to dropping in. On this occasion he found\nthat Mr. Brand had come to pay his respects to the charming stranger;\nbut after Acton’s arrival the young theologian said nothing. He sat in\nhis chair with his two hands clasped, fixing upon his hostess a grave,\nfascinated stare. The Baroness talked to Robert Acton, but, as she\ntalked, she turned and smiled at Mr. Brand, who never took his eyes\noff her. The two men walked away together; they were going to Mr.\nWentworth’s. Mr. Brand still said nothing; but after they had passed\ninto Mr. Wentworth’s garden he stopped and looked back for some time at\nthe little white house. Then, looking at his companion, with his head\nbent a little to one side and his eyes somewhat contracted, “Now\nI suppose that’s what is called conversation,” he said; “real\nconversation.”\n\n“It’s what I call a very clever woman,” said Acton, laughing.\n\n“It is most interesting,” Mr. Brand continued. “I only wish she would\nspeak French; it would seem more in keeping. It must be quite the\nstyle that we have heard about, that we have read about--the style of\nconversation of Madame de Staël, of Madame Récamier.”\n\nActon also looked at Madame Münster’s residence among its hollyhocks and\napple trees. “What I should like to know,” he said, smiling, “is just\nwhat has brought Madame Récamier to live in that place!”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nMr. Wentworth, with his cane and his gloves in his hand, went every\nafternoon to call upon his niece. A couple of hours later she came over\nto the great house to tea. She had let the proposal that she should\nregularly dine there fall to the ground; she was in the enjoyment of\nwhatever satisfaction was to be derived from the spectacle of an\nold negress in a crimson turban shelling peas under the apple trees.\nCharlotte, who had provided the ancient negress, thought it must be\na strange household, Eugenia having told her that Augustine managed\neverything, the ancient negress included--Augustine who was naturally\ndevoid of all acquaintance with the expurgatory English tongue. By far\nthe most immoral sentiment which I shall have occasion to attribute to\nCharlotte Wentworth was a certain emotion of disappointment at finding\nthat, in spite of these irregular conditions, the domestic arrangements\nat the small house were apparently not--from Eugenia’s peculiar point of\nview--strikingly offensive. The Baroness found it amusing to go to tea;\nshe dressed as if for dinner. The tea-table offered an anomalous and\npicturesque repast; and on leaving it they all sat and talked in the\nlarge piazza, or wandered about the garden in the starlight, with their\nears full of those sounds of strange insects which, though they are\nsupposed to be, all over the world, a part of the magic of summer\nnights, seemed to the Baroness to have beneath these western skies an\nincomparable resonance.\n\nMr. Wentworth, though, as I say, he went punctiliously to call upon her,\nwas not able to feel that he was getting used to his niece. It taxed his\nimagination to believe that she was really his half-sister’s child. His\nsister was a figure of his early years; she had been only twenty when\nshe went abroad, never to return, making in foreign parts a willful and\nundesirable marriage. His aunt, Mrs. Whiteside, who had taken her to\nEurope for the benefit of the tour, gave, on her return, so lamentable\nan account of Mr. Adolphus Young, to whom the headstrong girl had united\nher destiny, that it operated as a chill upon family feeling--especially\nin the case of the half-brothers. Catherine had done nothing\nsubsequently to propitiate her family; she had not even written to\nthem in a way that indicated a lucid appreciation of their suspended\nsympathy; so that it had become a tradition in Boston circles that the\nhighest charity, as regards this young lady, was to think it well to\nforget her, and to abstain from conjecture as to the extent to which\nher aberrations were reproduced in her descendants. Over these young\npeople--a vague report of their existence had come to his ears--Mr.\nWentworth had not, in the course of years, allowed his imagination to\nhover. It had plenty of occupation nearer home, and though he had many\ncares upon his conscience the idea that he had been an unnatural uncle\nwas, very properly, never among the number. Now that his nephew and\nniece had come before him, he perceived that they were the fruit of\ninfluences and circumstances very different from those under which his\nown familiar progeny had reached a vaguely-qualified maturity. He felt\nno provocation to say that these influences had been exerted for evil;\nbut he was sometimes afraid that he should not be able to like\nhis distinguished, delicate, lady-like niece. He was paralyzed and\nbewildered by her foreignness. She spoke, somehow, a different language.\nThere was something strange in her words. He had a feeling that another\nman, in his place, would accommodate himself to her tone; would ask\nher questions and joke with her, reply to those pleasantries of her\nown which sometimes seemed startling as addressed to an uncle. But Mr.\nWentworth could not do these things. He could not even bring himself\nto attempt to measure her position in the world. She was the wife of\na foreign nobleman who desired to repudiate her. This had a singular\nsound, but the old man felt himself destitute of the materials for\na judgment. It seemed to him that he ought to find them in his own\nexperience, as a man of the world and an almost public character; but\nthey were not there, and he was ashamed to confess to himself--much\nmore to reveal to Eugenia by interrogations possibly too innocent--the\nunfurnished condition of this repository.\n\nIt appeared to him that he could get much nearer, as he would have said,\nto his nephew; though he was not sure that Felix was altogether safe. He\nwas so bright and handsome and talkative that it was impossible not to\nthink well of him; and yet it seemed as if there were something almost\nimpudent, almost vicious--or as if there ought to be--in a young man\nbeing at once so joyous and so positive. It was to be observed that\nwhile Felix was not at all a serious young man there was somehow more of\nhim--he had more weight and volume and resonance--than a number of young\nmen who were distinctly serious. While Mr. Wentworth meditated upon this\nanomaly his nephew was admiring him unrestrictedly. He thought him a\nmost delicate, generous, high-toned old gentleman, with a very handsome\nhead, of the ascetic type, which he promised himself the profit of\nsketching. Felix was far from having made a secret of the fact that he\nwielded the paint-brush, and it was not his own fault if it failed to be\ngenerally understood that he was prepared to execute the most striking\nlikenesses on the most reasonable terms. “He is an artist--my cousin is\nan artist,” said Gertrude; and she offered this information to everyone\nwho would receive it. She offered it to herself, as it were, by way\nof admonition and reminder; she repeated to herself at odd moments,\nin lonely places, that Felix was invested with this sacred character.\nGertrude had never seen an artist before; she had only read about such\npeople. They seemed to her a romantic and mysterious class, whose life\nwas made up of those agreeable accidents that never happened to other\npersons. And it merely quickened her meditations on this point that\nFelix should declare, as he repeatedly did, that he was really not an\nartist. “I have never gone into the thing seriously,” he said. “I have\nnever studied; I have had no training. I do a little of everything, and\nnothing well. I am only an amateur.”\n\nIt pleased Gertrude even more to think that he was an amateur than to\nthink that he was an artist; the former word, to her fancy, had an even\nsubtler connotation. She knew, however, that it was a word to use\nmore soberly. Mr. Wentworth used it freely; for though he had not\nbeen exactly familiar with it, he found it convenient as a help toward\nclassifying Felix, who, as a young man extremely clever and active and\napparently respectable and yet not engaged in any recognized business,\nwas an importunate anomaly. Of course the Baroness and her brother--she\nwas always spoken of first--were a welcome topic of conversation between\nMr. Wentworth and his daughters and their occasional visitors.\n\n“And the young man, your nephew, what is his profession?” asked an\nold gentleman--Mr. Broderip, of Salem--who had been Mr. Wentworth’s\nclassmate at Harvard College in the year 1809, and who came into his\noffice in Devonshire Street. (Mr. Wentworth, in his later years, used to\ngo but three times a week to his office, where he had a large amount of\nhighly confidential trust-business to transact.)\n\n“Well, he’s an amateur,” said Felix’s uncle, with folded hands, and with\na certain satisfaction in being able to say it. And Mr. Broderip had\ngone back to Salem with a feeling that this was probably a “European”\n expression for a broker or a grain exporter.\n\n“I should like to do your head, sir,” said Felix to his uncle one\nevening, before them all--Mr. Brand and Robert Acton being also present.\n“I think I should make a very fine thing of it. It’s an interesting\nhead; it’s very mediaeval.”\n\nMr. Wentworth looked grave; he felt awkwardly, as if all the company had\ncome in and found him standing before the looking-glass. “The Lord made\nit,” he said. “I don’t think it is for man to make it over again.”\n\n“Certainly the Lord made it,” replied Felix, laughing, “and he made\nit very well. But life has been touching up the work. It is a very\ninteresting type of head. It’s delightfully wasted and emaciated. The\ncomplexion is wonderfully bleached.” And Felix looked round at the\ncircle, as if to call their attention to these interesting points.\nMr. Wentworth grew visibly paler. “I should like to do you as an old\nprelate, an old cardinal, or the prior of an order.”\n\n“A prelate, a cardinal?” murmured Mr. Wentworth. “Do you refer to the\nRoman Catholic priesthood?”\n\n“I mean an old ecclesiastic who should have led a very pure, abstinent\nlife. Now I take it that has been the case with you, sir; one sees it in\nyour face,” Felix proceeded. “You have been very--a very moderate. Don’t\nyou think one always sees that in a man’s face?”\n\n“You see more in a man’s face than I should think of looking for,” said\nMr. Wentworth coldly.\n\nThe Baroness rattled her fan, and gave her brilliant laugh. “It is a\nrisk to look so close!” she exclaimed. “My uncle has some peccadilloes\non his conscience.” Mr. Wentworth looked at her, painfully at a loss;\nand in so far as the signs of a pure and abstinent life were visible in\nhis face they were then probably peculiarly manifest. “You are a _beau\nvieillard_, dear uncle,” said Madame Münster, smiling with her foreign\neyes.\n\n“I think you are paying me a compliment,” said the old man.\n\n“Surely, I am not the first woman that ever did so!” cried the Baroness.\n\n“I think you are,” said Mr. Wentworth gravely. And turning to Felix he\nadded, in the same tone, “Please don’t take my likeness. My children\nhave my daguerreotype. That is quite satisfactory.”\n\n“I won’t promise,” said Felix, “not to work your head into something!”\n\nMr. Wentworth looked at him and then at all the others; then he got up\nand slowly walked away.\n\n“Felix,” said Gertrude, in the silence that followed, “I wish you would\npaint my portrait.”\n\nCharlotte wondered whether Gertrude was right in wishing this; and she\nlooked at Mr. Brand as the most legitimate way of ascertaining. Whatever\nGertrude did or said, Charlotte always looked at Mr. Brand. It was a\nstanding pretext for looking at Mr. Brand--always, as Charlotte thought,\nin the interest of Gertrude’s welfare. It is true that she felt a\ntremulous interest in Gertrude being right; for Charlotte, in her small,\nstill way, was an heroic sister.\n\n“We should be glad to have your portrait, Miss Gertrude,” said Mr.\nBrand.\n\n“I should be delighted to paint so charming a model,” Felix declared.\n\n“Do you think you are so lovely, my dear?” asked Lizzie Acton, with her\nlittle inoffensive pertness, biting off a knot in her knitting.\n\n“It is not because I think I am beautiful,” said Gertrude, looking all\nround. “I don’t think I am beautiful, at all.” She spoke with a sort\nof conscious deliberateness; and it seemed very strange to Charlotte to\nhear her discussing this question so publicly. “It is because I think it\nwould be amusing to sit and be painted. I have always thought that.”\n\n“I am sorry you have not had better things to think about, my daughter,”\n said Mr. Wentworth.\n\n“You are very beautiful, cousin Gertrude,” Felix declared.\n\n“That’s a compliment,” said Gertrude. “I put all the compliments I\nreceive into a little money-jug that has a slit in the side. I shake\nthem up and down, and they rattle. There are not many yet--only two or\nthree.”\n\n“No, it’s not a compliment,” Felix rejoined. “See; I am careful not to\ngive it the form of a compliment. I didn’t think you were beautiful at\nfirst. But you have come to seem so little by little.”\n\n“Take care, now, your jug doesn’t burst!” exclaimed Lizzie.\n\n“I think sitting for one’s portrait is only one of the various forms of\nidleness,” said Mr. Wentworth. “Their name is legion.”\n\n“My dear sir,” cried Felix, “you can’t be said to be idle when you are\nmaking a man work so!”\n\n“One might be painted while one is asleep,” suggested Mr. Brand, as a\ncontribution to the discussion.\n\n“Ah, do paint me while I am asleep,” said Gertrude to Felix, smiling.\nAnd she closed her eyes a little. It had by this time become a matter of\nalmost exciting anxiety to Charlotte what Gertrude would say or would do\nnext.\n\nShe began to sit for her portrait on the following day--in the open\nair, on the north side of the piazza. “I wish you would tell me what you\nthink of us--how we seem to you,” she said to Felix, as he sat before\nhis easel.\n\n“You seem to me the best people in the world,” said Felix.\n\n“You say that,” Gertrude resumed, “because it saves you the trouble of\nsaying anything else.”\n\nThe young man glanced at her over the top of his canvas. “What else\nshould I say? It would certainly be a great deal of trouble to say\nanything different.”\n\n“Well,” said Gertrude, “you have seen people before that you have liked,\nhave you not?”\n\n“Indeed I have, thank Heaven!”\n\n“And they have been very different from us,” Gertrude went on.\n\n“That only proves,” said Felix, “that there are a thousand different\nways of being good company.”\n\n“Do you think us good company?” asked Gertrude.\n\n“Company for a king!”\n\nGertrude was silent a moment; and then, “There must be a thousand\ndifferent ways of being dreary,” she said; “and sometimes I think we\nmake use of them all.”\n\nFelix stood up quickly, holding up his hand. “If you could only keep\nthat look on your face for half an hour--while I catch it!” he said. “It\nis uncommonly handsome.”\n\n“To look handsome for half an hour--that is a great deal to ask of me,”\n she answered.\n\n“It would be the portrait of a young woman who has taken some vow, some\npledge, that she repents of,” said Felix, “and who is thinking it over\nat leisure.”\n\n“I have taken no vow, no pledge,” said Gertrude, very gravely; “I have\nnothing to repent of.”\n\n“My dear cousin, that was only a figure of speech. I am very sure that\nno one in your excellent family has anything to repent of.”\n\n“And yet we are always repenting!” Gertrude exclaimed. “That is what I\nmean by our being dreary. You know it perfectly well; you only pretend\nthat you don’t.”\n\nFelix gave a quick laugh. “The half hour is going on, and yet you are\nhandsomer than ever. One must be careful what one says, you see.”\n\n“To me,” said Gertrude, “you can say anything.”\n\nFelix looked at her, as an artist might, and painted for some time in\nsilence.\n\n“Yes, you seem to me different from your father and sister--from most of\nthe people you have lived with,” he observed.\n\n“To say that one’s self,” Gertrude went on, “is like saying--by\nimplication, at least--that one is better. I am not better; I am much\nworse. But they say themselves that I am different. It makes them\nunhappy.”\n\n“Since you accuse me of concealing my real impressions, I may admit that\nI think the tendency--among you generally--is to be made unhappy too\neasily.”\n\n“I wish you would tell that to my father,” said Gertrude.\n\n“It might make him more unhappy!” Felix exclaimed, laughing.\n\n“It certainly would. I don’t believe you have seen people like that.”\n\n“Ah, my dear cousin, how do you know what I have seen?” Felix demanded.\n“How can I tell you?”\n\n“You might tell me a great many things, if you only would. You have\nseen people like yourself--people who are bright and gay and fond of\namusement. We are not fond of amusement.”\n\n“Yes,” said Felix, “I confess that rather strikes me. You don’t seem to\nme to get all the pleasure out of life that you might. You don’t seem to\nme to enjoy..... Do you mind my saying this?” he asked, pausing.\n\n“Please go on,” said the girl, earnestly.\n\n“You seem to me very well placed for enjoying. You have money and\nliberty and what is called in Europe a ‘position.’ But you take a\npainful view of life, as one may say.”\n\n“One ought to think it bright and charming and delightful, eh?” asked\nGertrude.\n\n“I should say so--if one can. It is true it all depends upon that,”\n Felix added.\n\n“You know there is a great deal of misery in the world,” said his model.\n\n“I have seen a little of it,” the young man rejoined. “But it was all\nover there--beyond the sea. I don’t see any here. This is a paradise.”\n\nGertrude said nothing; she sat looking at the dahlias and the\ncurrant-bushes in the garden, while Felix went on with his work. “To\n‘enjoy,’” she began at last, “to take life--not painfully, must one do\nsomething wrong?”\n\nFelix gave his long, light laugh again. “Seriously, I think not. And for\nthis reason, among others: you strike me as very capable of enjoying,\nif the chance were given you, and yet at the same time as incapable of\nwrong-doing.”\n\n“I am sure,” said Gertrude, “that you are very wrong in telling a person\nthat she is incapable of that. We are never nearer to evil than when we\nbelieve that.”\n\n“You are handsomer than ever,” observed Felix, irrelevantly.\n\nGertrude had got used to hearing him say this. There was not so much\nexcitement in it as at first. “What ought one to do?” she continued. “To\ngive parties, to go to the theatre, to read novels, to keep late hours?”\n\n“I don’t think it’s what one does or one doesn’t do that promotes\nenjoyment,” her companion answered. “It is the general way of looking at\nlife.”\n\n“They look at it as a discipline--that’s what they do here. I have often\nbeen told that.”\n\n“Well, that’s very good. But there is another way,” added Felix,\nsmiling: “to look at it as an opportunity.”\n\n“An opportunity--yes,” said Gertrude. “One would get more pleasure that\nway.”\n\n“I don’t attempt to say anything better for it than that it has been my\nown way--and that is not saying much!” Felix had laid down his palette\nand brushes; he was leaning back, with his arms folded, to judge\nthe effect of his work. “And you know,” he said, “I am a very petty\npersonage.”\n\n“You have a great deal of talent,” said Gertrude.\n\n“No--no,” the young man rejoined, in a tone of cheerful impartiality,\n“I have not a great deal of talent. It is nothing at all remarkable.\nI assure you I should know if it were. I shall always be obscure. The\nworld will never hear of me.” Gertrude looked at him with a strange\nfeeling. She was thinking of the great world which he knew and which she\ndid not, and how full of brilliant talents it must be, since it could\nafford to make light of his abilities. “You needn’t in general attach\nmuch importance to anything I tell you,” he pursued; “but you may\nbelieve me when I say this,--that I am little better than a good-natured\nfeather-head.”\n\n“A feather-head?” she repeated.\n\n“I am a species of Bohemian.”\n\n“A Bohemian?” Gertrude had never heard this term before, save as a\ngeographical denomination; and she quite failed to understand the\nfigurative meaning which her companion appeared to attach to it. But it\ngave her pleasure.\n\nFelix had pushed back his chair and risen to his feet; he slowly came\ntoward her, smiling. “I am a sort of adventurer,” he said, looking down\nat her.\n\nShe got up, meeting his smile. “An adventurer?” she repeated. “I should\nlike to hear your adventures.”\n\nFor an instant she believed that he was going to take her hand; but he\ndropped his own hands suddenly into the pockets of his painting-jacket.\n“There is no reason why you shouldn’t,” he said. “I have been an\nadventurer, but my adventures have been very innocent. They have all\nbeen happy ones; I don’t think there are any I shouldn’t tell. They were\nvery pleasant and very pretty; I should like to go over them in memory.\nSit down again, and I will begin,” he added in a moment, with his\nnaturally persuasive smile.\n\nGertrude sat down again on that day, and she sat down on several other\ndays. Felix, while he plied his brush, told her a great many stories,\nand she listened with charmed avidity. Her eyes rested upon his lips;\nshe was very serious; sometimes, from her air of wondering gravity, he\nthought she was displeased. But Felix never believed for more than a\nsingle moment in any displeasure of his own producing. This would have\nbeen fatuity if the optimism it expressed had not been much more a hope\nthan a prejudice. It is beside the matter to say that he had a good\nconscience; for the best conscience is a sort of self-reproach, and this\nyoung man’s brilliantly healthy nature spent itself in objective good\nintentions which were ignorant of any test save exactness in hitting\ntheir mark. He told Gertrude how he had walked over France and Italy\nwith a painter’s knapsack on his back, paying his way often by knocking\noff a flattering portrait of his host or hostess. He told her how he\nhad played the violin in a little band of musicians--not of high\ncelebrity--who traveled through foreign lands giving provincial\nconcerts. He told her also how he had been a momentary ornament of a\ntroupe of strolling actors, engaged in the arduous task of interpreting\nShakespeare to French and German, Polish and Hungarian audiences.\n\nWhile this periodical recital was going on, Gertrude lived in a\nfantastic world; she seemed to herself to be reading a romance that\ncame out in daily numbers. She had known nothing so delightful since\nthe perusal of _Nicholas Nickleby_. One afternoon she went to see her\ncousin, Mrs. Acton, Robert’s mother, who was a great invalid, never\nleaving the house. She came back alone, on foot, across the fields--this\nbeing a short way which they often used. Felix had gone to Boston with\nher father, who desired to take the young man to call upon some of his\nfriends, old gentlemen who remembered his mother--remembered her, but\nsaid nothing about her--and several of whom, with the gentle ladies\ntheir wives, had driven out from town to pay their respects at the\nlittle house among the apple trees, in vehicles which reminded the\nBaroness, who received her visitors with discriminating civility, of\nthe large, light, rattling barouche in which she herself had made her\njourney to this neighborhood. The afternoon was waning; in the western\nsky the great picture of a New England sunset, painted in crimson\nand silver, was suspended from the zenith; and the stony pastures, as\nGertrude traversed them, thinking intently to herself, were covered with\na light, clear glow. At the open gate of one of the fields she saw from\nthe distance a man’s figure; he stood there as if he were waiting for\nher, and as she came nearer she recognized Mr. Brand. She had a feeling\nas of not having seen him for some time; she could not have said for\nhow long, for it yet seemed to her that he had been very lately at the\nhouse.\n\n“May I walk back with you?” he asked. And when she had said that he\nmight if he wanted, he observed that he had seen her and recognized her\nhalf a mile away.\n\n“You must have very good eyes,” said Gertrude.\n\n“Yes, I have very good eyes, Miss Gertrude,” said Mr. Brand. She\nperceived that he meant something; but for a long time past Mr. Brand\nhad constantly meant something, and she had almost got used to it. She\nfelt, however, that what he meant had now a renewed power to disturb\nher, to perplex and agitate her. He walked beside her in silence for a\nmoment, and then he added, “I have had no trouble in seeing that you are\nbeginning to avoid me. But perhaps,” he went on, “one needn’t have had\nvery good eyes to see that.”\n\n“I have not avoided you,” said Gertrude, without looking at him.\n\n“I think you have been unconscious that you were avoiding me,” Mr. Brand\nreplied. “You have not even known that I was there.”\n\n“Well, you are here now, Mr. Brand!” said Gertrude, with a little laugh.\n“I know that very well.”\n\nHe made no rejoinder. He simply walked beside her slowly, as they were\nobliged to walk over the soft grass. Presently they came to another\ngate, which was closed. Mr. Brand laid his hand upon it, but he made no\nmovement to open it; he stood and looked at his companion. “You are very\nmuch interested--very much absorbed,” he said.\n\nGertrude glanced at him; she saw that he was pale and that he looked\nexcited. She had never seen Mr. Brand excited before, and she felt\nthat the spectacle, if fully carried out, would be impressive, almost\npainful. “Absorbed in what?” she asked. Then she looked away at the\nilluminated sky. She felt guilty and uncomfortable, and yet she was\nvexed with herself for feeling so. But Mr. Brand, as he stood there\nlooking at her with his small, kind, persistent eyes, represented an\nimmense body of half-obliterated obligations, that were rising again\ninto a certain distinctness.\n\n“You have new interests, new occupations,” he went on. “I don’t know\nthat I can say that you have new duties. We have always old ones,\nGertrude,” he added.\n\n“Please open the gate, Mr. Brand,” she said; and she felt as if, in\nsaying so, she were cowardly and petulant. But he opened the gate, and\nallowed her to pass; then he closed it behind himself. Before she had\ntime to turn away he put out his hand and held her an instant by the\nwrist.\n\n“I want to say something to you,” he said.\n\n“I know what you want to say,” she answered. And she was on the point of\nadding, “And I know just how you will say it;” but these words she kept\nback.\n\n“I love you, Gertrude,” he said. “I love you very much; I love you more\nthan ever.”\n\nHe said the words just as she had known he would; she had heard them\nbefore. They had no charm for her; she had said to herself before that\nit was very strange. It was supposed to be delightful for a woman to\nlisten to such words; but these seemed to her flat and mechanical. “I\nwish you would forget that,” she declared.\n\n“How can I--why should I?” he asked.\n\n“I have made you no promise--given you no pledge,” she said, looking at\nhim, with her voice trembling a little.\n\n“You have let me feel that I have an influence over you. You have opened\nyour mind to me.”\n\n“I never opened my mind to you, Mr. Brand!” Gertrude cried, with some\nvehemence.\n\n“Then you were not so frank as I thought--as we all thought.”\n\n“I don’t see what anyone else had to do with it!” cried the girl.\n\n“I mean your father and your sister. You know it makes them happy to\nthink you will listen to me.”\n\nShe gave a little laugh. “It doesn’t make them happy,” she said.\n“Nothing makes them happy. No one is happy here.”\n\n“I think your cousin is very happy--Mr. Young,” rejoined Mr. Brand, in a\nsoft, almost timid tone.\n\n“So much the better for him!” And Gertrude gave her little laugh again.\n\nThe young man looked at her a moment. “You are very much changed,” he\nsaid.\n\n“I am glad to hear it,” Gertrude declared.\n\n“I am not. I have known you a long time, and I have loved you as you\nwere.”\n\n“I am much obliged to you,” said Gertrude. “I must be going home.”\n\nHe on his side, gave a little laugh.\n\n“You certainly do avoid me--you see!”\n\n“Avoid me, then,” said the girl.\n\nHe looked at her again; and then, very gently, “No I will not avoid\nyou,” he replied; “but I will leave you, for the present, to yourself.\nI think you will remember--after a while--some of the things you have\nforgotten. I think you will come back to me; I have great faith in\nthat.”\n\nThis time his voice was very touching; there was a strong, reproachful\nforce in what he said, and Gertrude could answer nothing. He turned\naway and stood there, leaning his elbows on the gate and looking at the\nbeautiful sunset. Gertrude left him and took her way home again; but\nwhen she reached the middle of the next field she suddenly burst into\ntears. Her tears seemed to her to have been a long time gathering, and\nfor some moments it was a kind of glee to shed them. But they presently\npassed away. There was something a little hard about Gertrude; and she\nnever wept again.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nGoing of an afternoon to call upon his niece, Mr. Wentworth more than\nonce found Robert Acton sitting in her little drawing-room. This was in\nno degree, to Mr. Wentworth, a perturbing fact, for he had no sense\nof competing with his young kinsman for Eugenia’s good graces. Madame\nMünster’s uncle had the highest opinion of Robert Acton, who, indeed, in\nthe family at large, was the object of a great deal of undemonstrative\nappreciation. They were all proud of him, in so far as the charge\nof being proud may be brought against people who were, habitually,\ndistinctly guiltless of the misdemeanor known as “taking credit.” They\nnever boasted of Robert Acton, nor indulged in vainglorious reference to\nhim; they never quoted the clever things he had said, nor mentioned the\ngenerous things he had done. But a sort of frigidly-tender faith in\nhis unlimited goodness was a part of their personal sense of right; and\nthere can, perhaps, be no better proof of the high esteem in which he\nwas held than the fact that no explicit judgment was ever passed upon\nhis actions. He was no more praised than he was blamed; but he was\ntacitly felt to be an ornament to his circle. He was the man of the\nworld of the family. He had been to China and brought home a collection\nof curiosities; he had made a fortune--or rather he had quintupled a\nfortune already considerable; he was distinguished by that combination\nof celibacy, “property,” and good humor which appeals to even the\nmost subdued imaginations; and it was taken for granted that he would\npresently place these advantages at the disposal of some well-regulated\nyoung woman of his own “set.” Mr. Wentworth was not a man to admit to\nhimself that--his paternal duties apart--he liked any individual much\nbetter than all other individuals; but he thought Robert Acton extremely\njudicious; and this was perhaps as near an approach as he was capable of\nto the eagerness of preference, which his temperament repudiated as it\nwould have disengaged itself from something slightly unchaste. Acton\nwas, in fact, very judicious--and something more beside; and indeed it\nmust be claimed for Mr. Wentworth that in the more illicit parts of\nhis preference there hovered the vague adumbration of a belief that\nhis cousin’s final merit was a certain enviable capacity for whistling,\nrather gallantly, at the sanctions of mere judgment--for showing a\nlarger courage, a finer quality of pluck, than common occasion demanded.\nMr. Wentworth would never have risked the intimation that Acton was\nmade, in the smallest degree, of the stuff of a hero; but this is small\nblame to him, for Robert would certainly never have risked it himself.\nActon certainly exercised great discretion in all things--beginning with\nhis estimate of himself. He knew that he was by no means so much of a\nman of the world as he was supposed to be in local circles; but it must\nbe added that he knew also that his natural shrewdness had a reach\nof which he had never quite given local circles the measure. He was\naddicted to taking the humorous view of things, and he had discovered\nthat even in the narrowest circles such a disposition may find frequent\nopportunities. Such opportunities had formed for some time--that is,\nsince his return from China, a year and a half before--the most active\nelement in this gentleman’s life, which had just now a rather indolent\nair. He was perfectly willing to get married. He was very fond of\nbooks, and he had a handsome library; that is, his books were much more\nnumerous than Mr. Wentworth’s. He was also very fond of pictures; but it\nmust be confessed, in the fierce light of contemporary criticism, that\nhis walls were adorned with several rather abortive masterpieces. He had\ngot his learning--and there was more of it than commonly appeared--at\nHarvard College; and he took a pleasure in old associations, which made\nit a part of his daily contentment to live so near this institution that\nhe often passed it in driving to Boston. He was extremely interested in\nthe Baroness Münster.\n\nShe was very frank with him; or at least she intended to be. “I am\nsure you find it very strange that I should have settled down in this\nout-of-the-way part of the world!” she said to him three or four weeks\nafter she had installed herself. “I am certain you are wondering about\nmy motives. They are very pure.” The Baroness by this time was an old\ninhabitant; the best society in Boston had called upon her, and Clifford\nWentworth had taken her several times to drive in his buggy.\n\nRobert Acton was seated near her, playing with a fan; there were\nalways several fans lying about her drawing-room, with long ribbons of\ndifferent colors attached to them, and Acton was always playing with\none. “No, I don’t find it at all strange,” he said slowly, smiling.\n“That a clever woman should turn up in Boston, or its suburbs--that does\nnot require so much explanation. Boston is a very nice place.”\n\n“If you wish to make me contradict you,” said the Baroness, “_vous vous\ny prenez mal_. In certain moods there is nothing I am not capable\nof agreeing to. Boston is a paradise, and we are in the suburbs of\nParadise.”\n\n“Just now I am not at all in the suburbs; I am in the place itself,”\n rejoined Acton, who was lounging a little in his chair. He was, however,\nnot always lounging; and when he was he was not quite so relaxed as he\npretended. To a certain extent, he sought refuge from shyness in\nthis appearance of relaxation; and like many persons in the same\ncircumstances he somewhat exaggerated the appearance. Beyond this, the\nair of being much at his ease was a cover for vigilant observation. He\nwas more than interested in this clever woman, who, whatever he might\nsay, was clever not at all after the Boston fashion; she plunged him\ninto a kind of excitement, held him in vague suspense. He was obliged to\nadmit to himself that he had never yet seen a woman just like this--not\neven in China. He was ashamed, for inscrutable reasons, of the vivacity\nof his emotion, and he carried it off, superficially, by taking, still\nsuperficially, the humorous view of Madame Münster. It was not at all\ntrue that he thought it very natural of her to have made this pious\npilgrimage. It might have been said of him in advance that he was too\ngood a Bostonian to regard in the light of an eccentricity the desire of\neven the remotest alien to visit the New England metropolis. This was an\nimpulse for which, surely, no apology was needed; and Madame Münster\nwas the fortunate possessor of several New England cousins. In fact,\nhowever, Madame Münster struck him as out of keeping with her little\ncircle; she was at the best a very agreeable, a gracefully mystifying\nanomaly. He knew very well that it would not do to address these\nreflections too crudely to Mr. Wentworth; he would never have remarked\nto the old gentleman that he wondered what the Baroness was up to. And\nindeed he had no great desire to share his vague mistrust with anyone.\nThere was a personal pleasure in it; the greatest pleasure he had known\nat least since he had come from China. He would keep the Baroness, for\nbetter or worse, to himself; he had a feeling that he deserved to\nenjoy a monopoly of her, for he was certainly the person who had most\nadequately gauged her capacity for social intercourse. Before long it\nbecame apparent to him that the Baroness was disposed to lay no tax upon\nsuch a monopoly.\n\nOne day (he was sitting there again and playing with a fan) she asked\nhim to apologize, should the occasion present itself, to certain people\nin Boston for her not having returned their calls. “There are half a\ndozen places,” she said; “a formidable list. Charlotte Wentworth has\nwritten it out for me, in a terrifically distinct hand. There is\nno ambiguity on the subject; I know perfectly where I must go. Mr.\nWentworth informs me that the carriage is always at my disposal, and\nCharlotte offers to go with me, in a pair of tight gloves and a very\nstiff petticoat. And yet for three days I have been putting it off. They\nmust think me horribly vicious.”\n\n“You ask me to apologize,” said Acton, “but you don’t tell me what\nexcuse I can offer.”\n\n“That is more,” the Baroness declared, “than I am held to. It would be\nlike my asking you to buy me a bouquet and giving you the money. I have\nno reason except that--somehow--it’s too violent an effort. It is not\ninspiring. Wouldn’t that serve as an excuse, in Boston? I am told they\nare very sincere; they don’t tell fibs. And then Felix ought to go with\nme, and he is never in readiness. I don’t see him. He is always roaming\nabout the fields and sketching old barns, or taking ten-mile walks, or\npainting someone’s portrait, or rowing on the pond, or flirting with\nGertrude Wentworth.”\n\n“I should think it would amuse you to go and see a few people,” said\nActon. “You are having a very quiet time of it here. It’s a dull life\nfor you.”\n\n“Ah, the quiet,--the quiet!” the Baroness exclaimed. “That’s what I\nlike. It’s rest. That’s what I came here for. Amusement? I have had\namusement. And as for seeing people--I have already seen a great many\nin my life. If it didn’t sound ungracious I should say that I wish very\nhumbly your people here would leave me alone!”\n\nActon looked at her a moment, and she looked at him. She was a woman who\ntook being looked at remarkably well. “So you have come here for rest?”\n he asked.\n\n“So I may say. I came for many of those reasons that are no\nreasons--don’t you know?--and yet that are really the best: to come\naway, to change, to break with everything. When once one comes away one\nmust arrive somewhere, and I asked myself why I shouldn’t arrive here.”\n\n“You certainly had time on the way!” said Acton, laughing.\n\nMadame Münster looked at him again; and then, smiling: “And I have\ncertainly had time, since I got here, to ask myself why I came. However,\nI never ask myself idle questions. Here I am, and it seems to me you\nought only to thank me.”\n\n“When you go away you will see the difficulties I shall put in your\npath.”\n\n“You mean to put difficulties in my path?” she asked, rearranging the\nrosebud in her corsage.\n\n“The greatest of all--that of having been so agreeable----”\n\n“That I shall be unable to depart? Don’t be too sure. I have left some\nvery agreeable people over there.”\n\n“Ah,” said Acton, “but it was to come here, where I am!”\n\n“I didn’t know of your existence. Excuse me for saying anything so rude;\nbut, honestly speaking, I did not. No,” the Baroness pursued, “it was\nprecisely not to see you--such people as you--that I came.”\n\n“Such people as me?” cried Acton.\n\n“I had a sort of longing to come into those natural relations which I\nknew I should find here. Over there I had only, as I may say, artificial\nrelations. Don’t you see the difference?”\n\n“The difference tells against me,” said Acton. “I suppose I am an\nartificial relation.”\n\n“Conventional,” declared the Baroness; “very conventional.”\n\n“Well, there is one way in which the relation of a lady and a gentleman\nmay always become natural,” said Acton.\n\n“You mean by their becoming lovers? That may be natural or not. And at\nany rate,” rejoined Eugenia, _“nous n’en sommes pas là!”_\n\nThey were not, as yet; but a little later, when she began to go with him\nto drive, it might almost have seemed that they were. He came for her\nseveral times, alone, in his high “wagon,” drawn by a pair of charming\nlight-limbed horses. It was different, her having gone with Clifford\nWentworth, who was her cousin, and so much younger. It was not to be\nimagined that she should have a flirtation with Clifford, who was a mere\nshame-faced boy, and whom a large section of Boston society supposed to\nbe “engaged” to Lizzie Acton. Not, indeed, that it was to be conceived\nthat the Baroness was a possible party to any flirtation whatever; for\nshe was undoubtedly a married lady. It was generally known that her\nmatrimonial condition was of the “morganatic” order; but in its natural\naversion to suppose that this meant anything less than absolute wedlock,\nthe conscience of the community took refuge in the belief that it\nimplied something even more.\n\nActon wished her to think highly of American scenery, and he drove her\nto great distances, picking out the prettiest roads and the largest\npoints of view. If we are good when we are contented, Eugenia’s virtues\nshould now certainly have been uppermost; for she found a charm in the\nrapid movement through a wild country, and in a companion who from time\nto time made the vehicle dip, with a motion like a swallow’s flight,\nover roads of primitive construction, and who, as she felt, would do\na great many things that she might ask him. Sometimes, for a couple\nof hours together, there were almost no houses; there were nothing but\nwoods and rivers and lakes and horizons adorned with bright-looking\nmountains. It seemed to the Baroness very wild, as I have said,\nand lovely; but the impression added something to that sense of the\nenlargement of opportunity which had been born of her arrival in the New\nWorld.\n\nOne day--it was late in the afternoon--Acton pulled up his horses on the\ncrest of a hill which commanded a beautiful prospect. He let them stand\na long time to rest, while he sat there and talked with Madame Münster.\nThe prospect was beautiful in spite of there being nothing human within\nsight. There was a wilderness of woods, and the gleam of a distant\nriver, and a glimpse of half the hill-tops in Massachusetts. The road\nhad a wide, grassy margin, on the further side of which there flowed a\ndeep, clear brook; there were wild flowers in the grass, and beside the\nbrook lay the trunk of a fallen tree. Acton waited a while; at last a\nrustic wayfarer came trudging along the road. Acton asked him to hold\nthe horses--a service he consented to render, as a friendly turn to a\nfellow-citizen. Then he invited the Baroness to descend, and the two\nwandered away, across the grass, and sat down on the log beside the\nbrook.\n\n“I imagine it doesn’t remind you of Silberstadt,” said Acton. It was\nthe first time that he had mentioned Silberstadt to her, for particular\nreasons. He knew she had a husband there, and this was disagreeable to\nhim; and, furthermore, it had been repeated to him that this husband\nwished to put her away--a state of affairs to which even indirect\nreference was to be deprecated. It was true, nevertheless, that the\nBaroness herself had often alluded to Silberstadt; and Acton had often\nwondered why her husband wished to get rid of her. It was a curious\nposition for a lady--this being known as a repudiated wife; and it is\nworthy of observation that the Baroness carried it off with exceeding\ngrace and dignity. She had made it felt, from the first, that there were\ntwo sides to the question, and that her own side, when she should choose\nto present it, would be replete with touching interest.\n\n“It does not remind me of the town, of course,” she said, “of the\nsculptured gables and the Gothic churches, of the wonderful Schloss,\nwith its moat and its clustering towers. But it has a little look of\nsome other parts of the principality. One might fancy one’s self among\nthose grand old German forests, those legendary mountains; the sort of\ncountry one sees from the windows at Schreckenstein.”\n\n“What is Schreckenstein?” asked Acton.\n\n“It is a great castle,--the summer residence of the Reigning Prince.”\n\n“Have you ever lived there?”\n\n“I have stayed there,” said the Baroness. Acton was silent; he looked a\nwhile at the uncastled landscape before him. “It is the first time you\nhave ever asked me about Silberstadt,” she said. “I should think you\nwould want to know about my marriage; it must seem to you very strange.”\n\nActon looked at her a moment. “Now you wouldn’t like me to say that!”\n\n“You Americans have such odd ways!” the Baroness declared. “You never\nask anything outright; there seem to be so many things you can’t talk\nabout.”\n\n“We Americans are very polite,” said Acton, whose national consciousness\nhad been complicated by a residence in foreign lands, and who yet\ndisliked to hear Americans abused. “We don’t like to tread upon\npeople’s toes,” he said. “But I should like very much to hear about your\nmarriage. Now tell me how it came about.”\n\n“The Prince fell in love with me,” replied the Baroness simply. “He\npressed his suit very hard. At first he didn’t wish me to marry him;\non the contrary. But on that basis I refused to listen to him. So he\noffered me marriage--in so far as he might. I was young, and I confess\nI was rather flattered. But if it were to be done again now, I certainly\nshould not accept him.”\n\n“How long ago was this?” asked Acton.\n\n“Oh--several years,” said Eugenia. “You should never ask a woman for\ndates.”\n\n“Why, I should think that when a woman was relating history “ Acton\nanswered. “And now he wants to break it off?”\n\n“They want him to make a political marriage. It is his brother’s idea.\nHis brother is very clever.”\n\n“They must be a precious pair!” cried Robert Acton.\n\nThe Baroness gave a little philosophic shrug. “_Que voulez-vous?_ They\nare princes. They think they are treating me very well. Silberstadt is\na perfectly despotic little state, and the Reigning Prince may annul the\nmarriage by a stroke of his pen. But he has promised me, nevertheless,\nnot to do so without my formal consent.”\n\n“And this you have refused?”\n\n“Hitherto. It is an indignity, and I have wished at least to make it\ndifficult for them. But I have a little document in my writing-desk\nwhich I have only to sign and send back to the Prince.”\n\n“Then it will be all over?”\n\nThe Baroness lifted her hand, and dropped it again. “Of course I shall\nkeep my title; at least, I shall be at liberty to keep it if I choose.\nAnd I suppose I shall keep it. One must have a name. And I shall keep my\npension. It is very small--it is wretchedly small; but it is what I live\non.”\n\n“And you have only to sign that paper?” Acton asked.\n\nThe Baroness looked at him a moment. “Do you urge it?”\n\nHe got up slowly, and stood with his hands in his pockets. “What do you\ngain by not doing it?”\n\n“I am supposed to gain this advantage--that if I delay, or temporize,\nthe Prince may come back to me, may make a stand against his brother.\nHe is very fond of me, and his brother has pushed him only little by\nlittle.”\n\n“If he were to come back to you,” said Acton, “would you--would you take\nhim back?”\n\nThe Baroness met his eyes; she colored just a little. Then she rose. “I\nshould have the satisfaction of saying, ‘Now it is my turn. I break with\nyour Serene Highness!’”\n\nThey began to walk toward the carriage. “Well,” said Robert Acton, “it’s\na curious story! How did you make his acquaintance?”\n\n“I was staying with an old lady--an old Countess--in Dresden. She had\nbeen a friend of my father’s. My father was dead; I was very much alone.\nMy brother was wandering about the world in a theatrical troupe.”\n\n“Your brother ought to have stayed with you,” Acton observed, “and kept\nyou from putting your trust in princes.”\n\nThe Baroness was silent a moment, and then, “He did what he could,” she\nsaid. “He sent me money. The old Countess encouraged the Prince; she\nwas even pressing. It seems to me,” Madame Münster added, gently,\n“that--under the circumstances--I behaved very well.”\n\nActon glanced at her, and made the observation--he had made it\nbefore--that a woman looks the prettier for having unfolded her wrongs\nor her sufferings. “Well,” he reflected, audibly, “I should like to see\nyou send his Serene Highness--somewhere!”\n\nMadame Münster stooped and plucked a daisy from the grass. “And not sign\nmy renunciation?”\n\n“Well, I don’t know--I don’t know,” said Acton.\n\n“In one case I should have my revenge; in another case I should have my\nliberty.”\n\nActon gave a little laugh as he helped her into the carriage. “At any\nrate,” he said, “take good care of that paper.”\n\nA couple of days afterward he asked her to come and see his house. The\nvisit had already been proposed, but it had been put off in consequence\nof his mother’s illness. She was a constant invalid, and she had passed\nthese recent years, very patiently, in a great flowered arm-chair at\nher bedroom window. Lately, for some days, she had been unable to see\nanyone; but now she was better, and she sent the Baroness a very civil\nmessage. Acton had wished their visitor to come to dinner; but Madame\nMünster preferred to begin with a simple call. She had reflected that\nif she should go to dinner Mr. Wentworth and his daughters would also\nbe asked, and it had seemed to her that the peculiar character of the\noccasion would be best preserved in a _tête-à-tête_ with her host. Why\nthe occasion should have a peculiar character she explained to no one.\nAs far as anyone could see, it was simply very pleasant. Acton came for\nher and drove her to his door, an operation which was rapidly performed.\nHis house the Baroness mentally pronounced a very good one; more\narticulately, she declared that it was enchanting. It was large and\nsquare and painted brown; it stood in a well-kept shrubbery, and was\napproached, from the gate, by a short drive. It was, moreover, a much\nmore modern dwelling than Mr. Wentworth’s, and was more redundantly\nupholstered and expensively ornamented. The Baroness perceived that her\nentertainer had analyzed material comfort to a sufficiently fine point.\nAnd then he possessed the most delightful _chinoiseries_--trophies of\nhis sojourn in the Celestial Empire: pagodas of ebony and cabinets of\nivory; sculptured monsters, grinning and leering on chimney-pieces,\nin front of beautifully figured hand-screens; porcelain dinner-sets,\ngleaming behind the glass doors of mahogany buffets; large screens,\nin corners, covered with tense silk and embroidered with mandarins and\ndragons. These things were scattered all over the house, and they gave\nEugenia a pretext for a complete domiciliary visit. She liked it, she\nenjoyed it; she thought it a very nice place. It had a mixture of the\nhomely and the liberal, and though it was almost a museum, the large,\nlittle-used rooms were as fresh and clean as a well-kept dairy. Lizzie\nActon told her that she dusted all the pagodas and other curiosities\nevery day with her own hands; and the Baroness answered that she was\nevidently a household fairy. Lizzie had not at all the look of a young\nlady who dusted things; she wore such pretty dresses and had such\ndelicate fingers that it was difficult to imagine her immersed in sordid\ncares. She came to meet Madame Münster on her arrival, but she said\nnothing, or almost nothing, and the Baroness again reflected--she had\nhad occasion to do so before--that American girls had no manners. She\ndisliked this little American girl, and she was quite prepared to learn\nthat she had failed to commend herself to Miss Acton. Lizzie struck\nher as positive and explicit almost to pertness; and the idea of her\ncombining the apparent incongruities of a taste for housework and the\nwearing of fresh, Parisian-looking dresses suggested the possession of a\ndangerous energy. It was a source of irritation to the Baroness that\nin this country it should seem to matter whether a little girl were a\ntrifle less or a trifle more of a nonentity; for Eugenia had hitherto\nbeen conscious of no moral pressure as regards the appreciation of\ndiminutive virgins. It was perhaps an indication of Lizzie’s pertness\nthat she very soon retired and left the Baroness on her brother’s hands.\nActon talked a great deal about his _chinoiseries_; he knew a good deal\nabout porcelain and bric-à-brac. The Baroness, in her progress through\nthe house, made, as it were, a great many stations. She sat down\neverywhere, confessed to being a little tired, and asked about the\nvarious objects with a curious mixture of alertness and inattention. If\nthere had been anyone to say it to she would have declared that she\nwas positively in love with her host; but she could hardly make this\ndeclaration--even in the strictest confidence--to Acton himself. It gave\nher, nevertheless, a pleasure that had some of the charm of unwontedness\nto feel, with that admirable keenness with which she was capable of\nfeeling things, that he had a disposition without any edges; that even\nhis humorous irony always expanded toward the point. One’s impression of\nhis honesty was almost like carrying a bunch of flowers; the perfume was\nmost agreeable, but they were occasionally an inconvenience. One could\ntrust him, at any rate, round all the corners of the world; and, withal,\nhe was not absolutely simple, which would have been excess; he was only\nrelatively simple, which was quite enough for the Baroness.\n\nLizzie reappeared to say that her mother would now be happy to receive\nMadame Münster; and the Baroness followed her to Mrs. Acton’s apartment.\nEugenia reflected, as she went, that it was not the affectation of\nimpertinence that made her dislike this young lady, for on that ground\nshe could easily have beaten her. It was not an aspiration on the girl’s\npart to rivalry, but a kind of laughing, childishly-mocking indifference\nto the results of comparison. Mrs. Acton was an emaciated, sweet-faced\nwoman of five and fifty, sitting with pillows behind her, and looking\nout on a clump of hemlocks. She was very modest, very timid, and very\nill; she made Eugenia feel grateful that she herself was not like\nthat--neither so ill, nor, possibly, so modest. On a chair, beside her,\nlay a volume of Emerson’s Essays. It was a great occasion for poor Mrs.\nActon, in her helpless condition, to be confronted with a clever foreign\nlady, who had more manner than any lady--any dozen ladies--that she had\never seen.\n\n“I have heard a great deal about you,” she said, softly, to the\nBaroness.\n\n“From your son, eh?” Eugenia asked. “He has talked to me immensely of\nyou. Oh, he talks of you as you would like,” the Baroness declared; “as\nsuch a son _must_ talk of such a mother!”\n\nMrs. Acton sat gazing; this was part of Madame Münster’s “manner.” But\nRobert Acton was gazing too, in vivid consciousness that he had barely\nmentioned his mother to their brilliant guest. He never talked of this\nstill maternal presence,--a presence refined to such delicacy that it\nhad almost resolved itself, with him, simply into the subjective emotion\nof gratitude. And Acton rarely talked of his emotions. The Baroness\nturned her smile toward him, and she instantly felt that she had been\nobserved to be fibbing. She had struck a false note. But who were these\npeople to whom such fibbing was not pleasing? If they were annoyed, the\nBaroness was equally so; and after the exchange of a few civil inquiries\nand low-voiced responses she took leave of Mrs. Acton. She begged Robert\nnot to come home with her; she would get into the carriage alone;\nshe preferred that. This was imperious, and she thought he looked\ndisappointed. While she stood before the door with him--the carriage was\nturning in the gravel-walk--this thought restored her serenity.\n\nWhen she had given him her hand in farewell she looked at him a moment.\n“I have almost decided to dispatch that paper,” she said.\n\nHe knew that she alluded to the document that she had called her\nrenunciation; and he assisted her into the carriage without saying\nanything. But just before the vehicle began to move he said, “Well, when\nyou have in fact dispatched it, I hope you will let me know!”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nFelix Young finished Gertrude’s portrait, and he afterwards transferred\nto canvas the features of many members of that circle of which it may\nbe said that he had become for the time the pivot and the centre. I am\nafraid it must be confessed that he was a decidedly flattering painter,\nand that he imparted to his models a romantic grace which seemed easily\nand cheaply acquired by the payment of a hundred dollars to a young man\nwho made “sitting” so entertaining. For Felix was paid for his pictures,\nmaking, as he did, no secret of the fact that in guiding his steps to\nthe Western world affectionate curiosity had gone hand in hand with a\ndesire to better his condition. He took his uncle’s portrait quite as if\nMr. Wentworth had never averted himself from the experiment; and as he\ncompassed his end only by the exercise of gentle violence, it is but\nfair to add that he allowed the old man to give him nothing but his\ntime. He passed his arm into Mr. Wentworth’s one summer morning--very\nfew arms indeed had ever passed into Mr. Wentworth’s--and led him across\nthe garden and along the road into the studio which he had extemporized\nin the little house among the apple trees. The grave gentleman felt\nhimself more and more fascinated by his clever nephew, whose fresh,\ndemonstrative youth seemed a compendium of experiences so strangely\nnumerous. It appeared to him that Felix must know a great deal; he would\nlike to learn what he thought about some of those things as regards\nwhich his own conversation had always been formal, but his knowledge\nvague. Felix had a confident, gayly trenchant way of judging human\nactions which Mr. Wentworth grew little by little to envy; it seemed\nlike criticism made easy. Forming an opinion--say on a person’s\nconduct--was, with Mr. Wentworth, a good deal like fumbling in a lock\nwith a key chosen at hazard. He seemed to himself to go about the world\nwith a big bunch of these ineffectual instruments at his girdle. His\nnephew, on the other hand, with a single turn of the wrist, opened\nany door as adroitly as a horse-thief. He felt obliged to keep up the\nconvention that an uncle is always wiser than a nephew, even if he could\nkeep it up no otherwise than by listening in serious silence to Felix’s\nquick, light, constant discourse. But there came a day when he lapsed\nfrom consistency and almost asked his nephew’s advice.\n\n“Have you ever entertained the idea of settling in the United States?”\n he asked one morning, while Felix brilliantly plied his brush.\n\n“My dear uncle,” said Felix, “excuse me if your question makes me smile\na little. To begin with, I have never entertained an idea. Ideas often\nentertain _me_; but I am afraid I have never seriously made a plan. I\nknow what you are going to say; or rather, I know what you think, for\nI don’t think you will say it--that this is very frivolous and\nloose-minded on my part. So it is; but I am made like that; I take\nthings as they come, and somehow there is always some new thing\nto follow the last. In the second place, I should never propose to\n_settle_. I can’t settle, my dear uncle; I’m not a settler. I know that\nis what strangers are supposed to do here; they always settle. But I\nhaven’t--to answer your question--entertained that idea.”\n\n“You intend to return to Europe and resume your irregular manner of\nlife?” Mr. Wentworth inquired.\n\n“I can’t say I intend. But it’s very likely I shall go back to Europe.\nAfter all, I am a European. I feel that, you know. It will depend a good\ndeal upon my sister. She’s even more of a European than I; here, you\nknow, she’s a picture out of her setting. And as for ‘resuming,’ dear\nuncle, I really have never given up my irregular manner of life. What,\nfor me, could be more irregular than this?”\n\n“Than what?” asked Mr. Wentworth, with his pale gravity.\n\n“Well, than everything! Living in the midst of you, this way; this\ncharming, quiet, serious family life; fraternizing with Charlotte and\nGertrude; calling upon twenty young ladies and going out to walk with\nthem; sitting with you in the evening on the piazza and listening to the\ncrickets, and going to bed at ten o’clock.”\n\n“Your description is very animated,” said Mr. Wentworth; “but I see\nnothing improper in what you describe.”\n\n“Neither do I, dear uncle. It is extremely delightful; I shouldn’t\nlike it if it were improper. I assure you I don’t like improper things;\nthough I dare say you think I do,” Felix went on, painting away.\n\n“I have never accused you of that.”\n\n“Pray don’t,” said Felix, “because, you see, at bottom I am a terrible\nPhilistine.”\n\n“A Philistine?” repeated Mr. Wentworth.\n\n“I mean, as one may say, a plain, God-fearing man.” Mr. Wentworth looked\nat him reservedly, like a mystified sage, and Felix continued, “I trust\nI shall enjoy a venerable and venerated old age. I mean to live long.\nI can hardly call that a plan, perhaps; but it’s a keen desire--a rosy\nvision. I shall be a lively, perhaps even a frivolous old man!”\n\n“It is natural,” said his uncle, sententiously, “that one should desire\nto prolong an agreeable life. We have perhaps a selfish indisposition\nto bring our pleasure to a close. But I presume,” he added, “that you\nexpect to marry.”\n\n“That too, dear uncle, is a hope, a desire, a vision,” said Felix. It\noccurred to him for an instant that this was possibly a preface to the\noffer of the hand of one of Mr. Wentworth’s admirable daughters. But in\nthe name of decent modesty and a proper sense of the hard realities of\nthis world, Felix banished the thought. His uncle was the incarnation\nof benevolence, certainly; but from that to accepting--much more\npostulating--the idea of a union between a young lady with a dowry\npresumptively brilliant and a penniless artist with no prospect of\nfame, there was a very long way. Felix had lately become conscious of\na luxurious preference for the society--if possible unshared with\nothers--of Gertrude Wentworth; but he had relegated this young lady,\nfor the moment, to the coldly brilliant category of unattainable\npossessions. She was not the first woman for whom he had entertained\nan unpractical admiration. He had been in love with duchesses and\ncountesses, and he had made, once or twice, a perilously near approach\nto cynicism in declaring that the disinterestedness of women had been\noverrated. On the whole, he had tempered audacity with modesty; and\nit is but fair to him now to say explicitly that he would have been\nincapable of taking advantage of his present large allowance of\nfamiliarity to make love to the younger of his handsome cousins. Felix\nhad grown up among traditions in the light of which such a proceeding\nlooked like a grievous breach of hospitality. I have said that he was\nalways happy, and it may be counted among the present sources of his\nhappiness that he had as regards this matter of his relations with\nGertrude a deliciously good conscience. His own deportment seemed to\nhim suffused with the beauty of virtue--a form of beauty that he admired\nwith the same vivacity with which he admired all other forms.\n\n“I think that if you marry,” said Mr. Wentworth presently, “it will\nconduce to your happiness.”\n\n_“Sicurissimo!”_ Felix exclaimed; and then, arresting his brush, he\nlooked at his uncle with a smile. “There is something I feel tempted to\nsay to you. May I risk it?”\n\nMr. Wentworth drew himself up a little. “I am very safe; I don’t repeat\nthings.” But he hoped Felix would not risk too much.\n\nFelix was laughing at his answer.\n\n“It’s odd to hear you telling me how to be happy. I don’t think you know\nyourself, dear uncle. Now, does that sound brutal?”\n\nThe old man was silent a moment, and then, with a dry dignity that\nsuddenly touched his nephew: “We may sometimes point out a road we are\nunable to follow.”\n\n“Ah, don’t tell me you have had any sorrows,” Felix rejoined. “I didn’t\nsuppose it, and I didn’t mean to allude to them. I simply meant that you\nall don’t amuse yourselves.”\n\n“Amuse ourselves? We are not children.”\n\n“Precisely not! You have reached the proper age. I was saying that the\nother day to Gertrude,” Felix added. “I hope it was not indiscreet.”\n\n“If it was,” said Mr. Wentworth, with a keener irony than Felix would\nhave thought him capable of, “it was but your way of amusing yourself. I\nam afraid you have never had a trouble.”\n\n“Oh, yes, I have!” Felix declared, with some spirit; “before I knew\nbetter. But you don’t catch me at it again.”\n\nMr. Wentworth maintained for a while a silence more expressive than a\ndeep-drawn sigh. “You have no children,” he said at last.\n\n“Don’t tell me,” Felix exclaimed, “that your charming young people are a\nsource of grief to you!”\n\n“I don’t speak of Charlotte.” And then, after a pause, Mr. Wentworth\ncontinued, “I don’t speak of Gertrude. But I feel considerable anxiety\nabout Clifford. I will tell you another time.”\n\nThe next time he gave Felix a sitting his nephew reminded him that he\nhad taken him into his confidence. “How is Clifford today?” Felix\nasked. “He has always seemed to me a young man of remarkable discretion.\nIndeed, he is only too discreet; he seems on his guard against me--as\nif he thought me rather light company. The other day he told his\nsister--Gertrude repeated it to me--that I was always laughing at him.\nIf I laugh it is simply from the impulse to try and inspire him with\nconfidence. That is the only way I have.”\n\n“Clifford’s situation is no laughing matter,” said Mr. Wentworth. “It is\nvery peculiar, as I suppose you have guessed.”\n\n“Ah, you mean his love affair with his cousin?”\n\nMr. Wentworth stared, blushing a little. “I mean his absence from\ncollege. He has been suspended. We have decided not to speak of it\nunless we are asked.”\n\n“Suspended?” Felix repeated.\n\n“He has been requested by the Harvard authorities to absent himself for\nsix months. Meanwhile he is studying with Mr. Brand. We think Mr. Brand\nwill help him; at least we hope so.”\n\n“What befell him at college?” Felix asked. “He was too fond of pleasure?\nMr. Brand certainly will not teach him any of those secrets!”\n\n“He was too fond of something of which he should not have been fond. I\nsuppose it is considered a pleasure.”\n\nFelix gave his light laugh. “My dear uncle, is there any doubt about its\nbeing a pleasure? _C’est de son âge_, as they say in France.”\n\n“I should have said rather it was a vice of later life--of disappointed\nold age.”\n\nFelix glanced at his uncle, with his lifted eyebrows, and then, “Of what\nare you speaking?” he demanded, smiling.\n\n“Of the situation in which Clifford was found.”\n\n“Ah, he was found--he was caught?”\n\n“Necessarily, he was caught. He couldn’t walk; he staggered.”\n\n“Oh,” said Felix, “he drinks! I rather suspected that, from something I\nobserved the first day I came here. I quite agree with you that it is a\nlow taste. It’s not a vice for a gentleman. He ought to give it up.”\n\n“We hope for a good deal from Mr. Brand’s influence,” Mr. Wentworth went\non. “He has talked to him from the first. And he never touches anything\nhimself.”\n\n“I will talk to him--I will talk to him!” Felix declared, gayly.\n\n“What will you say to him?” asked his uncle, with some apprehension.\n\nFelix for some moments answered nothing. “Do you mean to marry him to\nhis cousin?” he asked at last.\n\n“Marry him?” echoed Mr. Wentworth. “I shouldn’t think his cousin would\nwant to marry him.”\n\n“You have no understanding, then, with Mrs. Acton?”\n\nMr. Wentworth stared, almost blankly. “I have never discussed such\nsubjects with her.”\n\n“I should think it might be time,” said Felix. “Lizzie Acton is\nadmirably pretty, and if Clifford is dangerous....”\n\n“They are not engaged,” said Mr. Wentworth. “I have no reason to suppose\nthey are engaged.”\n\n_“Par exemple!”_ cried Felix. “A clandestine engagement? Trust me,\nClifford, as I say, is a charming boy. He is incapable of that. Lizzie\nActon, then, would not be jealous of another woman.”\n\n“I certainly hope not,” said the old man, with a vague sense of jealousy\nbeing an even lower vice than a love of liquor.\n\n“The best thing for Clifford, then,” Felix propounded, “is to become\ninterested in some clever, charming woman.” And he paused in his\npainting, and, with his elbows on his knees, looked with bright\ncommunicativeness at his uncle. “You see, I believe greatly in the\ninfluence of women. Living with women helps to make a man a gentleman.\nIt is very true Clifford has his sisters, who are so charming. But there\nshould be a different sentiment in play from the fraternal, you know. He\nhas Lizzie Acton; but she, perhaps, is rather immature.”\n\n“I suspect Lizzie has talked to him, reasoned with him,” said Mr.\nWentworth.\n\n“On the impropriety of getting tipsy--on the beauty of temperance? That\nis dreary work for a pretty young girl. No,” Felix continued; “Clifford\nought to frequent some agreeable woman, who, without ever mentioning\nsuch unsavory subjects, would give him a sense of its being very\nridiculous to be fuddled. If he could fall in love with her a little, so\nmuch the better. The thing would operate as a cure.”\n\n“Well, now, what lady should you suggest?” asked Mr. Wentworth.\n\n“There is a clever woman under your hand. My sister.”\n\n“Your sister--under my hand?” Mr. Wentworth repeated.\n\n“Say a word to Clifford. Tell him to be bold. He is well disposed\nalready; he has invited her two or three times to drive. But I don’t\nthink he comes to see her. Give him a hint to come--to come often.\nHe will sit there of an afternoon, and they will talk. It will do him\ngood.”\n\nMr. Wentworth meditated. “You think she will exercise a helpful\ninfluence?”\n\n“She will exercise a civilizing--I may call it a sobering--influence. A\ncharming, clever, witty woman always does--especially if she is a little\nof a coquette. My dear uncle, the society of such women has been half\nmy education. If Clifford is suspended, as you say, from college, let\nEugenia be his preceptress.”\n\nMr. Wentworth continued thoughtful. “You think Eugenia is a coquette?”\n he asked.\n\n“What pretty woman is not?” Felix demanded in turn. But this, for Mr.\nWentworth, could at the best have been no answer, for he did not think\nhis niece pretty. “With Clifford,” the young man pursued, “Eugenia will\nsimply be enough of a coquette to be a little ironical. That’s what\nhe needs. So you recommend him to be nice with her, you know. The\nsuggestion will come best from you.”\n\n“Do I understand,” asked the old man, “that I am to suggest to my son to\nmake a--a profession of--of affection to Madame Münster?”\n\n“Yes, yes--a profession!” cried Felix sympathetically.\n\n“But, as I understand it, Madame Münster is a married woman.”\n\n“Ah,” said Felix, smiling, “of course she can’t marry him. But she will\ndo what she can.”\n\nMr. Wentworth sat for some time with his eyes on the floor; at last he\ngot up. “I don’t think,” he said, “that I can undertake to recommend my\nson any such course.” And without meeting Felix’s surprised glance he\nbroke off his sitting, which was not resumed for a fortnight.\n\nFelix was very fond of the little lake which occupied so many of Mr.\nWentworth’s numerous acres, and of a remarkable pine grove which lay\nupon the further side of it, planted upon a steep embankment and haunted\nby the summer breeze. The murmur of the air in the far off tree-tops\nhad a strange distinctness; it was almost articulate. One afternoon\nthe young man came out of his painting-room and passed the open door of\nEugenia’s little salon. Within, in the cool dimness, he saw his sister,\ndressed in white, buried in her arm-chair, and holding to her face an\nimmense bouquet. Opposite to her sat Clifford Wentworth, twirling his\nhat. He had evidently just presented the bouquet to the Baroness, whose\nfine eyes, as she glanced at him over the big roses and geraniums, wore\na conversational smile. Felix, standing on the threshold of the cottage,\nhesitated for a moment as to whether he should retrace his steps and\nenter the parlor. Then he went his way and passed into Mr. Wentworth’s\ngarden. That civilizing process to which he had suggested that Clifford\nshould be subjected appeared to have come on of itself. Felix was very\nsure, at least, that Mr. Wentworth had not adopted his ingenious device\nfor stimulating the young man’s aesthetic consciousness. “Doubtless\nhe supposes,” he said to himself, after the conversation that has been\nnarrated, “that I desire, out of fraternal benevolence, to procure for\nEugenia the amusement of a flirtation--or, as he probably calls it, an\nintrigue--with the too susceptible Clifford. It must be admitted--and\nI have noticed it before--that nothing exceeds the license occasionally\ntaken by the imagination of very rigid people.” Felix, on his own side,\nhad of course said nothing to Clifford; but he had observed to Eugenia\nthat Mr. Wentworth was much mortified at his son’s low tastes. “We ought\nto do something to help them, after all their kindness to us,” he had\nadded. “Encourage Clifford to come and see you, and inspire him with a\ntaste for conversation. That will supplant the other, which only comes\nfrom his puerility, from his not taking his position in the world--that\nof a rich young man of ancient stock--seriously enough. Make him\na little more serious. Even if he makes love to you it is no great\nmatter.”\n\n“I am to offer myself as a superior form of intoxication--a substitute\nfor a brandy bottle, eh?” asked the Baroness. “Truly, in this country\none comes to strange uses.”\n\nBut she had not positively declined to undertake Clifford’s higher\neducation, and Felix, who had not thought of the matter again, being\nhaunted with visions of more personal profit, now reflected that the\nwork of redemption had fairly begun. The idea in prospect had seemed\nof the happiest, but in operation it made him a trifle uneasy. “What if\nEugenia--what if Eugenia”--he asked himself softly; the question dying\naway in his sense of Eugenia’s undetermined capacity. But before Felix\nhad time either to accept or to reject its admonition, even in this\nvague form, he saw Robert Acton turn out of Mr. Wentworth’s enclosure,\nby a distant gate, and come toward the cottage in the orchard. Acton\nhad evidently walked from his own house along a shady by-way and was\nintending to pay a visit to Madame Münster. Felix watched him a moment;\nthen he turned away. Acton could be left to play the part of Providence\nand interrupt--if interruption were needed--Clifford’s entanglement with\nEugenia.\n\nFelix passed through the garden toward the house and toward a postern\ngate which opened upon a path leading across the fields, beside a little\nwood, to the lake. He stopped and looked up at the house; his eyes\nrested more particularly upon a certain open window, on the shady side.\nPresently Gertrude appeared there, looking out into the summer light. He\ntook off his hat to her and bade her good-day; he remarked that he was\ngoing to row across the pond, and begged that she would do him the\nhonor to accompany him. She looked at him a moment; then, without saying\nanything, she turned away. But she soon reappeared below in one of those\nquaint and charming Leghorn hats, tied with white satin bows, that were\nworn at that period; she also carried a green parasol. She went with\nhim to the edge of the lake, where a couple of boats were always moored;\nthey got into one of them, and Felix, with gentle strokes, propelled it\nto the opposite shore. The day was the perfection of summer weather;\nthe little lake was the color of sunshine; the plash of the oars was the\nonly sound, and they found themselves listening to it. They disembarked,\nand, by a winding path, ascended the pine-crested mound which overlooked\nthe water, whose white expanse glittered between the trees. The place\nwas delightfully cool, and had the added charm that--in the softly\nsounding pine boughs--you seemed to hear the coolness as well as\nfeel it. Felix and Gertrude sat down on the rust-colored carpet of\npine-needles and talked of many things. Felix spoke at last, in the\ncourse of talk, of his going away; it was the first time he had alluded\nto it.\n\n“You are going away?” said Gertrude, looking at him.\n\n“Some day--when the leaves begin to fall. You know I can’t stay\nforever.”\n\nGertrude transferred her eyes to the outer prospect, and then, after a\npause, she said, “I shall never see you again.”\n\n“Why not?” asked Felix. “We shall probably both survive my departure.”\n\nBut Gertrude only repeated, “I shall never see you again. I shall never\nhear of you,” she went on. “I shall know nothing about you. I knew\nnothing about you before, and it will be the same again.”\n\n“I knew nothing about you then, unfortunately,” said Felix. “But now I\nshall write to you.”\n\n“Don’t write to me. I shall not answer you,” Gertrude declared.\n\n“I should of course burn your letters,” said Felix.\n\nGertrude looked at him again. “Burn my letters? You sometimes say\nstrange things.”\n\n“They are not strange in themselves,” the young man answered. “They are\nonly strange as said to you. You will come to Europe.”\n\n“With whom shall I come?” She asked this question simply; she was very\nmuch in earnest. Felix was interested in her earnestness; for some\nmoments he hesitated. “You can’t tell me that,” she pursued. “You can’t\nsay that I shall go with my father and my sister; you don’t believe\nthat.”\n\n“I shall keep your letters,” said Felix, presently, for all answer.\n\n“I never write. I don’t know how to write.” Gertrude, for some time,\nsaid nothing more; and her companion, as he looked at her, wished it had\nnot been “disloyal” to make love to the daughter of an old gentleman who\nhad offered one hospitality. The afternoon waned; the shadows stretched\nthemselves; and the light grew deeper in the western sky. Two persons\nappeared on the opposite side of the lake, coming from the house and\ncrossing the meadow. “It is Charlotte and Mr. Brand,” said Gertrude.\n“They are coming over here.” But Charlotte and Mr. Brand only came down\nto the edge of the water, and stood there, looking across; they made no\nmotion to enter the boat that Felix had left at the mooring-place. Felix\nwaved his hat to them; it was too far to call. They made no visible\nresponse, and they presently turned away and walked along the shore.\n\n“Mr. Brand is not demonstrative,” said Felix. “He is never demonstrative\nto me. He sits silent, with his chin in his hand, looking at me.\nSometimes he looks away. Your father tells me he is so eloquent; and I\nshould like to hear him talk. He looks like such a noble young man.\nBut with me he will never talk. And yet I am so fond of listening to\nbrilliant imagery!”\n\n“He is very eloquent,” said Gertrude; “but he has no brilliant imagery.\nI have heard him talk a great deal. I knew that when they saw us they\nwould not come over here.”\n\n“Ah, he is making _la cour_, as they say, to your sister? They desire to\nbe alone?”\n\n“No,” said Gertrude, gravely, “they have no such reason as that for\nbeing alone.”\n\n“But why doesn’t he make _la cour_ to Charlotte?” Felix inquired. “She\nis so pretty, so gentle, so good.”\n\nGertrude glanced at him, and then she looked at the distantly-seen\ncouple they were discussing. Mr. Brand and Charlotte were walking side\nby side. They might have been a pair of lovers, and yet they might not.\n“They think I should not be here,” said Gertrude.\n\n“With me? I thought you didn’t have those ideas.”\n\n“You don’t understand. There are a great many things you don’t\nunderstand.”\n\n“I understand my stupidity. But why, then, do not Charlotte and Mr.\nBrand, who, as an elder sister and a clergyman, are free to walk about\ntogether, come over and make me wiser by breaking up the unlawful\ninterview into which I have lured you?”\n\n“That is the last thing they would do,” said Gertrude.\n\nFelix stared at her a moment, with his lifted eyebrows. _“Je n’y\ncomprends rien!”_ he exclaimed; then his eyes followed for a while the\nretreating figures of this critical pair. “You may say what you please,”\n he declared; “it is evident to me that your sister is not indifferent\nto her clever companion. It is agreeable to her to be walking there with\nhim. I can see that from here.” And in the excitement of observation\nFelix rose to his feet.\n\nGertrude rose also, but she made no attempt to emulate her companion’s\ndiscovery; she looked rather in another direction. Felix’s words had\nstruck her; but a certain delicacy checked her. “She is certainly not\nindifferent to Mr. Brand; she has the highest opinion of him.”\n\n“One can see it--one can see it,” said Felix, in a tone of amused\ncontemplation, with his head on one side. Gertrude turned her back to\nthe opposite shore; it was disagreeable to her to look, but she hoped\nFelix would say something more. “Ah, they have wandered away into the\nwood,” he added.\n\nGertrude turned round again. “She is _not_ in love with him,” she said;\nit seemed her duty to say that.\n\n“Then he is in love with her; or if he is not, he ought to be. She is\nsuch a perfect little woman of her kind. She reminds me of a pair of\nold-fashioned silver sugar-tongs; you know I am very fond of sugar. And\nshe is very nice with Mr. Brand; I have noticed that; very gentle and\ngracious.”\n\nGertrude reflected a moment. Then she took a great resolution. “She\nwants him to marry me,” she said. “So of course she is nice.”\n\nFelix’s eyebrows rose higher than ever. “To marry you! Ah, ah, this is\ninteresting. And you think one must be very nice with a man to induce\nhim to do that?”\n\nGertrude had turned a little pale, but she went on, “Mr. Brand wants it\nhimself.”\n\nFelix folded his arms and stood looking at her. “I see--I see,” he said\nquickly. “Why did you never tell me this before?”\n\n“It is disagreeable to me to speak of it even now. I wished simply to\nexplain to you about Charlotte.”\n\n“You don’t wish to marry Mr. Brand, then?”\n\n“No,” said Gertrude, gravely.\n\n“And does your father wish it?”\n\n“Very much.”\n\n“And you don’t like him--you have refused him?”\n\n“I don’t wish to marry him.”\n\n“Your father and sister think you ought to, eh?”\n\n“It is a long story,” said Gertrude. “They think there are good reasons.\nI can’t explain it. They think I have obligations, and that I have\nencouraged him.”\n\nFelix smiled at her, as if she had been telling him an amusing story\nabout someone else. “I can’t tell you how this interests me,” he said.\n“Now you don’t recognize these reasons--these obligations?”\n\n“I am not sure; it is not easy.” And she picked up her parasol and\nturned away, as if to descend the slope.\n\n“Tell me this,” Felix went on, going with her: “are you likely to give\nin--to let them persuade you?”\n\nGertrude looked at him with the serious face that she had constantly\nworn, in opposition to his almost eager smile. “I shall never marry Mr.\nBrand,” she said.\n\n“I see!” Felix rejoined. And they slowly descended the hill together,\nsaying nothing till they reached the margin of the pond. “It is your own\naffair,” he then resumed; “but do you know, I am not altogether glad? If\nit were settled that you were to marry Mr. Brand I should take a certain\ncomfort in the arrangement. I should feel more free. I have no right\nto make love to you myself, eh?” And he paused, lightly pressing his\nargument upon her.\n\n“None whatever,” replied Gertrude quickly--too quickly.\n\n“Your father would never hear of it; I haven’t a penny. Mr. Brand, of\ncourse, has property of his own, eh?”\n\n“I believe he has some property; but that has nothing to do with it.”\n\n“With you, of course not; but with your father and sister it must have.\nSo, as I say, if this were settled, I should feel more at liberty.”\n\n“More at liberty?” Gertrude repeated. “Please unfasten the boat.”\n\nFelix untwisted the rope and stood holding it. “I should be able to say\nthings to you that I can’t give myself the pleasure of saying now,” he\nwent on. “I could tell you how much I admire you, without seeming to\npretend to that which I have no right to pretend to. I should make\nviolent love to you,” he added, laughing, “if I thought you were so\nplaced as not to be offended by it.”\n\n“You mean if I were engaged to another man? That is strange reasoning!”\n Gertrude exclaimed.\n\n“In that case you would not take me seriously.”\n\n“I take everyone seriously,” said Gertrude. And without his help she\nstepped lightly into the boat.\n\nFelix took up the oars and sent it forward. “Ah, this is what you have\nbeen thinking about? It seemed to me you had something on your mind.\nI wish very much,” he added, “that you would tell me some of these\nso-called reasons--these obligations.”\n\n“They are not real reasons--good reasons,” said Gertrude, looking at the\npink and yellow gleams in the water.\n\n“I can understand that! Because a handsome girl has had a spark of\ncoquetry, that is no reason.”\n\n“If you mean me, it’s not that. I have not done that.”\n\n“It is something that troubles you, at any rate,” said Felix.\n\n“Not so much as it used to,” Gertrude rejoined.\n\nHe looked at her, smiling always. “That is not saying much, eh?” But she\nonly rested her eyes, very gravely, on the lighted water. She seemed to\nhim to be trying to hide the signs of the trouble of which she had just\ntold him. Felix felt, at all times, much the same impulse to dissipate\nvisible melancholy that a good housewife feels to brush away dust. There\nwas something he wished to brush away now; suddenly he stopped rowing\nand poised his oars. “Why should Mr. Brand have addressed himself to\nyou, and not to your sister?” he asked. “I am sure she would listen to\nhim.”\n\nGertrude, in her family, was thought capable of a good deal of levity;\nbut her levity had never gone so far as this. It moved her greatly,\nhowever, to hear Felix say that he was sure of something; so that,\nraising her eyes toward him, she tried intently, for some moments, to\nconjure up this wonderful image of a love-affair between her own sister\nand her own suitor. We know that Gertrude had an imaginative mind; so\nthat it is not impossible that this effort should have been partially\nsuccessful. But she only murmured, “Ah, Felix! ah, Felix!”\n\n“Why shouldn’t they marry? Try and make them marry!” cried Felix.\n\n“Try and make them?”\n\n“Turn the tables on them. Then they will leave you alone. I will help\nyou as far as I can.”\n\nGertrude’s heart began to beat; she was greatly excited; she had never\nhad anything so interesting proposed to her before. Felix had begun to\nrow again, and he now sent the boat home with long strokes. “I believe\nshe _does_ care for him!” said Gertrude, after they had disembarked.\n\n“Of course she does, and we will marry them off. It will make them\nhappy; it will make everyone happy. We shall have a wedding and I will\nwrite an epithalamium.”\n\n“It seems as if it would make _me_ happy,” said Gertrude.\n\n“To get rid of Mr. Brand, eh? To recover your liberty?”\n\nGertrude walked on. “To see my sister married to so good a man.”\n\nFelix gave his light laugh. “You always put things on those grounds; you\nwill never say anything for yourself. You are all so afraid, here, of\nbeing selfish. I don’t think you know how,” he went on. “Let me show\nyou! It will make me happy for myself, and for just the reverse of what\nI told you a while ago. After that, when I make love to you, you will\nhave to think I mean it.”\n\n“I shall never think you mean anything,” said Gertrude. “You are too\nfantastic.”\n\n“Ah,” cried Felix, “that’s a license to say everything! Gertrude, I\nadore you!”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nCharlotte and Mr. Brand had not returned when they reached the house;\nbut the Baroness had come to tea, and Robert Acton also, who now\nregularly asked for a place at this generous repast or made his\nappearance later in the evening. Clifford Wentworth, with his juvenile\ngrowl, remarked upon it.\n\n“You are always coming to tea nowadays, Robert,” he said. “I should\nthink you had drunk enough tea in China.”\n\n“Since when is Mr. Acton more frequent?” asked the Baroness.\n\n“Since you came,” said Clifford. “It seems as if you were a kind of\nattraction.”\n\n“I suppose I am a curiosity,” said the Baroness. “Give me time and I\nwill make you a salon.”\n\n“It would fall to pieces after you go!” exclaimed Acton.\n\n“Don’t talk about her going, in that familiar way,” Clifford said. “It\nmakes me feel gloomy.”\n\nMr. Wentworth glanced at his son, and taking note of these words,\nwondered if Felix had been teaching him, according to the programme he\nhad sketched out, to make love to the wife of a German prince.\n\nCharlotte came in late with Mr. Brand; but Gertrude, to whom, at least,\nFelix had taught something, looked in vain, in her face, for the traces\nof a guilty passion. Mr. Brand sat down by Gertrude, and she presently\nasked him why they had not crossed the pond to join Felix and herself.\n\n“It is cruel of you to ask me that,” he answered, very softly. He had a\nlarge morsel of cake before him; but he fingered it without eating it.\n“I sometimes think you are growing cruel,” he added.\n\nGertrude said nothing; she was afraid to speak. There was a kind of rage\nin her heart; she felt as if she could easily persuade herself that she\nwas persecuted. She said to herself that it was quite right that she\nshould not allow him to make her believe she was wrong. She thought\nof what Felix had said to her; she wished indeed Mr. Brand would marry\nCharlotte. She looked away from him and spoke no more. Mr. Brand\nended by eating his cake, while Felix sat opposite, describing to\nMr. Wentworth the students’ duels at Heidelberg. After tea they all\ndispersed themselves, as usual, upon the piazza and in the garden; and\nMr. Brand drew near to Gertrude again.\n\n“I didn’t come to you this afternoon because you were not alone,” he\nbegan; “because you were with a newer friend.”\n\n“Felix? He is an old friend by this time.”\n\nMr. Brand looked at the ground for some moments. “I thought I was\nprepared to hear you speak in that way,” he resumed. “But I find it very\npainful.”\n\n“I don’t see what else I can say,” said Gertrude.\n\nMr. Brand walked beside her for a while in silence; Gertrude wished he\nwould go away. “He is certainly very accomplished. But I think I ought\nto advise you.”\n\n“To advise me?”\n\n“I think I know your nature.”\n\n“I think you don’t,” said Gertrude, with a soft laugh.\n\n“You make yourself out worse than you are--to please him,” Mr. Brand\nsaid, gently.\n\n“Worse--to please him? What do you mean?” asked Gertrude, stopping.\n\nMr. Brand stopped also, and with the same soft straight-forwardness, “He\ndoesn’t care for the things you care for--the great questions of life.”\n\nGertrude, with her eyes on his, shook her head. “I don’t care for the\ngreat questions of life. They are much beyond me.”\n\n“There was a time when you didn’t say that,” said Mr. Brand.\n\n“Oh,” rejoined Gertrude, “I think you made me talk a great deal of\nnonsense. And it depends,” she added, “upon what you call the great\nquestions of life. There are some things I care for.”\n\n“Are they the things you talk about with your cousin?”\n\n“You should not say things to me against my cousin, Mr. Brand,” said\nGertrude. “That is dishonorable.”\n\nHe listened to this respectfully; then he answered, with a little\nvibration of the voice, “I should be very sorry to do anything\ndishonorable. But I don’t see why it is dishonorable to say that your\ncousin is frivolous.”\n\n“Go and say it to himself!”\n\n“I think he would admit it,” said Mr. Brand. “That is the tone he would\ntake. He would not be ashamed of it.”\n\n“Then I am not ashamed of it!” Gertrude declared. “That is probably what\nI like him for. I am frivolous myself.”\n\n“You are trying, as I said just now, to lower yourself.”\n\n“I am trying for once to be natural!” cried Gertrude passionately. “I\nhave been pretending, all my life; I have been dishonest; it is you that\nhave made me so!” Mr. Brand stood gazing at her, and she went on, “Why\nshouldn’t I be frivolous, if I want? One has a right to be frivolous, if\nit’s one’s nature. No, I don’t care for the great questions. I care for\npleasure--for amusement. Perhaps I am fond of wicked things; it is very\npossible!”\n\nMr. Brand remained staring; he was even a little pale, as if he had been\nfrightened. “I don’t think you know what you are saying!” he exclaimed.\n\n“Perhaps not. Perhaps I am talking nonsense. But it is only with you\nthat I talk nonsense. I never do so with my cousin.”\n\n“I will speak to you again, when you are less excited,” said Mr. Brand.\n\n“I am always excited when you speak to me. I must tell you that--even if\nit prevents you altogether, in future. Your speaking to me irritates me.\nWith my cousin it is very different. That seems quiet and natural.”\n\nHe looked at her, and then he looked away, with a kind of helpless\ndistress, at the dusky garden and the faint summer stars. After which,\nsuddenly turning back, “Gertrude, Gertrude!” he softly groaned. “Am I\nreally losing you?”\n\nShe was touched--she was pained; but it had already occurred to her that\nshe might do something better than say so. It would not have alleviated\nher companion’s distress to perceive, just then, whence she had\nsympathetically borrowed this ingenuity. “I am not sorry for you,”\n Gertrude said; “for in paying so much attention to me you are following\na shadow--you are wasting something precious. There is something else\nyou might have that you don’t look at--something better than I am. That\nis a reality!” And then, with intention, she looked at him and tried\nto smile a little. He thought this smile of hers very strange; but she\nturned away and left him.\n\nShe wandered about alone in the garden wondering what Mr. Brand would\nmake of her words, which it had been a singular pleasure for her to\nutter. Shortly after, passing in front of the house, she saw at a\ndistance two persons standing near the garden gate. It was Mr. Brand\ngoing away and bidding good-night to Charlotte, who had walked down with\nhim from the house. Gertrude saw that the parting was prolonged. Then\nshe turned her back upon it. She had not gone very far, however, when\nshe heard her sister slowly following her. She neither turned round nor\nwaited for her; she knew what Charlotte was going to say. Charlotte, who\nat last overtook her, in fact presently began; she had passed her arm\ninto Gertrude’s.\n\n“Will you listen to me, dear, if I say something very particular?”\n\n“I know what you are going to say,” said Gertrude. “Mr. Brand feels very\nbadly.”\n\n“Oh, Gertrude, how can you treat him so?” Charlotte demanded. And as her\nsister made no answer she added, “After all he has done for you!”\n\n“What has he done for me?”\n\n“I wonder you can ask, Gertrude. He has helped you so. You told me so\nyourself, a great many times. You told me that he helped you to struggle\nwith your--your peculiarities. You told me that he had taught you how to\ngovern your temper.”\n\nFor a moment Gertrude said nothing. Then, “Was my temper very bad?” she\nasked.\n\n“I am not accusing you, Gertrude,” said Charlotte.\n\n“What are you doing, then?” her sister demanded, with a short laugh.\n\n“I am pleading for Mr. Brand--reminding you of all you owe him.”\n\n“I have given it all back,” said Gertrude, still with her little laugh.\n“He can take back the virtue he imparted! I want to be wicked again.”\n\nHer sister made her stop in the path, and fixed upon her, in the\ndarkness, a sweet, reproachful gaze. “If you talk this way I shall\nalmost believe it. Think of all we owe Mr. Brand. Think of how he has\nalways expected something of you. Think how much he has been to us.\nThink of his beautiful influence upon Clifford.”\n\n“He is very good,” said Gertrude, looking at her sister. “I know he is\nvery good. But he shouldn’t speak against Felix.”\n\n“Felix is good,” Charlotte answered, softly but promptly. “Felix is very\nwonderful. Only he is so different. Mr. Brand is much nearer to us. I\nshould never think of going to Felix with a trouble--with a question.\nMr. Brand is much more to us, Gertrude.”\n\n“He is very--very good,” Gertrude repeated. “He is more to you; yes,\nmuch more. Charlotte,” she added suddenly, “you are in love with him!”\n\n“Oh, Gertrude!” cried poor Charlotte; and her sister saw her blushing in\nthe darkness.\n\nGertrude put her arm round her. “I wish he would marry you!” she went\non.\n\nCharlotte shook herself free. “You must not say such things!” she\nexclaimed, beneath her breath.\n\n“You like him more than you say, and he likes you more than he knows.”\n\n“This is very cruel of you!” Charlotte Wentworth murmured.\n\nBut if it was cruel Gertrude continued pitiless. “Not if it’s true,” she\nanswered. “I wish he would marry you.”\n\n“Please don’t say that.”\n\n“I mean to tell him so!” said Gertrude.\n\n“Oh, Gertrude, Gertrude!” her sister almost moaned.\n\n“Yes, if he speaks to me again about myself. I will say, ‘Why don’t you\nmarry Charlotte? She’s a thousand times better than I.’”\n\n“You _are_ wicked; you _are_ changed!” cried her sister.\n\n“If you don’t like it you can prevent it,” said Gertrude. “You can\nprevent it by keeping him from speaking to me!” And with this she walked\naway, very conscious of what she had done; measuring it and finding a\ncertain joy and a quickened sense of freedom in it.\n\nMr. Wentworth was rather wide of the mark in suspecting that Clifford\nhad begun to pay unscrupulous compliments to his brilliant cousin; for\nthe young man had really more scruples than he received credit for in\nhis family. He had a certain transparent shamefacedness which was\nin itself a proof that he was not at his ease in dissipation. His\ncollegiate peccadilloes had aroused a domestic murmur as disagreeable\nto the young man as the creaking of his boots would have been to a\nhouse-breaker. Only, as the house-breaker would have simplified matters\nby removing his _chaussures_, it had seemed to Clifford that the\nshortest cut to comfortable relations with people--relations which\nshould make him cease to think that when they spoke to him they meant\nsomething improving--was to renounce all ambition toward a nefarious\ndevelopment. And, in fact, Clifford’s ambition took the most commendable\nform. He thought of himself in the future as the well-known and\nmuch-liked Mr. Wentworth, of Boston, who should, in the natural course\nof prosperity, have married his pretty cousin, Lizzie Acton; should live\nin a wide-fronted house, in view of the Common; and should drive, behind\na light wagon, over the damp autumn roads, a pair of beautifully matched\nsorrel horses. Clifford’s vision of the coming years was very simple;\nits most definite features were this element of familiar matrimony and\nthe duplication of his resources for trotting. He had not yet asked his\ncousin to marry him; but he meant to do so as soon as he had taken his\ndegree. Lizzie was serenely conscious of his intention, and she had made\nup her mind that he would improve. Her brother, who was very fond of\nthis light, quick, competent little Lizzie, saw on his side no reason to\ninterpose. It seemed to him a graceful social law that Clifford and his\nsister should become engaged; he himself was not engaged, but everyone\nelse, fortunately, was not such a fool as he. He was fond of Clifford,\nas well, and had his own way--of which it must be confessed he was a\nlittle ashamed--of looking at those aberrations which had led to the\nyoung man’s compulsory retirement from the neighboring seat of learning.\nActon had seen the world, as he said to himself; he had been to China\nand had knocked about among men. He had learned the essential difference\nbetween a nice young fellow and a mean young fellow, and was satisfied\nthat there was no harm in Clifford. He believed--although it must be\nadded that he had not quite the courage to declare it--in the doctrine\nof wild oats, and thought it a useful preventive of superfluous fears.\nIf Mr. Wentworth and Charlotte and Mr. Brand would only apply it in\nClifford’s case, they would be happier; and Acton thought it a pity\nthey should not be happier. They took the boy’s misdemeanors too much to\nheart; they talked to him too solemnly; they frightened and bewildered\nhim. Of course there was the great standard of morality, which forbade\nthat a man should get tipsy, play at billiards for money, or cultivate\nhis sensual consciousness; but what fear was there that poor Clifford\nwas going to run a tilt at any great standard? It had, however, never\noccurred to Acton to dedicate the Baroness Münster to the redemption of\na refractory collegian. The instrument, here, would have seemed to\nhim quite too complex for the operation. Felix, on the other hand, had\nspoken in obedience to the belief that the more charming a woman is the\nmore numerous, literally, are her definite social uses.\n\nEugenia herself, as we know, had plenty of leisure to enumerate her\nuses. As I have had the honor of intimating, she had come four thousand\nmiles to seek her fortune; and it is not to be supposed that after this\ngreat effort she could neglect any apparent aid to advancement. It is\nmy misfortune that in attempting to describe in a short compass the\ndeportment of this remarkable woman I am obliged to express things\nrather brutally. I feel this to be the case, for instance, when I say\nthat she had primarily detected such an aid to advancement in the person\nof Robert Acton, but that she had afterwards remembered that a\nprudent archer has always a second bowstring. Eugenia was a woman of\nfinely-mingled motive, and her intentions were never sensibly gross.\nShe had a sort of aesthetic ideal for Clifford which seemed to her a\ndisinterested reason for taking him in hand. It was very well for a\nfresh-colored young gentleman to be ingenuous; but Clifford, really, was\ncrude. With such a pretty face he ought to have prettier manners. She\nwould teach him that, with a beautiful name, the expectation of a large\nproperty, and, as they said in Europe, a social position, an only son\nshould know how to carry himself.\n\nOnce Clifford had begun to come and see her by himself and for himself,\nhe came very often. He hardly knew why he should come; he saw her almost\nevery evening at his father’s house; he had nothing particular to say to\nher. She was not a young girl, and fellows of his age called only upon\nyoung girls. He exaggerated her age; she seemed to him an old woman; it\nwas happy that the Baroness, with all her intelligence, was incapable of\nguessing this. But gradually it struck Clifford that visiting old women\nmight be, if not a natural, at least, as they say of some articles of\ndiet, an acquired taste. The Baroness was certainly a very amusing old\nwoman; she talked to him as no lady--and indeed no gentleman--had ever\ntalked to him before.\n\n“You should go to Europe and make the tour,” she said to him one\nafternoon. “Of course, on leaving college you will go.”\n\n“I don’t want to go,” Clifford declared. “I know some fellows who have\nbeen to Europe. They say you can have better fun here.”\n\n“That depends. It depends upon your idea of fun. Your friends probably\nwere not introduced.”\n\n“Introduced?” Clifford demanded.\n\n“They had no opportunity of going into society; they formed no\n_relations_.” This was one of a certain number of words that the\nBaroness often pronounced in the French manner.\n\n“They went to a ball, in Paris; I know that,” said Clifford.\n\n“Ah, there are balls and balls; especially in Paris. No, you must go,\nyou know; it is not a thing from which you can dispense yourself. You\nneed it.”\n\n“Oh, I’m very well,” said Clifford. “I’m not sick.”\n\n“I don’t mean for your health, my poor child. I mean for your manners.”\n\n“I haven’t got any manners!” growled Clifford.\n\n“Precisely. You don’t mind my assenting to that, eh?” asked the Baroness\nwith a smile. “You must go to Europe and get a few. You can get them\nbetter there. It is a pity you might not have come while I was living\nin--in Germany. I would have introduced you; I had a charming little\ncircle. You would perhaps have been rather young; but the younger one\nbegins, I think, the better. Now, at any rate, you have no time to lose,\nand when I return you must immediately come to me.”\n\nAll this, to Clifford’s apprehension, was a great mixture--his beginning\nyoung, Eugenia’s return to Europe, his being introduced to her charming\nlittle circle. What was he to begin, and what was her little circle? His\nideas about her marriage had a good deal of vagueness; but they were\nin so far definite as that he felt it to be a matter not to be freely\nmentioned. He sat and looked all round the room; he supposed she was\nalluding in some way to her marriage.\n\n“Oh, I don’t want to go to Germany,” he said; it seemed to him the most\nconvenient thing to say.\n\nShe looked at him a while, smiling with her lips, but not with her eyes.\n\n“You have scruples?” she asked.\n\n“Scruples?” said Clifford.\n\n“You young people, here, are very singular; one doesn’t know where to\nexpect you. When you are not extremely improper you are so terribly\nproper. I dare say you think that, owing to my irregular marriage, I\nlive with loose people. You were never more mistaken. I have been all\nthe more particular.”\n\n“Oh, no,” said Clifford, honestly distressed. “I never thought such a\nthing as that.”\n\n“Are you very sure? I am convinced that your father does, and your\nsisters. They say to each other that here I am on my good behavior,\nbut that over there--married by the left hand--I associate with light\nwomen.”\n\n“Oh, no,” cried Clifford, energetically, “they don’t say such things as\nthat to each other!”\n\n“If they think them they had better say them,” the Baroness rejoined.\n“Then they can be contradicted. Please contradict that whenever you hear\nit, and don’t be afraid of coming to see me on account of the company I\nkeep. I have the honor of knowing more distinguished men, my poor child,\nthan you are likely to see in a life-time. I see very few women; but\nthose are women of rank. So, my dear young Puritan, you needn’t be\nafraid. I am not in the least one of those who think that the society of\nwomen who have lost their place in the _vrai monde_ is necessary to form\na young man. I have never taken that tone. I have kept my place myself,\nand I think we are a much better school than the others. Trust me,\nClifford, and I will prove that to you,” the Baroness continued, while\nshe made the agreeable reflection that she could not, at least, be\naccused of perverting her young kinsman. “So if you ever fall among\nthieves don’t go about saying I sent you to them.”\n\nClifford thought it so comical that he should know--in spite of her\nfigurative language--what she meant, and that she should mean what he\nknew, that he could hardly help laughing a little, although he tried\nhard. “Oh, no! oh, no!” he murmured.\n\n“Laugh out, laugh out, if I amuse you!” cried the Baroness. “I am here\nfor that!” And Clifford thought her a very amusing person indeed.\n“But remember,” she said on this occasion, “that you are coming--next\nyear--to pay me a visit over there.”\n\nAbout a week afterwards she said to him, point-blank, “Are you seriously\nmaking love to your little cousin?”\n\n“Seriously making love”--these words, on Madame Münster’s lips, had to\nClifford’s sense a portentous and embarrassing sound; he hesitated about\nassenting, lest he should commit himself to more than he understood.\n“Well, I shouldn’t say it if I was!” he exclaimed.\n\n“Why wouldn’t you say it?” the Baroness demanded. “Those things ought to\nbe known.”\n\n“I don’t care whether it is known or not,” Clifford rejoined. “But I\ndon’t want people looking at me.”\n\n“A young man of your importance ought to learn to bear observation--to\ncarry himself as if he were quite indifferent to it. I won’t say,\nexactly, unconscious,” the Baroness explained. “No, he must seem to know\nhe is observed, and to think it natural he should be; but he must appear\nperfectly used to it. Now you haven’t that, Clifford; you haven’t that\nat all. You must have that, you know. Don’t tell me you are not a young\nman of importance,” Eugenia added. “Don’t say anything so flat as that.”\n\n“Oh, no, you don’t catch me saying that!” cried Clifford.\n\n“Yes, you must come to Germany,” Madame Münster continued. “I will show\nyou how people can be talked about, and yet not seem to know it. You\nwill be talked about, of course, with me; it will be said you are my\nlover. I will show you how little one may mind that--how little I shall\nmind it.”\n\nClifford sat staring, blushing and laughing. “I shall mind it a good\ndeal!” he declared.\n\n“Ah, not too much, you know; that would be uncivil. But I give you leave\nto mind it a little; especially if you have a passion for Miss Acton.\n_Voyons_; as regards that, you either have or you have not. It is very\nsimple to say it.”\n\n“I don’t see why you want to know,” said Clifford.\n\n“You ought to want me to know. If one is arranging a marriage, one tells\none’s friends.”\n\n“Oh, I’m not arranging anything,” said Clifford.\n\n“You don’t intend to marry your cousin?”\n\n“Well, I expect I shall do as I choose!”\n\nThe Baroness leaned her head upon the back of her chair and closed her\neyes, as if she were tired. Then opening them again, “Your cousin is\nvery charming!” she said.\n\n“She is the prettiest girl in this place,” Clifford rejoined.\n\n“‘In this place’ is saying little; she would be charming anywhere. I am\nafraid you are entangled.”\n\n“Oh, no, I’m not entangled.”\n\n“Are you engaged? At your age that is the same thing.”\n\nClifford looked at the Baroness with some audacity. “Will you tell no\none?”\n\n“If it’s as sacred as that--no.”\n\n“Well, then--we are not!” said Clifford.\n\n“That’s the great secret--that you are not, eh?” asked the Baroness,\nwith a quick laugh. “I am very glad to hear it. You are altogether too\nyoung. A young man in your position must choose and compare; he must see\nthe world first. Depend upon it,” she added, “you should not settle that\nmatter before you have come abroad and paid me that visit. There are\nseveral things I should like to call your attention to first.”\n\n“Well, I am rather afraid of that visit,” said Clifford. “It seems to me\nit will be rather like going to school again.”\n\nThe Baroness looked at him a moment.\n\n“My dear child,” she said, “there is no agreeable man who has not, at\nsome moment, been to school to a clever woman--probably a little older\nthan himself. And you must be thankful when you get your instructions\ngratis. With me you would get it gratis.”\n\nThe next day Clifford told Lizzie Acton that the Baroness thought her\nthe most charming girl she had ever seen.\n\nLizzie shook her head. “No, she doesn’t!” she said.\n\n“Do you think everything she says,” asked Clifford, “is to be taken the\nopposite way?”\n\n“I think that is!” said Lizzie.\n\nClifford was going to remark that in this case the Baroness must desire\ngreatly to bring about a marriage between Mr. Clifford Wentworth and\nMiss Elizabeth Acton; but he resolved, on the whole, to suppress this\nobservation.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nIt seemed to Robert Acton, after Eugenia had come to his house, that\nsomething had passed between them which made them a good deal more\nintimate. It was hard to say exactly what, except her telling him that\nshe had taken her resolution with regard to the Prince Adolf; for Madame\nMünster’s visit had made no difference in their relations. He came to\nsee her very often; but he had come to see her very often before. It was\nagreeable to him to find himself in her little drawing-room; but this\nwas not a new discovery. There was a change, however, in this sense:\nthat if the Baroness had been a great deal in Acton’s thoughts before,\nshe was now never out of them. From the first she had been personally\nfascinating; but the fascination now had become intellectual as well. He\nwas constantly pondering her words and motions; they were as interesting\nas the factors in an algebraic problem. This is saying a good deal; for\nActon was extremely fond of mathematics. He asked himself whether it\ncould be that he was in love with her, and then hoped he was not; hoped\nit not so much for his own sake as for that of the amatory passion\nitself. If this was love, love had been overrated. Love was a poetic\nimpulse, and his own state of feeling with regard to the Baroness was\nlargely characterized by that eminently prosaic sentiment--curiosity.\nIt was true, as Acton with his quietly cogitative habit observed\nto himself, that curiosity, pushed to a given point, might become a\nromantic passion; and he certainly thought enough about this charming\nwoman to make him restless and even a little melancholy. It puzzled and\nvexed him at times to feel that he was not more ardent. He was not in\nthe least bent upon remaining a bachelor. In his younger years he had\nbeen--or he had tried to be--of the opinion that it would be a good deal\n“jollier” not to marry, and he had flattered himself that his single\ncondition was something of a citadel. It was a citadel, at all events,\nof which he had long since leveled the outworks. He had removed the guns\nfrom the ramparts; he had lowered the draw-bridge across the moat. The\ndraw-bridge had swayed lightly under Madame Münster’s step; why should\nhe not cause it to be raised again, so that she might be kept prisoner?\nHe had an idea that she would become--in time at least, and on learning\nthe conveniences of the place for making a lady comfortable--a tolerably\npatient captive. But the draw-bridge was never raised, and Acton’s\nbrilliant visitor was as free to depart as she had been to come. It was\npart of his curiosity to know why the deuce so susceptible a man was\n_not_ in love with so charming a woman. If her various graces were, as\nI have said, the factors in an algebraic problem, the answer to this\nquestion was the indispensable unknown quantity. The pursuit of the\nunknown quantity was extremely absorbing; for the present it taxed all\nActon’s faculties.\n\nToward the middle of August he was obliged to leave home for some days;\nan old friend, with whom he had been associated in China, had begged him\nto come to Newport, where he lay extremely ill. His friend got better,\nand at the end of a week Acton was released. I use the word “released”\n advisedly; for in spite of his attachment to his Chinese comrade he had\nbeen but a half-hearted visitor. He felt as if he had been called away\nfrom the theatre during the progress of a remarkably interesting drama.\nThe curtain was up all this time, and he was losing the fourth act; that\nfourth act which would have been so essential to a just appreciation of\nthe fifth. In other words, he was thinking about the Baroness, who, seen\nat this distance, seemed a truly brilliant figure. He saw at Newport\na great many pretty women, who certainly were figures as brilliant as\nbeautiful light dresses could make them; but though they talked a\ngreat deal--and the Baroness’s strong point was perhaps also her\nconversation--Madame Münster appeared to lose nothing by the comparison.\nHe wished she had come to Newport too. Would it not be possible to make\nup, as they said, a party for visiting the famous watering-place and\ninvite Eugenia to join it? It was true that the complete satisfaction\nwould be to spend a fortnight at Newport with Eugenia alone. It would be\na great pleasure to see her, in society, carry everything before her,\nas he was sure she would do. When Acton caught himself thinking these\nthoughts he began to walk up and down, with his hands in his pockets,\nfrowning a little and looking at the floor. What did it prove--for\nit certainly proved something--this lively disposition to be “off”\n somewhere with Madame Münster, away from all the rest of them? Such a\nvision, certainly, seemed a refined implication of matrimony, after the\nBaroness should have formally got rid of her informal husband. At\nany rate, Acton, with his characteristic discretion, forbore to give\nexpression to whatever else it might imply, and the narrator of these\nincidents is not obliged to be more definite.\n\nHe returned home rapidly, and, arriving in the afternoon, lost as little\ntime as possible in joining the familiar circle at Mr. Wentworth’s. On\nreaching the house, however, he found the piazzas empty. The doors and\nwindows were open, and their emptiness was made clear by the shafts of\nlamp-light from the parlors. Entering the house, he found Mr. Wentworth\nsitting alone in one of these apartments, engaged in the perusal of\nthe _North American Review_. After they had exchanged greetings and his\ncousin had made discreet inquiry about his journey, Acton asked what had\nbecome of Mr. Wentworth’s companions.\n\n“They are scattered about, amusing themselves as usual,” said the old\nman. “I saw Charlotte, a short time since, seated, with Mr. Brand,\nupon the piazza. They were conversing with their customary animation.\nI suppose they have joined her sister, who, for the hundredth time, was\ndoing the honors of the garden to her foreign cousin.”\n\n“I suppose you mean Felix,” said Acton. And on Mr. Wentworth’s\nassenting, he said, “And the others?”\n\n“Your sister has not come this evening. You must have seen her at home,”\n said Mr. Wentworth.\n\n“Yes. I proposed to her to come. She declined.”\n\n“Lizzie, I suppose, was expecting a visitor,” said the old man, with a\nkind of solemn slyness.\n\n“If she was expecting Clifford, he had not turned up.”\n\nMr. Wentworth, at this intelligence, closed the _North American Review_\nand remarked that he had understood Clifford to say that he was going to\nsee his cousin. Privately, he reflected that if Lizzie Acton had had no\nnews of his son, Clifford must have gone to Boston for the evening: an\nunnatural course of a summer night, especially when accompanied with\ndisingenuous representations.\n\n“You must remember that he has two cousins,” said Acton, laughing. And\nthen, coming to the point, “If Lizzie is not here,” he added, “neither\napparently is the Baroness.”\n\nMr. Wentworth stared a moment, and remembered that queer proposition of\nFelix’s. For a moment he did not know whether it was not to be wished\nthat Clifford, after all, might have gone to Boston. “The Baroness\nhas not honored us tonight,” he said. “She has not come over for three\ndays.”\n\n“Is she ill?” Acton asked.\n\n“No; I have been to see her.”\n\n“What is the matter with her?”\n\n“Well,” said Mr. Wentworth, “I infer she has tired of us.”\n\nActon pretended to sit down, but he was restless; he found it impossible\nto talk with Mr. Wentworth. At the end of ten minutes he took up his hat\nand said that he thought he would “go off.” It was very late; it was ten\no’clock.\n\nHis quiet-faced kinsman looked at him a moment. “Are you going home?” he\nasked.\n\nActon hesitated, and then answered that he had proposed to go over and\ntake a look at the Baroness.\n\n“Well, you are honest, at least,” said Mr. Wentworth, sadly.\n\n“So are you, if you come to that!” cried Acton, laughing. “Why shouldn’t\nI be honest?”\n\nThe old man opened the _North American_ again, and read a few lines.\n“If we have ever had any virtue among us, we had better keep hold of it\nnow,” he said. He was not quoting.\n\n“We have a Baroness among us,” said Acton. “That’s what we must keep\nhold of!” He was too impatient to see Madame Münster again to wonder\nwhat Mr. Wentworth was talking about. Nevertheless, after he had passed\nout of the house and traversed the garden and the little piece of road\nthat separated him from Eugenia’s provisional residence, he stopped a\nmoment outside. He stood in her little garden; the long window of\nher parlor was open, and he could see the white curtains, with the\nlamp-light shining through them, swaying softly to and fro in the warm\nnight wind. There was a sort of excitement in the idea of seeing Madame\nMünster again; he became aware that his heart was beating rather faster\nthan usual. It was this that made him stop, with a half-amused surprise.\nBut in a moment he went along the piazza, and, approaching the open\nwindow, tapped upon its lintel with his stick. He could see the Baroness\nwithin; she was standing in the middle of the room. She came to the\nwindow and pulled aside the curtain; then she stood looking at him a\nmoment. She was not smiling; she seemed serious.\n\n_“Mais entrez donc!”_ she said at last. Acton passed in across the\nwindow-sill; he wondered, for an instant, what was the matter with her.\nBut the next moment she had begun to smile and had put out her hand.\n“Better late than never,” she said. “It is very kind of you to come at\nthis hour.”\n\n“I have just returned from my journey,” said Acton.\n\n“Ah, very kind, very kind,” she repeated, looking about her where to\nsit.\n\n“I went first to the other house,” Acton continued. “I expected to find\nyou there.”\n\nShe had sunk into her usual chair; but she got up again, and began\nto move about the room. Acton had laid down his hat and stick; he was\nlooking at her, conscious that there was in fact a great charm in seeing\nher again. “I don’t know whether I ought to tell you to sit down,” she\nsaid. “It is too late to begin a visit.”\n\n“It’s too early to end one,” Acton declared; “and we needn’t mind the\nbeginning.”\n\nShe looked at him again, and, after a moment, dropped once more into her\nlow chair, while he took a place near her. “We are in the middle, then?”\n she asked. “Was that where we were when you went away? No, I haven’t\nbeen to the other house.”\n\n“Not yesterday, nor the day before, eh?”\n\n“I don’t know how many days it is.”\n\n“You are tired of it,” said Acton.\n\nShe leaned back in her chair; her arms were folded. “That is a terrible\naccusation, but I have not the courage to defend myself.”\n\n“I am not attacking you,” said Acton. “I expected something of this\nkind.”\n\n“It’s a proof of extreme intelligence. I hope you enjoyed your journey.”\n\n“Not at all,” Acton declared. “I would much rather have been here with\nyou.”\n\n“Now you _are_ attacking me,” said the Baroness. “You are contrasting my\ninconstancy with your own fidelity.”\n\n“I confess I never get tired of people I like.”\n\n“Ah, you are not a poor wicked foreign woman, with irritable nerves and\na sophisticated mind!”\n\n“Something has happened to you since I went away,” said Acton, changing\nhis place.\n\n“Your going away--that is what has happened to me.”\n\n“Do you mean to say that you have missed me?” he asked.\n\n“If I had meant to say it, it would not be worth your making a note of.\nI am very dishonest and my compliments are worthless.”\n\nActon was silent for some moments. “You have broken down,” he said at\nlast.\n\nMadame Münster left her chair, and began to move about.\n\n“Only for a moment. I shall pull myself together again.”\n\n“You had better not take it too hard. If you are bored, you needn’t be\nafraid to say so--to me at least.”\n\n“You shouldn’t say such things as that,” the Baroness answered. “You\nshould encourage me.”\n\n“I admire your patience; that is encouraging.”\n\n“You shouldn’t even say that. When you talk of my patience you are\ndisloyal to your own people. Patience implies suffering; and what have I\nhad to suffer?”\n\n“Oh, not hunger, not unkindness, certainly,” said Acton, laughing.\n“Nevertheless, we all admire your patience.”\n\n“You all detest me!” cried the Baroness, with a sudden vehemence,\nturning her back toward him.\n\n“You make it hard,” said Acton, getting up, “for a man to say something\ntender to you.” This evening there was something particularly striking\nand touching about her; an unwonted softness and a look of suppressed\nemotion. He felt himself suddenly appreciating the fact that she had\nbehaved very well. She had come to this quiet corner of the world\nunder the weight of a cruel indignity, and she had been so gracefully,\nmodestly thankful for the rest she found there. She had joined that\nsimple circle over the way; she had mingled in its plain, provincial\ntalk; she had shared its meagre and savorless pleasures. She had set\nherself a task, and she had rigidly performed it. She had conformed to\nthe angular conditions of New England life, and she had had the tact and\npluck to carry it off as if she liked them. Acton felt a more downright\nneed than he had ever felt before to tell her that he admired her and\nthat she struck him as a very superior woman. All along, hitherto,\nhe had been on his guard with her; he had been cautious, observant,\nsuspicious. But now a certain light tumult in his blood seemed to tell\nhim that a finer degree of confidence in this charming woman would be\nits own reward. “We don’t detest you,” he went on. “I don’t know what\nyou mean. At any rate, I speak for myself; I don’t know anything about\nthe others. Very likely, you detest them for the dull life they make you\nlead. Really, it would give me a sort of pleasure to hear you say so.”\n\nEugenia had been looking at the door on the other side of the room;\nnow she slowly turned her eyes toward Robert Acton. “What can be\nthe motive,” she asked, “of a man like you--an honest man, a _galant\nhomme_--in saying so base a thing as that?”\n\n“Does it sound very base?” asked Acton, candidly. “I suppose it\ndoes, and I thank you for telling me so. Of course, I don’t mean it\nliterally.”\n\nThe Baroness stood looking at him. “How do you mean it?” she asked.\n\nThis question was difficult to answer, and Acton, feeling the least\nbit foolish, walked to the open window and looked out. He stood there,\nthinking a moment, and then he turned back. “You know that document\nthat you were to send to Germany,” he said. “You called it your\n‘renunciation.’ Did you ever send it?”\n\nMadame Münster’s eyes expanded; she looked very grave. “What a singular\nanswer to my question!”\n\n“Oh, it isn’t an answer,” said Acton. “I have wished to ask you, many\ntimes. I thought it probable you would tell me yourself. The question,\non my part, seems abrupt now; but it would be abrupt at any time.”\n\nThe Baroness was silent a moment; and then, “I think I have told you too\nmuch!” she said.\n\nThis declaration appeared to Acton to have a certain force; he had\nindeed a sense of asking more of her than he offered her. He returned\nto the window, and watched, for a moment, a little star that twinkled\nthrough the lattice of the piazza. There were at any rate offers enough\nhe could make; perhaps he had hitherto not been sufficiently explicit in\ndoing so. “I wish you would ask something of me,” he presently said. “Is\nthere nothing I can do for you? If you can’t stand this dull life any\nmore, let me amuse you!”\n\nThe Baroness had sunk once more into a chair, and she had taken up a fan\nwhich she held, with both hands, to her mouth. Over the top of the fan\nher eyes were fixed on him. “You are very strange tonight,” she said,\nwith a little laugh.\n\n“I will do anything in the world,” he rejoined, standing in front\nof her. “Shouldn’t you like to travel about and see something of the\ncountry? Won’t you go to Niagara? You ought to see Niagara, you know.”\n\n“With you, do you mean?”\n\n“I should be delighted to take you.”\n\n“You alone?”\n\nActon looked at her, smiling, and yet with a serious air. “Well, yes; we\nmight go alone,” he said.\n\n“If you were not what you are,” she answered, “I should feel insulted.”\n\n“How do you mean--what I am?”\n\n“If you were one of the gentlemen I have been used to all my life. If\nyou were not a queer Bostonian.”\n\n“If the gentlemen you have been used to have taught you to expect\ninsults,” said Acton, “I am glad I am what I am. You had much better\ncome to Niagara.”\n\n“If you wish to ‘amuse’ me,” the Baroness declared, “you need go to no\nfurther expense. You amuse me very effectually.”\n\nHe sat down opposite to her; she still held her fan up to her face, with\nher eyes only showing above it. There was a moment’s silence, and then\nhe said, returning to his former question, “Have you sent that document\nto Germany?”\n\nAgain there was a moment’s silence. The expressive eyes of Madame\nMünster seemed, however, half to break it.\n\n“I will tell you--at Niagara!” she said.\n\nShe had hardly spoken when the door at the further end of the room\nopened--the door upon which, some minutes previous, Eugenia had fixed\nher gaze. Clifford Wentworth stood there, blushing and looking rather\nawkward. The Baroness rose, quickly, and Acton, more slowly, did the\nsame. Clifford gave him no greeting; he was looking at Eugenia.\n\n“Ah, you were here?” exclaimed Acton.\n\n“He was in Felix’s studio,” said Madame Münster. “He wanted to see his\nsketches.”\n\nClifford looked at Robert Acton, but said nothing; he only fanned\nhimself with his hat. “You chose a bad moment,” said Acton; “you hadn’t\nmuch light.”\n\n“I hadn’t any!” said Clifford, laughing.\n\n“Your candle went out?” Eugenia asked. “You should have come back here\nand lighted it again.”\n\nClifford looked at her a moment. “So I have--come back. But I have left\nthe candle!”\n\nEugenia turned away. “You are very stupid, my poor boy. You had better\ngo home.”\n\n“Well,” said Clifford, “good-night!”\n\n“Haven’t you a word to throw to a man when he has safely returned from a\ndangerous journey?” Acton asked.\n\n“How do you do?” said Clifford. “I thought--I thought you were----” and\nhe paused, looking at the Baroness again.\n\n“You thought I was at Newport, eh? So I was--this morning.”\n\n“Good-night, clever child!” said Madame Münster, over her shoulder.\n\nClifford stared at her--not at all like a clever child; and then, with\none of his little facetious growls, took his departure.\n\n“What is the matter with him?” asked Acton, when he was gone. “He seemed\nrather in a muddle.”\n\nEugenia, who was near the window, glanced out, listening a moment. “The\nmatter--the matter”--she answered. “But you don’t say such things here.”\n\n“If you mean that he had been drinking a little, you can say that.”\n\n“He doesn’t drink any more. I have cured him. And in return--he’s in\nlove with me.”\n\nIt was Acton’s turn to stare. He instantly thought of his sister; but\nhe said nothing about her. He began to laugh. “I don’t wonder at his\npassion! But I wonder at his forsaking your society for that of your\nbrother’s paint-brushes.”\n\nEugenia was silent a little. “He had not been in the studio. I invented\nthat at the moment.”\n\n“Invented it? For what purpose?”\n\n“He has an idea of being romantic. He has adopted the habit of coming to\nsee me at midnight--passing only through the orchard and through Felix’s\npainting-room, which has a door opening that way. It seems to amuse\nhim,” added Eugenia, with a little laugh.\n\nActon felt more surprise than he confessed to, for this was a new view\nof Clifford, whose irregularities had hitherto been quite without\nthe romantic element. He tried to laugh again, but he felt rather too\nserious, and after a moment’s hesitation his seriousness explained\nitself. “I hope you don’t encourage him,” he said. “He must not be\ninconstant to poor Lizzie.”\n\n“To your sister?”\n\n“You know they are decidedly intimate,” said Acton.\n\n“Ah,” cried Eugenia, smiling, “has she--has she----”\n\n“I don’t know,” Acton interrupted, “what she has. But I always supposed\nthat Clifford had a desire to make himself agreeable to her.”\n\n“Ah, _par exemple!_” the Baroness went on. “The little monster! The next\ntime he becomes sentimental I will him tell that he ought to be ashamed\nof himself.”\n\nActon was silent a moment. “You had better say nothing about it.”\n\n“I had told him as much already, on general grounds,” said the Baroness.\n“But in this country, you know, the relations of young people are so\nextraordinary that one is quite at sea. They are not engaged when\nyou would quite say they ought to be. Take Charlotte Wentworth, for\ninstance, and that young ecclesiastic. If I were her father I should\ninsist upon his marrying her; but it appears to be thought there is no\nurgency. On the other hand, you suddenly learn that a boy of twenty\nand a little girl who is still with her governess--your sister has no\ngoverness? Well, then, who is never away from her mamma--a young couple,\nin short, between whom you have noticed nothing beyond an exchange of\nthe childish pleasantries characteristic of their age, are on the\npoint of setting up as man and wife.” The Baroness spoke with a certain\nexaggerated volubility which was in contrast with the languid grace that\nhad characterized her manner before Clifford made his appearance. It\nseemed to Acton that there was a spark of irritation in her eye--a note\nof irony (as when she spoke of Lizzie being never away from her mother)\nin her voice. If Madame Münster was irritated, Robert Acton was vaguely\nmystified; she began to move about the room again, and he looked at her\nwithout saying anything. Presently she took out her watch, and, glancing\nat it, declared that it was three o’clock in the morning and that he\nmust go.\n\n“I have not been here an hour,” he said, “and they are still sitting up\nat the other house. You can see the lights. Your brother has not come\nin.”\n\n“Oh, at the other house,” cried Eugenia, “they are terrible people!\nI don’t know what they may do over there. I am a quiet little humdrum\nwoman; I have rigid rules and I keep them. One of them is not to\nhave visitors in the small hours--especially clever men like you. So\ngood-night!”\n\nDecidedly, the Baroness was incisive; and though Acton bade her\ngood-night and departed, he was still a good deal mystified.\n\nThe next day Clifford Wentworth came to see Lizzie, and Acton, who\nwas at home and saw him pass through the garden, took note of the\ncircumstance. He had a natural desire to make it tally with Madame\nMünster’s account of Clifford’s disaffection; but his ingenuity, finding\nitself unequal to the task, resolved at last to ask help of the young\nman’s candor. He waited till he saw him going away, and then he went out\nand overtook him in the grounds.\n\n“I wish very much you would answer me a question,” Acton said. “What\nwere you doing, last night, at Madame Münster’s?”\n\nClifford began to laugh and to blush, by no means like a young man with\na romantic secret. “What did she tell you?” he asked.\n\n“That is exactly what I don’t want to say.”\n\n“Well, I want to tell you the same,” said Clifford; “and unless I know\nit perhaps I can’t.”\n\nThey had stopped in a garden path; Acton looked hard at his rosy\nyoung kinsman. “She said she couldn’t fancy what had got into you; you\nappeared to have taken a violent dislike to her.”\n\nClifford stared, looking a little alarmed. “Oh, come,” he growled, “you\ndon’t mean that!”\n\n“And that when--for common civility’s sake--you came occasionally to the\nhouse you left her alone and spent your time in Felix’s studio, under\npretext of looking at his sketches.”\n\n“Oh, come!” growled Clifford, again.\n\n“Did you ever know me to tell an untruth?”\n\n“Yes, lots of them!” said Clifford, seeing an opening, out of the\ndiscussion, for his sarcastic powers. “Well,” he presently added, “I\nthought you were my father.”\n\n“You knew someone was there?”\n\n“We heard you coming in.”\n\nActon meditated. “You had been with the Baroness, then?”\n\n“I was in the parlor. We heard your step outside. I thought it was my\nfather.”\n\n“And on that,” asked Acton, “you ran away?”\n\n“She told me to go--to go out by the studio.”\n\nActon meditated more intensely; if there had been a chair at hand he\nwould have sat down. “Why should she wish you not to meet your father?”\n\n“Well,” said Clifford, “father doesn’t like to see me there.”\n\nActon looked askance at his companion and forbore to make any comment\nupon this assertion. “Has he said so,” he asked, “to the Baroness?”\n\n“Well, I hope not,” said Clifford. “He hasn’t said so--in so many\nwords--to me. But I know it worries him; and I want to stop worrying\nhim. The Baroness knows it, and she wants me to stop, too.”\n\n“To stop coming to see her?”\n\n“I don’t know about that; but to stop worrying father. Eugenia knows\neverything,” Clifford added, with an air of knowingness of his own.\n\n“Ah,” said Acton, interrogatively, “Eugenia knows everything?”\n\n“She knew it was not father coming in.”\n\n“Then why did you go?”\n\nClifford blushed and laughed afresh. “Well, I was afraid it was. And\nbesides, she told me to go, at any rate.”\n\n“Did she think it was I?” Acton asked.\n\n“She didn’t say so.”\n\nAgain Robert Acton reflected. “But you didn’t go,” he presently said;\n“you came back.”\n\n“I couldn’t get out of the studio,” Clifford rejoined. “The door was\nlocked, and Felix has nailed some planks across the lower half of the\nconfounded windows to make the light come in from above. So they were no\nuse. I waited there a good while, and then, suddenly, I felt ashamed.\nI didn’t want to be hiding away from my own father. I couldn’t stand\nit any longer. I bolted out, and when I found it was you I was a little\nflurried. But Eugenia carried it off, didn’t she?” Clifford added, in\nthe tone of a young humorist whose perception had not been permanently\nclouded by the sense of his own discomfort.\n\n“Beautifully!” said Acton. “Especially,” he continued, “when one\nremembers that you were very imprudent and that she must have been a\ngood deal annoyed.”\n\n“Oh,” cried Clifford, with the indifference of a young man who feels\nthat however he may have failed of felicity in behavior he is extremely\njust in his impressions, “Eugenia doesn’t care for anything!”\n\nActon hesitated a moment. “Thank you for telling me this,” he said at\nlast. And then, laying his hand on Clifford’s shoulder, he added,\n“Tell me one thing more: are you by chance a little in love with the\nBaroness?”\n\n“No, sir!” said Clifford, almost shaking off his hand.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nThe first sunday that followed Robert Acton’s return from Newport\nwitnessed a change in the brilliant weather that had long prevailed. The\nrain began to fall and the day was cold and dreary. Mr. Wentworth and\nhis daughters put on overshoes and went to church, and Felix Young,\nwithout overshoes, went also, holding an umbrella over Gertrude. It is\nto be feared that, in the whole observance, this was the privilege he\nmost highly valued. The Baroness remained at home; she was in neither a\ncheerful nor a devotional mood. She had, however, never been, during her\nresidence in the United States, what is called a regular attendant at\ndivine service; and on this particular Sunday morning of which I began\nwith speaking she stood at the window of her little drawing-room,\nwatching the long arm of a rose tree that was attached to her piazza,\nbut a portion of which had disengaged itself, sway to and fro, shake and\ngesticulate, against the dusky drizzle of the sky. Every now and then,\nin a gust of wind, the rose tree scattered a shower of water-drops\nagainst the window-pane; it appeared to have a kind of human movement--a\nmenacing, warning intention. The room was very cold; Madame Münster put\non a shawl and walked about. Then she determined to have some fire; and\nsummoning her ancient negress, the contrast of whose polished ebony and\nwhose crimson turban had been at first a source of satisfaction to her,\nshe made arrangements for the production of a crackling flame. This old\nwoman’s name was Azarina. The Baroness had begun by thinking that there\nwould be a savory wildness in her talk, and, for amusement, she\nhad encouraged her to chatter. But Azarina was dry and prim; her\nconversation was anything but African; she reminded Eugenia of the\ntiresome old ladies she met in society. She knew, however, how to make\na fire; so that after she had laid the logs, Eugenia, who was terribly\nbored, found a quarter of an hour’s entertainment in sitting and\nwatching them blaze and sputter. She had thought it very likely\nRobert Acton would come and see her; she had not met him since that\ninfelicitous evening. But the morning waned without his coming; several\ntimes she thought she heard his step on the piazza; but it was only a\nwindow-shutter shaking in a rain-gust. The Baroness, since the beginning\nof that episode in her career of which a slight sketch has been\nattempted in these pages, had had many moments of irritation. But today\nher irritation had a peculiar keenness; it appeared to feed upon\nitself. It urged her to do something; but it suggested no particularly\nprofitable line of action. If she could have done something at the\nmoment, on the spot, she would have stepped upon a European steamer and\nturned her back, with a kind of rapture, upon that profoundly mortifying\nfailure, her visit to her American relations. It is not exactly apparent\nwhy she should have termed this enterprise a failure, inasmuch as she\nhad been treated with the highest distinction for which allowance had\nbeen made in American institutions. Her irritation came, at bottom, from\nthe sense, which, always present, had suddenly grown acute, that the\nsocial soil on this big, vague continent was somehow not adapted for\ngrowing those plants whose fragrance she especially inclined to\ninhale and by which she liked to see herself surrounded--a species of\nvegetation for which she carried a collection of seedlings, as we\nmay say, in her pocket. She found her chief happiness in the sense of\nexerting a certain power and making a certain impression; and now she\nfelt the annoyance of a rather wearied swimmer who, on nearing shore,\nto land, finds a smooth straight wall of rock when he had counted upon\na clean firm beach. Her power, in the American air, seemed to have lost\nits prehensile attributes; the smooth wall of rock was insurmountable.\n_“Surely je n’en suis pas là,”_ she said to herself, “that I let it\nmake me uncomfortable that a Mr. Robert Acton shouldn’t honor me with a\nvisit!” Yet she was vexed that he had not come; and she was vexed at her\nvexation.\n\nHer brother, at least, came in, stamping in the hall and shaking the wet\nfrom his coat. In a moment he entered the room, with a glow in his cheek\nand half-a-dozen rain-drops glistening on his moustache. “Ah, you have a\nfire,” he said.\n\n_“Les beaux jours sont passés,”_ replied the Baroness.\n\n“Never, never! They have only begun,” Felix declared, planting himself\nbefore the hearth. He turned his back to the fire, placed his hands\nbehind him, extended his legs and looked away through the window with an\nexpression of face which seemed to denote the perception of rose-color\neven in the tints of a wet Sunday.\n\nHis sister, from her chair, looked up at him, watching him; and what she\nsaw in his face was not grateful to her present mood. She was puzzled\nby many things, but her brother’s disposition was a frequent source\nof wonder to her. I say frequent and not constant, for there were long\nperiods during which she gave her attention to other problems. Sometimes\nshe had said to herself that his happy temper, his eternal gaiety, was\nan affectation, a _pose_; but she was vaguely conscious that during the\npresent summer he had been a highly successful comedian. They had never\nyet had an explanation; she had not known the need of one. Felix was\npresumably following the bent of his disinterested genius, and she felt\nthat she had no advice to give him that he would understand. With this,\nthere was always a certain element of comfort about Felix--the assurance\nthat he would not interfere. He was very delicate, this pure-minded\nFelix; in effect, he was her brother, and Madame Münster felt that there\nwas a great propriety, every way, in that. It is true that Felix was\ndelicate; he was not fond of explanations with his sister; this was one\nof the very few things in the world about which he was uncomfortable.\nBut now he was not thinking of anything uncomfortable.\n\n“Dear brother,” said Eugenia at last, “do stop making _les yeux doux_ at\nthe rain.”\n\n“With pleasure. I will make them at you!” answered Felix.\n\n“How much longer,” asked Eugenia, in a moment, “do you propose to remain\nin this lovely spot?”\n\nFelix stared. “Do you want to go away--already?”\n\n“‘Already’ is delicious. I am not so happy as you.”\n\nFelix dropped into a chair, looking at the fire. “The fact is I _am_\nhappy,” he said in his light, clear tone.\n\n“And do you propose to spend your life in making love to Gertrude\nWentworth?”\n\n“Yes!” said Felix, smiling sidewise at his sister.\n\nThe Baroness returned his glance, much more gravely; and then, “Do you\nlike her?” she asked.\n\n“Don’t you?” Felix demanded.\n\nThe Baroness was silent a moment. “I will answer you in the words of the\ngentleman who was asked if he liked music: _‘Je ne la crains pas!’_”\n\n“She admires you immensely,” said Felix.\n\n“I don’t care for that. Other women should not admire one.”\n\n“They should dislike you?”\n\nAgain Madame Münster hesitated. “They should hate me! It’s a measure of\nthe time I have been losing here that they don’t.”\n\n“No time is lost in which one has been happy!” said Felix, with a bright\nsententiousness which may well have been a little irritating.\n\n“And in which,” rejoined his sister, with a harsher laugh, “one has\nsecured the affections of a young lady with a fortune!”\n\nFelix explained, very candidly and seriously. “I have secured Gertrude’s\naffection, but I am by no means sure that I have secured her fortune.\nThat may come--or it may not.”\n\n“Ah, well, it _may!_ That’s the great point.”\n\n“It depends upon her father. He doesn’t smile upon our union. You know\nhe wants her to marry Mr. Brand.”\n\n“I know nothing about it!” cried the Baroness. “Please to put on a log.”\n Felix complied with her request and sat watching the quickening of\nthe flame. Presently his sister added, “And you propose to elope with\nmademoiselle?”\n\n“By no means. I don’t wish to do anything that’s disagreeable to Mr.\nWentworth. He has been far too kind to us.”\n\n“But you must choose between pleasing yourself and pleasing him.”\n\n“I want to please everyone!” exclaimed Felix, joyously. “I have a good\nconscience. I made up my mind at the outset that it was not my place to\nmake love to Gertrude.”\n\n“So, to simplify matters, she made love to you!”\n\nFelix looked at his sister with sudden gravity. “You say you are not\nafraid of her,” he said. “But perhaps you ought to be--a little. She’s a\nvery clever person.”\n\n“I begin to see it!” cried the Baroness. Her brother, making no\nrejoinder, leaned back in his chair, and there was a long silence. At\nlast, with an altered accent, Madame Münster put another question. “You\nexpect, at any rate, to marry?”\n\n“I shall be greatly disappointed if we don’t.”\n\n“A disappointment or two will do you good!” the Baroness declared. “And,\nafterwards, do you mean to turn American?”\n\n“It seems to me I am a very good American already. But we shall go to\nEurope. Gertrude wants extremely to see the world.”\n\n“Ah, like me, when I came here!” said the Baroness, with a little laugh.\n\n“No, not like you,” Felix rejoined, looking at his sister with a certain\ngentle seriousness. While he looked at her she rose from her chair, and\nhe also got up. “Gertrude is not at all like you,” he went on; “but in\nher own way she is almost as clever.” He paused a moment; his soul was\nfull of an agreeable feeling and of a lively disposition to express it.\nHis sister, to his spiritual vision, was always like the lunar disk when\nonly a part of it is lighted. The shadow on this bright surface seemed\nto him to expand and to contract; but whatever its proportions, he\nalways appreciated the moonlight. He looked at the Baroness, and then\nhe kissed her. “I am very much in love with Gertrude,” he said. Eugenia\nturned away and walked about the room, and Felix continued. “She is very\ninteresting, and very different from what she seems. She has never had\na chance. She is very brilliant. We will go to Europe and amuse\nourselves.”\n\nThe Baroness had gone to the window, where she stood looking out. The\nday was drearier than ever; the rain was doggedly falling. “Yes, to\namuse yourselves,” she said at last, “you had decidedly better go to\nEurope!” Then she turned round, looking at her brother. A chair stood\nnear her; she leaned her hands upon the back of it. “Don’t you think it\nis very good of me,” she asked, “to come all this way with you simply to\nsee you properly married--if properly it is?”\n\n“Oh, it will be properly!” cried Felix, with light eagerness.\n\nThe Baroness gave a little laugh. “You are thinking only of yourself,\nand you don’t answer my question. While you are amusing yourself--with\nthe brilliant Gertrude--what shall I be doing?”\n\n_“Vous serez de la partie!”_ cried Felix.\n\n“Thank you: I should spoil it.” The Baroness dropped her eyes for some\nmoments. “Do you propose, however, to leave me here?” she inquired.\n\nFelix smiled at her. “My dearest sister, where you are concerned I never\npropose. I execute your commands.”\n\n“I believe,” said Eugenia, slowly, “that you are the most heartless\nperson living. Don’t you see that I am in trouble?”\n\n“I saw that you were not cheerful, and I gave you some good news.”\n\n“Well, let me give you some news,” said the Baroness. “You probably will\nnot have discovered it for yourself. Robert Acton wants to marry me.”\n\n“No, I had not discovered that. But I quite understand it. Why does it\nmake you unhappy?”\n\n“Because I can’t decide.”\n\n“Accept him, accept him!” cried Felix, joyously. “He is the best fellow\nin the world.”\n\n“He is immensely in love with me,” said the Baroness.\n\n“And he has a large fortune. Permit me in turn to remind you of that.”\n\n“Oh, I am perfectly aware of it,” said Eugenia. “That’s a great item in\nhis favor. I am terribly candid.” And she left her place and came nearer\nher brother, looking at him hard. He was turning over several things;\nshe was wondering in what manner he really understood her.\n\nThere were several ways of understanding her: there was what she said,\nand there was what she meant, and there was something, between the two,\nthat was neither. It is probable that, in the last analysis, what she\nmeant was that Felix should spare her the necessity of stating the case\nmore exactly and should hold himself commissioned to assist her by all\nhonorable means to marry the best fellow in the world. But in all this\nit was never discovered what Felix understood.\n\n“Once you have your liberty, what are your objections?” he asked.\n\n“Well, I don’t particularly like him.”\n\n“Oh, try a little.”\n\n“I am trying now,” said Eugenia. “I should succeed better if he didn’t\nlive here. I could never live here.”\n\n“Make him go to Europe,” Felix suggested.\n\n“Ah, there you speak of happiness based upon violent effort,” the\nBaroness rejoined. “That is not what I am looking for. He would never\nlive in Europe.”\n\n“He would live anywhere, with you!” said Felix, gallantly.\n\nHis sister looked at him still, with a ray of penetration in her\ncharming eyes; then she turned away again. “You see, at all events,” she\npresently went on, “that if it had been said of me that I had come over\nhere to seek my fortune it would have to be added that I have found it!”\n\n“Don’t leave it lying!” urged Felix, with smiling solemnity.\n\n“I am much obliged to you for your interest,” his sister declared, after\na moment. “But promise me one thing: _pas de zèle!_ If Mr. Acton should\nask you to plead his cause, excuse yourself.”\n\n“I shall certainly have the excuse,” said Felix, “that I have a cause of\nmy own to plead.”\n\n“If he should talk of me--favorably,” Eugenia continued, “warn him\nagainst dangerous illusions. I detest importunities; I want to decide at\nmy leisure, with my eyes open.”\n\n“I shall be discreet,” said Felix, “except to you. To you I will say,\nAccept him outright.”\n\nShe had advanced to the open doorway, and she stood looking at him. “I\nwill go and dress and think of it,” she said; and he heard her moving\nslowly to her apartments.\n\nLate in the afternoon the rain stopped, and just afterwards there was\na great flaming, flickering, trickling sunset. Felix sat in his\npainting-room and did some work; but at last, as the light, which had\nnot been brilliant, began to fade, he laid down his brushes and came out\nto the little piazza of the cottage. Here he walked up and down for some\ntime, looking at the splendid blaze of the western sky and saying, as he\nhad often said before, that this was certainly the country of sunsets.\nThere was something in these glorious deeps of fire that quickened his\nimagination; he always found images and promises in the western sky. He\nthought of a good many things--of roaming about the world with Gertrude\nWentworth; he seemed to see their possible adventures, in a glowing\nfrieze, between the cloud-bars; then of what Eugenia had just been\ntelling him. He wished very much that Madame Münster would make a\ncomfortable and honorable marriage. Presently, as the sunset expanded\nand deepened, the fancy took him of making a note of so magnificent a\npiece of coloring. He returned to his studio and fetched out a small\npanel, with his palette and brushes, and, placing the panel against a\nwindow-sill, he began to daub with great gusto. While he was so occupied\nhe saw Mr. Brand, in the distance, slowly come down from Mr. Wentworth’s\nhouse, nursing a large folded umbrella. He walked with a joyless,\nmeditative tread, and his eyes were bent upon the ground. Felix poised\nhis brush for a moment, watching him; then, by a sudden impulse, as\nhe drew nearer, advanced to the garden-gate and signaled to him--the\npalette and bunch of brushes contributing to this effect.\n\nMr. Brand stopped and started; then he appeared to decide to accept\nFelix’s invitation. He came out of Mr. Wentworth’s gate and passed along\nthe road; after which he entered the little garden of the cottage. Felix\nhad gone back to his sunset; but he made his visitor welcome while he\nrapidly brushed it in.\n\n“I wanted so much to speak to you that I thought I would call you,” he\nsaid, in the friendliest tone. “All the more that you have been to\nsee me so little. You have come to see my sister; I know that. But\nyou haven’t come to see me--the celebrated artist. Artists are very\nsensitive, you know; they notice those things.” And Felix turned round,\nsmiling, with a brush in his mouth.\n\nMr. Brand stood there with a certain blank, candid majesty, pulling\ntogether the large flaps of his umbrella. “Why should I come to see\nyou?” he asked. “I know nothing of Art.”\n\n“It would sound very conceited, I suppose,” said Felix, “if I were to\nsay that it would be a good little chance for you to learn something.\nYou would ask me why you should learn; and I should have no answer to\nthat. I suppose a minister has no need for Art, eh?”\n\n“He has need for good temper, sir,” said Mr. Brand, with decision.\n\nFelix jumped up, with his palette on his thumb and a movement of the\nliveliest deprecation. “That’s because I keep you standing there while I\nsplash my red paint! I beg a thousand pardons! You see what bad manners\nArt gives a man; and how right you are to let it alone. I didn’t mean\nyou should stand, either. The piazza, as you see, is ornamented with\nrustic chairs; though indeed I ought to warn you that they have nails in\nthe wrong places. I was just making a note of that sunset. I never saw\nsuch a blaze of different reds. It looks as if the Celestial City were\nin flames, eh? If that were really the case I suppose it would be the\nbusiness of you theologians to put out the fire. Fancy me--an ungodly\nartist--quietly sitting down to paint it!”\n\nMr. Brand had always credited Felix Young with a certain impudence, but\nit appeared to him that on this occasion his impudence was so great as\nto make a special explanation--or even an apology--necessary. And the\nimpression, it must be added, was sufficiently natural. Felix had at all\ntimes a brilliant assurance of manner which was simply the vehicle of\nhis good spirits and his good will; but at present he had a special\ndesign, and as he would have admitted that the design was audacious, so\nhe was conscious of having summoned all the arts of conversation to his\naid. But he was so far from desiring to offend his visitor that he was\nrapidly asking himself what personal compliment he could pay the young\nclergyman that would gratify him most. If he could think of it, he was\nprepared to pay it down. “Have you been preaching one of your beautiful\nsermons today?” he suddenly asked, laying down his palette. This was not\nwhat Felix had been trying to think of, but it was a tolerable stop-gap.\n\nMr. Brand frowned--as much as a man can frown who has very fair, soft\neyebrows, and, beneath them, very gentle, tranquil eyes. “No, I have not\npreached any sermon today. Did you bring me over here for the purpose of\nmaking that inquiry?”\n\nFelix saw that he was irritated, and he regretted it immensely; but he\nhad no fear of not being, in the end, agreeable to Mr. Brand. He\nlooked at him, smiling and laying his hand on his arm. “No, no, not for\nthat--not for that. I wanted to ask you something; I wanted to tell\nyou something. I am sure it will interest you very much. Only--as it is\nsomething rather private--we had better come into my little studio. I\nhave a western window; we can still see the sunset. _Andiamo!_” And he\ngave a little pat to his companion’s arm.\n\nHe led the way in; Mr. Brand stiffly and softly followed. The twilight\nhad thickened in the little studio; but the wall opposite the western\nwindow was covered with a deep pink flush. There were a great many\nsketches and half-finished canvasses suspended in this rosy glow, and\nthe corners of the room were vague and dusky. Felix begged Mr. Brand to\nsit down; then glancing round him, “By Jove, how pretty it looks!” he\ncried. But Mr. Brand would not sit down; he went and leaned against\nthe window; he wondered what Felix wanted of him. In the shadow, on the\ndarker parts of the wall, he saw the gleam of three or four pictures\nthat looked fantastic and surprising. They seemed to represent naked\nfigures. Felix stood there, with his head a little bent and his eyes\nfixed upon his visitor, smiling intensely, pulling his moustache. Mr.\nBrand felt vaguely uneasy. “It is very delicate--what I want to say,”\n Felix began. “But I have been thinking of it for some time.”\n\n“Please to say it as quickly as possible,” said Mr. Brand.\n\n“It’s because you are a clergyman, you know,” Felix went on. “I don’t\nthink I should venture to say it to a common man.”\n\nMr. Brand was silent a moment. “If it is a question of yielding to a\nweakness, of resenting an injury, I am afraid I am a very common man.”\n\n“My dearest friend,” cried Felix, “this is not an injury; it’s a\nbenefit--a great service! You will like it extremely. Only it’s so\ndelicate!” And, in the dim light, he continued to smile intensely. “You\nknow I take a great interest in my cousins--in Charlotte and Gertrude\nWentworth. That’s very evident from my having traveled some five\nthousand miles to see them.” Mr. Brand said nothing and Felix proceeded.\n“Coming into their society as a perfect stranger I received of course a\ngreat many new impressions, and my impressions had a great freshness, a\ngreat keenness. Do you know what I mean?”\n\n“I am not sure that I do; but I should like you to continue.”\n\n“I think my impressions have always a good deal of freshness,” said Mr.\nBrand’s entertainer; “but on this occasion it was perhaps particularly\nnatural that--coming in, as I say, from outside--I should be struck with\nthings that passed unnoticed among yourselves. And then I had my sister\nto help me; and she is simply the most observant woman in the world.”\n\n“I am not surprised,” said Mr. Brand, “that in our little circle two\nintelligent persons should have found food for observation. I am sure\nthat, of late, I have found it myself!”\n\n“Ah, but I shall surprise you yet!” cried Felix, laughing. “Both my\nsister and I took a great fancy to my cousin Charlotte.”\n\n“Your cousin Charlotte?” repeated Mr. Brand.\n\n“We fell in love with her from the first!”\n\n“You fell in love with Charlotte?” Mr. Brand murmured.\n\n“_Dame!_” exclaimed Felix, “she’s a very charming person; and Eugenia\nwas especially smitten.” Mr. Brand stood staring, and he pursued,\n“Affection, you know, opens one’s eyes, and we noticed something.\nCharlotte is not happy! Charlotte is in love.” And Felix, drawing\nnearer, laid his hand again upon his companion’s arm.\n\nThere was something akin to an acknowledgment of fascination in the way\nMr. Brand looked at him; but the young clergyman retained as yet quite\nenough self-possession to be able to say, with a good deal of solemnity,\n“She is not in love with you.”\n\nFelix gave a light laugh, and rejoined with the alacrity of a maritime\nadventurer who feels a puff of wind in his sail. “Ah, no; if she were in\nlove with me I should know it! I am not so blind as you.”\n\n“As I?”\n\n“My dear sir, you are stone blind. Poor Charlotte is dead in love with\n_you!_”\n\nMr. Brand said nothing for a moment; he breathed a little heavily. “Is\nthat what you wanted to say to me?” he asked.\n\n“I have wanted to say it these three weeks. Because of late she has been\nworse. I told you,” added Felix, “it was very delicate.”\n\n“Well, sir”--Mr. Brand began; “well, sir----”\n\n“I was sure you didn’t know it,” Felix continued. “But don’t you see--as\nsoon as I mention it--how everything is explained?” Mr. Brand answered\nnothing; he looked for a chair and softly sat down. Felix could see that\nhe was blushing; he had looked straight at his host hitherto, but now he\nlooked away. The foremost effect of what he had heard had been a sort of\nirritation of his modesty. “Of course,” said Felix, “I suggest nothing;\nit would be very presumptuous in me to advise you. But I think there is\nno doubt about the fact.”\n\nMr. Brand looked hard at the floor for some moments; he was oppressed\nwith a mixture of sensations. Felix, standing there, was very sure\nthat one of them was profound surprise. The innocent young man had been\ncompletely unsuspicious of poor Charlotte’s hidden flame. This gave\nFelix great hope; he was sure that Mr. Brand would be flattered. Felix\nthought him very transparent, and indeed he was so; he could neither\nsimulate nor dissimulate. “I scarcely know what to make of this,” he\nsaid at last, without looking up; and Felix was struck with the fact\nthat he offered no protest or contradiction. Evidently Felix had kindled\na train of memories--a retrospective illumination. It was making, to\nMr. Brand’s astonished eyes, a very pretty blaze; his second emotion had\nbeen a gratification of vanity.\n\n“Thank me for telling you,” Felix rejoined. “It’s a good thing to know.”\n\n“I am not sure of that,” said Mr. Brand.\n\n“Ah, don’t let her languish!” Felix murmured, lightly and softly.\n\n“You _do_ advise me, then?” And Mr. Brand looked up.\n\n“I congratulate you!” said Felix, smiling. He had thought at first his\nvisitor was simply appealing; but he saw he was a little ironical.\n\n“It is in your interest; you have interfered with me,” the young\nclergyman went on.\n\nFelix still stood and smiled. The little room had grown darker, and the\ncrimson glow had faded; but Mr. Brand could see the brilliant expression\nof his face. “I won’t pretend not to know what you mean,” said Felix\nat last. “But I have not really interfered with you. Of what you had\nto lose--with another person--you have lost nothing. And think what you\nhave gained!”\n\n“It seems to me I am the proper judge, on each side,” Mr. Brand\ndeclared. He got up, holding the brim of his hat against his mouth and\nstaring at Felix through the dusk.\n\n“You have lost an illusion!” said Felix.\n\n“What do you call an illusion?”\n\n“The belief that you really know--that you have ever really\nknown--Gertrude Wentworth. Depend upon that,” pursued Felix. “I don’t\nknow her yet; but I have no illusions; I don’t pretend to.”\n\nMr. Brand kept gazing, over his hat. “She has always been a lucid,\nlimpid nature,” he said, solemnly.\n\n“She has always been a dormant nature. She was waiting for a touchstone.\nBut now she is beginning to awaken.”\n\n“Don’t praise her to me!” said Mr. Brand, with a little quaver in his\nvoice. “If you have the advantage of me that is not generous.”\n\n“My dear sir, I am melting with generosity!” exclaimed Felix. “And I am\nnot praising my cousin. I am simply attempting a scientific definition\nof her. She doesn’t care for abstractions. Now I think the contrary\nis what you have always fancied--is the basis on which you have been\nbuilding. She is extremely preoccupied with the concrete. I care for the\nconcrete, too. But Gertrude is stronger than I; she whirls me along!”\n\nMr. Brand looked for a moment into the crown of his hat. “It’s a most\ninteresting nature.”\n\n“So it is,” said Felix. “But it pulls--it pulls--like a runaway horse.\nNow I like the feeling of a runaway horse; and if I am thrown out of\nthe vehicle it is no great matter. But if _you_ should be thrown, Mr.\nBrand”--and Felix paused a moment--“another person also would suffer\nfrom the accident.”\n\n“What other person?”\n\n“Charlotte Wentworth!”\n\nMr. Brand looked at Felix for a moment sidewise, mistrustfully; then his\neyes slowly wandered over the ceiling. Felix was sure he was secretly\nstruck with the romance of the situation. “I think this is none of our\nbusiness,” the young minister murmured.\n\n“None of mine, perhaps; but surely yours!”\n\nMr. Brand lingered still, looking at the ceiling; there was evidently\nsomething he wanted to say. “What do you mean by Miss Gertrude being\nstrong?” he asked abruptly.\n\n“Well,” said Felix meditatively, “I mean that she has had a great deal\nof self-possession. She was waiting--for years; even when she seemed,\nperhaps, to be living in the present. She knew how to wait; she had a\npurpose. That’s what I mean by her being strong.”\n\n“But what do you mean by her purpose?”\n\n“Well--the purpose to see the world!”\n\nMr. Brand eyed his strange informant askance again; but he said nothing.\nAt last he turned away, as if to take leave. He seemed bewildered,\nhowever; for instead of going to the door he moved toward the opposite\ncorner of the room. Felix stood and watched him for a moment--almost\ngroping about in the dusk; then he led him to the door, with a tender,\nalmost fraternal movement. “Is that all you have to say?” asked Mr.\nBrand.\n\n“Yes, it’s all--but it will bear a good deal of thinking of.”\n\nFelix went with him to the garden-gate, and watched him slowly walk\naway into the thickening twilight with a relaxed rigidity that tried\nto rectify itself. “He is offended, excited, bewildered, perplexed--and\nenchanted!” Felix said to himself. “That’s a capital mixture.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nSince that visit paid by the Baroness Münster to Mrs. Acton, of which\nsome account was given at an earlier stage of this narrative, the\nintercourse between these two ladies had been neither frequent nor\nintimate. It was not that Mrs. Acton had failed to appreciate Madame\nMünster’s charms; on the contrary, her perception of the graces of\nmanner and conversation of her brilliant visitor had been only too\nacute. Mrs. Acton was, as they said in Boston, very “intense,” and her\nimpressions were apt to be too many for her. The state of her health\nrequired the restriction of emotion; and this is why, receiving, as she\nsat in her eternal arm-chair, very few visitors, even of the soberest\nlocal type, she had been obliged to limit the number of her interviews\nwith a lady whose costume and manner recalled to her imagination--Mrs.\nActon’s imagination was a marvel--all that she had ever read of the most\nstirring historical periods. But she had sent the Baroness a great many\nquaintly-worded messages and a great many nosegays from her garden and\nbaskets of beautiful fruit. Felix had eaten the fruit, and the Baroness\nhad arranged the flowers and returned the baskets and the messages. On\nthe day that followed that rainy Sunday of which mention has been made,\nEugenia determined to go and pay the beneficent invalid a _“visite\nd’adieux”_; so it was that, to herself, she qualified her enterprise.\nIt may be noted that neither on the Sunday evening nor on the Monday\nmorning had she received that expected visit from Robert Acton. To his\nown consciousness, evidently he was “keeping away;” and as the Baroness,\non her side, was keeping away from her uncle’s, whither, for several\ndays, Felix had been the unembarrassed bearer of apologies and regrets\nfor absence, chance had not taken the cards from the hands of design.\nMr. Wentworth and his daughters had respected Eugenia’s seclusion;\ncertain intervals of mysterious retirement appeared to them, vaguely, a\nnatural part of the graceful, rhythmic movement of so remarkable a\nlife. Gertrude especially held these periods in honor; she wondered\nwhat Madame Münster did at such times, but she would not have permitted\nherself to inquire too curiously.\n\nThe long rain had freshened the air, and twelve hours’ brilliant\nsunshine had dried the roads; so that the Baroness, in the late\nafternoon, proposing to walk to Mrs. Acton’s, exposed herself to no\ngreat discomfort. As with her charming undulating step she moved along\nthe clean, grassy margin of the road, beneath the thickly-hanging boughs\nof the orchards, through the quiet of the hour and place and the rich\nmaturity of the summer, she was even conscious of a sort of luxurious\nmelancholy. The Baroness had the amiable weakness of attaching herself\nto places--even when she had begun with a little aversion; and now, with\nthe prospect of departure, she felt tenderly toward this well-wooded\ncorner of the Western world, where the sunsets were so beautiful and\none’s ambitions were so pure. Mrs. Acton was able to receive her; but on\nentering this lady’s large, freshly-scented room the Baroness saw that\nshe was looking very ill. She was wonderfully white and transparent,\nand, in her flowered arm-chair, she made no attempt to move. But she\nflushed a little--like a young girl, the Baroness thought--and she\nrested her clear, smiling eyes upon those of her visitor. Her voice\nwas low and monotonous, like a voice that had never expressed any human\npassions.\n\n“I have come to bid you good-bye,” said Eugenia. “I shall soon be going\naway.”\n\n“When are you going away?”\n\n“Very soon--any day.”\n\n“I am very sorry,” said Mrs. Acton. “I hoped you would stay--always.”\n\n“Always?” Eugenia demanded.\n\n“Well, I mean a long time,” said Mrs. Acton, in her sweet, feeble tone.\n“They tell me you are so comfortable--that you have got such a beautiful\nlittle house.”\n\nEugenia stared--that is, she smiled; she thought of her poor little\nchalet and she wondered whether her hostess were jesting. “Yes, my house\nis exquisite,” she said; “though not to be compared to yours.”\n\n“And my son is so fond of going to see you,” Mrs. Acton added. “I am\nafraid my son will miss you.”\n\n“Ah, dear madam,” said Eugenia, with a little laugh, “I can’t stay in\nAmerica for your son!”\n\n“Don’t you like America?”\n\nThe Baroness looked at the front of her dress. “If I liked it--that\nwould not be staying for your son!”\n\nMrs. Acton gazed at her with her grave, tender eyes, as if she had not\nquite understood. The Baroness at last found something irritating in\nthe sweet, soft stare of her hostess; and if one were not bound to be\nmerciful to great invalids she would almost have taken the liberty of\npronouncing her, mentally, a fool. “I am afraid, then, I shall never see\nyou again,” said Mrs. Acton. “You know I am dying.”\n\n“Ah, dear madam,” murmured Eugenia.\n\n“I want to leave my children cheerful and happy. My daughter will\nprobably marry her cousin.”\n\n“Two such interesting young people,” said the Baroness, vaguely. She was\nnot thinking of Clifford Wentworth.\n\n“I feel so tranquil about my end,” Mrs. Acton went on. “It is coming\nso easily, so surely.” And she paused, with her mild gaze always on\nEugenia’s.\n\nThe Baroness hated to be reminded of death; but even in its imminence,\nso far as Mrs. Acton was concerned, she preserved her good manners. “Ah,\nmadam, you are too charming an invalid,” she rejoined.\n\nBut the delicacy of this rejoinder was apparently lost upon her hostess,\nwho went on in her low, reasonable voice. “I want to leave my children\nbright and comfortable. You seem to me all so happy here--just as you\nare. So I wish you could stay. It would be so pleasant for Robert.”\n\nEugenia wondered what she meant by its being pleasant for Robert; but\nshe felt that she would never know what such a woman as that meant.\nShe got up; she was afraid Mrs. Acton would tell her again that she\nwas dying. “Good-bye, dear madam,” she said. “I must remember that your\nstrength is precious.”\n\nMrs. Acton took her hand and held it a moment. “Well, you _have_ been\nhappy here, haven’t you? And you like us all, don’t you? I wish you\nwould stay,” she added, “in your beautiful little house.”\n\nShe had told Eugenia that her waiting-woman would be in the hall, to\nshow her downstairs; but the large landing outside her door was empty,\nand Eugenia stood there looking about. She felt irritated; the dying\nlady had not _“la main heureuse.”_ She passed slowly downstairs, still\nlooking about. The broad staircase made a great bend, and in the angle\nwas a high window, looking westward, with a deep bench, covered with\na row of flowering plants in curious old pots of blue china-ware. The\nyellow afternoon light came in through the flowers and flickered a\nlittle on the white wainscots. Eugenia paused a moment; the house was\nperfectly still, save for the ticking, somewhere, of a great clock. The\nlower hall stretched away at the foot of the stairs, half covered over\nwith a large Oriental rug. Eugenia lingered a little, noticing a great\nmany things. _“Comme c’est bien!”_ she said to herself; such a large,\nsolid, irreproachable basis of existence the place seemed to her to\nindicate. And then she reflected that Mrs. Acton was soon to withdraw\nfrom it. The reflection accompanied her the rest of the way downstairs,\nwhere she paused again, making more observations. The hall was extremely\nbroad, and on either side of the front door was a wide, deeply-set\nwindow, which threw the shadows of everything back into the house.\nThere were high-backed chairs along the wall and big Eastern vases upon\ntables, and, on either side, a large cabinet with a glass front and\nlittle curiosities within, dimly gleaming. The doors were open--into the\ndarkened parlor, the library, the dining-room. All these rooms seemed\nempty. Eugenia passed along, and stopped a moment on the threshold of\neach. _“Comme c’est bien!”_ she murmured again; she had thought of just\nsuch a house as this when she decided to come to America. She opened\nthe front door for herself--her light tread had summoned none of the\nservants--and on the threshold she gave a last look. Outside, she\nwas still in the humor for curious contemplation; so instead of going\ndirectly down the little drive, to the gate, she wandered away towards\nthe garden, which lay to the right of the house. She had not gone\nmany yards over the grass before she paused quickly; she perceived a\ngentleman stretched upon the level verdure, beneath a tree. He had not\nheard her coming, and he lay motionless, flat on his back, with his\nhands clasped under his head, staring up at the sky; so that the\nBaroness was able to reflect, at her leisure, upon the question of\nhis identity. It was that of a person who had lately been much in her\nthoughts; but her first impulse, nevertheless, was to turn away; the\nlast thing she desired was to have the air of coming in quest of Robert\nActon. The gentleman on the grass, however, gave her no time to decide;\nhe could not long remain unconscious of so agreeable a presence. He\nrolled back his eyes, stared, gave an exclamation, and then jumped up.\nHe stood an instant, looking at her.\n\n“Excuse my ridiculous position,” he said.\n\n“I have just now no sense of the ridiculous. But, in case you have,\ndon’t imagine I came to see you.”\n\n“Take care,” rejoined Acton, “how you put it into my head! I was\nthinking of you.”\n\n“The occupation of extreme leisure!” said the Baroness. “To think of a\nwoman when you are in that position is no compliment.”\n\n“I didn’t say I was thinking well!” Acton affirmed, smiling.\n\nShe looked at him, and then she turned away.\n\n“Though I didn’t come to see you,” she said, “remember at least that I\nam within your gates.”\n\n“I am delighted--I am honored! Won’t you come into the house?”\n\n“I have just come out of it. I have been calling upon your mother. I\nhave been bidding her farewell.”\n\n“Farewell?” Acton demanded.\n\n“I am going away,” said the Baroness. And she turned away again, as if\nto illustrate her meaning.\n\n“When are you going?” asked Acton, standing a moment in his place. But\nthe Baroness made no answer, and he followed her.\n\n“I came this way to look at your garden,” she said, walking back to the\ngate, over the grass. “But I must go.”\n\n“Let me at least go with you.” He went with her, and they said nothing\ntill they reached the gate. It was open, and they looked down the road\nwhich was darkened over with long bosky shadows. “Must you go straight\nhome?” Acton asked.\n\nBut she made no answer. She said, after a moment, “Why have you not been\nto see me?” He said nothing, and then she went on, “Why don’t you answer\nme?”\n\n“I am trying to invent an answer,” Acton confessed.\n\n“Have you none ready?”\n\n“None that I can tell you,” he said. “But let me walk with you now.”\n\n“You may do as you like.”\n\nShe moved slowly along the road, and Acton went with her. Presently he\nsaid, “If I had done as I liked I would have come to see you several\ntimes.”\n\n“Is that invented?” asked Eugenia.\n\n“No, that is natural. I stayed away because----”\n\n“Ah, here comes the reason, then!”\n\n“Because I wanted to think about you.”\n\n“Because you wanted to lie down!” said the Baroness. “I have seen you\nlie down--almost--in my drawing-room.”\n\nActon stopped in the road, with a movement which seemed to beg her to\nlinger a little. She paused, and he looked at her awhile; he thought her\nvery charming. “You are jesting,” he said; “but if you are really going\naway it is very serious.”\n\n“If I stay,” and she gave a little laugh, “it is more serious still!”\n\n“When shall you go?”\n\n“As soon as possible.”\n\n“And why?”\n\n“Why should I stay?”\n\n“Because we all admire you so.”\n\n“That is not a reason. I am admired also in Europe.” And she began to\nwalk homeward again.\n\n“What could I say to keep you?” asked Acton. He wanted to keep her, and\nit was a fact that he had been thinking of her for a week. He was in\nlove with her now; he was conscious of that, or he thought he was; and\nthe only question with him was whether he could trust her.\n\n“What you can say to keep me?” she repeated. “As I want very much to go\nit is not in my interest to tell you. Besides, I can’t imagine.”\n\nHe went on with her in silence; he was much more affected by what she\nhad told him than appeared. Ever since that evening of his return from\nNewport her image had had a terrible power to trouble him. What Clifford\nWentworth had told him--that had affected him, too, in an adverse sense;\nbut it had not liberated him from the discomfort of a charm of which his\nintelligence was impatient. “She is not honest, she is not honest,” he\nkept murmuring to himself. That is what he had been saying to the summer\nsky, ten minutes before. Unfortunately, he was unable to say it\nfinally, definitively; and now that he was near her it seemed to matter\nwonderfully little. “She is a woman who will lie,” he had said to\nhimself. Now, as he went along, he reminded himself of this observation;\nbut it failed to frighten him as it had done before. He almost wished he\ncould make her lie and then convict her of it, so that he might see how\nhe should like that. He kept thinking of this as he walked by her side,\nwhile she moved forward with her light, graceful dignity. He had sat\nwith her before; he had driven with her; but he had never walked with\nher.\n\n“By Jove, how _comme il faut_ she is!” he said, as he observed her\nsidewise. When they reached the cottage in the orchard she passed into\nthe gate without asking him to follow; but she turned round, as he stood\nthere, to bid him good-night.\n\n“I asked you a question the other night which you never answered,” he\nsaid. “Have you sent off that document--liberating yourself?”\n\nShe hesitated for a single moment--very naturally. Then, “Yes,” she\nsaid, simply.\n\nHe turned away; he wondered whether that would do for his lie. But he\nsaw her again that evening, for the Baroness reappeared at her uncle’s.\nHe had little talk with her, however; two gentlemen had driven out from\nBoston, in a buggy, to call upon Mr. Wentworth and his daughters,\nand Madame Münster was an object of absorbing interest to both of the\nvisitors. One of them, indeed, said nothing to her; he only sat and\nwatched with intense gravity, and leaned forward solemnly, presenting\nhis ear (a very large one), as if he were deaf, whenever she dropped\nan observation. He had evidently been impressed with the idea of her\nmisfortunes and reverses: he never smiled. His companion adopted a\nlighter, easier style; sat as near as possible to Madame Münster;\nattempted to draw her out, and proposed every few moments a new topic\nof conversation. Eugenia was less vividly responsive than usual and\nhad less to say than, from her brilliant reputation, her interlocutor\nexpected, upon the relative merits of European and American\ninstitutions; but she was inaccessible to Robert Acton, who roamed about\nthe piazza with his hands in his pockets, listening for the grating\nsound of the buggy from Boston, as it should be brought round to the\nside-door. But he listened in vain, and at last he lost patience. His\nsister came to him and begged him to take her home, and he presently\nwent off with her. Eugenia observed him leaving the house with Lizzie;\nin her present mood the fact seemed a contribution to her irritated\nconviction that he had several precious qualities. “Even that\n_mal-élevée_ little girl,” she reflected, “makes him do what she\nwishes.”\n\nShe had been sitting just within one of the long windows that opened\nupon the piazza; but very soon after Acton had gone away she got up\nabruptly, just when the talkative gentleman from Boston was asking her\nwhat she thought of the “moral tone” of that city. On the piazza she\nencountered Clifford Wentworth, coming round from the other side of the\nhouse. She stopped him; she told him she wished to speak to him.\n\n“Why didn’t you go home with your cousin?” she asked.\n\nClifford stared. “Why, Robert has taken her,” he said.\n\n“Exactly so. But you don’t usually leave that to him.”\n\n“Oh,” said Clifford, “I want to see those fellows start off. They don’t\nknow how to drive.”\n\n“It is not, then, that you have quarreled with your cousin?”\n\nClifford reflected a moment, and then with a simplicity which had, for\nthe Baroness, a singularly baffling quality, “Oh, no; we have made up!”\n he said.\n\nShe looked at him for some moments; but Clifford had begun to be afraid\nof the Baroness’s looks, and he endeavored, now, to shift himself out\nof their range. “Why do you never come to see me any more?” she asked.\n“Have I displeased you?”\n\n“Displeased me? Well, I guess not!” said Clifford, with a laugh.\n\n“Why haven’t you come, then?”\n\n“Well, because I am afraid of getting shut up in that back room.”\n\nEugenia kept looking at him. “I should think you would like that.”\n\n“Like it!” cried Clifford.\n\n“I should, if I were a young man calling upon a charming woman.”\n\n“A charming woman isn’t much use to me when I am shut up in that back\nroom!”\n\n“I am afraid I am not of much use to you anywhere!” said Madame Münster.\n“And yet you know how I have offered to be.”\n\n“Well,” observed Clifford, by way of response, “there comes the buggy.”\n\n“Never mind the buggy. Do you know I am going away?”\n\n“Do you mean now?”\n\n“I mean in a few days. I leave this place.”\n\n“You are going back to Europe?”\n\n“To Europe, where you are to come and see me.”\n\n“Oh, yes, I’ll come out there,” said Clifford.\n\n“But before that,” Eugenia declared, “you must come and see me here.”\n\n“Well, I shall keep clear of that back room!” rejoined her simple young\nkinsman.\n\nThe Baroness was silent a moment. “Yes, you must come frankly--boldly.\nThat will be very much better. I see that now.”\n\n“I see it!” said Clifford. And then, in an instant, “What’s the matter\nwith that buggy?” His practiced ear had apparently detected an unnatural\ncreak in the wheels of the light vehicle which had been brought to the\nportico, and he hurried away to investigate so grave an anomaly.\n\nThe Baroness walked homeward, alone, in the starlight, asking herself\na question. Was she to have gained nothing--was she to have gained\nnothing?\n\nGertrude Wentworth had held a silent place in the little circle gathered\nabout the two gentlemen from Boston. She was not interested in the\nvisitors; she was watching Madame Münster, as she constantly watched\nher. She knew that Eugenia also was not interested--that she was bored;\nand Gertrude was absorbed in study of the problem how, in spite of\nher indifference and her absent attention, she managed to have such a\ncharming manner. That was the manner Gertrude would have liked to have;\nshe determined to cultivate it, and she wished that--to give her the\ncharm--she might in future very often be bored. While she was engaged in\nthese researches, Felix Young was looking for Charlotte, to whom he had\nsomething to say. For some time, now, he had had something to say to\nCharlotte, and this evening his sense of the propriety of holding some\nspecial conversation with her had reached the motive-point--resolved\nitself into acute and delightful desire. He wandered through the empty\nrooms on the large ground-floor of the house, and found her at last in\na small apartment denominated, for reasons not immediately apparent, Mr.\nWentworth’s “office:” an extremely neat and well-dusted room, with an\narray of law-books, in time-darkened sheep-skin, on one of the walls; a\nlarge map of the United States on the other, flanked on either side by\nan old steel engraving of one of Raphael’s Madonnas; and on the third\nseveral glass cases containing specimens of butterflies and beetles.\nCharlotte was sitting by a lamp, embroidering a slipper. Felix did not\nask for whom the slipper was destined; he saw it was very large.\n\nHe moved a chair toward her and sat down, smiling as usual, but, at\nfirst, not speaking. She watched him, with her needle poised, and with\na certain shy, fluttered look which she always wore when he approached\nher. There was something in Felix’s manner that quickened her modesty,\nher self-consciousness; if absolute choice had been given her she would\nhave preferred never to find herself alone with him; and in fact,\nthough she thought him a most brilliant, distinguished, and well-meaning\nperson, she had exercised a much larger amount of tremulous tact than\nhe had ever suspected, to circumvent the accident of _tête-à-tête_. Poor\nCharlotte could have given no account of the matter that would not have\nseemed unjust both to herself and to her foreign kinsman; she could only\nhave said--or rather, she would never have said it--that she did\nnot like so much gentleman’s society at once. She was not reassured,\naccordingly, when he began, emphasizing his words with a kind of\nadmiring radiance, “My dear cousin, I am enchanted at finding you\nalone.”\n\n“I am very often alone,” Charlotte observed. Then she quickly added, “I\ndon’t mean I am lonely!”\n\n“So clever a woman as you is never lonely,” said Felix. “You have\ncompany in your beautiful work.” And he glanced at the big slipper.\n\n“I like to work,” declared Charlotte, simply.\n\n“So do I!” said her companion. “And I like to idle too. But it is not\nto idle that I have come in search of you. I want to tell you something\nvery particular.”\n\n“Well,” murmured Charlotte; “of course, if you must----”\n\n“My dear cousin,” said Felix, “it’s nothing that a young lady may not\nlisten to. At least I suppose it isn’t. But _voyons_; you shall judge. I\nam terribly in love.”\n\n“Well, Felix,” began Miss Wentworth, gravely. But her very gravity\nappeared to check the development of her phrase.\n\n“I am in love with your sister; but in love, Charlotte--in love!” the\nyoung man pursued. Charlotte had laid her work in her lap; her hands\nwere tightly folded on top of it; she was staring at the carpet. “In\nshort, I’m in love, dear lady,” said Felix. “Now I want you to help me.”\n\n“To help you?” asked Charlotte, with a tremor.\n\n“I don’t mean with Gertrude; she and I have a perfect understanding; and\noh, how well she understands one! I mean with your father and with the\nworld in general, including Mr. Brand.”\n\n“Poor Mr. Brand!” said Charlotte, slowly, but with a simplicity which\nmade it evident to Felix that the young minister had not repeated to\nMiss Wentworth the talk that had lately occurred between them.\n\n“Ah, now, don’t say ‘poor’ Mr. Brand! I don’t pity Mr. Brand at all.\nBut I pity your father a little, and I don’t want to displease him.\nTherefore, you see, I want you to plead for me. You don’t think me very\nshabby, eh?”\n\n“Shabby?” exclaimed Charlotte softly, for whom Felix represented the\nmost polished and iridescent qualities of mankind.\n\n“I don’t mean in my appearance,” rejoined Felix, laughing; for Charlotte\nwas looking at his boots. “I mean in my conduct. You don’t think it’s an\nabuse of hospitality?”\n\n“To--to care for Gertrude?” asked Charlotte.\n\n“To have really expressed one’s self. Because I _have_ expressed myself,\nCharlotte; I must tell you the whole truth--I have! Of course I want to\nmarry her--and here is the difficulty. I held off as long as I could;\nbut she is such a terribly fascinating person! She’s a strange creature,\nCharlotte; I don’t believe you really know her.” Charlotte took up her\ntapestry again, and again she laid it down. “I know your father has had\nhigher views,” Felix continued; “and I think you have shared them. You\nhave wanted to marry her to Mr. Brand.”\n\n“Oh, no,” said Charlotte, very earnestly. “Mr. Brand has always admired\nher. But we did not want anything of that kind.”\n\nFelix stared. “Surely, marriage was what you proposed.”\n\n“Yes; but we didn’t wish to force her.”\n\n“_A la bonne heure!_ That’s very unsafe you know. With these arranged\nmarriages there is often the deuce to pay.”\n\n“Oh, Felix,” said Charlotte, “we didn’t want to ‘arrange.’”\n\n“I am delighted to hear that. Because in such cases--even when the\nwoman is a thoroughly good creature--she can’t help looking for a\ncompensation. A charming fellow comes along--and _voilà!_” Charlotte sat\nmutely staring at the floor, and Felix presently added, “Do go on with\nyour slipper, I like to see you work.”\n\nCharlotte took up her variegated canvas, and began to draw vague blue\nstitches in a big round rose. “If Gertrude is so--so strange,” she said,\n“why do you want to marry her?”\n\n“Ah, that’s it, dear Charlotte! I like strange women; I always have\nliked them. Ask Eugenia! And Gertrude is wonderful; she says the most\nbeautiful things!”\n\nCharlotte looked at him, almost for the first time, as if her meaning\nrequired to be severely pointed. “You have a great influence over her.”\n\n“Yes--and no!” said Felix. “I had at first, I think; but now it is six\nof one and half-a-dozen of the other; it is reciprocal. She affects me\nstrongly--for she _is_ so strong. I don’t believe you know her; it’s a\nbeautiful nature.”\n\n“Oh, yes, Felix; I have always thought Gertrude’s nature beautiful.”\n\n“Well, if you think so now,” cried the young man, “wait and see! She’s\na folded flower. Let me pluck her from the parent tree and you will see\nher expand. I’m sure you will enjoy it.”\n\n“I don’t understand you,” murmured Charlotte. “I _can’t_, Felix.”\n\n“Well, you can understand this--that I beg you to say a good word for\nme to your father. He regards me, I naturally believe, as a very light\nfellow, a Bohemian, an irregular character. Tell him I am not all this;\nif I ever was, I have forgotten it. I am fond of pleasure--yes; but of\ninnocent pleasure. Pain is all one; but in pleasure, you know, there are\ntremendous distinctions. Say to him that Gertrude is a folded flower and\nthat I am a serious man!”\n\nCharlotte got up from her chair slowly rolling up her work. “We know you\nare very kind to everyone, Felix,” she said. “But we are extremely sorry\nfor Mr. Brand.”\n\n“Of course you are--you especially! Because,” added Felix hastily, “you\nare a woman. But I don’t pity him. It ought to be enough for any man\nthat you take an interest in him.”\n\n“It is not enough for Mr. Brand,” said Charlotte, simply. And she stood\nthere a moment, as if waiting conscientiously for anything more that\nFelix might have to say.\n\n“Mr. Brand is not so keen about his marriage as he was,” he presently\nsaid. “He is afraid of your sister. He begins to think she is wicked.”\n\nCharlotte looked at him now with beautiful, appealing eyes--eyes into\nwhich he saw the tears rising. “Oh, Felix, Felix,” she cried, “what have\nyou done to her?”\n\n“I think she was asleep; I have waked her up!”\n\nBut Charlotte, apparently, was really crying, she walked straight out\nof the room. And Felix, standing there and meditating, had the apparent\nbrutality to take satisfaction in her tears.\n\nLate that night Gertrude, silent and serious, came to him in the garden;\nit was a kind of appointment. Gertrude seemed to like appointments.\nShe plucked a handful of heliotrope and stuck it into the front of\nher dress, but she said nothing. They walked together along one of the\npaths, and Felix looked at the great, square, hospitable house, massing\nitself vaguely in the starlight, with all its windows darkened.\n\n“I have a little of a bad conscience,” he said. “I oughtn’t to meet you\nthis way till I have got your father’s consent.”\n\nGertrude looked at him for some time. “I don’t understand you.”\n\n“You very often say that,” he said. “Considering how little we\nunderstand each other, it is a wonder how well we get on!”\n\n“We have done nothing but meet since you came here--but meet alone. The\nfirst time I ever saw you we were alone,” Gertrude went on. “What is the\ndifference now? Is it because it is at night?”\n\n“The difference, Gertrude,” said Felix, stopping in the path, “the\ndifference is that I love you more--more than before!” And then they\nstood there, talking, in the warm stillness and in front of the closed\ndark house. “I have been talking to Charlotte--been trying to bespeak\nher interest with your father. She has a kind of sublime perversity; was\never a woman so bent upon cutting off her own head?”\n\n“You are too careful,” said Gertrude; “you are too diplomatic.”\n\n“Well,” cried the young man, “I didn’t come here to make anyone\nunhappy!”\n\nGertrude looked round her awhile in the odorous darkness. “I will do\nanything you please,” she said.\n\n“For instance?” asked Felix, smiling.\n\n“I will go away. I will do anything you please.”\n\nFelix looked at her in solemn admiration. “Yes, we will go away,” he\nsaid. “But we will make peace first.”\n\nGertrude looked about her again, and then she broke out, passionately,\n“Why do they try to make one feel guilty? Why do they make it so\ndifficult? Why can’t they understand?”\n\n“I will make them understand!” said Felix. He drew her hand into his\narm, and they wandered about in the garden, talking, for an hour.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nFelix allowed Charlotte time to plead his cause; and then, on the third\nday, he sought an interview with his uncle. It was in the morning;\nMr. Wentworth was in his office; and, on going in, Felix found that\nCharlotte was at that moment in conference with her father. She had, in\nfact, been constantly near him since her interview with Felix; she\nhad made up her mind that it was her duty to repeat very literally her\ncousin’s passionate plea. She had accordingly followed Mr. Wentworth\nabout like a shadow, in order to find him at hand when she should have\nmustered sufficient composure to speak. For poor Charlotte, in this\nmatter, naturally lacked composure; especially when she meditated upon\nsome of Felix’s intimations. It was not cheerful work, at the best, to\nkeep giving small hammer-taps to the coffin in which one had laid\naway, for burial, the poor little unacknowledged offspring of one’s own\nmisbehaving heart; and the occupation was not rendered more agreeable\nby the fact that the ghost of one’s stifled dream had been summoned from\nthe shades by the strange, bold words of a talkative young foreigner.\nWhat had Felix meant by saying that Mr. Brand was not so keen? To\nherself her sister’s justly depressed suitor had shown no sign of\nfaltering. Charlotte trembled all over when she allowed herself to\nbelieve for an instant now and then that, privately, Mr. Brand might\nhave faltered; and as it seemed to give more force to Felix’s words to\nrepeat them to her father, she was waiting until she should have taught\nherself to be very calm. But she had now begun to tell Mr. Wentworth\nthat she was extremely anxious. She was proceeding to develop this idea,\nto enumerate the objects of her anxiety, when Felix came in.\n\nMr. Wentworth sat there, with his legs crossed, lifting his dry, pure\ncountenance from the Boston _Advertiser_. Felix entered smiling, as if\nhe had something particular to say, and his uncle looked at him as if\nhe both expected and deprecated this event. Felix vividly expressing\nhimself had come to be a formidable figure to his uncle, who had not yet\narrived at definite views as to a proper tone. For the first time in\nhis life, as I have said, Mr. Wentworth shirked a responsibility; he\nearnestly desired that it might not be laid upon him to determine how\nhis nephew’s lighter propositions should be treated. He lived under an\napprehension that Felix might yet beguile him into assent to doubtful\ninductions, and his conscience instructed him that the best form of\nvigilance was the avoidance of discussion. He hoped that the pleasant\nepisode of his nephew’s visit would pass away without a further lapse of\nconsistency.\n\nFelix looked at Charlotte with an air of understanding, and then at Mr.\nWentworth, and then at Charlotte again. Mr. Wentworth bent his refined\neyebrows upon his nephew and stroked down the first page of the\n_Advertiser_. “I ought to have brought a bouquet,” said Felix, laughing.\n“In France they always do.”\n\n“We are not in France,” observed Mr. Wentworth, gravely, while Charlotte\nearnestly gazed at him.\n\n“No, luckily, we are not in France, where I am afraid I should have\na harder time of it. My dear Charlotte, have you rendered me that\ndelightful service?” And Felix bent toward her as if someone had been\npresenting him.\n\nCharlotte looked at him with almost frightened eyes; and Mr. Wentworth\nthought this might be the beginning of a discussion. “What is the\nbouquet for?” he inquired, by way of turning it off.\n\nFelix gazed at him, smiling. _“Pour la demande!”_ And then, drawing up\na chair, he seated himself, hat in hand, with a kind of conscious\nsolemnity.\n\nPresently he turned to Charlotte again. “My good Charlotte, my admirable\nCharlotte,” he murmured, “you have not played me false--you have not\nsided against me?”\n\nCharlotte got up, trembling extremely, though imperceptibly. “You must\nspeak to my father yourself,” she said. “I think you are clever enough.”\n\nBut Felix, rising too, begged her to remain. “I can speak better to an\naudience!” he declared.\n\n“I hope it is nothing disagreeable,” said Mr. Wentworth.\n\n“It’s something delightful, for me!” And Felix, laying down his hat,\nclasped his hands a little between his knees. “My dear uncle,” he said,\n“I desire, very earnestly, to marry your daughter Gertrude.” Charlotte\nsank slowly into her chair again, and Mr. Wentworth sat staring, with a\nlight in his face that might have been flashed back from an iceberg.\nHe stared and stared; he said nothing. Felix fell back, with his hands\nstill clasped. “Ah--you don’t like it. I was afraid!” He blushed deeply,\nand Charlotte noticed it--remarking to herself that it was the first\ntime she had ever seen him blush. She began to blush herself and to\nreflect that he might be much in love.\n\n“This is very abrupt,” said Mr. Wentworth, at last.\n\n“Have you never suspected it, dear uncle?” Felix inquired. “Well, that\nproves how discreet I have been. Yes, I thought you wouldn’t like it.”\n\n“It is very serious, Felix,” said Mr. Wentworth.\n\n“You think it’s an abuse of hospitality!” exclaimed Felix, smiling\nagain.\n\n“Of hospitality?--an abuse?” his uncle repeated very slowly.\n\n“That is what Felix said to me,” said Charlotte, conscientiously.\n\n“Of course you think so; don’t defend yourself!” Felix pursued. “It\n_is_ an abuse, obviously; the most I can claim is that it is perhaps a\npardonable one. I simply fell head over heels in love; one can hardly\nhelp that. Though you are Gertrude’s progenitor I don’t believe you\nknow how attractive she is. Dear uncle, she contains the elements of a\nsingularly--I may say a strangely--charming woman!”\n\n“She has always been to me an object of extreme concern,” said Mr.\nWentworth. “We have always desired her happiness.”\n\n“Well, here it is!” Felix declared. “I will make her happy. She believes\nit, too. Now hadn’t you noticed that?”\n\n“I had noticed that she was much changed,” Mr. Wentworth declared, in\na tone whose unexpressive, unimpassioned quality appeared to Felix to\nreveal a profundity of opposition. “It may be that she is only becoming\nwhat you call a charming woman.”\n\n“Gertrude, at heart, is so earnest, so true,” said Charlotte, very\nsoftly, fastening her eyes upon her father.\n\n“I delight to hear you praise her!” cried Felix.\n\n“She has a very peculiar temperament,” said Mr. Wentworth.\n\n“Eh, even that is praise!” Felix rejoined. “I know I am not the man you\nmight have looked for. I have no position and no fortune; I can give\nGertrude no place in the world. A place in the world--that’s what she\nought to have; that would bring her out.”\n\n“A place to do her duty!” remarked Mr. Wentworth.\n\n“Ah, how charmingly she does it--her duty!” Felix exclaimed, with a\nradiant face. “What an exquisite conception she has of it! But she comes\nhonestly by that, dear uncle.” Mr. Wentworth and Charlotte both looked\nat him as if they were watching a greyhound doubling. “Of course with\nme she will hide her light under a bushel,” he continued; “I being the\nbushel! Now I know you like me--you have certainly proved it. But you\nthink I am frivolous and penniless and shabby! Granted--granted--a\nthousand times granted. I have been a loose fish--a fiddler, a painter,\nan actor. But there is this to be said: In the first place, I fancy\nyou exaggerate; you lend me qualities I haven’t had. I have been a\nBohemian--yes; but in Bohemia I always passed for a gentleman. I wish\nyou could see some of my old _camarades_--they would tell you! It\nwas the liberty I liked, but not the opportunities! My sins were all\npeccadilloes; I always respected my neighbor’s property--my neighbor’s\nwife. Do you see, dear uncle?” Mr. Wentworth ought to have seen; his\ncold blue eyes were intently fixed. “And then, _c’est fini!_ It’s all\nover. _Je me range_. I have settled down to a jog-trot. I find I can\nearn my living--a very fair one--by going about the world and painting\nbad portraits. It’s not a glorious profession, but it is a perfectly\nrespectable one. You won’t deny that, eh? Going about the world, I say?\nI must not deny that, for that I am afraid I shall always do--in quest\nof agreeable sitters. When I say agreeable, I mean susceptible of\ndelicate flattery and prompt of payment. Gertrude declares she is\nwilling to share my wanderings and help to pose my models. She even\nthinks it will be charming; and that brings me to my third point.\nGertrude likes me. Encourage her a little and she will tell you so.”\n\nFelix’s tongue obviously moved much faster than the imagination of his\nauditors; his eloquence, like the rocking of a boat in a deep, smooth\nlake, made long eddies of silence. And he seemed to be pleading and\nchattering still, with his brightly eager smile, his uplifted eyebrows,\nhis expressive mouth, after he had ceased speaking, and while, with his\nglance quickly turning from the father to the daughter, he sat waiting\nfor the effect of his appeal. “It is not your want of means,” said Mr.\nWentworth, after a period of severe reticence.\n\n“Now it’s delightful of you to say that! Only don’t say it’s my want of\ncharacter. Because I have a character--I assure you I have; a small one,\na little slip of a thing, but still something tangible.”\n\n“Ought you not to tell Felix that it is Mr. Brand, father?” Charlotte\nasked, with infinite mildness.\n\n“It is not only Mr. Brand,” Mr. Wentworth solemnly declared. And he\nlooked at his knee for a long time. “It is difficult to explain,” he\nsaid. He wished, evidently, to be very just. “It rests on moral grounds,\nas Mr. Brand says. It is the question whether it is the best thing for\nGertrude.”\n\n“What is better--what is better, dear uncle?” Felix rejoined urgently,\nrising in his urgency and standing before Mr. Wentworth. His uncle had\nbeen looking at his knee; but when Felix moved he transferred his gaze\nto the handle of the door which faced him. “It is usually a fairly good\nthing for a girl to marry the man she loves!” cried Felix.\n\nWhile he spoke, Mr. Wentworth saw the handle of the door begin to turn;\nthe door opened and remained slightly ajar, until Felix had delivered\nhimself of the cheerful axiom just quoted. Then it opened altogether\nand Gertrude stood there. She looked excited; there was a spark in her\nsweet, dull eyes. She came in slowly, but with an air of resolution,\nand, closing the door softly, looked round at the three persons present.\nFelix went to her with tender gallantry, holding out his hand, and\nCharlotte made a place for her on the sofa. But Gertrude put her hands\nbehind her and made no motion to sit down.\n\n“We are talking of you!” said Felix.\n\n“I know it,” she answered. “That’s why I came.” And she fastened her\neyes on her father, who returned her gaze very fixedly. In his own cold\nblue eyes there was a kind of pleading, reasoning light.\n\n“It is better you should be present,” said Mr. Wentworth. “We are\ndiscussing your future.”\n\n“Why discuss it?” asked Gertrude. “Leave it to me.”\n\n“That is, to me!” cried Felix.\n\n“I leave it, in the last resort, to a greater wisdom than ours,” said\nthe old man.\n\nFelix rubbed his forehead gently. “But _en attendant_ the last resort,\nyour father lacks confidence,” he said to Gertrude.\n\n“Haven’t you confidence in Felix?” Gertrude was frowning; there was\nsomething about her that her father and Charlotte had never seen.\nCharlotte got up and came to her, as if to put her arm round her; but\nsuddenly, she seemed afraid to touch her.\n\nMr. Wentworth, however, was not afraid. “I have had more confidence in\nFelix than in you,” he said.\n\n“Yes, you have never had confidence in me--never, never! I don’t know\nwhy.”\n\n“Oh sister, sister!” murmured Charlotte.\n\n“You have always needed advice,” Mr. Wentworth declared. “You have had a\ndifficult temperament.”\n\n“Why do you call it difficult? It might have been easy, if you had\nallowed it. You wouldn’t let me be natural. I don’t know what you wanted\nto make of me. Mr. Brand was the worst.”\n\nCharlotte at last took hold of her sister. She laid her two hands upon\nGertrude’s arm. “He cares so much for you,” she almost whispered.\n\nGertrude looked at her intently an instant; then kissed her. “No, he\ndoes not,” she said.\n\n“I have never seen you so passionate,” observed Mr. Wentworth, with an\nair of indignation mitigated by high principles.\n\n“I am sorry if I offend you,” said Gertrude.\n\n“You offend me, but I don’t think you are sorry.”\n\n“Yes, father, she is sorry,” said Charlotte.\n\n“I would even go further, dear uncle,” Felix interposed. “I would\nquestion whether she really offends you. How can she offend you?”\n\nTo this Mr. Wentworth made no immediate answer. Then, in a moment, “She\nhas not profited as we hoped.”\n\n“Profited? _Ah voilà!_” Felix exclaimed.\n\nGertrude was very pale; she stood looking down. “I have told Felix I\nwould go away with him,” she presently said.\n\n“Ah, you have said some admirable things!” cried the young man.\n\n“Go away, sister?” asked Charlotte.\n\n“Away--away; to some strange country.”\n\n“That is to frighten you,” said Felix, smiling at Charlotte.\n\n“To--what do you call it?” asked Gertrude, turning an instant to Felix.\n“To Bohemia.”\n\n“Do you propose to dispense with preliminaries?” asked Mr. Wentworth,\ngetting up.\n\n“Dear uncle, _vous plaisantez!_” cried Felix. “It seems to me that these\nare preliminaries.”\n\nGertrude turned to her father. “I _have_ profited,” she said. “You\nwanted to form my character. Well, my character is formed--for my age.\nI know what I want; I have chosen. I am determined to marry this\ngentleman.”\n\n“You had better consent, sir,” said Felix very gently.\n\n“Yes, sir, you had better consent,” added a very different voice.\n\nCharlotte gave a little jump, and the others turned to the direction\nfrom which it had come. It was the voice of Mr. Brand, who had stepped\nthrough the long window which stood open to the piazza. He stood patting\nhis forehead with his pocket-handkerchief; he was very much flushed; his\nface wore a singular expression.\n\n“Yes, sir, you had better consent,” Mr. Brand repeated, coming forward.\n“I know what Miss Gertrude means.”\n\n“My dear friend!” murmured Felix, laying his hand caressingly on the\nyoung minister’s arm.\n\nMr. Brand looked at him; then at Mr. Wentworth; lastly at Gertrude. He\ndid not look at Charlotte. But Charlotte’s earnest eyes were fastened\nto his own countenance; they were asking an immense question of it.\nThe answer to this question could not come all at once; but some of the\nelements of it were there. It was one of the elements of it that Mr.\nBrand was very red, that he held his head very high, that he had a\nbright, excited eye and an air of embarrassed boldness--the air of a\nman who has taken a resolve, in the execution of which he apprehends\nthe failure, not of his moral, but of his personal, resources. Charlotte\nthought he looked very grand; and it is incontestable that Mr. Brand\nfelt very grand. This, in fact, was the grandest moment of his life;\nand it was natural that such a moment should contain opportunities of\nawkwardness for a large, stout, modest young man.\n\n“Come in, sir,” said Mr. Wentworth, with an angular wave of his hand.\n“It is very proper that you should be present.”\n\n“I know what you are talking about,” Mr. Brand rejoined. “I heard what\nyour nephew said.”\n\n“And he heard what you said!” exclaimed Felix, patting him again on the\narm.\n\n“I am not sure that I understood,” said Mr. Wentworth, who had\nangularity in his voice as well as in his gestures.\n\nGertrude had been looking hard at her former suitor. She had been\npuzzled, like her sister; but her imagination moved more quickly than\nCharlotte’s. “Mr. Brand asked you to let Felix take me away,” she said\nto her father.\n\nThe young minister gave her a strange look. “It is not because I don’t\nwant to see you any more,” he declared, in a tone intended as it were\nfor publicity.\n\n“I shouldn’t think you would want to see me any more,” Gertrude\nanswered, gently.\n\nMr. Wentworth stood staring. “Isn’t this rather a change, sir?” he\ninquired.\n\n“Yes, sir.” And Mr. Brand looked anywhere; only still not at Charlotte.\n“Yes, sir,” he repeated. And he held his handkerchief a few moments to\nhis lips.\n\n“Where are our moral grounds?” demanded Mr. Wentworth, who had always\nthought Mr. Brand would be just the thing for a younger daughter with a\npeculiar temperament.\n\n“It is sometimes very moral to change, you know,” suggested Felix.\n\nCharlotte had softly left her sister’s side. She had edged gently toward\nher father, and now her hand found its way into his arm. Mr. Wentworth\nhad folded up the _Advertiser_ into a surprisingly small compass, and,\nholding the roll with one hand, he earnestly clasped it with the other.\nMr. Brand was looking at him; and yet, though Charlotte was so near, his\neyes failed to meet her own. Gertrude watched her sister.\n\n“It is better not to speak of change,” said Mr. Brand. “In one sense\nthere is no change. There was something I desired--something I asked of\nyou; I desire something still--I ask it of you.” And he paused a moment;\nMr. Wentworth looked bewildered. “I should like, in my ministerial\ncapacity, to unite this young couple.”\n\nGertrude, watching her sister, saw Charlotte flushing intensely, and Mr.\nWentworth felt her pressing upon his arm. “Heavenly Powers!” murmured\nMr. Wentworth. And it was the nearest approach to profanity he had ever\nmade.\n\n“That is very nice; that is very handsome!” Felix exclaimed.\n\n“I don’t understand,” said Mr. Wentworth; though it was plain that\neveryone else did.\n\n“That is very beautiful, Mr. Brand,” said Gertrude, emulating Felix.\n\n“I should like to marry you. It will give me great pleasure.”\n\n“As Gertrude says, it’s a beautiful idea,” said Felix.\n\nFelix was smiling, but Mr. Brand was not even trying to. He himself\ntreated his proposition very seriously. “I have thought of it, and I\nshould like to do it,” he affirmed.\n\nCharlotte, meanwhile, was staring with expanded eyes. Her imagination,\nas I have said, was not so rapid as her sister’s, but now it had taken\nseveral little jumps. “Father,” she murmured, “consent!”\n\nMr. Brand heard her; he looked away. Mr. Wentworth, evidently, had no\nimagination at all. “I have always thought,” he began, slowly, “that\nGertrude’s character required a special line of development.”\n\n“Father,” repeated Charlotte, _“consent.”_\n\nThen, at last, Mr. Brand looked at her. Her father felt her leaning more\nheavily upon his folded arm than she had ever done before; and this,\nwith a certain sweet faintness in her voice, made him wonder what was\nthe matter. He looked down at her and saw the encounter of her gaze with\nthe young theologian’s; but even this told him nothing, and he continued\nto be bewildered. Nevertheless, “I consent,” he said at last, “since Mr.\nBrand recommends it.”\n\n“I should like to perform the ceremony very soon,” observed Mr. Brand,\nwith a sort of solemn simplicity.\n\n“Come, come, that’s charming!” cried Felix, profanely.\n\nMr. Wentworth sank into his chair. “Doubtless, when you understand it,”\n he said, with a certain judicial asperity.\n\nGertrude went to her sister and led her away, and Felix having passed\nhis arm into Mr. Brand’s and stepped out of the long window with him,\nthe old man was left sitting there in unillumined perplexity.\n\nFelix did no work that day. In the afternoon, with Gertrude, he got into\none of the boats and floated about with idly-dipping oars. They talked a\ngood deal of Mr. Brand--though not exclusively.\n\n“That was a fine stroke,” said Felix. “It was really heroic.”\n\nGertrude sat musing, with her eyes upon the ripples. “That was what he\nwanted to be; he wanted to do something fine.”\n\n“He won’t be comfortable till he has married us,” said Felix. “So much\nthe better.”\n\n“He wanted to be magnanimous; he wanted to have a fine moral pleasure.\nI know him so well,” Gertrude went on. Felix looked at her; she spoke\nslowly, gazing at the clear water. “He thought of it a great deal, night\nand day. He thought it would be beautiful. At last he made up his mind\nthat it was his duty, his duty to do just that--nothing less than that.\nHe felt exalted; he felt sublime. That’s how he likes to feel. It is\nbetter for him than if I had listened to him.”\n\n“It’s better for me,” smiled Felix. “But do you know, as regards the\nsacrifice, that I don’t believe he admired you when this decision was\ntaken quite so much as he had done a fortnight before?”\n\n“He never admired me. He admires Charlotte; he pitied me. I know him so\nwell.”\n\n“Well, then, he didn’t pity you so much.”\n\nGertrude looked at Felix a little, smiling. “You shouldn’t permit\nyourself,” she said, “to diminish the splendor of his action. He admires\nCharlotte,” she repeated.\n\n“That’s capital!” said Felix laughingly, and dipping his oars. I cannot\nsay exactly to which member of Gertrude’s phrase he alluded; but he\ndipped his oars again, and they kept floating about.\n\nNeither Felix nor his sister, on that day, was present at Mr.\nWentworth’s at the evening repast. The two occupants of the chalet dined\ntogether, and the young man informed his companion that his marriage was\nnow an assured fact. Eugenia congratulated him, and replied that if he\nwere as reasonable a husband as he had been, on the whole, a brother,\nhis wife would have nothing to complain of.\n\nFelix looked at her a moment, smiling. “I hope,” he said, “not to be\nthrown back on my reason.”\n\n“It is very true,” Eugenia rejoined, “that one’s reason is dismally\nflat. It’s a bed with the mattress removed.”\n\nBut the brother and sister, later in the evening, crossed over to\nthe larger house, the Baroness desiring to compliment her prospective\nsister-in-law. They found the usual circle upon the piazza, with the\nexception of Clifford Wentworth and Lizzie Acton; and as everyone stood\nup as usual to welcome the Baroness, Eugenia had an admiring audience\nfor her compliment to Gertrude.\n\nRobert Acton stood on the edge of the piazza, leaning against one of\nthe white columns, so that he found himself next to Eugenia while she\nacquitted herself of a neat little discourse of congratulation.\n\n“I shall be so glad to know you better,” she said; “I have seen so much\nless of you than I should have liked. Naturally; now I see the reason\nwhy! You will love me a little, won’t you? I think I may say I gain\non being known.” And terminating these observations with the softest\ncadence of her voice, the Baroness imprinted a sort of grand official\nkiss upon Gertrude’s forehead.\n\nIncreased familiarity had not, to Gertrude’s imagination, diminished\nthe mysterious impressiveness of Eugenia’s personality, and she felt\nflattered and transported by this little ceremony. Robert Acton\nalso seemed to admire it, as he admired so many of the gracious\nmanifestations of Madame Münster’s wit.\n\nThey had the privilege of making him restless, and on this occasion he\nwalked away, suddenly, with his hands in his pockets, and then came back\nand leaned against his column. Eugenia was now complimenting her uncle\nupon his daughter’s engagement, and Mr. Wentworth was listening with his\nusual plain yet refined politeness. It is to be supposed that by this\ntime his perception of the mutual relations of the young people who\nsurrounded him had become more acute; but he still took the matter very\nseriously, and he was not at all exhilarated.\n\n“Felix will make her a good husband,” said Eugenia. “He will be a\ncharming companion; he has a great quality--indestructible gaiety.”\n\n“You think that’s a great quality?” asked the old man.\n\nEugenia meditated, with her eyes upon his. “You think one gets tired of\nit, eh?”\n\n“I don’t know that I am prepared to say that,” said Mr. Wentworth.\n\n“Well, we will say, then, that it is tiresome for others but delightful\nfor one’s self. A woman’s husband, you know, is supposed to be her\nsecond self; so that, for Felix and Gertrude, gaiety will be a common\nproperty.”\n\n“Gertrude was always very gay,” said Mr. Wentworth. He was trying to\nfollow this argument.\n\nRobert Acton took his hands out of his pockets and came a little nearer\nto the Baroness. “You say you gain by being known,” he said. “One\ncertainly gains by knowing you.”\n\n“What have _you_ gained?” asked Eugenia.\n\n“An immense amount of wisdom.”\n\n“That’s a questionable advantage for a man who was already so wise!”\n\nActon shook his head. “No, I was a great fool before I knew you!”\n\n“And being a fool you made my acquaintance? You are very complimentary.”\n\n“Let me keep it up,” said Acton, laughing. “I hope, for our pleasure,\nthat your brother’s marriage will detain you.”\n\n“Why should I stop for my brother’s marriage when I would not stop for\nmy own?” asked the Baroness.\n\n“Why shouldn’t you stop in either case, now that, as you say, you have\ndissolved that mechanical tie that bound you to Europe?”\n\nThe Baroness looked at him a moment. “As I say? You look as if you\ndoubted it.”\n\n“Ah,” said Acton, returning her glance, “that is a remnant of my old\nfolly! We have other attractions,” he added. “We are to have another\nmarriage.”\n\nBut she seemed not to hear him; she was looking at him still. “My word\nwas never doubted before,” she said.\n\n“We are to have another marriage,” Acton repeated, smiling.\n\nThen she appeared to understand. “Another marriage?” And she looked at\nthe others. Felix was chattering to Gertrude; Charlotte, at a distance,\nwas watching them; and Mr. Brand, in quite another quarter, was turning\nhis back to them, and, with his hands under his coat-tails and his large\nhead on one side, was looking at the small, tender crescent of a young\nmoon. “It ought to be Mr. Brand and Charlotte,” said Eugenia, “but it\ndoesn’t look like it.”\n\n“There,” Acton answered, “you must judge just now by contraries. There\nis more than there looks to be. I expect that combination one of these\ndays; but that is not what I meant.”\n\n“Well,” said the Baroness, “I never guess my own lovers; so I can’t\nguess other people’s.”\n\nActon gave a loud laugh, and he was about to add a rejoinder when Mr.\nWentworth approached his niece. “You will be interested to hear,” the\nold man said, with a momentary aspiration toward jocosity, “of another\nmatrimonial venture in our little circle.”\n\n“I was just telling the Baroness,” Acton observed.\n\n“Mr. Acton was apparently about to announce his own engagement,” said\nEugenia.\n\nMr. Wentworth’s jocosity increased. “It is not exactly that; but it\nis in the family. Clifford, hearing this morning that Mr. Brand had\nexpressed a desire to tie the nuptial knot for his sister, took it into\nhis head to arrange that, while his hand was in, our good friend should\nperform a like ceremony for himself and Lizzie Acton.”\n\nThe Baroness threw back her head and smiled at her uncle; then turning,\nwith an intenser radiance, to Robert Acton, “I am certainly very stupid\nnot to have thought of that,” she said. Acton looked down at his\nboots, as if he thought he had perhaps reached the limits of legitimate\nexperimentation, and for a moment Eugenia said nothing more. It had\nbeen, in fact, a sharp knock, and she needed to recover herself. This\nwas done, however, promptly enough. “Where are the young people?” she\nasked.\n\n“They are spending the evening with my mother.”\n\n“Is not the thing very sudden?”\n\nActon looked up. “Extremely sudden. There had been a tacit\nunderstanding; but within a day or two Clifford appears to have received\nsome mysterious impulse to precipitate the affair.”\n\n“The impulse,” said the Baroness, “was the charms of your very pretty\nsister.”\n\n“But my sister’s charms were an old story; he had always known her.”\n Acton had begun to experiment again.\n\nHere, however, it was evident the Baroness would not help him. “Ah, one\ncan’t say! Clifford is very young; but he is a nice boy.”\n\n“He’s a likeable sort of boy, and he will be a rich man.” This was\nActon’s last experiment. Madame Münster turned away.\n\nShe made but a short visit and Felix took her home. In her little\ndrawing-room she went almost straight to the mirror over the\nchimney-piece, and, with a candle uplifted, stood looking into it. “I\nshall not wait for your marriage,” she said to her brother. “Tomorrow my\nmaid shall pack up.”\n\n“My dear sister,” Felix exclaimed, “we are to be married immediately!\nMr. Brand is too uncomfortable.”\n\nBut Eugenia, turning and still holding her candle aloft, only looked\nabout the little sitting-room at her gimcracks and curtains and\ncushions. “My maid shall pack up,” she repeated. “_Bonté divine_, what\nrubbish! I feel like a strolling actress; these are my ‘properties.’”\n\n“Is the play over, Eugenia?” asked Felix.\n\nShe gave him a sharp glance. “I have spoken my part.”\n\n“With great applause!” said her brother.\n\n“Oh, applause--applause!” she murmured. And she gathered up two or three\nof her dispersed draperies. She glanced at the beautiful brocade, and\nthen, “I don’t see how I can have endured it!” she said.\n\n“Endure it a little longer. Come to my wedding.”\n\n“Thank you; that’s your affair. My affairs are elsewhere.”\n\n“Where are you going?”\n\n“To Germany--by the first ship.”\n\n“You have decided not to marry Mr. Acton?”\n\n“I have refused him,” said Eugenia.\n\nHer brother looked at her in silence. “I am sorry,” he rejoined at last.\n“But I was very discreet, as you asked me to be. I said nothing.”\n\n“Please continue, then, not to allude to the matter,” said Eugenia.\n\nFelix inclined himself gravely. “You shall be obeyed. But your position\nin Germany?” he pursued.\n\n“Please to make no observations upon it.”\n\n“I was only going to say that I supposed it was altered.”\n\n“You are mistaken.”\n\n“But I thought you had signed----”\n\n“I have not signed!” said the Baroness.\n\nFelix urged her no further, and it was arranged that he should\nimmediately assist her to embark.\n\nMr. Brand was indeed, it appeared, very impatient to consummate his\nsacrifice and deliver the nuptial benediction which would set it off so\nhandsomely; but Eugenia’s impatience to withdraw from a country in which\nshe had not found the fortune she had come to seek was even less to be\nmistaken. It is true she had not made any very various exertion; but\nshe appeared to feel justified in generalizing--in deciding that the\nconditions of action on this provincial continent were not favorable\nto really superior women. The elder world was, after all, their natural\nfield. The unembarrassed directness with which she proceeded to\napply these intelligent conclusions appeared to the little circle of\nspectators who have figured in our narrative but the supreme exhibition\nof a character to which the experience of life had imparted an\ninimitable pliancy. It had a distinct effect upon Robert Acton, who, for\nthe two days preceding her departure, was a very restless and irritated\nmortal. She passed her last evening at her uncle’s, where she had never\nbeen more charming; and in parting with Clifford Wentworth’s affianced\nbride she drew from her own finger a curious old ring and presented it\nto her with the prettiest speech and kiss. Gertrude, who as an affianced\nbride was also indebted to her gracious bounty, admired this little\nincident extremely, and Robert Acton almost wondered whether it did not\ngive him the right, as Lizzie’s brother and guardian, to offer in return\na handsome present to the Baroness. It would have made him extremely\nhappy to be able to offer a handsome present to the Baroness; but he\nabstained from this expression of his sentiments, and they were in\nconsequence, at the very last, by so much the less comfortable. It was\nalmost at the very last that he saw her--late the night before she went\nto Boston to embark.\n\n“For myself, I wish you might have stayed,” he said. “But not for your\nown sake.”\n\n“I don’t make so many differences,” said the Baroness. “I am simply\nsorry to be going.”\n\n“That’s a much deeper difference than mine,” Acton declared; “for you\nmean you are simply glad!”\n\nFelix parted with her on the deck of the ship. “We shall often meet over\nthere,” he said.\n\n“I don’t know,” she answered. “Europe seems to me much larger than\nAmerica.”\n\nMr. Brand, of course, in the days that immediately followed, was not the\nonly impatient spirit; but it may be said that of all the young spirits\ninterested in the event none rose more eagerly to the level of the\noccasion. Gertrude left her father’s house with Felix Young; they were\nimperturbably happy and they went far away. Clifford and his young wife\nsought their felicity in a narrower circle, and the latter’s influence\nupon her husband was such as to justify, strikingly, that theory of the\nelevating effect of easy intercourse with clever women which Felix had\npropounded to Mr. Wentworth. Gertrude was for a good while a distant\nfigure, but she came back when Charlotte married Mr. Brand. She was\npresent at the wedding feast, where Felix’s gaiety confessed to no\nchange. Then she disappeared, and the echo of a gaiety of her own,\nmingled with that of her husband, often came back to the home of her\nearlier years. Mr. Wentworth at last found himself listening for it;\nand Robert Acton, after his mother’s death, married a particularly nice\nyoung girl.\n\nThe End",
