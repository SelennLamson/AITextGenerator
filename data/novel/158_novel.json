 "text": "EMMA\n\nBy Jane Austen\n\n\n\n\nVOLUME I\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nEmma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home\nand happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of\nexistence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very\nlittle to distress or vex her.\n\nShe was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate,\nindulgent father; and had, in consequence of her sister's marriage, been\nmistress of his house from a very early period. Her mother had died\ntoo long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of\nher caresses; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as\ngoverness, who had fallen little short of a mother in affection.\n\nSixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse's family, less as a\ngoverness than a friend, very fond of both daughters, but particularly\nof Emma. Between _them_ it was more the intimacy of sisters. Even before\nMiss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess, the\nmildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint;\nand the shadow of authority being now long passed away, they had been\nliving together as friend and friend very mutually attached, and Emma\ndoing just what she liked; highly esteeming Miss Taylor's judgment, but\ndirected chiefly by her own.\n\nThe real evils, indeed, of Emma's situation were the power of having\nrather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little too\nwell of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to\nher many enjoyments. The danger, however, was at present so unperceived,\nthat they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her.\n\nSorrow came--a gentle sorrow--but not at all in the shape of any\ndisagreeable consciousness.--Miss Taylor married. It was Miss Taylor's\nloss which first brought grief. It was on the wedding-day of this\nbeloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any\ncontinuance. The wedding over, and the bride-people gone, her father and\nherself were left to dine together, with no prospect of a third to cheer\na long evening. Her father composed himself to sleep after dinner, as\nusual, and she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost.\n\nThe event had every promise of happiness for her friend. Mr. Weston\nwas a man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age, and\npleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering\nwith what self-denying, generous friendship she had always wished and\npromoted the match; but it was a black morning's work for her. The want\nof Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day. She recalled her\npast kindness--the kindness, the affection of sixteen years--how she had\ntaught and how she had played with her from five years old--how she had\ndevoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health--and how\nnursed her through the various illnesses of childhood. A large debt of\ngratitude was owing here; but the intercourse of the last seven\nyears, the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed\nIsabella's marriage, on their being left to each other, was yet a\ndearer, tenderer recollection. She had been a friend and companion such\nas few possessed: intelligent, well-informed, useful, gentle, knowing\nall the ways of the family, interested in all its concerns, and\npeculiarly interested in herself, in every pleasure, every scheme of\nhers--one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose, and who had\nsuch an affection for her as could never find fault.\n\nHow was she to bear the change?--It was true that her friend was going\nonly half a mile from them; but Emma was aware that great must be the\ndifference between a Mrs. Weston, only half a mile from them, and a Miss\nTaylor in the house; and with all her advantages, natural and domestic,\nshe was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude. She\ndearly loved her father, but he was no companion for her. He could not\nmeet her in conversation, rational or playful.\n\nThe evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and Mr. Woodhouse had\nnot married early) was much increased by his constitution and habits;\nfor having been a valetudinarian all his life, without activity of\nmind or body, he was a much older man in ways than in years; and though\neverywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable\ntemper, his talents could not have recommended him at any time.\n\nHer sister, though comparatively but little removed by matrimony, being\nsettled in London, only sixteen miles off, was much beyond her daily\nreach; and many a long October and November evening must be struggled\nthrough at Hartfield, before Christmas brought the next visit from\nIsabella and her husband, and their little children, to fill the house,\nand give her pleasant society again.\n\nHighbury, the large and populous village, almost amounting to a town,\nto which Hartfield, in spite of its separate lawn, and shrubberies, and\nname, did really belong, afforded her no equals. The Woodhouses\nwere first in consequence there. All looked up to them. She had many\nacquaintance in the place, for her father was universally civil, but\nnot one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss Taylor for even\nhalf a day. It was a melancholy change; and Emma could not but sigh over\nit, and wish for impossible things, till her father awoke, and made it\nnecessary to be cheerful. His spirits required support. He was a nervous\nman, easily depressed; fond of every body that he was used to, and\nhating to part with them; hating change of every kind. Matrimony, as the\norigin of change, was always disagreeable; and he was by no means yet\nreconciled to his own daughter's marrying, nor could ever speak of her\nbut with compassion, though it had been entirely a match of affection,\nwhen he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor too; and from his\nhabits of gentle selfishness, and of being never able to suppose that\nother people could feel differently from himself, he was very much\ndisposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for\nthem, and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the\nrest of her life at Hartfield. Emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully\nas she could, to keep him from such thoughts; but when tea came, it was\nimpossible for him not to say exactly as he had said at dinner,\n\n“Poor Miss Taylor!--I wish she were here again. What a pity it is that\nMr. Weston ever thought of her!”\n\n“I cannot agree with you, papa; you know I cannot. Mr. Weston is such\na good-humoured, pleasant, excellent man, that he thoroughly deserves\na good wife;--and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for\never, and bear all my odd humours, when she might have a house of her\nown?”\n\n“A house of her own!--But where is the advantage of a house of her own?\nThis is three times as large.--And you have never any odd humours, my\ndear.”\n\n“How often we shall be going to see them, and they coming to see us!--We\nshall be always meeting! _We_ must begin; we must go and pay wedding\nvisit very soon.”\n\n“My dear, how am I to get so far? Randalls is such a distance. I could\nnot walk half so far.”\n\n“No, papa, nobody thought of your walking. We must go in the carriage,\nto be sure.”\n\n“The carriage! But James will not like to put the horses to for such a\nlittle way;--and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our\nvisit?”\n\n“They are to be put into Mr. Weston's stable, papa. You know we have\nsettled all that already. We talked it all over with Mr. Weston last\nnight. And as for James, you may be very sure he will always like going\nto Randalls, because of his daughter's being housemaid there. I only\ndoubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else. That was your doing,\npapa. You got Hannah that good place. Nobody thought of Hannah till you\nmentioned her--James is so obliged to you!”\n\n“I am very glad I did think of her. It was very lucky, for I would not\nhave had poor James think himself slighted upon any account; and I am\nsure she will make a very good servant: she is a civil, pretty-spoken\ngirl; I have a great opinion of her. Whenever I see her, she always\ncurtseys and asks me how I do, in a very pretty manner; and when you\nhave had her here to do needlework, I observe she always turns the lock\nof the door the right way and never bangs it. I am sure she will be an\nexcellent servant; and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor\nto have somebody about her that she is used to see. Whenever James goes\nover to see his daughter, you know, she will be hearing of us. He will\nbe able to tell her how we all are.”\n\nEmma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas, and\nhoped, by the help of backgammon, to get her father tolerably\nthrough the evening, and be attacked by no regrets but her own. The\nbackgammon-table was placed; but a visitor immediately afterwards walked\nin and made it unnecessary.\n\nMr. Knightley, a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty, was not\nonly a very old and intimate friend of the family, but particularly\nconnected with it, as the elder brother of Isabella's husband. He lived\nabout a mile from Highbury, was a frequent visitor, and always welcome,\nand at this time more welcome than usual, as coming directly from their\nmutual connexions in London. He had returned to a late dinner, after\nsome days' absence, and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all were\nwell in Brunswick Square. It was a happy circumstance, and animated\nMr. Woodhouse for some time. Mr. Knightley had a cheerful manner, which\nalways did him good; and his many inquiries after “poor Isabella” and\nher children were answered most satisfactorily. When this was over, Mr.\nWoodhouse gratefully observed, “It is very kind of you, Mr. Knightley,\nto come out at this late hour to call upon us. I am afraid you must have\nhad a shocking walk.”\n\n“Not at all, sir. It is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild that I\nmust draw back from your great fire.”\n\n“But you must have found it very damp and dirty. I wish you may not\ncatch cold.”\n\n“Dirty, sir! Look at my shoes. Not a speck on them.”\n\n“Well! that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal of rain\nhere. It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at\nbreakfast. I wanted them to put off the wedding.”\n\n“By the bye--I have not wished you joy. Being pretty well aware of what\nsort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry with my\ncongratulations; but I hope it all went off tolerably well. How did you\nall behave? Who cried most?”\n\n“Ah! poor Miss Taylor! 'Tis a sad business.”\n\n“Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse, if you please; but I cannot possibly say\n'poor Miss Taylor.' I have a great regard for you and Emma; but when it\ncomes to the question of dependence or independence!--At any rate, it\nmust be better to have only one to please than two.”\n\n“Especially when _one_ of those two is such a fanciful, troublesome\ncreature!” said Emma playfully. “That is what you have in your head, I\nknow--and what you would certainly say if my father were not by.”\n\n“I believe it is very true, my dear, indeed,” said Mr. Woodhouse, with a\nsigh. “I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome.”\n\n“My dearest papa! You do not think I could mean _you_, or suppose Mr.\nKnightley to mean _you_. What a horrible idea! Oh no! I meant only\nmyself. Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me, you know--in a\njoke--it is all a joke. We always say what we like to one another.”\n\nMr. Knightley, in fact, was one of the few people who could see faults\nin Emma Woodhouse, and the only one who ever told her of them: and\nthough this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself, she knew\nit would be so much less so to her father, that she would not have him\nreally suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by\nevery body.\n\n“Emma knows I never flatter her,” said Mr. Knightley, “but I meant no\nreflection on any body. Miss Taylor has been used to have two persons\nto please; she will now have but one. The chances are that she must be a\ngainer.”\n\n“Well,” said Emma, willing to let it pass--“you want to hear about\nthe wedding; and I shall be happy to tell you, for we all behaved\ncharmingly. Every body was punctual, every body in their best looks: not\na tear, and hardly a long face to be seen. Oh no; we all felt that we\nwere going to be only half a mile apart, and were sure of meeting every\nday.”\n\n“Dear Emma bears every thing so well,” said her father. “But, Mr.\nKnightley, she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor, and I am\nsure she _will_ miss her more than she thinks for.”\n\nEmma turned away her head, divided between tears and smiles. “It\nis impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion,” said Mr.\nKnightley. “We should not like her so well as we do, sir, if we could\nsuppose it; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor's\nadvantage; she knows how very acceptable it must be, at Miss Taylor's\ntime of life, to be settled in a home of her own, and how important to\nher to be secure of a comfortable provision, and therefore cannot allow\nherself to feel so much pain as pleasure. Every friend of Miss Taylor\nmust be glad to have her so happily married.”\n\n“And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me,” said Emma, “and a very\nconsiderable one--that I made the match myself. I made the match, you\nknow, four years ago; and to have it take place, and be proved in the\nright, when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again, may\ncomfort me for any thing.”\n\nMr. Knightley shook his head at her. Her father fondly replied, “Ah!\nmy dear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things, for\nwhatever you say always comes to pass. Pray do not make any more\nmatches.”\n\n“I promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must, indeed, for\nother people. It is the greatest amusement in the world! And after such\nsuccess, you know!--Every body said that Mr. Weston would never marry\nagain. Oh dear, no! Mr. Weston, who had been a widower so long, and who\nseemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife, so constantly occupied\neither in his business in town or among his friends here, always\nacceptable wherever he went, always cheerful--Mr. Weston need not spend\na single evening in the year alone if he did not like it. Oh no! Mr.\nWeston certainly would never marry again. Some people even talked of a\npromise to his wife on her deathbed, and others of the son and the\nuncle not letting him. All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the\nsubject, but I believed none of it.\n\n“Ever since the day--about four years ago--that Miss Taylor and I met\nwith him in Broadway Lane, when, because it began to drizzle, he darted\naway with so much gallantry, and borrowed two umbrellas for us from\nFarmer Mitchell's, I made up my mind on the subject. I planned the match\nfrom that hour; and when such success has blessed me in this instance,\ndear papa, you cannot think that I shall leave off match-making.”\n\n“I do not understand what you mean by 'success,'” said Mr. Knightley.\n“Success supposes endeavour. Your time has been properly and delicately\nspent, if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring\nabout this marriage. A worthy employment for a young lady's mind! But\nif, which I rather imagine, your making the match, as you call it, means\nonly your planning it, your saying to yourself one idle day, 'I think it\nwould be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr. Weston were to marry\nher,' and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards, why\ndo you talk of success? Where is your merit? What are you proud of? You\nmade a lucky guess; and _that_ is all that can be said.”\n\n“And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess?--I\npity you.--I thought you cleverer--for, depend upon it a lucky guess is\nnever merely luck. There is always some talent in it. And as to my\npoor word 'success,' which you quarrel with, I do not know that I am so\nentirely without any claim to it. You have drawn two pretty pictures;\nbut I think there may be a third--a something between the do-nothing and\nthe do-all. If I had not promoted Mr. Weston's visits here, and given\nmany little encouragements, and smoothed many little matters, it might\nnot have come to any thing after all. I think you must know Hartfield\nenough to comprehend that.”\n\n“A straightforward, open-hearted man like Weston, and a rational,\nunaffected woman like Miss Taylor, may be safely left to manage their\nown concerns. You are more likely to have done harm to yourself, than\ngood to them, by interference.”\n\n“Emma never thinks of herself, if she can do good to others,” rejoined\nMr. Woodhouse, understanding but in part. “But, my dear, pray do not\nmake any more matches; they are silly things, and break up one's family\ncircle grievously.”\n\n“Only one more, papa; only for Mr. Elton. Poor Mr. Elton! You like Mr.\nElton, papa,--I must look about for a wife for him. There is nobody in\nHighbury who deserves him--and he has been here a whole year, and has\nfitted up his house so comfortably, that it would be a shame to have him\nsingle any longer--and I thought when he was joining their hands to-day,\nhe looked so very much as if he would like to have the same kind office\ndone for him! I think very well of Mr. Elton, and this is the only way I\nhave of doing him a service.”\n\n“Mr. Elton is a very pretty young man, to be sure, and a very good young\nman, and I have a great regard for him. But if you want to shew him any\nattention, my dear, ask him to come and dine with us some day. That will\nbe a much better thing. I dare say Mr. Knightley will be so kind as to\nmeet him.”\n\n“With a great deal of pleasure, sir, at any time,” said Mr. Knightley,\nlaughing, “and I agree with you entirely, that it will be a much better\nthing. Invite him to dinner, Emma, and help him to the best of the fish\nand the chicken, but leave him to chuse his own wife. Depend upon it, a\nman of six or seven-and-twenty can take care of himself.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nMr. Weston was a native of Highbury, and born of a respectable family,\nwhich for the last two or three generations had been rising into\ngentility and property. He had received a good education, but, on\nsucceeding early in life to a small independence, had become indisposed\nfor any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged,\nand had satisfied an active, cheerful mind and social temper by entering\ninto the militia of his county, then embodied.\n\nCaptain Weston was a general favourite; and when the chances of his\nmilitary life had introduced him to Miss Churchill, of a great Yorkshire\nfamily, and Miss Churchill fell in love with him, nobody was surprized,\nexcept her brother and his wife, who had never seen him, and who were\nfull of pride and importance, which the connexion would offend.\n\nMiss Churchill, however, being of age, and with the full command of her\nfortune--though her fortune bore no proportion to the family-estate--was\nnot to be dissuaded from the marriage, and it took place, to the\ninfinite mortification of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, who threw her off with\ndue decorum. It was an unsuitable connexion, and did not produce much\nhappiness. Mrs. Weston ought to have found more in it, for she had a\nhusband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing due\nto her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him;\nbut though she had one sort of spirit, she had not the best. She had\nresolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother,\nbut not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother's\nunreasonable anger, nor from missing the luxuries of her former home.\nThey lived beyond their income, but still it was nothing in comparison\nof Enscombe: she did not cease to love her husband, but she wanted at\nonce to be the wife of Captain Weston, and Miss Churchill of Enscombe.\n\nCaptain Weston, who had been considered, especially by the Churchills,\nas making such an amazing match, was proved to have much the worst of\nthe bargain; for when his wife died, after a three years' marriage, he\nwas rather a poorer man than at first, and with a child to maintain.\nFrom the expense of the child, however, he was soon relieved. The boy\nhad, with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his\nmother's, been the means of a sort of reconciliation; and Mr. and Mrs.\nChurchill, having no children of their own, nor any other young creature\nof equal kindred to care for, offered to take the whole charge of the\nlittle Frank soon after her decease. Some scruples and some reluctance\nthe widower-father may be supposed to have felt; but as they were\novercome by other considerations, the child was given up to the care and\nthe wealth of the Churchills, and he had only his own comfort to seek,\nand his own situation to improve as he could.\n\nA complete change of life became desirable. He quitted the militia and\nengaged in trade, having brothers already established in a good way in\nLondon, which afforded him a favourable opening. It was a concern which\nbrought just employment enough. He had still a small house in Highbury,\nwhere most of his leisure days were spent; and between useful occupation\nand the pleasures of society, the next eighteen or twenty years of his\nlife passed cheerfully away. He had, by that time, realised an easy\ncompetence--enough to secure the purchase of a little estate adjoining\nHighbury, which he had always longed for--enough to marry a woman as\nportionless even as Miss Taylor, and to live according to the wishes of\nhis own friendly and social disposition.\n\nIt was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his\nschemes; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth,\nit had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could\npurchase Randalls, and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to;\nbut he had gone steadily on, with these objects in view, till they were\naccomplished. He had made his fortune, bought his house, and obtained\nhis wife; and was beginning a new period of existence, with every\nprobability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through. He had\nnever been an unhappy man; his own temper had secured him from that,\neven in his first marriage; but his second must shew him how delightful\na well-judging and truly amiable woman could be, and must give him the\npleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be\nchosen, to excite gratitude than to feel it.\n\nHe had only himself to please in his choice: his fortune was his own;\nfor as to Frank, it was more than being tacitly brought up as his\nuncle's heir, it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume\nthe name of Churchill on coming of age. It was most unlikely, therefore,\nthat he should ever want his father's assistance. His father had no\napprehension of it. The aunt was a capricious woman, and governed her\nhusband entirely; but it was not in Mr. Weston's nature to imagine that\nany caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear, and, as he\nbelieved, so deservedly dear. He saw his son every year in London, and\nwas proud of him; and his fond report of him as a very fine young man\nhad made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too. He was looked on as\nsufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and prospects a\nkind of common concern.\n\nMr. Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury, and a lively\ncuriosity to see him prevailed, though the compliment was so little\nreturned that he had never been there in his life. His coming to visit\nhis father had been often talked of but never achieved.\n\nNow, upon his father's marriage, it was very generally proposed, as a\nmost proper attention, that the visit should take place. There was not a\ndissentient voice on the subject, either when Mrs. Perry drank tea with\nMrs. and Miss Bates, or when Mrs. and Miss Bates returned the visit. Now\nwas the time for Mr. Frank Churchill to come among them; and the hope\nstrengthened when it was understood that he had written to his new\nmother on the occasion. For a few days, every morning visit in Highbury\nincluded some mention of the handsome letter Mrs. Weston had received.\n“I suppose you have heard of the handsome letter Mr. Frank Churchill\nhas written to Mrs. Weston? I understand it was a very handsome letter,\nindeed. Mr. Woodhouse told me of it. Mr. Woodhouse saw the letter, and\nhe says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life.”\n\nIt was, indeed, a highly prized letter. Mrs. Weston had, of course,\nformed a very favourable idea of the young man; and such a pleasing\nattention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense, and a most\nwelcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation\nwhich her marriage had already secured. She felt herself a most\nfortunate woman; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate\nshe might well be thought, where the only regret was for a partial\nseparation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled, and\nwho could ill bear to part with her.\n\nShe knew that at times she must be missed; and could not think, without\npain, of Emma's losing a single pleasure, or suffering an hour's ennui,\nfrom the want of her companionableness: but dear Emma was of no feeble\ncharacter; she was more equal to her situation than most girls would\nhave been, and had sense, and energy, and spirits that might be hoped\nwould bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and\nprivations. And then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of\nRandalls from Hartfield, so convenient for even solitary female walking,\nand in Mr. Weston's disposition and circumstances, which would make the\napproaching season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in\nthe week together.\n\nHer situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs.\nWeston, and of moments only of regret; and her satisfaction--her more\nthan satisfaction--her cheerful enjoyment, was so just and so apparent,\nthat Emma, well as she knew her father, was sometimes taken by surprize\nat his being still able to pity 'poor Miss Taylor,' when they left her\nat Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort, or saw her go away\nin the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her\nown. But never did she go without Mr. Woodhouse's giving a gentle sigh,\nand saying, “Ah, poor Miss Taylor! She would be very glad to stay.”\n\nThere was no recovering Miss Taylor--nor much likelihood of ceasing to\npity her; but a few weeks brought some alleviation to Mr. Woodhouse.\nThe compliments of his neighbours were over; he was no longer teased by\nbeing wished joy of so sorrowful an event; and the wedding-cake, which\nhad been a great distress to him, was all eat up. His own stomach\ncould bear nothing rich, and he could never believe other people to be\ndifferent from himself. What was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit\nfor any body; and he had, therefore, earnestly tried to dissuade them\nfrom having any wedding-cake at all, and when that proved vain, as\nearnestly tried to prevent any body's eating it. He had been at the\npains of consulting Mr. Perry, the apothecary, on the subject. Mr. Perry\nwas an intelligent, gentlemanlike man, whose frequent visits were one\nof the comforts of Mr. Woodhouse's life; and upon being applied to, he\ncould not but acknowledge (though it seemed rather against the bias\nof inclination) that wedding-cake might certainly disagree with\nmany--perhaps with most people, unless taken moderately. With such an\nopinion, in confirmation of his own, Mr. Woodhouse hoped to influence\nevery visitor of the newly married pair; but still the cake was eaten;\nand there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone.\n\nThere was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys being\nseen with a slice of Mrs. Weston's wedding-cake in their hands: but Mr.\nWoodhouse would never believe it.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nMr. Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way. He liked very much to\nhave his friends come and see him; and from various united causes, from\nhis long residence at Hartfield, and his good nature, from his fortune,\nhis house, and his daughter, he could command the visits of his\nown little circle, in a great measure, as he liked. He had not much\nintercourse with any families beyond that circle; his horror of late\nhours, and large dinner-parties, made him unfit for any acquaintance but\nsuch as would visit him on his own terms. Fortunately for him, Highbury,\nincluding Randalls in the same parish, and Donwell Abbey in the parish\nadjoining, the seat of Mr. Knightley, comprehended many such. Not\nunfrequently, through Emma's persuasion, he had some of the chosen and\nthe best to dine with him: but evening parties were what he preferred;\nand, unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company, there\nwas scarcely an evening in the week in which Emma could not make up a\ncard-table for him.\n\nReal, long-standing regard brought the Westons and Mr. Knightley; and by\nMr. Elton, a young man living alone without liking it, the privilege\nof exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the\nelegancies and society of Mr. Woodhouse's drawing-room, and the smiles\nof his lovely daughter, was in no danger of being thrown away.\n\nAfter these came a second set; among the most come-at-able of whom were\nMrs. and Miss Bates, and Mrs. Goddard, three ladies almost always at\nthe service of an invitation from Hartfield, and who were fetched and\ncarried home so often, that Mr. Woodhouse thought it no hardship for\neither James or the horses. Had it taken place only once a year, it\nwould have been a grievance.\n\nMrs. Bates, the widow of a former vicar of Highbury, was a very old\nlady, almost past every thing but tea and quadrille. She lived with her\nsingle daughter in a very small way, and was considered with all the\nregard and respect which a harmless old lady, under such untoward\ncircumstances, can excite. Her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree\nof popularity for a woman neither young, handsome, rich, nor married.\nMiss Bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having\nmuch of the public favour; and she had no intellectual superiority to\nmake atonement to herself, or frighten those who might hate her into\noutward respect. She had never boasted either beauty or cleverness. Her\nyouth had passed without distinction, and her middle of life was devoted\nto the care of a failing mother, and the endeavour to make a small\nincome go as far as possible. And yet she was a happy woman, and a woman\nwhom no one named without good-will. It was her own universal good-will\nand contented temper which worked such wonders. She loved every body,\nwas interested in every body's happiness, quicksighted to every body's\nmerits; thought herself a most fortunate creature, and surrounded with\nblessings in such an excellent mother, and so many good neighbours\nand friends, and a home that wanted for nothing. The simplicity and\ncheerfulness of her nature, her contented and grateful spirit, were a\nrecommendation to every body, and a mine of felicity to herself. She was\na great talker upon little matters, which exactly suited Mr. Woodhouse,\nfull of trivial communications and harmless gossip.\n\nMrs. Goddard was the mistress of a School--not of a seminary, or an\nestablishment, or any thing which professed, in long sentences of\nrefined nonsense, to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality,\nupon new principles and new systems--and where young ladies for enormous\npay might be screwed out of health and into vanity--but a real,\nhonest, old-fashioned Boarding-school, where a reasonable quantity of\naccomplishments were sold at a reasonable price, and where girls might\nbe sent to be out of the way, and scramble themselves into a little\neducation, without any danger of coming back prodigies. Mrs. Goddard's\nschool was in high repute--and very deservedly; for Highbury was\nreckoned a particularly healthy spot: she had an ample house and garden,\ngave the children plenty of wholesome food, let them run about a great\ndeal in the summer, and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own\nhands. It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked\nafter her to church. She was a plain, motherly kind of woman, who\nhad worked hard in her youth, and now thought herself entitled to the\noccasional holiday of a tea-visit; and having formerly owed much to Mr.\nWoodhouse's kindness, felt his particular claim on her to leave her neat\nparlour, hung round with fancy-work, whenever she could, and win or lose\na few sixpences by his fireside.\n\nThese were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently able to\ncollect; and happy was she, for her father's sake, in the power; though,\nas far as she was herself concerned, it was no remedy for the absence of\nMrs. Weston. She was delighted to see her father look comfortable, and\nvery much pleased with herself for contriving things so well; but the\nquiet prosings of three such women made her feel that every evening so\nspent was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated.\n\nAs she sat one morning, looking forward to exactly such a close of the\npresent day, a note was brought from Mrs. Goddard, requesting, in most\nrespectful terms, to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her; a most\nwelcome request: for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen, whom Emma knew\nvery well by sight, and had long felt an interest in, on account of\nher beauty. A very gracious invitation was returned, and the evening no\nlonger dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion.\n\nHarriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody. Somebody had placed\nher, several years back, at Mrs. Goddard's school, and somebody\nhad lately raised her from the condition of scholar to that of\nparlour-boarder. This was all that was generally known of her history.\nShe had no visible friends but what had been acquired at Highbury, and\nwas now just returned from a long visit in the country to some young\nladies who had been at school there with her.\n\nShe was a very pretty girl, and her beauty happened to be of a sort\nwhich Emma particularly admired. She was short, plump, and fair, with a\nfine bloom, blue eyes, light hair, regular features, and a look of great\nsweetness, and, before the end of the evening, Emma was as much pleased\nwith her manners as her person, and quite determined to continue the\nacquaintance.\n\nShe was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith's\nconversation, but she found her altogether very engaging--not\ninconveniently shy, not unwilling to talk--and yet so far from pushing,\nshewing so proper and becoming a deference, seeming so pleasantly\ngrateful for being admitted to Hartfield, and so artlessly impressed\nby the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had\nbeen used to, that she must have good sense, and deserve encouragement.\nEncouragement should be given. Those soft blue eyes, and all those\nnatural graces, should not be wasted on the inferior society of Highbury\nand its connexions. The acquaintance she had already formed were\nunworthy of her. The friends from whom she had just parted, though very\ngood sort of people, must be doing her harm. They were a family of the\nname of Martin, whom Emma well knew by character, as renting a large\nfarm of Mr. Knightley, and residing in the parish of Donwell--very\ncreditably, she believed--she knew Mr. Knightley thought highly of\nthem--but they must be coarse and unpolished, and very unfit to be the\nintimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance\nto be quite perfect. _She_ would notice her; she would improve her; she\nwould detach her from her bad acquaintance, and introduce her into good\nsociety; she would form her opinions and her manners. It would be an\ninteresting, and certainly a very kind undertaking; highly becoming her\nown situation in life, her leisure, and powers.\n\nShe was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes, in talking and\nlistening, and forming all these schemes in the in-betweens, that the\nevening flew away at a very unusual rate; and the supper-table, which\nalways closed such parties, and for which she had been used to sit and\nwatch the due time, was all set out and ready, and moved forwards to the\nfire, before she was aware. With an alacrity beyond the common impulse\nof a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of doing every\nthing well and attentively, with the real good-will of a mind delighted\nwith its own ideas, did she then do all the honours of the meal, and\nhelp and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped oysters, with an\nurgency which she knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil\nscruples of their guests.\n\nUpon such occasions poor Mr. Woodhouse's feelings were in sad warfare.\nHe loved to have the cloth laid, because it had been the fashion of his\nyouth, but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him\nrather sorry to see any thing put on it; and while his hospitality would\nhave welcomed his visitors to every thing, his care for their health\nmade him grieve that they would eat.\n\nSuch another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could,\nwith thorough self-approbation, recommend; though he might constrain\nhimself, while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things, to\nsay:\n\n“Mrs. Bates, let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs. An egg\nboiled very soft is not unwholesome. Serle understands boiling an egg\nbetter than any body. I would not recommend an egg boiled by any body\nelse; but you need not be afraid, they are very small, you see--one of\nour small eggs will not hurt you. Miss Bates, let Emma help you to a\n_little_ bit of tart--a _very_ little bit. Ours are all apple-tarts. You\nneed not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here. I do not advise the\ncustard. Mrs. Goddard, what say you to _half_ a glass of wine? A\n_small_ half-glass, put into a tumbler of water? I do not think it could\ndisagree with you.”\n\nEmma allowed her father to talk--but supplied her visitors in a much\nmore satisfactory style, and on the present evening had particular\npleasure in sending them away happy. The happiness of Miss Smith was\nquite equal to her intentions. Miss Woodhouse was so great a personage\nin Highbury, that the prospect of the introduction had given as much\npanic as pleasure; but the humble, grateful little girl went off with\nhighly gratified feelings, delighted with the affability with which Miss\nWoodhouse had treated her all the evening, and actually shaken hands\nwith her at last!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nHarriet Smith's intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing. Quick\nand decided in her ways, Emma lost no time in inviting, encouraging, and\ntelling her to come very often; and as their acquaintance increased, so\ndid their satisfaction in each other. As a walking companion, Emma had\nvery early foreseen how useful she might find her. In that respect\nMrs. Weston's loss had been important. Her father never went beyond the\nshrubbery, where two divisions of the ground sufficed him for his long\nwalk, or his short, as the year varied; and since Mrs. Weston's marriage\nher exercise had been too much confined. She had ventured once alone to\nRandalls, but it was not pleasant; and a Harriet Smith, therefore,\none whom she could summon at any time to a walk, would be a valuable\naddition to her privileges. But in every respect, as she saw more of\nher, she approved her, and was confirmed in all her kind designs.\n\nHarriet certainly was not clever, but she had a sweet, docile, grateful\ndisposition, was totally free from conceit, and only desiring to be\nguided by any one she looked up to. Her early attachment to herself\nwas very amiable; and her inclination for good company, and power of\nappreciating what was elegant and clever, shewed that there was no\nwant of taste, though strength of understanding must not be expected.\nAltogether she was quite convinced of Harriet Smith's being exactly the\nyoung friend she wanted--exactly the something which her home required.\nSuch a friend as Mrs. Weston was out of the question. Two such could\nnever be granted. Two such she did not want. It was quite a different\nsort of thing, a sentiment distinct and independent. Mrs. Weston was the\nobject of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem. Harriet\nwould be loved as one to whom she could be useful. For Mrs. Weston there\nwas nothing to be done; for Harriet every thing.\n\nHer first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who\nwere the parents, but Harriet could not tell. She was ready to tell\nevery thing in her power, but on this subject questions were vain. Emma\nwas obliged to fancy what she liked--but she could never believe that in\nthe same situation _she_ should not have discovered the truth. Harriet\nhad no penetration. She had been satisfied to hear and believe just what\nMrs. Goddard chose to tell her; and looked no farther.\n\nMrs. Goddard, and the teachers, and the girls and the affairs of\nthe school in general, formed naturally a great part of the\nconversation--and but for her acquaintance with the Martins of\nAbbey-Mill Farm, it must have been the whole. But the Martins occupied\nher thoughts a good deal; she had spent two very happy months with them,\nand now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit, and describe\nthe many comforts and wonders of the place. Emma encouraged her\ntalkativeness--amused by such a picture of another set of beings,\nand enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much\nexultation of Mrs. Martin's having “_two_ parlours, two very good\nparlours, indeed; one of them quite as large as Mrs. Goddard's\ndrawing-room; and of her having an upper maid who had lived\nfive-and-twenty years with her; and of their having eight cows, two of\nthem Alderneys, and one a little Welch cow, a very pretty little Welch\ncow indeed; and of Mrs. Martin's saying as she was so fond of it,\nit should be called _her_ cow; and of their having a very handsome\nsummer-house in their garden, where some day next year they were all to\ndrink tea:--a very handsome summer-house, large enough to hold a dozen\npeople.”\n\nFor some time she was amused, without thinking beyond the immediate\ncause; but as she came to understand the family better, other feelings\narose. She had taken up a wrong idea, fancying it was a mother and\ndaughter, a son and son's wife, who all lived together; but when it\nappeared that the Mr. Martin, who bore a part in the narrative, and was\nalways mentioned with approbation for his great good-nature in doing\nsomething or other, was a single man; that there was no young Mrs.\nMartin, no wife in the case; she did suspect danger to her poor little\nfriend from all this hospitality and kindness, and that, if she were not\ntaken care of, she might be required to sink herself forever.\n\nWith this inspiriting notion, her questions increased in number and\nmeaning; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr. Martin,\nand there was evidently no dislike to it. Harriet was very ready to\nspeak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry evening\ngames; and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very good-humoured and\nobliging. He had gone three miles round one day in order to bring her\nsome walnuts, because she had said how fond she was of them, and in\nevery thing else he was so very obliging. He had his shepherd's son into\nthe parlour one night on purpose to sing to her. She was very fond\nof singing. He could sing a little himself. She believed he was very\nclever, and understood every thing. He had a very fine flock, and, while\nshe was with them, he had been bid more for his wool than any body in\nthe country. She believed every body spoke well of him. His mother and\nsisters were very fond of him. Mrs. Martin had told her one day (and\nthere was a blush as she said it,) that it was impossible for any body\nto be a better son, and therefore she was sure, whenever he married, he\nwould make a good husband. Not that she _wanted_ him to marry. She was\nin no hurry at all.\n\n“Well done, Mrs. Martin!” thought Emma. “You know what you are about.”\n\n“And when she had come away, Mrs. Martin was so very kind as to send\nMrs. Goddard a beautiful goose--the finest goose Mrs. Goddard had ever\nseen. Mrs. Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday, and asked all the three\nteachers, Miss Nash, and Miss Prince, and Miss Richardson, to sup with\nher.”\n\n“Mr. Martin, I suppose, is not a man of information beyond the line of\nhis own business? He does not read?”\n\n“Oh yes!--that is, no--I do not know--but I believe he has read a\ngood deal--but not what you would think any thing of. He reads the\nAgricultural Reports, and some other books that lay in one of the window\nseats--but he reads all _them_ to himself. But sometimes of an evening,\nbefore we went to cards, he would read something aloud out of the\nElegant Extracts, very entertaining. And I know he has read the Vicar of\nWakefield. He never read the Romance of the Forest, nor The Children of\nthe Abbey. He had never heard of such books before I mentioned them, but\nhe is determined to get them now as soon as ever he can.”\n\nThe next question was--\n\n“What sort of looking man is Mr. Martin?”\n\n“Oh! not handsome--not at all handsome. I thought him very plain at\nfirst, but I do not think him so plain now. One does not, you know,\nafter a time. But did you never see him? He is in Highbury every now and\nthen, and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to Kingston.\nHe has passed you very often.”\n\n“That may be, and I may have seen him fifty times, but without having\nany idea of his name. A young farmer, whether on horseback or on foot,\nis the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity. The yeomanry are\nprecisely the order of people with whom I feel I can have nothing to do.\nA degree or two lower, and a creditable appearance might interest me;\nI might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other. But\na farmer can need none of my help, and is, therefore, in one sense, as\nmuch above my notice as in every other he is below it.”\n\n“To be sure. Oh yes! It is not likely you should ever have observed him;\nbut he knows you very well indeed--I mean by sight.”\n\n“I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man. I know,\nindeed, that he is so, and, as such, wish him well. What do you imagine\nhis age to be?”\n\n“He was four-and-twenty the 8th of last June, and my birthday is the\n23rd just a fortnight and a day's difference--which is very odd.”\n\n“Only four-and-twenty. That is too young to settle. His mother is\nperfectly right not to be in a hurry. They seem very comfortable as they\nare, and if she were to take any pains to marry him, she would probably\nrepent it. Six years hence, if he could meet with a good sort of young\nwoman in the same rank as his own, with a little money, it might be very\ndesirable.”\n\n“Six years hence! Dear Miss Woodhouse, he would be thirty years old!”\n\n“Well, and that is as early as most men can afford to marry, who are not\nborn to an independence. Mr. Martin, I imagine, has his fortune entirely\nto make--cannot be at all beforehand with the world. Whatever money he\nmight come into when his father died, whatever his share of the family\nproperty, it is, I dare say, all afloat, all employed in his stock, and\nso forth; and though, with diligence and good luck, he may be rich in\ntime, it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thing\nyet.”\n\n“To be sure, so it is. But they live very comfortably. They have no\nindoors man, else they do not want for any thing; and Mrs. Martin talks\nof taking a boy another year.”\n\n“I wish you may not get into a scrape, Harriet, whenever he does\nmarry;--I mean, as to being acquainted with his wife--for though his\nsisters, from a superior education, are not to be altogether objected\nto, it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you\nto notice. The misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly\ncareful as to your associates. There can be no doubt of your being a\ngentleman's daughter, and you must support your claim to that station by\nevery thing within your own power, or there will be plenty of people who\nwould take pleasure in degrading you.”\n\n“Yes, to be sure, I suppose there are. But while I visit at Hartfield,\nand you are so kind to me, Miss Woodhouse, I am not afraid of what any\nbody can do.”\n\n“You understand the force of influence pretty well, Harriet; but I would\nhave you so firmly established in good society, as to be independent\neven of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse. I want to see you permanently\nwell connected, and to that end it will be advisable to have as few odd\nacquaintance as may be; and, therefore, I say that if you should still\nbe in this country when Mr. Martin marries, I wish you may not be drawn\nin by your intimacy with the sisters, to be acquainted with the wife,\nwho will probably be some mere farmer's daughter, without education.”\n\n“To be sure. Yes. Not that I think Mr. Martin would ever marry any body\nbut what had had some education--and been very well brought up. However,\nI do not mean to set up my opinion against yours--and I am sure I shall\nnot wish for the acquaintance of his wife. I shall always have a great\nregard for the Miss Martins, especially Elizabeth, and should be very\nsorry to give them up, for they are quite as well educated as me. But\nif he marries a very ignorant, vulgar woman, certainly I had better not\nvisit her, if I can help it.”\n\nEmma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech, and saw no\nalarming symptoms of love. The young man had been the first admirer, but\nshe trusted there was no other hold, and that there would be no serious\ndifficulty, on Harriet's side, to oppose any friendly arrangement of her\nown.\n\nThey met Mr. Martin the very next day, as they were walking on the\nDonwell road. He was on foot, and after looking very respectfully at\nher, looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion. Emma was\nnot sorry to have such an opportunity of survey; and walking a few\nyards forward, while they talked together, soon made her quick eye\nsufficiently acquainted with Mr. Robert Martin. His appearance was very\nneat, and he looked like a sensible young man, but his person had no\nother advantage; and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen,\nshe thought he must lose all the ground he had gained in Harriet's\ninclination. Harriet was not insensible of manner; she had voluntarily\nnoticed her father's gentleness with admiration as well as wonder. Mr.\nMartin looked as if he did not know what manner was.\n\nThey remained but a few minutes together, as Miss Woodhouse must not be\nkept waiting; and Harriet then came running to her with a smiling face,\nand in a flutter of spirits, which Miss Woodhouse hoped very soon to\ncompose.\n\n“Only think of our happening to meet him!--How very odd! It was quite\na chance, he said, that he had not gone round by Randalls. He did not\nthink we ever walked this road. He thought we walked towards Randalls\nmost days. He has not been able to get the Romance of the Forest yet.\nHe was so busy the last time he was at Kingston that he quite forgot it,\nbut he goes again to-morrow. So very odd we should happen to meet! Well,\nMiss Woodhouse, is he like what you expected? What do you think of him?\nDo you think him so very plain?”\n\n“He is very plain, undoubtedly--remarkably plain:--but that is nothing\ncompared with his entire want of gentility. I had no right to expect\nmuch, and I did not expect much; but I had no idea that he could be so\nvery clownish, so totally without air. I had imagined him, I confess, a\ndegree or two nearer gentility.”\n\n“To be sure,” said Harriet, in a mortified voice, “he is not so genteel\nas real gentlemen.”\n\n“I think, Harriet, since your acquaintance with us, you have been\nrepeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen, that you\nmust yourself be struck with the difference in Mr. Martin. At Hartfield,\nyou have had very good specimens of well educated, well bred men. I\nshould be surprized if, after seeing them, you could be in company\nwith Mr. Martin again without perceiving him to be a very inferior\ncreature--and rather wondering at yourself for having ever thought him\nat all agreeable before. Do not you begin to feel that now? Were not\nyou struck? I am sure you must have been struck by his awkward look and\nabrupt manner, and the uncouthness of a voice which I heard to be wholly\nunmodulated as I stood here.”\n\n“Certainly, he is not like Mr. Knightley. He has not such a fine air and\nway of walking as Mr. Knightley. I see the difference plain enough. But\nMr. Knightley is so very fine a man!”\n\n“Mr. Knightley's air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to\ncompare Mr. Martin with _him_. You might not see one in a hundred with\n_gentleman_ so plainly written as in Mr. Knightley. But he is not the\nonly gentleman you have been lately used to. What say you to Mr. Weston\nand Mr. Elton? Compare Mr. Martin with either of _them_. Compare their\nmanner of carrying themselves; of walking; of speaking; of being silent.\nYou must see the difference.”\n\n“Oh yes!--there is a great difference. But Mr. Weston is almost an old\nman. Mr. Weston must be between forty and fifty.”\n\n“Which makes his good manners the more valuable. The older a person\ngrows, Harriet, the more important it is that their manners should not\nbe bad; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness, or coarseness, or\nawkwardness becomes. What is passable in youth is detestable in later\nage. Mr. Martin is now awkward and abrupt; what will he be at Mr.\nWeston's time of life?”\n\n“There is no saying, indeed,” replied Harriet rather solemnly.\n\n“But there may be pretty good guessing. He will be a completely gross,\nvulgar farmer, totally inattentive to appearances, and thinking of\nnothing but profit and loss.”\n\n“Will he, indeed? That will be very bad.”\n\n“How much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the\ncircumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended.\nHe was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing\nelse--which is just as it should be, for a thriving man. What has he to\ndo with books? And I have no doubt that he _will_ thrive, and be a very\nrich man in time--and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb\n_us_.”\n\n“I wonder he did not remember the book”--was all Harriet's answer, and\nspoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might be\nsafely left to itself. She, therefore, said no more for some time. Her\nnext beginning was,\n\n“In one respect, perhaps, Mr. Elton's manners are superior to Mr.\nKnightley's or Mr. Weston's. They have more gentleness. They might be\nmore safely held up as a pattern. There is an openness, a quickness,\nalmost a bluntness in Mr. Weston, which every body likes in _him_,\nbecause there is so much good-humour with it--but that would not do to\nbe copied. Neither would Mr. Knightley's downright, decided, commanding\nsort of manner, though it suits _him_ very well; his figure, and look,\nand situation in life seem to allow it; but if any young man were to set\nabout copying him, he would not be sufferable. On the contrary, I think\na young man might be very safely recommended to take Mr. Elton as a\nmodel. Mr. Elton is good-humoured, cheerful, obliging, and gentle.\nHe seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late. I do not know\nwhether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us,\nHarriet, by additional softness, but it strikes me that his manners are\nsofter than they used to be. If he means any thing, it must be to please\nyou. Did not I tell you what he said of you the other day?”\n\nShe then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from Mr.\nElton, and now did full justice to; and Harriet blushed and smiled, and\nsaid she had always thought Mr. Elton very agreeable.\n\nMr. Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving the young\nfarmer out of Harriet's head. She thought it would be an excellent\nmatch; and only too palpably desirable, natural, and probable, for her\nto have much merit in planning it. She feared it was what every body\nelse must think of and predict. It was not likely, however, that any\nbody should have equalled her in the date of the plan, as it had\nentered her brain during the very first evening of Harriet's coming to\nHartfield. The longer she considered it, the greater was her sense\nof its expediency. Mr. Elton's situation was most suitable, quite the\ngentleman himself, and without low connexions; at the same time, not of\nany family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of Harriet.\nHe had a comfortable home for her, and Emma imagined a very sufficient\nincome; for though the vicarage of Highbury was not large, he was known\nto have some independent property; and she thought very highly of him\nas a good-humoured, well-meaning, respectable young man, without any\ndeficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world.\n\nShe had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a beautiful\ngirl, which she trusted, with such frequent meetings at Hartfield, was\nfoundation enough on his side; and on Harriet's there could be little\ndoubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual\nweight and efficacy. And he was really a very pleasing young man, a\nyoung man whom any woman not fastidious might like. He was reckoned very\nhandsome; his person much admired in general, though not by her,\nthere being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense\nwith:--but the girl who could be gratified by a Robert Martin's riding\nabout the country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered by\nMr. Elton's admiration.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\n“I do not know what your opinion may be, Mrs. Weston,” said Mr.\nKnightley, “of this great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith, but I\nthink it a bad thing.”\n\n“A bad thing! Do you really think it a bad thing?--why so?”\n\n“I think they will neither of them do the other any good.”\n\n“You surprize me! Emma must do Harriet good: and by supplying her with a\nnew object of interest, Harriet may be said to do Emma good. I have been\nseeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure. How very differently\nwe feel!--Not think they will do each other any good! This will\ncertainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about Emma, Mr.\nKnightley.”\n\n“Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you, knowing\nWeston to be out, and that you must still fight your own battle.”\n\n“Mr. Weston would undoubtedly support me, if he were here, for he thinks\nexactly as I do on the subject. We were speaking of it only yesterday,\nand agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma, that there should be such a\ngirl in Highbury for her to associate with. Mr. Knightley, I shall not\nallow you to be a fair judge in this case. You are so much used to live\nalone, that you do not know the value of a companion; and, perhaps no\nman can be a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of\none of her own sex, after being used to it all her life. I can imagine\nyour objection to Harriet Smith. She is not the superior young woman\nwhich Emma's friend ought to be. But on the other hand, as Emma wants\nto see her better informed, it will be an inducement to her to read more\nherself. They will read together. She means it, I know.”\n\n“Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old.\nI have seen a great many lists of her drawing-up at various times of\nbooks that she meant to read regularly through--and very good lists\nthey were--very well chosen, and very neatly arranged--sometimes\nalphabetically, and sometimes by some other rule. The list she drew\nup when only fourteen--I remember thinking it did her judgment so much\ncredit, that I preserved it some time; and I dare say she may have made\nout a very good list now. But I have done with expecting any course of\nsteady reading from Emma. She will never submit to any thing\nrequiring industry and patience, and a subjection of the fancy to the\nunderstanding. Where Miss Taylor failed to stimulate, I may safely\naffirm that Harriet Smith will do nothing.--You never could persuade her\nto read half so much as you wished.--You know you could not.”\n\n“I dare say,” replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, “that I thought so\n_then_;--but since we have parted, I can never remember Emma's omitting\nto do any thing I wished.”\n\n“There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as _that_,”--said\nMr. Knightley, feelingly; and for a moment or two he had done. “But I,”\n he soon added, “who have had no such charm thrown over my senses, must\nstill see, hear, and remember. Emma is spoiled by being the cleverest\nof her family. At ten years old, she had the misfortune of being able to\nanswer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen. She was always\nquick and assured: Isabella slow and diffident. And ever since she\nwas twelve, Emma has been mistress of the house and of you all. In her\nmother she lost the only person able to cope with her. She inherits her\nmother's talents, and must have been under subjection to her.”\n\n“I should have been sorry, Mr. Knightley, to be dependent on _your_\nrecommendation, had I quitted Mr. Woodhouse's family and wanted another\nsituation; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to\nany body. I am sure you always thought me unfit for the office I held.”\n\n“Yes,” said he, smiling. “You are better placed _here_; very fit for a\nwife, but not at all for a governess. But you were preparing yourself to\nbe an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield. You might\nnot give Emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to\npromise; but you were receiving a very good education from _her_, on the\nvery material matrimonial point of submitting your own will, and doing\nas you were bid; and if Weston had asked me to recommend him a wife, I\nshould certainly have named Miss Taylor.”\n\n“Thank you. There will be very little merit in making a good wife to\nsuch a man as Mr. Weston.”\n\n“Why, to own the truth, I am afraid you are rather thrown away, and that\nwith every disposition to bear, there will be nothing to be borne. We\nwill not despair, however. Weston may grow cross from the wantonness of\ncomfort, or his son may plague him.”\n\n“I hope not _that_.--It is not likely. No, Mr. Knightley, do not\nforetell vexation from that quarter.”\n\n“Not I, indeed. I only name possibilities. I do not pretend to Emma's\ngenius for foretelling and guessing. I hope, with all my heart, the\nyoung man may be a Weston in merit, and a Churchill in fortune.--But\nHarriet Smith--I have not half done about Harriet Smith. I think her the\nvery worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have. She knows\nnothing herself, and looks upon Emma as knowing every thing. She is a\nflatterer in all her ways; and so much the worse, because undesigned.\nHer ignorance is hourly flattery. How can Emma imagine she has any\nthing to learn herself, while Harriet is presenting such a delightful\ninferiority? And as for Harriet, I will venture to say that _she_ cannot\ngain by the acquaintance. Hartfield will only put her out of conceit\nwith all the other places she belongs to. She will grow just refined\nenough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstances\nhave placed her home. I am much mistaken if Emma's doctrines give any\nstrength of mind, or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally\nto the varieties of her situation in life.--They only give a little\npolish.”\n\n“I either depend more upon Emma's good sense than you do, or am more\nanxious for her present comfort; for I cannot lament the acquaintance.\nHow well she looked last night!”\n\n“Oh! you would rather talk of her person than her mind, would you? Very\nwell; I shall not attempt to deny Emma's being pretty.”\n\n“Pretty! say beautiful rather. Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect\nbeauty than Emma altogether--face and figure?”\n\n“I do not know what I could imagine, but I confess that I have seldom\nseen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers. But I am a partial\nold friend.”\n\n“Such an eye!--the true hazle eye--and so brilliant! regular features,\nopen countenance, with a complexion! oh! what a bloom of full health,\nand such a pretty height and size; such a firm and upright figure!\nThere is health, not merely in her bloom, but in her air, her head, her\nglance. One hears sometimes of a child being 'the picture of health;'\nnow, Emma always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of\ngrown-up health. She is loveliness itself. Mr. Knightley, is not she?”\n\n“I have not a fault to find with her person,” he replied. “I think her\nall you describe. I love to look at her; and I will add this praise,\nthat I do not think her personally vain. Considering how very handsome\nshe is, she appears to be little occupied with it; her vanity lies\nanother way. Mrs. Weston, I am not to be talked out of my dislike of\nHarriet Smith, or my dread of its doing them both harm.”\n\n“And I, Mr. Knightley, am equally stout in my confidence of its not\ndoing them any harm. With all dear Emma's little faults, she is an\nexcellent creature. Where shall we see a better daughter, or a kinder\nsister, or a truer friend? No, no; she has qualities which may be\ntrusted; she will never lead any one really wrong; she will make no\nlasting blunder; where Emma errs once, she is in the right a hundred\ntimes.”\n\n“Very well; I will not plague you any more. Emma shall be an angel, and\nI will keep my spleen to myself till Christmas brings John and Isabella.\nJohn loves Emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind affection,\nand Isabella always thinks as he does; except when he is not quite\nfrightened enough about the children. I am sure of having their opinions\nwith me.”\n\n“I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind;\nbut excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if I take the liberty (I consider myself,\nyou know, as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma's\nmother might have had) the liberty of hinting that I do not think any\npossible good can arise from Harriet Smith's intimacy being made a\nmatter of much discussion among you. Pray excuse me; but supposing any\nlittle inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy, it cannot be\nexpected that Emma, accountable to nobody but her father, who perfectly\napproves the acquaintance, should put an end to it, so long as it is a\nsource of pleasure to herself. It has been so many years my province to\ngive advice, that you cannot be surprized, Mr. Knightley, at this little\nremains of office.”\n\n“Not at all,” cried he; “I am much obliged to you for it. It is very\ngood advice, and it shall have a better fate than your advice has often\nfound; for it shall be attended to.”\n\n“Mrs. John Knightley is easily alarmed, and might be made unhappy about\nher sister.”\n\n“Be satisfied,” said he, “I will not raise any outcry. I will keep my\nill-humour to myself. I have a very sincere interest in Emma. Isabella\ndoes not seem more my sister; has never excited a greater interest;\nperhaps hardly so great. There is an anxiety, a curiosity in what one\nfeels for Emma. I wonder what will become of her!”\n\n“So do I,” said Mrs. Weston gently, “very much.”\n\n“She always declares she will never marry, which, of course, means just\nnothing at all. But I have no idea that she has yet ever seen a man she\ncared for. It would not be a bad thing for her to be very much in love\nwith a proper object. I should like to see Emma in love, and in some\ndoubt of a return; it would do her good. But there is nobody hereabouts\nto attach her; and she goes so seldom from home.”\n\n“There does, indeed, seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution\nat present,” said Mrs. Weston, “as can well be; and while she is so\nhappy at Hartfield, I cannot wish her to be forming any attachment which\nwould be creating such difficulties on poor Mr. Woodhouse's account. I\ndo not recommend matrimony at present to Emma, though I mean no slight\nto the state, I assure you.”\n\nPart of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her own\nand Mr. Weston's on the subject, as much as possible. There were wishes\nat Randalls respecting Emma's destiny, but it was not desirable to\nhave them suspected; and the quiet transition which Mr. Knightley soon\nafterwards made to “What does Weston think of the weather; shall we have\nrain?” convinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmise about\nHartfield.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nEmma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet's fancy a proper\ndirection and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good\npurpose, for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of Mr.\nElton's being a remarkably handsome man, with most agreeable manners;\nand as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his\nadmiration by agreeable hints, she was soon pretty confident of creating\nas much liking on Harriet's side, as there could be any occasion for.\nShe was quite convinced of Mr. Elton's being in the fairest way of\nfalling in love, if not in love already. She had no scruple with regard\nto him. He talked of Harriet, and praised her so warmly, that she could\nnot suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add. His\nperception of the striking improvement of Harriet's manner, since her\nintroduction at Hartfield, was not one of the least agreeable proofs of\nhis growing attachment.\n\n“You have given Miss Smith all that she required,” said he; “you have\nmade her graceful and easy. She was a beautiful creature when she\ncame to you, but, in my opinion, the attractions you have added are\ninfinitely superior to what she received from nature.”\n\n“I am glad you think I have been useful to her; but Harriet only wanted\ndrawing out, and receiving a few, very few hints. She had all the\nnatural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself. I have\ndone very little.”\n\n“If it were admissible to contradict a lady,” said the gallant Mr.\nElton--\n\n“I have perhaps given her a little more decision of character, have\ntaught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before.”\n\n“Exactly so; that is what principally strikes me. So much superadded\ndecision of character! Skilful has been the hand!”\n\n“Great has been the pleasure, I am sure. I never met with a disposition\nmore truly amiable.”\n\n“I have no doubt of it.” And it was spoken with a sort of sighing\nanimation, which had a vast deal of the lover. She was not less pleased\nanother day with the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers,\nto have Harriet's picture.\n\n“Did you ever have your likeness taken, Harriet?” said she: “did you\never sit for your picture?”\n\nHarriet was on the point of leaving the room, and only stopt to say,\nwith a very interesting naivete,\n\n“Oh! dear, no, never.”\n\nNo sooner was she out of sight, than Emma exclaimed,\n\n“What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be! I would\ngive any money for it. I almost long to attempt her likeness myself.\nYou do not know it I dare say, but two or three years ago I had a great\npassion for taking likenesses, and attempted several of my friends, and\nwas thought to have a tolerable eye in general. But from one cause or\nanother, I gave it up in disgust. But really, I could almost venture,\nif Harriet would sit to me. It would be such a delight to have her\npicture!”\n\n“Let me entreat you,” cried Mr. Elton; “it would indeed be a delight!\nLet me entreat you, Miss Woodhouse, to exercise so charming a talent\nin favour of your friend. I know what your drawings are. How could\nyou suppose me ignorant? Is not this room rich in specimens of your\nlandscapes and flowers; and has not Mrs. Weston some inimitable\nfigure-pieces in her drawing-room, at Randalls?”\n\nYes, good man!--thought Emma--but what has all that to do with taking\nlikenesses? You know nothing of drawing. Don't pretend to be in raptures\nabout mine. Keep your raptures for Harriet's face. “Well, if you give me\nsuch kind encouragement, Mr. Elton, I believe I shall try what I can do.\nHarriet's features are very delicate, which makes a likeness difficult;\nand yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of the eye and the lines\nabout the mouth which one ought to catch.”\n\n“Exactly so--The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth--I have\nnot a doubt of your success. Pray, pray attempt it. As you will do it,\nit will indeed, to use your own words, be an exquisite possession.”\n\n“But I am afraid, Mr. Elton, Harriet will not like to sit. She thinks\nso little of her own beauty. Did not you observe her manner of answering\nme? How completely it meant, 'why should my picture be drawn?'”\n\n“Oh! yes, I observed it, I assure you. It was not lost on me. But still\nI cannot imagine she would not be persuaded.”\n\nHarriet was soon back again, and the proposal almost immediately made;\nand she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the\nearnest pressing of both the others. Emma wished to go to work directly,\nand therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts at\nportraits, for not one of them had ever been finished, that they might\ndecide together on the best size for Harriet. Her many beginnings were\ndisplayed. Miniatures, half-lengths, whole-lengths, pencil, crayon, and\nwater-colours had been all tried in turn. She had always wanted to do\nevery thing, and had made more progress both in drawing and music than\nmany might have done with so little labour as she would ever submit to.\nShe played and sang;--and drew in almost every style; but steadiness\nhad always been wanting; and in nothing had she approached the degree of\nexcellence which she would have been glad to command, and ought not to\nhave failed of. She was not much deceived as to her own skill either\nas an artist or a musician, but she was not unwilling to have others\ndeceived, or sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often\nhigher than it deserved.\n\nThere was merit in every drawing--in the least finished, perhaps the\nmost; her style was spirited; but had there been much less, or had there\nbeen ten times more, the delight and admiration of her two companions\nwould have been the same. They were both in ecstasies. A likeness\npleases every body; and Miss Woodhouse's performances must be capital.\n\n“No great variety of faces for you,” said Emma. “I had only my own\nfamily to study from. There is my father--another of my father--but the\nidea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous, that I could only\ntake him by stealth; neither of them very like therefore. Mrs. Weston\nagain, and again, and again, you see. Dear Mrs. Weston! always my\nkindest friend on every occasion. She would sit whenever I asked her.\nThere is my sister; and really quite her own little elegant figure!--and\nthe face not unlike. I should have made a good likeness of her, if she\nwould have sat longer, but she was in such a hurry to have me draw\nher four children that she would not be quiet. Then, here come all my\nattempts at three of those four children;--there they are, Henry and\nJohn and Bella, from one end of the sheet to the other, and any one of\nthem might do for any one of the rest. She was so eager to have them\ndrawn that I could not refuse; but there is no making children of three\nor four years old stand still you know; nor can it be very easy to take\nany likeness of them, beyond the air and complexion, unless they are\ncoarser featured than any of mama's children ever were. Here is my\nsketch of the fourth, who was a baby. I took him as he was sleeping on\nthe sofa, and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would\nwish to see. He had nestled down his head most conveniently. That's very\nlike. I am rather proud of little George. The corner of the sofa is very\ngood. Then here is my last,”--unclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman\nin small size, whole-length--“my last and my best--my brother, Mr. John\nKnightley.--This did not want much of being finished, when I put it away\nin a pet, and vowed I would never take another likeness. I could not\nhelp being provoked; for after all my pains, and when I had really made\na very good likeness of it--(Mrs. Weston and I were quite agreed in\nthinking it _very_ like)--only too handsome--too flattering--but\nthat was a fault on the right side”--after all this, came poor dear\nIsabella's cold approbation of--“Yes, it was a little like--but to be\nsure it did not do him justice. We had had a great deal of trouble\nin persuading him to sit at all. It was made a great favour of; and\naltogether it was more than I could bear; and so I never would finish\nit, to have it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness, to every\nmorning visitor in Brunswick Square;--and, as I said, I did then\nforswear ever drawing any body again. But for Harriet's sake, or rather\nfor my own, and as there are no husbands and wives in the case _at_\n_present_, I will break my resolution now.”\n\nMr. Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea, and was\nrepeating, “No husbands and wives in the case at present indeed, as\nyou observe. Exactly so. No husbands and wives,” with so interesting a\nconsciousness, that Emma began to consider whether she had not better\nleave them together at once. But as she wanted to be drawing, the\ndeclaration must wait a little longer.\n\nShe had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait. It was to be\na whole-length in water-colours, like Mr. John Knightley's, and was\ndestined, if she could please herself, to hold a very honourable station\nover the mantelpiece.\n\nThe sitting began; and Harriet, smiling and blushing, and afraid of not\nkeeping her attitude and countenance, presented a very sweet mixture of\nyouthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist. But there was no\ndoing any thing, with Mr. Elton fidgeting behind her and watching every\ntouch. She gave him credit for stationing himself where he might gaze\nand gaze again without offence; but was really obliged to put an end to\nit, and request him to place himself elsewhere. It then occurred to her\nto employ him in reading.\n\n“If he would be so good as to read to them, it would be a kindness\nindeed! It would amuse away the difficulties of her part, and lessen the\nirksomeness of Miss Smith's.”\n\nMr. Elton was only too happy. Harriet listened, and Emma drew in peace.\nShe must allow him to be still frequently coming to look; any thing less\nwould certainly have been too little in a lover; and he was ready at the\nsmallest intermission of the pencil, to jump up and see the progress,\nand be charmed.--There was no being displeased with such an encourager,\nfor his admiration made him discern a likeness almost before it\nwas possible. She could not respect his eye, but his love and his\ncomplaisance were unexceptionable.\n\nThe sitting was altogether very satisfactory; she was quite enough\npleased with the first day's sketch to wish to go on. There was no want\nof likeness, she had been fortunate in the attitude, and as she meant\nto throw in a little improvement to the figure, to give a little more\nheight, and considerably more elegance, she had great confidence of\nits being in every way a pretty drawing at last, and of its filling\nits destined place with credit to them both--a standing memorial of the\nbeauty of one, the skill of the other, and the friendship of both;\nwith as many other agreeable associations as Mr. Elton's very promising\nattachment was likely to add.\n\nHarriet was to sit again the next day; and Mr. Elton, just as he ought,\nentreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again.\n\n“By all means. We shall be most happy to consider you as one of the\nparty.”\n\nThe same civilities and courtesies, the same success and satisfaction,\ntook place on the morrow, and accompanied the whole progress of the\npicture, which was rapid and happy. Every body who saw it was pleased,\nbut Mr. Elton was in continual raptures, and defended it through every\ncriticism.\n\n“Miss Woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she\nwanted,”--observed Mrs. Weston to him--not in the least suspecting that\nshe was addressing a lover.--“The expression of the eye is most correct,\nbut Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes. It is the fault of\nher face that she has them not.”\n\n“Do you think so?” replied he. “I cannot agree with you. It appears\nto me a most perfect resemblance in every feature. I never saw such a\nlikeness in my life. We must allow for the effect of shade, you know.”\n\n“You have made her too tall, Emma,” said Mr. Knightley.\n\nEmma knew that she had, but would not own it; and Mr. Elton warmly\nadded,\n\n“Oh no! certainly not too tall; not in the least too tall. Consider, she\nis sitting down--which naturally presents a different--which in short\ngives exactly the idea--and the proportions must be preserved, you know.\nProportions, fore-shortening.--Oh no! it gives one exactly the idea of\nsuch a height as Miss Smith's. Exactly so indeed!”\n\n“It is very pretty,” said Mr. Woodhouse. “So prettily done! Just as your\ndrawings always are, my dear. I do not know any body who draws so well\nas you do. The only thing I do not thoroughly like is, that she seems\nto be sitting out of doors, with only a little shawl over her\nshoulders--and it makes one think she must catch cold.”\n\n“But, my dear papa, it is supposed to be summer; a warm day in summer.\nLook at the tree.”\n\n“But it is never safe to sit out of doors, my dear.”\n\n“You, sir, may say any thing,” cried Mr. Elton, “but I must confess that\nI regard it as a most happy thought, the placing of Miss Smith out of\ndoors; and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit! Any other\nsituation would have been much less in character. The naivete of Miss\nSmith's manners--and altogether--Oh, it is most admirable! I cannot keep\nmy eyes from it. I never saw such a likeness.”\n\nThe next thing wanted was to get the picture framed; and here were a few\ndifficulties. It must be done directly; it must be done in London; the\norder must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste\ncould be depended on; and Isabella, the usual doer of all commissions,\nmust not be applied to, because it was December, and Mr. Woodhouse\ncould not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs of\nDecember. But no sooner was the distress known to Mr. Elton, than it\nwas removed. His gallantry was always on the alert. “Might he be trusted\nwith the commission, what infinite pleasure should he have in executing\nit! he could ride to London at any time. It was impossible to say how\nmuch he should be gratified by being employed on such an errand.”\n\n“He was too good!--she could not endure the thought!--she would not give\nhim such a troublesome office for the world,”--brought on the desired\nrepetition of entreaties and assurances,--and a very few minutes settled\nthe business.\n\nMr. Elton was to take the drawing to London, chuse the frame, and give\nthe directions; and Emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure its\nsafety without much incommoding him, while he seemed mostly fearful of\nnot being incommoded enough.\n\n“What a precious deposit!” said he with a tender sigh, as he received\nit.\n\n“This man is almost too gallant to be in love,” thought Emma. “I should\nsay so, but that I suppose there may be a hundred different ways of\nbeing in love. He is an excellent young man, and will suit Harriet\nexactly; it will be an 'Exactly so,' as he says himself; but he does\nsigh and languish, and study for compliments rather more than I could\nendure as a principal. I come in for a pretty good share as a second.\nBut it is his gratitude on Harriet's account.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nThe very day of Mr. Elton's going to London produced a fresh occasion\nfor Emma's services towards her friend. Harriet had been at Hartfield,\nas usual, soon after breakfast; and, after a time, had gone home to\nreturn again to dinner: she returned, and sooner than had been\ntalked of, and with an agitated, hurried look, announcing something\nextraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell. Half a\nminute brought it all out. She had heard, as soon as she got back to\nMrs. Goddard's, that Mr. Martin had been there an hour before, and\nfinding she was not at home, nor particularly expected, had left a\nlittle parcel for her from one of his sisters, and gone away; and on\nopening this parcel, she had actually found, besides the two songs which\nshe had lent Elizabeth to copy, a letter to herself; and this letter was\nfrom him, from Mr. Martin, and contained a direct proposal of marriage.\n“Who could have thought it? She was so surprized she did not know what\nto do. Yes, quite a proposal of marriage; and a very good letter,\nat least she thought so. And he wrote as if he really loved her very\nmuch--but she did not know--and so, she was come as fast as she could to\nask Miss Woodhouse what she should do.--” Emma was half-ashamed of her\nfriend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful.\n\n“Upon my word,” she cried, “the young man is determined not to lose any\nthing for want of asking. He will connect himself well if he can.”\n\n“Will you read the letter?” cried Harriet. “Pray do. I'd rather you\nwould.”\n\nEmma was not sorry to be pressed. She read, and was surprized. The style\nof the letter was much above her expectation. There were not merely no\ngrammatical errors, but as a composition it would not have disgraced a\ngentleman; the language, though plain, was strong and unaffected, and\nthe sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of the writer. It was\nshort, but expressed good sense, warm attachment, liberality, propriety,\neven delicacy of feeling. She paused over it, while Harriet stood\nanxiously watching for her opinion, with a “Well, well,” and was at last\nforced to add, “Is it a good letter? or is it too short?”\n\n“Yes, indeed, a very good letter,” replied Emma rather slowly--“so\ngood a letter, Harriet, that every thing considered, I think one of his\nsisters must have helped him. I can hardly imagine the young man whom\nI saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well, if\nleft quite to his own powers, and yet it is not the style of a woman;\nno, certainly, it is too strong and concise; not diffuse enough for a\nwoman. No doubt he is a sensible man, and I suppose may have a natural\ntalent for--thinks strongly and clearly--and when he takes a pen in\nhand, his thoughts naturally find proper words. It is so with some men.\nYes, I understand the sort of mind. Vigorous, decided, with sentiments\nto a certain point, not coarse. A better written letter, Harriet\n(returning it,) than I had expected.”\n\n“Well,” said the still waiting Harriet;--“well--and--and what shall I\ndo?”\n\n“What shall you do! In what respect? Do you mean with regard to this\nletter?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“But what are you in doubt of? You must answer it of course--and\nspeedily.”\n\n“Yes. But what shall I say? Dear Miss Woodhouse, do advise me.”\n\n“Oh no, no! the letter had much better be all your own. You will express\nyourself very properly, I am sure. There is no danger of your not\nbeing intelligible, which is the first thing. Your meaning must be\nunequivocal; no doubts or demurs: and such expressions of gratitude\nand concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires, will\npresent themselves unbidden to _your_ mind, I am persuaded. You need\nnot be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his\ndisappointment.”\n\n“You think I ought to refuse him then,” said Harriet, looking down.\n\n“Ought to refuse him! My dear Harriet, what do you mean? Are you in any\ndoubt as to that? I thought--but I beg your pardon, perhaps I have been\nunder a mistake. I certainly have been misunderstanding you, if you feel\nin doubt as to the _purport_ of your answer. I had imagined you were\nconsulting me only as to the wording of it.”\n\nHarriet was silent. With a little reserve of manner, Emma continued:\n\n“You mean to return a favourable answer, I collect.”\n\n“No, I do not; that is, I do not mean--What shall I do? What would you\nadvise me to do? Pray, dear Miss Woodhouse, tell me what I ought to do.”\n\n“I shall not give you any advice, Harriet. I will have nothing to do\nwith it. This is a point which you must settle with your feelings.”\n\n“I had no notion that he liked me so very much,” said Harriet,\ncontemplating the letter. For a little while Emma persevered in her\nsilence; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that\nletter might be too powerful, she thought it best to say,\n\n“I lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a woman _doubts_ as\nto whether she should accept a man or not, she certainly ought to refuse\nhim. If she can hesitate as to 'Yes,' she ought to say 'No' directly.\nIt is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful feelings, with\nhalf a heart. I thought it my duty as a friend, and older than yourself,\nto say thus much to you. But do not imagine that I want to influence\nyou.”\n\n“Oh! no, I am sure you are a great deal too kind to--but if you would\njust advise me what I had best do--No, no, I do not mean that--As\nyou say, one's mind ought to be quite made up--One should not be\nhesitating--It is a very serious thing.--It will be safer to say 'No,'\nperhaps.--Do you think I had better say 'No?'”\n\n“Not for the world,” said Emma, smiling graciously, “would I advise you\neither way. You must be the best judge of your own happiness. If you\nprefer Mr. Martin to every other person; if you think him the most\nagreeable man you have ever been in company with, why should you\nhesitate? You blush, Harriet.--Does any body else occur to you at\nthis moment under such a definition? Harriet, Harriet, do not deceive\nyourself; do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion. At this\nmoment whom are you thinking of?”\n\nThe symptoms were favourable.--Instead of answering, Harriet turned away\nconfused, and stood thoughtfully by the fire; and though the letter was\nstill in her hand, it was now mechanically twisted about without regard.\nEmma waited the result with impatience, but not without strong hopes. At\nlast, with some hesitation, Harriet said--\n\n“Miss Woodhouse, as you will not give me your opinion, I must do as well\nas I can by myself; and I have now quite determined, and really almost\nmade up my mind--to refuse Mr. Martin. Do you think I am right?”\n\n“Perfectly, perfectly right, my dearest Harriet; you are doing just\nwhat you ought. While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings to\nmyself, but now that you are so completely decided I have no hesitation\nin approving. Dear Harriet, I give myself joy of this. It would\nhave grieved me to lose your acquaintance, which must have been the\nconsequence of your marrying Mr. Martin. While you were in the smallest\ndegree wavering, I said nothing about it, because I would not influence;\nbut it would have been the loss of a friend to me. I could not have\nvisited Mrs. Robert Martin, of Abbey-Mill Farm. Now I am secure of you\nfor ever.”\n\nHarriet had not surmised her own danger, but the idea of it struck her\nforcibly.\n\n“You could not have visited me!” she cried, looking aghast. “No, to be\nsure you could not; but I never thought of that before. That would have\nbeen too dreadful!--What an escape!--Dear Miss Woodhouse, I would not\ngive up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing\nin the world.”\n\n“Indeed, Harriet, it would have been a severe pang to lose you; but it\nmust have been. You would have thrown yourself out of all good society.\nI must have given you up.”\n\n“Dear me!--How should I ever have borne it! It would have killed me\nnever to come to Hartfield any more!”\n\n“Dear affectionate creature!--_You_ banished to Abbey-Mill Farm!--_You_\nconfined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life! I\nwonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it. He must\nhave a pretty good opinion of himself.”\n\n“I do not think he is conceited either, in general,” said Harriet, her\nconscience opposing such censure; “at least, he is very good natured,\nand I shall always feel much obliged to him, and have a great regard\nfor--but that is quite a different thing from--and you know, though\nhe may like me, it does not follow that I should--and certainly I must\nconfess that since my visiting here I have seen people--and if one comes\nto compare them, person and manners, there is no comparison at all,\n_one_ is so very handsome and agreeable. However, I do really think Mr.\nMartin a very amiable young man, and have a great opinion of him; and\nhis being so much attached to me--and his writing such a letter--but as\nto leaving you, it is what I would not do upon any consideration.”\n\n“Thank you, thank you, my own sweet little friend. We will not be\nparted. A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked, or\nbecause he is attached to her, and can write a tolerable letter.”\n\n“Oh no;--and it is but a short letter too.”\n\nEmma felt the bad taste of her friend, but let it pass with a “very\ntrue; and it would be a small consolation to her, for the clownish\nmanner which might be offending her every hour of the day, to know that\nher husband could write a good letter.”\n\n“Oh! yes, very. Nobody cares for a letter; the thing is, to be always\nhappy with pleasant companions. I am quite determined to refuse him. But\nhow shall I do? What shall I say?”\n\nEmma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer, and advised\nits being written directly, which was agreed to, in the hope of her\nassistance; and though Emma continued to protest against any assistance\nbeing wanted, it was in fact given in the formation of every sentence.\nThe looking over his letter again, in replying to it, had such a\nsoftening tendency, that it was particularly necessary to brace her up\nwith a few decisive expressions; and she was so very much concerned at\nthe idea of making him unhappy, and thought so much of what his mother\nand sisters would think and say, and was so anxious that they should not\nfancy her ungrateful, that Emma believed if the young man had come in\nher way at that moment, he would have been accepted after all.\n\nThis letter, however, was written, and sealed, and sent. The business\nwas finished, and Harriet safe. She was rather low all the evening, but\nEmma could allow for her amiable regrets, and sometimes relieved them by\nspeaking of her own affection, sometimes by bringing forward the idea of\nMr. Elton.\n\n“I shall never be invited to Abbey-Mill again,” was said in rather a\nsorrowful tone.\n\n“Nor, if you were, could I ever bear to part with you, my Harriet. You\nare a great deal too necessary at Hartfield to be spared to Abbey-Mill.”\n\n“And I am sure I should never want to go there; for I am never happy but\nat Hartfield.”\n\nSome time afterwards it was, “I think Mrs. Goddard would be very much\nsurprized if she knew what had happened. I am sure Miss Nash would--for\nMiss Nash thinks her own sister very well married, and it is only a\nlinen-draper.”\n\n“One should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher\nof a school, Harriet. I dare say Miss Nash would envy you such an\nopportunity as this of being married. Even this conquest would appear\nvaluable in her eyes. As to any thing superior for you, I suppose she\nis quite in the dark. The attentions of a certain person can hardly be\namong the tittle-tattle of Highbury yet. Hitherto I fancy you and I\nare the only people to whom his looks and manners have explained\nthemselves.”\n\nHarriet blushed and smiled, and said something about wondering that\npeople should like her so much. The idea of Mr. Elton was certainly\ncheering; but still, after a time, she was tender-hearted again towards\nthe rejected Mr. Martin.\n\n“Now he has got my letter,” said she softly. “I wonder what they are all\ndoing--whether his sisters know--if he is unhappy, they will be unhappy\ntoo. I hope he will not mind it so very much.”\n\n“Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully\nemployed,” cried Emma. “At this moment, perhaps, Mr. Elton is shewing\nyour picture to his mother and sisters, telling how much more beautiful\nis the original, and after being asked for it five or six times,\nallowing them to hear your name, your own dear name.”\n\n“My picture!--But he has left my picture in Bond-street.”\n\n“Has he so!--Then I know nothing of Mr. Elton. No, my dear little modest\nHarriet, depend upon it the picture will not be in Bond-street till\njust before he mounts his horse to-morrow. It is his companion all this\nevening, his solace, his delight. It opens his designs to his family,\nit introduces you among them, it diffuses through the party those\npleasantest feelings of our nature, eager curiosity and warm\nprepossession. How cheerful, how animated, how suspicious, how busy\ntheir imaginations all are!”\n\nHarriet smiled again, and her smiles grew stronger.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nHarriet slept at Hartfield that night. For some weeks past she had been\nspending more than half her time there, and gradually getting to have\na bed-room appropriated to herself; and Emma judged it best in every\nrespect, safest and kindest, to keep her with them as much as possible\njust at present. She was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or\ntwo to Mrs. Goddard's, but it was then to be settled that she should\nreturn to Hartfield, to make a regular visit of some days.\n\nWhile she was gone, Mr. Knightley called, and sat some time with Mr.\nWoodhouse and Emma, till Mr. Woodhouse, who had previously made up his\nmind to walk out, was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it, and was\ninduced by the entreaties of both, though against the scruples of his\nown civility, to leave Mr. Knightley for that purpose. Mr. Knightley,\nwho had nothing of ceremony about him, was offering by his short,\ndecided answers, an amusing contrast to the protracted apologies and\ncivil hesitations of the other.\n\n“Well, I believe, if you will excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if you will not\nconsider me as doing a very rude thing, I shall take Emma's advice and\ngo out for a quarter of an hour. As the sun is out, I believe I had\nbetter take my three turns while I can. I treat you without ceremony,\nMr. Knightley. We invalids think we are privileged people.”\n\n“My dear sir, do not make a stranger of me.”\n\n“I leave an excellent substitute in my daughter. Emma will be happy to\nentertain you. And therefore I think I will beg your excuse and take my\nthree turns--my winter walk.”\n\n“You cannot do better, sir.”\n\n“I would ask for the pleasure of your company, Mr. Knightley, but I am a\nvery slow walker, and my pace would be tedious to you; and, besides, you\nhave another long walk before you, to Donwell Abbey.”\n\n“Thank you, sir, thank you; I am going this moment myself; and I think\nthe sooner _you_ go the better. I will fetch your greatcoat and open the\ngarden door for you.”\n\nMr. Woodhouse at last was off; but Mr. Knightley, instead of being\nimmediately off likewise, sat down again, seemingly inclined for more\nchat. He began speaking of Harriet, and speaking of her with more\nvoluntary praise than Emma had ever heard before.\n\n“I cannot rate her beauty as you do,” said he; “but she is a\npretty little creature, and I am inclined to think very well of her\ndisposition. Her character depends upon those she is with; but in good\nhands she will turn out a valuable woman.”\n\n“I am glad you think so; and the good hands, I hope, may not be\nwanting.”\n\n“Come,” said he, “you are anxious for a compliment, so I will tell you\nthat you have improved her. You have cured her of her school-girl's\ngiggle; she really does you credit.”\n\n“Thank you. I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe I had been\nof some use; but it is not every body who will bestow praise where they\nmay. _You_ do not often overpower me with it.”\n\n“You are expecting her again, you say, this morning?”\n\n“Almost every moment. She has been gone longer already than she\nintended.”\n\n“Something has happened to delay her; some visitors perhaps.”\n\n“Highbury gossips!--Tiresome wretches!”\n\n“Harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would.”\n\nEmma knew this was too true for contradiction, and therefore said\nnothing. He presently added, with a smile,\n\n“I do not pretend to fix on times or places, but I must tell you that\nI have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of\nsomething to her advantage.”\n\n“Indeed! how so? of what sort?”\n\n“A very serious sort, I assure you;” still smiling.\n\n“Very serious! I can think of but one thing--Who is in love with her?\nWho makes you their confidant?”\n\nEmma was more than half in hopes of Mr. Elton's having dropt a hint.\nMr. Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser, and she knew Mr.\nElton looked up to him.\n\n“I have reason to think,” he replied, “that Harriet Smith will soon have\nan offer of marriage, and from a most unexceptionable quarter:--Robert\nMartin is the man. Her visit to Abbey-Mill, this summer, seems to have\ndone his business. He is desperately in love and means to marry her.”\n\n“He is very obliging,” said Emma; “but is he sure that Harriet means to\nmarry him?”\n\n“Well, well, means to make her an offer then. Will that do? He came to\nthe Abbey two evenings ago, on purpose to consult me about it. He knows\nI have a thorough regard for him and all his family, and, I believe,\nconsiders me as one of his best friends. He came to ask me whether\nI thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early; whether\nI thought her too young: in short, whether I approved his choice\naltogether; having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered\n(especially since _your_ making so much of her) as in a line of society\nabove him. I was very much pleased with all that he said. I never hear\nbetter sense from any one than Robert Martin. He always speaks to the\npurpose; open, straightforward, and very well judging. He told me every\nthing; his circumstances and plans, and what they all proposed doing in\nthe event of his marriage. He is an excellent young man, both as son and\nbrother. I had no hesitation in advising him to marry. He proved to me\nthat he could afford it; and that being the case, I was convinced he\ncould not do better. I praised the fair lady too, and altogether sent\nhim away very happy. If he had never esteemed my opinion before, he\nwould have thought highly of me then; and, I dare say, left the house\nthinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had. This happened\nthe night before last. Now, as we may fairly suppose, he would not allow\nmuch time to pass before he spoke to the lady, and as he does not appear\nto have spoken yesterday, it is not unlikely that he should be at Mrs.\nGoddard's to-day; and she may be detained by a visitor, without thinking\nhim at all a tiresome wretch.”\n\n“Pray, Mr. Knightley,” said Emma, who had been smiling to herself\nthrough a great part of this speech, “how do you know that Mr. Martin\ndid not speak yesterday?”\n\n“Certainly,” replied he, surprized, “I do not absolutely know it; but it\nmay be inferred. Was not she the whole day with you?”\n\n“Come,” said she, “I will tell you something, in return for what\nyou have told me. He did speak yesterday--that is, he wrote, and was\nrefused.”\n\nThis was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed; and Mr.\nKnightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure, as he stood\nup, in tall indignation, and said,\n\n“Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her. What is the\nfoolish girl about?”\n\n“Oh! to be sure,” cried Emma, “it is always incomprehensible to a man\nthat a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage. A man always\nimagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her.”\n\n“Nonsense! a man does not imagine any such thing. But what is the\nmeaning of this? Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin? madness, if it is\nso; but I hope you are mistaken.”\n\n“I saw her answer!--nothing could be clearer.”\n\n“You saw her answer!--you wrote her answer too. Emma, this is your\ndoing. You persuaded her to refuse him.”\n\n“And if I did, (which, however, I am far from allowing) I should not\nfeel that I had done wrong. Mr. Martin is a very respectable young man,\nbut I cannot admit him to be Harriet's equal; and am rather surprized\nindeed that he should have ventured to address her. By your account, he\ndoes seem to have had some scruples. It is a pity that they were ever\ngot over.”\n\n“Not Harriet's equal!” exclaimed Mr. Knightley loudly and warmly; and\nwith calmer asperity, added, a few moments afterwards, “No, he is\nnot her equal indeed, for he is as much her superior in sense as in\nsituation. Emma, your infatuation about that girl blinds you. What are\nHarriet Smith's claims, either of birth, nature or education, to any\nconnexion higher than Robert Martin? She is the natural daughter of\nnobody knows whom, with probably no settled provision at all, and\ncertainly no respectable relations. She is known only as parlour-boarder\nat a common school. She is not a sensible girl, nor a girl of any\ninformation. She has been taught nothing useful, and is too young and\ntoo simple to have acquired any thing herself. At her age she can have\nno experience, and with her little wit, is not very likely ever to have\nany that can avail her. She is pretty, and she is good tempered, and\nthat is all. My only scruple in advising the match was on his account,\nas being beneath his deserts, and a bad connexion for him. I felt that,\nas to fortune, in all probability he might do much better; and that as\nto a rational companion or useful helpmate, he could not do worse. But I\ncould not reason so to a man in love, and was willing to trust to there\nbeing no harm in her, to her having that sort of disposition, which, in\ngood hands, like his, might be easily led aright and turn out very well.\nThe advantage of the match I felt to be all on her side; and had not the\nsmallest doubt (nor have I now) that there would be a general cry-out\nupon her extreme good luck. Even _your_ satisfaction I made sure of.\nIt crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend's\nleaving Highbury, for the sake of her being settled so well. I remember\nsaying to myself, 'Even Emma, with all her partiality for Harriet, will\nthink this a good match.'”\n\n“I cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of Emma as to say any\nsuch thing. What! think a farmer, (and with all his sense and all his\nmerit Mr. Martin is nothing more,) a good match for my intimate friend!\nNot regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom\nI could never admit as an acquaintance of my own! I wonder you should\nthink it possible for me to have such feelings. I assure you mine are\nvery different. I must think your statement by no means fair. You are\nnot just to Harriet's claims. They would be estimated very differently\nby others as well as myself; Mr. Martin may be the richest of the two,\nbut he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in society.--The sphere in\nwhich she moves is much above his.--It would be a degradation.”\n\n“A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance, to be married to a\nrespectable, intelligent gentleman-farmer!”\n\n“As to the circumstances of her birth, though in a legal sense she may\nbe called Nobody, it will not hold in common sense. She is not to pay\nfor the offence of others, by being held below the level of those with\nwhom she is brought up.--There can scarcely be a doubt that her father\nis a gentleman--and a gentleman of fortune.--Her allowance is\nvery liberal; nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or\ncomfort.--That she is a gentleman's daughter, is indubitable to me; that\nshe associates with gentlemen's daughters, no one, I apprehend, will\ndeny.--She is superior to Mr. Robert Martin.”\n\n“Whoever might be her parents,” said Mr. Knightley, “whoever may have\nhad the charge of her, it does not appear to have been any part of\ntheir plan to introduce her into what you would call good society. After\nreceiving a very indifferent education she is left in Mrs. Goddard's\nhands to shift as she can;--to move, in short, in Mrs. Goddard's line,\nto have Mrs. Goddard's acquaintance. Her friends evidently thought\nthis good enough for her; and it _was_ good enough. She desired nothing\nbetter herself. Till you chose to turn her into a friend, her mind had\nno distaste for her own set, nor any ambition beyond it. She was as\nhappy as possible with the Martins in the summer. She had no sense of\nsuperiority then. If she has it now, you have given it. You have been no\nfriend to Harriet Smith, Emma. Robert Martin would never have proceeded\nso far, if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to\nhim. I know him well. He has too much real feeling to address any\nwoman on the haphazard of selfish passion. And as to conceit, he is\nthe farthest from it of any man I know. Depend upon it he had\nencouragement.”\n\nIt was most convenient to Emma not to make a direct reply to this\nassertion; she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject\nagain.\n\n“You are a very warm friend to Mr. Martin; but, as I said before,\nare unjust to Harriet. Harriet's claims to marry well are not so\ncontemptible as you represent them. She is not a clever girl, but she\nhas better sense than you are aware of, and does not deserve to have her\nunderstanding spoken of so slightingly. Waiving that point, however, and\nsupposing her to be, as you describe her, only pretty and good-natured,\nlet me tell you, that in the degree she possesses them, they are not\ntrivial recommendations to the world in general, for she is, in fact, a\nbeautiful girl, and must be thought so by ninety-nine people out of an\nhundred; and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the\nsubject of beauty than they are generally supposed; till they do fall\nin love with well-informed minds instead of handsome faces, a girl, with\nsuch loveliness as Harriet, has a certainty of being admired and sought\nafter, of having the power of chusing from among many, consequently a\nclaim to be nice. Her good-nature, too, is not so very slight a claim,\ncomprehending, as it does, real, thorough sweetness of temper and\nmanner, a very humble opinion of herself, and a great readiness to\nbe pleased with other people. I am very much mistaken if your sex in\ngeneral would not think such beauty, and such temper, the highest claims\na woman could possess.”\n\n“Upon my word, Emma, to hear you abusing the reason you have, is almost\nenough to make me think so too. Better be without sense, than misapply\nit as you do.”\n\n“To be sure!” cried she playfully. “I know _that_ is the feeling of\nyou all. I know that such a girl as Harriet is exactly what every\nman delights in--what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his\njudgment. Oh! Harriet may pick and chuse. Were you, yourself, ever to\nmarry, she is the very woman for you. And is she, at seventeen, just\nentering into life, just beginning to be known, to be wondered at\nbecause she does not accept the first offer she receives? No--pray let\nher have time to look about her.”\n\n“I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy,” said Mr. Knightley\npresently, “though I have kept my thoughts to myself; but I now perceive\nthat it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet. You will puff her up\nwith such ideas of her own beauty, and of what she has a claim to, that,\nin a little while, nobody within her reach will be good enough for her.\nVanity working on a weak head, produces every sort of mischief. Nothing\nso easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations too high. Miss\nHarriet Smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast, though\nshe is a very pretty girl. Men of sense, whatever you may chuse to\nsay, do not want silly wives. Men of family would not be very fond of\nconnecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity--and most prudent\nmen would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be\ninvolved in, when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed. Let\nher marry Robert Martin, and she is safe, respectable, and happy for\never; but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly, and teach her\nto be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large\nfortune, she may be a parlour-boarder at Mrs. Goddard's all the rest\nof her life--or, at least, (for Harriet Smith is a girl who will marry\nsomebody or other,) till she grow desperate, and is glad to catch at the\nold writing-master's son.”\n\n“We think so very differently on this point, Mr. Knightley, that there\ncan be no use in canvassing it. We shall only be making each other more\nangry. But as to my _letting_ her marry Robert Martin, it is impossible;\nshe has refused him, and so decidedly, I think, as must prevent any\nsecond application. She must abide by the evil of having refused him,\nwhatever it may be; and as to the refusal itself, I will not pretend to\nsay that I might not influence her a little; but I assure you there\nwas very little for me or for any body to do. His appearance is so much\nagainst him, and his manner so bad, that if she ever were disposed to\nfavour him, she is not now. I can imagine, that before she had seen\nany body superior, she might tolerate him. He was the brother of her\nfriends, and he took pains to please her; and altogether, having seen\nnobody better (that must have been his great assistant) she might not,\nwhile she was at Abbey-Mill, find him disagreeable. But the case\nis altered now. She knows now what gentlemen are; and nothing but a\ngentleman in education and manner has any chance with Harriet.”\n\n“Nonsense, errant nonsense, as ever was talked!” cried Mr.\nKnightley.--“Robert Martin's manners have sense, sincerity, and\ngood-humour to recommend them; and his mind has more true gentility than\nHarriet Smith could understand.”\n\nEmma made no answer, and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned, but was\nreally feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone. She\ndid not repent what she had done; she still thought herself a better\njudge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be;\nbut yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general,\nwhich made her dislike having it so loudly against her; and to have him\nsitting just opposite to her in angry state, was very disagreeable.\nSome minutes passed in this unpleasant silence, with only one attempt\non Emma's side to talk of the weather, but he made no answer. He was\nthinking. The result of his thoughts appeared at last in these words.\n\n“Robert Martin has no great loss--if he can but think so; and I hope it\nwill not be long before he does. Your views for Harriet are best known\nto yourself; but as you make no secret of your love of match-making, it\nis fair to suppose that views, and plans, and projects you have;--and as\na friend I shall just hint to you that if Elton is the man, I think it\nwill be all labour in vain.”\n\nEmma laughed and disclaimed. He continued,\n\n“Depend upon it, Elton will not do. Elton is a very good sort of man,\nand a very respectable vicar of Highbury, but not at all likely to make\nan imprudent match. He knows the value of a good income as well as any\nbody. Elton may talk sentimentally, but he will act rationally. He is\nas well acquainted with his own claims, as you can be with Harriet's.\nHe knows that he is a very handsome young man, and a great favourite\nwherever he goes; and from his general way of talking in unreserved\nmoments, when there are only men present, I am convinced that he does\nnot mean to throw himself away. I have heard him speak with great\nanimation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters are\nintimate with, who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece.”\n\n“I am very much obliged to you,” said Emma, laughing again. “If I had\nset my heart on Mr. Elton's marrying Harriet, it would have been very\nkind to open my eyes; but at present I only want to keep Harriet to\nmyself. I have done with match-making indeed. I could never hope to\nequal my own doings at Randalls. I shall leave off while I am well.”\n\n“Good morning to you,”--said he, rising and walking off abruptly. He was\nvery much vexed. He felt the disappointment of the young man, and was\nmortified to have been the means of promoting it, by the sanction he had\ngiven; and the part which he was persuaded Emma had taken in the affair,\nwas provoking him exceedingly.\n\nEmma remained in a state of vexation too; but there was more\nindistinctness in the causes of her's, than in his. She did not always\nfeel so absolutely satisfied with herself, so entirely convinced that\nher opinions were right and her adversary's wrong, as Mr. Knightley. He\nwalked off in more complete self-approbation than he left for her. She\nwas not so materially cast down, however, but that a little time and\nthe return of Harriet were very adequate restoratives. Harriet's staying\naway so long was beginning to make her uneasy. The possibility of the\nyoung man's coming to Mrs. Goddard's that morning, and meeting with\nHarriet and pleading his own cause, gave alarming ideas. The dread\nof such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness; and when\nHarriet appeared, and in very good spirits, and without having any\nsuch reason to give for her long absence, she felt a satisfaction which\nsettled her with her own mind, and convinced her, that let Mr.\nKnightley think or say what he would, she had done nothing which woman's\nfriendship and woman's feelings would not justify.\n\nHe had frightened her a little about Mr. Elton; but when she considered\nthat Mr. Knightley could not have observed him as she had done, neither\nwith the interest, nor (she must be allowed to tell herself, in spite of\nMr. Knightley's pretensions) with the skill of such an observer on such\na question as herself, that he had spoken it hastily and in anger, she\nwas able to believe, that he had rather said what he wished resentfully\nto be true, than what he knew any thing about. He certainly might have\nheard Mr. Elton speak with more unreserve than she had ever done, and\nMr. Elton might not be of an imprudent, inconsiderate disposition as to\nmoney matters; he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise\nto them; but then, Mr. Knightley did not make due allowance for the\ninfluence of a strong passion at war with all interested motives. Mr.\nKnightley saw no such passion, and of course thought nothing of its\neffects; but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming\nany hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest; and\nmore than a reasonable, becoming degree of prudence, she was very sure\ndid not belong to Mr. Elton.\n\nHarriet's cheerful look and manner established hers: she came back, not\nto think of Mr. Martin, but to talk of Mr. Elton. Miss Nash had been\ntelling her something, which she repeated immediately with great\ndelight. Mr. Perry had been to Mrs. Goddard's to attend a sick child,\nand Miss Nash had seen him, and he had told Miss Nash, that as he was\ncoming back yesterday from Clayton Park, he had met Mr. Elton, and\nfound to his great surprize, that Mr. Elton was actually on his road\nto London, and not meaning to return till the morrow, though it was the\nwhist-club night, which he had been never known to miss before; and Mr.\nPerry had remonstrated with him about it, and told him how shabby it\nwas in him, their best player, to absent himself, and tried very much to\npersuade him to put off his journey only one day; but it would not\ndo; Mr. Elton had been determined to go on, and had said in a _very_\n_particular_ way indeed, that he was going on business which he would\nnot put off for any inducement in the world; and something about a\nvery enviable commission, and being the bearer of something exceedingly\nprecious. Mr. Perry could not quite understand him, but he was very sure\nthere must be a _lady_ in the case, and he told him so; and Mr. Elton\nonly looked very conscious and smiling, and rode off in great spirits.\nMiss Nash had told her all this, and had talked a great deal more about\nMr. Elton; and said, looking so very significantly at her, “that she did\nnot pretend to understand what his business might be, but she only\nknew that any woman whom Mr. Elton could prefer, she should think the\nluckiest woman in the world; for, beyond a doubt, Mr. Elton had not his\nequal for beauty or agreeableness.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nMr. Knightley might quarrel with her, but Emma could not quarrel with\nherself. He was so much displeased, that it was longer than usual before\nhe came to Hartfield again; and when they did meet, his grave looks\nshewed that she was not forgiven. She was sorry, but could not repent.\nOn the contrary, her plans and proceedings were more and more justified\nand endeared to her by the general appearances of the next few days.\n\nThe Picture, elegantly framed, came safely to hand soon after Mr.\nElton's return, and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common\nsitting-room, he got up to look at it, and sighed out his half sentences\nof admiration just as he ought; and as for Harriet's feelings, they were\nvisibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment as\nher youth and sort of mind admitted. Emma was soon perfectly satisfied\nof Mr. Martin's being no otherwise remembered, than as he furnished a\ncontrast with Mr. Elton, of the utmost advantage to the latter.\n\nHer views of improving her little friend's mind, by a great deal of\nuseful reading and conversation, had never yet led to more than a few\nfirst chapters, and the intention of going on to-morrow. It was much\neasier to chat than to study; much pleasanter to let her imagination\nrange and work at Harriet's fortune, than to be labouring to enlarge\nher comprehension or exercise it on sober facts; and the only literary\npursuit which engaged Harriet at present, the only mental provision she\nwas making for the evening of life, was the collecting and transcribing\nall the riddles of every sort that she could meet with, into a thin\nquarto of hot-pressed paper, made up by her friend, and ornamented with\nciphers and trophies.\n\nIn this age of literature, such collections on a very grand scale are\nnot uncommon. Miss Nash, head-teacher at Mrs. Goddard's, had written out\nat least three hundred; and Harriet, who had taken the first hint of it\nfrom her, hoped, with Miss Woodhouse's help, to get a great many more.\nEmma assisted with her invention, memory and taste; and as Harriet wrote\na very pretty hand, it was likely to be an arrangement of the first\norder, in form as well as quantity.\n\nMr. Woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the\ngirls, and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting\nin. “So many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young--he\nwondered he could not remember them! but he hoped he should in time.”\n And it always ended in “Kitty, a fair but frozen maid.”\n\nHis good friend Perry, too, whom he had spoken to on the subject,\ndid not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind; but he\nhad desired Perry to be upon the watch, and as he went about so much,\nsomething, he thought, might come from that quarter.\n\nIt was by no means his daughter's wish that the intellects of Highbury\nin general should be put under requisition. Mr. Elton was the only one\nwhose assistance she asked. He was invited to contribute any really good\nenigmas, charades, or conundrums that he might recollect; and she had\nthe pleasure of seeing him most intently at work with his recollections;\nand at the same time, as she could perceive, most earnestly careful that\nnothing ungallant, nothing that did not breathe a compliment to the\nsex should pass his lips. They owed to him their two or three politest\npuzzles; and the joy and exultation with which at last he recalled, and\nrather sentimentally recited, that well-known charade,\n\n    My first doth affliction denote,\n      Which my second is destin'd to feel\n    And my whole is the best antidote\n      That affliction to soften and heal.--\n\nmade her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it some\npages ago already.\n\n“Why will not you write one yourself for us, Mr. Elton?” said she; “that\nis the only security for its freshness; and nothing could be easier to\nyou.”\n\n“Oh no! he had never written, hardly ever, any thing of the kind in his\nlife. The stupidest fellow! He was afraid not even Miss Woodhouse”--he\nstopt a moment--“or Miss Smith could inspire him.”\n\nThe very next day however produced some proof of inspiration. He\ncalled for a few moments, just to leave a piece of paper on the table\ncontaining, as he said, a charade, which a friend of his had addressed\nto a young lady, the object of his admiration, but which, from his\nmanner, Emma was immediately convinced must be his own.\n\n“I do not offer it for Miss Smith's collection,” said he. “Being my\nfriend's, I have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye,\nbut perhaps you may not dislike looking at it.”\n\nThe speech was more to Emma than to Harriet, which Emma could\nunderstand. There was deep consciousness about him, and he found\nit easier to meet her eye than her friend's. He was gone the next\nmoment:--after another moment's pause,\n\n“Take it,” said Emma, smiling, and pushing the paper towards\nHarriet--“it is for you. Take your own.”\n\nBut Harriet was in a tremor, and could not touch it; and Emma, never\nloth to be first, was obliged to examine it herself.\n\n        To Miss--\n\n          CHARADE.\n\n    My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings,\n      Lords of the earth! their luxury and ease.\n    Another view of man, my second brings,\n      Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!\n\n    But ah! united, what reverse we have!\n      Man's boasted power and freedom, all are flown;\n    Lord of the earth and sea, he bends a slave,\n      And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.\n\n      Thy ready wit the word will soon supply,\n      May its approval beam in that soft eye!\n\nShe cast her eye over it, pondered, caught the meaning, read it through\nagain to be quite certain, and quite mistress of the lines, and then\npassing it to Harriet, sat happily smiling, and saying to herself, while\nHarriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion of hope and\ndulness, “Very well, Mr. Elton, very well indeed. I have read worse\ncharades. _Courtship_--a very good hint. I give you credit for it. This\nis feeling your way. This is saying very plainly--'Pray, Miss Smith,\ngive me leave to pay my addresses to you. Approve my charade and my\nintentions in the same glance.'\n\n      May its approval beam in that soft eye!\n\nHarriet exactly. Soft is the very word for her eye--of all epithets, the\njustest that could be given.\n\n      Thy ready wit the word will soon supply.\n\nHumph--Harriet's ready wit! All the better. A man must be very much in\nlove, indeed, to describe her so. Ah! Mr. Knightley, I wish you had the\nbenefit of this; I think this would convince you. For once in your life\nyou would be obliged to own yourself mistaken. An excellent charade\nindeed! and very much to the purpose. Things must come to a crisis soon\nnow.”\n\nShe was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations,\nwhich were otherwise of a sort to run into great length, by the\neagerness of Harriet's wondering questions.\n\n“What can it be, Miss Woodhouse?--what can it be? I have not an idea--I\ncannot guess it in the least. What can it possibly be? Do try to find\nit out, Miss Woodhouse. Do help me. I never saw any thing so hard. Is it\nkingdom? I wonder who the friend was--and who could be the young lady.\nDo you think it is a good one? Can it be woman?\n\n      And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.\n\nCan it be Neptune?\n\n      Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!\n\nOr a trident? or a mermaid? or a shark? Oh, no! shark is only one\nsyllable. It must be very clever, or he would not have brought it. Oh!\nMiss Woodhouse, do you think we shall ever find it out?”\n\n“Mermaids and sharks! Nonsense! My dear Harriet, what are you thinking\nof? Where would be the use of his bringing us a charade made by a friend\nupon a mermaid or a shark? Give me the paper and listen.\n\nFor Miss ------, read Miss Smith.\n\n    My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings,\n      Lords of the earth! their luxury and ease.\n\nThat is _court_.\n\n    Another view of man, my second brings;\n      Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!\n\nThat is _ship_;--plain as it can be.--Now for the cream.\n\n    But ah! united, (_courtship_, you know,) what reverse we have!\n      Man's boasted power and freedom, all are flown.\n    Lord of the earth and sea, he bends a slave,\n      And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.\n\nA very proper compliment!--and then follows the application, which\nI think, my dear Harriet, you cannot find much difficulty in\ncomprehending. Read it in comfort to yourself. There can be no doubt of\nits being written for you and to you.”\n\nHarriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion. She read\nthe concluding lines, and was all flutter and happiness. She could not\nspeak. But she was not wanted to speak. It was enough for her to feel.\nEmma spoke for her.\n\n“There is so pointed, and so particular a meaning in this compliment,”\n said she, “that I cannot have a doubt as to Mr. Elton's intentions. You\nare his object--and you will soon receive the completest proof of it. I\nthought it must be so. I thought I could not be so deceived; but now, it\nis clear; the state of his mind is as clear and decided, as my wishes on\nthe subject have been ever since I knew you. Yes, Harriet, just so long\nhave I been wanting the very circumstance to happen that has happened.\nI could never tell whether an attachment between you and Mr. Elton were\nmost desirable or most natural. Its probability and its eligibility have\nreally so equalled each other! I am very happy. I congratulate you, my\ndear Harriet, with all my heart. This is an attachment which a woman may\nwell feel pride in creating. This is a connexion which offers nothing\nbut good. It will give you every thing that you want--consideration,\nindependence, a proper home--it will fix you in the centre of all your\nreal friends, close to Hartfield and to me, and confirm our intimacy\nfor ever. This, Harriet, is an alliance which can never raise a blush in\neither of us.”\n\n“Dear Miss Woodhouse!”--and “Dear Miss Woodhouse,” was all that Harriet,\nwith many tender embraces could articulate at first; but when they did\narrive at something more like conversation, it was sufficiently clear to\nher friend that she saw, felt, anticipated, and remembered just as she\nought. Mr. Elton's superiority had very ample acknowledgment.\n\n“Whatever you say is always right,” cried Harriet, “and therefore I\nsuppose, and believe, and hope it must be so; but otherwise I could not\nhave imagined it. It is so much beyond any thing I deserve. Mr. Elton,\nwho might marry any body! There cannot be two opinions about _him_. He\nis so very superior. Only think of those sweet verses--'To Miss ------.'\nDear me, how clever!--Could it really be meant for me?”\n\n“I cannot make a question, or listen to a question about that. It is a\ncertainty. Receive it on my judgment. It is a sort of prologue to\nthe play, a motto to the chapter; and will be soon followed by\nmatter-of-fact prose.”\n\n“It is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected. I am sure,\na month ago, I had no more idea myself!--The strangest things do take\nplace!”\n\n“When Miss Smiths and Mr. Eltons get acquainted--they do indeed--and\nreally it is strange; it is out of the common course that what is so\nevidently, so palpably desirable--what courts the pre-arrangement of\nother people, should so immediately shape itself into the proper form.\nYou and Mr. Elton are by situation called together; you belong to one\nanother by every circumstance of your respective homes. Your marrying\nwill be equal to the match at Randalls. There does seem to be a\nsomething in the air of Hartfield which gives love exactly the right\ndirection, and sends it into the very channel where it ought to flow.\n\n      The course of true love never did run smooth--\n\nA Hartfield edition of Shakespeare would have a long note on that\npassage.”\n\n“That Mr. Elton should really be in love with me,--me, of all people,\nwho did not know him, to speak to him, at Michaelmas! And he, the very\nhandsomest man that ever was, and a man that every body looks up to,\nquite like Mr. Knightley! His company so sought after, that every body\nsays he need not eat a single meal by himself if he does not chuse it;\nthat he has more invitations than there are days in the week. And so\nexcellent in the Church! Miss Nash has put down all the texts he has\never preached from since he came to Highbury. Dear me! When I look back\nto the first time I saw him! How little did I think!--The two Abbots and\nI ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he\nwas going by, and Miss Nash came and scolded us away, and staid to look\nthrough herself; however, she called me back presently, and let me\nlook too, which was very good-natured. And how beautiful we thought he\nlooked! He was arm-in-arm with Mr. Cole.”\n\n“This is an alliance which, whoever--whatever your friends may be, must\nbe agreeable to them, provided at least they have common sense; and we\nare not to be addressing our conduct to fools. If they are anxious to\nsee you _happily_ married, here is a man whose amiable character gives\nevery assurance of it;--if they wish to have you settled in the same\ncountry and circle which they have chosen to place you in, here it will\nbe accomplished; and if their only object is that you should, in the\ncommon phrase, be _well_ married, here is the comfortable fortune, the\nrespectable establishment, the rise in the world which must satisfy\nthem.”\n\n“Yes, very true. How nicely you talk; I love to hear you. You understand\nevery thing. You and Mr. Elton are one as clever as the other. This\ncharade!--If I had studied a twelvemonth, I could never have made any\nthing like it.”\n\n“I thought he meant to try his skill, by his manner of declining it\nyesterday.”\n\n“I do think it is, without exception, the best charade I ever read.”\n\n“I never read one more to the purpose, certainly.”\n\n“It is as long again as almost all we have had before.”\n\n“I do not consider its length as particularly in its favour. Such things\nin general cannot be too short.”\n\nHarriet was too intent on the lines to hear. The most satisfactory\ncomparisons were rising in her mind.\n\n“It is one thing,” said she, presently--her cheeks in a glow--“to have\nvery good sense in a common way, like every body else, and if there is\nany thing to say, to sit down and write a letter, and say just what you\nmust, in a short way; and another, to write verses and charades like\nthis.”\n\nEmma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of Mr. Martin's\nprose.\n\n“Such sweet lines!” continued Harriet--“these two last!--But how shall I\never be able to return the paper, or say I have found it out?--Oh! Miss\nWoodhouse, what can we do about that?”\n\n“Leave it to me. You do nothing. He will be here this evening, I dare\nsay, and then I will give it him back, and some nonsense or other will\npass between us, and you shall not be committed.--Your soft eyes shall\nchuse their own time for beaming. Trust to me.”\n\n“Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what a pity that I must not write this beautiful\ncharade into my book! I am sure I have not got one half so good.”\n\n“Leave out the two last lines, and there is no reason why you should not\nwrite it into your book.”\n\n“Oh! but those two lines are”--\n\n--“The best of all. Granted;--for private enjoyment; and for private\nenjoyment keep them. They are not at all the less written you know,\nbecause you divide them. The couplet does not cease to be, nor does its\nmeaning change. But take it away, and all _appropriation_ ceases, and a\nvery pretty gallant charade remains, fit for any collection. Depend upon\nit, he would not like to have his charade slighted, much better than his\npassion. A poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities, or\nneither. Give me the book, I will write it down, and then there can be\nno possible reflection on you.”\n\nHarriet submitted, though her mind could hardly separate the parts,\nso as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down a\ndeclaration of love. It seemed too precious an offering for any degree\nof publicity.\n\n“I shall never let that book go out of my own hands,” said she.\n\n“Very well,” replied Emma; “a most natural feeling; and the longer it\nlasts, the better I shall be pleased. But here is my father coming: you\nwill not object to my reading the charade to him. It will be giving him\nso much pleasure! He loves any thing of the sort, and especially any\nthing that pays woman a compliment. He has the tenderest spirit of\ngallantry towards us all!--You must let me read it to him.”\n\nHarriet looked grave.\n\n“My dear Harriet, you must not refine too much upon this charade.--You\nwill betray your feelings improperly, if you are too conscious and too\nquick, and appear to affix more meaning, or even quite all the meaning\nwhich may be affixed to it. Do not be overpowered by such a little\ntribute of admiration. If he had been anxious for secrecy, he would not\nhave left the paper while I was by; but he rather pushed it towards me\nthan towards you. Do not let us be too solemn on the business. He has\nencouragement enough to proceed, without our sighing out our souls over\nthis charade.”\n\n“Oh! no--I hope I shall not be ridiculous about it. Do as you please.”\n\nMr. Woodhouse came in, and very soon led to the subject again, by the\nrecurrence of his very frequent inquiry of “Well, my dears, how does\nyour book go on?--Have you got any thing fresh?”\n\n“Yes, papa; we have something to read you, something quite fresh. A\npiece of paper was found on the table this morning--(dropt, we suppose,\nby a fairy)--containing a very pretty charade, and we have just copied\nit in.”\n\nShe read it to him, just as he liked to have any thing read, slowly and\ndistinctly, and two or three times over, with explanations of every\npart as she proceeded--and he was very much pleased, and, as she had\nforeseen, especially struck with the complimentary conclusion.\n\n“Aye, that's very just, indeed, that's very properly said. Very true.\n'Woman, lovely woman.' It is such a pretty charade, my dear, that I\ncan easily guess what fairy brought it.--Nobody could have written so\nprettily, but you, Emma.”\n\nEmma only nodded, and smiled.--After a little thinking, and a very\ntender sigh, he added,\n\n“Ah! it is no difficulty to see who you take after! Your dear mother\nwas so clever at all those things! If I had but her memory! But I can\nremember nothing;--not even that particular riddle which you have\nheard me mention; I can only recollect the first stanza; and there are\nseveral.\n\n    Kitty, a fair but frozen maid,\n      Kindled a flame I yet deplore,\n    The hood-wink'd boy I called to aid,\n    Though of his near approach afraid,\n      So fatal to my suit before.\n\nAnd that is all that I can recollect of it--but it is very clever all\nthe way through. But I think, my dear, you said you had got it.”\n\n“Yes, papa, it is written out in our second page. We copied it from the\nElegant Extracts. It was Garrick's, you know.”\n\n“Aye, very true.--I wish I could recollect more of it.\n\n    Kitty, a fair but frozen maid.\n\nThe name makes me think of poor Isabella; for she was very near being\nchristened Catherine after her grandmama. I hope we shall have her here\nnext week. Have you thought, my dear, where you shall put her--and what\nroom there will be for the children?”\n\n“Oh! yes--she will have her own room, of course; the room she always\nhas;--and there is the nursery for the children,--just as usual, you\nknow. Why should there be any change?”\n\n“I do not know, my dear--but it is so long since she was here!--not\nsince last Easter, and then only for a few days.--Mr. John Knightley's\nbeing a lawyer is very inconvenient.--Poor Isabella!--she is sadly taken\naway from us all!--and how sorry she will be when she comes, not to see\nMiss Taylor here!”\n\n“She will not be surprized, papa, at least.”\n\n“I do not know, my dear. I am sure I was very much surprized when I\nfirst heard she was going to be married.”\n\n“We must ask Mr. and Mrs. Weston to dine with us, while Isabella is\nhere.”\n\n“Yes, my dear, if there is time.--But--(in a very depressed tone)--she\nis coming for only one week. There will not be time for any thing.”\n\n“It is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer--but it seems a case of\nnecessity. Mr. John Knightley must be in town again on the 28th, and we\nought to be thankful, papa, that we are to have the whole of the time\nthey can give to the country, that two or three days are not to be taken\nout for the Abbey. Mr. Knightley promises to give up his claim this\nChristmas--though you know it is longer since they were with him, than\nwith us.”\n\n“It would be very hard, indeed, my dear, if poor Isabella were to be\nanywhere but at Hartfield.”\n\nMr. Woodhouse could never allow for Mr. Knightley's claims on his\nbrother, or any body's claims on Isabella, except his own. He sat musing\na little while, and then said,\n\n“But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back so\nsoon, though he does. I think, Emma, I shall try and persuade her to\nstay longer with us. She and the children might stay very well.”\n\n“Ah! papa--that is what you never have been able to accomplish, and I\ndo not think you ever will. Isabella cannot bear to stay behind her\nhusband.”\n\nThis was too true for contradiction. Unwelcome as it was, Mr. Woodhouse\ncould only give a submissive sigh; and as Emma saw his spirits affected\nby the idea of his daughter's attachment to her husband, she immediately\nled to such a branch of the subject as must raise them.\n\n“Harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my brother\nand sister are here. I am sure she will be pleased with the children.\nWe are very proud of the children, are not we, papa? I wonder which she\nwill think the handsomest, Henry or John?”\n\n“Aye, I wonder which she will. Poor little dears, how glad they will be\nto come. They are very fond of being at Hartfield, Harriet.”\n\n“I dare say they are, sir. I am sure I do not know who is not.”\n\n“Henry is a fine boy, but John is very like his mama. Henry is the\neldest, he was named after me, not after his father. John, the second,\nis named after his father. Some people are surprized, I believe, that\nthe eldest was not, but Isabella would have him called Henry, which I\nthought very pretty of her. And he is a very clever boy, indeed. They\nare all remarkably clever; and they have so many pretty ways. They will\ncome and stand by my chair, and say, 'Grandpapa, can you give me a bit\nof string?' and once Henry asked me for a knife, but I told him knives\nwere only made for grandpapas. I think their father is too rough with\nthem very often.”\n\n“He appears rough to you,” said Emma, “because you are so very gentle\nyourself; but if you could compare him with other papas, you would not\nthink him rough. He wishes his boys to be active and hardy; and if\nthey misbehave, can give them a sharp word now and then; but he is an\naffectionate father--certainly Mr. John Knightley is an affectionate\nfather. The children are all fond of him.”\n\n“And then their uncle comes in, and tosses them up to the ceiling in a\nvery frightful way!”\n\n“But they like it, papa; there is nothing they like so much. It is such\nenjoyment to them, that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of\ntheir taking turns, whichever began would never give way to the other.”\n\n“Well, I cannot understand it.”\n\n“That is the case with us all, papa. One half of the world cannot\nunderstand the pleasures of the other.”\n\nLater in the morning, and just as the girls were going to separate\nin preparation for the regular four o'clock dinner, the hero of this\ninimitable charade walked in again. Harriet turned away; but Emma could\nreceive him with the usual smile, and her quick eye soon discerned in\nhis the consciousness of having made a push--of having thrown a die;\nand she imagined he was come to see how it might turn up. His ostensible\nreason, however, was to ask whether Mr. Woodhouse's party could be made\nup in the evening without him, or whether he should be in the smallest\ndegree necessary at Hartfield. If he were, every thing else must give\nway; but otherwise his friend Cole had been saying so much about his\ndining with him--had made such a point of it, that he had promised him\nconditionally to come.\n\nEmma thanked him, but could not allow of his disappointing his friend\non their account; her father was sure of his rubber. He re-urged--she\nre-declined; and he seemed then about to make his bow, when taking the\npaper from the table, she returned it--\n\n“Oh! here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us; thank\nyou for the sight of it. We admired it so much, that I have ventured\nto write it into Miss Smith's collection. Your friend will not take it\namiss I hope. Of course I have not transcribed beyond the first eight\nlines.”\n\nMr. Elton certainly did not very well know what to say. He looked rather\ndoubtingly--rather confused; said something about “honour,”--glanced at\nEmma and at Harriet, and then seeing the book open on the table, took\nit up, and examined it very attentively. With the view of passing off an\nawkward moment, Emma smilingly said,\n\n“You must make my apologies to your friend; but so good a charade\nmust not be confined to one or two. He may be sure of every woman's\napprobation while he writes with such gallantry.”\n\n“I have no hesitation in saying,” replied Mr. Elton, though hesitating\na good deal while he spoke; “I have no hesitation in saying--at least\nif my friend feels at all as _I_ do--I have not the smallest doubt that,\ncould he see his little effusion honoured as _I_ see it, (looking at the\nbook again, and replacing it on the table), he would consider it as the\nproudest moment of his life.”\n\nAfter this speech he was gone as soon as possible. Emma could not think\nit too soon; for with all his good and agreeable qualities, there was\na sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to\nlaugh. She ran away to indulge the inclination, leaving the tender and\nthe sublime of pleasure to Harriet's share.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\nThough now the middle of December, there had yet been no weather to\nprevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise; and on the\nmorrow, Emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family, who\nlived a little way out of Highbury.\n\nTheir road to this detached cottage was down Vicarage Lane, a lane\nleading at right angles from the broad, though irregular, main street of\nthe place; and, as may be inferred, containing the blessed abode of Mr.\nElton. A few inferior dwellings were first to be passed, and then, about\na quarter of a mile down the lane rose the Vicarage, an old and not\nvery good house, almost as close to the road as it could be. It had\nno advantage of situation; but had been very much smartened up by the\npresent proprietor; and, such as it was, there could be no possibility\nof the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observing\neyes.--Emma's remark was--\n\n“There it is. There go you and your riddle-book one of these\ndays.”--Harriet's was--\n\n“Oh, what a sweet house!--How very beautiful!--There are the yellow\ncurtains that Miss Nash admires so much.”\n\n“I do not often walk this way _now_,” said Emma, as they proceeded, “but\n_then_ there will be an inducement, and I shall gradually get intimately\nacquainted with all the hedges, gates, pools and pollards of this part\nof Highbury.”\n\nHarriet, she found, had never in her life been inside the Vicarage,\nand her curiosity to see it was so extreme, that, considering exteriors\nand probabilities, Emma could only class it, as a proof of love, with\nMr. Elton's seeing ready wit in her.\n\n“I wish we could contrive it,” said she; “but I cannot think of any\ntolerable pretence for going in;--no servant that I want to inquire\nabout of his housekeeper--no message from my father.”\n\nShe pondered, but could think of nothing. After a mutual silence of some\nminutes, Harriet thus began again--\n\n“I do so wonder, Miss Woodhouse, that you should not be married, or\ngoing to be married! so charming as you are!”--\n\nEmma laughed, and replied,\n\n“My being charming, Harriet, is not quite enough to induce me to marry;\nI must find other people charming--one other person at least. And I\nam not only, not going to be married, at present, but have very little\nintention of ever marrying at all.”\n\n“Ah!--so you say; but I cannot believe it.”\n\n“I must see somebody very superior to any one I have seen yet, to be\ntempted; Mr. Elton, you know, (recollecting herself,) is out of the\nquestion: and I do _not_ wish to see any such person. I would rather not\nbe tempted. I cannot really change for the better. If I were to marry, I\nmust expect to repent it.”\n\n“Dear me!--it is so odd to hear a woman talk so!”--\n\n“I have none of the usual inducements of women to marry. Were I to fall\nin love, indeed, it would be a different thing! but I never have been in\nlove; it is not my way, or my nature; and I do not think I ever shall.\nAnd, without love, I am sure I should be a fool to change such a\nsituation as mine. Fortune I do not want; employment I do not want;\nconsequence I do not want: I believe few married women are half as much\nmistress of their husband's house as I am of Hartfield; and never, never\ncould I expect to be so truly beloved and important; so always first and\nalways right in any man's eyes as I am in my father's.”\n\n“But then, to be an old maid at last, like Miss Bates!”\n\n“That is as formidable an image as you could present, Harriet; and if\nI thought I should ever be like Miss Bates! so silly--so satisfied--so\nsmiling--so prosing--so undistinguishing and unfastidious--and so apt\nto tell every thing relative to every body about me, I would marry\nto-morrow. But between _us_, I am convinced there never can be any\nlikeness, except in being unmarried.”\n\n“But still, you will be an old maid! and that's so dreadful!”\n\n“Never mind, Harriet, I shall not be a poor old maid; and it is poverty\nonly which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public! A single\nwoman, with a very narrow income, must be a ridiculous, disagreeable old\nmaid! the proper sport of boys and girls, but a single woman, of good\nfortune, is always respectable, and may be as sensible and pleasant\nas any body else. And the distinction is not quite so much against the\ncandour and common sense of the world as appears at first; for a very\nnarrow income has a tendency to contract the mind, and sour the temper.\nThose who can barely live, and who live perforce in a very small, and\ngenerally very inferior, society, may well be illiberal and cross. This\ndoes not apply, however, to Miss Bates; she is only too good natured and\ntoo silly to suit me; but, in general, she is very much to the taste\nof every body, though single and though poor. Poverty certainly has not\ncontracted her mind: I really believe, if she had only a shilling in the\nworld, she would be very likely to give away sixpence of it; and nobody\nis afraid of her: that is a great charm.”\n\n“Dear me! but what shall you do? how shall you employ yourself when you\ngrow old?”\n\n“If I know myself, Harriet, mine is an active, busy mind, with a great\nmany independent resources; and I do not perceive why I should be more\nin want of employment at forty or fifty than one-and-twenty. Woman's\nusual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they\nare now; or with no important variation. If I draw less, I shall read\nmore; if I give up music, I shall take to carpet-work. And as for\nobjects of interest, objects for the affections, which is in truth the\ngreat point of inferiority, the want of which is really the great evil\nto be avoided in _not_ marrying, I shall be very well off, with all the\nchildren of a sister I love so much, to care about. There will be enough\nof them, in all probability, to supply every sort of sensation that\ndeclining life can need. There will be enough for every hope and every\nfear; and though my attachment to none can equal that of a parent, it\nsuits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder. My\nnephews and nieces!--I shall often have a niece with me.”\n\n“Do you know Miss Bates's niece? That is, I know you must have seen her\na hundred times--but are you acquainted?”\n\n“Oh! yes; we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to\nHighbury. By the bye, _that_ is almost enough to put one out of conceit\nwith a niece. Heaven forbid! at least, that I should ever bore people\nhalf so much about all the Knightleys together, as she does about Jane\nFairfax. One is sick of the very name of Jane Fairfax. Every letter from\nher is read forty times over; her compliments to all friends go round\nand round again; and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of a\nstomacher, or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother, one hears of\nnothing else for a month. I wish Jane Fairfax very well; but she tires\nme to death.”\n\nThey were now approaching the cottage, and all idle topics were\nsuperseded. Emma was very compassionate; and the distresses of the poor\nwere as sure of relief from her personal attention and kindness, her\ncounsel and her patience, as from her purse. She understood their ways,\ncould allow for their ignorance and their temptations, had no romantic\nexpectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had\ndone so little; entered into their troubles with ready sympathy, and\nalways gave her assistance with as much intelligence as good-will. In\nthe present instance, it was sickness and poverty together which she\ncame to visit; and after remaining there as long as she could give\ncomfort or advice, she quitted the cottage with such an impression of\nthe scene as made her say to Harriet, as they walked away,\n\n“These are the sights, Harriet, to do one good. How trifling they make\nevery thing else appear!--I feel now as if I could think of nothing but\nthese poor creatures all the rest of the day; and yet, who can say how\nsoon it may all vanish from my mind?”\n\n“Very true,” said Harriet. “Poor creatures! one can think of nothing\nelse.”\n\n“And really, I do not think the impression will soon be over,” said\nEmma, as she crossed the low hedge, and tottering footstep which ended\nthe narrow, slippery path through the cottage garden, and brought them\ninto the lane again. “I do not think it will,” stopping to look once\nmore at all the outward wretchedness of the place, and recall the still\ngreater within.\n\n“Oh! dear, no,” said her companion.\n\nThey walked on. The lane made a slight bend; and when that bend was\npassed, Mr. Elton was immediately in sight; and so near as to give Emma\ntime only to say farther,\n\n“Ah! Harriet, here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in good\nthoughts. Well, (smiling,) I hope it may be allowed that if compassion\nhas produced exertion and relief to the sufferers, it has done all that\nis truly important. If we feel for the wretched, enough to do all we can\nfor them, the rest is empty sympathy, only distressing to ourselves.”\n\nHarriet could just answer, “Oh! dear, yes,” before the gentleman joined\nthem. The wants and sufferings of the poor family, however, were the\nfirst subject on meeting. He had been going to call on them. His visit\nhe would now defer; but they had a very interesting parley about\nwhat could be done and should be done. Mr. Elton then turned back to\naccompany them.\n\n“To fall in with each other on such an errand as this,” thought Emma;\n“to meet in a charitable scheme; this will bring a great increase\nof love on each side. I should not wonder if it were to bring on the\ndeclaration. It must, if I were not here. I wish I were anywhere else.”\n\nAnxious to separate herself from them as far as she could, she soon\nafterwards took possession of a narrow footpath, a little raised on one\nside of the lane, leaving them together in the main road. But she had\nnot been there two minutes when she found that Harriet's habits of\ndependence and imitation were bringing her up too, and that, in short,\nthey would both be soon after her. This would not do; she immediately\nstopped, under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing\nof her half-boot, and stooping down in complete occupation of the\nfootpath, begged them to have the goodness to walk on, and she would\nfollow in half a minute. They did as they were desired; and by the time\nshe judged it reasonable to have done with her boot, she had the comfort\nof farther delay in her power, being overtaken by a child from the\ncottage, setting out, according to orders, with her pitcher, to fetch\nbroth from Hartfield. To walk by the side of this child, and talk to\nand question her, was the most natural thing in the world, or would have\nbeen the most natural, had she been acting just then without design;\nand by this means the others were still able to keep ahead, without\nany obligation of waiting for her. She gained on them, however,\ninvoluntarily: the child's pace was quick, and theirs rather slow;\nand she was the more concerned at it, from their being evidently in\na conversation which interested them. Mr. Elton was speaking with\nanimation, Harriet listening with a very pleased attention; and Emma,\nhaving sent the child on, was beginning to think how she might draw back\na little more, when they both looked around, and she was obliged to join\nthem.\n\nMr. Elton was still talking, still engaged in some interesting detail;\nand Emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he was only\ngiving his fair companion an account of the yesterday's party at his\nfriend Cole's, and that she was come in herself for the Stilton cheese,\nthe north Wiltshire, the butter, the celery, the beet-root, and all the\ndessert.\n\n“This would soon have led to something better, of course,” was her\nconsoling reflection; “any thing interests between those who love; and\nany thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart. If I\ncould but have kept longer away!”\n\nThey now walked on together quietly, till within view of the vicarage\npales, when a sudden resolution, of at least getting Harriet into the\nhouse, made her again find something very much amiss about her boot, and\nfall behind to arrange it once more. She then broke the lace off short,\nand dexterously throwing it into a ditch, was presently obliged to\nentreat them to stop, and acknowledged her inability to put herself to\nrights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort.\n\n“Part of my lace is gone,” said she, “and I do not know how I am to\ncontrive. I really am a most troublesome companion to you both, but I\nhope I am not often so ill-equipped. Mr. Elton, I must beg leave to stop\nat your house, and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or string,\nor any thing just to keep my boot on.”\n\nMr. Elton looked all happiness at this proposition; and nothing could\nexceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house and\nendeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage. The room they were\ntaken into was the one he chiefly occupied, and looking forwards; behind\nit was another with which it immediately communicated; the door between\nthem was open, and Emma passed into it with the housekeeper to receive\nher assistance in the most comfortable manner. She was obliged to leave\nthe door ajar as she found it; but she fully intended that Mr. Elton\nshould close it. It was not closed, however, it still remained ajar; but\nby engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation, she hoped to make\nit practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining\nroom. For ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself. It could be\nprotracted no longer. She was then obliged to be finished, and make her\nappearance.\n\nThe lovers were standing together at one of the windows. It had a most\nfavourable aspect; and, for half a minute, Emma felt the glory of having\nschemed successfully. But it would not do; he had not come to the point.\nHe had been most agreeable, most delightful; he had told Harriet that\nhe had seen them go by, and had purposely followed them; other little\ngallantries and allusions had been dropt, but nothing serious.\n\n“Cautious, very cautious,” thought Emma; “he advances inch by inch, and\nwill hazard nothing till he believes himself secure.”\n\nStill, however, though every thing had not been accomplished by her\ningenious device, she could not but flatter herself that it had been\nthe occasion of much present enjoyment to both, and must be leading them\nforward to the great event.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\nMr. Elton must now be left to himself. It was no longer in Emma's power\nto superintend his happiness or quicken his measures. The coming of her\nsister's family was so very near at hand, that first in anticipation,\nand then in reality, it became henceforth her prime object of interest;\nand during the ten days of their stay at Hartfield it was not to be\nexpected--she did not herself expect--that any thing beyond occasional,\nfortuitous assistance could be afforded by her to the lovers. They might\nadvance rapidly if they would, however; they must advance somehow or\nother whether they would or no. She hardly wished to have more leisure\nfor them. There are people, who the more you do for them, the less they\nwill do for themselves.\n\nMr. and Mrs. John Knightley, from having been longer than usual absent\nfrom Surry, were exciting of course rather more than the usual interest.\nTill this year, every long vacation since their marriage had been\ndivided between Hartfield and Donwell Abbey; but all the holidays of\nthis autumn had been given to sea-bathing for the children, and it was\ntherefore many months since they had been seen in a regular way by their\nSurry connexions, or seen at all by Mr. Woodhouse, who could not be\ninduced to get so far as London, even for poor Isabella's sake; and\nwho consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy in\nforestalling this too short visit.\n\nHe thought much of the evils of the journey for her, and not a little\nof the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring some\nof the party the last half of the way; but his alarms were needless;\nthe sixteen miles being happily accomplished, and Mr. and Mrs. John\nKnightley, their five children, and a competent number of nursery-maids,\nall reaching Hartfield in safety. The bustle and joy of such an arrival,\nthe many to be talked to, welcomed, encouraged, and variously dispersed\nand disposed of, produced a noise and confusion which his nerves could\nnot have borne under any other cause, nor have endured much longer even\nfor this; but the ways of Hartfield and the feelings of her father\nwere so respected by Mrs. John Knightley, that in spite of maternal\nsolicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones, and for their\nhaving instantly all the liberty and attendance, all the eating and\ndrinking, and sleeping and playing, which they could possibly wish for,\nwithout the smallest delay, the children were never allowed to be long\na disturbance to him, either in themselves or in any restless attendance\non them.\n\nMrs. John Knightley was a pretty, elegant little woman, of gentle, quiet\nmanners, and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate; wrapt\nup in her family; a devoted wife, a doating mother, and so tenderly\nattached to her father and sister that, but for these higher ties, a\nwarmer love might have seemed impossible. She could never see a fault\nin any of them. She was not a woman of strong understanding or any\nquickness; and with this resemblance of her father, she inherited also\nmuch of his constitution; was delicate in her own health, over-careful\nof that of her children, had many fears and many nerves, and was as fond\nof her own Mr. Wingfield in town as her father could be of Mr. Perry.\nThey were alike too, in a general benevolence of temper, and a strong\nhabit of regard for every old acquaintance.\n\nMr. John Knightley was a tall, gentleman-like, and very clever man;\nrising in his profession, domestic, and respectable in his private\ncharacter; but with reserved manners which prevented his being generally\npleasing; and capable of being sometimes out of humour. He was not an\nill-tempered man, not so often unreasonably cross as to deserve such a\nreproach; but his temper was not his great perfection; and, indeed, with\nsuch a worshipping wife, it was hardly possible that any natural defects\nin it should not be increased. The extreme sweetness of her temper\nmust hurt his. He had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she\nwanted, and he could sometimes act an ungracious, or say a severe thing.\n\nHe was not a great favourite with his fair sister-in-law. Nothing wrong\nin him escaped her. She was quick in feeling the little injuries to\nIsabella, which Isabella never felt herself. Perhaps she might have\npassed over more had his manners been flattering to Isabella's sister,\nbut they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend, without\npraise and without blindness; but hardly any degree of personal\ncompliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault of\nall in her eyes which he sometimes fell into, the want of respectful\nforbearance towards her father. There he had not always the patience\nthat could have been wished. Mr. Woodhouse's peculiarities and\nfidgetiness were sometimes provoking him to a rational remonstrance or\nsharp retort equally ill-bestowed. It did not often happen; for Mr. John\nKnightley had really a great regard for his father-in-law, and generally\na strong sense of what was due to him; but it was too often for Emma's\ncharity, especially as there was all the pain of apprehension frequently\nto be endured, though the offence came not. The beginning, however, of\nevery visit displayed none but the properest feelings, and this being of\nnecessity so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality.\nThey had not been long seated and composed when Mr. Woodhouse, with a\nmelancholy shake of the head and a sigh, called his daughter's attention\nto the sad change at Hartfield since she had been there last.\n\n“Ah, my dear,” said he, “poor Miss Taylor--It is a grievous business.”\n\n“Oh yes, sir,” cried she with ready sympathy, “how you must miss her!\nAnd dear Emma, too!--What a dreadful loss to you both!--I have been so\ngrieved for you.--I could not imagine how you could possibly do without\nher.--It is a sad change indeed.--But I hope she is pretty well, sir.”\n\n“Pretty well, my dear--I hope--pretty well.--I do not know but that the\nplace agrees with her tolerably.”\n\nMr. John Knightley here asked Emma quietly whether there were any doubts\nof the air of Randalls.\n\n“Oh! no--none in the least. I never saw Mrs. Weston better in my\nlife--never looking so well. Papa is only speaking his own regret.”\n\n“Very much to the honour of both,” was the handsome reply.\n\n“And do you see her, sir, tolerably often?” asked Isabella in the\nplaintive tone which just suited her father.\n\nMr. Woodhouse hesitated.--“Not near so often, my dear, as I could wish.”\n\n“Oh! papa, we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they\nmarried. Either in the morning or evening of every day, excepting one,\nhave we seen either Mr. Weston or Mrs. Weston, and generally both,\neither at Randalls or here--and as you may suppose, Isabella, most\nfrequently here. They are very, very kind in their visits. Mr. Weston\nis really as kind as herself. Papa, if you speak in that melancholy way,\nyou will be giving Isabella a false idea of us all. Every body must be\naware that Miss Taylor must be missed, but every body ought also to be\nassured that Mr. and Mrs. Weston do really prevent our missing her by\nany means to the extent we ourselves anticipated--which is the exact\ntruth.”\n\n“Just as it should be,” said Mr. John Knightley, “and just as I hoped\nit was from your letters. Her wish of shewing you attention could not be\ndoubted, and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy. I\nhave been always telling you, my love, that I had no idea of the change\nbeing so very material to Hartfield as you apprehended; and now you have\nEmma's account, I hope you will be satisfied.”\n\n“Why, to be sure,” said Mr. Woodhouse--“yes, certainly--I cannot\ndeny that Mrs. Weston, poor Mrs. Weston, does come and see us pretty\noften--but then--she is always obliged to go away again.”\n\n“It would be very hard upon Mr. Weston if she did not, papa.--You quite\nforget poor Mr. Weston.”\n\n“I think, indeed,” said John Knightley pleasantly, “that Mr. Weston has\nsome little claim. You and I, Emma, will venture to take the part of the\npoor husband. I, being a husband, and you not being a wife, the claims\nof the man may very likely strike us with equal force. As for Isabella,\nshe has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all\nthe Mr. Westons aside as much as she can.”\n\n“Me, my love,” cried his wife, hearing and understanding only in part.--\n“Are you talking about me?--I am sure nobody ought to be, or can be, a\ngreater advocate for matrimony than I am; and if it had not been for\nthe misery of her leaving Hartfield, I should never have thought of Miss\nTaylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world; and as to slighting\nMr. Weston, that excellent Mr. Weston, I think there is nothing he does\nnot deserve. I believe he is one of the very best-tempered men that ever\nexisted. Excepting yourself and your brother, I do not know his equal\nfor temper. I shall never forget his flying Henry's kite for him that\nvery windy day last Easter--and ever since his particular kindness last\nSeptember twelvemonth in writing that note, at twelve o'clock at night,\non purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at Cobham, I\nhave been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better\nman in existence.--If any body can deserve him, it must be Miss Taylor.”\n\n“Where is the young man?” said John Knightley. “Has he been here on this\noccasion--or has he not?”\n\n“He has not been here yet,” replied Emma. “There was a strong\nexpectation of his coming soon after the marriage, but it ended in\nnothing; and I have not heard him mentioned lately.”\n\n“But you should tell them of the letter, my dear,” said her father.\n“He wrote a letter to poor Mrs. Weston, to congratulate her, and a very\nproper, handsome letter it was. She shewed it to me. I thought it very\nwell done of him indeed. Whether it was his own idea you know, one\ncannot tell. He is but young, and his uncle, perhaps--”\n\n“My dear papa, he is three-and-twenty. You forget how time passes.”\n\n“Three-and-twenty!--is he indeed?--Well, I could not have thought\nit--and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother! Well,\ntime does fly indeed!--and my memory is very bad. However, it was an\nexceeding good, pretty letter, and gave Mr. and Mrs. Weston a great deal\nof pleasure. I remember it was written from Weymouth, and dated Sept.\n28th--and began, 'My dear Madam,' but I forget how it went on; and it\nwas signed 'F. C. Weston Churchill.'--I remember that perfectly.”\n\n“How very pleasing and proper of him!” cried the good-hearted Mrs. John\nKnightley. “I have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man. But\nhow sad it is that he should not live at home with his father! There is\nsomething so shocking in a child's being taken away from his parents and\nnatural home! I never could comprehend how Mr. Weston could part with\nhim. To give up one's child! I really never could think well of any body\nwho proposed such a thing to any body else.”\n\n“Nobody ever did think well of the Churchills, I fancy,” observed Mr.\nJohn Knightley coolly. “But you need not imagine Mr. Weston to have felt\nwhat you would feel in giving up Henry or John. Mr. Weston is rather\nan easy, cheerful-tempered man, than a man of strong feelings; he takes\nthings as he finds them, and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other,\ndepending, I suspect, much more upon what is called society for his\ncomforts, that is, upon the power of eating and drinking, and playing\nwhist with his neighbours five times a week, than upon family affection,\nor any thing that home affords.”\n\nEmma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr. Weston, and had\nhalf a mind to take it up; but she struggled, and let it pass. She\nwould keep the peace if possible; and there was something honourable and\nvaluable in the strong domestic habits, the all-sufficiency of home to\nhimself, whence resulted her brother's disposition to look down on\nthe common rate of social intercourse, and those to whom it was\nimportant.--It had a high claim to forbearance.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\nMr. Knightley was to dine with them--rather against the inclination of\nMr. Woodhouse, who did not like that any one should share with him in\nIsabella's first day. Emma's sense of right however had decided it;\nand besides the consideration of what was due to each brother, she had\nparticular pleasure, from the circumstance of the late disagreement\nbetween Mr. Knightley and herself, in procuring him the proper\ninvitation.\n\nShe hoped they might now become friends again. She thought it was time\nto make up. Making-up indeed would not do. _She_ certainly had not been\nin the wrong, and _he_ would never own that he had. Concession must be\nout of the question; but it was time to appear to forget that they had\never quarrelled; and she hoped it might rather assist the restoration of\nfriendship, that when he came into the room she had one of the children\nwith her--the youngest, a nice little girl about eight months old, who\nwas now making her first visit to Hartfield, and very happy to be danced\nabout in her aunt's arms. It did assist; for though he began with grave\nlooks and short questions, he was soon led on to talk of them all in\nthe usual way, and to take the child out of her arms with all the\nunceremoniousness of perfect amity. Emma felt they were friends again;\nand the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction, and then\na little sauciness, she could not help saying, as he was admiring the\nbaby,\n\n“What a comfort it is, that we think alike about our nephews and nieces.\nAs to men and women, our opinions are sometimes very different; but with\nregard to these children, I observe we never disagree.”\n\n“If you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and women,\nand as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings with\nthem, as you are where these children are concerned, we might always\nthink alike.”\n\n“To be sure--our discordancies must always arise from my being in the\nwrong.”\n\n“Yes,” said he, smiling--“and reason good. I was sixteen years old when\nyou were born.”\n\n“A material difference then,” she replied--“and no doubt you were much\nmy superior in judgment at that period of our lives; but does not the\nlapse of one-and-twenty years bring our understandings a good deal\nnearer?”\n\n“Yes--a good deal _nearer_.”\n\n“But still, not near enough to give me a chance of being right, if we\nthink differently.”\n\n“I have still the advantage of you by sixteen years' experience, and by\nnot being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child. Come, my dear Emma,\nlet us be friends, and say no more about it. Tell your aunt, little\nEmma, that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing old\ngrievances, and that if she were not wrong before, she is now.”\n\n“That's true,” she cried--“very true. Little Emma, grow up a better\nwoman than your aunt. Be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited.\nNow, Mr. Knightley, a word or two more, and I have done. As far as good\nintentions went, we were _both_ right, and I must say that no effects on\nmy side of the argument have yet proved wrong. I only want to know that\nMr. Martin is not very, very bitterly disappointed.”\n\n“A man cannot be more so,” was his short, full answer.\n\n“Ah!--Indeed I am very sorry.--Come, shake hands with me.”\n\nThis had just taken place and with great cordiality, when John Knightley\nmade his appearance, and “How d'ye do, George?” and “John, how are\nyou?” succeeded in the true English style, burying under a calmness that\nseemed all but indifference, the real attachment which would have led\neither of them, if requisite, to do every thing for the good of the\nother.\n\nThe evening was quiet and conversable, as Mr. Woodhouse declined cards\nentirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear Isabella, and\nthe little party made two natural divisions; on one side he and his\ndaughter; on the other the two Mr. Knightleys; their subjects totally\ndistinct, or very rarely mixing--and Emma only occasionally joining in\none or the other.\n\nThe brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits, but principally\nof those of the elder, whose temper was by much the most communicative,\nand who was always the greater talker. As a magistrate, he had generally\nsome point of law to consult John about, or, at least, some curious\nanecdote to give; and as a farmer, as keeping in hand the home-farm at\nDonwell, he had to tell what every field was to bear next year, and to\ngive all such local information as could not fail of being interesting\nto a brother whose home it had equally been the longest part of his\nlife, and whose attachments were strong. The plan of a drain, the change\nof a fence, the felling of a tree, and the destination of every acre for\nwheat, turnips, or spring corn, was entered into with as much equality\nof interest by John, as his cooler manners rendered possible; and if his\nwilling brother ever left him any thing to inquire about, his inquiries\neven approached a tone of eagerness.\n\nWhile they were thus comfortably occupied, Mr. Woodhouse was enjoying a\nfull flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter.\n\n“My poor dear Isabella,” said he, fondly taking her hand, and\ninterrupting, for a few moments, her busy labours for some one of her\nfive children--“How long it is, how terribly long since you were here!\nAnd how tired you must be after your journey! You must go to bed early,\nmy dear--and I recommend a little gruel to you before you go.--You and\nI will have a nice basin of gruel together. My dear Emma, suppose we all\nhave a little gruel.”\n\nEmma could not suppose any such thing, knowing as she did, that both the\nMr. Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as herself;--and\ntwo basins only were ordered. After a little more discourse in praise of\ngruel, with some wondering at its not being taken every evening by every\nbody, he proceeded to say, with an air of grave reflection,\n\n“It was an awkward business, my dear, your spending the autumn at South\nEnd instead of coming here. I never had much opinion of the sea air.”\n\n“Mr. Wingfield most strenuously recommended it, sir--or we should not\nhave gone. He recommended it for all the children, but particularly for\nthe weakness in little Bella's throat,--both sea air and bathing.”\n\n“Ah! my dear, but Perry had many doubts about the sea doing her any\ngood; and as to myself, I have been long perfectly convinced, though\nperhaps I never told you so before, that the sea is very rarely of use\nto any body. I am sure it almost killed me once.”\n\n“Come, come,” cried Emma, feeling this to be an unsafe subject, “I must\nbeg you not to talk of the sea. It makes me envious and miserable;--I\nwho have never seen it! South End is prohibited, if you please. My dear\nIsabella, I have not heard you make one inquiry about Mr. Perry yet; and\nhe never forgets you.”\n\n“Oh! good Mr. Perry--how is he, sir?”\n\n“Why, pretty well; but not quite well. Poor Perry is bilious, and he has\nnot time to take care of himself--he tells me he has not time to take\ncare of himself--which is very sad--but he is always wanted all round\nthe country. I suppose there is not a man in such practice anywhere. But\nthen there is not so clever a man any where.”\n\n“And Mrs. Perry and the children, how are they? do the children grow?\nI have a great regard for Mr. Perry. I hope he will be calling soon. He\nwill be so pleased to see my little ones.”\n\n“I hope he will be here to-morrow, for I have a question or two to ask\nhim about myself of some consequence. And, my dear, whenever he comes,\nyou had better let him look at little Bella's throat.”\n\n“Oh! my dear sir, her throat is so much better that I have hardly any\nuneasiness about it. Either bathing has been of the greatest service to\nher, or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of Mr.\nWingfield's, which we have been applying at times ever since August.”\n\n“It is not very likely, my dear, that bathing should have been of use\nto her--and if I had known you were wanting an embrocation, I would have\nspoken to--\n\n“You seem to me to have forgotten Mrs. and Miss Bates,” said Emma, “I\nhave not heard one inquiry after them.”\n\n“Oh! the good Bateses--I am quite ashamed of myself--but you mention\nthem in most of your letters. I hope they are quite well. Good old Mrs.\nBates--I will call upon her to-morrow, and take my children.--They\nare always so pleased to see my children.--And that excellent Miss\nBates!--such thorough worthy people!--How are they, sir?”\n\n“Why, pretty well, my dear, upon the whole. But poor Mrs. Bates had a\nbad cold about a month ago.”\n\n“How sorry I am! But colds were never so prevalent as they have been\nthis autumn. Mr. Wingfield told me that he has never known them more\ngeneral or heavy--except when it has been quite an influenza.”\n\n“That has been a good deal the case, my dear; but not to the degree you\nmention. Perry says that colds have been very general, but not so heavy\nas he has very often known them in November. Perry does not call it\naltogether a sickly season.”\n\n“No, I do not know that Mr. Wingfield considers it _very_ sickly\nexcept--\n\n“Ah! my poor dear child, the truth is, that in London it is always\na sickly season. Nobody is healthy in London, nobody can be. It is a\ndreadful thing to have you forced to live there! so far off!--and the\nair so bad!”\n\n“No, indeed--_we_ are not at all in a bad air. Our part of London is\nvery superior to most others!--You must not confound us with London\nin general, my dear sir. The neighbourhood of Brunswick Square is very\ndifferent from almost all the rest. We are so very airy! I should be\nunwilling, I own, to live in any other part of the town;--there is\nhardly any other that I could be satisfied to have my children in:\nbut _we_ are so remarkably airy!--Mr. Wingfield thinks the vicinity of\nBrunswick Square decidedly the most favourable as to air.”\n\n“Ah! my dear, it is not like Hartfield. You make the best of it--but\nafter you have been a week at Hartfield, you are all of you different\ncreatures; you do not look like the same. Now I cannot say, that I think\nyou are any of you looking well at present.”\n\n“I am sorry to hear you say so, sir; but I assure you, excepting those\nlittle nervous head-aches and palpitations which I am never entirely\nfree from anywhere, I am quite well myself; and if the children were\nrather pale before they went to bed, it was only because they were a\nlittle more tired than usual, from their journey and the happiness of\ncoming. I hope you will think better of their looks to-morrow; for I\nassure you Mr. Wingfield told me, that he did not believe he had ever\nsent us off altogether, in such good case. I trust, at least, that\nyou do not think Mr. Knightley looking ill,” turning her eyes with\naffectionate anxiety towards her husband.\n\n“Middling, my dear; I cannot compliment you. I think Mr. John Knightley\nvery far from looking well.”\n\n“What is the matter, sir?--Did you speak to me?” cried Mr. John\nKnightley, hearing his own name.\n\n“I am sorry to find, my love, that my father does not think you looking\nwell--but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued. I could have\nwished, however, as you know, that you had seen Mr. Wingfield before you\nleft home.”\n\n“My dear Isabella,”--exclaimed he hastily--“pray do not concern yourself\nabout my looks. Be satisfied with doctoring and coddling yourself and\nthe children, and let me look as I chuse.”\n\n“I did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother,”\n cried Emma, “about your friend Mr. Graham's intending to have a bailiff\nfrom Scotland, to look after his new estate. What will it answer? Will\nnot the old prejudice be too strong?”\n\nAnd she talked in this way so long and successfully that, when forced to\ngive her attention again to her father and sister, she had nothing\nworse to hear than Isabella's kind inquiry after Jane Fairfax; and Jane\nFairfax, though no great favourite with her in general, she was at that\nmoment very happy to assist in praising.\n\n“That sweet, amiable Jane Fairfax!” said Mrs. John Knightley.--“It\nis so long since I have seen her, except now and then for a moment\naccidentally in town! What happiness it must be to her good old\ngrandmother and excellent aunt, when she comes to visit them! I always\nregret excessively on dear Emma's account that she cannot be more at\nHighbury; but now their daughter is married, I suppose Colonel and Mrs.\nCampbell will not be able to part with her at all. She would be such a\ndelightful companion for Emma.”\n\nMr. Woodhouse agreed to it all, but added,\n\n“Our little friend Harriet Smith, however, is just such another pretty\nkind of young person. You will like Harriet. Emma could not have a\nbetter companion than Harriet.”\n\n“I am most happy to hear it--but only Jane Fairfax one knows to be so\nvery accomplished and superior!--and exactly Emma's age.”\n\nThis topic was discussed very happily, and others succeeded of similar\nmoment, and passed away with similar harmony; but the evening did not\nclose without a little return of agitation. The gruel came and supplied\na great deal to be said--much praise and many comments--undoubting\ndecision of its wholesomeness for every constitution, and pretty\nsevere Philippics upon the many houses where it was never met with\ntolerably;--but, unfortunately, among the failures which the daughter\nhad to instance, the most recent, and therefore most prominent, was in\nher own cook at South End, a young woman hired for the time, who never\nhad been able to understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth\ngruel, thin, but not too thin. Often as she had wished for and ordered\nit, she had never been able to get any thing tolerable. Here was a\ndangerous opening.\n\n“Ah!” said Mr. Woodhouse, shaking his head and fixing his eyes on her\nwith tender concern.--The ejaculation in Emma's ear expressed, “Ah!\nthere is no end of the sad consequences of your going to South End. It\ndoes not bear talking of.” And for a little while she hoped he would not\ntalk of it, and that a silent rumination might suffice to restore him to\nthe relish of his own smooth gruel. After an interval of some minutes,\nhowever, he began with,\n\n“I shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn,\ninstead of coming here.”\n\n“But why should you be sorry, sir?--I assure you, it did the children a\ngreat deal of good.”\n\n“And, moreover, if you must go to the sea, it had better not have been\nto South End. South End is an unhealthy place. Perry was surprized to\nhear you had fixed upon South End.”\n\n“I know there is such an idea with many people, but indeed it is quite\na mistake, sir.--We all had our health perfectly well there, never\nfound the least inconvenience from the mud; and Mr. Wingfield says it is\nentirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy; and I am sure he may\nbe depended on, for he thoroughly understands the nature of the air, and\nhis own brother and family have been there repeatedly.”\n\n“You should have gone to Cromer, my dear, if you went anywhere.--Perry\nwas a week at Cromer once, and he holds it to be the best of all the\nsea-bathing places. A fine open sea, he says, and very pure air. And, by\nwhat I understand, you might have had lodgings there quite away from\nthe sea--a quarter of a mile off--very comfortable. You should have\nconsulted Perry.”\n\n“But, my dear sir, the difference of the journey;--only consider how\ngreat it would have been.--An hundred miles, perhaps, instead of forty.”\n\n“Ah! my dear, as Perry says, where health is at stake, nothing else\nshould be considered; and if one is to travel, there is not much to\nchuse between forty miles and an hundred.--Better not move at all,\nbetter stay in London altogether than travel forty miles to get into\na worse air. This is just what Perry said. It seemed to him a very\nill-judged measure.”\n\nEmma's attempts to stop her father had been vain; and when he\nhad reached such a point as this, she could not wonder at her\nbrother-in-law's breaking out.\n\n“Mr. Perry,” said he, in a voice of very strong displeasure, “would do\nas well to keep his opinion till it is asked for. Why does he make it\nany business of his, to wonder at what I do?--at my taking my family to\none part of the coast or another?--I may be allowed, I hope, the use of\nmy judgment as well as Mr. Perry.--I want his directions no more than\nhis drugs.” He paused--and growing cooler in a moment, added, with only\nsarcastic dryness, “If Mr. Perry can tell me how to convey a wife and\nfive children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater\nexpense or inconvenience than a distance of forty, I should be as\nwilling to prefer Cromer to South End as he could himself.”\n\n“True, true,” cried Mr. Knightley, with most ready interposition--“very\ntrue. That's a consideration indeed.--But John, as to what I was telling\nyou of my idea of moving the path to Langham, of turning it more to the\nright that it may not cut through the home meadows, I cannot conceive\nany difficulty. I should not attempt it, if it were to be the means of\ninconvenience to the Highbury people, but if you call to mind exactly\nthe present line of the path.... The only way of proving it, however,\nwill be to turn to our maps. I shall see you at the Abbey to-morrow\nmorning I hope, and then we will look them over, and you shall give me\nyour opinion.”\n\nMr. Woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on his\nfriend Perry, to whom he had, in fact, though unconsciously, been\nattributing many of his own feelings and expressions;--but the soothing\nattentions of his daughters gradually removed the present evil, and\nthe immediate alertness of one brother, and better recollections of the\nother, prevented any renewal of it.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\nThere could hardly be a happier creature in the world than Mrs. John\nKnightley, in this short visit to Hartfield, going about every morning\namong her old acquaintance with her five children, and talking over what\nshe had done every evening with her father and sister. She had nothing\nto wish otherwise, but that the days did not pass so swiftly. It was a\ndelightful visit;--perfect, in being much too short.\n\nIn general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their\nmornings; but one complete dinner engagement, and out of the house too,\nthere was no avoiding, though at Christmas. Mr. Weston would take no\ndenial; they must all dine at Randalls one day;--even Mr. Woodhouse was\npersuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of\nthe party.\n\nHow they were all to be conveyed, he would have made a difficulty if he\ncould, but as his son and daughter's carriage and horses were actually\nat Hartfield, he was not able to make more than a simple question on\nthat head; it hardly amounted to a doubt; nor did it occupy Emma long\nto convince him that they might in one of the carriages find room for\nHarriet also.\n\nHarriet, Mr. Elton, and Mr. Knightley, their own especial set, were the\nonly persons invited to meet them;--the hours were to be early, as\nwell as the numbers few; Mr. Woodhouse's habits and inclination being\nconsulted in every thing.\n\nThe evening before this great event (for it was a very great event that\nMr. Woodhouse should dine out, on the 24th of December) had been spent\nby Harriet at Hartfield, and she had gone home so much indisposed with\na cold, that, but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by Mrs.\nGoddard, Emma could not have allowed her to leave the house. Emma called\non her the next day, and found her doom already signed with regard to\nRandalls. She was very feverish and had a bad sore throat: Mrs. Goddard\nwas full of care and affection, Mr. Perry was talked of, and Harriet\nherself was too ill and low to resist the authority which excluded her\nfrom this delightful engagement, though she could not speak of her loss\nwithout many tears.\n\nEmma sat with her as long as she could, to attend her in Mrs. Goddard's\nunavoidable absences, and raise her spirits by representing how much Mr.\nElton's would be depressed when he knew her state; and left her at last\ntolerably comfortable, in the sweet dependence of his having a most\ncomfortless visit, and of their all missing her very much. She had not\nadvanced many yards from Mrs. Goddard's door, when she was met by Mr.\nElton himself, evidently coming towards it, and as they walked on slowly\ntogether in conversation about the invalid--of whom he, on the rumour\nof considerable illness, had been going to inquire, that he might\ncarry some report of her to Hartfield--they were overtaken by Mr. John\nKnightley returning from the daily visit to Donwell, with his two eldest\nboys, whose healthy, glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country\nrun, and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice\npudding they were hastening home for. They joined company and\nproceeded together. Emma was just describing the nature of her friend's\ncomplaint;--“a throat very much inflamed, with a great deal of heat\nabout her, a quick, low pulse, &c. and she was sorry to find from Mrs.\nGoddard that Harriet was liable to very bad sore-throats, and had often\nalarmed her with them.” Mr. Elton looked all alarm on the occasion, as\nhe exclaimed,\n\n“A sore-throat!--I hope not infectious. I hope not of a putrid\ninfectious sort. Has Perry seen her? Indeed you should take care of\nyourself as well as of your friend. Let me entreat you to run no risks.\nWhy does not Perry see her?”\n\nEmma, who was not really at all frightened herself, tranquillised this\nexcess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs. Goddard's experience and\ncare; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she\ncould not wish to reason away, which she would rather feed and assist\nthan not, she added soon afterwards--as if quite another subject,\n\n“It is so cold, so very cold--and looks and feels so very much like\nsnow, that if it were to any other place or with any other party, I\nshould really try not to go out to-day--and dissuade my father from\nventuring; but as he has made up his mind, and does not seem to feel the\ncold himself, I do not like to interfere, as I know it would be so great\na disappointment to Mr. and Mrs. Weston. But, upon my word, Mr. Elton,\nin your case, I should certainly excuse myself. You appear to me a\nlittle hoarse already, and when you consider what demand of voice and\nwhat fatigues to-morrow will bring, I think it would be no more than\ncommon prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to-night.”\n\nMr. Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make;\nwhich was exactly the case; for though very much gratified by the kind\ncare of such a fair lady, and not liking to resist any advice of her's,\nhe had not really the least inclination to give up the visit;--but Emma,\ntoo eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear him\nimpartially, or see him with clear vision, was very well satisfied with\nhis muttering acknowledgment of its being “very cold, certainly very\ncold,” and walked on, rejoicing in having extricated him from Randalls,\nand secured him the power of sending to inquire after Harriet every hour\nof the evening.\n\n“You do quite right,” said she;--“we will make your apologies to Mr. and\nMrs. Weston.”\n\nBut hardly had she so spoken, when she found her brother was civilly\noffering a seat in his carriage, if the weather were Mr. Elton's only\nobjection, and Mr. Elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt\nsatisfaction. It was a done thing; Mr. Elton was to go, and never had\nhis broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment;\nnever had his smile been stronger, nor his eyes more exulting than when\nhe next looked at her.\n\n“Well,” said she to herself, “this is most strange!--After I had got\nhim off so well, to chuse to go into company, and leave Harriet ill\nbehind!--Most strange indeed!--But there is, I believe, in many men,\nespecially single men, such an inclination--such a passion for dining\nout--a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures,\ntheir employments, their dignities, almost their duties, that any\nthing gives way to it--and this must be the case with Mr. Elton; a most\nvaluable, amiable, pleasing young man undoubtedly, and very much in love\nwith Harriet; but still, he cannot refuse an invitation, he must dine\nout wherever he is asked. What a strange thing love is! he can see ready\nwit in Harriet, but will not dine alone for her.”\n\nSoon afterwards Mr. Elton quitted them, and she could not but do him\nthe justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in his\nmanner of naming Harriet at parting; in the tone of his voice while\nassuring her that he should call at Mrs. Goddard's for news of her fair\nfriend, the last thing before he prepared for the happiness of meeting\nher again, when he hoped to be able to give a better report; and\nhe sighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance of\napprobation much in his favour.\n\nAfter a few minutes of entire silence between them, John Knightley began\nwith--\n\n“I never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than Mr.\nElton. It is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned. With\nmen he can be rational and unaffected, but when he has ladies to please,\nevery feature works.”\n\n“Mr. Elton's manners are not perfect,” replied Emma; “but where there is\na wish to please, one ought to overlook, and one does overlook a great\ndeal. Where a man does his best with only moderate powers, he will\nhave the advantage over negligent superiority. There is such perfect\ngood-temper and good-will in Mr. Elton as one cannot but value.”\n\n“Yes,” said Mr. John Knightley presently, with some slyness, “he seems\nto have a great deal of good-will towards you.”\n\n“Me!” she replied with a smile of astonishment, “are you imagining me to\nbe Mr. Elton's object?”\n\n“Such an imagination has crossed me, I own, Emma; and if it never\noccurred to you before, you may as well take it into consideration now.”\n\n“Mr. Elton in love with me!--What an idea!”\n\n“I do not say it is so; but you will do well to consider whether it\nis so or not, and to regulate your behaviour accordingly. I think your\nmanners to him encouraging. I speak as a friend, Emma. You had better\nlook about you, and ascertain what you do, and what you mean to do.”\n\n“I thank you; but I assure you you are quite mistaken. Mr. Elton and\nI are very good friends, and nothing more;” and she walked on, amusing\nherself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a\npartial knowledge of circumstances, of the mistakes which people of high\npretensions to judgment are for ever falling into; and not very well\npleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant, and in\nwant of counsel. He said no more.\n\nMr. Woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit, that in\nspite of the increasing coldness, he seemed to have no idea of shrinking\nfrom it, and set forward at last most punctually with his eldest\ndaughter in his own carriage, with less apparent consciousness of the\nweather than either of the others; too full of the wonder of his own\ngoing, and the pleasure it was to afford at Randalls to see that it was\ncold, and too well wrapt up to feel it. The cold, however, was severe;\nand by the time the second carriage was in motion, a few flakes of snow\nwere finding their way down, and the sky had the appearance of being so\novercharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very white world\nin a very short time.\n\nEmma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour. The\npreparing and the going abroad in such weather, with the sacrifice of\nhis children after dinner, were evils, were disagreeables at least,\nwhich Mr. John Knightley did not by any means like; he anticipated\nnothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase; and the\nwhole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing his\ndiscontent.\n\n“A man,” said he, “must have a very good opinion of himself when he asks\npeople to leave their own fireside, and encounter such a day as\nthis, for the sake of coming to see him. He must think himself a most\nagreeable fellow; I could not do such a thing. It is the greatest\nabsurdity--Actually snowing at this moment!--The folly of not allowing\npeople to be comfortable at home--and the folly of people's not staying\ncomfortably at home when they can! If we were obliged to go out such\nan evening as this, by any call of duty or business, what a hardship we\nshould deem it;--and here are we, probably with rather thinner clothing\nthan usual, setting forward voluntarily, without excuse, in defiance of\nthe voice of nature, which tells man, in every thing given to his view\nor his feelings, to stay at home himself, and keep all under shelter\nthat he can;--here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in\nanother man's house, with nothing to say or to hear that was not said\nand heard yesterday, and may not be said and heard again to-morrow.\nGoing in dismal weather, to return probably in worse;--four horses and\nfour servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle, shivering\ncreatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have had\nat home.”\n\nEmma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent, which no\ndoubt he was in the habit of receiving, to emulate the “Very true,\nmy love,” which must have been usually administered by his travelling\ncompanion; but she had resolution enough to refrain from making\nany answer at all. She could not be complying, she dreaded being\nquarrelsome; her heroism reached only to silence. She allowed him to\ntalk, and arranged the glasses, and wrapped herself up, without opening\nher lips.\n\nThey arrived, the carriage turned, the step was let down, and Mr. Elton,\nspruce, black, and smiling, was with them instantly. Emma thought with\npleasure of some change of subject. Mr. Elton was all obligation and\ncheerfulness; he was so very cheerful in his civilities indeed, that she\nbegan to think he must have received a different account of Harriet from\nwhat had reached her. She had sent while dressing, and the answer had\nbeen, “Much the same--not better.”\n\n“_My_ report from Mrs. Goddard's,” said she presently, “was not so\npleasant as I had hoped--'Not better' was _my_ answer.”\n\nHis face lengthened immediately; and his voice was the voice of\nsentiment as he answered.\n\n“Oh! no--I am grieved to find--I was on the point of telling you that\nwhen I called at Mrs. Goddard's door, which I did the very last thing\nbefore I returned to dress, I was told that Miss Smith was not better,\nby no means better, rather worse. Very much grieved and concerned--I\nhad flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial as I\nknew had been given her in the morning.”\n\nEmma smiled and answered--“My visit was of use to the nervous part of\nher complaint, I hope; but not even I can charm away a sore throat;\nit is a most severe cold indeed. Mr. Perry has been with her, as you\nprobably heard.”\n\n“Yes--I imagined--that is--I did not--”\n\n“He has been used to her in these complaints, and I hope to-morrow\nmorning will bring us both a more comfortable report. But it is\nimpossible not to feel uneasiness. Such a sad loss to our party to-day!”\n\n“Dreadful!--Exactly so, indeed.--She will be missed every moment.”\n\nThis was very proper; the sigh which accompanied it was really\nestimable; but it should have lasted longer. Emma was rather in dismay\nwhen only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things,\nand in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment.\n\n“What an excellent device,” said he, “the use of a sheepskin for\ncarriages. How very comfortable they make it;--impossible to feel cold\nwith such precautions. The contrivances of modern days indeed have\nrendered a gentleman's carriage perfectly complete. One is so fenced\nand guarded from the weather, that not a breath of air can find its way\nunpermitted. Weather becomes absolutely of no consequence. It is a very\ncold afternoon--but in this carriage we know nothing of the matter.--Ha!\nsnows a little I see.”\n\n“Yes,” said John Knightley, “and I think we shall have a good deal of\nit.”\n\n“Christmas weather,” observed Mr. Elton. “Quite seasonable; and\nextremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin\nyesterday, and prevent this day's party, which it might very possibly\nhave done, for Mr. Woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been\nmuch snow on the ground; but now it is of no consequence. This is quite\nthe season indeed for friendly meetings. At Christmas every body invites\ntheir friends about them, and people think little of even the worst\nweather. I was snowed up at a friend's house once for a week. Nothing\ncould be pleasanter. I went for only one night, and could not get away\ntill that very day se'nnight.”\n\nMr. John Knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure, but\nsaid only, coolly,\n\n“I cannot wish to be snowed up a week at Randalls.”\n\nAt another time Emma might have been amused, but she was too much\nastonished now at Mr. Elton's spirits for other feelings. Harriet seemed\nquite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party.\n\n“We are sure of excellent fires,” continued he, “and every thing in the\ngreatest comfort. Charming people, Mr. and Mrs. Weston;--Mrs. Weston\nindeed is much beyond praise, and he is exactly what one values, so\nhospitable, and so fond of society;--it will be a small party, but where\nsmall parties are select, they are perhaps the most agreeable of any.\nMr. Weston's dining-room does not accommodate more than ten comfortably;\nand for my part, I would rather, under such circumstances, fall short by\ntwo than exceed by two. I think you will agree with me, (turning with\na soft air to Emma,) I think I shall certainly have your approbation,\nthough Mr. Knightley perhaps, from being used to the large parties of\nLondon, may not quite enter into our feelings.”\n\n“I know nothing of the large parties of London, sir--I never dine with\nany body.”\n\n“Indeed! (in a tone of wonder and pity,) I had no idea that the law had\nbeen so great a slavery. Well, sir, the time must come when you will\nbe paid for all this, when you will have little labour and great\nenjoyment.”\n\n“My first enjoyment,” replied John Knightley, as they passed through the\nsweep-gate, “will be to find myself safe at Hartfield again.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\nSome change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they\nwalked into Mrs. Weston's drawing-room;--Mr. Elton must compose his\njoyous looks, and Mr. John Knightley disperse his ill-humour. Mr.\nElton must smile less, and Mr. John Knightley more, to fit them for the\nplace.--Emma only might be as nature prompted, and shew herself just as\nhappy as she was. To her it was real enjoyment to be with the Westons.\nMr. Weston was a great favourite, and there was not a creature in the\nworld to whom she spoke with such unreserve, as to his wife; not any\none, to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to and\nunderstood, of being always interesting and always intelligible, the\nlittle affairs, arrangements, perplexities, and pleasures of her father\nand herself. She could tell nothing of Hartfield, in which Mrs. Weston\nhad not a lively concern; and half an hour's uninterrupted communication\nof all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private life\ndepends, was one of the first gratifications of each.\n\nThis was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day's visit might not\nafford, which certainly did not belong to the present half-hour; but the\nvery sight of Mrs. Weston, her smile, her touch, her voice was grateful\nto Emma, and she determined to think as little as possible of Mr.\nElton's oddities, or of any thing else unpleasant, and enjoy all that\nwas enjoyable to the utmost.\n\nThe misfortune of Harriet's cold had been pretty well gone through\nbefore her arrival. Mr. Woodhouse had been safely seated long enough\nto give the history of it, besides all the history of his own and\nIsabella's coming, and of Emma's being to follow, and had indeed just\ngot to the end of his satisfaction that James should come and see his\ndaughter, when the others appeared, and Mrs. Weston, who had been almost\nwholly engrossed by her attentions to him, was able to turn away and\nwelcome her dear Emma.\n\nEmma's project of forgetting Mr. Elton for a while made her rather sorry\nto find, when they had all taken their places, that he was close to her.\nThe difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards\nHarriet, from her mind, while he not only sat at her elbow, but\nwas continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice, and\nsolicitously addressing her upon every occasion. Instead of forgetting\nhim, his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal\nsuggestion of “Can it really be as my brother imagined? can it be\npossible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from\nHarriet to me?--Absurd and insufferable!”--Yet he would be so anxious\nfor her being perfectly warm, would be so interested about her father,\nand so delighted with Mrs. Weston; and at last would begin admiring her\ndrawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly\nlike a would-be lover, and made it some effort with her to preserve her\ngood manners. For her own sake she could not be rude; and for Harriet's,\nin the hope that all would yet turn out right, she was even positively\ncivil; but it was an effort; especially as something was going on\namongst the others, in the most overpowering period of Mr. Elton's\nnonsense, which she particularly wished to listen to. She heard enough\nto know that Mr. Weston was giving some information about his son; she\nheard the words “my son,” and “Frank,” and “my son,” repeated several\ntimes over; and, from a few other half-syllables very much suspected\nthat he was announcing an early visit from his son; but before she could\nquiet Mr. Elton, the subject was so completely past that any reviving\nquestion from her would have been awkward.\n\nNow, it so happened that in spite of Emma's resolution of never\nmarrying, there was something in the name, in the idea of Mr.\nFrank Churchill, which always interested her. She had frequently\nthought--especially since his father's marriage with Miss Taylor--that\nif she _were_ to marry, he was the very person to suit her in age,\ncharacter and condition. He seemed by this connexion between the\nfamilies, quite to belong to her. She could not but suppose it to be\na match that every body who knew them must think of. That Mr. and Mrs.\nWeston did think of it, she was very strongly persuaded; and though\nnot meaning to be induced by him, or by any body else, to give up a\nsituation which she believed more replete with good than any she could\nchange it for, she had a great curiosity to see him, a decided intention\nof finding him pleasant, of being liked by him to a certain degree, and\na sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in their friends'\nimaginations.\n\nWith such sensations, Mr. Elton's civilities were dreadfully ill-timed;\nbut she had the comfort of appearing very polite, while feeling very\ncross--and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly\npass without bringing forward the same information again, or the\nsubstance of it, from the open-hearted Mr. Weston.--So it proved;--for\nwhen happily released from Mr. Elton, and seated by Mr. Weston,\nat dinner, he made use of the very first interval in the cares of\nhospitality, the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton, to say to\nher,\n\n“We want only two more to be just the right number. I should like to see\ntwo more here,--your pretty little friend, Miss Smith, and my son--and\nthen I should say we were quite complete. I believe you did not hear me\ntelling the others in the drawing-room that we are expecting Frank.\nI had a letter from him this morning, and he will be with us within a\nfortnight.”\n\nEmma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure; and fully assented to\nhis proposition of Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Smith making their party\nquite complete.\n\n“He has been wanting to come to us,” continued Mr. Weston, “ever since\nSeptember: every letter has been full of it; but he cannot command his\nown time. He has those to please who must be pleased, and who (between\nourselves) are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices.\nBut now I have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in\nJanuary.”\n\n“What a very great pleasure it will be to you! and Mrs. Weston is so\nanxious to be acquainted with him, that she must be almost as happy as\nyourself.”\n\n“Yes, she would be, but that she thinks there will be another put-off.\nShe does not depend upon his coming so much as I do: but she does not\nknow the parties so well as I do. The case, you see, is--(but this is\nquite between ourselves: I did not mention a syllable of it in the other\nroom. There are secrets in all families, you know)--The case is, that a\nparty of friends are invited to pay a visit at Enscombe in January; and\nthat Frank's coming depends upon their being put off. If they are not\nput off, he cannot stir. But I know they will, because it is a family\nthat a certain lady, of some consequence, at Enscombe, has a particular\ndislike to: and though it is thought necessary to invite them once in\ntwo or three years, they always are put off when it comes to the point.\nI have not the smallest doubt of the issue. I am as confident of seeing\nFrank here before the middle of January, as I am of being here myself:\nbut your good friend there (nodding towards the upper end of the table)\nhas so few vagaries herself, and has been so little used to them at\nHartfield, that she cannot calculate on their effects, as I have been\nlong in the practice of doing.”\n\n“I am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case,” replied\nEmma; “but am disposed to side with you, Mr. Weston. If you think he\nwill come, I shall think so too; for you know Enscombe.”\n\n“Yes--I have some right to that knowledge; though I have never been at\nthe place in my life.--She is an odd woman!--But I never allow myself\nto speak ill of her, on Frank's account; for I do believe her to be very\nfond of him. I used to think she was not capable of being fond of\nany body, except herself: but she has always been kind to him (in her\nway--allowing for little whims and caprices, and expecting every thing\nto be as she likes). And it is no small credit, in my opinion, to him,\nthat he should excite such an affection; for, though I would not say\nit to any body else, she has no more heart than a stone to people in\ngeneral; and the devil of a temper.”\n\nEmma liked the subject so well, that she began upon it, to Mrs. Weston,\nvery soon after their moving into the drawing-room: wishing her joy--yet\nobserving, that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming.--\nMrs. Weston agreed to it; but added, that she should be very glad to be\nsecure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked\nof: “for I cannot depend upon his coming. I cannot be so sanguine as\nMr. Weston. I am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing. Mr.\nWeston, I dare say, has been telling you exactly how the matter stands?”\n\n“Yes--it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill-humour of Mrs.\nChurchill, which I imagine to be the most certain thing in the world.”\n\n“My Emma!” replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, “what is the certainty\nof caprice?” Then turning to Isabella, who had not been attending\nbefore--“You must know, my dear Mrs. Knightley, that we are by no means\nso sure of seeing Mr. Frank Churchill, in my opinion, as his father\nthinks. It depends entirely upon his aunt's spirits and pleasure; in\nshort, upon her temper. To you--to my two daughters--I may venture on\nthe truth. Mrs. Churchill rules at Enscombe, and is a very odd-tempered\nwoman; and his coming now, depends upon her being willing to spare him.”\n\n“Oh, Mrs. Churchill; every body knows Mrs. Churchill,” replied Isabella:\n“and I am sure I never think of that poor young man without the greatest\ncompassion. To be constantly living with an ill-tempered person, must\nbe dreadful. It is what we happily have never known any thing of; but\nit must be a life of misery. What a blessing, that she never had any\nchildren! Poor little creatures, how unhappy she would have made them!”\n\nEmma wished she had been alone with Mrs. Weston. She should then have\nheard more: Mrs. Weston would speak to her, with a degree of unreserve\nwhich she would not hazard with Isabella; and, she really believed,\nwould scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the Churchills\nfrom her, excepting those views on the young man, of which her own\nimagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge. But at\npresent there was nothing more to be said. Mr. Woodhouse very soon\nfollowed them into the drawing-room. To be sitting long after\ndinner, was a confinement that he could not endure. Neither wine nor\nconversation was any thing to him; and gladly did he move to those with\nwhom he was always comfortable.\n\nWhile he talked to Isabella, however, Emma found an opportunity of\nsaying,\n\n“And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means\ncertain. I am sorry for it. The introduction must be unpleasant,\nwhenever it takes place; and the sooner it could be over, the better.”\n\n“Yes; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays. Even\nif this family, the Braithwaites, are put off, I am still afraid that\nsome excuse may be found for disappointing us. I cannot bear to imagine\nany reluctance on his side; but I am sure there is a great wish on\nthe Churchills' to keep him to themselves. There is jealousy. They\nare jealous even of his regard for his father. In short, I can feel no\ndependence on his coming, and I wish Mr. Weston were less sanguine.”\n\n“He ought to come,” said Emma. “If he could stay only a couple of days,\nhe ought to come; and one can hardly conceive a young man's not having\nit in his power to do as much as that. A young _woman_, if she fall into\nbad hands, may be teased, and kept at a distance from those she wants\nto be with; but one cannot comprehend a young _man_'s being under such\nrestraint, as not to be able to spend a week with his father, if he\nlikes it.”\n\n“One ought to be at Enscombe, and know the ways of the family, before\none decides upon what he can do,” replied Mrs. Weston. “One ought to\nuse the same caution, perhaps, in judging of the conduct of any one\nindividual of any one family; but Enscombe, I believe, certainly must\nnot be judged by general rules: _she_ is so very unreasonable; and every\nthing gives way to her.”\n\n“But she is so fond of the nephew: he is so very great a favourite. Now,\naccording to my idea of Mrs. Churchill, it would be most natural, that\nwhile she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband, to whom she\nowes every thing, while she exercises incessant caprice towards _him_,\nshe should frequently be governed by the nephew, to whom she owes\nnothing at all.”\n\n“My dearest Emma, do not pretend, with your sweet temper, to understand\na bad one, or to lay down rules for it: you must let it go its own way.\nI have no doubt of his having, at times, considerable influence; but it\nmay be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand _when_ it will\nbe.”\n\nEmma listened, and then coolly said, “I shall not be satisfied, unless\nhe comes.”\n\n“He may have a great deal of influence on some points,” continued Mrs.\nWeston, “and on others, very little: and among those, on which she is\nbeyond his reach, it is but too likely, may be this very circumstance of\nhis coming away from them to visit us.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n\nMr. Woodhouse was soon ready for his tea; and when he had drank his\ntea he was quite ready to go home; and it was as much as his three\ncompanions could do, to entertain away his notice of the lateness of\nthe hour, before the other gentlemen appeared. Mr. Weston was chatty and\nconvivial, and no friend to early separations of any sort; but at last\nthe drawing-room party did receive an augmentation. Mr. Elton, in very\ngood spirits, was one of the first to walk in. Mrs. Weston and Emma\nwere sitting together on a sofa. He joined them immediately, and, with\nscarcely an invitation, seated himself between them.\n\nEmma, in good spirits too, from the amusement afforded her mind by\nthe expectation of Mr. Frank Churchill, was willing to forget his late\nimproprieties, and be as well satisfied with him as before, and on his\nmaking Harriet his very first subject, was ready to listen with most\nfriendly smiles.\n\nHe professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend--her fair,\nlovely, amiable friend. “Did she know?--had she heard any thing about\nher, since their being at Randalls?--he felt much anxiety--he must\nconfess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably.”\n And in this style he talked on for some time very properly, not much\nattending to any answer, but altogether sufficiently awake to the terror\nof a bad sore throat; and Emma was quite in charity with him.\n\nBut at last there seemed a perverse turn; it seemed all at once as if he\nwere more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account, than on\nHarriet's--more anxious that she should escape the infection, than\nthat there should be no infection in the complaint. He began with great\nearnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick-chamber\nagain, for the present--to entreat her to _promise_ _him_ not to venture\ninto such hazard till he had seen Mr. Perry and learnt his opinion; and\nthough she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its\nproper course, there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude\nabout her. She was vexed. It did appear--there was no concealing\nit--exactly like the pretence of being in love with her, instead of\nHarriet; an inconstancy, if real, the most contemptible and abominable!\nand she had difficulty in behaving with temper. He turned to Mrs. Weston\nto implore her assistance, “Would not she give him her support?--would\nnot she add her persuasions to his, to induce Miss Woodhouse not to go\nto Mrs. Goddard's till it were certain that Miss Smith's disorder had\nno infection? He could not be satisfied without a promise--would not she\ngive him her influence in procuring it?”\n\n“So scrupulous for others,” he continued, “and yet so careless for\nherself! She wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to-day, and\nyet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore\nthroat herself. Is this fair, Mrs. Weston?--Judge between us. Have not I\nsome right to complain? I am sure of your kind support and aid.”\n\nEmma saw Mrs. Weston's surprize, and felt that it must be great, at an\naddress which, in words and manner, was assuming to himself the right of\nfirst interest in her; and as for herself, she was too much provoked and\noffended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the purpose.\nShe could only give him a look; but it was such a look as she thought\nmust restore him to his senses, and then left the sofa, removing to a\nseat by her sister, and giving her all her attention.\n\nShe had not time to know how Mr. Elton took the reproof, so rapidly did\nanother subject succeed; for Mr. John Knightley now came into the room\nfrom examining the weather, and opened on them all with the information\nof the ground being covered with snow, and of its still snowing\nfast, with a strong drifting wind; concluding with these words to Mr.\nWoodhouse:\n\n“This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements,\nsir. Something new for your coachman and horses to be making their way\nthrough a storm of snow.”\n\nPoor Mr. Woodhouse was silent from consternation; but every body else\nhad something to say; every body was either surprized or not surprized,\nand had some question to ask, or some comfort to offer. Mrs. Weston\nand Emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention from his\nson-in-law, who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly.\n\n“I admired your resolution very much, sir,” said he, “in venturing out\nin such weather, for of course you saw there would be snow very soon.\nEvery body must have seen the snow coming on. I admired your spirit; and\nI dare say we shall get home very well. Another hour or two's snow can\nhardly make the road impassable; and we are two carriages; if one is\nblown over in the bleak part of the common field there will be the other\nat hand. I dare say we shall be all safe at Hartfield before midnight.”\n\nMr. Weston, with triumph of a different sort, was confessing that he\nhad known it to be snowing some time, but had not said a word, lest\nit should make Mr. Woodhouse uncomfortable, and be an excuse for his\nhurrying away. As to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely\nto fall to impede their return, that was a mere joke; he was afraid they\nwould find no difficulty. He wished the road might be impassable, that\nhe might be able to keep them all at Randalls; and with the utmost\ngood-will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body,\ncalling on his wife to agree with him, that with a little contrivance,\nevery body might be lodged, which she hardly knew how to do, from the\nconsciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house.\n\n“What is to be done, my dear Emma?--what is to be done?” was Mr.\nWoodhouse's first exclamation, and all that he could say for some\ntime. To her he looked for comfort; and her assurances of safety, her\nrepresentation of the excellence of the horses, and of James, and of\ntheir having so many friends about them, revived him a little.\n\nHis eldest daughter's alarm was equal to his own. The horror of being\nblocked up at Randalls, while her children were at Hartfield, was full\nin her imagination; and fancying the road to be now just passable for\nadventurous people, but in a state that admitted no delay, she was eager\nto have it settled, that her father and Emma should remain at Randalls,\nwhile she and her husband set forward instantly through all the possible\naccumulations of drifted snow that might impede them.\n\n“You had better order the carriage directly, my love,” said she; “I dare\nsay we shall be able to get along, if we set off directly; and if we\ndo come to any thing very bad, I can get out and walk. I am not at all\nafraid. I should not mind walking half the way. I could change my shoes,\nyou know, the moment I got home; and it is not the sort of thing that\ngives me cold.”\n\n“Indeed!” replied he. “Then, my dear Isabella, it is the most\nextraordinary sort of thing in the world, for in general every thing\ndoes give you cold. Walk home!--you are prettily shod for walking home,\nI dare say. It will be bad enough for the horses.”\n\nIsabella turned to Mrs. Weston for her approbation of the plan. Mrs.\nWeston could only approve. Isabella then went to Emma; but Emma could\nnot so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away;\nand they were still discussing the point, when Mr. Knightley, who had\nleft the room immediately after his brother's first report of the snow,\ncame back again, and told them that he had been out of doors to examine,\nand could answer for there not being the smallest difficulty in their\ngetting home, whenever they liked it, either now or an hour hence. He\nhad gone beyond the sweep--some way along the Highbury road--the snow\nwas nowhere above half an inch deep--in many places hardly enough to\nwhiten the ground; a very few flakes were falling at present, but the\nclouds were parting, and there was every appearance of its being soon\nover. He had seen the coachmen, and they both agreed with him in there\nbeing nothing to apprehend.\n\nTo Isabella, the relief of such tidings was very great, and they were\nscarcely less acceptable to Emma on her father's account, who\nwas immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous\nconstitution allowed; but the alarm that had been raised could not be\nappeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at\nRandalls. He was satisfied of there being no present danger in returning\nhome, but no assurances could convince him that it was safe to stay; and\nwhile the others were variously urging and recommending, Mr. Knightley\nand Emma settled it in a few brief sentences: thus--\n\n“Your father will not be easy; why do not you go?”\n\n“I am ready, if the others are.”\n\n“Shall I ring the bell?”\n\n“Yes, do.”\n\nAnd the bell was rung, and the carriages spoken for. A few minutes more,\nand Emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his own\nhouse, to get sober and cool, and the other recover his temper and\nhappiness when this visit of hardship were over.\n\nThe carriage came: and Mr. Woodhouse, always the first object on such\noccasions, was carefully attended to his own by Mr. Knightley and Mr.\nWeston; but not all that either could say could prevent some renewal\nof alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen, and the\ndiscovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for. “He was\nafraid they should have a very bad drive. He was afraid poor Isabella\nwould not like it. And there would be poor Emma in the carriage behind.\nHe did not know what they had best do. They must keep as much together\nas they could;” and James was talked to, and given a charge to go very\nslow and wait for the other carriage.\n\nIsabella stept in after her father; John Knightley, forgetting that he\ndid not belong to their party, stept in after his wife very naturally;\nso that Emma found, on being escorted and followed into the second\ncarriage by Mr. Elton, that the door was to be lawfully shut on them,\nand that they were to have a tete-a-tete drive. It would not have been\nthe awkwardness of a moment, it would have been rather a pleasure,\nprevious to the suspicions of this very day; she could have talked to\nhim of Harriet, and the three-quarters of a mile would have seemed but\none. But now, she would rather it had not happened. She believed he had\nbeen drinking too much of Mr. Weston's good wine, and felt sure that he\nwould want to be talking nonsense.\n\nTo restrain him as much as might be, by her own manners, she was\nimmediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of\nthe weather and the night; but scarcely had she begun, scarcely had they\npassed the sweep-gate and joined the other carriage, than she found her\nsubject cut up--her hand seized--her attention demanded, and Mr. Elton\nactually making violent love to her: availing himself of the precious\nopportunity, declaring sentiments which must be already well known,\nhoping--fearing--adoring--ready to die if she refused him; but\nflattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and\nunexampled passion could not fail of having some effect, and in short,\nvery much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible. It\nreally was so. Without scruple--without apology--without much apparent\ndiffidence, Mr. Elton, the lover of Harriet, was professing himself\n_her_ lover. She tried to stop him; but vainly; he would go on, and say\nit all. Angry as she was, the thought of the moment made her resolve to\nrestrain herself when she did speak. She felt that half this folly must\nbe drunkenness, and therefore could hope that it might belong only to\nthe passing hour. Accordingly, with a mixture of the serious and the\nplayful, which she hoped would best suit his half and half state, she\nreplied,\n\n“I am very much astonished, Mr. Elton. This to _me_! you forget\nyourself--you take me for my friend--any message to Miss Smith I shall\nbe happy to deliver; but no more of this to _me_, if you please.”\n\n“Miss Smith!--message to Miss Smith!--What could she possibly\nmean!”--And he repeated her words with such assurance of accent, such\nboastful pretence of amazement, that she could not help replying with\nquickness,\n\n“Mr. Elton, this is the most extraordinary conduct! and I can account\nfor it only in one way; you are not yourself, or you could not speak\neither to me, or of Harriet, in such a manner. Command yourself enough\nto say no more, and I will endeavour to forget it.”\n\nBut Mr. Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits, not at\nall to confuse his intellects. He perfectly knew his own meaning; and\nhaving warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious, and\nslightly touched upon his respect for Miss Smith as her friend,--but\nacknowledging his wonder that Miss Smith should be mentioned at all,--he\nresumed the subject of his own passion, and was very urgent for a\nfavourable answer.\n\nAs she thought less of his inebriety, she thought more of his\ninconstancy and presumption; and with fewer struggles for politeness,\nreplied,\n\n“It is impossible for me to doubt any longer. You have made yourself\ntoo clear. Mr. Elton, my astonishment is much beyond any thing I can\nexpress. After such behaviour, as I have witnessed during the last\nmonth, to Miss Smith--such attentions as I have been in the daily\nhabit of observing--to be addressing me in this manner--this is an\nunsteadiness of character, indeed, which I had not supposed possible!\nBelieve me, sir, I am far, very far, from gratified in being the object\nof such professions.”\n\n“Good Heaven!” cried Mr. Elton, “what can be the meaning of this?--Miss\nSmith!--I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course of my\nexistence--never paid her any attentions, but as your friend: never\ncared whether she were dead or alive, but as your friend. If she\nhas fancied otherwise, her own wishes have misled her, and I am very\nsorry--extremely sorry--But, Miss Smith, indeed!--Oh! Miss Woodhouse!\nwho can think of Miss Smith, when Miss Woodhouse is near! No, upon my\nhonour, there is no unsteadiness of character. I have thought only of\nyou. I protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one\nelse. Every thing that I have said or done, for many weeks past, has\nbeen with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself. You\ncannot really, seriously, doubt it. No!--(in an accent meant to be\ninsinuating)--I am sure you have seen and understood me.”\n\nIt would be impossible to say what Emma felt, on hearing this--which\nof all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost. She was too completely\noverpowered to be immediately able to reply: and two moments of silence\nbeing ample encouragement for Mr. Elton's sanguine state of mind, he\ntried to take her hand again, as he joyously exclaimed--\n\n“Charming Miss Woodhouse! allow me to interpret this interesting\nsilence. It confesses that you have long understood me.”\n\n“No, sir,” cried Emma, “it confesses no such thing. So far from having\nlong understood you, I have been in a most complete error with respect\nto your views, till this moment. As to myself, I am very sorry that you\nshould have been giving way to any feelings--Nothing could be farther\nfrom my wishes--your attachment to my friend Harriet--your pursuit of\nher, (pursuit, it appeared,) gave me great pleasure, and I have been\nvery earnestly wishing you success: but had I supposed that she were not\nyour attraction to Hartfield, I should certainly have thought you judged\nill in making your visits so frequent. Am I to believe that you have\nnever sought to recommend yourself particularly to Miss Smith?--that you\nhave never thought seriously of her?”\n\n“Never, madam,” cried he, affronted in his turn: “never, I assure you.\n_I_ think seriously of Miss Smith!--Miss Smith is a very good sort of\ngirl; and I should be happy to see her respectably settled. I wish\nher extremely well: and, no doubt, there are men who might not object\nto--Every body has their level: but as for myself, I am not, I think,\nquite so much at a loss. I need not so totally despair of an equal\nalliance, as to be addressing myself to Miss Smith!--No, madam, my\nvisits to Hartfield have been for yourself only; and the encouragement I\nreceived--”\n\n“Encouragement!--I give you encouragement!--Sir, you have been entirely\nmistaken in supposing it. I have seen you only as the admirer of my\nfriend. In no other light could you have been more to me than a common\nacquaintance. I am exceedingly sorry: but it is well that the mistake\nends where it does. Had the same behaviour continued, Miss Smith might\nhave been led into a misconception of your views; not being aware,\nprobably, any more than myself, of the very great inequality which you\nare so sensible of. But, as it is, the disappointment is single, and, I\ntrust, will not be lasting. I have no thoughts of matrimony at present.”\n\nHe was too angry to say another word; her manner too decided to invite\nsupplication; and in this state of swelling resentment, and mutually\ndeep mortification, they had to continue together a few minutes longer,\nfor the fears of Mr. Woodhouse had confined them to a foot-pace. If\nthere had not been so much anger, there would have been desperate\nawkwardness; but their straightforward emotions left no room for the\nlittle zigzags of embarrassment. Without knowing when the carriage\nturned into Vicarage Lane, or when it stopped, they found themselves,\nall at once, at the door of his house; and he was out before another\nsyllable passed.--Emma then felt it indispensable to wish him a good\nnight. The compliment was just returned, coldly and proudly; and, under\nindescribable irritation of spirits, she was then conveyed to Hartfield.\n\nThere she was welcomed, with the utmost delight, by her father, who\nhad been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from Vicarage\nLane--turning a corner which he could never bear to think of--and in\nstrange hands--a mere common coachman--no James; and there it seemed as\nif her return only were wanted to make every thing go well: for Mr.\nJohn Knightley, ashamed of his ill-humour, was now all kindness and\nattention; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her\nfather, as to seem--if not quite ready to join him in a basin of\ngruel--perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome; and the\nday was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party,\nexcept herself.--But her mind had never been in such perturbation; and\nit needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till the\nusual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\nThe hair was curled, and the maid sent away, and Emma sat down to think\nand be miserable.--It was a wretched business indeed!--Such an overthrow\nof every thing she had been wishing for!--Such a development of every\nthing most unwelcome!--Such a blow for Harriet!--that was the worst\nof all. Every part of it brought pain and humiliation, of some sort or\nother; but, compared with the evil to Harriet, all was light; and\nshe would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken--more in\nerror--more disgraced by mis-judgment, than she actually was, could the\neffects of her blunders have been confined to herself.\n\n“If I had not persuaded Harriet into liking the man, I could have\nborne any thing. He might have doubled his presumption to me--but poor\nHarriet!”\n\nHow she could have been so deceived!--He protested that he had never\nthought seriously of Harriet--never! She looked back as well as\nshe could; but it was all confusion. She had taken up the idea, she\nsupposed, and made every thing bend to it. His manners, however, must\nhave been unmarked, wavering, dubious, or she could not have been so\nmisled.\n\nThe picture!--How eager he had been about the picture!--and the\ncharade!--and an hundred other circumstances;--how clearly they had\nseemed to point at Harriet. To be sure, the charade, with its “ready\nwit”--but then the “soft eyes”--in fact it suited neither; it was\na jumble without taste or truth. Who could have seen through such\nthick-headed nonsense?\n\nCertainly she had often, especially of late, thought his manners to\nherself unnecessarily gallant; but it had passed as his way, as a mere\nerror of judgment, of knowledge, of taste, as one proof among others\nthat he had not always lived in the best society, that with all the\ngentleness of his address, true elegance was sometimes wanting; but,\ntill this very day, she had never, for an instant, suspected it to mean\nany thing but grateful respect to her as Harriet's friend.\n\nTo Mr. John Knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the\nsubject, for the first start of its possibility. There was no denying\nthat those brothers had penetration. She remembered what Mr. Knightley\nhad once said to her about Mr. Elton, the caution he had given,\nthe conviction he had professed that Mr. Elton would never marry\nindiscreetly; and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his\ncharacter had been there shewn than any she had reached herself. It\nwas dreadfully mortifying; but Mr. Elton was proving himself, in many\nrespects, the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him;\nproud, assuming, conceited; very full of his own claims, and little\nconcerned about the feelings of others.\n\nContrary to the usual course of things, Mr. Elton's wanting to pay his\naddresses to her had sunk him in her opinion. His professions and his\nproposals did him no service. She thought nothing of his attachment,\nand was insulted by his hopes. He wanted to marry well, and having the\narrogance to raise his eyes to her, pretended to be in love; but she was\nperfectly easy as to his not suffering any disappointment that need be\ncared for. There had been no real affection either in his language or\nmanners. Sighs and fine words had been given in abundance; but she could\nhardly devise any set of expressions, or fancy any tone of voice, less\nallied with real love. She need not trouble herself to pity him. He\nonly wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself; and if Miss Woodhouse\nof Hartfield, the heiress of thirty thousand pounds, were not quite so\neasily obtained as he had fancied, he would soon try for Miss Somebody\nelse with twenty, or with ten.\n\nBut--that he should talk of encouragement, should consider her as aware\nof his views, accepting his attentions, meaning (in short), to marry\nhim!--should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind!--look down\nupon her friend, so well understanding the gradations of rank below\nhim, and be so blind to what rose above, as to fancy himself shewing no\npresumption in addressing her!--It was most provoking.\n\nPerhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her\ninferior in talent, and all the elegancies of mind. The very want of\nsuch equality might prevent his perception of it; but he must know that\nin fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior. He must\nknow that the Woodhouses had been settled for several generations at\nHartfield, the younger branch of a very ancient family--and that the\nEltons were nobody. The landed property of Hartfield certainly was\ninconsiderable, being but a sort of notch in the Donwell Abbey estate,\nto which all the rest of Highbury belonged; but their fortune, from\nother sources, was such as to make them scarcely secondary to Donwell\nAbbey itself, in every other kind of consequence; and the Woodhouses had\nlong held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which\nMr. Elton had first entered not two years ago, to make his way as he\ncould, without any alliances but in trade, or any thing to recommend him\nto notice but his situation and his civility.--But he had fancied her\nin love with him; that evidently must have been his dependence; and\nafter raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners\nand a conceited head, Emma was obliged in common honesty to stop\nand admit that her own behaviour to him had been so complaisant and\nobliging, so full of courtesy and attention, as (supposing her real\nmotive unperceived) might warrant a man of ordinary observation and\ndelicacy, like Mr. Elton, in fancying himself a very decided favourite.\nIf _she_ had so misinterpreted his feelings, she had little right to\nwonder that _he_, with self-interest to blind him, should have mistaken\nhers.\n\nThe first error and the worst lay at her door. It was foolish, it was\nwrong, to take so active a part in bringing any two people together. It\nwas adventuring too far, assuming too much, making light of what\nought to be serious, a trick of what ought to be simple. She was quite\nconcerned and ashamed, and resolved to do such things no more.\n\n“Here have I,” said she, “actually talked poor Harriet into being very\nmuch attached to this man. She might never have thought of him but for\nme; and certainly never would have thought of him with hope, if I had\nnot assured her of his attachment, for she is as modest and humble as I\nused to think him. Oh! that I had been satisfied with persuading her not\nto accept young Martin. There I was quite right. That was well done\nof me; but there I should have stopped, and left the rest to time and\nchance. I was introducing her into good company, and giving her the\nopportunity of pleasing some one worth having; I ought not to have\nattempted more. But now, poor girl, her peace is cut up for some time.\nI have been but half a friend to her; and if she were _not_ to feel this\ndisappointment so very much, I am sure I have not an idea of any body\nelse who would be at all desirable for her;--William Coxe--Oh! no, I\ncould not endure William Coxe--a pert young lawyer.”\n\nShe stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse, and then resumed a more\nserious, more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been, and might be,\nand must be. The distressing explanation she had to make to Harriet, and\nall that poor Harriet would be suffering, with the awkwardness of\nfuture meetings, the difficulties of continuing or discontinuing the\nacquaintance, of subduing feelings, concealing resentment, and avoiding\neclat, were enough to occupy her in most unmirthful reflections some\ntime longer, and she went to bed at last with nothing settled but the\nconviction of her having blundered most dreadfully.\n\nTo youth and natural cheerfulness like Emma's, though under temporary\ngloom at night, the return of day will hardly fail to bring return of\nspirits. The youth and cheerfulness of morning are in happy analogy,\nand of powerful operation; and if the distress be not poignant enough\nto keep the eyes unclosed, they will be sure to open to sensations of\nsoftened pain and brighter hope.\n\nEmma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had gone\nto bed, more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her, and to\ndepend on getting tolerably out of it.\n\nIt was a great consolation that Mr. Elton should not be really in\nlove with her, or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to\ndisappoint him--that Harriet's nature should not be of that superior\nsort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive--and that there\ncould be no necessity for any body's knowing what had passed except the\nthree principals, and especially for her father's being given a moment's\nuneasiness about it.\n\nThese were very cheering thoughts; and the sight of a great deal of snow\non the ground did her further service, for any thing was welcome that\nmight justify their all three being quite asunder at present.\n\nThe weather was most favourable for her; though Christmas Day, she\ncould not go to church. Mr. Woodhouse would have been miserable had his\ndaughter attempted it, and she was therefore safe from either exciting\nor receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas. The ground covered\nwith snow, and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and\nthaw, which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise, every\nmorning beginning in rain or snow, and every evening setting in to\nfreeze, she was for many days a most honourable prisoner. No intercourse\nwith Harriet possible but by note; no church for her on Sunday any\nmore than on Christmas Day; and no need to find excuses for Mr. Elton's\nabsenting himself.\n\nIt was weather which might fairly confine every body at home; and though\nshe hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some society\nor other, it was very pleasant to have her father so well satisfied with\nhis being all alone in his own house, too wise to stir out; and to\nhear him say to Mr. Knightley, whom no weather could keep entirely from\nthem,--\n\n“Ah! Mr. Knightley, why do not you stay at home like poor Mr. Elton?”\n\nThese days of confinement would have been, but for her private\nperplexities, remarkably comfortable, as such seclusion exactly suited\nher brother, whose feelings must always be of great importance to\nhis companions; and he had, besides, so thoroughly cleared off his\nill-humour at Randalls, that his amiableness never failed him during the\nrest of his stay at Hartfield. He was always agreeable and obliging,\nand speaking pleasantly of every body. But with all the hopes of\ncheerfulness, and all the present comfort of delay, there was still such\nan evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation with Harriet, as\nmade it impossible for Emma to be ever perfectly at ease.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n\nMr. and Mrs. John Knightley were not detained long at Hartfield. The\nweather soon improved enough for those to move who must move; and Mr.\nWoodhouse having, as usual, tried to persuade his daughter to stay\nbehind with all her children, was obliged to see the whole party\nset off, and return to his lamentations over the destiny of poor\nIsabella;--which poor Isabella, passing her life with those she doated\non, full of their merits, blind to their faults, and always innocently\nbusy, might have been a model of right feminine happiness.\n\nThe evening of the very day on which they went brought a note from Mr.\nElton to Mr. Woodhouse, a long, civil, ceremonious note, to say, with\nMr. Elton's best compliments, “that he was proposing to leave Highbury\nthe following morning in his way to Bath; where, in compliance with\nthe pressing entreaties of some friends, he had engaged to spend a few\nweeks, and very much regretted the impossibility he was under, from\nvarious circumstances of weather and business, of taking a personal\nleave of Mr. Woodhouse, of whose friendly civilities he should ever\nretain a grateful sense--and had Mr. Woodhouse any commands, should be\nhappy to attend to them.”\n\nEmma was most agreeably surprized.--Mr. Elton's absence just at this\ntime was the very thing to be desired. She admired him for contriving\nit, though not able to give him much credit for the manner in which it\nwas announced. Resentment could not have been more plainly spoken than\nin a civility to her father, from which she was so pointedly excluded.\nShe had not even a share in his opening compliments.--Her name was not\nmentioned;--and there was so striking a change in all this, and such an\nill-judged solemnity of leave-taking in his graceful acknowledgments, as\nshe thought, at first, could not escape her father's suspicion.\n\nIt did, however.--Her father was quite taken up with the surprize of so\nsudden a journey, and his fears that Mr. Elton might never get safely to\nthe end of it, and saw nothing extraordinary in his language. It was a\nvery useful note, for it supplied them with fresh matter for thought\nand conversation during the rest of their lonely evening. Mr. Woodhouse\ntalked over his alarms, and Emma was in spirits to persuade them away\nwith all her usual promptitude.\n\nShe now resolved to keep Harriet no longer in the dark. She had reason\nto believe her nearly recovered from her cold, and it was desirable that\nshe should have as much time as possible for getting the better of\nher other complaint before the gentleman's return. She went to Mrs.\nGoddard's accordingly the very next day, to undergo the necessary\npenance of communication; and a severe one it was.--She had to destroy\nall the hopes which she had been so industriously feeding--to appear in\nthe ungracious character of the one preferred--and acknowledge herself\ngrossly mistaken and mis-judging in all her ideas on one subject, all\nher observations, all her convictions, all her prophecies for the last\nsix weeks.\n\nThe confession completely renewed her first shame--and the sight of\nHarriet's tears made her think that she should never be in charity with\nherself again.\n\nHarriet bore the intelligence very well--blaming nobody--and in every\nthing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly opinion\nof herself, as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to\nher friend.\n\nEmma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost;\nand all that was amiable, all that ought to be attaching, seemed on\nHarriet's side, not her own. Harriet did not consider herself as having\nany thing to complain of. The affection of such a man as Mr. Elton\nwould have been too great a distinction.--She never could have deserved\nhim--and nobody but so partial and kind a friend as Miss Woodhouse would\nhave thought it possible.\n\nHer tears fell abundantly--but her grief was so truly artless, that\nno dignity could have made it more respectable in Emma's eyes--and\nshe listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and\nunderstanding--really for the time convinced that Harriet was the\nsuperior creature of the two--and that to resemble her would be more for\nher own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence could\ndo.\n\nIt was rather too late in the day to set about being simple-minded and\nignorant; but she left her with every previous resolution confirmed of\nbeing humble and discreet, and repressing imagination all the rest of\nher life. Her second duty now, inferior only to her father's claims, was\nto promote Harriet's comfort, and endeavour to prove her own affection\nin some better method than by match-making. She got her to Hartfield,\nand shewed her the most unvarying kindness, striving to occupy and\namuse her, and by books and conversation, to drive Mr. Elton from her\nthoughts.\n\nTime, she knew, must be allowed for this being thoroughly done; and\nshe could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in\ngeneral, and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to Mr. Elton\nin particular; but it seemed to her reasonable that at Harriet's age,\nand with the entire extinction of all hope, such a progress might be\nmade towards a state of composure by the time of Mr. Elton's return, as\nto allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance,\nwithout any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them.\n\nHarriet did think him all perfection, and maintained the non-existence\nof any body equal to him in person or goodness--and did, in truth,\nprove herself more resolutely in love than Emma had foreseen; but yet\nit appeared to her so natural, so inevitable to strive against an\ninclination of that sort _unrequited_, that she could not comprehend its\ncontinuing very long in equal force.\n\nIf Mr. Elton, on his return, made his own indifference as evident and\nindubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do, she could not\nimagine Harriet's persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the\nrecollection of him.\n\nTheir being fixed, so absolutely fixed, in the same place, was bad for\neach, for all three. Not one of them had the power of removal, or of\neffecting any material change of society. They must encounter each\nother, and make the best of it.\n\nHarriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at Mrs.\nGoddard's; Mr. Elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great\ngirls in the school; and it must be at Hartfield only that she could\nhave any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or\nrepellent truth. Where the wound had been given, there must the cure be\nfound if anywhere; and Emma felt that, till she saw her in the way of\ncure, there could be no true peace for herself.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n\nMr. Frank Churchill did not come. When the time proposed drew near, Mrs.\nWeston's fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of excuse. For\nthe present, he could not be spared, to his “very great mortification\nand regret; but still he looked forward with the hope of coming to\nRandalls at no distant period.”\n\nMrs. Weston was exceedingly disappointed--much more disappointed, in\nfact, than her husband, though her dependence on seeing the young man\nhad been so much more sober: but a sanguine temper, though for ever\nexpecting more good than occurs, does not always pay for its hopes by\nany proportionate depression. It soon flies over the present failure,\nand begins to hope again. For half an hour Mr. Weston was surprized and\nsorry; but then he began to perceive that Frank's coming two or three\nmonths later would be a much better plan; better time of year;\nbetter weather; and that he would be able, without any doubt, to stay\nconsiderably longer with them than if he had come sooner.\n\nThese feelings rapidly restored his comfort, while Mrs. Weston, of\na more apprehensive disposition, foresaw nothing but a repetition of\nexcuses and delays; and after all her concern for what her husband was\nto suffer, suffered a great deal more herself.\n\nEmma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about Mr.\nFrank Churchill's not coming, except as a disappointment at Randalls.\nThe acquaintance at present had no charm for her. She wanted, rather, to\nbe quiet, and out of temptation; but still, as it was desirable that she\nshould appear, in general, like her usual self, she took care to express\nas much interest in the circumstance, and enter as warmly into Mr.\nand Mrs. Weston's disappointment, as might naturally belong to their\nfriendship.\n\nShe was the first to announce it to Mr. Knightley; and exclaimed quite\nas much as was necessary, (or, being acting a part, perhaps rather\nmore,) at the conduct of the Churchills, in keeping him away. She then\nproceeded to say a good deal more than she felt, of the advantage of\nsuch an addition to their confined society in Surry; the pleasure of\nlooking at somebody new; the gala-day to Highbury entire, which the\nsight of him would have made; and ending with reflections on the\nChurchills again, found herself directly involved in a disagreement\nwith Mr. Knightley; and, to her great amusement, perceived that she was\ntaking the other side of the question from her real opinion, and making\nuse of Mrs. Weston's arguments against herself.\n\n“The Churchills are very likely in fault,” said Mr. Knightley, coolly;\n“but I dare say he might come if he would.”\n\n“I do not know why you should say so. He wishes exceedingly to come; but\nhis uncle and aunt will not spare him.”\n\n“I cannot believe that he has not the power of coming, if he made a\npoint of it. It is too unlikely, for me to believe it without proof.”\n\n“How odd you are! What has Mr. Frank Churchill done, to make you suppose\nhim such an unnatural creature?”\n\n“I am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature, in suspecting that\nhe may have learnt to be above his connexions, and to care very little\nfor any thing but his own pleasure, from living with those who have\nalways set him the example of it. It is a great deal more natural than\none could wish, that a young man, brought up by those who are proud,\nluxurious, and selfish, should be proud, luxurious, and selfish too. If\nFrank Churchill had wanted to see his father, he would have contrived it\nbetween September and January. A man at his age--what is he?--three or\nfour-and-twenty--cannot be without the means of doing as much as that.\nIt is impossible.”\n\n“That's easily said, and easily felt by you, who have always been your\nown master. You are the worst judge in the world, Mr. Knightley, of the\ndifficulties of dependence. You do not know what it is to have tempers\nto manage.”\n\n“It is not to be conceived that a man of three or four-and-twenty\nshould not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount. He cannot want\nmoney--he cannot want leisure. We know, on the contrary, that he has so\nmuch of both, that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts in\nthe kingdom. We hear of him for ever at some watering-place or other. A\nlittle while ago, he was at Weymouth. This proves that he can leave the\nChurchills.”\n\n“Yes, sometimes he can.”\n\n“And those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while; whenever\nthere is any temptation of pleasure.”\n\n“It is very unfair to judge of any body's conduct, without an intimate\nknowledge of their situation. Nobody, who has not been in the interior\nof a family, can say what the difficulties of any individual of that\nfamily may be. We ought to be acquainted with Enscombe, and with Mrs.\nChurchill's temper, before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew\ncan do. He may, at times, be able to do a great deal more than he can at\nothers.”\n\n“There is one thing, Emma, which a man can always do, if he chuses, and\nthat is, his duty; not by manoeuvring and finessing, but by vigour and\nresolution. It is Frank Churchill's duty to pay this attention to his\nfather. He knows it to be so, by his promises and messages; but if he\nwished to do it, it might be done. A man who felt rightly would say at\nonce, simply and resolutely, to Mrs. Churchill--'Every sacrifice of\nmere pleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience;\nbut I must go and see my father immediately. I know he would be hurt by\nmy failing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion.\nI shall, therefore, set off to-morrow.'--If he would say so to her\nat once, in the tone of decision becoming a man, there would be no\nopposition made to his going.”\n\n“No,” said Emma, laughing; “but perhaps there might be some made to his\ncoming back again. Such language for a young man entirely dependent, to\nuse!--Nobody but you, Mr. Knightley, would imagine it possible. But you\nhave not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite to\nyour own. Mr. Frank Churchill to be making such a speech as that to\nthe uncle and aunt, who have brought him up, and are to provide for\nhim!--Standing up in the middle of the room, I suppose, and speaking as\nloud as he could!--How can you imagine such conduct practicable?”\n\n“Depend upon it, Emma, a sensible man would find no difficulty in it. He\nwould feel himself in the right; and the declaration--made, of course,\nas a man of sense would make it, in a proper manner--would do him more\ngood, raise him higher, fix his interest stronger with the people he\ndepended on, than all that a line of shifts and expedients can ever do.\nRespect would be added to affection. They would feel that they could\ntrust him; that the nephew who had done rightly by his father, would do\nrightly by them; for they know, as well as he does, as well as all the\nworld must know, that he ought to pay this visit to his father; and\nwhile meanly exerting their power to delay it, are in their hearts not\nthinking the better of him for submitting to their whims. Respect for\nright conduct is felt by every body. If he would act in this sort of\nmanner, on principle, consistently, regularly, their little minds would\nbend to his.”\n\n“I rather doubt that. You are very fond of bending little minds; but\nwhere little minds belong to rich people in authority, I think they have\na knack of swelling out, till they are quite as unmanageable as great\nones. I can imagine, that if you, as you are, Mr. Knightley, were to be\ntransported and placed all at once in Mr. Frank Churchill's situation,\nyou would be able to say and do just what you have been recommending for\nhim; and it might have a very good effect. The Churchills might not have\na word to say in return; but then, you would have no habits of early\nobedience and long observance to break through. To him who has, it might\nnot be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence, and set\nall their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought. He may have as\nstrong a sense of what would be right, as you can have, without being so\nequal, under particular circumstances, to act up to it.”\n\n“Then it would not be so strong a sense. If it failed to produce equal\nexertion, it could not be an equal conviction.”\n\n“Oh, the difference of situation and habit! I wish you would try to\nunderstand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly\nopposing those, whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his\nlife.”\n\n“Our amiable young man is a very weak young man, if this be the first\noccasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against the\nwill of others. It ought to have been a habit with him by this time, of\nfollowing his duty, instead of consulting expediency. I can allow for\nthe fears of the child, but not of the man. As he became rational, he\nought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in\ntheir authority. He ought to have opposed the first attempt on their\nside to make him slight his father. Had he begun as he ought, there\nwould have been no difficulty now.”\n\n“We shall never agree about him,” cried Emma; “but that is nothing\nextraordinary. I have not the least idea of his being a weak young man:\nI feel sure that he is not. Mr. Weston would not be blind to folly,\nthough in his own son; but he is very likely to have a more yielding,\ncomplying, mild disposition than would suit your notions of man's\nperfection. I dare say he has; and though it may cut him off from some\nadvantages, it will secure him many others.”\n\n“Yes; all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move, and\nof leading a life of mere idle pleasure, and fancying himself extremely\nexpert in finding excuses for it. He can sit down and write a fine\nflourishing letter, full of professions and falsehoods, and persuade\nhimself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world of\npreserving peace at home and preventing his father's having any right to\ncomplain. His letters disgust me.”\n\n“Your feelings are singular. They seem to satisfy every body else.”\n\n“I suspect they do not satisfy Mrs. Weston. They hardly can satisfy\na woman of her good sense and quick feelings: standing in a mother's\nplace, but without a mother's affection to blind her. It is on her\naccount that attention to Randalls is doubly due, and she must doubly\nfeel the omission. Had she been a person of consequence herself, he\nwould have come I dare say; and it would not have signified whether\nhe did or no. Can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of\nconsiderations? Do you suppose she does not often say all this to\nherself? No, Emma, your amiable young man can be amiable only in French,\nnot in English. He may be very 'amiable,' have very good manners, and be\nvery agreeable; but he can have no English delicacy towards the feelings\nof other people: nothing really amiable about him.”\n\n“You seem determined to think ill of him.”\n\n“Me!--not at all,” replied Mr. Knightley, rather displeased; “I do not\nwant to think ill of him. I should be as ready to acknowledge his merits\nas any other man; but I hear of none, except what are merely personal;\nthat he is well-grown and good-looking, with smooth, plausible manners.”\n\n“Well, if he have nothing else to recommend him, he will be a treasure\nat Highbury. We do not often look upon fine young men, well-bred and\nagreeable. We must not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the\nbargain. Cannot you imagine, Mr. Knightley, what a _sensation_ his\ncoming will produce? There will be but one subject throughout the\nparishes of Donwell and Highbury; but one interest--one object of\ncuriosity; it will be all Mr. Frank Churchill; we shall think and speak\nof nobody else.”\n\n“You will excuse my being so much over-powered. If I find him\nconversable, I shall be glad of his acquaintance; but if he is only a\nchattering coxcomb, he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts.”\n\n“My idea of him is, that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of\nevery body, and has the power as well as the wish of being universally\nagreeable. To you, he will talk of farming; to me, of drawing or music;\nand so on to every body, having that general information on all subjects\nwhich will enable him to follow the lead, or take the lead, just as\npropriety may require, and to speak extremely well on each; that is my\nidea of him.”\n\n“And mine,” said Mr. Knightley warmly, “is, that if he turn out any\nthing like it, he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing! What!\nat three-and-twenty to be the king of his company--the great man--the\npractised politician, who is to read every body's character, and make\nevery body's talents conduce to the display of his own superiority; to\nbe dispensing his flatteries around, that he may make all appear like\nfools compared with himself! My dear Emma, your own good sense could not\nendure such a puppy when it came to the point.”\n\n“I will say no more about him,” cried Emma, “you turn every thing to\nevil. We are both prejudiced; you against, I for him; and we have no\nchance of agreeing till he is really here.”\n\n“Prejudiced! I am not prejudiced.”\n\n“But I am very much, and without being at all ashamed of it. My love for\nMr. and Mrs. Weston gives me a decided prejudice in his favour.”\n\n“He is a person I never think of from one month's end to another,” said\nMr. Knightley, with a degree of vexation, which made Emma immediately\ntalk of something else, though she could not comprehend why he should be\nangry.\n\nTo take a dislike to a young man, only because he appeared to be of a\ndifferent disposition from himself, was unworthy the real liberality of\nmind which she was always used to acknowledge in him; for with all the\nhigh opinion of himself, which she had often laid to his charge, she had\nnever before for a moment supposed it could make him unjust to the merit\nof another.\n\n\n\n\nVOLUME II\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nEmma and Harriet had been walking together one morning, and, in Emma's\nopinion, had been talking enough of Mr. Elton for that day. She could\nnot think that Harriet's solace or her own sins required more; and\nshe was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they\nreturned;--but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded,\nand after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter, and\nreceiving no other answer than a very plaintive--“Mr. Elton is so good\nto the poor!” she found something else must be done.\n\nThey were just approaching the house where lived Mrs. and Miss Bates.\nShe determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers. There was\nalways sufficient reason for such an attention; Mrs. and Miss Bates\nloved to be called on, and she knew she was considered by the very few\nwho presumed ever to see imperfection in her, as rather negligent in\nthat respect, and as not contributing what she ought to the stock of\ntheir scanty comforts.\n\nShe had had many a hint from Mr. Knightley and some from her own heart,\nas to her deficiency--but none were equal to counteract the persuasion\nof its being very disagreeable,--a waste of time--tiresome women--and\nall the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second-rate and\nthird-rate of Highbury, who were calling on them for ever, and therefore\nshe seldom went near them. But now she made the sudden resolution of not\npassing their door without going in--observing, as she proposed it to\nHarriet, that, as well as she could calculate, they were just now quite\nsafe from any letter from Jane Fairfax.\n\nThe house belonged to people in business. Mrs. and Miss Bates occupied\nthe drawing-room floor; and there, in the very moderate-sized apartment,\nwhich was every thing to them, the visitors were most cordially and even\ngratefully welcomed; the quiet neat old lady, who with her knitting was\nseated in the warmest corner, wanting even to give up her place to\nMiss Woodhouse, and her more active, talking daughter, almost ready\nto overpower them with care and kindness, thanks for their visit,\nsolicitude for their shoes, anxious inquiries after Mr. Woodhouse's\nhealth, cheerful communications about her mother's, and sweet-cake from\nthe beaufet--“Mrs. Cole had just been there, just called in for ten\nminutes, and had been so good as to sit an hour with them, and _she_ had\ntaken a piece of cake and been so kind as to say she liked it very much;\nand, therefore, she hoped Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith would do them\nthe favour to eat a piece too.”\n\nThe mention of the Coles was sure to be followed by that of Mr. Elton.\nThere was intimacy between them, and Mr. Cole had heard from Mr. Elton\nsince his going away. Emma knew what was coming; they must have the\nletter over again, and settle how long he had been gone, and how much\nhe was engaged in company, and what a favourite he was wherever he went,\nand how full the Master of the Ceremonies' ball had been; and she went\nthrough it very well, with all the interest and all the commendation\nthat could be requisite, and always putting forward to prevent Harriet's\nbeing obliged to say a word.\n\nThis she had been prepared for when she entered the house; but meant,\nhaving once talked him handsomely over, to be no farther incommoded by\nany troublesome topic, and to wander at large amongst all the Mistresses\nand Misses of Highbury, and their card-parties. She had not been\nprepared to have Jane Fairfax succeed Mr. Elton; but he was actually\nhurried off by Miss Bates, she jumped away from him at last abruptly to\nthe Coles, to usher in a letter from her niece.\n\n“Oh! yes--Mr. Elton, I understand--certainly as to dancing--Mrs. Cole\nwas telling me that dancing at the rooms at Bath was--Mrs. Cole was so\nkind as to sit some time with us, talking of Jane; for as soon as\nshe came in, she began inquiring after her, Jane is so very great a\nfavourite there. Whenever she is with us, Mrs. Cole does not know how to\nshew her kindness enough; and I must say that Jane deserves it as much\nas any body can. And so she began inquiring after her directly, saying,\n'I know you cannot have heard from Jane lately, because it is not her\ntime for writing;' and when I immediately said, 'But indeed we have, we\nhad a letter this very morning,' I do not know that I ever saw any body\nmore surprized. 'Have you, upon your honour?' said she; 'well, that is\nquite unexpected. Do let me hear what she says.'”\n\nEmma's politeness was at hand directly, to say, with smiling interest--\n\n“Have you heard from Miss Fairfax so lately? I am extremely happy. I\nhope she is well?”\n\n“Thank you. You are so kind!” replied the happily deceived aunt, while\neagerly hunting for the letter.--“Oh! here it is. I was sure it could\nnot be far off; but I had put my huswife upon it, you see, without being\naware, and so it was quite hid, but I had it in my hand so very lately\nthat I was almost sure it must be on the table. I was reading it to Mrs.\nCole, and since she went away, I was reading it again to my mother, for\nit is such a pleasure to her--a letter from Jane--that she can never\nhear it often enough; so I knew it could not be far off, and here it is,\nonly just under my huswife--and since you are so kind as to wish to hear\nwhat she says;--but, first of all, I really must, in justice to\nJane, apologise for her writing so short a letter--only two pages you\nsee--hardly two--and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses\nhalf. My mother often wonders that I can make it out so well. She often\nsays, when the letter is first opened, 'Well, Hetty, now I think\nyou will be put to it to make out all that checker-work'--don't you,\nma'am?--And then I tell her, I am sure she would contrive to make it out\nherself, if she had nobody to do it for her--every word of it--I am sure\nshe would pore over it till she had made out every word. And, indeed,\nthough my mother's eyes are not so good as they were, she can see\namazingly well still, thank God! with the help of spectacles. It is such\na blessing! My mother's are really very good indeed. Jane often says,\nwhen she is here, 'I am sure, grandmama, you must have had very strong\neyes to see as you do--and so much fine work as you have done too!--I\nonly wish my eyes may last me as well.'”\n\nAll this spoken extremely fast obliged Miss Bates to stop for breath;\nand Emma said something very civil about the excellence of Miss\nFairfax's handwriting.\n\n“You are extremely kind,” replied Miss Bates, highly gratified; “you who\nare such a judge, and write so beautifully yourself. I am sure there is\nnobody's praise that could give us so much pleasure as Miss Woodhouse's.\nMy mother does not hear; she is a little deaf you know. Ma'am,”\n addressing her, “do you hear what Miss Woodhouse is so obliging to say\nabout Jane's handwriting?”\n\nAnd Emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment repeated\ntwice over before the good old lady could comprehend it. She was\npondering, in the meanwhile, upon the possibility, without seeming very\nrude, of making her escape from Jane Fairfax's letter, and had almost\nresolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse, when Miss\nBates turned to her again and seized her attention.\n\n“My mother's deafness is very trifling you see--just nothing at all. By\nonly raising my voice, and saying any thing two or three times over,\nshe is sure to hear; but then she is used to my voice. But it is very\nremarkable that she should always hear Jane better than she does me.\nJane speaks so distinct! However, she will not find her grandmama at all\ndeafer than she was two years ago; which is saying a great deal at my\nmother's time of life--and it really is full two years, you know, since\nshe was here. We never were so long without seeing her before, and as\nI was telling Mrs. Cole, we shall hardly know how to make enough of her\nnow.”\n\n“Are you expecting Miss Fairfax here soon?”\n\n“Oh yes; next week.”\n\n“Indeed!--that must be a very great pleasure.”\n\n“Thank you. You are very kind. Yes, next week. Every body is so\nsurprized; and every body says the same obliging things. I am sure she\nwill be as happy to see her friends at Highbury, as they can be to see\nher. Yes, Friday or Saturday; she cannot say which, because Colonel\nCampbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days. So very\ngood of them to send her the whole way! But they always do, you know. Oh\nyes, Friday or Saturday next. That is what she writes about. That is\nthe reason of her writing out of rule, as we call it; for, in the\ncommon course, we should not have heard from her before next Tuesday or\nWednesday.”\n\n“Yes, so I imagined. I was afraid there could be little chance of my\nhearing any thing of Miss Fairfax to-day.”\n\n“So obliging of you! No, we should not have heard, if it had not been\nfor this particular circumstance, of her being to come here so soon. My\nmother is so delighted!--for she is to be three months with us at\nleast. Three months, she says so, positively, as I am going to have the\npleasure of reading to you. The case is, you see, that the Campbells are\ngoing to Ireland. Mrs. Dixon has persuaded her father and mother to come\nover and see her directly. They had not intended to go over till the\nsummer, but she is so impatient to see them again--for till she married,\nlast October, she was never away from them so much as a week, which must\nmake it very strange to be in different kingdoms, I was going to say,\nbut however different countries, and so she wrote a very urgent letter\nto her mother--or her father, I declare I do not know which it was, but\nwe shall see presently in Jane's letter--wrote in Mr. Dixon's name as\nwell as her own, to press their coming over directly, and they would\ngive them the meeting in Dublin, and take them back to their country\nseat, Baly-craig, a beautiful place, I fancy. Jane has heard a great\ndeal of its beauty; from Mr. Dixon, I mean--I do not know that she ever\nheard about it from any body else; but it was very natural, you know,\nthat he should like to speak of his own place while he was paying his\naddresses--and as Jane used to be very often walking out with them--for\nColonel and Mrs. Campbell were very particular about their daughter's\nnot walking out often with only Mr. Dixon, for which I do not at all\nblame them; of course she heard every thing he might be telling Miss\nCampbell about his own home in Ireland; and I think she wrote us word\nthat he had shewn them some drawings of the place, views that he had\ntaken himself. He is a most amiable, charming young man, I believe. Jane\nwas quite longing to go to Ireland, from his account of things.”\n\nAt this moment, an ingenious and animating suspicion entering Emma's\nbrain with regard to Jane Fairfax, this charming Mr. Dixon, and the\nnot going to Ireland, she said, with the insidious design of farther\ndiscovery,\n\n“You must feel it very fortunate that Miss Fairfax should be allowed to\ncome to you at such a time. Considering the very particular friendship\nbetween her and Mrs. Dixon, you could hardly have expected her to be\nexcused from accompanying Colonel and Mrs. Campbell.”\n\n“Very true, very true, indeed. The very thing that we have always been\nrather afraid of; for we should not have liked to have her at such a\ndistance from us, for months together--not able to come if any thing was\nto happen. But you see, every thing turns out for the best. They want\nher (Mr. and Mrs. Dixon) excessively to come over with Colonel and Mrs.\nCampbell; quite depend upon it; nothing can be more kind or pressing\nthan their _joint_ invitation, Jane says, as you will hear presently;\nMr. Dixon does not seem in the least backward in any attention. He is\na most charming young man. Ever since the service he rendered Jane at\nWeymouth, when they were out in that party on the water, and she, by the\nsudden whirling round of something or other among the sails, would have\nbeen dashed into the sea at once, and actually was all but gone, if he\nhad not, with the greatest presence of mind, caught hold of her habit--\n(I can never think of it without trembling!)--But ever since we had the\nhistory of that day, I have been so fond of Mr. Dixon!”\n\n“But, in spite of all her friends' urgency, and her own wish of seeing\nIreland, Miss Fairfax prefers devoting the time to you and Mrs. Bates?”\n\n“Yes--entirely her own doing, entirely her own choice; and Colonel\nand Mrs. Campbell think she does quite right, just what they should\nrecommend; and indeed they particularly _wish_ her to try her native\nair, as she has not been quite so well as usual lately.”\n\n“I am concerned to hear of it. I think they judge wisely. But Mrs.\nDixon must be very much disappointed. Mrs. Dixon, I understand, has\nno remarkable degree of personal beauty; is not, by any means, to be\ncompared with Miss Fairfax.”\n\n“Oh! no. You are very obliging to say such things--but certainly not.\nThere is no comparison between them. Miss Campbell always was absolutely\nplain--but extremely elegant and amiable.”\n\n“Yes, that of course.”\n\n“Jane caught a bad cold, poor thing! so long ago as the 7th of November,\n(as I am going to read to you,) and has never been well since. A long\ntime, is not it, for a cold to hang upon her? She never mentioned\nit before, because she would not alarm us. Just like her! so\nconsiderate!--But however, she is so far from well, that her kind\nfriends the Campbells think she had better come home, and try an air\nthat always agrees with her; and they have no doubt that three or four\nmonths at Highbury will entirely cure her--and it is certainly a great\ndeal better that she should come here, than go to Ireland, if she is\nunwell. Nobody could nurse her, as we should do.”\n\n“It appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world.”\n\n“And so she is to come to us next Friday or Saturday, and the Campbells\nleave town in their way to Holyhead the Monday following--as you will\nfind from Jane's letter. So sudden!--You may guess, dear Miss Woodhouse,\nwhat a flurry it has thrown me in! If it was not for the drawback of\nher illness--but I am afraid we must expect to see her grown thin, and\nlooking very poorly. I must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to\nme, as to that. I always make a point of reading Jane's letters through\nto myself first, before I read them aloud to my mother, you know, for\nfear of there being any thing in them to distress her. Jane desired me\nto do it, so I always do: and so I began to-day with my usual caution;\nbut no sooner did I come to the mention of her being unwell, than I\nburst out, quite frightened, with 'Bless me! poor Jane is ill!'--which\nmy mother, being on the watch, heard distinctly, and was sadly alarmed\nat. However, when I read on, I found it was not near so bad as I had\nfancied at first; and I make so light of it now to her, that she does\nnot think much about it. But I cannot imagine how I could be so off my\nguard. If Jane does not get well soon, we will call in Mr. Perry. The\nexpense shall not be thought of; and though he is so liberal, and so\nfond of Jane that I dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for\nattendance, we could not suffer it to be so, you know. He has a wife and\nfamily to maintain, and is not to be giving away his time. Well, now I\nhave just given you a hint of what Jane writes about, we will turn to\nher letter, and I am sure she tells her own story a great deal better\nthan I can tell it for her.”\n\n“I am afraid we must be running away,” said Emma, glancing at Harriet,\nand beginning to rise--“My father will be expecting us. I had no\nintention, I thought I had no power of staying more than five minutes,\nwhen I first entered the house. I merely called, because I would not\npass the door without inquiring after Mrs. Bates; but I have been so\npleasantly detained! Now, however, we must wish you and Mrs. Bates good\nmorning.”\n\nAnd not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded. She regained\nthe street--happy in this, that though much had been forced on her\nagainst her will, though she had in fact heard the whole substance of\nJane Fairfax's letter, she had been able to escape the letter itself.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nJane Fairfax was an orphan, the only child of Mrs. Bates's youngest\ndaughter.\n\nThe marriage of Lieut. Fairfax of the ----regiment of infantry,\nand Miss Jane Bates, had had its day of fame and pleasure, hope\nand interest; but nothing now remained of it, save the melancholy\nremembrance of him dying in action abroad--of his widow sinking under\nconsumption and grief soon afterwards--and this girl.\n\nBy birth she belonged to Highbury: and when at three years old, on\nlosing her mother, she became the property, the charge, the consolation,\nthe foundling of her grandmother and aunt, there had seemed every\nprobability of her being permanently fixed there; of her being taught\nonly what very limited means could command, and growing up with no\nadvantages of connexion or improvement, to be engrafted on what\nnature had given her in a pleasing person, good understanding, and\nwarm-hearted, well-meaning relations.\n\nBut the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave a change\nto her destiny. This was Colonel Campbell, who had very highly regarded\nFairfax, as an excellent officer and most deserving young man; and\nfarther, had been indebted to him for such attentions, during a severe\ncamp-fever, as he believed had saved his life. These were claims which\nhe did not learn to overlook, though some years passed away from the\ndeath of poor Fairfax, before his own return to England put any thing in\nhis power. When he did return, he sought out the child and took notice\nof her. He was a married man, with only one living child, a girl, about\nJane's age: and Jane became their guest, paying them long visits and\ngrowing a favourite with all; and before she was nine years old, his\ndaughter's great fondness for her, and his own wish of being a real\nfriend, united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell of undertaking\nthe whole charge of her education. It was accepted; and from that period\nJane had belonged to Colonel Campbell's family, and had lived with them\nentirely, only visiting her grandmother from time to time.\n\nThe plan was that she should be brought up for educating others; the\nvery few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father making\nindependence impossible. To provide for her otherwise was out of Colonel\nCampbell's power; for though his income, by pay and appointments, was\nhandsome, his fortune was moderate and must be all his daughter's;\nbut, by giving her an education, he hoped to be supplying the means of\nrespectable subsistence hereafter.\n\nSuch was Jane Fairfax's history. She had fallen into good hands, known\nnothing but kindness from the Campbells, and been given an excellent\neducation. Living constantly with right-minded and well-informed people,\nher heart and understanding had received every advantage of discipline\nand culture; and Colonel Campbell's residence being in London, every\nlighter talent had been done full justice to, by the attendance of\nfirst-rate masters. Her disposition and abilities were equally worthy\nof all that friendship could do; and at eighteen or nineteen she was,\nas far as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children,\nfully competent to the office of instruction herself; but she was too\nmuch beloved to be parted with. Neither father nor mother could promote,\nand the daughter could not endure it. The evil day was put off. It was\neasy to decide that she was still too young; and Jane remained with\nthem, sharing, as another daughter, in all the rational pleasures of\nan elegant society, and a judicious mixture of home and amusement, with\nonly the drawback of the future, the sobering suggestions of her own\ngood understanding to remind her that all this might soon be over.\n\nThe affection of the whole family, the warm attachment of Miss\nCampbell in particular, was the more honourable to each party from\nthe circumstance of Jane's decided superiority both in beauty and\nacquirements. That nature had given it in feature could not be unseen\nby the young woman, nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by the\nparents. They continued together with unabated regard however, till the\nmarriage of Miss Campbell, who by that chance, that luck which so often\ndefies anticipation in matrimonial affairs, giving attraction to what is\nmoderate rather than to what is superior, engaged the affections of\nMr. Dixon, a young man, rich and agreeable, almost as soon as they were\nacquainted; and was eligibly and happily settled, while Jane Fairfax had\nyet her bread to earn.\n\nThis event had very lately taken place; too lately for any thing to be\nyet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path\nof duty; though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had\nfixed on for beginning. She had long resolved that one-and-twenty\nshould be the period. With the fortitude of a devoted novitiate, she had\nresolved at one-and-twenty to complete the sacrifice, and retire from\nall the pleasures of life, of rational intercourse, equal society, peace\nand hope, to penance and mortification for ever.\n\nThe good sense of Colonel and Mrs. Campbell could not oppose such\na resolution, though their feelings did. As long as they lived, no\nexertions would be necessary, their home might be hers for ever; and for\ntheir own comfort they would have retained her wholly; but this would\nbe selfishness:--what must be at last, had better be soon. Perhaps they\nbegan to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have resisted the\ntemptation of any delay, and spared her from a taste of such enjoyments\nof ease and leisure as must now be relinquished. Still, however,\naffection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying\non the wretched moment. She had never been quite well since the time of\ntheir daughter's marriage; and till she should have completely recovered\nher usual strength, they must forbid her engaging in duties, which, so\nfar from being compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits,\nseemed, under the most favourable circumstances, to require something\nmore than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with\ntolerable comfort.\n\nWith regard to her not accompanying them to Ireland, her account to her\naunt contained nothing but truth, though there might be some truths\nnot told. It was her own choice to give the time of their absence to\nHighbury; to spend, perhaps, her last months of perfect liberty with\nthose kind relations to whom she was so very dear: and the Campbells,\nwhatever might be their motive or motives, whether single, or double, or\ntreble, gave the arrangement their ready sanction, and said, that they\ndepended more on a few months spent in her native air, for the recovery\nof her health, than on any thing else. Certain it was that she was to\ncome; and that Highbury, instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which\nhad been so long promised it--Mr. Frank Churchill--must put up for the\npresent with Jane Fairfax, who could bring only the freshness of a two\nyears' absence.\n\nEmma was sorry;--to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like\nthrough three long months!--to be always doing more than she wished,\nand less than she ought! Why she did not like Jane Fairfax might be a\ndifficult question to answer; Mr. Knightley had once told her it was\nbecause she saw in her the really accomplished young woman, which she\nwanted to be thought herself; and though the accusation had been eagerly\nrefuted at the time, there were moments of self-examination in which\nher conscience could not quite acquit her. But “she could never get\nacquainted with her: she did not know how it was, but there was such\ncoldness and reserve--such apparent indifference whether she pleased or\nnot--and then, her aunt was such an eternal talker!--and she was made\nsuch a fuss with by every body!--and it had been always imagined that\nthey were to be so intimate--because their ages were the same, every\nbody had supposed they must be so fond of each other.” These were her\nreasons--she had no better.\n\nIt was a dislike so little just--every imputed fault was so magnified\nby fancy, that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any\nconsiderable absence, without feeling that she had injured her; and\nnow, when the due visit was paid, on her arrival, after a two years'\ninterval, she was particularly struck with the very appearance and\nmanners, which for those two whole years she had been depreciating. Jane\nFairfax was very elegant, remarkably elegant; and she had herself the\nhighest value for elegance. Her height was pretty, just such as almost\nevery body would think tall, and nobody could think very tall; her\nfigure particularly graceful; her size a most becoming medium, between\nfat and thin, though a slight appearance of ill-health seemed to point\nout the likeliest evil of the two. Emma could not but feel all this; and\nthen, her face--her features--there was more beauty in them altogether\nthan she had remembered; it was not regular, but it was very pleasing\nbeauty. Her eyes, a deep grey, with dark eye-lashes and eyebrows, had\nnever been denied their praise; but the skin, which she had been used to\ncavil at, as wanting colour, had a clearness and delicacy which really\nneeded no fuller bloom. It was a style of beauty, of which elegance was\nthe reigning character, and as such, she must, in honour, by all her\nprinciples, admire it:--elegance, which, whether of person or of mind,\nshe saw so little in Highbury. There, not to be vulgar, was distinction,\nand merit.\n\nIn short, she sat, during the first visit, looking at Jane Fairfax with\ntwofold complacency; the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering\njustice, and was determining that she would dislike her no longer. When\nshe took in her history, indeed, her situation, as well as her beauty;\nwhen she considered what all this elegance was destined to, what she was\ngoing to sink from, how she was going to live, it seemed impossible\nto feel any thing but compassion and respect; especially, if to every\nwell-known particular entitling her to interest, were added the highly\nprobable circumstance of an attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she had\nso naturally started to herself. In that case, nothing could be more\npitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on.\nEmma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced Mr. Dixon's\nactions from his wife, or of any thing mischievous which her imagination\nhad suggested at first. If it were love, it might be simple, single,\nsuccessless love on her side alone. She might have been unconsciously\nsucking in the sad poison, while a sharer of his conversation with her\nfriend; and from the best, the purest of motives, might now be\ndenying herself this visit to Ireland, and resolving to divide herself\neffectually from him and his connexions by soon beginning her career of\nlaborious duty.\n\nUpon the whole, Emma left her with such softened, charitable feelings,\nas made her look around in walking home, and lament that Highbury\nafforded no young man worthy of giving her independence; nobody that she\ncould wish to scheme about for her.\n\nThese were charming feelings--but not lasting. Before she had committed\nherself by any public profession of eternal friendship for Jane Fairfax,\nor done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and errors, than\nsaying to Mr. Knightley, “She certainly is handsome; she is better than\nhandsome!” Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield with her grandmother\nand aunt, and every thing was relapsing much into its usual state.\nFormer provocations reappeared. The aunt was as tiresome as ever; more\ntiresome, because anxiety for her health was now added to admiration\nof her powers; and they had to listen to the description of exactly how\nlittle bread and butter she ate for breakfast, and how small a slice\nof mutton for dinner, as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new\nworkbags for her mother and herself; and Jane's offences rose again.\nThey had music; Emma was obliged to play; and the thanks and praise\nwhich necessarily followed appeared to her an affectation of candour, an\nair of greatness, meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very\nsuperior performance. She was, besides, which was the worst of all, so\ncold, so cautious! There was no getting at her real opinion. Wrapt up in\na cloak of politeness, she seemed determined to hazard nothing. She was\ndisgustingly, was suspiciously reserved.\n\nIf any thing could be more, where all was most, she was more reserved on\nthe subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing. She seemed bent\non giving no real insight into Mr. Dixon's character, or her own value\nfor his company, or opinion of the suitableness of the match. It was all\ngeneral approbation and smoothness; nothing delineated or distinguished.\nIt did her no service however. Her caution was thrown away. Emma saw\nits artifice, and returned to her first surmises. There probably _was_\nsomething more to conceal than her own preference; Mr. Dixon, perhaps,\nhad been very near changing one friend for the other, or been fixed only\nto Miss Campbell, for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds.\n\nThe like reserve prevailed on other topics. She and Mr. Frank Churchill\nhad been at Weymouth at the same time. It was known that they were a\nlittle acquainted; but not a syllable of real information could Emma\nprocure as to what he truly was. “Was he handsome?”--“She believed\nhe was reckoned a very fine young man.” “Was he agreeable?”--“He was\ngenerally thought so.” “Did he appear a sensible young man; a young\nman of information?”--“At a watering-place, or in a common London\nacquaintance, it was difficult to decide on such points. Manners were\nall that could be safely judged of, under a much longer knowledge than\nthey had yet had of Mr. Churchill. She believed every body found his\nmanners pleasing.” Emma could not forgive her.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nEmma could not forgive her;--but as neither provocation nor resentment\nwere discerned by Mr. Knightley, who had been of the party, and had\nseen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side, he was\nexpressing the next morning, being at Hartfield again on business with\nMr. Woodhouse, his approbation of the whole; not so openly as he might\nhave done had her father been out of the room, but speaking plain enough\nto be very intelligible to Emma. He had been used to think her unjust to\nJane, and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement.\n\n“A very pleasant evening,” he began, as soon as Mr. Woodhouse had been\ntalked into what was necessary, told that he understood, and the papers\nswept away;--“particularly pleasant. You and Miss Fairfax gave us some\nvery good music. I do not know a more luxurious state, sir, than sitting\nat one's ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such young women;\nsometimes with music and sometimes with conversation. I am sure Miss\nFairfax must have found the evening pleasant, Emma. You left nothing\nundone. I was glad you made her play so much, for having no instrument\nat her grandmother's, it must have been a real indulgence.”\n\n“I am happy you approved,” said Emma, smiling; “but I hope I am not\noften deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield.”\n\n“No, my dear,” said her father instantly; “_that_ I am sure you are not.\nThere is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are. If any thing,\nyou are too attentive. The muffin last night--if it had been handed\nround once, I think it would have been enough.”\n\n“No,” said Mr. Knightley, nearly at the same time; “you are not often\ndeficient; not often deficient either in manner or comprehension. I\nthink you understand me, therefore.”\n\nAn arch look expressed--“I understand you well enough;” but she said\nonly, “Miss Fairfax is reserved.”\n\n“I always told you she was--a little; but you will soon overcome all\nthat part of her reserve which ought to be overcome, all that has its\nfoundation in diffidence. What arises from discretion must be honoured.”\n\n“You think her diffident. I do not see it.”\n\n“My dear Emma,” said he, moving from his chair into one close by her,\n“you are not going to tell me, I hope, that you had not a pleasant\nevening.”\n\n“Oh! no; I was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions; and\namused to think how little information I obtained.”\n\n“I am disappointed,” was his only answer.\n\n“I hope every body had a pleasant evening,” said Mr. Woodhouse, in his\nquiet way. “I had. Once, I felt the fire rather too much; but then I\nmoved back my chair a little, a very little, and it did not disturb me.\nMiss Bates was very chatty and good-humoured, as she always is, though\nshe speaks rather too quick. However, she is very agreeable, and Mrs.\nBates too, in a different way. I like old friends; and Miss Jane\nFairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady, a very pretty and a\nvery well-behaved young lady indeed. She must have found the evening\nagreeable, Mr. Knightley, because she had Emma.”\n\n“True, sir; and Emma, because she had Miss Fairfax.”\n\nEmma saw his anxiety, and wishing to appease it, at least for the\npresent, said, and with a sincerity which no one could question--\n\n“She is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one's eyes from.\nI am always watching her to admire; and I do pity her from my heart.”\n\nMr. Knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared to\nexpress; and before he could make any reply, Mr. Woodhouse, whose\nthoughts were on the Bates's, said--\n\n“It is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined! a\ngreat pity indeed! and I have often wished--but it is so little one can\nventure to do--small, trifling presents, of any thing uncommon--Now we\nhave killed a porker, and Emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg;\nit is very small and delicate--Hartfield pork is not like any other\npork--but still it is pork--and, my dear Emma, unless one could be sure\nof their making it into steaks, nicely fried, as ours are fried, without\nthe smallest grease, and not roast it, for no stomach can bear roast\npork--I think we had better send the leg--do not you think so, my dear?”\n\n“My dear papa, I sent the whole hind-quarter. I knew you would wish it.\nThere will be the leg to be salted, you know, which is so very nice, and\nthe loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like.”\n\n“That's right, my dear, very right. I had not thought of it before, but\nthat is the best way. They must not over-salt the leg; and then, if it\nis not over-salted, and if it is very thoroughly boiled, just as Serle\nboils ours, and eaten very moderately of, with a boiled turnip, and a\nlittle carrot or parsnip, I do not consider it unwholesome.”\n\n“Emma,” said Mr. Knightley presently, “I have a piece of news for you.\nYou like news--and I heard an article in my way hither that I think will\ninterest you.”\n\n“News! Oh! yes, I always like news. What is it?--why do you smile\nso?--where did you hear it?--at Randalls?”\n\nHe had time only to say,\n\n“No, not at Randalls; I have not been near Randalls,” when the door was\nthrown open, and Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax walked into the room. Full\nof thanks, and full of news, Miss Bates knew not which to give quickest.\nMr. Knightley soon saw that he had lost his moment, and that not another\nsyllable of communication could rest with him.\n\n“Oh! my dear sir, how are you this morning? My dear Miss Woodhouse--I\ncome quite over-powered. Such a beautiful hind-quarter of pork! You\nare too bountiful! Have you heard the news? Mr. Elton is going to be\nmarried.”\n\nEmma had not had time even to think of Mr. Elton, and she was so\ncompletely surprized that she could not avoid a little start, and a\nlittle blush, at the sound.\n\n“There is my news:--I thought it would interest you,” said Mr.\nKnightley, with a smile which implied a conviction of some part of what\nhad passed between them.\n\n“But where could _you_ hear it?” cried Miss Bates. “Where could you\npossibly hear it, Mr. Knightley? For it is not five minutes since I\nreceived Mrs. Cole's note--no, it cannot be more than five--or at least\nten--for I had got my bonnet and spencer on, just ready to come out--I\nwas only gone down to speak to Patty again about the pork--Jane was\nstanding in the passage--were not you, Jane?--for my mother was so\nafraid that we had not any salting-pan large enough. So I said I would\ngo down and see, and Jane said, 'Shall I go down instead? for I think\nyou have a little cold, and Patty has been washing the kitchen.'--'Oh!\nmy dear,' said I--well, and just then came the note. A Miss\nHawkins--that's all I know. A Miss Hawkins of Bath. But, Mr. Knightley,\nhow could you possibly have heard it? for the very moment Mr. Cole told\nMrs. Cole of it, she sat down and wrote to me. A Miss Hawkins--”\n\n“I was with Mr. Cole on business an hour and a half ago. He had just\nread Elton's letter as I was shewn in, and handed it to me directly.”\n\n“Well! that is quite--I suppose there never was a piece of news more\ngenerally interesting. My dear sir, you really are too bountiful. My\nmother desires her very best compliments and regards, and a thousand\nthanks, and says you really quite oppress her.”\n\n“We consider our Hartfield pork,” replied Mr. Woodhouse--“indeed it\ncertainly is, so very superior to all other pork, that Emma and I cannot\nhave a greater pleasure than--”\n\n“Oh! my dear sir, as my mother says, our friends are only too good\nto us. If ever there were people who, without having great wealth\nthemselves, had every thing they could wish for, I am sure it is us.\nWe may well say that 'our lot is cast in a goodly heritage.' Well, Mr.\nKnightley, and so you actually saw the letter; well--”\n\n“It was short--merely to announce--but cheerful, exulting, of course.”--\nHere was a sly glance at Emma. “He had been so fortunate as to--I forget\nthe precise words--one has no business to remember them. The information\nwas, as you state, that he was going to be married to a Miss Hawkins. By\nhis style, I should imagine it just settled.”\n\n“Mr. Elton going to be married!” said Emma, as soon as she could speak.\n“He will have every body's wishes for his happiness.”\n\n“He is very young to settle,” was Mr. Woodhouse's observation. “He had\nbetter not be in a hurry. He seemed to me very well off as he was. We\nwere always glad to see him at Hartfield.”\n\n“A new neighbour for us all, Miss Woodhouse!” said Miss Bates, joyfully;\n“my mother is so pleased!--she says she cannot bear to have the poor old\nVicarage without a mistress. This is great news, indeed. Jane, you have\nnever seen Mr. Elton!--no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see\nhim.”\n\nJane's curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly to\noccupy her.\n\n“No--I have never seen Mr. Elton,” she replied, starting on this appeal;\n“is he--is he a tall man?”\n\n“Who shall answer that question?” cried Emma. “My father would say\n'yes,' Mr. Knightley 'no;' and Miss Bates and I that he is just the\nhappy medium. When you have been here a little longer, Miss Fairfax,\nyou will understand that Mr. Elton is the standard of perfection in\nHighbury, both in person and mind.”\n\n“Very true, Miss Woodhouse, so she will. He is the very best young\nman--But, my dear Jane, if you remember, I told you yesterday he\nwas precisely the height of Mr. Perry. Miss Hawkins,--I dare say, an\nexcellent young woman. His extreme attention to my mother--wanting\nher to sit in the vicarage pew, that she might hear the better, for my\nmother is a little deaf, you know--it is not much, but she does not\nhear quite quick. Jane says that Colonel Campbell is a little deaf. He\nfancied bathing might be good for it--the warm bath--but she says it did\nhim no lasting benefit. Colonel Campbell, you know, is quite our angel.\nAnd Mr. Dixon seems a very charming young man, quite worthy of him. It\nis such a happiness when good people get together--and they always do.\nNow, here will be Mr. Elton and Miss Hawkins; and there are the Coles,\nsuch very good people; and the Perrys--I suppose there never was a\nhappier or a better couple than Mr. and Mrs. Perry. I say, sir,” turning\nto Mr. Woodhouse, “I think there are few places with such society as\nHighbury. I always say, we are quite blessed in our neighbours.--My dear\nsir, if there is one thing my mother loves better than another, it is\npork--a roast loin of pork--”\n\n“As to who, or what Miss Hawkins is, or how long he has been acquainted\nwith her,” said Emma, “nothing I suppose can be known. One feels that it\ncannot be a very long acquaintance. He has been gone only four weeks.”\n\nNobody had any information to give; and, after a few more wonderings,\nEmma said,\n\n“You are silent, Miss Fairfax--but I hope you mean to take an interest\nin this news. You, who have been hearing and seeing so much of late\non these subjects, who must have been so deep in the business on Miss\nCampbell's account--we shall not excuse your being indifferent about Mr.\nElton and Miss Hawkins.”\n\n“When I have seen Mr. Elton,” replied Jane, “I dare say I shall be\ninterested--but I believe it requires _that_ with me. And as it is some\nmonths since Miss Campbell married, the impression may be a little worn\noff.”\n\n“Yes, he has been gone just four weeks, as you observe, Miss Woodhouse,”\n said Miss Bates, “four weeks yesterday.--A Miss Hawkins!--Well, I had\nalways rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts; not that\nI ever--Mrs. Cole once whispered to me--but I immediately said, 'No, Mr.\nElton is a most worthy young man--but'--In short, I do not think I am\nparticularly quick at those sort of discoveries. I do not pretend to it.\nWhat is before me, I see. At the same time, nobody could wonder if\nMr. Elton should have aspired--Miss Woodhouse lets me chatter on, so\ngood-humouredly. She knows I would not offend for the world. How does\nMiss Smith do? She seems quite recovered now. Have you heard from Mrs.\nJohn Knightley lately? Oh! those dear little children. Jane, do you\nknow I always fancy Mr. Dixon like Mr. John Knightley. I mean in\nperson--tall, and with that sort of look--and not very talkative.”\n\n“Quite wrong, my dear aunt; there is no likeness at all.”\n\n“Very odd! but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand.\nOne takes up a notion, and runs away with it. Mr. Dixon, you say, is\nnot, strictly speaking, handsome?”\n\n“Handsome! Oh! no--far from it--certainly plain. I told you he was\nplain.”\n\n“My dear, you said that Miss Campbell would not allow him to be plain,\nand that you yourself--”\n\n“Oh! as for me, my judgment is worth nothing. Where I have a regard,\nI always think a person well-looking. But I gave what I believed the\ngeneral opinion, when I called him plain.”\n\n“Well, my dear Jane, I believe we must be running away. The weather does\nnot look well, and grandmama will be uneasy. You are too obliging, my\ndear Miss Woodhouse; but we really must take leave. This has been a most\nagreeable piece of news indeed. I shall just go round by Mrs. Cole's;\nbut I shall not stop three minutes: and, Jane, you had better go home\ndirectly--I would not have you out in a shower!--We think she is the\nbetter for Highbury already. Thank you, we do indeed. I shall not\nattempt calling on Mrs. Goddard, for I really do not think she cares for\nany thing but _boiled_ pork: when we dress the leg it will be another\nthing. Good morning to you, my dear sir. Oh! Mr. Knightley is coming\ntoo. Well, that is so very!--I am sure if Jane is tired, you will be\nso kind as to give her your arm.--Mr. Elton, and Miss Hawkins!--Good\nmorning to you.”\n\nEmma, alone with her father, had half her attention wanted by him while\nhe lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry--and to\nmarry strangers too--and the other half she could give to her own view\nof the subject. It was to herself an amusing and a very welcome piece\nof news, as proving that Mr. Elton could not have suffered long; but she\nwas sorry for Harriet: Harriet must feel it--and all that she could hope\nwas, by giving the first information herself, to save her from hearing\nit abruptly from others. It was now about the time that she was likely\nto call. If she were to meet Miss Bates in her way!--and upon its\nbeginning to rain, Emma was obliged to expect that the weather would\nbe detaining her at Mrs. Goddard's, and that the intelligence would\nundoubtedly rush upon her without preparation.\n\nThe shower was heavy, but short; and it had not been over five minutes,\nwhen in came Harriet, with just the heated, agitated look which\nhurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give; and the “Oh! Miss\nWoodhouse, what do you think has happened!” which instantly burst forth,\nhad all the evidence of corresponding perturbation. As the blow was\ngiven, Emma felt that she could not now shew greater kindness than in\nlistening; and Harriet, unchecked, ran eagerly through what she had to\ntell. “She had set out from Mrs. Goddard's half an hour ago--she had\nbeen afraid it would rain--she had been afraid it would pour down\nevery moment--but she thought she might get to Hartfield first--she\nhad hurried on as fast as possible; but then, as she was passing by the\nhouse where a young woman was making up a gown for her, she thought she\nwould just step in and see how it went on; and though she did not seem\nto stay half a moment there, soon after she came out it began to rain,\nand she did not know what to do; so she ran on directly, as fast as\nshe could, and took shelter at Ford's.”--Ford's was the principal\nwoollen-draper, linen-draper, and haberdasher's shop united; the shop\nfirst in size and fashion in the place.--“And so, there she had\nset, without an idea of any thing in the world, full ten minutes,\nperhaps--when, all of a sudden, who should come in--to be sure it was\nso very odd!--but they always dealt at Ford's--who should come in, but\nElizabeth Martin and her brother!--Dear Miss Woodhouse! only think. I\nthought I should have fainted. I did not know what to do. I was sitting\nnear the door--Elizabeth saw me directly; but he did not; he was busy\nwith the umbrella. I am sure she saw me, but she looked away directly,\nand took no notice; and they both went to quite the farther end of the\nshop; and I kept sitting near the door!--Oh! dear; I was so miserable!\nI am sure I must have been as white as my gown. I could not go away\nyou know, because of the rain; but I did so wish myself anywhere in the\nworld but there.--Oh! dear, Miss Woodhouse--well, at last, I fancy, he\nlooked round and saw me; for instead of going on with her buyings, they\nbegan whispering to one another. I am sure they were talking of me; and\nI could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to me--(do\nyou think he was, Miss Woodhouse?)--for presently she came forward--came\nquite up to me, and asked me how I did, and seemed ready to shake hands,\nif I would. She did not do any of it in the same way that she used; I\ncould see she was altered; but, however, she seemed to _try_ to be very\nfriendly, and we shook hands, and stood talking some time; but I know no\nmore what I said--I was in such a tremble!--I remember she said she\nwas sorry we never met now; which I thought almost too kind! Dear, Miss\nWoodhouse, I was absolutely miserable! By that time, it was beginning to\nhold up, and I was determined that nothing should stop me from getting\naway--and then--only think!--I found he was coming up towards me\ntoo--slowly you know, and as if he did not quite know what to do; and\nso he came and spoke, and I answered--and I stood for a minute, feeling\ndreadfully, you know, one can't tell how; and then I took courage, and\nsaid it did not rain, and I must go; and so off I set; and I had not got\nthree yards from the door, when he came after me, only to say, if I was\ngoing to Hartfield, he thought I had much better go round by Mr. Cole's\nstables, for I should find the near way quite floated by this rain. Oh!\ndear, I thought it would have been the death of me! So I said, I was\nvery much obliged to him: you know I could not do less; and then he went\nback to Elizabeth, and I came round by the stables--I believe I did--but\nI hardly knew where I was, or any thing about it. Oh! Miss Woodhouse,\nI would rather done any thing than have it happen: and yet, you know,\nthere was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and\nso kindly. And Elizabeth, too. Oh! Miss Woodhouse, do talk to me and\nmake me comfortable again.”\n\nVery sincerely did Emma wish to do so; but it was not immediately in\nher power. She was obliged to stop and think. She was not thoroughly\ncomfortable herself. The young man's conduct, and his sister's, seemed\nthe result of real feeling, and she could not but pity them. As Harriet\ndescribed it, there had been an interesting mixture of wounded affection\nand genuine delicacy in their behaviour. But she had believed them to be\nwell-meaning, worthy people before; and what difference did this make\nin the evils of the connexion? It was folly to be disturbed by it. Of\ncourse, he must be sorry to lose her--they must be all sorry. Ambition,\nas well as love, had probably been mortified. They might all have hoped\nto rise by Harriet's acquaintance: and besides, what was the value of\nHarriet's description?--So easily pleased--so little discerning;--what\nsignified her praise?\n\nShe exerted herself, and did try to make her comfortable, by considering\nall that had passed as a mere trifle, and quite unworthy of being dwelt\non,\n\n“It might be distressing, for the moment,” said she; “but you seem to\nhave behaved extremely well; and it is over--and may never--can never,\nas a first meeting, occur again, and therefore you need not think about\nit.”\n\nHarriet said, “very true,” and she “would not think about it;” but still\nshe talked of it--still she could talk of nothing else; and Emma, at\nlast, in order to put the Martins out of her head, was obliged to hurry\non the news, which she had meant to give with so much tender caution;\nhardly knowing herself whether to rejoice or be angry, ashamed or only\namused, at such a state of mind in poor Harriet--such a conclusion of\nMr. Elton's importance with her!\n\nMr. Elton's rights, however, gradually revived. Though she did not feel\nthe first intelligence as she might have done the day before, or an hour\nbefore, its interest soon increased; and before their first conversation\nwas over, she had talked herself into all the sensations of curiosity,\nwonder and regret, pain and pleasure, as to this fortunate Miss Hawkins,\nwhich could conduce to place the Martins under proper subordination in\nher fancy.\n\nEmma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting. It\nhad been serviceable in deadening the first shock, without retaining any\ninfluence to alarm. As Harriet now lived, the Martins could not get\nat her, without seeking her, where hitherto they had wanted either the\ncourage or the condescension to seek her; for since her refusal of the\nbrother, the sisters never had been at Mrs. Goddard's; and a twelvemonth\nmight pass without their being thrown together again, with any\nnecessity, or even any power of speech.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nHuman nature is so well disposed towards those who are in interesting\nsituations, that a young person, who either marries or dies, is sure of\nbeing kindly spoken of.\n\nA week had not passed since Miss Hawkins's name was first mentioned in\nHighbury, before she was, by some means or other, discovered to have\nevery recommendation of person and mind; to be handsome, elegant, highly\naccomplished, and perfectly amiable: and when Mr. Elton himself arrived\nto triumph in his happy prospects, and circulate the fame of her merits,\nthere was very little more for him to do, than to tell her Christian\nname, and say whose music she principally played.\n\nMr. Elton returned, a very happy man. He had gone away rejected and\nmortified--disappointed in a very sanguine hope, after a series of what\nappeared to him strong encouragement; and not only losing the right\nlady, but finding himself debased to the level of a very wrong one. He\nhad gone away deeply offended--he came back engaged to another--and\nto another as superior, of course, to the first, as under such\ncircumstances what is gained always is to what is lost. He came back gay\nand self-satisfied, eager and busy, caring nothing for Miss Woodhouse,\nand defying Miss Smith.\n\nThe charming Augusta Hawkins, in addition to all the usual advantages of\nperfect beauty and merit, was in possession of an independent fortune,\nof so many thousands as would always be called ten; a point of some\ndignity, as well as some convenience: the story told well; he had not\nthrown himself away--he had gained a woman of 10,000 l. or thereabouts;\nand he had gained her with such delightful rapidity--the first hour of\nintroduction had been so very soon followed by distinguishing notice;\nthe history which he had to give Mrs. Cole of the rise and progress\nof the affair was so glorious--the steps so quick, from the accidental\nrencontre, to the dinner at Mr. Green's, and the party at Mrs.\nBrown's--smiles and blushes rising in importance--with consciousness and\nagitation richly scattered--the lady had been so easily impressed--so\nsweetly disposed--had in short, to use a most intelligible phrase,\nbeen so very ready to have him, that vanity and prudence were equally\ncontented.\n\nHe had caught both substance and shadow--both fortune and affection, and\nwas just the happy man he ought to be; talking only of himself and\nhis own concerns--expecting to be congratulated--ready to be laughed\nat--and, with cordial, fearless smiles, now addressing all the young\nladies of the place, to whom, a few weeks ago, he would have been more\ncautiously gallant.\n\nThe wedding was no distant event, as the parties had only themselves to\nplease, and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for; and\nwhen he set out for Bath again, there was a general expectation, which\na certain glance of Mrs. Cole's did not seem to contradict, that when he\nnext entered Highbury he would bring his bride.\n\nDuring his present short stay, Emma had barely seen him; but just enough\nto feel that the first meeting was over, and to give her the impression\nof his not being improved by the mixture of pique and pretension, now\nspread over his air. She was, in fact, beginning very much to wonder\nthat she had ever thought him pleasing at all; and his sight was so\ninseparably connected with some very disagreeable feelings, that,\nexcept in a moral light, as a penance, a lesson, a source of profitable\nhumiliation to her own mind, she would have been thankful to be assured\nof never seeing him again. She wished him very well; but he gave\nher pain, and his welfare twenty miles off would administer most\nsatisfaction.\n\nThe pain of his continued residence in Highbury, however, must\ncertainly be lessened by his marriage. Many vain solicitudes would be\nprevented--many awkwardnesses smoothed by it. A _Mrs._ _Elton_ would\nbe an excuse for any change of intercourse; former intimacy might sink\nwithout remark. It would be almost beginning their life of civility\nagain.\n\nOf the lady, individually, Emma thought very little. She was good enough\nfor Mr. Elton, no doubt; accomplished enough for Highbury--handsome\nenough--to look plain, probably, by Harriet's side. As to connexion,\nthere Emma was perfectly easy; persuaded, that after all his own vaunted\nclaims and disdain of Harriet, he had done nothing. On that article,\ntruth seemed attainable. _What_ she was, must be uncertain; but _who_\nshe was, might be found out; and setting aside the 10,000 l., it did not\nappear that she was at all Harriet's superior. She brought no name, no\nblood, no alliance. Miss Hawkins was the youngest of the two daughters\nof a Bristol--merchant, of course, he must be called; but, as the whole\nof the profits of his mercantile life appeared so very moderate, it\nwas not unfair to guess the dignity of his line of trade had been very\nmoderate also. Part of every winter she had been used to spend in Bath;\nbut Bristol was her home, the very heart of Bristol; for though the\nfather and mother had died some years ago, an uncle remained--in the law\nline--nothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded of him, than\nthat he was in the law line; and with him the daughter had lived. Emma\nguessed him to be the drudge of some attorney, and too stupid to rise.\nAnd all the grandeur of the connexion seemed dependent on the elder\nsister, who was _very_ _well_ _married_, to a gentleman in a _great_\n_way_, near Bristol, who kept two carriages! That was the wind-up of the\nhistory; that was the glory of Miss Hawkins.\n\nCould she but have given Harriet her feelings about it all! She had\ntalked her into love; but, alas! she was not so easily to be talked out\nof it. The charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of Harriet's\nmind was not to be talked away. He might be superseded by another; he\ncertainly would indeed; nothing could be clearer; even a Robert Martin\nwould have been sufficient; but nothing else, she feared, would cure\nher. Harriet was one of those, who, having once begun, would be always\nin love. And now, poor girl! she was considerably worse from this\nreappearance of Mr. Elton. She was always having a glimpse of him\nsomewhere or other. Emma saw him only once; but two or three times every\nday Harriet was sure _just_ to meet with him, or _just_ to miss him,\n_just_ to hear his voice, or see his shoulder, _just_ to have something\noccur to preserve him in her fancy, in all the favouring warmth of\nsurprize and conjecture. She was, moreover, perpetually hearing about\nhim; for, excepting when at Hartfield, she was always among those who\nsaw no fault in Mr. Elton, and found nothing so interesting as\nthe discussion of his concerns; and every report, therefore, every\nguess--all that had already occurred, all that might occur in the\narrangement of his affairs, comprehending income, servants, and\nfurniture, was continually in agitation around her. Her regard was\nreceiving strength by invariable praise of him, and her regrets kept\nalive, and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of Miss\nHawkins's happiness, and continual observation of, how much he seemed\nattached!--his air as he walked by the house--the very sitting of his\nhat, being all in proof of how much he was in love!\n\nHad it been allowable entertainment, had there been no pain to her\nfriend, or reproach to herself, in the waverings of Harriet's mind,\nEmma would have been amused by its variations. Sometimes Mr. Elton\npredominated, sometimes the Martins; and each was occasionally useful\nas a check to the other. Mr. Elton's engagement had been the cure of\nthe agitation of meeting Mr. Martin. The unhappiness produced by the\nknowledge of that engagement had been a little put aside by Elizabeth\nMartin's calling at Mrs. Goddard's a few days afterwards. Harriet had\nnot been at home; but a note had been prepared and left for her, written\nin the very style to touch; a small mixture of reproach, with a great\ndeal of kindness; and till Mr. Elton himself appeared, she had been much\noccupied by it, continually pondering over what could be done in return,\nand wishing to do more than she dared to confess. But Mr. Elton, in\nperson, had driven away all such cares. While he staid, the Martins were\nforgotten; and on the very morning of his setting off for Bath again,\nEmma, to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned, judged it best\nfor her to return Elizabeth Martin's visit.\n\nHow that visit was to be acknowledged--what would be necessary--and\nwhat might be safest, had been a point of some doubtful consideration.\nAbsolute neglect of the mother and sisters, when invited to come, would\nbe ingratitude. It must not be: and yet the danger of a renewal of the\nacquaintance--!\n\nAfter much thinking, she could determine on nothing better, than\nHarriet's returning the visit; but in a way that, if they had\nunderstanding, should convince them that it was to be only a formal\nacquaintance. She meant to take her in the carriage, leave her at the\nAbbey Mill, while she drove a little farther, and call for her again\nso soon, as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous\nrecurrences to the past, and give the most decided proof of what degree\nof intimacy was chosen for the future.\n\nShe could think of nothing better: and though there was something in it\nwhich her own heart could not approve--something of ingratitude, merely\nglossed over--it must be done, or what would become of Harriet?\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nSmall heart had Harriet for visiting. Only half an hour before her\nfriend called for her at Mrs. Goddard's, her evil stars had led her\nto the very spot where, at that moment, a trunk, directed to _The Rev.\nPhilip Elton, White-Hart, Bath_, was to be seen under the operation of\nbeing lifted into the butcher's cart, which was to convey it to where\nthe coaches past; and every thing in this world, excepting that trunk\nand the direction, was consequently a blank.\n\nShe went, however; and when they reached the farm, and she was to be\nput down, at the end of the broad, neat gravel walk, which led between\nespalier apple-trees to the front door, the sight of every thing which\nhad given her so much pleasure the autumn before, was beginning to\nrevive a little local agitation; and when they parted, Emma observed her\nto be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity, which determined\nher not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of an hour.\nShe went on herself, to give that portion of time to an old servant who\nwas married, and settled in Donwell.\n\nThe quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again;\nand Miss Smith receiving her summons, was with her without delay, and\nunattended by any alarming young man. She came solitarily down the\ngravel walk--a Miss Martin just appearing at the door, and parting with\nher seemingly with ceremonious civility.\n\nHarriet could not very soon give an intelligible account. She was\nfeeling too much; but at last Emma collected from her enough to\nunderstand the sort of meeting, and the sort of pain it was creating.\nShe had seen only Mrs. Martin and the two girls. They had received her\ndoubtingly, if not coolly; and nothing beyond the merest commonplace had\nbeen talked almost all the time--till just at last, when Mrs. Martin's\nsaying, all of a sudden, that she thought Miss Smith was grown, had\nbrought on a more interesting subject, and a warmer manner. In that very\nroom she had been measured last September, with her two friends. There\nwere the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot by the window.\n_He_ had done it. They all seemed to remember the day, the hour,\nthe party, the occasion--to feel the same consciousness, the same\nregrets--to be ready to return to the same good understanding; and they\nwere just growing again like themselves, (Harriet, as Emma must suspect,\nas ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy,) when the carriage\nreappeared, and all was over. The style of the visit, and the shortness\nof it, were then felt to be decisive. Fourteen minutes to be given\nto those with whom she had thankfully passed six weeks not six months\nago!--Emma could not but picture it all, and feel how justly they might\nresent, how naturally Harriet must suffer. It was a bad business. She\nwould have given a great deal, or endured a great deal, to have had\nthe Martins in a higher rank of life. They were so deserving, that a\n_little_ higher should have been enough: but as it was, how could she\nhave done otherwise?--Impossible!--She could not repent. They must be\nseparated; but there was a great deal of pain in the process--so much\nto herself at this time, that she soon felt the necessity of a little\nconsolation, and resolved on going home by way of Randalls to\nprocure it. Her mind was quite sick of Mr. Elton and the Martins. The\nrefreshment of Randalls was absolutely necessary.\n\nIt was a good scheme; but on driving to the door they heard that neither\n“master nor mistress was at home;” they had both been out some time; the\nman believed they were gone to Hartfield.\n\n“This is too bad,” cried Emma, as they turned away. “And now we shall\njust miss them; too provoking!--I do not know when I have been so\ndisappointed.” And she leaned back in the corner, to indulge her\nmurmurs, or to reason them away; probably a little of both--such being\nthe commonest process of a not ill-disposed mind. Presently the carriage\nstopt; she looked up; it was stopt by Mr. and Mrs. Weston, who were\nstanding to speak to her. There was instant pleasure in the sight of\nthem, and still greater pleasure was conveyed in sound--for Mr. Weston\nimmediately accosted her with,\n\n“How d'ye do?--how d'ye do?--We have been sitting with your father--glad\nto see him so well. Frank comes to-morrow--I had a letter this\nmorning--we see him to-morrow by dinner-time to a certainty--he is at\nOxford to-day, and he comes for a whole fortnight; I knew it would be\nso. If he had come at Christmas he could not have staid three days; I\nwas always glad he did not come at Christmas; now we are going to have\njust the right weather for him, fine, dry, settled weather. We shall\nenjoy him completely; every thing has turned out exactly as we could\nwish.”\n\nThere was no resisting such news, no possibility of avoiding the\ninfluence of such a happy face as Mr. Weston's, confirmed as it all was\nby the words and the countenance of his wife, fewer and quieter, but not\nless to the purpose. To know that _she_ thought his coming certain was\nenough to make Emma consider it so, and sincerely did she rejoice in\ntheir joy. It was a most delightful reanimation of exhausted spirits.\nThe worn-out past was sunk in the freshness of what was coming; and in\nthe rapidity of half a moment's thought, she hoped Mr. Elton would now\nbe talked of no more.\n\nMr. Weston gave her the history of the engagements at Enscombe, which\nallowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his command,\nas well as the route and the method of his journey; and she listened,\nand smiled, and congratulated.\n\n“I shall soon bring him over to Hartfield,” said he, at the conclusion.\n\nEmma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech, from his\nwife.\n\n“We had better move on, Mr. Weston,” said she, “we are detaining the\ngirls.”\n\n“Well, well, I am ready;”--and turning again to Emma, “but you must\nnot be expecting such a _very_ fine young man; you have only\nhad _my_ account you know; I dare say he is really nothing\nextraordinary:”--though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were\nspeaking a very different conviction.\n\nEmma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent, and answer in a\nmanner that appropriated nothing.\n\n“Think of me to-morrow, my dear Emma, about four o'clock,” was Mrs.\nWeston's parting injunction; spoken with some anxiety, and meant only\nfor her.\n\n“Four o'clock!--depend upon it he will be here by three,” was Mr.\nWeston's quick amendment; and so ended a most satisfactory meeting.\nEmma's spirits were mounted quite up to happiness; every thing wore\na different air; James and his horses seemed not half so sluggish as\nbefore. When she looked at the hedges, she thought the elder at least\nmust soon be coming out; and when she turned round to Harriet, she saw\nsomething like a look of spring, a tender smile even there.\n\n“Will Mr. Frank Churchill pass through Bath as well as Oxford?”--was a\nquestion, however, which did not augur much.\n\nBut neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once, and Emma\nwas now in a humour to resolve that they should both come in time.\n\nThe morning of the interesting day arrived, and Mrs. Weston's faithful\npupil did not forget either at ten, or eleven, or twelve o'clock, that\nshe was to think of her at four.\n\n“My dear, dear anxious friend,”--said she, in mental soliloquy, while\nwalking downstairs from her own room, “always overcareful for every\nbody's comfort but your own; I see you now in all your little fidgets,\ngoing again and again into his room, to be sure that all is right.”\n The clock struck twelve as she passed through the hall. “'Tis twelve;\nI shall not forget to think of you four hours hence; and by this\ntime to-morrow, perhaps, or a little later, I may be thinking of the\npossibility of their all calling here. I am sure they will bring him\nsoon.”\n\nShe opened the parlour door, and saw two gentlemen sitting with her\nfather--Mr. Weston and his son. They had been arrived only a few\nminutes, and Mr. Weston had scarcely finished his explanation of Frank's\nbeing a day before his time, and her father was yet in the midst of his\nvery civil welcome and congratulations, when she appeared, to have her\nshare of surprize, introduction, and pleasure.\n\nThe Frank Churchill so long talked of, so high in interest, was actually\nbefore her--he was presented to her, and she did not think too much had\nbeen said in his praise; he was a _very_ good looking young man; height,\nair, address, all were unexceptionable, and his countenance had a great\ndeal of the spirit and liveliness of his father's; he looked quick and\nsensible. She felt immediately that she should like him; and there was\na well-bred ease of manner, and a readiness to talk, which convinced her\nthat he came intending to be acquainted with her, and that acquainted\nthey soon must be.\n\nHe had reached Randalls the evening before. She was pleased with the\neagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan, and travel\nearlier, later, and quicker, that he might gain half a day.\n\n“I told you yesterday,” cried Mr. Weston with exultation, “I told you\nall that he would be here before the time named. I remembered what I\nused to do myself. One cannot creep upon a journey; one cannot help\ngetting on faster than one has planned; and the pleasure of coming in\nupon one's friends before the look-out begins, is worth a great deal\nmore than any little exertion it needs.”\n\n“It is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it,” said the young\nman, “though there are not many houses that I should presume on so far;\nbut in coming _home_ I felt I might do any thing.”\n\nThe word _home_ made his father look on him with fresh complacency.\nEmma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable; the\nconviction was strengthened by what followed. He was very much pleased\nwith Randalls, thought it a most admirably arranged house, would hardly\nallow it even to be very small, admired the situation, the walk to\nHighbury, Highbury itself, Hartfield still more, and professed himself\nto have always felt the sort of interest in the country which none but\none's _own_ country gives, and the greatest curiosity to visit it. That\nhe should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before,\npassed suspiciously through Emma's brain; but still, if it were a\nfalsehood, it was a pleasant one, and pleasantly handled. His manner had\nno air of study or exaggeration. He did really look and speak as if in a\nstate of no common enjoyment.\n\nTheir subjects in general were such as belong to an opening\nacquaintance. On his side were the inquiries,--“Was she a\nhorsewoman?--Pleasant rides?--Pleasant walks?--Had they a large\nneighbourhood?--Highbury, perhaps, afforded society enough?--There were\nseveral very pretty houses in and about it.--Balls--had they balls?--Was\nit a musical society?”\n\nBut when satisfied on all these points, and their acquaintance\nproportionably advanced, he contrived to find an opportunity, while\ntheir two fathers were engaged with each other, of introducing his\nmother-in-law, and speaking of her with so much handsome praise, so much\nwarm admiration, so much gratitude for the happiness she secured to his\nfather, and her very kind reception of himself, as was an additional\nproof of his knowing how to please--and of his certainly thinking it\nworth while to try to please her. He did not advance a word of praise\nbeyond what she knew to be thoroughly deserved by Mrs. Weston; but,\nundoubtedly he could know very little of the matter. He understood\nwhat would be welcome; he could be sure of little else. “His father's\nmarriage,” he said, “had been the wisest measure, every friend must\nrejoice in it; and the family from whom he had received such a blessing\nmust be ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation on\nhim.”\n\nHe got as near as he could to thanking her for Miss Taylor's merits,\nwithout seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it\nwas to be rather supposed that Miss Taylor had formed Miss Woodhouse's\ncharacter, than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor's. And at last, as if\nresolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its\nobject, he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of\nher person.\n\n“Elegant, agreeable manners, I was prepared for,” said he; “but I\nconfess that, considering every thing, I had not expected more than a\nvery tolerably well-looking woman of a certain age; I did not know that\nI was to find a pretty young woman in Mrs. Weston.”\n\n“You cannot see too much perfection in Mrs. Weston for my feelings,”\n said Emma; “were you to guess her to be _eighteen_, I should listen with\npleasure; but _she_ would be ready to quarrel with you for using such\nwords. Don't let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty\nyoung woman.”\n\n“I hope I should know better,” he replied; “no, depend upon it, (with a\ngallant bow,) that in addressing Mrs. Weston I should understand whom\nI might praise without any danger of being thought extravagant in my\nterms.”\n\nEmma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected from\ntheir knowing each other, which had taken strong possession of her mind,\nhad ever crossed his; and whether his compliments were to be considered\nas marks of acquiescence, or proofs of defiance. She must see more\nof him to understand his ways; at present she only felt they were\nagreeable.\n\nShe had no doubt of what Mr. Weston was often thinking about. His quick\neye she detected again and again glancing towards them with a happy\nexpression; and even, when he might have determined not to look, she was\nconfident that he was often listening.\n\nHer own father's perfect exemption from any thought of the kind, the\nentire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration or suspicion,\nwas a most comfortable circumstance. Happily he was not farther from\napproving matrimony than from foreseeing it.--Though always objecting\nto every marriage that was arranged, he never suffered beforehand from\nthe apprehension of any; it seemed as if he could not think so ill of\nany two persons' understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it\nwere proved against them. She blessed the favouring blindness. He could\nnow, without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise, without a\nglance forward at any possible treachery in his guest, give way to all\nhis natural kind-hearted civility in solicitous inquiries after Mr.\nFrank Churchill's accommodation on his journey, through the sad evils\nof sleeping two nights on the road, and express very genuine unmixed\nanxiety to know that he had certainly escaped catching cold--which,\nhowever, he could not allow him to feel quite assured of himself till\nafter another night.\n\nA reasonable visit paid, Mr. Weston began to move.--“He must be going.\nHe had business at the Crown about his hay, and a great many errands for\nMrs. Weston at Ford's, but he need not hurry any body else.” His son,\ntoo well bred to hear the hint, rose immediately also, saying,\n\n“As you are going farther on business, sir, I will take the opportunity\nof paying a visit, which must be paid some day or other, and therefore\nmay as well be paid now. I have the honour of being acquainted with\na neighbour of yours, (turning to Emma,) a lady residing in or near\nHighbury; a family of the name of Fairfax. I shall have no difficulty,\nI suppose, in finding the house; though Fairfax, I believe, is not\nthe proper name--I should rather say Barnes, or Bates. Do you know any\nfamily of that name?”\n\n“To be sure we do,” cried his father; “Mrs. Bates--we passed her\nhouse--I saw Miss Bates at the window. True, true, you are acquainted\nwith Miss Fairfax; I remember you knew her at Weymouth, and a fine girl\nshe is. Call upon her, by all means.”\n\n“There is no necessity for my calling this morning,” said the young man;\n“another day would do as well; but there was that degree of acquaintance\nat Weymouth which--”\n\n“Oh! go to-day, go to-day. Do not defer it. What is right to be done\ncannot be done too soon. And, besides, I must give you a hint, Frank;\nany want of attention to her _here_ should be carefully avoided. You saw\nher with the Campbells, when she was the equal of every body she mixed\nwith, but here she is with a poor old grandmother, who has barely enough\nto live on. If you do not call early it will be a slight.”\n\nThe son looked convinced.\n\n“I have heard her speak of the acquaintance,” said Emma; “she is a very\nelegant young woman.”\n\nHe agreed to it, but with so quiet a “Yes,” as inclined her almost to\ndoubt his real concurrence; and yet there must be a very distinct sort\nof elegance for the fashionable world, if Jane Fairfax could be thought\nonly ordinarily gifted with it.\n\n“If you were never particularly struck by her manners before,” said she,\n“I think you will to-day. You will see her to advantage; see her and\nhear her--no, I am afraid you will not hear her at all, for she has an\naunt who never holds her tongue.”\n\n“You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax, sir, are you?” said Mr.\nWoodhouse, always the last to make his way in conversation; “then give\nme leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young\nlady. She is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt, very\nworthy people; I have known them all my life. They will be extremely\nglad to see you, I am sure; and one of my servants shall go with you to\nshew you the way.”\n\n“My dear sir, upon no account in the world; my father can direct me.”\n\n“But your father is not going so far; he is only going to the Crown,\nquite on the other side of the street, and there are a great many\nhouses; you might be very much at a loss, and it is a very dirty walk,\nunless you keep on the footpath; but my coachman can tell you where you\nhad best cross the street.”\n\nMr. Frank Churchill still declined it, looking as serious as he could,\nand his father gave his hearty support by calling out, “My good friend,\nthis is quite unnecessary; Frank knows a puddle of water when he sees\nit, and as to Mrs. Bates's, he may get there from the Crown in a hop,\nstep, and jump.”\n\nThey were permitted to go alone; and with a cordial nod from one, and a\ngraceful bow from the other, the two gentlemen took leave. Emma remained\nvery well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance, and could now\nengage to think of them all at Randalls any hour of the day, with full\nconfidence in their comfort.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nThe next morning brought Mr. Frank Churchill again. He came with Mrs.\nWeston, to whom and to Highbury he seemed to take very cordially. He had\nbeen sitting with her, it appeared, most companionably at home, till\nher usual hour of exercise; and on being desired to chuse their walk,\nimmediately fixed on Highbury.--“He did not doubt there being very\npleasant walks in every direction, but if left to him, he should always\nchuse the same. Highbury, that airy, cheerful, happy-looking Highbury,\nwould be his constant attraction.”--Highbury, with Mrs. Weston, stood\nfor Hartfield; and she trusted to its bearing the same construction with\nhim. They walked thither directly.\n\nEmma had hardly expected them: for Mr. Weston, who had called in for\nhalf a minute, in order to hear that his son was very handsome, knew\nnothing of their plans; and it was an agreeable surprize to her,\ntherefore, to perceive them walking up to the house together, arm in\narm. She was wanting to see him again, and especially to see him in\ncompany with Mrs. Weston, upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of him\nwas to depend. If he were deficient there, nothing should make amends\nfor it. But on seeing them together, she became perfectly satisfied. It\nwas not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he paid his\nduty; nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his whole manner to\nher--nothing could more agreeably denote his wish of considering her as\na friend and securing her affection. And there was time enough for Emma\nto form a reasonable judgment, as their visit included all the rest of\nthe morning. They were all three walking about together for an hour\nor two--first round the shrubberies of Hartfield, and afterwards\nin Highbury. He was delighted with every thing; admired Hartfield\nsufficiently for Mr. Woodhouse's ear; and when their going farther was\nresolved on, confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole\nvillage, and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than\nEmma could have supposed.\n\nSome of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings. He\nbegged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long, and\nwhich had been the home of his father's father; and on recollecting that\nan old woman who had nursed him was still living, walked in quest of\nher cottage from one end of the street to the other; and though in\nsome points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit, they\nshewed, altogether, a good-will towards Highbury in general, which must\nbe very like a merit to those he was with.\n\nEmma watched and decided, that with such feelings as were now shewn, it\ncould not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily absenting\nhimself; that he had not been acting a part, or making a parade of\ninsincere professions; and that Mr. Knightley certainly had not done him\njustice.\n\nTheir first pause was at the Crown Inn, an inconsiderable house, though\nthe principal one of the sort, where a couple of pair of post-horses\nwere kept, more for the convenience of the neighbourhood than from any\nrun on the road; and his companions had not expected to be detained by\nany interest excited there; but in passing it they gave the history of\nthe large room visibly added; it had been built many years ago for\na ball-room, and while the neighbourhood had been in a particularly\npopulous, dancing state, had been occasionally used as such;--but such\nbrilliant days had long passed away, and now the highest purpose for\nwhich it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist club established\namong the gentlemen and half-gentlemen of the place. He was immediately\ninterested. Its character as a ball-room caught him; and instead of\npassing on, he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed\nwindows which were open, to look in and contemplate its capabilities,\nand lament that its original purpose should have ceased. He saw no fault\nin the room, he would acknowledge none which they suggested. No, it\nwas long enough, broad enough, handsome enough. It would hold the\nvery number for comfort. They ought to have balls there at least every\nfortnight through the winter. Why had not Miss Woodhouse revived\nthe former good old days of the room?--She who could do any thing in\nHighbury! The want of proper families in the place, and the conviction\nthat none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted\nto attend, were mentioned; but he was not satisfied. He could not be\npersuaded that so many good-looking houses as he saw around him, could\nnot furnish numbers enough for such a meeting; and even when particulars\nwere given and families described, he was still unwilling to admit that\nthe inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing, or that there\nwould be the smallest difficulty in every body's returning into their\nproper place the next morning. He argued like a young man very much bent\non dancing; and Emma was rather surprized to see the constitution of\nthe Weston prevail so decidedly against the habits of the Churchills.\nHe seemed to have all the life and spirit, cheerful feelings, and social\ninclinations of his father, and nothing of the pride or reserve of\nEnscombe. Of pride, indeed, there was, perhaps, scarcely enough; his\nindifference to a confusion of rank, bordered too much on inelegance of\nmind. He could be no judge, however, of the evil he was holding cheap.\nIt was but an effusion of lively spirits.\n\nAt last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the Crown;\nand being now almost facing the house where the Bateses lodged, Emma\nrecollected his intended visit the day before, and asked him if he had\npaid it.\n\n“Yes, oh! yes”--he replied; “I was just going to mention it. A very\nsuccessful visit:--I saw all the three ladies; and felt very much\nobliged to you for your preparatory hint. If the talking aunt had taken\nme quite by surprize, it must have been the death of me. As it was, I\nwas only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit. Ten minutes\nwould have been all that was necessary, perhaps all that was proper; and\nI had told my father I should certainly be at home before him--but there\nwas no getting away, no pause; and, to my utter astonishment, I found,\nwhen he (finding me nowhere else) joined me there at last, that I had\nbeen actually sitting with them very nearly three-quarters of an hour.\nThe good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before.”\n\n“And how did you think Miss Fairfax looking?”\n\n“Ill, very ill--that is, if a young lady can ever be allowed to look\nill. But the expression is hardly admissible, Mrs. Weston, is it? Ladies\ncan never look ill. And, seriously, Miss Fairfax is naturally so\npale, as almost always to give the appearance of ill health.--A most\ndeplorable want of complexion.”\n\nEmma would not agree to this, and began a warm defence of Miss Fairfax's\ncomplexion. “It was certainly never brilliant, but she would not\nallow it to have a sickly hue in general; and there was a softness and\ndelicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of\nher face.” He listened with all due deference; acknowledged that he had\nheard many people say the same--but yet he must confess, that to him\nnothing could make amends for the want of the fine glow of health. Where\nfeatures were indifferent, a fine complexion gave beauty to them all;\nand where they were good, the effect was--fortunately he need not\nattempt to describe what the effect was.\n\n“Well,” said Emma, “there is no disputing about taste.--At least you\nadmire her except her complexion.”\n\nHe shook his head and laughed.--“I cannot separate Miss Fairfax and her\ncomplexion.”\n\n“Did you see her often at Weymouth? Were you often in the same society?”\n\nAt this moment they were approaching Ford's, and he hastily exclaimed,\n“Ha! this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of\ntheir lives, as my father informs me. He comes to Highbury himself, he\nsays, six days out of the seven, and has always business at Ford's.\nIf it be not inconvenient to you, pray let us go in, that I may prove\nmyself to belong to the place, to be a true citizen of Highbury. I must\nbuy something at Ford's. It will be taking out my freedom.--I dare say\nthey sell gloves.”\n\n“Oh! yes, gloves and every thing. I do admire your patriotism. You will\nbe adored in Highbury. You were very popular before you came, because\nyou were Mr. Weston's son--but lay out half a guinea at Ford's, and your\npopularity will stand upon your own virtues.”\n\nThey went in; and while the sleek, well-tied parcels of “Men's Beavers”\n and “York Tan” were bringing down and displaying on the counter, he\nsaid--“But I beg your pardon, Miss Woodhouse, you were speaking to me,\nyou were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my _amor_\n_patriae_. Do not let me lose it. I assure you the utmost stretch of\npublic fame would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness in\nprivate life.”\n\n“I merely asked, whether you had known much of Miss Fairfax and her\nparty at Weymouth.”\n\n“And now that I understand your question, I must pronounce it to be a\nvery unfair one. It is always the lady's right to decide on the degree\nof acquaintance. Miss Fairfax must already have given her account.--I\nshall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow.”\n\n“Upon my word! you answer as discreetly as she could do herself. But\nher account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed, she is so very\nreserved, so very unwilling to give the least information about any\nbody, that I really think you may say what you like of your acquaintance\nwith her.”\n\n“May I, indeed?--Then I will speak the truth, and nothing suits me so\nwell. I met her frequently at Weymouth. I had known the Campbells a\nlittle in town; and at Weymouth we were very much in the same set.\nColonel Campbell is a very agreeable man, and Mrs. Campbell a friendly,\nwarm-hearted woman. I like them all.”\n\n“You know Miss Fairfax's situation in life, I conclude; what she is\ndestined to be?”\n\n“Yes--(rather hesitatingly)--I believe I do.”\n\n“You get upon delicate subjects, Emma,” said Mrs. Weston smiling;\n“remember that I am here.--Mr. Frank Churchill hardly knows what to say\nwhen you speak of Miss Fairfax's situation in life. I will move a little\nfarther off.”\n\n“I certainly do forget to think of _her_,” said Emma, “as having ever\nbeen any thing but my friend and my dearest friend.”\n\nHe looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment.\n\nWhen the gloves were bought, and they had quitted the shop again, “Did\nyou ever hear the young lady we were speaking of, play?” said Frank\nChurchill.\n\n“Ever hear her!” repeated Emma. “You forget how much she belongs to\nHighbury. I have heard her every year of our lives since we both began.\nShe plays charmingly.”\n\n“You think so, do you?--I wanted the opinion of some one who\ncould really judge. She appeared to me to play well, that is, with\nconsiderable taste, but I know nothing of the matter myself.--I am\nexcessively fond of music, but without the smallest skill or right\nof judging of any body's performance.--I have been used to hear her's\nadmired; and I remember one proof of her being thought to play well:--a\nman, a very musical man, and in love with another woman--engaged to\nher--on the point of marriage--would yet never ask that other woman\nto sit down to the instrument, if the lady in question could sit down\ninstead--never seemed to like to hear one if he could hear the other.\nThat, I thought, in a man of known musical talent, was some proof.”\n\n“Proof indeed!” said Emma, highly amused.--“Mr. Dixon is very musical,\nis he? We shall know more about them all, in half an hour, from you,\nthan Miss Fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year.”\n\n“Yes, Mr. Dixon and Miss Campbell were the persons; and I thought it a\nvery strong proof.”\n\n“Certainly--very strong it was; to own the truth, a great deal stronger\nthan, if _I_ had been Miss Campbell, would have been at all agreeable\nto me. I could not excuse a man's having more music than love--more ear\nthan eye--a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings.\nHow did Miss Campbell appear to like it?”\n\n“It was her very particular friend, you know.”\n\n“Poor comfort!” said Emma, laughing. “One would rather have a stranger\npreferred than one's very particular friend--with a stranger it might\nnot recur again--but the misery of having a very particular friend\nalways at hand, to do every thing better than one does oneself!--Poor\nMrs. Dixon! Well, I am glad she is gone to settle in Ireland.”\n\n“You are right. It was not very flattering to Miss Campbell; but she\nreally did not seem to feel it.”\n\n“So much the better--or so much the worse:--I do not know which. But\nbe it sweetness or be it stupidity in her--quickness of friendship, or\ndulness of feeling--there was one person, I think, who must have felt\nit: Miss Fairfax herself. She must have felt the improper and dangerous\ndistinction.”\n\n“As to that--I do not--”\n\n“Oh! do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax's\nsensations from you, or from any body else. They are known to no human\nbeing, I guess, but herself. But if she continued to play whenever she\nwas asked by Mr. Dixon, one may guess what one chuses.”\n\n“There appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all--”\n he began rather quickly, but checking himself, added, “however, it is\nimpossible for me to say on what terms they really were--how it might\nall be behind the scenes. I can only say that there was smoothness\noutwardly. But you, who have known Miss Fairfax from a child, must be\na better judge of her character, and of how she is likely to conduct\nherself in critical situations, than I can be.”\n\n“I have known her from a child, undoubtedly; we have been children\nand women together; and it is natural to suppose that we should be\nintimate,--that we should have taken to each other whenever she visited\nher friends. But we never did. I hardly know how it has happened; a\nlittle, perhaps, from that wickedness on my side which was prone to take\ndisgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always was,\nby her aunt and grandmother, and all their set. And then, her reserve--I\nnever could attach myself to any one so completely reserved.”\n\n“It is a most repulsive quality, indeed,” said he. “Oftentimes very\nconvenient, no doubt, but never pleasing. There is safety in reserve,\nbut no attraction. One cannot love a reserved person.”\n\n“Not till the reserve ceases towards oneself; and then the attraction\nmay be the greater. But I must be more in want of a friend, or an\nagreeable companion, than I have yet been, to take the trouble of\nconquering any body's reserve to procure one. Intimacy between Miss\nFairfax and me is quite out of the question. I have no reason to think\nill of her--not the least--except that such extreme and perpetual\ncautiousness of word and manner, such a dread of giving a distinct idea\nabout any body, is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something to\nconceal.”\n\nHe perfectly agreed with her: and after walking together so long, and\nthinking so much alike, Emma felt herself so well acquainted with him,\nthat she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting. He was\nnot exactly what she had expected; less of the man of the world in some\nof his notions, less of the spoiled child of fortune, therefore better\nthan she had expected. His ideas seemed more moderate--his feelings\nwarmer. She was particularly struck by his manner of considering Mr.\nElton's house, which, as well as the church, he would go and look at,\nand would not join them in finding much fault with. No, he could not\nbelieve it a bad house; not such a house as a man was to be pitied for\nhaving. If it were to be shared with the woman he loved, he could not\nthink any man to be pitied for having that house. There must be ample\nroom in it for every real comfort. The man must be a blockhead who\nwanted more.\n\nMrs. Weston laughed, and said he did not know what he was talking about.\nUsed only to a large house himself, and without ever thinking how many\nadvantages and accommodations were attached to its size, he could be no\njudge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small one. But Emma,\nin her own mind, determined that he _did_ know what he was talking\nabout, and that he shewed a very amiable inclination to settle early in\nlife, and to marry, from worthy motives. He might not be aware of the\ninroads on domestic peace to be occasioned by no housekeeper's room, or\na bad butler's pantry, but no doubt he did perfectly feel that Enscombe\ncould not make him happy, and that whenever he were attached, he would\nwillingly give up much of wealth to be allowed an early establishment.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nEmma's very good opinion of Frank Churchill was a little shaken the\nfollowing day, by hearing that he was gone off to London, merely to have\nhis hair cut. A sudden freak seemed to have seized him at breakfast, and\nhe had sent for a chaise and set off, intending to return to dinner,\nbut with no more important view that appeared than having his hair cut.\nThere was certainly no harm in his travelling sixteen miles twice over\non such an errand; but there was an air of foppery and nonsense in it\nwhich she could not approve. It did not accord with the rationality of\nplan, the moderation in expense, or even the unselfish warmth of heart,\nwhich she had believed herself to discern in him yesterday. Vanity,\nextravagance, love of change, restlessness of temper, which must be\ndoing something, good or bad; heedlessness as to the pleasure of his\nfather and Mrs. Weston, indifferent as to how his conduct might appear\nin general; he became liable to all these charges. His father only\ncalled him a coxcomb, and thought it a very good story; but that Mrs.\nWeston did not like it, was clear enough, by her passing it over as\nquickly as possible, and making no other comment than that “all young\npeople would have their little whims.”\n\nWith the exception of this little blot, Emma found that his visit\nhitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him. Mrs. Weston\nwas very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he made\nhimself--how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether. He\nappeared to have a very open temper--certainly a very cheerful and\nlively one; she could observe nothing wrong in his notions, a great deal\ndecidedly right; he spoke of his uncle with warm regard, was fond of\ntalking of him--said he would be the best man in the world if he were\nleft to himself; and though there was no being attached to the aunt, he\nacknowledged her kindness with gratitude, and seemed to mean always to\nspeak of her with respect. This was all very promising; and, but for\nsuch an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut, there was nothing to\ndenote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination\nhad given him; the honour, if not of being really in love with her,\nof being at least very near it, and saved only by her own\nindifference--(for still her resolution held of never marrying)--the\nhonour, in short, of being marked out for her by all their joint\nacquaintance.\n\nMr. Weston, on his side, added a virtue to the account which must\nhave some weight. He gave her to understand that Frank admired her\nextremely--thought her very beautiful and very charming; and with so\nmuch to be said for him altogether, she found she must not judge him\nharshly. As Mrs. Weston observed, “all young people would have their\nlittle whims.”\n\nThere was one person among his new acquaintance in Surry, not so\nleniently disposed. In general he was judged, throughout the parishes of\nDonwell and Highbury, with great candour; liberal allowances were made\nfor the little excesses of such a handsome young man--one who smiled so\noften and bowed so well; but there was one spirit among them not to be\nsoftened, from its power of censure, by bows or smiles--Mr. Knightley.\nThe circumstance was told him at Hartfield; for the moment, he was\nsilent; but Emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself,\nover a newspaper he held in his hand, “Hum! just the trifling, silly\nfellow I took him for.” She had half a mind to resent; but an instant's\nobservation convinced her that it was really said only to relieve his\nown feelings, and not meant to provoke; and therefore she let it pass.\n\nAlthough in one instance the bearers of not good tidings, Mr. and\nMrs. Weston's visit this morning was in another respect particularly\nopportune. Something occurred while they were at Hartfield, to make Emma\nwant their advice; and, which was still more lucky, she wanted exactly\nthe advice they gave.\n\nThis was the occurrence:--The Coles had been settled some years in\nHighbury, and were very good sort of people--friendly, liberal, and\nunpretending; but, on the other hand, they were of low origin, in trade,\nand only moderately genteel. On their first coming into the country,\nthey had lived in proportion to their income, quietly, keeping little\ncompany, and that little unexpensively; but the last year or two had\nbrought them a considerable increase of means--the house in town had\nyielded greater profits, and fortune in general had smiled on them. With\ntheir wealth, their views increased; their want of a larger house, their\ninclination for more company. They added to their house, to their number\nof servants, to their expenses of every sort; and by this time were,\nin fortune and style of living, second only to the family at Hartfield.\nTheir love of society, and their new dining-room, prepared every body\nfor their keeping dinner-company; and a few parties, chiefly among the\nsingle men, had already taken place. The regular and best families Emma\ncould hardly suppose they would presume to invite--neither Donwell, nor\nHartfield, nor Randalls. Nothing should tempt _her_ to go, if they did;\nand she regretted that her father's known habits would be giving\nher refusal less meaning than she could wish. The Coles were very\nrespectable in their way, but they ought to be taught that it was not\nfor them to arrange the terms on which the superior families would visit\nthem. This lesson, she very much feared, they would receive only from\nherself; she had little hope of Mr. Knightley, none of Mr. Weston.\n\nBut she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many weeks\nbefore it appeared, that when the insult came at last, it found her\nvery differently affected. Donwell and Randalls had received their\ninvitation, and none had come for her father and herself; and Mrs.\nWeston's accounting for it with “I suppose they will not take the\nliberty with you; they know you do not dine out,” was not quite\nsufficient. She felt that she should like to have had the power of\nrefusal; and afterwards, as the idea of the party to be assembled there,\nconsisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her, occurred\nagain and again, she did not know that she might not have been tempted\nto accept. Harriet was to be there in the evening, and the Bateses. They\nhad been speaking of it as they walked about Highbury the day before,\nand Frank Churchill had most earnestly lamented her absence. Might\nnot the evening end in a dance? had been a question of his. The bare\npossibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her spirits; and\nher being left in solitary grandeur, even supposing the omission to be\nintended as a compliment, was but poor comfort.\n\nIt was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were at\nHartfield, which made their presence so acceptable; for though her first\nremark, on reading it, was that “of course it must be declined,” she so\nvery soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do, that their\nadvice for her going was most prompt and successful.\n\nShe owned that, considering every thing, she was not absolutely\nwithout inclination for the party. The Coles expressed themselves so\nproperly--there was so much real attention in the manner of it--so much\nconsideration for her father. “They would have solicited the honour\nearlier, but had been waiting the arrival of a folding-screen from\nLondon, which they hoped might keep Mr. Woodhouse from any draught of\nair, and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the honour\nof his company.” Upon the whole, she was very persuadable; and it being\nbriefly settled among themselves how it might be done without neglecting\nhis comfort--how certainly Mrs. Goddard, if not Mrs. Bates, might be\ndepended on for bearing him company--Mr. Woodhouse was to be talked\ninto an acquiescence of his daughter's going out to dinner on a day now\nnear at hand, and spending the whole evening away from him. As for _his_\ngoing, Emma did not wish him to think it possible, the hours would be\ntoo late, and the party too numerous. He was soon pretty well resigned.\n\n“I am not fond of dinner-visiting,” said he--“I never was. No more is\nEmma. Late hours do not agree with us. I am sorry Mr. and Mrs. Cole\nshould have done it. I think it would be much better if they would come\nin one afternoon next summer, and take their tea with us--take us\nin their afternoon walk; which they might do, as our hours are so\nreasonable, and yet get home without being out in the damp of the\nevening. The dews of a summer evening are what I would not expose any\nbody to. However, as they are so very desirous to have dear Emma dine\nwith them, and as you will both be there, and Mr. Knightley too, to take\ncare of her, I cannot wish to prevent it, provided the weather be what\nit ought, neither damp, nor cold, nor windy.” Then turning to Mrs.\nWeston, with a look of gentle reproach--“Ah! Miss Taylor, if you had not\nmarried, you would have staid at home with me.”\n\n“Well, sir,” cried Mr. Weston, “as I took Miss Taylor away, it is\nincumbent on me to supply her place, if I can; and I will step to Mrs.\nGoddard in a moment, if you wish it.”\n\nBut the idea of any thing to be done in a _moment_, was increasing,\nnot lessening, Mr. Woodhouse's agitation. The ladies knew better how\nto allay it. Mr. Weston must be quiet, and every thing deliberately\narranged.\n\nWith this treatment, Mr. Woodhouse was soon composed enough for talking\nas usual. “He should be happy to see Mrs. Goddard. He had a great regard\nfor Mrs. Goddard; and Emma should write a line, and invite her. James\ncould take the note. But first of all, there must be an answer written\nto Mrs. Cole.”\n\n“You will make my excuses, my dear, as civilly as possible. You will say\nthat I am quite an invalid, and go no where, and therefore must decline\ntheir obliging invitation; beginning with my _compliments_, of course.\nBut you will do every thing right. I need not tell you what is to be\ndone. We must remember to let James know that the carriage will be\nwanted on Tuesday. I shall have no fears for you with him. We have never\nbeen there above once since the new approach was made; but still I have\nno doubt that James will take you very safely. And when you get there,\nyou must tell him at what time you would have him come for you again;\nand you had better name an early hour. You will not like staying late.\nYou will get very tired when tea is over.”\n\n“But you would not wish me to come away before I am tired, papa?”\n\n“Oh! no, my love; but you will soon be tired. There will be a great many\npeople talking at once. You will not like the noise.”\n\n“But, my dear sir,” cried Mr. Weston, “if Emma comes away early, it will\nbe breaking up the party.”\n\n“And no great harm if it does,” said Mr. Woodhouse. “The sooner every\nparty breaks up, the better.”\n\n“But you do not consider how it may appear to the Coles. Emma's going\naway directly after tea might be giving offence. They are good-natured\npeople, and think little of their own claims; but still they must\nfeel that any body's hurrying away is no great compliment; and Miss\nWoodhouse's doing it would be more thought of than any other person's in\nthe room. You would not wish to disappoint and mortify the Coles, I am\nsure, sir; friendly, good sort of people as ever lived, and who have\nbeen your neighbours these _ten_ years.”\n\n“No, upon no account in the world, Mr. Weston; I am much obliged to\nyou for reminding me. I should be extremely sorry to be giving them any\npain. I know what worthy people they are. Perry tells me that Mr. Cole\nnever touches malt liquor. You would not think it to look at him, but\nhe is bilious--Mr. Cole is very bilious. No, I would not be the means\nof giving them any pain. My dear Emma, we must consider this. I am sure,\nrather than run the risk of hurting Mr. and Mrs. Cole, you would stay a\nlittle longer than you might wish. You will not regard being tired. You\nwill be perfectly safe, you know, among your friends.”\n\n“Oh yes, papa. I have no fears at all for myself; and I should have no\nscruples of staying as late as Mrs. Weston, but on your account. I am\nonly afraid of your sitting up for me. I am not afraid of your not being\nexceedingly comfortable with Mrs. Goddard. She loves piquet, you\nknow; but when she is gone home, I am afraid you will be sitting up by\nyourself, instead of going to bed at your usual time--and the idea of\nthat would entirely destroy my comfort. You must promise me not to sit\nup.”\n\nHe did, on the condition of some promises on her side: such as that,\nif she came home cold, she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly; if\nhungry, that she would take something to eat; that her own maid should\nsit up for her; and that Serle and the butler should see that every\nthing were safe in the house, as usual.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nFrank Churchill came back again; and if he kept his father's dinner\nwaiting, it was not known at Hartfield; for Mrs. Weston was too anxious\nfor his being a favourite with Mr. Woodhouse, to betray any imperfection\nwhich could be concealed.\n\nHe came back, had had his hair cut, and laughed at himself with a very\ngood grace, but without seeming really at all ashamed of what he had\ndone. He had no reason to wish his hair longer, to conceal any confusion\nof face; no reason to wish the money unspent, to improve his spirits.\nHe was quite as undaunted and as lively as ever; and, after seeing him,\nEmma thus moralised to herself:--\n\n“I do not know whether it ought to be so, but certainly silly things\ndo cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent\nway. Wickedness is always wickedness, but folly is not always folly.--It\ndepends upon the character of those who handle it. Mr. Knightley, he is\n_not_ a trifling, silly young man. If he were, he would have done this\ndifferently. He would either have gloried in the achievement, or\nbeen ashamed of it. There would have been either the ostentation of\na coxcomb, or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own\nvanities.--No, I am perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly.”\n\nWith Tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again, and for\na longer time than hitherto; of judging of his general manners, and by\ninference, of the meaning of his manners towards herself; of guessing\nhow soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness into her air;\nand of fancying what the observations of all those might be, who were\nnow seeing them together for the first time.\n\nShe meant to be very happy, in spite of the scene being laid at Mr.\nCole's; and without being able to forget that among the failings of Mr.\nElton, even in the days of his favour, none had disturbed her more than\nhis propensity to dine with Mr. Cole.\n\nHer father's comfort was amply secured, Mrs. Bates as well as Mrs.\nGoddard being able to come; and her last pleasing duty, before she left\nthe house, was to pay her respects to them as they sat together after\ndinner; and while her father was fondly noticing the beauty of her\ndress, to make the two ladies all the amends in her power, by helping\nthem to large slices of cake and full glasses of wine, for whatever\nunwilling self-denial his care of their constitution might have obliged\nthem to practise during the meal.--She had provided a plentiful dinner\nfor them; she wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat\nit.\n\nShe followed another carriage to Mr. Cole's door; and was pleased to see\nthat it was Mr. Knightley's; for Mr. Knightley keeping no horses,\nhaving little spare money and a great deal of health, activity, and\nindependence, was too apt, in Emma's opinion, to get about as he could,\nand not use his carriage so often as became the owner of Donwell Abbey.\nShe had an opportunity now of speaking her approbation while warm from\nher heart, for he stopped to hand her out.\n\n“This is coming as you should do,” said she; “like a gentleman.--I am\nquite glad to see you.”\n\nHe thanked her, observing, “How lucky that we should arrive at the same\nmoment! for, if we had met first in the drawing-room, I doubt whether\nyou would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual.--You\nmight not have distinguished how I came, by my look or manner.”\n\n“Yes I should, I am sure I should. There is always a look of\nconsciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to be\nbeneath them. You think you carry it off very well, I dare say, but\nwith you it is a sort of bravado, an air of affected unconcern; I always\nobserve it whenever I meet you under those circumstances. _Now_ you have\nnothing to try for. You are not afraid of being supposed ashamed. You\nare not striving to look taller than any body else. _Now_ I shall really\nbe very happy to walk into the same room with you.”\n\n“Nonsensical girl!” was his reply, but not at all in anger.\n\nEmma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party as\nwith Mr. Knightley. She was received with a cordial respect which could\nnot but please, and given all the consequence she could wish for.\nWhen the Westons arrived, the kindest looks of love, the strongest of\nadmiration were for her, from both husband and wife; the son approached\nher with a cheerful eagerness which marked her as his peculiar object,\nand at dinner she found him seated by her--and, as she firmly believed,\nnot without some dexterity on his side.\n\nThe party was rather large, as it included one other family, a proper\nunobjectionable country family, whom the Coles had the advantage of\nnaming among their acquaintance, and the male part of Mr. Cox's family,\nthe lawyer of Highbury. The less worthy females were to come in the\nevening, with Miss Bates, Miss Fairfax, and Miss Smith; but already,\nat dinner, they were too numerous for any subject of conversation to be\ngeneral; and, while politics and Mr. Elton were talked over, Emma could\nfairly surrender all her attention to the pleasantness of her neighbour.\nThe first remote sound to which she felt herself obliged to attend, was\nthe name of Jane Fairfax. Mrs. Cole seemed to be relating something of\nher that was expected to be very interesting. She listened, and found\nit well worth listening to. That very dear part of Emma, her fancy,\nreceived an amusing supply. Mrs. Cole was telling that she had been\ncalling on Miss Bates, and as soon as she entered the room had\nbeen struck by the sight of a pianoforte--a very elegant looking\ninstrument--not a grand, but a large-sized square pianoforte; and the\nsubstance of the story, the end of all the dialogue which ensued of\nsurprize, and inquiry, and congratulations on her side, and explanations\non Miss Bates's, was, that this pianoforte had arrived from\nBroadwood's the day before, to the great astonishment of both aunt and\nniece--entirely unexpected; that at first, by Miss Bates's account,\nJane herself was quite at a loss, quite bewildered to think who could\npossibly have ordered it--but now, they were both perfectly satisfied\nthat it could be from only one quarter;--of course it must be from\nColonel Campbell.\n\n“One can suppose nothing else,” added Mrs. Cole, “and I was only\nsurprized that there could ever have been a doubt. But Jane, it seems,\nhad a letter from them very lately, and not a word was said about it.\nShe knows their ways best; but I should not consider their silence as\nany reason for their not meaning to make the present. They might chuse\nto surprize her.”\n\nMrs. Cole had many to agree with her; every body who spoke on the\nsubject was equally convinced that it must come from Colonel Campbell,\nand equally rejoiced that such a present had been made; and there were\nenough ready to speak to allow Emma to think her own way, and still\nlisten to Mrs. Cole.\n\n“I declare, I do not know when I have heard any thing that has given me\nmore satisfaction!--It always has quite hurt me that Jane Fairfax, who\nplays so delightfully, should not have an instrument. It seemed quite\na shame, especially considering how many houses there are where fine\ninstruments are absolutely thrown away. This is like giving ourselves\na slap, to be sure! and it was but yesterday I was telling Mr. Cole,\nI really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the\ndrawing-room, while I do not know one note from another, and our little\ngirls, who are but just beginning, perhaps may never make any thing of\nit; and there is poor Jane Fairfax, who is mistress of music, has not\nany thing of the nature of an instrument, not even the pitifullest old\nspinet in the world, to amuse herself with.--I was saying this to\nMr. Cole but yesterday, and he quite agreed with me; only he is so\nparticularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself\nin the purchase, hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so\nobliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can; and that\nreally is the reason why the instrument was bought--or else I am sure\nwe ought to be ashamed of it.--We are in great hopes that Miss Woodhouse\nmay be prevailed with to try it this evening.”\n\nMiss Woodhouse made the proper acquiescence; and finding that nothing\nmore was to be entrapped from any communication of Mrs. Cole's, turned\nto Frank Churchill.\n\n“Why do you smile?” said she.\n\n“Nay, why do you?”\n\n“Me!--I suppose I smile for pleasure at Colonel Campbell's being so rich\nand so liberal.--It is a handsome present.”\n\n“Very.”\n\n“I rather wonder that it was never made before.”\n\n“Perhaps Miss Fairfax has never been staying here so long before.”\n\n“Or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument--which must\nnow be shut up in London, untouched by any body.”\n\n“That is a grand pianoforte, and he might think it too large for Mrs.\nBates's house.”\n\n“You may _say_ what you chuse--but your countenance testifies that your\n_thoughts_ on this subject are very much like mine.”\n\n“I do not know. I rather believe you are giving me more credit for\nacuteness than I deserve. I smile because you smile, and shall probably\nsuspect whatever I find you suspect; but at present I do not see what\nthere is to question. If Colonel Campbell is not the person, who can\nbe?”\n\n“What do you say to Mrs. Dixon?”\n\n“Mrs. Dixon! very true indeed. I had not thought of Mrs. Dixon. She must\nknow as well as her father, how acceptable an instrument would be; and\nperhaps the mode of it, the mystery, the surprize, is more like a young\nwoman's scheme than an elderly man's. It is Mrs. Dixon, I dare say. I\ntold you that your suspicions would guide mine.”\n\n“If so, you must extend your suspicions and comprehend _Mr_. Dixon in\nthem.”\n\n“Mr. Dixon.--Very well. Yes, I immediately perceive that it must be the\njoint present of Mr. and Mrs. Dixon. We were speaking the other day, you\nknow, of his being so warm an admirer of her performance.”\n\n“Yes, and what you told me on that head, confirmed an idea which I had\nentertained before.--I do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions\nof either Mr. Dixon or Miss Fairfax, but I cannot help suspecting either\nthat, after making his proposals to her friend, he had the misfortune\nto fall in love with _her_, or that he became conscious of a little\nattachment on her side. One might guess twenty things without guessing\nexactly the right; but I am sure there must be a particular cause for\nher chusing to come to Highbury instead of going with the Campbells\nto Ireland. Here, she must be leading a life of privation and penance;\nthere it would have been all enjoyment. As to the pretence of trying her\nnative air, I look upon that as a mere excuse.--In the summer it might\nhave passed; but what can any body's native air do for them in the\nmonths of January, February, and March? Good fires and carriages would\nbe much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health, and I dare\nsay in her's. I do not require you to adopt all my suspicions, though\nyou make so noble a profession of doing it, but I honestly tell you what\nthey are.”\n\n“And, upon my word, they have an air of great probability. Mr. Dixon's\npreference of her music to her friend's, I can answer for being very\ndecided.”\n\n“And then, he saved her life. Did you ever hear of that?--A water\nparty; and by some accident she was falling overboard. He caught her.”\n\n“He did. I was there--one of the party.”\n\n“Were you really?--Well!--But you observed nothing of course, for it\nseems to be a new idea to you.--If I had been there, I think I should\nhave made some discoveries.”\n\n“I dare say you would; but I, simple I, saw nothing but the fact, that\nMiss Fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that Mr. Dixon caught\nher.--It was the work of a moment. And though the consequent shock and\nalarm was very great and much more durable--indeed I believe it was\nhalf an hour before any of us were comfortable again--yet that was too\ngeneral a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be\nobservable. I do not mean to say, however, that you might not have made\ndiscoveries.”\n\nThe conversation was here interrupted. They were called on to share\nin the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses, and\nobliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others; but when the table\nwas again safely covered, when every corner dish was placed exactly\nright, and occupation and ease were generally restored, Emma said,\n\n“The arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me. I wanted to know\na little more, and this tells me quite enough. Depend upon it, we shall\nsoon hear that it is a present from Mr. and Mrs. Dixon.”\n\n“And if the Dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we must\nconclude it to come from the Campbells.”\n\n“No, I am sure it is not from the Campbells. Miss Fairfax knows it is\nnot from the Campbells, or they would have been guessed at first. She\nwould not have been puzzled, had she dared fix on them. I may not have\nconvinced you perhaps, but I am perfectly convinced myself that Mr.\nDixon is a principal in the business.”\n\n“Indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced. Your reasonings\ncarry my judgment along with them entirely. At first, while I supposed\nyou satisfied that Colonel Campbell was the giver, I saw it only as\npaternal kindness, and thought it the most natural thing in the world.\nBut when you mentioned Mrs. Dixon, I felt how much more probable that it\nshould be the tribute of warm female friendship. And now I can see it in\nno other light than as an offering of love.”\n\nThere was no occasion to press the matter farther. The conviction seemed\nreal; he looked as if he felt it. She said no more, other subjects\ntook their turn; and the rest of the dinner passed away; the dessert\nsucceeded, the children came in, and were talked to and admired amid the\nusual rate of conversation; a few clever things said, a few downright\nsilly, but by much the larger proportion neither the one nor the\nother--nothing worse than everyday remarks, dull repetitions, old news,\nand heavy jokes.\n\nThe ladies had not been long in the drawing-room, before the other\nladies, in their different divisions, arrived. Emma watched the entree\nof her own particular little friend; and if she could not exult in her\ndignity and grace, she could not only love the blooming sweetness and\nthe artless manner, but could most heartily rejoice in that light,\ncheerful, unsentimental disposition which allowed her so many\nalleviations of pleasure, in the midst of the pangs of disappointed\naffection. There she sat--and who would have guessed how many tears she\nhad been lately shedding? To be in company, nicely dressed herself and\nseeing others nicely dressed, to sit and smile and look pretty, and say\nnothing, was enough for the happiness of the present hour. Jane Fairfax\ndid look and move superior; but Emma suspected she might have been\nglad to change feelings with Harriet, very glad to have purchased the\nmortification of having loved--yes, of having loved even Mr. Elton in\nvain--by the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herself\nbeloved by the husband of her friend.\n\nIn so large a party it was not necessary that Emma should approach her.\nShe did not wish to speak of the pianoforte, she felt too much in the\nsecret herself, to think the appearance of curiosity or interest fair,\nand therefore purposely kept at a distance; but by the others, the\nsubject was almost immediately introduced, and she saw the blush of\nconsciousness with which congratulations were received, the blush\nof guilt which accompanied the name of “my excellent friend Colonel\nCampbell.”\n\nMrs. Weston, kind-hearted and musical, was particularly interested\nby the circumstance, and Emma could not help being amused at her\nperseverance in dwelling on the subject; and having so much to ask and\nto say as to tone, touch, and pedal, totally unsuspicious of that wish\nof saying as little about it as possible, which she plainly read in the\nfair heroine's countenance.\n\nThey were soon joined by some of the gentlemen; and the very first\nof the early was Frank Churchill. In he walked, the first and the\nhandsomest; and after paying his compliments en passant to Miss Bates\nand her niece, made his way directly to the opposite side of the circle,\nwhere sat Miss Woodhouse; and till he could find a seat by her, would\nnot sit at all. Emma divined what every body present must be thinking.\nShe was his object, and every body must perceive it. She introduced him\nto her friend, Miss Smith, and, at convenient moments afterwards, heard\nwhat each thought of the other. “He had never seen so lovely a face, and\nwas delighted with her naivete.” And she, “Only to be sure it was paying\nhim too great a compliment, but she did think there were some looks a\nlittle like Mr. Elton.” Emma restrained her indignation, and only turned\nfrom her in silence.\n\nSmiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first\nglancing towards Miss Fairfax; but it was most prudent to avoid speech.\nHe told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining-room--hated\nsitting long--was always the first to move when he could--that his\nfather, Mr. Knightley, Mr. Cox, and Mr. Cole, were left very busy over\nparish business--that as long as he had staid, however, it had been\npleasant enough, as he had found them in general a set of gentlemanlike,\nsensible men; and spoke so handsomely of Highbury altogether--thought it\nso abundant in agreeable families--that Emma began to feel she had been\nused to despise the place rather too much. She questioned him as to the\nsociety in Yorkshire--the extent of the neighbourhood about Enscombe,\nand the sort; and could make out from his answers that, as far as\nEnscombe was concerned, there was very little going on, that their\nvisitings were among a range of great families, none very near; and\nthat even when days were fixed, and invitations accepted, it was an even\nchance that Mrs. Churchill were not in health and spirits for going;\nthat they made a point of visiting no fresh person; and that, though\nhe had his separate engagements, it was not without difficulty, without\nconsiderable address _at_ _times_, that he could get away, or introduce\nan acquaintance for a night.\n\nShe saw that Enscombe could not satisfy, and that Highbury, taken at\nits best, might reasonably please a young man who had more retirement at\nhome than he liked. His importance at Enscombe was very evident. He did\nnot boast, but it naturally betrayed itself, that he had persuaded his\naunt where his uncle could do nothing, and on her laughing and noticing\nit, he owned that he believed (excepting one or two points) he could\n_with_ _time_ persuade her to any thing. One of those points on which\nhis influence failed, he then mentioned. He had wanted very much to\ngo abroad--had been very eager indeed to be allowed to travel--but she\nwould not hear of it. This had happened the year before. _Now_, he said,\nhe was beginning to have no longer the same wish.\n\nThe unpersuadable point, which he did not mention, Emma guessed to be\ngood behaviour to his father.\n\n“I have made a most wretched discovery,” said he, after a short pause.--\n“I have been here a week to-morrow--half my time. I never knew days fly\nso fast. A week to-morrow!--And I have hardly begun to enjoy myself.\nBut just got acquainted with Mrs. Weston, and others!--I hate the\nrecollection.”\n\n“Perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day, out\nof so few, in having your hair cut.”\n\n“No,” said he, smiling, “that is no subject of regret at all. I have\nno pleasure in seeing my friends, unless I can believe myself fit to be\nseen.”\n\nThe rest of the gentlemen being now in the room, Emma found herself\nobliged to turn from him for a few minutes, and listen to Mr. Cole. When\nMr. Cole had moved away, and her attention could be restored as before,\nshe saw Frank Churchill looking intently across the room at Miss\nFairfax, who was sitting exactly opposite.\n\n“What is the matter?” said she.\n\nHe started. “Thank you for rousing me,” he replied. “I believe I have\nbeen very rude; but really Miss Fairfax has done her hair in so odd a\nway--so very odd a way--that I cannot keep my eyes from her. I never saw\nany thing so outree!--Those curls!--This must be a fancy of her own. I\nsee nobody else looking like her!--I must go and ask her whether it\nis an Irish fashion. Shall I?--Yes, I will--I declare I will--and you\nshall see how she takes it;--whether she colours.”\n\nHe was gone immediately; and Emma soon saw him standing before Miss\nFairfax, and talking to her; but as to its effect on the young lady,\nas he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them, exactly in\nfront of Miss Fairfax, she could absolutely distinguish nothing.\n\nBefore he could return to his chair, it was taken by Mrs. Weston.\n\n“This is the luxury of a large party,” said she:--“one can get near\nevery body, and say every thing. My dear Emma, I am longing to talk\nto you. I have been making discoveries and forming plans, just like\nyourself, and I must tell them while the idea is fresh. Do you know how\nMiss Bates and her niece came here?”\n\n“How?--They were invited, were not they?”\n\n“Oh! yes--but how they were conveyed hither?--the manner of their\ncoming?”\n\n“They walked, I conclude. How else could they come?”\n\n“Very true.--Well, a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad\nit would be to have Jane Fairfax walking home again, late at night, and\ncold as the nights are now. And as I looked at her, though I never saw\nher appear to more advantage, it struck me that she was heated, and\nwould therefore be particularly liable to take cold. Poor girl! I could\nnot bear the idea of it; so, as soon as Mr. Weston came into the room,\nand I could get at him, I spoke to him about the carriage. You may guess\nhow readily he came into my wishes; and having his approbation, I made\nmy way directly to Miss Bates, to assure her that the carriage would be\nat her service before it took us home; for I thought it would be making\nher comfortable at once. Good soul! she was as grateful as possible, you\nmay be sure. 'Nobody was ever so fortunate as herself!'--but with many,\nmany thanks--'there was no occasion to trouble us, for Mr. Knightley's\ncarriage had brought, and was to take them home again.' I was quite\nsurprized;--very glad, I am sure; but really quite surprized. Such a\nvery kind attention--and so thoughtful an attention!--the sort of thing\nthat so few men would think of. And, in short, from knowing his\nusual ways, I am very much inclined to think that it was for their\naccommodation the carriage was used at all. I do suspect he would not\nhave had a pair of horses for himself, and that it was only as an excuse\nfor assisting them.”\n\n“Very likely,” said Emma--“nothing more likely. I know no man more\nlikely than Mr. Knightley to do the sort of thing--to do any thing\nreally good-natured, useful, considerate, or benevolent. He is not a\ngallant man, but he is a very humane one; and this, considering Jane\nFairfax's ill-health, would appear a case of humanity to him;--and for\nan act of unostentatious kindness, there is nobody whom I would fix on\nmore than on Mr. Knightley. I know he had horses to-day--for we arrived\ntogether; and I laughed at him about it, but he said not a word that\ncould betray.”\n\n“Well,” said Mrs. Weston, smiling, “you give him credit for more simple,\ndisinterested benevolence in this instance than I do; for while Miss\nBates was speaking, a suspicion darted into my head, and I have never\nbeen able to get it out again. The more I think of it, the more probable\nit appears. In short, I have made a match between Mr. Knightley and Jane\nFairfax. See the consequence of keeping you company!--What do you say to\nit?”\n\n“Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax!” exclaimed Emma. “Dear Mrs. Weston, how\ncould you think of such a thing?--Mr. Knightley!--Mr. Knightley must not\nmarry!--You would not have little Henry cut out from Donwell?--Oh! no,\nno, Henry must have Donwell. I cannot at all consent to Mr. Knightley's\nmarrying; and I am sure it is not at all likely. I am amazed that you\nshould think of such a thing.”\n\n“My dear Emma, I have told you what led me to think of it. I do not want\nthe match--I do not want to injure dear little Henry--but the idea has\nbeen given me by circumstances; and if Mr. Knightley really wished to\nmarry, you would not have him refrain on Henry's account, a boy of six\nyears old, who knows nothing of the matter?”\n\n“Yes, I would. I could not bear to have Henry supplanted.--Mr.\nKnightley marry!--No, I have never had such an idea, and I cannot adopt\nit now. And Jane Fairfax, too, of all women!”\n\n“Nay, she has always been a first favourite with him, as you very well\nknow.”\n\n“But the imprudence of such a match!”\n\n“I am not speaking of its prudence; merely its probability.”\n\n“I see no probability in it, unless you have any better foundation than\nwhat you mention. His good-nature, his humanity, as I tell you, would\nbe quite enough to account for the horses. He has a great regard for the\nBateses, you know, independent of Jane Fairfax--and is always glad to\nshew them attention. My dear Mrs. Weston, do not take to match-making.\nYou do it very ill. Jane Fairfax mistress of the Abbey!--Oh! no,\nno;--every feeling revolts. For his own sake, I would not have him do so\nmad a thing.”\n\n“Imprudent, if you please--but not mad. Excepting inequality of fortune,\nand perhaps a little disparity of age, I can see nothing unsuitable.”\n\n“But Mr. Knightley does not want to marry. I am sure he has not the\nleast idea of it. Do not put it into his head. Why should he marry?--He\nis as happy as possible by himself; with his farm, and his sheep, and\nhis library, and all the parish to manage; and he is extremely fond of\nhis brother's children. He has no occasion to marry, either to fill up\nhis time or his heart.”\n\n“My dear Emma, as long as he thinks so, it is so; but if he really loves\nJane Fairfax--”\n\n“Nonsense! He does not care about Jane Fairfax. In the way of love, I am\nsure he does not. He would do any good to her, or her family; but--”\n\n“Well,” said Mrs. Weston, laughing, “perhaps the greatest good he could\ndo them, would be to give Jane such a respectable home.”\n\n“If it would be good to her, I am sure it would be evil to himself; a\nvery shameful and degrading connexion. How would he bear to have Miss\nBates belonging to him?--To have her haunting the Abbey, and thanking\nhim all day long for his great kindness in marrying Jane?--'So very\nkind and obliging!--But he always had been such a very kind neighbour!'\nAnd then fly off, through half a sentence, to her mother's old\npetticoat. 'Not that it was such a very old petticoat either--for still\nit would last a great while--and, indeed, she must thankfully say that\ntheir petticoats were all very strong.'”\n\n“For shame, Emma! Do not mimic her. You divert me against my conscience.\nAnd, upon my word, I do not think Mr. Knightley would be much disturbed\nby Miss Bates. Little things do not irritate him. She might talk on; and\nif he wanted to say any thing himself, he would only talk louder, and\ndrown her voice. But the question is not, whether it would be a bad\nconnexion for him, but whether he wishes it; and I think he does. I have\nheard him speak, and so must you, so very highly of Jane Fairfax! The\ninterest he takes in her--his anxiety about her health--his concern that\nshe should have no happier prospect! I have heard him express himself\nso warmly on those points!--Such an admirer of her performance on the\npianoforte, and of her voice! I have heard him say that he could listen\nto her for ever. Oh! and I had almost forgotten one idea that occurred\nto me--this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody--though\nwe have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the\nCampbells, may it not be from Mr. Knightley? I cannot help suspecting\nhim. I think he is just the person to do it, even without being in\nlove.”\n\n“Then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love. But I do not\nthink it is at all a likely thing for him to do. Mr. Knightley does\nnothing mysteriously.”\n\n“I have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly; oftener\nthan I should suppose such a circumstance would, in the common course of\nthings, occur to him.”\n\n“Very well; and if he had intended to give her one, he would have told\nher so.”\n\n“There might be scruples of delicacy, my dear Emma. I have a very strong\nnotion that it comes from him. I am sure he was particularly silent when\nMrs. Cole told us of it at dinner.”\n\n“You take up an idea, Mrs. Weston, and run away with it; as you have\nmany a time reproached me with doing. I see no sign of attachment--I\nbelieve nothing of the pianoforte--and proof only shall convince me that\nMr. Knightley has any thought of marrying Jane Fairfax.”\n\nThey combated the point some time longer in the same way; Emma rather\ngaining ground over the mind of her friend; for Mrs. Weston was the most\nused of the two to yield; till a little bustle in the room shewed them\nthat tea was over, and the instrument in preparation;--and at the same\nmoment Mr. Cole approaching to entreat Miss Woodhouse would do them the\nhonour of trying it. Frank Churchill, of whom, in the eagerness of her\nconversation with Mrs. Weston, she had been seeing nothing, except that\nhe had found a seat by Miss Fairfax, followed Mr. Cole, to add his very\npressing entreaties; and as, in every respect, it suited Emma best to\nlead, she gave a very proper compliance.\n\nShe knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more than\nshe could perform with credit; she wanted neither taste nor spirit in\nthe little things which are generally acceptable, and could accompany\nher own voice well. One accompaniment to her song took her agreeably by\nsurprize--a second, slightly but correctly taken by Frank Churchill. Her\npardon was duly begged at the close of the song, and every thing usual\nfollowed. He was accused of having a delightful voice, and a perfect\nknowledge of music; which was properly denied; and that he knew nothing\nof the matter, and had no voice at all, roundly asserted. They sang\ntogether once more; and Emma would then resign her place to Miss\nFairfax, whose performance, both vocal and instrumental, she never could\nattempt to conceal from herself, was infinitely superior to her own.\n\nWith mixed feelings, she seated herself at a little distance from the\nnumbers round the instrument, to listen. Frank Churchill sang again.\nThey had sung together once or twice, it appeared, at Weymouth. But the\nsight of Mr. Knightley among the most attentive, soon drew away half\nEmma's mind; and she fell into a train of thinking on the subject of\nMrs. Weston's suspicions, to which the sweet sounds of the united voices\ngave only momentary interruptions. Her objections to Mr. Knightley's\nmarrying did not in the least subside. She could see nothing but evil\nin it. It would be a great disappointment to Mr. John Knightley;\nconsequently to Isabella. A real injury to the children--a most\nmortifying change, and material loss to them all;--a very great\ndeduction from her father's daily comfort--and, as to herself, she could\nnot at all endure the idea of Jane Fairfax at Donwell Abbey. A Mrs.\nKnightley for them all to give way to!--No--Mr. Knightley must never\nmarry. Little Henry must remain the heir of Donwell.\n\nPresently Mr. Knightley looked back, and came and sat down by her. They\ntalked at first only of the performance. His admiration was certainly\nvery warm; yet she thought, but for Mrs. Weston, it would not have\nstruck her. As a sort of touchstone, however, she began to speak of his\nkindness in conveying the aunt and niece; and though his answer was in\nthe spirit of cutting the matter short, she believed it to indicate only\nhis disinclination to dwell on any kindness of his own.\n\n“I often feel concern,” said she, “that I dare not make our carriage\nmore useful on such occasions. It is not that I am without the wish; but\nyou know how impossible my father would deem it that James should put-to\nfor such a purpose.”\n\n“Quite out of the question, quite out of the question,” he\nreplied;--“but you must often wish it, I am sure.” And he smiled with\nsuch seeming pleasure at the conviction, that she must proceed another\nstep.\n\n“This present from the Campbells,” said she--“this pianoforte is very\nkindly given.”\n\n“Yes,” he replied, and without the smallest apparent\nembarrassment.--“But they would have done better had they given\nher notice of it. Surprizes are foolish things. The pleasure is not\nenhanced, and the inconvenience is often considerable. I should have\nexpected better judgment in Colonel Campbell.”\n\nFrom that moment, Emma could have taken her oath that Mr. Knightley had\nhad no concern in giving the instrument. But whether he were\nentirely free from peculiar attachment--whether there were no actual\npreference--remained a little longer doubtful. Towards the end of Jane's\nsecond song, her voice grew thick.\n\n“That will do,” said he, when it was finished, thinking aloud--“you have\nsung quite enough for one evening--now be quiet.”\n\nAnother song, however, was soon begged for. “One more;--they would not\nfatigue Miss Fairfax on any account, and would only ask for one more.”\n And Frank Churchill was heard to say, “I think you could manage this\nwithout effort; the first part is so very trifling. The strength of the\nsong falls on the second.”\n\nMr. Knightley grew angry.\n\n“That fellow,” said he, indignantly, “thinks of nothing but shewing off\nhis own voice. This must not be.” And touching Miss Bates, who at that\nmoment passed near--“Miss Bates, are you mad, to let your niece sing\nherself hoarse in this manner? Go, and interfere. They have no mercy on\nher.”\n\nMiss Bates, in her real anxiety for Jane, could hardly stay even to\nbe grateful, before she stept forward and put an end to all farther\nsinging. Here ceased the concert part of the evening, for Miss Woodhouse\nand Miss Fairfax were the only young lady performers; but soon (within\nfive minutes) the proposal of dancing--originating nobody exactly knew\nwhere--was so effectually promoted by Mr. and Mrs. Cole, that every\nthing was rapidly clearing away, to give proper space. Mrs. Weston,\ncapital in her country-dances, was seated, and beginning an irresistible\nwaltz; and Frank Churchill, coming up with most becoming gallantry to\nEmma, had secured her hand, and led her up to the top.\n\nWhile waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off,\nEmma found time, in spite of the compliments she was receiving on\nher voice and her taste, to look about, and see what became of Mr.\nKnightley. This would be a trial. He was no dancer in general. If he\nwere to be very alert in engaging Jane Fairfax now, it might augur\nsomething. There was no immediate appearance. No; he was talking to Mrs.\nCole--he was looking on unconcerned; Jane was asked by somebody else,\nand he was still talking to Mrs. Cole.\n\nEmma had no longer an alarm for Henry; his interest was yet safe; and\nshe led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment. Not more than\nfive couple could be mustered; but the rarity and the suddenness of\nit made it very delightful, and she found herself well matched in a\npartner. They were a couple worth looking at.\n\nTwo dances, unfortunately, were all that could be allowed. It was\ngrowing late, and Miss Bates became anxious to get home, on her mother's\naccount. After some attempts, therefore, to be permitted to begin again,\nthey were obliged to thank Mrs. Weston, look sorrowful, and have done.\n\n“Perhaps it is as well,” said Frank Churchill, as he attended Emma to\nher carriage. “I must have asked Miss Fairfax, and her languid dancing\nwould not have agreed with me, after yours.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nEmma did not repent her condescension in going to the Coles. The visit\nafforded her many pleasant recollections the next day; and all that she\nmight be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion, must\nbe amply repaid in the splendour of popularity. She must have delighted\nthe Coles--worthy people, who deserved to be made happy!--And left a\nname behind her that would not soon die away.\n\nPerfect happiness, even in memory, is not common; and there were two\npoints on which she was not quite easy. She doubted whether she had not\ntransgressed the duty of woman by woman, in betraying her suspicions of\nJane Fairfax's feelings to Frank Churchill. It was hardly right; but it\nhad been so strong an idea, that it would escape her, and his submission\nto all that she told, was a compliment to her penetration, which made\nit difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her\ntongue.\n\nThe other circumstance of regret related also to Jane Fairfax; and\nthere she had no doubt. She did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret the\ninferiority of her own playing and singing. She did most heartily\ngrieve over the idleness of her childhood--and sat down and practised\nvigorously an hour and a half.\n\nShe was then interrupted by Harriet's coming in; and if Harriet's praise\ncould have satisfied her, she might soon have been comforted.\n\n“Oh! if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax!”\n\n“Don't class us together, Harriet. My playing is no more like her's,\nthan a lamp is like sunshine.”\n\n“Oh! dear--I think you play the best of the two. I think you play quite\nas well as she does. I am sure I had much rather hear you. Every body\nlast night said how well you played.”\n\n“Those who knew any thing about it, must have felt the difference. The\ntruth is, Harriet, that my playing is just good enough to be praised,\nbut Jane Fairfax's is much beyond it.”\n\n“Well, I always shall think that you play quite as well as she does, or\nthat if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out. Mr. Cole\nsaid how much taste you had; and Mr. Frank Churchill talked a great deal\nabout your taste, and that he valued taste much more than execution.”\n\n“Ah! but Jane Fairfax has them both, Harriet.”\n\n“Are you sure? I saw she had execution, but I did not know she had any\ntaste. Nobody talked about it. And I hate Italian singing.--There is no\nunderstanding a word of it. Besides, if she does play so very well, you\nknow, it is no more than she is obliged to do, because she will have to\nteach. The Coxes were wondering last night whether she would get into\nany great family. How did you think the Coxes looked?”\n\n“Just as they always do--very vulgar.”\n\n“They told me something,” said Harriet rather hesitatingly; “but it is\nnothing of any consequence.”\n\nEmma was obliged to ask what they had told her, though fearful of its\nproducing Mr. Elton.\n\n“They told me--that Mr. Martin dined with them last Saturday.”\n\n“Oh!”\n\n“He came to their father upon some business, and he asked him to stay to\ndinner.”\n\n“Oh!”\n\n“They talked a great deal about him, especially Anne Cox. I do not know\nwhat she meant, but she asked me if I thought I should go and stay there\nagain next summer.”\n\n“She meant to be impertinently curious, just as such an Anne Cox should\nbe.”\n\n“She said he was very agreeable the day he dined there. He sat by her at\ndinner. Miss Nash thinks either of the Coxes would be very glad to marry\nhim.”\n\n“Very likely.--I think they are, without exception, the most vulgar\ngirls in Highbury.”\n\nHarriet had business at Ford's.--Emma thought it most prudent to go with\nher. Another accidental meeting with the Martins was possible, and in\nher present state, would be dangerous.\n\nHarriet, tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word, was always\nvery long at a purchase; and while she was still hanging over muslins\nand changing her mind, Emma went to the door for amusement.--Much could\nnot be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of Highbury;--Mr.\nPerry walking hastily by, Mr. William Cox letting himself in at the\noffice-door, Mr. Cole's carriage-horses returning from exercise, or a\nstray letter-boy on an obstinate mule, were the liveliest objects she\ncould presume to expect; and when her eyes fell only on the butcher with\nhis tray, a tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her full\nbasket, two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone, and a string of dawdling\nchildren round the baker's little bow-window eyeing the gingerbread, she\nknew she had no reason to complain, and was amused enough; quite enough\nstill to stand at the door. A mind lively and at ease, can do with\nseeing nothing, and can see nothing that does not answer.\n\nShe looked down the Randalls road. The scene enlarged; two persons\nappeared; Mrs. Weston and her son-in-law; they were walking into\nHighbury;--to Hartfield of course. They were stopping, however, in the\nfirst place at Mrs. Bates's; whose house was a little nearer\nRandalls than Ford's; and had all but knocked, when Emma caught their\neye.--Immediately they crossed the road and came forward to her; and the\nagreeableness of yesterday's engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to\nthe present meeting. Mrs. Weston informed her that she was going to call\non the Bateses, in order to hear the new instrument.\n\n“For my companion tells me,” said she, “that I absolutely promised Miss\nBates last night, that I would come this morning. I was not aware of it\nmyself. I did not know that I had fixed a day, but as he says I did, I\nam going now.”\n\n“And while Mrs. Weston pays her visit, I may be allowed, I hope,” said\nFrank Churchill, “to join your party and wait for her at Hartfield--if\nyou are going home.”\n\nMrs. Weston was disappointed.\n\n“I thought you meant to go with me. They would be very much pleased.”\n\n“Me! I should be quite in the way. But, perhaps--I may be equally in the\nway here. Miss Woodhouse looks as if she did not want me. My aunt always\nsends me off when she is shopping. She says I fidget her to death; and\nMiss Woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same. What am I to\ndo?”\n\n“I am here on no business of my own,” said Emma; “I am only waiting for\nmy friend. She will probably have soon done, and then we shall go home.\nBut you had better go with Mrs. Weston and hear the instrument.”\n\n“Well--if you advise it.--But (with a smile) if Colonel Campbell should\nhave employed a careless friend, and if it should prove to have an\nindifferent tone--what shall I say? I shall be no support to Mrs.\nWeston. She might do very well by herself. A disagreeable truth would be\npalatable through her lips, but I am the wretchedest being in the world\nat a civil falsehood.”\n\n“I do not believe any such thing,” replied Emma.--“I am persuaded that\nyou can be as insincere as your neighbours, when it is necessary; but\nthere is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent. Quite\notherwise indeed, if I understood Miss Fairfax's opinion last night.”\n\n“Do come with me,” said Mrs. Weston, “if it be not very disagreeable to\nyou. It need not detain us long. We will go to Hartfield afterwards.\nWe will follow them to Hartfield. I really wish you to call with me. It\nwill be felt so great an attention! and I always thought you meant it.”\n\nHe could say no more; and with the hope of Hartfield to reward him,\nreturned with Mrs. Weston to Mrs. Bates's door. Emma watched them in,\nand then joined Harriet at the interesting counter,--trying, with all\nthe force of her own mind, to convince her that if she wanted plain\nmuslin it was of no use to look at figured; and that a blue ribbon, be\nit ever so beautiful, would still never match her yellow pattern. At\nlast it was all settled, even to the destination of the parcel.\n\n“Should I send it to Mrs. Goddard's, ma'am?” asked Mrs.\nFord.--“Yes--no--yes, to Mrs. Goddard's. Only my pattern gown is at\nHartfield. No, you shall send it to Hartfield, if you please. But then,\nMrs. Goddard will want to see it.--And I could take the pattern gown\nhome any day. But I shall want the ribbon directly--so it had better go\nto Hartfield--at least the ribbon. You could make it into two parcels,\nMrs. Ford, could not you?”\n\n“It is not worth while, Harriet, to give Mrs. Ford the trouble of two\nparcels.”\n\n“No more it is.”\n\n“No trouble in the world, ma'am,” said the obliging Mrs. Ford.\n\n“Oh! but indeed I would much rather have it only in one. Then, if you\nplease, you shall send it all to Mrs. Goddard's--I do not know--No, I\nthink, Miss Woodhouse, I may just as well have it sent to Hartfield, and\ntake it home with me at night. What do you advise?”\n\n“That you do not give another half-second to the subject. To Hartfield,\nif you please, Mrs. Ford.”\n\n“Aye, that will be much best,” said Harriet, quite satisfied, “I should\nnot at all like to have it sent to Mrs. Goddard's.”\n\nVoices approached the shop--or rather one voice and two ladies: Mrs.\nWeston and Miss Bates met them at the door.\n\n“My dear Miss Woodhouse,” said the latter, “I am just run across to\nentreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while,\nand give us your opinion of our new instrument; you and Miss Smith. How\ndo you do, Miss Smith?--Very well I thank you.--And I begged Mrs. Weston\nto come with me, that I might be sure of succeeding.”\n\n“I hope Mrs. Bates and Miss Fairfax are--”\n\n“Very well, I am much obliged to you. My mother is delightfully well;\nand Jane caught no cold last night. How is Mr. Woodhouse?--I am so glad\nto hear such a good account. Mrs. Weston told me you were here.--Oh!\nthen, said I, I must run across, I am sure Miss Woodhouse will allow me\njust to run across and entreat her to come in; my mother will be so\nvery happy to see her--and now we are such a nice party, she cannot\nrefuse.--'Aye, pray do,' said Mr. Frank Churchill, 'Miss Woodhouse's\nopinion of the instrument will be worth having.'--But, said I, I shall\nbe more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me.--'Oh,' said\nhe, 'wait half a minute, till I have finished my job;'--For, would you\nbelieve it, Miss Woodhouse, there he is, in the most obliging manner in\nthe world, fastening in the rivet of my mother's spectacles.--The rivet\ncame out, you know, this morning.--So very obliging!--For my mother had\nno use of her spectacles--could not put them on. And, by the bye, every\nbody ought to have two pair of spectacles; they should indeed. Jane said\nso. I meant to take them over to John Saunders the first thing I did,\nbut something or other hindered me all the morning; first one thing,\nthen another, there is no saying what, you know. At one time Patty came\nto say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping. Oh, said I,\nPatty do not come with your bad news to me. Here is the rivet of your\nmistress's spectacles out. Then the baked apples came home, Mrs. Wallis\nsent them by her boy; they are extremely civil and obliging to us, the\nWallises, always--I have heard some people say that Mrs. Wallis can be\nuncivil and give a very rude answer, but we have never known any thing\nbut the greatest attention from them. And it cannot be for the value\nof our custom now, for what is our consumption of bread, you know?\nOnly three of us.--besides dear Jane at present--and she really eats\nnothing--makes such a shocking breakfast, you would be quite frightened\nif you saw it. I dare not let my mother know how little she eats--so I\nsay one thing and then I say another, and it passes off. But about the\nmiddle of the day she gets hungry, and there is nothing she likes so\nwell as these baked apples, and they are extremely wholesome, for I took\nthe opportunity the other day of asking Mr. Perry; I happened to meet\nhim in the street. Not that I had any doubt before--I have so often\nheard Mr. Woodhouse recommend a baked apple. I believe it is the only\nway that Mr. Woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome. We\nhave apple-dumplings, however, very often. Patty makes an excellent\napple-dumpling. Well, Mrs. Weston, you have prevailed, I hope, and these\nladies will oblige us.”\n\nEmma would be “very happy to wait on Mrs. Bates, &c.,” and they did at\nlast move out of the shop, with no farther delay from Miss Bates than,\n\n“How do you do, Mrs. Ford? I beg your pardon. I did not see you before.\nI hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town. Jane\ncame back delighted yesterday. Thank ye, the gloves do very well--only a\nlittle too large about the wrist; but Jane is taking them in.”\n\n“What was I talking of?” said she, beginning again when they were all in\nthe street.\n\nEmma wondered on what, of all the medley, she would fix.\n\n“I declare I cannot recollect what I was talking of.--Oh! my mother's\nspectacles. So very obliging of Mr. Frank Churchill! 'Oh!' said he,\n'I do think I can fasten the rivet; I like a job of this kind\nexcessively.'--Which you know shewed him to be so very.... Indeed I must\nsay that, much as I had heard of him before and much as I had expected,\nhe very far exceeds any thing.... I do congratulate you, Mrs. Weston,\nmost warmly. He seems every thing the fondest parent could....\n'Oh!' said he, 'I can fasten the rivet. I like a job of that sort\nexcessively.' I never shall forget his manner. And when I brought out\nthe baked apples from the closet, and hoped our friends would be so very\nobliging as to take some, 'Oh!' said he directly, 'there is nothing\nin the way of fruit half so good, and these are the finest-looking\nhome-baked apples I ever saw in my life.' That, you know, was so\nvery.... And I am sure, by his manner, it was no compliment. Indeed they\nare very delightful apples, and Mrs. Wallis does them full justice--only\nwe do not have them baked more than twice, and Mr. Woodhouse made us\npromise to have them done three times--but Miss Woodhouse will be so\ngood as not to mention it. The apples themselves are the very finest\nsort for baking, beyond a doubt; all from Donwell--some of Mr.\nKnightley's most liberal supply. He sends us a sack every year; and\ncertainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his\ntrees--I believe there is two of them. My mother says the orchard was\nalways famous in her younger days. But I was really quite shocked the\nother day--for Mr. Knightley called one morning, and Jane was eating\nthese apples, and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed\nthem, and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock. 'I\nam sure you must be,' said he, 'and I will send you another supply; for\nI have a great many more than I can ever use. William Larkins let me\nkeep a larger quantity than usual this year. I will send you some more,\nbefore they get good for nothing.' So I begged he would not--for really\nas to ours being gone, I could not absolutely say that we had a great\nmany left--it was but half a dozen indeed; but they should be all kept\nfor Jane; and I could not at all bear that he should be sending us more,\nso liberal as he had been already; and Jane said the same. And when\nhe was gone, she almost quarrelled with me--No, I should not say\nquarrelled, for we never had a quarrel in our lives; but she was quite\ndistressed that I had owned the apples were so nearly gone; she wished\nI had made him believe we had a great many left. Oh, said I, my dear,\nI did say as much as I could. However, the very same evening William\nLarkins came over with a large basket of apples, the same sort of\napples, a bushel at least, and I was very much obliged, and went down\nand spoke to William Larkins and said every thing, as you may suppose.\nWilliam Larkins is such an old acquaintance! I am always glad to see\nhim. But, however, I found afterwards from Patty, that William said it\nwas all the apples of _that_ sort his master had; he had brought them\nall--and now his master had not one left to bake or boil. William did\nnot seem to mind it himself, he was so pleased to think his master had\nsold so many; for William, you know, thinks more of his master's profit\nthan any thing; but Mrs. Hodges, he said, was quite displeased at their\nbeing all sent away. She could not bear that her master should not be\nable to have another apple-tart this spring. He told Patty this, but bid\nher not mind it, and be sure not to say any thing to us about it, for\nMrs. Hodges _would_ be cross sometimes, and as long as so many sacks\nwere sold, it did not signify who ate the remainder. And so Patty told\nme, and I was excessively shocked indeed! I would not have Mr. Knightley\nknow any thing about it for the world! He would be so very.... I wanted\nto keep it from Jane's knowledge; but, unluckily, I had mentioned it\nbefore I was aware.”\n\nMiss Bates had just done as Patty opened the door; and her visitors\nwalked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to,\npursued only by the sounds of her desultory good-will.\n\n“Pray take care, Mrs. Weston, there is a step at the turning. Pray take\ncare, Miss Woodhouse, ours is rather a dark staircase--rather darker\nand narrower than one could wish. Miss Smith, pray take care. Miss\nWoodhouse, I am quite concerned, I am sure you hit your foot. Miss\nSmith, the step at the turning.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\nThe appearance of the little sitting-room as they entered, was\ntranquillity itself; Mrs. Bates, deprived of her usual employment,\nslumbering on one side of the fire, Frank Churchill, at a table near\nher, most deedily occupied about her spectacles, and Jane Fairfax,\nstanding with her back to them, intent on her pianoforte.\n\nBusy as he was, however, the young man was yet able to shew a most happy\ncountenance on seeing Emma again.\n\n“This is a pleasure,” said he, in rather a low voice, “coming at least\nten minutes earlier than I had calculated. You find me trying to be\nuseful; tell me if you think I shall succeed.”\n\n“What!” said Mrs. Weston, “have not you finished it yet? you would not\nearn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate.”\n\n“I have not been working uninterruptedly,” he replied, “I have been\nassisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily,\nit was not quite firm; an unevenness in the floor, I believe. You see\nwe have been wedging one leg with paper. This was very kind of you to be\npersuaded to come. I was almost afraid you would be hurrying home.”\n\nHe contrived that she should be seated by him; and was sufficiently\nemployed in looking out the best baked apple for her, and trying to make\nher help or advise him in his work, till Jane Fairfax was quite ready\nto sit down to the pianoforte again. That she was not immediately ready,\nEmma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves; she had not yet\npossessed the instrument long enough to touch it without emotion; she\nmust reason herself into the power of performance; and Emma could not\nbut pity such feelings, whatever their origin, and could not but resolve\nnever to expose them to her neighbour again.\n\nAt last Jane began, and though the first bars were feebly given, the\npowers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to. Mrs.\nWeston had been delighted before, and was delighted again; Emma\njoined her in all her praise; and the pianoforte, with every proper\ndiscrimination, was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise.\n\n“Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ,” said Frank Churchill, with a\nsmile at Emma, “the person has not chosen ill. I heard a good deal of\nColonel Campbell's taste at Weymouth; and the softness of the upper\nnotes I am sure is exactly what he and _all_ _that_ _party_ would\nparticularly prize. I dare say, Miss Fairfax, that he either gave his\nfriend very minute directions, or wrote to Broadwood himself. Do not you\nthink so?”\n\nJane did not look round. She was not obliged to hear. Mrs. Weston had\nbeen speaking to her at the same moment.\n\n“It is not fair,” said Emma, in a whisper; “mine was a random guess. Do\nnot distress her.”\n\nHe shook his head with a smile, and looked as if he had very little\ndoubt and very little mercy. Soon afterwards he began again,\n\n“How much your friends in Ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on this\noccasion, Miss Fairfax. I dare say they often think of you, and wonder\nwhich will be the day, the precise day of the instrument's coming to\nhand. Do you imagine Colonel Campbell knows the business to be going\nforward just at this time?--Do you imagine it to be the consequence\nof an immediate commission from him, or that he may have sent only\na general direction, an order indefinite as to time, to depend upon\ncontingencies and conveniences?”\n\nHe paused. She could not but hear; she could not avoid answering,\n\n“Till I have a letter from Colonel Campbell,” said she, in a voice of\nforced calmness, “I can imagine nothing with any confidence. It must be\nall conjecture.”\n\n“Conjecture--aye, sometimes one conjectures right, and sometimes one\nconjectures wrong. I wish I could conjecture how soon I shall make this\nrivet quite firm. What nonsense one talks, Miss Woodhouse, when hard\nat work, if one talks at all;--your real workmen, I suppose, hold their\ntongues; but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a word--Miss\nFairfax said something about conjecturing. There, it is done. I have the\npleasure, madam, (to Mrs. Bates,) of restoring your spectacles, healed\nfor the present.”\n\nHe was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter; to escape a\nlittle from the latter, he went to the pianoforte, and begged Miss\nFairfax, who was still sitting at it, to play something more.\n\n“If you are very kind,” said he, “it will be one of the waltzes we\ndanced last night;--let me live them over again. You did not enjoy them\nas I did; you appeared tired the whole time. I believe you were glad we\ndanced no longer; but I would have given worlds--all the worlds one ever\nhas to give--for another half-hour.”\n\nShe played.\n\n“What felicity it is to hear a tune again which _has_ made one\nhappy!--If I mistake not that was danced at Weymouth.”\n\nShe looked up at him for a moment, coloured deeply, and played something\nelse. He took some music from a chair near the pianoforte, and turning\nto Emma, said,\n\n“Here is something quite new to me. Do you know it?--Cramer.--And here\nare a new set of Irish melodies. That, from such a quarter, one might\nexpect. This was all sent with the instrument. Very thoughtful of\nColonel Campbell, was not it?--He knew Miss Fairfax could have no music\nhere. I honour that part of the attention particularly; it shews it to\nhave been so thoroughly from the heart. Nothing hastily done; nothing\nincomplete. True affection only could have prompted it.”\n\nEmma wished he would be less pointed, yet could not help being amused;\nand when on glancing her eye towards Jane Fairfax she caught the remains\nof a smile, when she saw that with all the deep blush of consciousness,\nthere had been a smile of secret delight, she had less scruple in the\namusement, and much less compunction with respect to her.--This\namiable, upright, perfect Jane Fairfax was apparently cherishing very\nreprehensible feelings.\n\nHe brought all the music to her, and they looked it over together.--Emma\ntook the opportunity of whispering,\n\n“You speak too plain. She must understand you.”\n\n“I hope she does. I would have her understand me. I am not in the least\nashamed of my meaning.”\n\n“But really, I am half ashamed, and wish I had never taken up the idea.”\n\n“I am very glad you did, and that you communicated it to me. I have now\na key to all her odd looks and ways. Leave shame to her. If she does\nwrong, she ought to feel it.”\n\n“She is not entirely without it, I think.”\n\n“I do not see much sign of it. She is playing _Robin_ _Adair_ at this\nmoment--_his_ favourite.”\n\nShortly afterwards Miss Bates, passing near the window, descried Mr.\nKnightley on horse-back not far off.\n\n“Mr. Knightley I declare!--I must speak to him if possible, just to\nthank him. I will not open the window here; it would give you all cold;\nbut I can go into my mother's room you know. I dare say he will come\nin when he knows who is here. Quite delightful to have you all meet\nso!--Our little room so honoured!”\n\nShe was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke, and opening the\ncasement there, immediately called Mr. Knightley's attention, and every\nsyllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by the others, as\nif it had passed within the same apartment.\n\n“How d' ye do?--how d'ye do?--Very well, I thank you. So obliged to you\nfor the carriage last night. We were just in time; my mother just ready\nfor us. Pray come in; do come in. You will find some friends here.”\n\nSo began Miss Bates; and Mr. Knightley seemed determined to be heard in\nhis turn, for most resolutely and commandingly did he say,\n\n“How is your niece, Miss Bates?--I want to inquire after you all, but\nparticularly your niece. How is Miss Fairfax?--I hope she caught no cold\nlast night. How is she to-day? Tell me how Miss Fairfax is.”\n\nAnd Miss Bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he would hear\nher in any thing else. The listeners were amused; and Mrs. Weston gave\nEmma a look of particular meaning. But Emma still shook her head in\nsteady scepticism.\n\n“So obliged to you!--so very much obliged to you for the carriage,”\n resumed Miss Bates.\n\nHe cut her short with,\n\n“I am going to Kingston. Can I do any thing for you?”\n\n“Oh! dear, Kingston--are you?--Mrs. Cole was saying the other day she\nwanted something from Kingston.”\n\n“Mrs. Cole has servants to send. Can I do any thing for _you_?”\n\n“No, I thank you. But do come in. Who do you think is here?--Miss\nWoodhouse and Miss Smith; so kind as to call to hear the new pianoforte.\nDo put up your horse at the Crown, and come in.”\n\n“Well,” said he, in a deliberating manner, “for five minutes, perhaps.”\n\n“And here is Mrs. Weston and Mr. Frank Churchill too!--Quite delightful;\nso many friends!”\n\n“No, not now, I thank you. I could not stay two minutes. I must get on\nto Kingston as fast as I can.”\n\n“Oh! do come in. They will be so very happy to see you.”\n\n“No, no; your room is full enough. I will call another day, and hear the\npianoforte.”\n\n“Well, I am so sorry!--Oh! Mr. Knightley, what a delightful party last\nnight; how extremely pleasant.--Did you ever see such dancing?--Was not\nit delightful?--Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill; I never saw any\nthing equal to it.”\n\n“Oh! very delightful indeed; I can say nothing less, for I suppose Miss\nWoodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill are hearing every thing that passes.\nAnd (raising his voice still more) I do not see why Miss Fairfax should\nnot be mentioned too. I think Miss Fairfax dances very well; and Mrs.\nWeston is the very best country-dance player, without exception,\nin England. Now, if your friends have any gratitude, they will say\nsomething pretty loud about you and me in return; but I cannot stay to\nhear it.”\n\n“Oh! Mr. Knightley, one moment more; something of consequence--so\nshocked!--Jane and I are both so shocked about the apples!”\n\n“What is the matter now?”\n\n“To think of your sending us all your store apples. You said you had\na great many, and now you have not one left. We really are so shocked!\nMrs. Hodges may well be angry. William Larkins mentioned it here. You\nshould not have done it, indeed you should not. Ah! he is off. He never\ncan bear to be thanked. But I thought he would have staid now, and it\nwould have been a pity not to have mentioned.... Well, (returning to the\nroom,) I have not been able to succeed. Mr. Knightley cannot stop. He is\ngoing to Kingston. He asked me if he could do any thing....”\n\n“Yes,” said Jane, “we heard his kind offers, we heard every thing.”\n\n“Oh! yes, my dear, I dare say you might, because you know, the door was\nopen, and the window was open, and Mr. Knightley spoke loud. You must\nhave heard every thing to be sure. 'Can I do any thing for you at\nKingston?' said he; so I just mentioned.... Oh! Miss Woodhouse, must you\nbe going?--You seem but just come--so very obliging of you.”\n\nEmma found it really time to be at home; the visit had already lasted\nlong; and on examining watches, so much of the morning was perceived\nto be gone, that Mrs. Weston and her companion taking leave also, could\nallow themselves only to walk with the two young ladies to Hartfield\ngates, before they set off for Randalls.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\nIt may be possible to do without dancing entirely. Instances have been\nknown of young people passing many, many months successively, without\nbeing at any ball of any description, and no material injury accrue\neither to body or mind;--but when a beginning is made--when the\nfelicities of rapid motion have once been, though slightly, felt--it\nmust be a very heavy set that does not ask for more.\n\nFrank Churchill had danced once at Highbury, and longed to dance again;\nand the last half-hour of an evening which Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded\nto spend with his daughter at Randalls, was passed by the two young\npeople in schemes on the subject. Frank's was the first idea; and his\nthe greatest zeal in pursuing it; for the lady was the best judge of the\ndifficulties, and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance.\nBut still she had inclination enough for shewing people again how\ndelightfully Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse danced--for\ndoing that in which she need not blush to compare herself with Jane\nFairfax--and even for simple dancing itself, without any of the wicked\naids of vanity--to assist him first in pacing out the room they were in\nto see what it could be made to hold--and then in taking the dimensions\nof the other parlour, in the hope of discovering, in spite of all that\nMr. Weston could say of their exactly equal size, that it was a little\nthe largest.\n\nHis first proposition and request, that the dance begun at Mr. Cole's\nshould be finished there--that the same party should be collected,\nand the same musician engaged, met with the readiest acquiescence. Mr.\nWeston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment, and Mrs. Weston\nmost willingly undertook to play as long as they could wish to dance;\nand the interesting employment had followed, of reckoning up exactly who\nthere would be, and portioning out the indispensable division of space\nto every couple.\n\n“You and Miss Smith, and Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss\nCoxes five,” had been repeated many times over. “And there will be the\ntwo Gilberts, young Cox, my father, and myself, besides Mr. Knightley.\nYes, that will be quite enough for pleasure. You and Miss Smith, and\nMiss Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss Coxes five; and for five\ncouple there will be plenty of room.”\n\nBut soon it came to be on one side,\n\n“But will there be good room for five couple?--I really do not think\nthere will.”\n\nOn another,\n\n“And after all, five couple are not enough to make it worth while to\nstand up. Five couple are nothing, when one thinks seriously about it.\nIt will not do to _invite_ five couple. It can be allowable only as the\nthought of the moment.”\n\nSomebody said that _Miss_ Gilbert was expected at her brother's, and\nmust be invited with the rest. Somebody else believed _Mrs_. Gilbert\nwould have danced the other evening, if she had been asked. A word was\nput in for a second young Cox; and at last, Mr. Weston naming one family\nof cousins who must be included, and another of very old acquaintance\nwho could not be left out, it became a certainty that the five couple\nwould be at least ten, and a very interesting speculation in what\npossible manner they could be disposed of.\n\nThe doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other. “Might not\nthey use both rooms, and dance across the passage?” It seemed the\nbest scheme; and yet it was not so good but that many of them wanted a\nbetter. Emma said it would be awkward; Mrs. Weston was in distress about\nthe supper; and Mr. Woodhouse opposed it earnestly, on the score of\nhealth. It made him so very unhappy, indeed, that it could not be\npersevered in.\n\n“Oh! no,” said he; “it would be the extreme of imprudence. I could not\nbear it for Emma!--Emma is not strong. She would catch a dreadful cold.\nSo would poor little Harriet. So you would all. Mrs. Weston, you would\nbe quite laid up; do not let them talk of such a wild thing. Pray do\nnot let them talk of it. That young man (speaking lower) is very\nthoughtless. Do not tell his father, but that young man is not quite\nthe thing. He has been opening the doors very often this evening,\nand keeping them open very inconsiderately. He does not think of the\ndraught. I do not mean to set you against him, but indeed he is not\nquite the thing!”\n\nMrs. Weston was sorry for such a charge. She knew the importance of\nit, and said every thing in her power to do it away. Every door was now\nclosed, the passage plan given up, and the first scheme of dancing only\nin the room they were in resorted to again; and with such good-will on\nFrank Churchill's part, that the space which a quarter of an hour before\nhad been deemed barely sufficient for five couple, was now endeavoured\nto be made out quite enough for ten.\n\n“We were too magnificent,” said he. “We allowed unnecessary room. Ten\ncouple may stand here very well.”\n\nEmma demurred. “It would be a crowd--a sad crowd; and what could be\nworse than dancing without space to turn in?”\n\n“Very true,” he gravely replied; “it was very bad.” But still he went on\nmeasuring, and still he ended with,\n\n“I think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple.”\n\n“No, no,” said she, “you are quite unreasonable. It would be dreadful\nto be standing so close! Nothing can be farther from pleasure than to be\ndancing in a crowd--and a crowd in a little room!”\n\n“There is no denying it,” he replied. “I agree with you exactly. A crowd\nin a little room--Miss Woodhouse, you have the art of giving pictures\nin a few words. Exquisite, quite exquisite!--Still, however, having\nproceeded so far, one is unwilling to give the matter up. It would be\na disappointment to my father--and altogether--I do not know that--I am\nrather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well.”\n\nEmma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little\nself-willed, and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure of\ndancing with her; but she took the compliment, and forgave the rest.\nHad she intended ever to _marry_ him, it might have been worth while to\npause and consider, and try to understand the value of his preference,\nand the character of his temper; but for all the purposes of their\nacquaintance, he was quite amiable enough.\n\nBefore the middle of the next day, he was at Hartfield; and he entered\nthe room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance of\nthe scheme. It soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement.\n\n“Well, Miss Woodhouse,” he almost immediately began, “your inclination\nfor dancing has not been quite frightened away, I hope, by the terrors\nof my father's little rooms. I bring a new proposal on the subject:--a\nthought of my father's, which waits only your approbation to be acted\nupon. May I hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances\nof this little projected ball, to be given, not at Randalls, but at the\nCrown Inn?”\n\n“The Crown!”\n\n“Yes; if you and Mr. Woodhouse see no objection, and I trust you cannot,\nmy father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there.\nBetter accommodations, he can promise them, and not a less grateful\nwelcome than at Randalls. It is his own idea. Mrs. Weston sees no\nobjection to it, provided you are satisfied. This is what we all feel.\nOh! you were perfectly right! Ten couple, in either of the Randalls\nrooms, would have been insufferable!--Dreadful!--I felt how right you\nwere the whole time, but was too anxious for securing _any_ _thing_\nto like to yield. Is not it a good exchange?--You consent--I hope you\nconsent?”\n\n“It appears to me a plan that nobody can object to, if Mr. and Mrs.\nWeston do not. I think it admirable; and, as far as I can answer for\nmyself, shall be most happy--It seems the only improvement that could\nbe. Papa, do you not think it an excellent improvement?”\n\nShe was obliged to repeat and explain it, before it was fully\ncomprehended; and then, being quite new, farther representations were\nnecessary to make it acceptable.\n\n“No; he thought it very far from an improvement--a very bad plan--much\nworse than the other. A room at an inn was always damp and dangerous;\nnever properly aired, or fit to be inhabited. If they must dance, they\nhad better dance at Randalls. He had never been in the room at the Crown\nin his life--did not know the people who kept it by sight.--Oh! no--a\nvery bad plan. They would catch worse colds at the Crown than anywhere.”\n\n“I was going to observe, sir,” said Frank Churchill, “that one of the\ngreat recommendations of this change would be the very little danger\nof any body's catching cold--so much less danger at the Crown than at\nRandalls! Mr. Perry might have reason to regret the alteration, but\nnobody else could.”\n\n“Sir,” said Mr. Woodhouse, rather warmly, “you are very much mistaken\nif you suppose Mr. Perry to be that sort of character. Mr. Perry is\nextremely concerned when any of us are ill. But I do not understand how\nthe room at the Crown can be safer for you than your father's house.”\n\n“From the very circumstance of its being larger, sir. We shall have no\noccasion to open the windows at all--not once the whole evening; and it\nis that dreadful habit of opening the windows, letting in cold air upon\nheated bodies, which (as you well know, sir) does the mischief.”\n\n“Open the windows!--but surely, Mr. Churchill, nobody would think of\nopening the windows at Randalls. Nobody could be so imprudent! I never\nheard of such a thing. Dancing with open windows!--I am sure, neither\nyour father nor Mrs. Weston (poor Miss Taylor that was) would suffer\nit.”\n\n“Ah! sir--but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a\nwindow-curtain, and throw up a sash, without its being suspected. I have\noften known it done myself.”\n\n“Have you indeed, sir?--Bless me! I never could have supposed it. But I\nlive out of the world, and am often astonished at what I hear. However,\nthis does make a difference; and, perhaps, when we come to talk it\nover--but these sort of things require a good deal of consideration. One\ncannot resolve upon them in a hurry. If Mr. and Mrs. Weston will be so\nobliging as to call here one morning, we may talk it over, and see what\ncan be done.”\n\n“But, unfortunately, sir, my time is so limited--”\n\n“Oh!” interrupted Emma, “there will be plenty of time for talking every\nthing over. There is no hurry at all. If it can be contrived to be at\nthe Crown, papa, it will be very convenient for the horses. They will be\nso near their own stable.”\n\n“So they will, my dear. That is a great thing. Not that James ever\ncomplains; but it is right to spare our horses when we can. If I could\nbe sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired--but is Mrs. Stokes to be\ntrusted? I doubt it. I do not know her, even by sight.”\n\n“I can answer for every thing of that nature, sir, because it will be\nunder Mrs. Weston's care. Mrs. Weston undertakes to direct the whole.”\n\n“There, papa!--Now you must be satisfied--Our own dear Mrs. Weston, who\nis carefulness itself. Do not you remember what Mr. Perry said, so many\nyears ago, when I had the measles? 'If _Miss_ _Taylor_ undertakes to\nwrap Miss Emma up, you need not have any fears, sir.' How often have I\nheard you speak of it as such a compliment to her!”\n\n“Aye, very true. Mr. Perry did say so. I shall never forget it. Poor\nlittle Emma! You were very bad with the measles; that is, you would have\nbeen very bad, but for Perry's great attention. He came four times a day\nfor a week. He said, from the first, it was a very good sort--which\nwas our great comfort; but the measles are a dreadful complaint. I hope\nwhenever poor Isabella's little ones have the measles, she will send for\nPerry.”\n\n“My father and Mrs. Weston are at the Crown at this moment,” said Frank\nChurchill, “examining the capabilities of the house. I left them there\nand came on to Hartfield, impatient for your opinion, and hoping you\nmight be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot. I was\ndesired to say so from both. It would be the greatest pleasure to\nthem, if you could allow me to attend you there. They can do nothing\nsatisfactorily without you.”\n\nEmma was most happy to be called to such a council; and her father,\nengaging to think it all over while she was gone, the two young people\nset off together without delay for the Crown. There were Mr. and Mrs.\nWeston; delighted to see her and receive her approbation, very busy and\nvery happy in their different way; she, in some little distress; and he,\nfinding every thing perfect.\n\n“Emma,” said she, “this paper is worse than I expected. Look! in places\nyou see it is dreadfully dirty; and the wainscot is more yellow and\nforlorn than any thing I could have imagined.”\n\n“My dear, you are too particular,” said her husband. “What does all that\nsignify? You will see nothing of it by candlelight. It will be as\nclean as Randalls by candlelight. We never see any thing of it on our\nclub-nights.”\n\nThe ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant, “Men never know\nwhen things are dirty or not;” and the gentlemen perhaps thought each to\nhimself, “Women will have their little nonsenses and needless cares.”\n\nOne perplexity, however, arose, which the gentlemen did not disdain.\nIt regarded a supper-room. At the time of the ballroom's being built,\nsuppers had not been in question; and a small card-room adjoining, was\nthe only addition. What was to be done? This card-room would be wanted\nas a card-room now; or, if cards were conveniently voted unnecessary\nby their four selves, still was it not too small for any comfortable\nsupper? Another room of much better size might be secured for the\npurpose; but it was at the other end of the house, and a long awkward\npassage must be gone through to get at it. This made a difficulty. Mrs.\nWeston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage;\nand neither Emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being\nmiserably crowded at supper.\n\nMrs. Weston proposed having no regular supper; merely sandwiches,\n&c., set out in the little room; but that was scouted as a wretched\nsuggestion. A private dance, without sitting down to supper, was\npronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women; and\nMrs. Weston must not speak of it again. She then took another line of\nexpediency, and looking into the doubtful room, observed,\n\n“I do not think it _is_ so very small. We shall not be many, you know.”\n\nAnd Mr. Weston at the same time, walking briskly with long steps through\nthe passage, was calling out,\n\n“You talk a great deal of the length of this passage, my dear. It is a\nmere nothing after all; and not the least draught from the stairs.”\n\n“I wish,” said Mrs. Weston, “one could know which arrangement our guests\nin general would like best. To do what would be most generally pleasing\nmust be our object--if one could but tell what that would be.”\n\n“Yes, very true,” cried Frank, “very true. You want your neighbours'\nopinions. I do not wonder at you. If one could ascertain what the chief\nof them--the Coles, for instance. They are not far off. Shall I call\nupon them? Or Miss Bates? She is still nearer.--And I do not know\nwhether Miss Bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of\nthe rest of the people as any body. I think we do want a larger council.\nSuppose I go and invite Miss Bates to join us?”\n\n“Well--if you please,” said Mrs. Weston rather hesitating, “if you think\nshe will be of any use.”\n\n“You will get nothing to the purpose from Miss Bates,” said Emma. “She\nwill be all delight and gratitude, but she will tell you nothing. She\nwill not even listen to your questions. I see no advantage in consulting\nMiss Bates.”\n\n“But she is so amusing, so extremely amusing! I am very fond of hearing\nMiss Bates talk. And I need not bring the whole family, you know.”\n\nHere Mr. Weston joined them, and on hearing what was proposed, gave it\nhis decided approbation.\n\n“Aye, do, Frank.--Go and fetch Miss Bates, and let us end the matter at\nonce. She will enjoy the scheme, I am sure; and I do not know a properer\nperson for shewing us how to do away difficulties. Fetch Miss Bates.\nWe are growing a little too nice. She is a standing lesson of how to be\nhappy. But fetch them both. Invite them both.”\n\n“Both sir! Can the old lady?”...\n\n“The old lady! No, the young lady, to be sure. I shall think you a great\nblockhead, Frank, if you bring the aunt without the niece.”\n\n“Oh! I beg your pardon, sir. I did not immediately recollect.\nUndoubtedly if you wish it, I will endeavour to persuade them both.” And\naway he ran.\n\nLong before he reappeared, attending the short, neat, brisk-moving aunt,\nand her elegant niece,--Mrs. Weston, like a sweet-tempered woman and\na good wife, had examined the passage again, and found the evils of it\nmuch less than she had supposed before--indeed very trifling; and here\nended the difficulties of decision. All the rest, in speculation at\nleast, was perfectly smooth. All the minor arrangements of table and\nchair, lights and music, tea and supper, made themselves; or were left\nas mere trifles to be settled at any time between Mrs. Weston and Mrs.\nStokes.--Every body invited, was certainly to come; Frank had already\nwritten to Enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his fortnight,\nwhich could not possibly be refused. And a delightful dance it was to\nbe.\n\nMost cordially, when Miss Bates arrived, did she agree that it must.\nAs a counsellor she was not wanted; but as an approver, (a much safer\ncharacter,) she was truly welcome. Her approbation, at once general\nand minute, warm and incessant, could not but please; and for another\nhalf-hour they were all walking to and fro, between the different rooms,\nsome suggesting, some attending, and all in happy enjoyment of the\nfuture. The party did not break up without Emma's being positively\nsecured for the two first dances by the hero of the evening, nor without\nher overhearing Mr. Weston whisper to his wife, “He has asked her, my\ndear. That's right. I knew he would!”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\nOne thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball completely\nsatisfactory to Emma--its being fixed for a day within the granted\nterm of Frank Churchill's stay in Surry; for, in spite of Mr. Weston's\nconfidence, she could not think it so very impossible that the\nChurchills might not allow their nephew to remain a day beyond his\nfortnight. But this was not judged feasible. The preparations must take\ntheir time, nothing could be properly ready till the third week were\nentered on, and for a few days they must be planning, proceeding and\nhoping in uncertainty--at the risk--in her opinion, the great risk, of\nits being all in vain.\n\nEnscombe however was gracious, gracious in fact, if not in word. His\nwish of staying longer evidently did not please; but it was not opposed.\nAll was safe and prosperous; and as the removal of one solicitude\ngenerally makes way for another, Emma, being now certain of her\nball, began to adopt as the next vexation Mr. Knightley's provoking\nindifference about it. Either because he did not dance himself, or\nbecause the plan had been formed without his being consulted, he\nseemed resolved that it should not interest him, determined against its\nexciting any present curiosity, or affording him any future amusement.\nTo her voluntary communications Emma could get no more approving reply,\nthan,\n\n“Very well. If the Westons think it worth while to be at all this\ntrouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment, I have nothing to say\nagainst it, but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me.--Oh! yes,\nI must be there; I could not refuse; and I will keep as much awake as\nI can; but I would rather be at home, looking over William Larkins's\nweek's account; much rather, I confess.--Pleasure in seeing\ndancing!--not I, indeed--I never look at it--I do not know who\ndoes.--Fine dancing, I believe, like virtue, must be its own reward.\nThose who are standing by are usually thinking of something very\ndifferent.”\n\nThis Emma felt was aimed at her; and it made her quite angry. It was not\nin compliment to Jane Fairfax however that he was so indifferent, or so\nindignant; he was not guided by _her_ feelings in reprobating the ball,\nfor _she_ enjoyed the thought of it to an extraordinary degree. It made\nher animated--open hearted--she voluntarily said;--\n\n“Oh! Miss Woodhouse, I hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball.\nWhat a disappointment it would be! I do look forward to it, I own, with\n_very_ great pleasure.”\n\nIt was not to oblige Jane Fairfax therefore that he would have preferred\nthe society of William Larkins. No!--she was more and more convinced\nthat Mrs. Weston was quite mistaken in that surmise. There was a great\ndeal of friendly and of compassionate attachment on his side--but no\nlove.\n\nAlas! there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with Mr. Knightley. Two\ndays of joyful security were immediately followed by the over-throw of\nevery thing. A letter arrived from Mr. Churchill to urge his nephew's\ninstant return. Mrs. Churchill was unwell--far too unwell to do without\nhim; she had been in a very suffering state (so said her husband)\nwhen writing to her nephew two days before, though from her usual\nunwillingness to give pain, and constant habit of never thinking of\nherself, she had not mentioned it; but now she was too ill to trifle,\nand must entreat him to set off for Enscombe without delay.\n\nThe substance of this letter was forwarded to Emma, in a note from Mrs.\nWeston, instantly. As to his going, it was inevitable. He must be gone\nwithin a few hours, though without feeling any real alarm for his aunt,\nto lessen his repugnance. He knew her illnesses; they never occurred but\nfor her own convenience.\n\nMrs. Weston added, “that he could only allow himself time to hurry to\nHighbury, after breakfast, and take leave of the few friends there\nwhom he could suppose to feel any interest in him; and that he might be\nexpected at Hartfield very soon.”\n\nThis wretched note was the finale of Emma's breakfast. When once it had\nbeen read, there was no doing any thing, but lament and exclaim. The\nloss of the ball--the loss of the young man--and all that the young man\nmight be feeling!--It was too wretched!--Such a delightful evening as\nit would have been!--Every body so happy! and she and her partner the\nhappiest!--“I said it would be so,” was the only consolation.\n\nHer father's feelings were quite distinct. He thought principally of\nMrs. Churchill's illness, and wanted to know how she was treated; and as\nfor the ball, it was shocking to have dear Emma disappointed; but they\nwould all be safer at home.\n\nEmma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared; but if this\nreflected at all upon his impatience, his sorrowful look and total want\nof spirits when he did come might redeem him. He felt the going away\nalmost too much to speak of it. His dejection was most evident. He\nsat really lost in thought for the first few minutes; and when rousing\nhimself, it was only to say,\n\n“Of all horrid things, leave-taking is the worst.”\n\n“But you will come again,” said Emma. “This will not be your only visit\nto Randalls.”\n\n“Ah!--(shaking his head)--the uncertainty of when I may be able to\nreturn!--I shall try for it with a zeal!--It will be the object of\nall my thoughts and cares!--and if my uncle and aunt go to town this\nspring--but I am afraid--they did not stir last spring--I am afraid it\nis a custom gone for ever.”\n\n“Our poor ball must be quite given up.”\n\n“Ah! that ball!--why did we wait for any thing?--why not seize the\npleasure at once?--How often is happiness destroyed by preparation,\nfoolish preparation!--You told us it would be so.--Oh! Miss Woodhouse,\nwhy are you always so right?”\n\n“Indeed, I am very sorry to be right in this instance. I would much\nrather have been merry than wise.”\n\n“If I can come again, we are still to have our ball. My father depends\non it. Do not forget your engagement.”\n\nEmma looked graciously.\n\n“Such a fortnight as it has been!” he continued; “every day more\nprecious and more delightful than the day before!--every day making\nme less fit to bear any other place. Happy those, who can remain at\nHighbury!”\n\n“As you do us such ample justice now,” said Emma, laughing, “I will\nventure to ask, whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first?\nDo not we rather surpass your expectations? I am sure we do. I am sure\nyou did not much expect to like us. You would not have been so long in\ncoming, if you had had a pleasant idea of Highbury.”\n\nHe laughed rather consciously; and though denying the sentiment, Emma\nwas convinced that it had been so.\n\n“And you must be off this very morning?”\n\n“Yes; my father is to join me here: we shall walk back together, and I\nmust be off immediately. I am almost afraid that every moment will bring\nhim.”\n\n“Not five minutes to spare even for your friends Miss Fairfax and Miss\nBates? How unlucky! Miss Bates's powerful, argumentative mind might have\nstrengthened yours.”\n\n“Yes--I _have_ called there; passing the door, I thought it better. It\nwas a right thing to do. I went in for three minutes, and was detained\nby Miss Bates's being absent. She was out; and I felt it impossible not\nto wait till she came in. She is a woman that one may, that one _must_\nlaugh at; but that one would not wish to slight. It was better to pay my\nvisit, then”--\n\nHe hesitated, got up, walked to a window.\n\n“In short,” said he, “perhaps, Miss Woodhouse--I think you can hardly be\nquite without suspicion”--\n\nHe looked at her, as if wanting to read her thoughts. She hardly knew\nwhat to say. It seemed like the forerunner of something absolutely\nserious, which she did not wish. Forcing herself to speak, therefore, in\nthe hope of putting it by, she calmly said,\n\n“You are quite in the right; it was most natural to pay your visit,\nthen”--\n\nHe was silent. She believed he was looking at her; probably reflecting\non what she had said, and trying to understand the manner. She heard\nhim sigh. It was natural for him to feel that he had _cause_ to sigh.\nHe could not believe her to be encouraging him. A few awkward moments\npassed, and he sat down again; and in a more determined manner said,\n\n“It was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given to\nHartfield. My regard for Hartfield is most warm”--\n\nHe stopt again, rose again, and seemed quite embarrassed.--He was more\nin love with her than Emma had supposed; and who can say how it might\nhave ended, if his father had not made his appearance? Mr. Woodhouse\nsoon followed; and the necessity of exertion made him composed.\n\nA very few minutes more, however, completed the present trial. Mr.\nWeston, always alert when business was to be done, and as incapable of\nprocrastinating any evil that was inevitable, as of foreseeing any that\nwas doubtful, said, “It was time to go;” and the young man, though he\nmight and did sigh, could not but agree, to take leave.\n\n“I shall hear about you all,” said he; “that is my chief consolation.\nI shall hear of every thing that is going on among you. I have engaged\nMrs. Weston to correspond with me. She has been so kind as to promise\nit. Oh! the blessing of a female correspondent, when one is really\ninterested in the absent!--she will tell me every thing. In her letters\nI shall be at dear Highbury again.”\n\nA very friendly shake of the hand, a very earnest “Good-bye,” closed the\nspeech, and the door had soon shut out Frank Churchill. Short had been\nthe notice--short their meeting; he was gone; and Emma felt so sorry\nto part, and foresaw so great a loss to their little society from his\nabsence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry, and feeling it too\nmuch.\n\nIt was a sad change. They had been meeting almost every day since his\narrival. Certainly his being at Randalls had given great spirit to\nthe last two weeks--indescribable spirit; the idea, the expectation\nof seeing him which every morning had brought, the assurance of his\nattentions, his liveliness, his manners! It had been a very happy\nfortnight, and forlorn must be the sinking from it into the common\ncourse of Hartfield days. To complete every other recommendation, he had\n_almost_ told her that he loved her. What strength, or what constancy of\naffection he might be subject to, was another point; but at present\nshe could not doubt his having a decidedly warm admiration, a conscious\npreference of herself; and this persuasion, joined to all the rest,\nmade her think that she _must_ be a little in love with him, in spite of\nevery previous determination against it.\n\n“I certainly must,” said she. “This sensation of listlessness,\nweariness, stupidity, this disinclination to sit down and employ myself,\nthis feeling of every thing's being dull and insipid about the house!--\nI must be in love; I should be the oddest creature in the world if I\nwere not--for a few weeks at least. Well! evil to some is always good to\nothers. I shall have many fellow-mourners for the ball, if not for Frank\nChurchill; but Mr. Knightley will be happy. He may spend the evening\nwith his dear William Larkins now if he likes.”\n\nMr. Knightley, however, shewed no triumphant happiness. He could not say\nthat he was sorry on his own account; his very cheerful look would have\ncontradicted him if he had; but he said, and very steadily, that he\nwas sorry for the disappointment of the others, and with considerable\nkindness added,\n\n“You, Emma, who have so few opportunities of dancing, you are really out\nof luck; you are very much out of luck!”\n\nIt was some days before she saw Jane Fairfax, to judge of her honest\nregret in this woeful change; but when they did meet, her composure\nwas odious. She had been particularly unwell, however, suffering from\nheadache to a degree, which made her aunt declare, that had the ball\ntaken place, she did not think Jane could have attended it; and it was\ncharity to impute some of her unbecoming indifference to the languor of\nill-health.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\nEmma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love. Her ideas\nonly varied as to the how much. At first, she thought it was a good\ndeal; and afterwards, but little. She had great pleasure in hearing\nFrank Churchill talked of; and, for his sake, greater pleasure than ever\nin seeing Mr. and Mrs. Weston; she was very often thinking of him, and\nquite impatient for a letter, that she might know how he was, how were\nhis spirits, how was his aunt, and what was the chance of his coming to\nRandalls again this spring. But, on the other hand, she could not admit\nherself to be unhappy, nor, after the first morning, to be less disposed\nfor employment than usual; she was still busy and cheerful; and,\npleasing as he was, she could yet imagine him to have faults; and\nfarther, though thinking of him so much, and, as she sat drawing or\nworking, forming a thousand amusing schemes for the progress and close\nof their attachment, fancying interesting dialogues, and inventing\nelegant letters; the conclusion of every imaginary declaration on his\nside was that she _refused_ _him_. Their affection was always to subside\ninto friendship. Every thing tender and charming was to mark their\nparting; but still they were to part. When she became sensible of this,\nit struck her that she could not be very much in love; for in spite of\nher previous and fixed determination never to quit her father, never\nto marry, a strong attachment certainly must produce more of a struggle\nthan she could foresee in her own feelings.\n\n“I do not find myself making any use of the word _sacrifice_,” said\nshe.--“In not one of all my clever replies, my delicate negatives, is\nthere any allusion to making a sacrifice. I do suspect that he is not\nreally necessary to my happiness. So much the better. I certainly will\nnot persuade myself to feel more than I do. I am quite enough in love. I\nshould be sorry to be more.”\n\nUpon the whole, she was equally contented with her view of his feelings.\n\n“_He_ is undoubtedly very much in love--every thing denotes it--very\nmuch in love indeed!--and when he comes again, if his affection\ncontinue, I must be on my guard not to encourage it.--It would be most\ninexcusable to do otherwise, as my own mind is quite made up. Not that I\nimagine he can think I have been encouraging him hitherto. No, if he\nhad believed me at all to share his feelings, he would not have been\nso wretched. Could he have thought himself encouraged, his looks and\nlanguage at parting would have been different.--Still, however, I must\nbe on my guard. This is in the supposition of his attachment continuing\nwhat it now is; but I do not know that I expect it will; I do not look\nupon him to be quite the sort of man--I do not altogether build upon\nhis steadiness or constancy.--His feelings are warm, but I can imagine\nthem rather changeable.--Every consideration of the subject, in short,\nmakes me thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved.--I\nshall do very well again after a little while--and then, it will be a\ngood thing over; for they say every body is in love once in their lives,\nand I shall have been let off easily.”\n\nWhen his letter to Mrs. Weston arrived, Emma had the perusal of it; and\nshe read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made her\nat first shake her head over her own sensations, and think she had\nundervalued their strength. It was a long, well-written letter, giving\nthe particulars of his journey and of his feelings, expressing all the\naffection, gratitude, and respect which was natural and honourable,\nand describing every thing exterior and local that could be supposed\nattractive, with spirit and precision. No suspicious flourishes now of\napology or concern; it was the language of real feeling towards Mrs.\nWeston; and the transition from Highbury to Enscombe, the contrast\nbetween the places in some of the first blessings of social life was\njust enough touched on to shew how keenly it was felt, and how much more\nmight have been said but for the restraints of propriety.--The charm\nof her own name was not wanting. _Miss_ _Woodhouse_ appeared more than\nonce, and never without a something of pleasing connexion, either a\ncompliment to her taste, or a remembrance of what she had said; and in\nthe very last time of its meeting her eye, unadorned as it was by any\nsuch broad wreath of gallantry, she yet could discern the effect of\nher influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment perhaps of all\nconveyed. Compressed into the very lowest vacant corner were these\nwords--“I had not a spare moment on Tuesday, as you know, for Miss\nWoodhouse's beautiful little friend. Pray make my excuses and adieus\nto her.” This, Emma could not doubt, was all for herself. Harriet was\nremembered only from being _her_ friend. His information and prospects\nas to Enscombe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated;\nMrs. Churchill was recovering, and he dared not yet, even in his own\nimagination, fix a time for coming to Randalls again.\n\nGratifying, however, and stimulative as was the letter in the material\npart, its sentiments, she yet found, when it was folded up and returned\nto Mrs. Weston, that it had not added any lasting warmth, that she could\nstill do without the writer, and that he must learn to do without her.\nHer intentions were unchanged. Her resolution of refusal only grew more\ninteresting by the addition of a scheme for his subsequent consolation\nand happiness. His recollection of Harriet, and the words which\nclothed it, the “beautiful little friend,” suggested to her the\nidea of Harriet's succeeding her in his affections. Was it\nimpossible?--No.--Harriet undoubtedly was greatly his inferior in\nunderstanding; but he had been very much struck with the loveliness\nof her face and the warm simplicity of her manner; and all the\nprobabilities of circumstance and connexion were in her favour.--For\nHarriet, it would be advantageous and delightful indeed.\n\n“I must not dwell upon it,” said she.--“I must not think of it. I know\nthe danger of indulging such speculations. But stranger things have\nhappened; and when we cease to care for each other as we do now, it\nwill be the means of confirming us in that sort of true disinterested\nfriendship which I can already look forward to with pleasure.”\n\nIt was well to have a comfort in store on Harriet's behalf, though it\nmight be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom; for evil in that quarter\nwas at hand. As Frank Churchill's arrival had succeeded Mr. Elton's\nengagement in the conversation of Highbury, as the latest interest\nhad entirely borne down the first, so now upon Frank Churchill's\ndisappearance, Mr. Elton's concerns were assuming the most irresistible\nform.--His wedding-day was named. He would soon be among them again; Mr.\nElton and his bride. There was hardly time to talk over the first letter\nfrom Enscombe before “Mr. Elton and his bride” was in every body's\nmouth, and Frank Churchill was forgotten. Emma grew sick at the sound.\nShe had had three weeks of happy exemption from Mr. Elton; and Harriet's\nmind, she had been willing to hope, had been lately gaining strength.\nWith Mr. Weston's ball in view at least, there had been a great deal of\ninsensibility to other things; but it was now too evident that she had\nnot attained such a state of composure as could stand against the actual\napproach--new carriage, bell-ringing, and all.\n\nPoor Harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the\nreasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that Emma could\ngive. Emma felt that she could not do too much for her, that Harriet had\na right to all her ingenuity and all her patience; but it was heavy work\nto be for ever convincing without producing any effect, for ever agreed\nto, without being able to make their opinions the same. Harriet listened\nsubmissively, and said “it was very true--it was just as Miss Woodhouse\ndescribed--it was not worth while to think about them--and she would not\nthink about them any longer” but no change of subject could avail, and\nthe next half-hour saw her as anxious and restless about the Eltons as\nbefore. At last Emma attacked her on another ground.\n\n“Your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about Mr.\nElton's marrying, Harriet, is the strongest reproach you can make _me_.\nYou could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake I fell into.\nIt was all my doing, I know. I have not forgotten it, I assure\nyou.--Deceived myself, I did very miserably deceive you--and it will\nbe a painful reflection to me for ever. Do not imagine me in danger of\nforgetting it.”\n\nHarriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words of eager\nexclamation. Emma continued,\n\n“I have not said, exert yourself Harriet for my sake; think less, talk\nless of Mr. Elton for my sake; because for your own sake rather, I\nwould wish it to be done, for the sake of what is more important than my\ncomfort, a habit of self-command in you, a consideration of what is your\nduty, an attention to propriety, an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of\nothers, to save your health and credit, and restore your tranquillity.\nThese are the motives which I have been pressing on you. They are very\nimportant--and sorry I am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to act\nupon them. My being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration.\nI want you to save yourself from greater pain. Perhaps I may sometimes\nhave felt that Harriet would not forget what was due--or rather what\nwould be kind by me.”\n\nThis appeal to her affections did more than all the rest. The idea of\nwanting gratitude and consideration for Miss Woodhouse, whom she really\nloved extremely, made her wretched for a while, and when the violence\nof grief was comforted away, still remained powerful enough to prompt to\nwhat was right and support her in it very tolerably.\n\n“You, who have been the best friend I ever had in my life--Want\ngratitude to you!--Nobody is equal to you!--I care for nobody as I do\nfor you!--Oh! Miss Woodhouse, how ungrateful I have been!”\n\nSuch expressions, assisted as they were by every thing that look and\nmanner could do, made Emma feel that she had never loved Harriet so\nwell, nor valued her affection so highly before.\n\n“There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart,” said she afterwards to\nherself. “There is nothing to be compared to it. Warmth and tenderness\nof heart, with an affectionate, open manner, will beat all the\nclearness of head in the world, for attraction, I am sure it will. It\nis tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally\nbeloved--which gives Isabella all her popularity.--I have it not--but\nI know how to prize and respect it.--Harriet is my superior in all the\ncharm and all the felicity it gives. Dear Harriet!--I would not change\nyou for the clearest-headed, longest-sighted, best-judging female\nbreathing. Oh! the coldness of a Jane Fairfax!--Harriet is worth a\nhundred such--And for a wife--a sensible man's wife--it is invaluable. I\nmention no names; but happy the man who changes Emma for Harriet!”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\nMrs. Elton was first seen at church: but though devotion might be\ninterrupted, curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew, and\nit must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid, to\nsettle whether she were very pretty indeed, or only rather pretty, or\nnot pretty at all.\n\nEmma had feelings, less of curiosity than of pride or propriety, to make\nher resolve on not being the last to pay her respects; and she made a\npoint of Harriet's going with her, that the worst of the business might\nbe gone through as soon as possible.\n\nShe could not enter the house again, could not be in the same room to\nwhich she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago, to\nlace up her boot, without _recollecting_. A thousand vexatious thoughts\nwould recur. Compliments, charades, and horrible blunders; and it was\nnot to be supposed that poor Harriet should not be recollecting too; but\nshe behaved very well, and was only rather pale and silent. The visit\nwas of course short; and there was so much embarrassment and occupation\nof mind to shorten it, that Emma would not allow herself entirely to\nform an opinion of the lady, and on no account to give one, beyond the\nnothing-meaning terms of being “elegantly dressed, and very pleasing.”\n\nShe did not really like her. She would not be in a hurry to find fault,\nbut she suspected that there was no elegance;--ease, but not elegance.--\nShe was almost sure that for a young woman, a stranger, a bride, there\nwas too much ease. Her person was rather good; her face not unpretty;\nbut neither feature, nor air, nor voice, nor manner, were elegant. Emma\nthought at least it would turn out so.\n\nAs for Mr. Elton, his manners did not appear--but no, she would not\npermit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners. It was an\nawkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits, and a man\nhad need be all grace to acquit himself well through it. The woman\nwas better off; she might have the assistance of fine clothes, and the\nprivilege of bashfulness, but the man had only his own good sense to\ndepend on; and when she considered how peculiarly unlucky poor Mr.\nElton was in being in the same room at once with the woman he had just\nmarried, the woman he had wanted to marry, and the woman whom he had\nbeen expected to marry, she must allow him to have the right to look as\nlittle wise, and to be as much affectedly, and as little really easy as\ncould be.\n\n“Well, Miss Woodhouse,” said Harriet, when they had quitted the\nhouse, and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin; “Well, Miss\nWoodhouse, (with a gentle sigh,) what do you think of her?--Is not she\nvery charming?”\n\nThere was a little hesitation in Emma's answer.\n\n“Oh! yes--very--a very pleasing young woman.”\n\n“I think her beautiful, quite beautiful.”\n\n“Very nicely dressed, indeed; a remarkably elegant gown.”\n\n“I am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love.”\n\n“Oh! no--there is nothing to surprize one at all.--A pretty fortune; and\nshe came in his way.”\n\n“I dare say,” returned Harriet, sighing again, “I dare say she was very\nmuch attached to him.”\n\n“Perhaps she might; but it is not every man's fate to marry the woman\nwho loves him best. Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home, and thought this\nthe best offer she was likely to have.”\n\n“Yes,” said Harriet earnestly, “and well she might, nobody could ever\nhave a better. Well, I wish them happy with all my heart. And now, Miss\nWoodhouse, I do not think I shall mind seeing them again. He is just as\nsuperior as ever;--but being married, you know, it is quite a different\nthing. No, indeed, Miss Woodhouse, you need not be afraid; I can sit and\nadmire him now without any great misery. To know that he has not thrown\nhimself away, is such a comfort!--She does seem a charming young woman,\njust what he deserves. Happy creature! He called her 'Augusta.' How\ndelightful!”\n\nWhen the visit was returned, Emma made up her mind. She could then see\nmore and judge better. From Harriet's happening not to be at Hartfield,\nand her father's being present to engage Mr. Elton, she had a quarter\nof an hour of the lady's conversation to herself, and could composedly\nattend to her; and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her that\nMrs. Elton was a vain woman, extremely well satisfied with herself, and\nthinking much of her own importance; that she meant to shine and be very\nsuperior, but with manners which had been formed in a bad school, pert\nand familiar; that all her notions were drawn from one set of people,\nand one style of living; that if not foolish she was ignorant, and that\nher society would certainly do Mr. Elton no good.\n\nHarriet would have been a better match. If not wise or refined herself,\nshe would have connected him with those who were; but Miss Hawkins, it\nmight be fairly supposed from her easy conceit, had been the best of\nher own set. The rich brother-in-law near Bristol was the pride of the\nalliance, and his place and his carriages were the pride of him.\n\nThe very first subject after being seated was Maple Grove, “My brother\nMr. Suckling's seat;”--a comparison of Hartfield to Maple Grove. The\ngrounds of Hartfield were small, but neat and pretty; and the house was\nmodern and well-built. Mrs. Elton seemed most favourably impressed\nby the size of the room, the entrance, and all that she could see or\nimagine. “Very like Maple Grove indeed!--She was quite struck by the\nlikeness!--That room was the very shape and size of the morning-room\nat Maple Grove; her sister's favourite room.”--Mr. Elton was appealed\nto.--“Was not it astonishingly like?--She could really almost fancy\nherself at Maple Grove.”\n\n“And the staircase--You know, as I came in, I observed how very like the\nstaircase was; placed exactly in the same part of the house. I really\ncould not help exclaiming! I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, it is very\ndelightful to me, to be reminded of a place I am so extremely partial to\nas Maple Grove. I have spent so many happy months there! (with a little\nsigh of sentiment). A charming place, undoubtedly. Every body who\nsees it is struck by its beauty; but to me, it has been quite a home.\nWhenever you are transplanted, like me, Miss Woodhouse, you will\nunderstand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like\nwhat one has left behind. I always say this is quite one of the evils of\nmatrimony.”\n\nEmma made as slight a reply as she could; but it was fully sufficient\nfor Mrs. Elton, who only wanted to be talking herself.\n\n“So extremely like Maple Grove! And it is not merely the house--the\ngrounds, I assure you, as far as I could observe, are strikingly like.\nThe laurels at Maple Grove are in the same profusion as here, and stand\nvery much in the same way--just across the lawn; and I had a glimpse\nof a fine large tree, with a bench round it, which put me so exactly in\nmind! My brother and sister will be enchanted with this place. People\nwho have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing\nin the same style.”\n\nEmma doubted the truth of this sentiment. She had a great idea that\npeople who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little for the\nextensive grounds of any body else; but it was not worth while to attack\nan error so double-dyed, and therefore only said in reply,\n\n“When you have seen more of this country, I am afraid you will think you\nhave overrated Hartfield. Surry is full of beauties.”\n\n“Oh! yes, I am quite aware of that. It is the garden of England, you\nknow. Surry is the garden of England.”\n\n“Yes; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction. Many\ncounties, I believe, are called the garden of England, as well as\nSurry.”\n\n“No, I fancy not,” replied Mrs. Elton, with a most satisfied smile.\n“I never heard any county but Surry called so.”\n\nEmma was silenced.\n\n“My brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring, or summer\nat farthest,” continued Mrs. Elton; “and that will be our time for\nexploring. While they are with us, we shall explore a great deal, I dare\nsay. They will have their barouche-landau, of course, which holds four\nperfectly; and therefore, without saying any thing of _our_ carriage,\nwe should be able to explore the different beauties extremely well. They\nwould hardly come in their chaise, I think, at that season of the\nyear. Indeed, when the time draws on, I shall decidedly recommend their\nbringing the barouche-landau; it will be so very much preferable.\nWhen people come into a beautiful country of this sort, you know, Miss\nWoodhouse, one naturally wishes them to see as much as possible; and Mr.\nSuckling is extremely fond of exploring. We explored to King's-Weston\ntwice last summer, in that way, most delightfully, just after their\nfirst having the barouche-landau. You have many parties of that kind\nhere, I suppose, Miss Woodhouse, every summer?”\n\n“No; not immediately here. We are rather out of distance of the very\nstriking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of; and we\nare a very quiet set of people, I believe; more disposed to stay at home\nthan engage in schemes of pleasure.”\n\n“Ah! there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort. Nobody can\nbe more devoted to home than I am. I was quite a proverb for it at Maple\nGrove. Many a time has Selina said, when she has been going to Bristol,\n'I really cannot get this girl to move from the house. I absolutely must\ngo in by myself, though I hate being stuck up in the barouche-landau\nwithout a companion; but Augusta, I believe, with her own good-will,\nwould never stir beyond the park paling.' Many a time has she said so;\nand yet I am no advocate for entire seclusion. I think, on the contrary,\nwhen people shut themselves up entirely from society, it is a very\nbad thing; and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in\na proper degree, without living in it either too much or too little. I\nperfectly understand your situation, however, Miss Woodhouse--(looking\ntowards Mr. Woodhouse), Your father's state of health must be a great\ndrawback. Why does not he try Bath?--Indeed he should. Let me recommend\nBath to you. I assure you I have no doubt of its doing Mr. Woodhouse\ngood.”\n\n“My father tried it more than once, formerly; but without receiving any\nbenefit; and Mr. Perry, whose name, I dare say, is not unknown to you,\ndoes not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now.”\n\n“Ah! that's a great pity; for I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, where the\nwaters do agree, it is quite wonderful the relief they give. In my Bath\nlife, I have seen such instances of it! And it is so cheerful a place,\nthat it could not fail of being of use to Mr. Woodhouse's spirits,\nwhich, I understand, are sometimes much depressed. And as to its\nrecommendations to _you_, I fancy I need not take much pains to dwell\non them. The advantages of Bath to the young are pretty generally\nunderstood. It would be a charming introduction for you, who have lived\nso secluded a life; and I could immediately secure you some of the best\nsociety in the place. A line from me would bring you a little host of\nacquaintance; and my particular friend, Mrs. Partridge, the lady I have\nalways resided with when in Bath, would be most happy to shew you any\nattentions, and would be the very person for you to go into public\nwith.”\n\nIt was as much as Emma could bear, without being impolite. The idea\nof her being indebted to Mrs. Elton for what was called an\n_introduction_--of her going into public under the auspices of a friend\nof Mrs. Elton's--probably some vulgar, dashing widow, who, with the\nhelp of a boarder, just made a shift to live!--The dignity of Miss\nWoodhouse, of Hartfield, was sunk indeed!\n\nShe restrained herself, however, from any of the reproofs she could have\ngiven, and only thanked Mrs. Elton coolly; “but their going to Bath was\nquite out of the question; and she was not perfectly convinced that\nthe place might suit her better than her father.” And then, to prevent\nfarther outrage and indignation, changed the subject directly.\n\n“I do not ask whether you are musical, Mrs. Elton. Upon these occasions,\na lady's character generally precedes her; and Highbury has long known\nthat you are a superior performer.”\n\n“Oh! no, indeed; I must protest against any such idea. A superior\nperformer!--very far from it, I assure you. Consider from how partial\na quarter your information came. I am doatingly fond of\nmusic--passionately fond;--and my friends say I am not entirely devoid\nof taste; but as to any thing else, upon my honour my performance is\n_mediocre_ to the last degree. You, Miss Woodhouse, I well know, play\ndelightfully. I assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction,\ncomfort, and delight to me, to hear what a musical society I am got\ninto. I absolutely cannot do without music. It is a necessary of life to\nme; and having always been used to a very musical society, both at\nMaple Grove and in Bath, it would have been a most serious sacrifice. I\nhonestly said as much to Mr. E. when he was speaking of my future\nhome, and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be\ndisagreeable; and the inferiority of the house too--knowing what I had\nbeen accustomed to--of course he was not wholly without apprehension.\nWhen he was speaking of it in that way, I honestly said that _the_\n_world_ I could give up--parties, balls, plays--for I had no fear of\nretirement. Blessed with so many resources within myself, the world was\nnot necessary to _me_. I could do very well without it. To those who had\nno resources it was a different thing; but my resources made me quite\nindependent. And as to smaller-sized rooms than I had been used to, I\nreally could not give it a thought. I hoped I was perfectly equal to any\nsacrifice of that description. Certainly I had been accustomed to every\nluxury at Maple Grove; but I did assure him that two carriages were not\nnecessary to my happiness, nor were spacious apartments. 'But,' said I,\n'to be quite honest, I do not think I can live without something of a\nmusical society. I condition for nothing else; but without music, life\nwould be a blank to me.'”\n\n“We cannot suppose,” said Emma, smiling, “that Mr. Elton would hesitate\nto assure you of there being a _very_ musical society in Highbury; and\nI hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be\npardoned, in consideration of the motive.”\n\n“No, indeed, I have no doubts at all on that head. I am delighted to\nfind myself in such a circle. I hope we shall have many sweet little\nconcerts together. I think, Miss Woodhouse, you and I must establish a\nmusical club, and have regular weekly meetings at your house, or ours.\nWill not it be a good plan? If _we_ exert ourselves, I think we shall\nnot be long in want of allies. Something of that nature would be\nparticularly desirable for _me_, as an inducement to keep me in\npractice; for married women, you know--there is a sad story against\nthem, in general. They are but too apt to give up music.”\n\n“But you, who are so extremely fond of it--there can be no danger,\nsurely?”\n\n“I should hope not; but really when I look around among my acquaintance,\nI tremble. Selina has entirely given up music--never touches the\ninstrument--though she played sweetly. And the same may be said of Mrs.\nJeffereys--Clara Partridge, that was--and of the two Milmans, now Mrs.\nBird and Mrs. James Cooper; and of more than I can enumerate. Upon my\nword it is enough to put one in a fright. I used to be quite angry with\nSelina; but really I begin now to comprehend that a married woman has\nmany things to call her attention. I believe I was half an hour this\nmorning shut up with my housekeeper.”\n\n“But every thing of that kind,” said Emma, “will soon be in so regular a\ntrain--”\n\n“Well,” said Mrs. Elton, laughing, “we shall see.”\n\nEmma, finding her so determined upon neglecting her music, had nothing\nmore to say; and, after a moment's pause, Mrs. Elton chose another\nsubject.\n\n“We have been calling at Randalls,” said she, “and found them both at\nhome; and very pleasant people they seem to be. I like them extremely.\nMr. Weston seems an excellent creature--quite a first-rate favourite\nwith me already, I assure you. And _she_ appears so truly good--there is\nsomething so motherly and kind-hearted about her, that it wins upon one\ndirectly. She was your governess, I think?”\n\nEmma was almost too much astonished to answer; but Mrs. Elton hardly\nwaited for the affirmative before she went on.\n\n“Having understood as much, I was rather astonished to find her so very\nlady-like! But she is really quite the gentlewoman.”\n\n“Mrs. Weston's manners,” said Emma, “were always particularly good.\nTheir propriety, simplicity, and elegance, would make them the safest\nmodel for any young woman.”\n\n“And who do you think came in while we were there?”\n\nEmma was quite at a loss. The tone implied some old acquaintance--and\nhow could she possibly guess?\n\n“Knightley!” continued Mrs. Elton; “Knightley himself!--Was not it\nlucky?--for, not being within when he called the other day, I had never\nseen him before; and of course, as so particular a friend of Mr. E.'s,\nI had a great curiosity. 'My friend Knightley' had been so often\nmentioned, that I was really impatient to see him; and I must do my\ncaro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his friend.\nKnightley is quite the gentleman. I like him very much. Decidedly, I\nthink, a very gentleman-like man.”\n\nHappily, it was now time to be gone. They were off; and Emma could\nbreathe.\n\n“Insufferable woman!” was her immediate exclamation. “Worse than I had\nsupposed. Absolutely insufferable! Knightley!--I could not have\nbelieved it. Knightley!--never seen him in her life before, and call\nhim Knightley!--and discover that he is a gentleman! A little upstart,\nvulgar being, with her Mr. E., and her _caro_ _sposo_, and her\nresources, and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred finery.\nActually to discover that Mr. Knightley is a gentleman! I doubt whether\nhe will return the compliment, and discover her to be a lady. I could\nnot have believed it! And to propose that she and I should unite to\nform a musical club! One would fancy we were bosom friends! And Mrs.\nWeston!--Astonished that the person who had brought me up should be a\ngentlewoman! Worse and worse. I never met with her equal. Much beyond\nmy hopes. Harriet is disgraced by any comparison. Oh! what would Frank\nChurchill say to her, if he were here? How angry and how diverted he\nwould be! Ah! there I am--thinking of him directly. Always the first\nperson to be thought of! How I catch myself out! Frank Churchill comes\nas regularly into my mind!”--\n\nAll this ran so glibly through her thoughts, that by the time her father\nhad arranged himself, after the bustle of the Eltons' departure, and was\nready to speak, she was very tolerably capable of attending.\n\n“Well, my dear,” he deliberately began, “considering we never saw her\nbefore, she seems a very pretty sort of young lady; and I dare say she\nwas very much pleased with you. She speaks a little too quick. A little\nquickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear. But I believe\nI am nice; I do not like strange voices; and nobody speaks like you and\npoor Miss Taylor. However, she seems a very obliging, pretty-behaved\nyoung lady, and no doubt will make him a very good wife. Though I think\nhe had better not have married. I made the best excuses I could for not\nhaving been able to wait on him and Mrs. Elton on this happy occasion; I\nsaid that I hoped I _should_ in the course of the summer. But I ought to\nhave gone before. Not to wait upon a bride is very remiss. Ah! it shews\nwhat a sad invalid I am! But I do not like the corner into Vicarage\nLane.”\n\n“I dare say your apologies were accepted, sir. Mr. Elton knows you.”\n\n“Yes: but a young lady--a bride--I ought to have paid my respects to her\nif possible. It was being very deficient.”\n\n“But, my dear papa, you are no friend to matrimony; and therefore why\nshould you be so anxious to pay your respects to a _bride_? It ought to\nbe no recommendation to _you_. It is encouraging people to marry if you\nmake so much of them.”\n\n“No, my dear, I never encouraged any body to marry, but I would always\nwish to pay every proper attention to a lady--and a bride, especially,\nis never to be neglected. More is avowedly due to _her_. A bride, you\nknow, my dear, is always the first in company, let the others be who\nthey may.”\n\n“Well, papa, if this is not encouragement to marry, I do not know what\nis. And I should never have expected you to be lending your sanction to\nsuch vanity-baits for poor young ladies.”\n\n“My dear, you do not understand me. This is a matter of mere\ncommon politeness and good-breeding, and has nothing to do with any\nencouragement to people to marry.”\n\nEmma had done. Her father was growing nervous, and could not understand\n_her_. Her mind returned to Mrs. Elton's offences, and long, very long,\ndid they occupy her.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n\nEmma was not required, by any subsequent discovery, to retract her ill\nopinion of Mrs. Elton. Her observation had been pretty correct. Such as\nMrs. Elton appeared to her on this second interview, such she appeared\nwhenever they met again,--self-important, presuming, familiar, ignorant,\nand ill-bred. She had a little beauty and a little accomplishment,\nbut so little judgment that she thought herself coming with superior\nknowledge of the world, to enliven and improve a country neighbourhood;\nand conceived Miss Hawkins to have held such a place in society as Mrs.\nElton's consequence only could surpass.\n\nThere was no reason to suppose Mr. Elton thought at all differently from\nhis wife. He seemed not merely happy with her, but proud. He had the air\nof congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to Highbury,\nas not even Miss Woodhouse could equal; and the greater part of her\nnew acquaintance, disposed to commend, or not in the habit of judging,\nfollowing the lead of Miss Bates's good-will, or taking it for granted\nthat the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she professed\nherself, were very well satisfied; so that Mrs. Elton's praise\npassed from one mouth to another as it ought to do, unimpeded by Miss\nWoodhouse, who readily continued her first contribution and talked with\na good grace of her being “very pleasant and very elegantly dressed.”\n\nIn one respect Mrs. Elton grew even worse than she had appeared at\nfirst. Her feelings altered towards Emma.--Offended, probably, by the\nlittle encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with, she drew\nback in her turn and gradually became much more cold and distant; and\nthough the effect was agreeable, the ill-will which produced it was\nnecessarily increasing Emma's dislike. Her manners, too--and Mr.\nElton's, were unpleasant towards Harriet. They were sneering and\nnegligent. Emma hoped it must rapidly work Harriet's cure; but the\nsensations which could prompt such behaviour sunk them both very\nmuch.--It was not to be doubted that poor Harriet's attachment had been\nan offering to conjugal unreserve, and her own share in the story, under\na colouring the least favourable to her and the most soothing to him,\nhad in all likelihood been given also. She was, of course, the object\nof their joint dislike.--When they had nothing else to say, it must be\nalways easy to begin abusing Miss Woodhouse; and the enmity which\nthey dared not shew in open disrespect to her, found a broader vent in\ncontemptuous treatment of Harriet.\n\nMrs. Elton took a great fancy to Jane Fairfax; and from the first. Not\nmerely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to\nrecommend the other, but from the very first; and she was not satisfied\nwith expressing a natural and reasonable admiration--but without\nsolicitation, or plea, or privilege, she must be wanting to assist and\nbefriend her.--Before Emma had forfeited her confidence, and about the\nthird time of their meeting, she heard all Mrs. Elton's knight-errantry\non the subject.--\n\n“Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming, Miss Woodhouse.--I quite rave\nabout Jane Fairfax.--A sweet, interesting creature. So mild and\nladylike--and with such talents!--I assure you I think she has very\nextraordinary talents. I do not scruple to say that she plays extremely\nwell. I know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point. Oh! she\nis absolutely charming! You will laugh at my warmth--but, upon my word,\nI talk of nothing but Jane Fairfax.--And her situation is so calculated\nto affect one!--Miss Woodhouse, we must exert ourselves and endeavour\nto do something for her. We must bring her forward. Such talent as hers\nmust not be suffered to remain unknown.--I dare say you have heard those\ncharming lines of the poet,\n\n        'Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,\n          'And waste its fragrance on the desert air.'\n\nWe must not allow them to be verified in sweet Jane Fairfax.”\n\n“I cannot think there is any danger of it,” was Emma's calm answer--“and\nwhen you are better acquainted with Miss Fairfax's situation and\nunderstand what her home has been, with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell, I\nhave no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown.”\n\n“Oh! but dear Miss Woodhouse, she is now in such retirement, such\nobscurity, so thrown away.--Whatever advantages she may have enjoyed\nwith the Campbells are so palpably at an end! And I think she feels it.\nI am sure she does. She is very timid and silent. One can see that she\nfeels the want of encouragement. I like her the better for it. I\nmust confess it is a recommendation to me. I am a great advocate for\ntimidity--and I am sure one does not often meet with it.--But in those\nwho are at all inferior, it is extremely prepossessing. Oh! I assure\nyou, Jane Fairfax is a very delightful character, and interests me more\nthan I can express.”\n\n“You appear to feel a great deal--but I am not aware how you or any of\nMiss Fairfax's acquaintance here, any of those who have known her longer\nthan yourself, can shew her any other attention than”--\n\n“My dear Miss Woodhouse, a vast deal may be done by those who dare to\nact. You and I need not be afraid. If _we_ set the example, many will\nfollow it as far as they can; though all have not our situations. _We_\nhave carriages to fetch and convey her home, and _we_ live in a style\nwhich could not make the addition of Jane Fairfax, at any time, the\nleast inconvenient.--I should be extremely displeased if Wright were to\nsend us up such a dinner, as could make me regret having asked _more_\nthan Jane Fairfax to partake of it. I have no idea of that sort of\nthing. It is not likely that I _should_, considering what I have been\nused to. My greatest danger, perhaps, in housekeeping, may be quite the\nother way, in doing too much, and being too careless of expense. Maple\nGrove will probably be my model more than it ought to be--for we do not\nat all affect to equal my brother, Mr. Suckling, in income.--However, my\nresolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax.--I shall certainly have\nher very often at my house, shall introduce her wherever I can, shall\nhave musical parties to draw out her talents, and shall be constantly\non the watch for an eligible situation. My acquaintance is so very\nextensive, that I have little doubt of hearing of something to suit\nher shortly.--I shall introduce her, of course, very particularly to my\nbrother and sister when they come to us. I am sure they will like her\nextremely; and when she gets a little acquainted with them, her fears\nwill completely wear off, for there really is nothing in the manners\nof either but what is highly conciliating.--I shall have her very often\nindeed while they are with me, and I dare say we shall sometimes find a\nseat for her in the barouche-landau in some of our exploring parties.”\n\n“Poor Jane Fairfax!”--thought Emma.--“You have not deserved this. You\nmay have done wrong with regard to Mr. Dixon, but this is a punishment\nbeyond what you can have merited!--The kindness and protection of Mrs.\nElton!--'Jane Fairfax and Jane Fairfax.' Heavens! Let me not suppose\nthat she dares go about, Emma Woodhouse-ing me!--But upon my honour,\nthere seems no limits to the licentiousness of that woman's tongue!”\n\nEmma had not to listen to such paradings again--to any so exclusively\naddressed to herself--so disgustingly decorated with a “dear Miss\nWoodhouse.” The change on Mrs. Elton's side soon afterwards appeared,\nand she was left in peace--neither forced to be the very particular\nfriend of Mrs. Elton, nor, under Mrs. Elton's guidance, the very active\npatroness of Jane Fairfax, and only sharing with others in a general\nway, in knowing what was felt, what was meditated, what was done.\n\nShe looked on with some amusement.--Miss Bates's gratitude for\nMrs. Elton's attentions to Jane was in the first style of guileless\nsimplicity and warmth. She was quite one of her worthies--the\nmost amiable, affable, delightful woman--just as accomplished and\ncondescending as Mrs. Elton meant to be considered. Emma's only surprize\nwas that Jane Fairfax should accept those attentions and tolerate Mrs.\nElton as she seemed to do. She heard of her walking with the Eltons,\nsitting with the Eltons, spending a day with the Eltons! This was\nastonishing!--She could not have believed it possible that the taste or\nthe pride of Miss Fairfax could endure such society and friendship as\nthe Vicarage had to offer.\n\n“She is a riddle, quite a riddle!” said she.--“To chuse to remain here\nmonth after month, under privations of every sort! And now to chuse the\nmortification of Mrs. Elton's notice and the penury of her conversation,\nrather than return to the superior companions who have always loved her\nwith such real, generous affection.”\n\nJane had come to Highbury professedly for three months; the Campbells\nwere gone to Ireland for three months; but now the Campbells had\npromised their daughter to stay at least till Midsummer, and fresh\ninvitations had arrived for her to join them there. According to Miss\nBates--it all came from her--Mrs. Dixon had written most pressingly.\nWould Jane but go, means were to be found, servants sent, friends\ncontrived--no travelling difficulty allowed to exist; but still she had\ndeclined it!\n\n“She must have some motive, more powerful than appears, for refusing\nthis invitation,” was Emma's conclusion. “She must be under some sort\nof penance, inflicted either by the Campbells or herself. There is great\nfear, great caution, great resolution somewhere.--She is _not_ to be\nwith the _Dixons_. The decree is issued by somebody. But why must she\nconsent to be with the Eltons?--Here is quite a separate puzzle.”\n\nUpon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject, before\nthe few who knew her opinion of Mrs. Elton, Mrs. Weston ventured this\napology for Jane.\n\n“We cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the Vicarage,\nmy dear Emma--but it is better than being always at home. Her aunt is a\ngood creature, but, as a constant companion, must be very tiresome. We\nmust consider what Miss Fairfax quits, before we condemn her taste for\nwhat she goes to.”\n\n“You are right, Mrs. Weston,” said Mr. Knightley warmly, “Miss Fairfax\nis as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Mrs. Elton.\nCould she have chosen with whom to associate, she would not have chosen\nher. But (with a reproachful smile at Emma) she receives attentions from\nMrs. Elton, which nobody else pays her.”\n\nEmma felt that Mrs. Weston was giving her a momentary glance; and she\nwas herself struck by his warmth. With a faint blush, she presently\nreplied,\n\n“Such attentions as Mrs. Elton's, I should have imagined, would rather\ndisgust than gratify Miss Fairfax. Mrs. Elton's invitations I should\nhave imagined any thing but inviting.”\n\n“I should not wonder,” said Mrs. Weston, “if Miss Fairfax were to have\nbeen drawn on beyond her own inclination, by her aunt's eagerness in\naccepting Mrs. Elton's civilities for her. Poor Miss Bates may\nvery likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater\nappearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated, in\nspite of the very natural wish of a little change.”\n\nBoth felt rather anxious to hear him speak again; and after a few\nminutes silence, he said,\n\n“Another thing must be taken into consideration too--Mrs. Elton does\nnot talk _to_ Miss Fairfax as she speaks _of_ her. We all know the\ndifference between the pronouns he or she and thou, the plainest spoken\namongst us; we all feel the influence of a something beyond common\ncivility in our personal intercourse with each other--a something more\nearly implanted. We cannot give any body the disagreeable hints that we\nmay have been very full of the hour before. We feel things differently.\nAnd besides the operation of this, as a general principle, you may be\nsure that Miss Fairfax awes Mrs. Elton by her superiority both of mind\nand manner; and that, face to face, Mrs. Elton treats her with all the\nrespect which she has a claim to. Such a woman as Jane Fairfax probably\nnever fell in Mrs. Elton's way before--and no degree of vanity can\nprevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action, if\nnot in consciousness.”\n\n“I know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax,” said Emma. Little Henry\nwas in her thoughts, and a mixture of alarm and delicacy made her\nirresolute what else to say.\n\n“Yes,” he replied, “any body may know how highly I think of her.”\n\n“And yet,” said Emma, beginning hastily and with an arch look, but soon\nstopping--it was better, however, to know the worst at once--she hurried\non--“And yet, perhaps, you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it\nis. The extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day or\nother.”\n\nMr. Knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick\nleather gaiters, and either the exertion of getting them together, or\nsome other cause, brought the colour into his face, as he answered,\n\n“Oh! are you there?--But you are miserably behindhand. Mr. Cole gave me\na hint of it six weeks ago.”\n\nHe stopped.--Emma felt her foot pressed by Mrs. Weston, and did not\nherself know what to think. In a moment he went on--\n\n“That will never be, however, I can assure you. Miss Fairfax, I dare\nsay, would not have me if I were to ask her--and I am very sure I shall\nnever ask her.”\n\nEmma returned her friend's pressure with interest; and was pleased\nenough to exclaim,\n\n“You are not vain, Mr. Knightley. I will say that for you.”\n\nHe seemed hardly to hear her; he was thoughtful--and in a manner which\nshewed him not pleased, soon afterwards said,\n\n“So you have been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax?”\n\n“No indeed I have not. You have scolded me too much for match-making,\nfor me to presume to take such a liberty with you. What I said just now,\nmeant nothing. One says those sort of things, of course, without any\nidea of a serious meaning. Oh! no, upon my word I have not the smallest\nwish for your marrying Jane Fairfax or Jane any body. You would not come\nin and sit with us in this comfortable way, if you were married.”\n\nMr. Knightley was thoughtful again. The result of his reverie was, “No,\nEmma, I do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take\nme by surprize.--I never had a thought of her in that way, I assure\nyou.” And soon afterwards, “Jane Fairfax is a very charming young\nwoman--but not even Jane Fairfax is perfect. She has a fault. She has\nnot the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife.”\n\nEmma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault. “Well,” said\nshe, “and you soon silenced Mr. Cole, I suppose?”\n\n“Yes, very soon. He gave me a quiet hint; I told him he was mistaken;\nhe asked my pardon and said no more. Cole does not want to be wiser or\nwittier than his neighbours.”\n\n“In that respect how unlike dear Mrs. Elton, who wants to be wiser and\nwittier than all the world! I wonder how she speaks of the Coles--what\nshe calls them! How can she find any appellation for them, deep enough\nin familiar vulgarity? She calls you, Knightley--what can she do for\nMr. Cole? And so I am not to be surprized that Jane Fairfax accepts\nher civilities and consents to be with her. Mrs. Weston, your argument\nweighs most with me. I can much more readily enter into the temptation\nof getting away from Miss Bates, than I can believe in the triumph of\nMiss Fairfax's mind over Mrs. Elton. I have no faith in Mrs. Elton's\nacknowledging herself the inferior in thought, word, or deed; or in her\nbeing under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good-breeding.\nI cannot imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor\nwith praise, encouragement, and offers of service; that she will not be\ncontinually detailing her magnificent intentions, from the procuring her\na permanent situation to the including her in those delightful exploring\nparties which are to take place in the barouche-landau.”\n\n“Jane Fairfax has feeling,” said Mr. Knightley--“I do not accuse her\nof want of feeling. Her sensibilities, I suspect, are strong--and her\ntemper excellent in its power of forbearance, patience, self-control;\nbut it wants openness. She is reserved, more reserved, I think, than\nshe used to be--And I love an open temper. No--till Cole alluded to my\nsupposed attachment, it had never entered my head. I saw Jane Fairfax\nand conversed with her, with admiration and pleasure always--but with no\nthought beyond.”\n\n“Well, Mrs. Weston,” said Emma triumphantly when he left them, “what do\nyou say now to Mr. Knightley's marrying Jane Fairfax?”\n\n“Why, really, dear Emma, I say that he is so very much occupied by the\nidea of _not_ being in love with her, that I should not wonder if it\nwere to end in his being so at last. Do not beat me.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\nEvery body in and about Highbury who had ever visited Mr. Elton, was\ndisposed to pay him attention on his marriage. Dinner-parties and\nevening-parties were made for him and his lady; and invitations flowed\nin so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending they were\nnever to have a disengaged day.\n\n“I see how it is,” said she. “I see what a life I am to lead among you.\nUpon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated. We really seem quite\nthe fashion. If this is living in the country, it is nothing very\nformidable. From Monday next to Saturday, I assure you we have not a\ndisengaged day!--A woman with fewer resources than I have, need not have\nbeen at a loss.”\n\nNo invitation came amiss to her. Her Bath habits made evening-parties\nperfectly natural to her, and Maple Grove had given her a taste for\ndinners. She was a little shocked at the want of two drawing rooms, at\nthe poor attempt at rout-cakes, and there being no ice in the Highbury\ncard-parties. Mrs. Bates, Mrs. Perry, Mrs. Goddard and others, were a\ngood deal behind-hand in knowledge of the world, but she would soon shew\nthem how every thing ought to be arranged. In the course of the spring\nshe must return their civilities by one very superior party--in which\nher card-tables should be set out with their separate candles and\nunbroken packs in the true style--and more waiters engaged for the\nevening than their own establishment could furnish, to carry round the\nrefreshments at exactly the proper hour, and in the proper order.\n\nEmma, in the meanwhile, could not be satisfied without a dinner at\nHartfield for the Eltons. They must not do less than others, or she\nshould be exposed to odious suspicions, and imagined capable of pitiful\nresentment. A dinner there must be. After Emma had talked about it for\nten minutes, Mr. Woodhouse felt no unwillingness, and only made the\nusual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself,\nwith the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him.\n\nThe persons to be invited, required little thought. Besides the\nEltons, it must be the Westons and Mr. Knightley; so far it was all of\ncourse--and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little Harriet must\nbe asked to make the eighth:--but this invitation was not given with\nequal satisfaction, and on many accounts Emma was particularly pleased\nby Harriet's begging to be allowed to decline it. “She would rather not\nbe in his company more than she could help. She was not yet quite\nable to see him and his charming happy wife together, without feeling\nuncomfortable. If Miss Woodhouse would not be displeased, she would\nrather stay at home.” It was precisely what Emma would have wished, had\nshe deemed it possible enough for wishing. She was delighted with the\nfortitude of her little friend--for fortitude she knew it was in her to\ngive up being in company and stay at home; and she could now invite the\nvery person whom she really wanted to make the eighth, Jane Fairfax.--\nSince her last conversation with Mrs. Weston and Mr. Knightley, she\nwas more conscience-stricken about Jane Fairfax than she had often\nbeen.--Mr. Knightley's words dwelt with her. He had said that Jane\nFairfax received attentions from Mrs. Elton which nobody else paid her.\n\n“This is very true,” said she, “at least as far as relates to me, which\nwas all that was meant--and it is very shameful.--Of the same age--and\nalways knowing her--I ought to have been more her friend.--She will\nnever like me now. I have neglected her too long. But I will shew her\ngreater attention than I have done.”\n\nEvery invitation was successful. They were all disengaged and all\nhappy.--The preparatory interest of this dinner, however, was not yet\nover. A circumstance rather unlucky occurred. The two eldest little\nKnightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of some\nweeks in the spring, and their papa now proposed bringing them, and\nstaying one whole day at Hartfield--which one day would be the very day\nof this party.--His professional engagements did not allow of his being\nput off, but both father and daughter were disturbed by its happening\nso. Mr. Woodhouse considered eight persons at dinner together as the\nutmost that his nerves could bear--and here would be a ninth--and Emma\napprehended that it would be a ninth very much out of humour at not\nbeing able to come even to Hartfield for forty-eight hours without\nfalling in with a dinner-party.\n\nShe comforted her father better than she could comfort herself, by\nrepresenting that though he certainly would make them nine, yet\nhe always said so little, that the increase of noise would be very\nimmaterial. She thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself, to\nhave him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed to her\ninstead of his brother.\n\nThe event was more favourable to Mr. Woodhouse than to Emma. John\nKnightley came; but Mr. Weston was unexpectedly summoned to town and\nmust be absent on the very day. He might be able to join them in the\nevening, but certainly not to dinner. Mr. Woodhouse was quite at ease;\nand the seeing him so, with the arrival of the little boys and the\nphilosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate, removed the\nchief of even Emma's vexation.\n\nThe day came, the party were punctually assembled, and Mr. John\nKnightley seemed early to devote himself to the business of being\nagreeable. Instead of drawing his brother off to a window while they\nwaited for dinner, he was talking to Miss Fairfax. Mrs. Elton,\nas elegant as lace and pearls could make her, he looked at in\nsilence--wanting only to observe enough for Isabella's information--but\nMiss Fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl, and he could talk\nto her. He had met her before breakfast as he was returning from a walk\nwith his little boys, when it had been just beginning to rain. It was\nnatural to have some civil hopes on the subject, and he said,\n\n“I hope you did not venture far, Miss Fairfax, this morning, or I am\nsure you must have been wet.--We scarcely got home in time. I hope you\nturned directly.”\n\n“I went only to the post-office,” said she, “and reached home before the\nrain was much. It is my daily errand. I always fetch the letters when\nI am here. It saves trouble, and is a something to get me out. A walk\nbefore breakfast does me good.”\n\n“Not a walk in the rain, I should imagine.”\n\n“No, but it did not absolutely rain when I set out.”\n\nMr. John Knightley smiled, and replied,\n\n“That is to say, you chose to have your walk, for you were not six yards\nfrom your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you; and Henry\nand John had seen more drops than they could count long before. The\npost-office has a great charm at one period of our lives. When you have\nlived to my age, you will begin to think letters are never worth going\nthrough the rain for.”\n\nThere was a little blush, and then this answer,\n\n“I must not hope to be ever situated as you are, in the midst of every\ndearest connexion, and therefore I cannot expect that simply growing\nolder should make me indifferent about letters.”\n\n“Indifferent! Oh! no--I never conceived you could become indifferent.\nLetters are no matter of indifference; they are generally a very\npositive curse.”\n\n“You are speaking of letters of business; mine are letters of\nfriendship.”\n\n“I have often thought them the worst of the two,” replied he coolly.\n“Business, you know, may bring money, but friendship hardly ever does.”\n\n“Ah! you are not serious now. I know Mr. John Knightley too well--I am\nvery sure he understands the value of friendship as well as any body. I\ncan easily believe that letters are very little to you, much less than\nto me, but it is not your being ten years older than myself which\nmakes the difference, it is not age, but situation. You have every\nbody dearest to you always at hand, I, probably, never shall again;\nand therefore till I have outlived all my affections, a post-office,\nI think, must always have power to draw me out, in worse weather than\nto-day.”\n\n“When I talked of your being altered by time, by the progress of years,”\n said John Knightley, “I meant to imply the change of situation which\ntime usually brings. I consider one as including the other. Time will\ngenerally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the daily\ncircle--but that is not the change I had in view for you. As an old\nfriend, you will allow me to hope, Miss Fairfax, that ten years hence\nyou may have as many concentrated objects as I have.”\n\nIt was kindly said, and very far from giving offence. A pleasant “thank\nyou” seemed meant to laugh it off, but a blush, a quivering lip, a tear\nin the eye, shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh. Her attention was\nnow claimed by Mr. Woodhouse, who being, according to his custom on such\noccasions, making the circle of his guests, and paying his particular\ncompliments to the ladies, was ending with her--and with all his mildest\nurbanity, said,\n\n“I am very sorry to hear, Miss Fairfax, of your being out this morning\nin the rain. Young ladies should take care of themselves.--Young ladies\nare delicate plants. They should take care of their health and their\ncomplexion. My dear, did you change your stockings?”\n\n“Yes, sir, I did indeed; and I am very much obliged by your kind\nsolicitude about me.”\n\n“My dear Miss Fairfax, young ladies are very sure to be cared for.--I\nhope your good grand-mama and aunt are well. They are some of my very\nold friends. I wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour. You\ndo us a great deal of honour to-day, I am sure. My daughter and I\nare both highly sensible of your goodness, and have the greatest\nsatisfaction in seeing you at Hartfield.”\n\nThe kind-hearted, polite old man might then sit down and feel that he\nhad done his duty, and made every fair lady welcome and easy.\n\nBy this time, the walk in the rain had reached Mrs. Elton, and her\nremonstrances now opened upon Jane.\n\n“My dear Jane, what is this I hear?--Going to the post-office in the\nrain!--This must not be, I assure you.--You sad girl, how could you do\nsuch a thing?--It is a sign I was not there to take care of you.”\n\nJane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold.\n\n“Oh! do not tell _me_. You really are a very sad girl, and do not know\nhow to take care of yourself.--To the post-office indeed! Mrs. Weston,\ndid you ever hear the like? You and I must positively exert our\nauthority.”\n\n“My advice,” said Mrs. Weston kindly and persuasively, “I certainly do\nfeel tempted to give. Miss Fairfax, you must not run such risks.--Liable\nas you have been to severe colds, indeed you ought to be particularly\ncareful, especially at this time of year. The spring I always think\nrequires more than common care. Better wait an hour or two, or even\nhalf a day for your letters, than run the risk of bringing on your cough\nagain. Now do not you feel that you had? Yes, I am sure you are much too\nreasonable. You look as if you would not do such a thing again.”\n\n“Oh! she _shall_ _not_ do such a thing again,” eagerly rejoined Mrs.\nElton. “We will not allow her to do such a thing again:”--and nodding\nsignificantly--“there must be some arrangement made, there must indeed.\nI shall speak to Mr. E. The man who fetches our letters every morning\n(one of our men, I forget his name) shall inquire for yours too and\nbring them to you. That will obviate all difficulties you know; and from\n_us_ I really think, my dear Jane, you can have no scruple to accept\nsuch an accommodation.”\n\n“You are extremely kind,” said Jane; “but I cannot give up my early\nwalk. I am advised to be out of doors as much as I can, I must walk\nsomewhere, and the post-office is an object; and upon my word, I have\nscarcely ever had a bad morning before.”\n\n“My dear Jane, say no more about it. The thing is determined, that is\n(laughing affectedly) as far as I can presume to determine any thing\nwithout the concurrence of my lord and master. You know, Mrs. Weston,\nyou and I must be cautious how we express ourselves. But I do flatter\nmyself, my dear Jane, that my influence is not entirely worn out. If I\nmeet with no insuperable difficulties therefore, consider that point as\nsettled.”\n\n“Excuse me,” said Jane earnestly, “I cannot by any means consent to such\nan arrangement, so needlessly troublesome to your servant. If the errand\nwere not a pleasure to me, it could be done, as it always is when I am\nnot here, by my grandmama's.”\n\n“Oh! my dear; but so much as Patty has to do!--And it is a kindness to\nemploy our men.”\n\nJane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered; but instead of\nanswering, she began speaking again to Mr. John Knightley.\n\n“The post-office is a wonderful establishment!” said she.--“The\nregularity and despatch of it! If one thinks of all that it has to do,\nand all that it does so well, it is really astonishing!”\n\n“It is certainly very well regulated.”\n\n“So seldom that any negligence or blunder appears! So seldom that\na letter, among the thousands that are constantly passing about the\nkingdom, is even carried wrong--and not one in a million, I suppose,\nactually lost! And when one considers the variety of hands, and of bad\nhands too, that are to be deciphered, it increases the wonder.”\n\n“The clerks grow expert from habit.--They must begin with some quickness\nof sight and hand, and exercise improves them. If you want any farther\nexplanation,” continued he, smiling, “they are paid for it. That is\nthe key to a great deal of capacity. The public pays and must be served\nwell.”\n\nThe varieties of handwriting were farther talked of, and the usual\nobservations made.\n\n“I have heard it asserted,” said John Knightley, “that the same sort\nof handwriting often prevails in a family; and where the same master\nteaches, it is natural enough. But for that reason, I should imagine\nthe likeness must be chiefly confined to the females, for boys have very\nlittle teaching after an early age, and scramble into any hand they can\nget. Isabella and Emma, I think, do write very much alike. I have not\nalways known their writing apart.”\n\n“Yes,” said his brother hesitatingly, “there is a likeness. I know what\nyou mean--but Emma's hand is the strongest.”\n\n“Isabella and Emma both write beautifully,” said Mr. Woodhouse; “and\nalways did. And so does poor Mrs. Weston”--with half a sigh and half a\nsmile at her.\n\n“I never saw any gentleman's handwriting”--Emma began, looking also at\nMrs. Weston; but stopped, on perceiving that Mrs. Weston was attending\nto some one else--and the pause gave her time to reflect, “Now, how am\nI going to introduce him?--Am I unequal to speaking his name at once\nbefore all these people? Is it necessary for me to use any roundabout\nphrase?--Your Yorkshire friend--your correspondent in Yorkshire;--that\nwould be the way, I suppose, if I were very bad.--No, I can pronounce\nhis name without the smallest distress. I certainly get better and\nbetter.--Now for it.”\n\nMrs. Weston was disengaged and Emma began again--“Mr. Frank Churchill\nwrites one of the best gentleman's hands I ever saw.”\n\n“I do not admire it,” said Mr. Knightley. “It is too small--wants\nstrength. It is like a woman's writing.”\n\nThis was not submitted to by either lady. They vindicated him against\nthe base aspersion. “No, it by no means wanted strength--it was not a\nlarge hand, but very clear and certainly strong. Had not Mrs. Weston any\nletter about her to produce?” No, she had heard from him very lately,\nbut having answered the letter, had put it away.\n\n“If we were in the other room,” said Emma, “if I had my writing-desk, I\nam sure I could produce a specimen. I have a note of his.--Do not you\nremember, Mrs. Weston, employing him to write for you one day?”\n\n“He chose to say he was employed”--\n\n“Well, well, I have that note; and can shew it after dinner to convince\nMr. Knightley.”\n\n“Oh! when a gallant young man, like Mr. Frank Churchill,” said Mr.\nKnightley dryly, “writes to a fair lady like Miss Woodhouse, he will, of\ncourse, put forth his best.”\n\nDinner was on table.--Mrs. Elton, before she could be spoken to, was\nready; and before Mr. Woodhouse had reached her with his request to be\nallowed to hand her into the dining-parlour, was saying--\n\n“Must I go first? I really am ashamed of always leading the way.”\n\nJane's solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped Emma.\nShe had heard and seen it all; and felt some curiosity to know whether\nthe wet walk of this morning had produced any. She suspected that it\n_had_; that it would not have been so resolutely encountered but in full\nexpectation of hearing from some one very dear, and that it had not been\nin vain. She thought there was an air of greater happiness than usual--a\nglow both of complexion and spirits.\n\nShe could have made an inquiry or two, as to the expedition and the\nexpense of the Irish mails;--it was at her tongue's end--but she\nabstained. She was quite determined not to utter a word that should hurt\nJane Fairfax's feelings; and they followed the other ladies out of the\nroom, arm in arm, with an appearance of good-will highly becoming to the\nbeauty and grace of each.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n\nWhen the ladies returned to the drawing-room after dinner, Emma found it\nhardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties;--with so\nmuch perseverance in judging and behaving ill did Mrs. Elton engross\nJane Fairfax and slight herself. She and Mrs. Weston were obliged to\nbe almost always either talking together or silent together. Mrs. Elton\nleft them no choice. If Jane repressed her for a little time, she\nsoon began again; and though much that passed between them was in a\nhalf-whisper, especially on Mrs. Elton's side, there was no avoiding\na knowledge of their principal subjects: The post-office--catching\ncold--fetching letters--and friendship, were long under discussion;\nand to them succeeded one, which must be at least equally unpleasant\nto Jane--inquiries whether she had yet heard of any situation likely to\nsuit her, and professions of Mrs. Elton's meditated activity.\n\n“Here is April come!” said she, “I get quite anxious about you. June\nwill soon be here.”\n\n“But I have never fixed on June or any other month--merely looked\nforward to the summer in general.”\n\n“But have you really heard of nothing?”\n\n“I have not even made any inquiry; I do not wish to make any yet.”\n\n“Oh! my dear, we cannot begin too early; you are not aware of the\ndifficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing.”\n\n“I not aware!” said Jane, shaking her head; “dear Mrs. Elton, who can\nhave thought of it as I have done?”\n\n“But you have not seen so much of the world as I have. You do not know\nhow many candidates there always are for the _first_ situations. I saw\na vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round Maple Grove. A cousin of\nMr. Suckling, Mrs. Bragge, had such an infinity of applications; every\nbody was anxious to be in her family, for she moves in the first circle.\nWax-candles in the schoolroom! You may imagine how desirable! Of all\nhouses in the kingdom Mrs. Bragge's is the one I would most wish to see\nyou in.”\n\n“Colonel and Mrs. Campbell are to be in town again by midsummer,”\n said Jane. “I must spend some time with them; I am sure they will want\nit;--afterwards I may probably be glad to dispose of myself. But I would\nnot wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries at present.”\n\n“Trouble! aye, I know your scruples. You are afraid of giving me\ntrouble; but I assure you, my dear Jane, the Campbells can hardly be\nmore interested about you than I am. I shall write to Mrs. Partridge in\na day or two, and shall give her a strict charge to be on the look-out\nfor any thing eligible.”\n\n“Thank you, but I would rather you did not mention the subject to\nher; till the time draws nearer, I do not wish to be giving any body\ntrouble.”\n\n“But, my dear child, the time is drawing near; here is April, and June,\nor say even July, is very near, with such business to accomplish before\nus. Your inexperience really amuses me! A situation such as you deserve,\nand your friends would require for you, is no everyday occurrence,\nis not obtained at a moment's notice; indeed, indeed, we must begin\ninquiring directly.”\n\n“Excuse me, ma'am, but this is by no means my intention; I make no\ninquiry myself, and should be sorry to have any made by my friends. When\nI am quite determined as to the time, I am not at all afraid of being\nlong unemployed. There are places in town, offices, where inquiry\nwould soon produce something--Offices for the sale--not quite of human\nflesh--but of human intellect.”\n\n“Oh! my dear, human flesh! You quite shock me; if you mean a fling at\nthe slave-trade, I assure you Mr. Suckling was always rather a friend to\nthe abolition.”\n\n“I did not mean, I was not thinking of the slave-trade,” replied Jane;\n“governess-trade, I assure you, was all that I had in view; widely\ndifferent certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on; but as to\nthe greater misery of the victims, I do not know where it lies. But\nI only mean to say that there are advertising offices, and that by\napplying to them I should have no doubt of very soon meeting with\nsomething that would do.”\n\n“Something that would do!” repeated Mrs. Elton. “Aye, _that_ may suit\nyour humble ideas of yourself;--I know what a modest creature you are;\nbut it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any\nthing that may offer, any inferior, commonplace situation, in a family\nnot moving in a certain circle, or able to command the elegancies of\nlife.”\n\n“You are very obliging; but as to all that, I am very indifferent;\nit would be no object to me to be with the rich; my mortifications, I\nthink, would only be the greater; I should suffer more from comparison.\nA gentleman's family is all that I should condition for.”\n\n“I know you, I know you; you would take up with any thing; but I shall\nbe a little more nice, and I am sure the good Campbells will be quite\non my side; with your superior talents, you have a right to move in the\nfirst circle. Your musical knowledge alone would entitle you to name\nyour own terms, have as many rooms as you like, and mix in the family\nas much as you chose;--that is--I do not know--if you knew the harp, you\nmight do all that, I am very sure; but you sing as well as play;--yes, I\nreally believe you might, even without the harp, stipulate for what\nyou chose;--and you must and shall be delightfully, honourably and\ncomfortably settled before the Campbells or I have any rest.”\n\n“You may well class the delight, the honour, and the comfort of such\na situation together,” said Jane, “they are pretty sure to be equal;\nhowever, I am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted\nat present for me. I am exceedingly obliged to you, Mrs. Elton, I am\nobliged to any body who feels for me, but I am quite serious in wishing\nnothing to be done till the summer. For two or three months longer I\nshall remain where I am, and as I am.”\n\n“And I am quite serious too, I assure you,” replied Mrs. Elton gaily,\n“in resolving to be always on the watch, and employing my friends to\nwatch also, that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us.”\n\nIn this style she ran on; never thoroughly stopped by any thing till Mr.\nWoodhouse came into the room; her vanity had then a change of object,\nand Emma heard her saying in the same half-whisper to Jane,\n\n“Here comes this dear old beau of mine, I protest!--Only think of his\ngallantry in coming away before the other men!--what a dear creature\nhe is;--I assure you I like him excessively. I admire all that quaint,\nold-fashioned politeness; it is much more to my taste than modern ease;\nmodern ease often disgusts me. But this good old Mr. Woodhouse, I wish\nyou had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner. Oh! I assure you I\nbegan to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous. I fancy I\nam rather a favourite; he took notice of my gown. How do you like\nit?--Selina's choice--handsome, I think, but I do not know whether it\nis not over-trimmed; I have the greatest dislike to the idea of being\nover-trimmed--quite a horror of finery. I must put on a few ornaments\nnow, because it is expected of me. A bride, you know, must appear like\na bride, but my natural taste is all for simplicity; a simple style\nof dress is so infinitely preferable to finery. But I am quite in the\nminority, I believe; few people seem to value simplicity of dress,--show\nand finery are every thing. I have some notion of putting such a\ntrimming as this to my white and silver poplin. Do you think it will\nlook well?”\n\nThe whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing-room when Mr.\nWeston made his appearance among them. He had returned to a late dinner,\nand walked to Hartfield as soon as it was over. He had been too much\nexpected by the best judges, for surprize--but there was great joy. Mr.\nWoodhouse was almost as glad to see him now, as he would have been sorry\nto see him before. John Knightley only was in mute astonishment.--That\na man who might have spent his evening quietly at home after a day\nof business in London, should set off again, and walk half a mile\nto another man's house, for the sake of being in mixed company till\nbed-time, of finishing his day in the efforts of civility and the noise\nof numbers, was a circumstance to strike him deeply. A man who had been\nin motion since eight o'clock in the morning, and might now have been\nstill, who had been long talking, and might have been silent, who had\nbeen in more than one crowd, and might have been alone!--Such a man, to\nquit the tranquillity and independence of his own fireside, and on the\nevening of a cold sleety April day rush out again into the world!--Could\nhe by a touch of his finger have instantly taken back his wife, there\nwould have been a motive; but his coming would probably prolong rather\nthan break up the party. John Knightley looked at him with amazement,\nthen shrugged his shoulders, and said, “I could not have believed it\neven of _him_.”\n\nMr. Weston meanwhile, perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation he was\nexciting, happy and cheerful as usual, and with all the right of being\nprincipal talker, which a day spent anywhere from home confers, was\nmaking himself agreeable among the rest; and having satisfied the\ninquiries of his wife as to his dinner, convincing her that none of all\nher careful directions to the servants had been forgotten, and spread\nabroad what public news he had heard, was proceeding to a family\ncommunication, which, though principally addressed to Mrs. Weston, he\nhad not the smallest doubt of being highly interesting to every body in\nthe room. He gave her a letter, it was from Frank, and to herself; he\nhad met with it in his way, and had taken the liberty of opening it.\n\n“Read it, read it,” said he, “it will give you pleasure; only a few\nlines--will not take you long; read it to Emma.”\n\nThe two ladies looked over it together; and he sat smiling and talking\nto them the whole time, in a voice a little subdued, but very audible to\nevery body.\n\n“Well, he is coming, you see; good news, I think. Well, what do you say\nto it?--I always told you he would be here again soon, did not I?--Anne,\nmy dear, did not I always tell you so, and you would not believe me?--In\ntown next week, you see--at the latest, I dare say; for _she_ is as\nimpatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done; most\nlikely they will be there to-morrow or Saturday. As to her illness, all\nnothing of course. But it is an excellent thing to have Frank among us\nagain, so near as town. They will stay a good while when they do come,\nand he will be half his time with us. This is precisely what I wanted.\nWell, pretty good news, is not it? Have you finished it? Has Emma read\nit all? Put it up, put it up; we will have a good talk about it some\nother time, but it will not do now. I shall only just mention the\ncircumstance to the others in a common way.”\n\nMrs. Weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion. Her looks\nand words had nothing to restrain them. She was happy, she knew she was\nhappy, and knew she ought to be happy. Her congratulations were warm and\nopen; but Emma could not speak so fluently. _She_ was a little occupied\nin weighing her own feelings, and trying to understand the degree of her\nagitation, which she rather thought was considerable.\n\nMr. Weston, however, too eager to be very observant, too communicative\nto want others to talk, was very well satisfied with what she did say,\nand soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial\ncommunication of what the whole room must have overheard already.\n\nIt was well that he took every body's joy for granted, or he might\nnot have thought either Mr. Woodhouse or Mr. Knightley particularly\ndelighted. They were the first entitled, after Mrs. Weston and Emma, to\nbe made happy;--from them he would have proceeded to Miss Fairfax, but\nshe was so deep in conversation with John Knightley, that it would have\nbeen too positive an interruption; and finding himself close to Mrs.\nElton, and her attention disengaged, he necessarily began on the subject\nwith her.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n\n“I hope I shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you,”\n said Mr. Weston.\n\nMrs. Elton, very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended her\nby such a hope, smiled most graciously.\n\n“You have heard of a certain Frank Churchill, I presume,” he\ncontinued--“and know him to be my son, though he does not bear my name.”\n\n“Oh! yes, and I shall be very happy in his acquaintance. I am sure Mr.\nElton will lose no time in calling on him; and we shall both have great\npleasure in seeing him at the Vicarage.”\n\n“You are very obliging.--Frank will be extremely happy, I am sure.--\nHe is to be in town next week, if not sooner. We have notice of it in a\nletter to-day. I met the letters in my way this morning, and seeing my\nson's hand, presumed to open it--though it was not directed to me--it\nwas to Mrs. Weston. She is his principal correspondent, I assure you. I\nhardly ever get a letter.”\n\n“And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her! Oh! Mr.\nWeston--(laughing affectedly) I must protest against that.--A most\ndangerous precedent indeed!--I beg you will not let your neighbours\nfollow your example.--Upon my word, if this is what I am to expect, we\nmarried women must begin to exert ourselves!--Oh! Mr. Weston, I could\nnot have believed it of you!”\n\n“Aye, we men are sad fellows. You must take care of yourself, Mrs.\nElton.--This letter tells us--it is a short letter--written in a hurry,\nmerely to give us notice--it tells us that they are all coming up to\ntown directly, on Mrs. Churchill's account--she has not been well the\nwhole winter, and thinks Enscombe too cold for her--so they are all to\nmove southward without loss of time.”\n\n“Indeed!--from Yorkshire, I think. Enscombe is in Yorkshire?”\n\n“Yes, they are about one hundred and ninety miles from London, a\nconsiderable journey.”\n\n“Yes, upon my word, very considerable. Sixty-five miles farther than\nfrom Maple Grove to London. But what is distance, Mr. Weston, to people\nof large fortune?--You would be amazed to hear how my brother, Mr.\nSuckling, sometimes flies about. You will hardly believe me--but twice\nin one week he and Mr. Bragge went to London and back again with four\nhorses.”\n\n“The evil of the distance from Enscombe,” said Mr. Weston, “is, that\nMrs. Churchill, _as_ _we_ _understand_, has not been able to leave the\nsofa for a week together. In Frank's last letter she complained, he\nsaid, of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having\nboth his arm and his uncle's! This, you know, speaks a great degree of\nweakness--but now she is so impatient to be in town, that she means to\nsleep only two nights on the road.--So Frank writes word. Certainly,\ndelicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions, Mrs. Elton. You\nmust grant me that.”\n\n“No, indeed, I shall grant you nothing. I always take the part of my\nown sex. I do indeed. I give you notice--You will find me a formidable\nantagonist on that point. I always stand up for women--and I assure you,\nif you knew how Selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn, you\nwould not wonder at Mrs. Churchill's making incredible exertions to\navoid it. Selina says it is quite horror to her--and I believe I have\ncaught a little of her nicety. She always travels with her own sheets;\nan excellent precaution. Does Mrs. Churchill do the same?”\n\n“Depend upon it, Mrs. Churchill does every thing that any other fine\nlady ever did. Mrs. Churchill will not be second to any lady in the land\nfor”--\n\nMrs. Elton eagerly interposed with,\n\n“Oh! Mr. Weston, do not mistake me. Selina is no fine lady, I assure\nyou. Do not run away with such an idea.”\n\n“Is not she? Then she is no rule for Mrs. Churchill, who is as thorough\na fine lady as any body ever beheld.”\n\nMrs. Elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly.\nIt was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister was\n_not_ a fine lady; perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence of\nit;--and she was considering in what way she had best retract, when Mr.\nWeston went on.\n\n“Mrs. Churchill is not much in my good graces, as you may suspect--but\nthis is quite between ourselves. She is very fond of Frank, and\ntherefore I would not speak ill of her. Besides, she is out of health\nnow; but _that_ indeed, by her own account, she has always been. I would\nnot say so to every body, Mrs. Elton, but I have not much faith in Mrs.\nChurchill's illness.”\n\n“If she is really ill, why not go to Bath, Mr. Weston?--To Bath, or to\nClifton?” “She has taken it into her head that Enscombe is too cold for\nher. The fact is, I suppose, that she is tired of Enscombe. She has now\nbeen a longer time stationary there, than she ever was before, and she\nbegins to want change. It is a retired place. A fine place, but very\nretired.”\n\n“Aye--like Maple Grove, I dare say. Nothing can stand more retired from\nthe road than Maple Grove. Such an immense plantation all round it! You\nseem shut out from every thing--in the most complete retirement.--And\nMrs. Churchill probably has not health or spirits like Selina to enjoy\nthat sort of seclusion. Or, perhaps she may not have resources enough in\nherself to be qualified for a country life. I always say a woman cannot\nhave too many resources--and I feel very thankful that I have so many\nmyself as to be quite independent of society.”\n\n“Frank was here in February for a fortnight.”\n\n“So I remember to have heard. He will find an _addition_ to the society\nof Highbury when he comes again; that is, if I may presume to call\nmyself an addition. But perhaps he may never have heard of there being\nsuch a creature in the world.”\n\nThis was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by, and Mr.\nWeston, with a very good grace, immediately exclaimed,\n\n“My dear madam! Nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing possible.\nNot heard of you!--I believe Mrs. Weston's letters lately have been full\nof very little else than Mrs. Elton.”\n\nHe had done his duty and could return to his son.\n\n“When Frank left us,” continued he, “it was quite uncertain when we\nmight see him again, which makes this day's news doubly welcome. It has\nbeen completely unexpected. That is, _I_ always had a strong persuasion\nhe would be here again soon, I was sure something favourable would turn\nup--but nobody believed me. He and Mrs. Weston were both dreadfully\ndesponding. 'How could he contrive to come? And how could it be supposed\nthat his uncle and aunt would spare him again?' and so forth--I always\nfelt that something would happen in our favour; and so it has, you see.\nI have observed, Mrs. Elton, in the course of my life, that if things\nare going untowardly one month, they are sure to mend the next.”\n\n“Very true, Mr. Weston, perfectly true. It is just what I used to say to\na certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship, when, because\nthings did not go quite right, did not proceed with all the rapidity\nwhich suited his feelings, he was apt to be in despair, and exclaim that\nhe was sure at this rate it would be _May_ before Hymen's saffron robe\nwould be put on for us. Oh! the pains I have been at to dispel those\ngloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views! The carriage--we had\ndisappointments about the carriage;--one morning, I remember, he came to\nme quite in despair.”\n\nShe was stopped by a slight fit of coughing, and Mr. Weston instantly\nseized the opportunity of going on.\n\n“You were mentioning May. May is the very month which Mrs. Churchill\nis ordered, or has ordered herself, to spend in some warmer place than\nEnscombe--in short, to spend in London; so that we have the agreeable\nprospect of frequent visits from Frank the whole spring--precisely the\nseason of the year which one should have chosen for it: days almost at\nthe longest; weather genial and pleasant, always inviting one out, and\nnever too hot for exercise. When he was here before, we made the best\nof it; but there was a good deal of wet, damp, cheerless weather;\nthere always is in February, you know, and we could not do half that we\nintended. Now will be the time. This will be complete enjoyment; and I\ndo not know, Mrs. Elton, whether the uncertainty of our meetings, the\nsort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in to-day or\nto-morrow, and at any hour, may not be more friendly to happiness than\nhaving him actually in the house. I think it is so. I think it is the\nstate of mind which gives most spirit and delight. I hope you will be\npleased with my son; but you must not expect a prodigy. He is generally\nthought a fine young man, but do not expect a prodigy. Mrs. Weston's\npartiality for him is very great, and, as you may suppose, most\ngratifying to me. She thinks nobody equal to him.”\n\n“And I assure you, Mr. Weston, I have very little doubt that my opinion\nwill be decidedly in his favour. I have heard so much in praise of Mr.\nFrank Churchill.--At the same time it is fair to observe, that I am one\nof those who always judge for themselves, and are by no means implicitly\nguided by others. I give you notice that as I find your son, so I shall\njudge of him.--I am no flatterer.”\n\nMr. Weston was musing.\n\n“I hope,” said he presently, “I have not been severe upon poor Mrs.\nChurchill. If she is ill I should be sorry to do her injustice; but\nthere are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me to\nspeak of her with the forbearance I could wish. You cannot be ignorant,\nMrs. Elton, of my connexion with the family, nor of the treatment I have\nmet with; and, between ourselves, the whole blame of it is to be laid\nto her. She was the instigator. Frank's mother would never have been\nslighted as she was but for her. Mr. Churchill has pride; but his pride\nis nothing to his wife's: his is a quiet, indolent, gentlemanlike sort\nof pride that would harm nobody, and only make himself a little helpless\nand tiresome; but her pride is arrogance and insolence! And what\ninclines one less to bear, she has no fair pretence of family or blood.\nShe was nobody when he married her, barely the daughter of a gentleman;\nbut ever since her being turned into a Churchill she has out-Churchill'd\nthem all in high and mighty claims: but in herself, I assure you, she is\nan upstart.”\n\n“Only think! well, that must be infinitely provoking! I have quite\na horror of upstarts. Maple Grove has given me a thorough disgust to\npeople of that sort; for there is a family in that neighbourhood who\nare such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs they give\nthemselves! Your description of Mrs. Churchill made me think of them\ndirectly. People of the name of Tupman, very lately settled there, and\nencumbered with many low connexions, but giving themselves immense airs,\nand expecting to be on a footing with the old established families.\nA year and a half is the very utmost that they can have lived at West\nHall; and how they got their fortune nobody knows. They came from\nBirmingham, which is not a place to promise much, you know, Mr. Weston.\nOne has not great hopes from Birmingham. I always say there is something\ndireful in the sound: but nothing more is positively known of the\nTupmans, though a good many things I assure you are suspected; and\nyet by their manners they evidently think themselves equal even to\nmy brother, Mr. Suckling, who happens to be one of their nearest\nneighbours. It is infinitely too bad. Mr. Suckling, who has been eleven\nyears a resident at Maple Grove, and whose father had it before him--I\nbelieve, at least--I am almost sure that old Mr. Suckling had completed\nthe purchase before his death.”\n\nThey were interrupted. Tea was carrying round, and Mr. Weston, having\nsaid all that he wanted, soon took the opportunity of walking away.\n\nAfter tea, Mr. and Mrs. Weston, and Mr. Elton sat down with Mr.\nWoodhouse to cards. The remaining five were left to their own powers,\nand Emma doubted their getting on very well; for Mr. Knightley seemed\nlittle disposed for conversation; Mrs. Elton was wanting notice, which\nnobody had inclination to pay, and she was herself in a worry of spirits\nwhich would have made her prefer being silent.\n\nMr. John Knightley proved more talkative than his brother. He was to\nleave them early the next day; and he soon began with--\n\n“Well, Emma, I do not believe I have any thing more to say about the\nboys; but you have your sister's letter, and every thing is down at full\nlength there we may be sure. My charge would be much more concise than\nher's, and probably not much in the same spirit; all that I have to\nrecommend being comprised in, do not spoil them, and do not physic\nthem.”\n\n“I rather hope to satisfy you both,” said Emma, “for I shall do all\nin my power to make them happy, which will be enough for Isabella; and\nhappiness must preclude false indulgence and physic.”\n\n“And if you find them troublesome, you must send them home again.”\n\n“That is very likely. You think so, do not you?”\n\n“I hope I am aware that they may be too noisy for your father--or even\nmay be some encumbrance to you, if your visiting engagements continue to\nincrease as much as they have done lately.”\n\n“Increase!”\n\n“Certainly; you must be sensible that the last half-year has made a\ngreat difference in your way of life.”\n\n“Difference! No indeed I am not.”\n\n“There can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company than\nyou used to be. Witness this very time. Here am I come down for only\none day, and you are engaged with a dinner-party!--When did it happen\nbefore, or any thing like it? Your neighbourhood is increasing, and you\nmix more with it. A little while ago, every letter to Isabella brought\nan account of fresh gaieties; dinners at Mr. Cole's, or balls at the\nCrown. The difference which Randalls, Randalls alone makes in your\ngoings-on, is very great.”\n\n“Yes,” said his brother quickly, “it is Randalls that does it all.”\n\n“Very well--and as Randalls, I suppose, is not likely to have less\ninfluence than heretofore, it strikes me as a possible thing, Emma, that\nHenry and John may be sometimes in the way. And if they are, I only beg\nyou to send them home.”\n\n“No,” cried Mr. Knightley, “that need not be the consequence. Let them\nbe sent to Donwell. I shall certainly be at leisure.”\n\n“Upon my word,” exclaimed Emma, “you amuse me! I should like to know how\nmany of all my numerous engagements take place without your being of\nthe party; and why I am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure to\nattend to the little boys. These amazing engagements of mine--what have\nthey been? Dining once with the Coles--and having a ball talked of,\nwhich never took place. I can understand you--(nodding at Mr. John\nKnightley)--your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at\nonce here, delights you too much to pass unnoticed. But you, (turning to\nMr. Knightley,) who know how very, very seldom I am ever two hours from\nHartfield, why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me, I\ncannot imagine. And as to my dear little boys, I must say, that if Aunt\nEmma has not time for them, I do not think they would fare much better\nwith Uncle Knightley, who is absent from home about five hours where she\nis absent one--and who, when he is at home, is either reading to himself\nor settling his accounts.”\n\nMr. Knightley seemed to be trying not to smile; and succeeded without\ndifficulty, upon Mrs. Elton's beginning to talk to him.\n\n\n\n\nVOLUME III\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nA very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy Emma as to the\nnature of her agitation on hearing this news of Frank Churchill. She\nwas soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at all\napprehensive or embarrassed; it was for him. Her own attachment had\nreally subsided into a mere nothing; it was not worth thinking of;--but\nif he, who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love of the\ntwo, were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment which he had\ntaken away, it would be very distressing. If a separation of two\nmonths should not have cooled him, there were dangers and evils before\nher:--caution for him and for herself would be necessary. She did\nnot mean to have her own affections entangled again, and it would be\nincumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his.\n\nShe wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration.\nThat would be so very painful a conclusion of their present\nacquaintance! and yet, she could not help rather anticipating something\ndecisive. She felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a\ncrisis, an event, a something to alter her present composed and tranquil\nstate.\n\nIt was not very long, though rather longer than Mr. Weston had foreseen,\nbefore she had the power of forming some opinion of Frank Churchill's\nfeelings. The Enscombe family were not in town quite so soon as had been\nimagined, but he was at Highbury very soon afterwards. He rode down\nfor a couple of hours; he could not yet do more; but as he came from\nRandalls immediately to Hartfield, she could then exercise all her quick\nobservation, and speedily determine how he was influenced, and how she\nmust act. They met with the utmost friendliness. There could be no doubt\nof his great pleasure in seeing her. But she had an almost instant doubt\nof his caring for her as he had done, of his feeling the same tenderness\nin the same degree. She watched him well. It was a clear thing he was\nless in love than he had been. Absence, with the conviction probably\nof her indifference, had produced this very natural and very desirable\neffect.\n\nHe was in high spirits; as ready to talk and laugh as ever, and seemed\ndelighted to speak of his former visit, and recur to old stories: and he\nwas not without agitation. It was not in his calmness that she read\nhis comparative difference. He was not calm; his spirits were evidently\nfluttered; there was restlessness about him. Lively as he was, it seemed\na liveliness that did not satisfy himself; but what decided her belief\non the subject, was his staying only a quarter of an hour, and hurrying\naway to make other calls in Highbury. “He had seen a group of old\nacquaintance in the street as he passed--he had not stopped, he would\nnot stop for more than a word--but he had the vanity to think they would\nbe disappointed if he did not call, and much as he wished to stay longer\nat Hartfield, he must hurry off.” She had no doubt as to his being less\nin love--but neither his agitated spirits, nor his hurrying away, seemed\nlike a perfect cure; and she was rather inclined to think it implied a\ndread of her returning power, and a discreet resolution of not trusting\nhimself with her long.\n\nThis was the only visit from Frank Churchill in the course of ten days.\nHe was often hoping, intending to come--but was always prevented. His\naunt could not bear to have him leave her. Such was his own account at\nRandall's. If he were quite sincere, if he really tried to come, it was\nto be inferred that Mrs. Churchill's removal to London had been of no\nservice to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder. That she was\nreally ill was very certain; he had declared himself convinced of it, at\nRandalls. Though much might be fancy, he could not doubt, when he looked\nback, that she was in a weaker state of health than she had been half a\nyear ago. He did not believe it to proceed from any thing that care\nand medicine might not remove, or at least that she might not have many\nyears of existence before her; but he could not be prevailed on, by all\nhis father's doubts, to say that her complaints were merely imaginary,\nor that she was as strong as ever.\n\nIt soon appeared that London was not the place for her. She could\nnot endure its noise. Her nerves were under continual irritation and\nsuffering; and by the ten days' end, her nephew's letter to Randalls\ncommunicated a change of plan. They were going to remove immediately to\nRichmond. Mrs. Churchill had been recommended to the medical skill of\nan eminent person there, and had otherwise a fancy for the place. A\nready-furnished house in a favourite spot was engaged, and much benefit\nexpected from the change.\n\nEmma heard that Frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement,\nand seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two months\nbefore him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends--for the\nhouse was taken for May and June. She was told that now he wrote with\nthe greatest confidence of being often with them, almost as often as he\ncould even wish.\n\nEmma saw how Mr. Weston understood these joyous prospects. He was\nconsidering her as the source of all the happiness they offered. She\nhoped it was not so. Two months must bring it to the proof.\n\nMr. Weston's own happiness was indisputable. He was quite delighted.\nIt was the very circumstance he could have wished for. Now, it would be\nreally having Frank in their neighbourhood. What were nine miles to\na young man?--An hour's ride. He would be always coming over. The\ndifference in that respect of Richmond and London was enough to make\nthe whole difference of seeing him always and seeing him never. Sixteen\nmiles--nay, eighteen--it must be full eighteen to Manchester-street--was\na serious obstacle. Were he ever able to get away, the day would be\nspent in coming and returning. There was no comfort in having him in\nLondon; he might as well be at Enscombe; but Richmond was the very\ndistance for easy intercourse. Better than nearer!\n\nOne good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this\nremoval,--the ball at the Crown. It had not been forgotten before,\nbut it had been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day. Now,\nhowever, it was absolutely to be; every preparation was resumed, and\nvery soon after the Churchills had removed to Richmond, a few lines from\nFrank, to say that his aunt felt already much better for the change, and\nthat he had no doubt of being able to join them for twenty-four hours at\nany given time, induced them to name as early a day as possible.\n\nMr. Weston's ball was to be a real thing. A very few to-morrows stood\nbetween the young people of Highbury and happiness.\n\nMr. Woodhouse was resigned. The time of year lightened the evil to him.\nMay was better for every thing than February. Mrs. Bates was engaged to\nspend the evening at Hartfield, James had due notice, and he sanguinely\nhoped that neither dear little Henry nor dear little John would have any\nthing the matter with them, while dear Emma were gone.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nNo misfortune occurred, again to prevent the ball. The day approached,\nthe day arrived; and after a morning of some anxious watching, Frank\nChurchill, in all the certainty of his own self, reached Randalls before\ndinner, and every thing was safe.\n\nNo second meeting had there yet been between him and Emma. The room\nat the Crown was to witness it;--but it would be better than a\ncommon meeting in a crowd. Mr. Weston had been so very earnest in his\nentreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves,\nfor the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort of\nthe rooms before any other persons came, that she could not refuse him,\nand must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man's company.\nShe was to convey Harriet, and they drove to the Crown in good time, the\nRandalls party just sufficiently before them.\n\nFrank Churchill seemed to have been on the watch; and though he did not\nsay much, his eyes declared that he meant to have a delightful evening.\nThey all walked about together, to see that every thing was as it should\nbe; and within a few minutes were joined by the contents of another\ncarriage, which Emma could not hear the sound of at first, without great\nsurprize. “So unreasonably early!” she was going to exclaim; but she\npresently found that it was a family of old friends, who were coming,\nlike herself, by particular desire, to help Mr. Weston's judgment; and\nthey were so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins,\nwho had been entreated to come early with the same distinguishing\nearnestness, on the same errand, that it seemed as if half the company\nmight soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory\ninspection.\n\nEmma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which Mr. Weston\ndepended, and felt, that to be the favourite and intimate of a man\nwho had so many intimates and confidantes, was not the very first\ndistinction in the scale of vanity. She liked his open manners, but\na little less of open-heartedness would have made him a higher\ncharacter.--General benevolence, but not general friendship, made a\nman what he ought to be.--She could fancy such a man. The whole party\nwalked about, and looked, and praised again; and then, having nothing\nelse to do, formed a sort of half-circle round the fire, to observe\nin their various modes, till other subjects were started, that, though\n_May_, a fire in the evening was still very pleasant.\n\nEmma found that it was not Mr. Weston's fault that the number of privy\ncouncillors was not yet larger. They had stopped at Mrs. Bates's door\nto offer the use of their carriage, but the aunt and niece were to be\nbrought by the Eltons.\n\nFrank was standing by her, but not steadily; there was a restlessness,\nwhich shewed a mind not at ease. He was looking about, he was going to\nthe door, he was watching for the sound of other carriages,--impatient\nto begin, or afraid of being always near her.\n\nMrs. Elton was spoken of. “I think she must be here soon,” said he. “I\nhave a great curiosity to see Mrs. Elton, I have heard so much of her.\nIt cannot be long, I think, before she comes.”\n\nA carriage was heard. He was on the move immediately; but coming back,\nsaid,\n\n“I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her. I have never seen\neither Mr. or Mrs. Elton. I have no business to put myself forward.”\n\nMr. and Mrs. Elton appeared; and all the smiles and the proprieties\npassed.\n\n“But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax!” said Mr. Weston, looking about. “We\nthought you were to bring them.”\n\nThe mistake had been slight. The carriage was sent for them now. Emma\nlonged to know what Frank's first opinion of Mrs. Elton might be; how\nhe was affected by the studied elegance of her dress, and her smiles of\ngraciousness. He was immediately qualifying himself to form an opinion,\nby giving her very proper attention, after the introduction had passed.\n\nIn a few minutes the carriage returned.--Somebody talked of rain.--“I\nwill see that there are umbrellas, sir,” said Frank to his father:\n“Miss Bates must not be forgotten:” and away he went. Mr. Weston was\nfollowing; but Mrs. Elton detained him, to gratify him by her opinion\nof his son; and so briskly did she begin, that the young man himself,\nthough by no means moving slowly, could hardly be out of hearing.\n\n“A very fine young man indeed, Mr. Weston. You know I candidly told you\nI should form my own opinion; and I am happy to say that I am extremely\npleased with him.--You may believe me. I never compliment. I think him\na very handsome young man, and his manners are precisely what I like and\napprove--so truly the gentleman, without the least conceit or puppyism.\nYou must know I have a vast dislike to puppies--quite a horror of them.\nThey were never tolerated at Maple Grove. Neither Mr. Suckling nor\nme had ever any patience with them; and we used sometimes to say very\ncutting things! Selina, who is mild almost to a fault, bore with them\nmuch better.”\n\nWhile she talked of his son, Mr. Weston's attention was chained; but\nwhen she got to Maple Grove, he could recollect that there were ladies\njust arriving to be attended to, and with happy smiles must hurry away.\n\nMrs. Elton turned to Mrs. Weston. “I have no doubt of its being our\ncarriage with Miss Bates and Jane. Our coachman and horses are so\nextremely expeditious!--I believe we drive faster than any body.--What\na pleasure it is to send one's carriage for a friend!--I understand you\nwere so kind as to offer, but another time it will be quite unnecessary.\nYou may be very sure I shall always take care of _them_.”\n\nMiss Bates and Miss Fairfax, escorted by the two gentlemen, walked into\nthe room; and Mrs. Elton seemed to think it as much her duty as Mrs.\nWeston's to receive them. Her gestures and movements might be understood\nby any one who looked on like Emma; but her words, every body's words,\nwere soon lost under the incessant flow of Miss Bates, who came in\ntalking, and had not finished her speech under many minutes after her\nbeing admitted into the circle at the fire. As the door opened she was\nheard,\n\n“So very obliging of you!--No rain at all. Nothing to signify. I do not\ncare for myself. Quite thick shoes. And Jane declares--Well!--(as soon\nas she was within the door) Well! This is brilliant indeed!--This is\nadmirable!--Excellently contrived, upon my word. Nothing wanting. Could\nnot have imagined it.--So well lighted up!--Jane, Jane, look!--did you\never see any thing? Oh! Mr. Weston, you must really have had Aladdin's\nlamp. Good Mrs. Stokes would not know her own room again. I saw her as\nI came in; she was standing in the entrance. 'Oh! Mrs. Stokes,' said\nI--but I had not time for more.” She was now met by Mrs. Weston.--“Very\nwell, I thank you, ma'am. I hope you are quite well. Very happy to hear\nit. So afraid you might have a headache!--seeing you pass by so often,\nand knowing how much trouble you must have. Delighted to hear it indeed.\nAh! dear Mrs. Elton, so obliged to you for the carriage!--excellent\ntime. Jane and I quite ready. Did not keep the horses a moment. Most\ncomfortable carriage.--Oh! and I am sure our thanks are due to you,\nMrs. Weston, on that score. Mrs. Elton had most kindly sent Jane a note,\nor we should have been.--But two such offers in one day!--Never were\nsuch neighbours. I said to my mother, 'Upon my word, ma'am--.' Thank\nyou, my mother is remarkably well. Gone to Mr. Woodhouse's. I made her\ntake her shawl--for the evenings are not warm--her large new shawl--\nMrs. Dixon's wedding-present.--So kind of her to think of my mother!\nBought at Weymouth, you know--Mr. Dixon's choice. There were three\nothers, Jane says, which they hesitated about some time. Colonel\nCampbell rather preferred an olive. My dear Jane, are you sure you did\nnot wet your feet?--It was but a drop or two, but I am so afraid:--but\nMr. Frank Churchill was so extremely--and there was a mat to step\nupon--I shall never forget his extreme politeness.--Oh! Mr. Frank\nChurchill, I must tell you my mother's spectacles have never been in\nfault since; the rivet never came out again. My mother often talks of\nyour good-nature. Does not she, Jane?--Do not we often talk of Mr. Frank\nChurchill?--Ah! here's Miss Woodhouse.--Dear Miss Woodhouse, how do\nyou do?--Very well I thank you, quite well. This is meeting quite\nin fairy-land!--Such a transformation!--Must not compliment, I know\n(eyeing Emma most complacently)--that would be rude--but upon my word,\nMiss Woodhouse, you do look--how do you like Jane's hair?--You are\na judge.--She did it all herself. Quite wonderful how she does her\nhair!--No hairdresser from London I think could.--Ah! Dr. Hughes I\ndeclare--and Mrs. Hughes. Must go and speak to Dr. and Mrs. Hughes for a\nmoment.--How do you do? How do you do?--Very well, I thank you. This\nis delightful, is not it?--Where's dear Mr. Richard?--Oh! there he is.\nDon't disturb him. Much better employed talking to the young ladies. How\ndo you do, Mr. Richard?--I saw you the other day as you rode through\nthe town--Mrs. Otway, I protest!--and good Mr. Otway, and Miss Otway\nand Miss Caroline.--Such a host of friends!--and Mr. George and Mr.\nArthur!--How do you do? How do you all do?--Quite well, I am much\nobliged to you. Never better.--Don't I hear another carriage?--Who can\nthis be?--very likely the worthy Coles.--Upon my word, this is charming\nto be standing about among such friends! And such a noble fire!--I am\nquite roasted. No coffee, I thank you, for me--never take coffee.--A\nlittle tea if you please, sir, by and bye,--no hurry--Oh! here it comes.\nEvery thing so good!”\n\nFrank Churchill returned to his station by Emma; and as soon as Miss\nBates was quiet, she found herself necessarily overhearing the discourse\nof Mrs. Elton and Miss Fairfax, who were standing a little way behind\nher.--He was thoughtful. Whether he were overhearing too, she could not\ndetermine. After a good many compliments to Jane on her dress and look,\ncompliments very quietly and properly taken, Mrs. Elton was evidently\nwanting to be complimented herself--and it was, “How do you like\nmy gown?--How do you like my trimming?--How has Wright done my\nhair?”--with many other relative questions, all answered with patient\npoliteness. Mrs. Elton then said, “Nobody can think less of dress in\ngeneral than I do--but upon such an occasion as this, when every body's\neyes are so much upon me, and in compliment to the Westons--who I have\nno doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour--I would not wish\nto be inferior to others. And I see very few pearls in the room except\nmine.--So Frank Churchill is a capital dancer, I understand.--We shall\nsee if our styles suit.--A fine young man certainly is Frank Churchill.\nI like him very well.”\n\nAt this moment Frank began talking so vigorously, that Emma could not\nbut imagine he had overheard his own praises, and did not want to hear\nmore;--and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while, till\nanother suspension brought Mrs. Elton's tones again distinctly\nforward.--Mr. Elton had just joined them, and his wife was exclaiming,\n\n“Oh! you have found us out at last, have you, in our seclusion?--I was\nthis moment telling Jane, I thought you would begin to be impatient for\ntidings of us.”\n\n“Jane!”--repeated Frank Churchill, with a look of surprize and\ndispleasure.--“That is easy--but Miss Fairfax does not disapprove it, I\nsuppose.”\n\n“How do you like Mrs. Elton?” said Emma in a whisper.\n\n“Not at all.”\n\n“You are ungrateful.”\n\n“Ungrateful!--What do you mean?” Then changing from a frown to a\nsmile--“No, do not tell me--I do not want to know what you mean.--Where\nis my father?--When are we to begin dancing?”\n\nEmma could hardly understand him; he seemed in an odd humour. He walked\noff to find his father, but was quickly back again with both Mr. and\nMrs. Weston. He had met with them in a little perplexity, which must be\nlaid before Emma. It had just occurred to Mrs. Weston that Mrs. Elton\nmust be asked to begin the ball; that she would expect it; which\ninterfered with all their wishes of giving Emma that distinction.--Emma\nheard the sad truth with fortitude.\n\n“And what are we to do for a proper partner for her?” said Mr. Weston.\n“She will think Frank ought to ask her.”\n\nFrank turned instantly to Emma, to claim her former promise; and\nboasted himself an engaged man, which his father looked his most perfect\napprobation of--and it then appeared that Mrs. Weston was wanting _him_\nto dance with Mrs. Elton himself, and that their business was to help to\npersuade him into it, which was done pretty soon.--Mr. Weston and Mrs.\nElton led the way, Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse followed.\nEmma must submit to stand second to Mrs. Elton, though she had always\nconsidered the ball as peculiarly for her. It was almost enough to make\nher think of marrying. Mrs. Elton had undoubtedly the advantage, at this\ntime, in vanity completely gratified; for though she had intended to\nbegin with Frank Churchill, she could not lose by the change. Mr. Weston\nmight be his son's superior.--In spite of this little rub, however,\nEmma was smiling with enjoyment, delighted to see the respectable length\nof the set as it was forming, and to feel that she had so many hours\nof unusual festivity before her.--She was more disturbed by Mr.\nKnightley's not dancing than by any thing else.--There he was, among\nthe standers-by, where he ought not to be; he ought to be dancing,--not\nclassing himself with the husbands, and fathers, and whist-players, who\nwere pretending to feel an interest in the dance till their rubbers were\nmade up,--so young as he looked!--He could not have appeared to greater\nadvantage perhaps anywhere, than where he had placed himself. His tall,\nfirm, upright figure, among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of\nthe elderly men, was such as Emma felt must draw every body's eyes;\nand, excepting her own partner, there was not one among the whole row of\nyoung men who could be compared with him.--He moved a few steps nearer,\nand those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner,\nwith what natural grace, he must have danced, would he but take the\ntrouble.--Whenever she caught his eye, she forced him to smile; but\nin general he was looking grave. She wished he could love a ballroom\nbetter, and could like Frank Churchill better.--He seemed often\nobserving her. She must not flatter herself that he thought of her\ndancing, but if he were criticising her behaviour, she did not feel\nafraid. There was nothing like flirtation between her and her partner.\nThey seemed more like cheerful, easy friends, than lovers. That Frank\nChurchill thought less of her than he had done, was indubitable.\n\nThe ball proceeded pleasantly. The anxious cares, the incessant\nattentions of Mrs. Weston, were not thrown away. Every body seemed\nhappy; and the praise of being a delightful ball, which is seldom\nbestowed till after a ball has ceased to be, was repeatedly given in\nthe very beginning of the existence of this. Of very important, very\nrecordable events, it was not more productive than such meetings usually\nare. There was one, however, which Emma thought something of.--The two\nlast dances before supper were begun, and Harriet had no partner;--the\nonly young lady sitting down;--and so equal had been hitherto the\nnumber of dancers, that how there could be any one disengaged was the\nwonder!--But Emma's wonder lessened soon afterwards, on seeing Mr. Elton\nsauntering about. He would not ask Harriet to dance if it were possible\nto be avoided: she was sure he would not--and she was expecting him\nevery moment to escape into the card-room.\n\nEscape, however, was not his plan. He came to the part of the room where\nthe sitters-by were collected, spoke to some, and walked about in front\nof them, as if to shew his liberty, and his resolution of maintaining\nit. He did not omit being sometimes directly before Miss Smith, or\nspeaking to those who were close to her.--Emma saw it. She was not yet\ndancing; she was working her way up from the bottom, and had therefore\nleisure to look around, and by only turning her head a little she saw\nit all. When she was half-way up the set, the whole group were exactly\nbehind her, and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch; but Mr.\nElton was so near, that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which\njust then took place between him and Mrs. Weston; and she perceived that\nhis wife, who was standing immediately above her, was not only\nlistening also, but even encouraging him by significant glances.--The\nkind-hearted, gentle Mrs. Weston had left her seat to join him and say,\n“Do not you dance, Mr. Elton?” to which his prompt reply was, “Most\nreadily, Mrs. Weston, if you will dance with me.”\n\n“Me!--oh! no--I would get you a better partner than myself. I am no\ndancer.”\n\n“If Mrs. Gilbert wishes to dance,” said he, “I shall have great\npleasure, I am sure--for, though beginning to feel myself rather an old\nmarried man, and that my dancing days are over, it would give me very\ngreat pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like Mrs.\nGilbert.”\n\n“Mrs. Gilbert does not mean to dance, but there is a young lady\ndisengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing--Miss Smith.” “Miss\nSmith!--oh!--I had not observed.--You are extremely obliging--and if I\nwere not an old married man.--But my dancing days are over, Mrs. Weston.\nYou will excuse me. Any thing else I should be most happy to do, at your\ncommand--but my dancing days are over.”\n\nMrs. Weston said no more; and Emma could imagine with what surprize and\nmortification she must be returning to her seat. This was Mr. Elton! the\namiable, obliging, gentle Mr. Elton.--She looked round for a moment; he\nhad joined Mr. Knightley at a little distance, and was arranging himself\nfor settled conversation, while smiles of high glee passed between him\nand his wife.\n\nShe would not look again. Her heart was in a glow, and she feared her\nface might be as hot.\n\nIn another moment a happier sight caught her;--Mr. Knightley leading\nHarriet to the set!--Never had she been more surprized, seldom more\ndelighted, than at that instant. She was all pleasure and gratitude,\nboth for Harriet and herself, and longed to be thanking him; and though\ntoo distant for speech, her countenance said much, as soon as she could\ncatch his eye again.\n\nHis dancing proved to be just what she had believed it, extremely good;\nand Harriet would have seemed almost too lucky, if it had not been for\nthe cruel state of things before, and for the very complete enjoyment\nand very high sense of the distinction which her happy features\nannounced. It was not thrown away on her, she bounded higher than ever,\nflew farther down the middle, and was in a continual course of smiles.\n\nMr. Elton had retreated into the card-room, looking (Emma trusted) very\nfoolish. She did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife, though\ngrowing very like her;--_she_ spoke some of her feelings, by observing\naudibly to her partner,\n\n“Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith!--Very good-natured,\nI declare.”\n\nSupper was announced. The move began; and Miss Bates might be heard from\nthat moment, without interruption, till her being seated at table and\ntaking up her spoon.\n\n“Jane, Jane, my dear Jane, where are you?--Here is your tippet. Mrs.\nWeston begs you to put on your tippet. She says she is afraid there will\nbe draughts in the passage, though every thing has been done--One door\nnailed up--Quantities of matting--My dear Jane, indeed you must.\nMr. Churchill, oh! you are too obliging! How well you put it on!--so\ngratified! Excellent dancing indeed!--Yes, my dear, I ran home, as I\nsaid I should, to help grandmama to bed, and got back again, and\nnobody missed me.--I set off without saying a word, just as I told you.\nGrandmama was quite well, had a charming evening with Mr. Woodhouse, a\nvast deal of chat, and backgammon.--Tea was made downstairs, biscuits\nand baked apples and wine before she came away: amazing luck in some\nof her throws: and she inquired a great deal about you, how you were\namused, and who were your partners. 'Oh!' said I, 'I shall not forestall\nJane; I left her dancing with Mr. George Otway; she will love to tell\nyou all about it herself to-morrow: her first partner was Mr. Elton,\nI do not know who will ask her next, perhaps Mr. William Cox.' My dear\nsir, you are too obliging.--Is there nobody you would not rather?--I am\nnot helpless. Sir, you are most kind. Upon my word, Jane on one arm, and\nme on the other!--Stop, stop, let us stand a little back, Mrs. Elton is\ngoing; dear Mrs. Elton, how elegant she looks!--Beautiful lace!--Now we\nall follow in her train. Quite the queen of the evening!--Well, here we\nare at the passage. Two steps, Jane, take care of the two steps. Oh! no,\nthere is but one. Well, I was persuaded there were two. How very odd!\nI was convinced there were two, and there is but one. I never saw any\nthing equal to the comfort and style--Candles everywhere.--I was telling\nyou of your grandmama, Jane,--There was a little disappointment.--The\nbaked apples and biscuits, excellent in their way, you know; but there\nwas a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at\nfirst, and good Mr. Woodhouse, not thinking the asparagus quite boiled\nenough, sent it all out again. Now there is nothing grandmama loves\nbetter than sweetbread and asparagus--so she was rather disappointed,\nbut we agreed we would not speak of it to any body, for fear of\nits getting round to dear Miss Woodhouse, who would be so very much\nconcerned!--Well, this is brilliant! I am all amazement! could not have\nsupposed any thing!--Such elegance and profusion!--I have seen nothing\nlike it since--Well, where shall we sit? where shall we sit? Anywhere,\nso that Jane is not in a draught. Where _I_ sit is of no consequence.\nOh! do you recommend this side?--Well, I am sure, Mr. Churchill--only\nit seems too good--but just as you please. What you direct in this house\ncannot be wrong. Dear Jane, how shall we ever recollect half the dishes\nfor grandmama? Soup too! Bless me! I should not be helped so soon, but\nit smells most excellent, and I cannot help beginning.”\n\nEmma had no opportunity of speaking to Mr. Knightley till after supper;\nbut, when they were all in the ballroom again, her eyes invited\nhim irresistibly to come to her and be thanked. He was warm in his\nreprobation of Mr. Elton's conduct; it had been unpardonable rudeness;\nand Mrs. Elton's looks also received the due share of censure.\n\n“They aimed at wounding more than Harriet,” said he. “Emma, why is it\nthat they are your enemies?”\n\nHe looked with smiling penetration; and, on receiving no answer, added,\n“_She_ ought not to be angry with you, I suspect, whatever he may\nbe.--To that surmise, you say nothing, of course; but confess, Emma,\nthat you did want him to marry Harriet.”\n\n“I did,” replied Emma, “and they cannot forgive me.”\n\nHe shook his head; but there was a smile of indulgence with it, and he\nonly said,\n\n“I shall not scold you. I leave you to your own reflections.”\n\n“Can you trust me with such flatterers?--Does my vain spirit ever tell\nme I am wrong?”\n\n“Not your vain spirit, but your serious spirit.--If one leads you wrong,\nI am sure the other tells you of it.”\n\n“I do own myself to have been completely mistaken in Mr. Elton. There is\na littleness about him which you discovered, and which I did not: and I\nwas fully convinced of his being in love with Harriet. It was through a\nseries of strange blunders!”\n\n“And, in return for your acknowledging so much, I will do you the\njustice to say, that you would have chosen for him better than he has\nchosen for himself.--Harriet Smith has some first-rate qualities, which\nMrs. Elton is totally without. An unpretending, single-minded, artless\ngirl--infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a\nwoman as Mrs. Elton. I found Harriet more conversable than I expected.”\n\nEmma was extremely gratified.--They were interrupted by the bustle of\nMr. Weston calling on every body to begin dancing again.\n\n“Come Miss Woodhouse, Miss Otway, Miss Fairfax, what are you all\ndoing?--Come Emma, set your companions the example. Every body is lazy!\nEvery body is asleep!”\n\n“I am ready,” said Emma, “whenever I am wanted.”\n\n“Whom are you going to dance with?” asked Mr. Knightley.\n\nShe hesitated a moment, and then replied, “With you, if you will ask\nme.”\n\n“Will you?” said he, offering his hand.\n\n“Indeed I will. You have shewn that you can dance, and you know we are\nnot really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper.”\n\n“Brother and sister! no, indeed.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nThis little explanation with Mr. Knightley gave Emma considerable\npleasure. It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball, which\nshe walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy.--She was extremely\nglad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the\nEltons, and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much\nalike; and his praise of Harriet, his concession in her favour, was\npeculiarly gratifying. The impertinence of the Eltons, which for a few\nminutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening, had been the\noccasion of some of its highest satisfactions; and she looked forward\nto another happy result--the cure of Harriet's infatuation.--From\nHarriet's manner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted the\nballroom, she had strong hopes. It seemed as if her eyes were suddenly\nopened, and she were enabled to see that Mr. Elton was not the superior\ncreature she had believed him. The fever was over, and Emma could\nharbour little fear of the pulse being quickened again by injurious\ncourtesy. She depended on the evil feelings of the Eltons for\nsupplying all the discipline of pointed neglect that could be farther\nrequisite.--Harriet rational, Frank Churchill not too much in love, and\nMr. Knightley not wanting to quarrel with her, how very happy a summer\nmust be before her!\n\nShe was not to see Frank Churchill this morning. He had told her that he\ncould not allow himself the pleasure of stopping at Hartfield, as he was\nto be at home by the middle of the day. She did not regret it.\n\nHaving arranged all these matters, looked them through, and put them all\nto rights, she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened up\nfor the demands of the two little boys, as well as of their grandpapa,\nwhen the great iron sweep-gate opened, and two persons entered whom she\nhad never less expected to see together--Frank Churchill, with Harriet\nleaning on his arm--actually Harriet!--A moment sufficed to convince\nher that something extraordinary had happened. Harriet looked white\nand frightened, and he was trying to cheer her.--The iron gates and the\nfront-door were not twenty yards asunder;--they were all three soon in\nthe hall, and Harriet immediately sinking into a chair fainted away.\n\nA young lady who faints, must be recovered; questions must be answered,\nand surprizes be explained. Such events are very interesting, but the\nsuspense of them cannot last long. A few minutes made Emma acquainted\nwith the whole.\n\nMiss Smith, and Miss Bickerton, another parlour boarder at Mrs.\nGoddard's, who had been also at the ball, had walked out together, and\ntaken a road, the Richmond road, which, though apparently public enough\nfor safety, had led them into alarm.--About half a mile beyond Highbury,\nmaking a sudden turn, and deeply shaded by elms on each side, it became\nfor a considerable stretch very retired; and when the young ladies\nhad advanced some way into it, they had suddenly perceived at a small\ndistance before them, on a broader patch of greensward by the side, a\nparty of gipsies. A child on the watch, came towards them to beg; and\nMiss Bickerton, excessively frightened, gave a great scream, and calling\non Harriet to follow her, ran up a steep bank, cleared a slight hedge at\nthe top, and made the best of her way by a short cut back to Highbury.\nBut poor Harriet could not follow. She had suffered very much from cramp\nafter dancing, and her first attempt to mount the bank brought on such\na return of it as made her absolutely powerless--and in this state, and\nexceedingly terrified, she had been obliged to remain.\n\nHow the trampers might have behaved, had the young ladies been more\ncourageous, must be doubtful; but such an invitation for attack could\nnot be resisted; and Harriet was soon assailed by half a dozen children,\nheaded by a stout woman and a great boy, all clamorous, and impertinent\nin look, though not absolutely in word.--More and more frightened, she\nimmediately promised them money, and taking out her purse, gave them a\nshilling, and begged them not to want more, or to use her ill.--She\nwas then able to walk, though but slowly, and was moving away--but her\nterror and her purse were too tempting, and she was followed, or rather\nsurrounded, by the whole gang, demanding more.\n\nIn this state Frank Churchill had found her, she trembling and\nconditioning, they loud and insolent. By a most fortunate chance his\nleaving Highbury had been delayed so as to bring him to her assistance\nat this critical moment. The pleasantness of the morning had induced\nhim to walk forward, and leave his horses to meet him by another road,\na mile or two beyond Highbury--and happening to have borrowed a pair\nof scissors the night before of Miss Bates, and to have forgotten to\nrestore them, he had been obliged to stop at her door, and go in for a\nfew minutes: he was therefore later than he had intended; and being\non foot, was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them. The\nterror which the woman and boy had been creating in Harriet was then\ntheir own portion. He had left them completely frightened; and Harriet\neagerly clinging to him, and hardly able to speak, had just strength\nenough to reach Hartfield, before her spirits were quite overcome.\nIt was his idea to bring her to Hartfield: he had thought of no other\nplace.\n\nThis was the amount of the whole story,--of his communication and of\nHarriet's as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech.--He dared\nnot stay longer than to see her well; these several delays left him\nnot another minute to lose; and Emma engaging to give assurance of her\nsafety to Mrs. Goddard, and notice of there being such a set of people\nin the neighbourhood to Mr. Knightley, he set off, with all the grateful\nblessings that she could utter for her friend and herself.\n\nSuch an adventure as this,--a fine young man and a lovely young woman\nthrown together in such a way, could hardly fail of suggesting certain\nideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain. So Emma thought, at\nleast. Could a linguist, could a grammarian, could even a mathematician\nhave seen what she did, have witnessed their appearance together, and\nheard their history of it, without feeling that circumstances had been\nat work to make them peculiarly interesting to each other?--How much\nmore must an imaginist, like herself, be on fire with speculation and\nforesight!--especially with such a groundwork of anticipation as her\nmind had already made.\n\nIt was a very extraordinary thing! Nothing of the sort had ever\noccurred before to any young ladies in the place, within her memory; no\nrencontre, no alarm of the kind;--and now it had happened to the very\nperson, and at the very hour, when the other very person was chancing\nto pass by to rescue her!--It certainly was very extraordinary!--And\nknowing, as she did, the favourable state of mind of each at this\nperiod, it struck her the more. He was wishing to get the better of his\nattachment to herself, she just recovering from her mania for Mr. Elton.\nIt seemed as if every thing united to promise the most interesting\nconsequences. It was not possible that the occurrence should not be\nstrongly recommending each to the other.\n\nIn the few minutes' conversation which she had yet had with him, while\nHarriet had been partially insensible, he had spoken of her terror,\nher naivete, her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm, with a\nsensibility amused and delighted; and just at last, after Harriet's\nown account had been given, he had expressed his indignation at the\nabominable folly of Miss Bickerton in the warmest terms. Every thing was\nto take its natural course, however, neither impelled nor assisted.\nShe would not stir a step, nor drop a hint. No, she had had enough of\ninterference. There could be no harm in a scheme, a mere passive scheme.\nIt was no more than a wish. Beyond it she would on no account proceed.\n\nEmma's first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge of\nwhat had passed,--aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion: but\nshe soon felt that concealment must be impossible. Within half an hour\nit was known all over Highbury. It was the very event to engage those\nwho talk most, the young and the low; and all the youth and servants in\nthe place were soon in the happiness of frightful news. The last night's\nball seemed lost in the gipsies. Poor Mr. Woodhouse trembled as he sat,\nand, as Emma had foreseen, would scarcely be satisfied without their\npromising never to go beyond the shrubbery again. It was some comfort\nto him that many inquiries after himself and Miss Woodhouse (for his\nneighbours knew that he loved to be inquired after), as well as Miss\nSmith, were coming in during the rest of the day; and he had\nthe pleasure of returning for answer, that they were all very\nindifferent--which, though not exactly true, for she was perfectly well,\nand Harriet not much otherwise, Emma would not interfere with. She had\nan unhappy state of health in general for the child of such a man,\nfor she hardly knew what indisposition was; and if he did not invent\nillnesses for her, she could make no figure in a message.\n\nThe gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice; they took\nthemselves off in a hurry. The young ladies of Highbury might have\nwalked again in safety before their panic began, and the whole history\ndwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to Emma and her\nnephews:--in her imagination it maintained its ground, and Henry and\nJohn were still asking every day for the story of Harriet and the\ngipsies, and still tenaciously setting her right if she varied in the\nslightest particular from the original recital.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nA very few days had passed after this adventure, when Harriet came one\nmorning to Emma with a small parcel in her hand, and after sitting down\nand hesitating, thus began:\n\n“Miss Woodhouse--if you are at leisure--I have something that I should\nlike to tell you--a sort of confession to make--and then, you know, it\nwill be over.”\n\nEmma was a good deal surprized; but begged her to speak. There was a\nseriousness in Harriet's manner which prepared her, quite as much as her\nwords, for something more than ordinary.\n\n“It is my duty, and I am sure it is my wish,” she continued, “to have\nno reserves with you on this subject. As I am happily quite an altered\ncreature in _one_ _respect_, it is very fit that you should have\nthe satisfaction of knowing it. I do not want to say more than is\nnecessary--I am too much ashamed of having given way as I have done, and\nI dare say you understand me.”\n\n“Yes,” said Emma, “I hope I do.”\n\n“How I could so long a time be fancying myself!...” cried Harriet,\nwarmly. “It seems like madness! I can see nothing at all extraordinary\nin him now.--I do not care whether I meet him or not--except that of the\ntwo I had rather not see him--and indeed I would go any distance round\nto avoid him--but I do not envy his wife in the least; I neither admire\nher nor envy her, as I have done: she is very charming, I dare say, and\nall that, but I think her very ill-tempered and disagreeable--I shall\nnever forget her look the other night!--However, I assure you, Miss\nWoodhouse, I wish her no evil.--No, let them be ever so happy together,\nit will not give me another moment's pang: and to convince you that I\nhave been speaking truth, I am now going to destroy--what I ought to\nhave destroyed long ago--what I ought never to have kept--I know that\nvery well (blushing as she spoke).--However, now I will destroy it\nall--and it is my particular wish to do it in your presence, that you\nmay see how rational I am grown. Cannot you guess what this parcel\nholds?” said she, with a conscious look.\n\n“Not the least in the world.--Did he ever give you any thing?”\n\n“No--I cannot call them gifts; but they are things that I have valued\nvery much.”\n\nShe held the parcel towards her, and Emma read the words _Most_\n_precious_ _treasures_ on the top. Her curiosity was greatly excited.\nHarriet unfolded the parcel, and she looked on with impatience. Within\nabundance of silver paper was a pretty little Tunbridge-ware box,\nwhich Harriet opened: it was well lined with the softest cotton; but,\nexcepting the cotton, Emma saw only a small piece of court-plaister.\n\n“Now,” said Harriet, “you _must_ recollect.”\n\n“No, indeed I do not.”\n\n“Dear me! I should not have thought it possible you could forget what\npassed in this very room about court-plaister, one of the very last\ntimes we ever met in it!--It was but a very few days before I had my\nsore throat--just before Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley came--I think the\nvery evening.--Do not you remember his cutting his finger with your new\npenknife, and your recommending court-plaister?--But, as you had none\nabout you, and knew I had, you desired me to supply him; and so I took\nmine out and cut him a piece; but it was a great deal too large, and he\ncut it smaller, and kept playing some time with what was left, before he\ngave it back to me. And so then, in my nonsense, I could not help making\na treasure of it--so I put it by never to be used, and looked at it now\nand then as a great treat.”\n\n“My dearest Harriet!” cried Emma, putting her hand before her face,\nand jumping up, “you make me more ashamed of myself than I can bear.\nRemember it? Aye, I remember it all now; all, except your saving this\nrelic--I knew nothing of that till this moment--but the cutting the\nfinger, and my recommending court-plaister, and saying I had none\nabout me!--Oh! my sins, my sins!--And I had plenty all the while in my\npocket!--One of my senseless tricks!--I deserve to be under a continual\nblush all the rest of my life.--Well--(sitting down again)--go on--what\nelse?”\n\n“And had you really some at hand yourself? I am sure I never suspected\nit, you did it so naturally.”\n\n“And so you actually put this piece of court-plaister by for his sake!”\n said Emma, recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided\nbetween wonder and amusement. And secretly she added to herself, “Lord\nbless me! when should I ever have thought of putting by in cotton a\npiece of court-plaister that Frank Churchill had been pulling about! I\nnever was equal to this.”\n\n“Here,” resumed Harriet, turning to her box again, “here is something\nstill more valuable, I mean that _has_ _been_ more valuable, because\nthis is what did really once belong to him, which the court-plaister\nnever did.”\n\nEmma was quite eager to see this superior treasure. It was the end of an\nold pencil,--the part without any lead.\n\n“This was really his,” said Harriet.--“Do not you remember one\nmorning?--no, I dare say you do not. But one morning--I forget exactly\nthe day--but perhaps it was the Tuesday or Wednesday before _that_\n_evening_, he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket-book; it was\nabout spruce-beer. Mr. Knightley had been telling him something about\nbrewing spruce-beer, and he wanted to put it down; but when he took out\nhis pencil, there was so little lead that he soon cut it all away, and\nit would not do, so you lent him another, and this was left upon the\ntable as good for nothing. But I kept my eye on it; and, as soon as I\ndared, caught it up, and never parted with it again from that moment.”\n\n“I do remember it,” cried Emma; “I perfectly remember it.--Talking\nabout spruce-beer.--Oh! yes--Mr. Knightley and I both saying we\nliked it, and Mr. Elton's seeming resolved to learn to like it too. I\nperfectly remember it.--Stop; Mr. Knightley was standing just here, was\nnot he? I have an idea he was standing just here.”\n\n“Ah! I do not know. I cannot recollect.--It is very odd, but I cannot\nrecollect.--Mr. Elton was sitting here, I remember, much about where I\nam now.”--\n\n“Well, go on.”\n\n“Oh! that's all. I have nothing more to shew you, or to say--except that\nI am now going to throw them both behind the fire, and I wish you to see\nme do it.”\n\n“My poor dear Harriet! and have you actually found happiness in\ntreasuring up these things?”\n\n“Yes, simpleton as I was!--but I am quite ashamed of it now, and wish I\ncould forget as easily as I can burn them. It was very wrong of me, you\nknow, to keep any remembrances, after he was married. I knew it was--but\nhad not resolution enough to part with them.”\n\n“But, Harriet, is it necessary to burn the court-plaister?--I have not\na word to say for the bit of old pencil, but the court-plaister might be\nuseful.”\n\n“I shall be happier to burn it,” replied Harriet. “It has a disagreeable\nlook to me. I must get rid of every thing.--There it goes, and there is\nan end, thank Heaven! of Mr. Elton.”\n\n“And when,” thought Emma, “will there be a beginning of Mr. Churchill?”\n\nShe had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was already\nmade, and could not but hope that the gipsy, though she had _told_ no\nfortune, might be proved to have made Harriet's.--About a fortnight\nafter the alarm, they came to a sufficient explanation, and quite\nundesignedly. Emma was not thinking of it at the moment, which made the\ninformation she received more valuable. She merely said, in the course\nof some trivial chat, “Well, Harriet, whenever you marry I would advise\nyou to do so and so”--and thought no more of it, till after a minute's\nsilence she heard Harriet say in a very serious tone, “I shall never\nmarry.”\n\nEmma then looked up, and immediately saw how it was; and after a\nmoment's debate, as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not, replied,\n\n“Never marry!--This is a new resolution.”\n\n“It is one that I shall never change, however.”\n\nAfter another short hesitation, “I hope it does not proceed from--I hope\nit is not in compliment to Mr. Elton?”\n\n“Mr. Elton indeed!” cried Harriet indignantly.--“Oh! no”--and Emma could\njust catch the words, “so superior to Mr. Elton!”\n\nShe then took a longer time for consideration. Should she proceed no\nfarther?--should she let it pass, and seem to suspect nothing?--Perhaps\nHarriet might think her cold or angry if she did; or perhaps if she were\ntotally silent, it might only drive Harriet into asking her to hear too\nmuch; and against any thing like such an unreserve as had been, such\nan open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances, she was perfectly\nresolved.--She believed it would be wiser for her to say and know at\nonce, all that she meant to say and know. Plain dealing was always\nbest. She had previously determined how far she would proceed, on any\napplication of the sort; and it would be safer for both, to have the\njudicious law of her own brain laid down with speed.--She was decided,\nand thus spoke--\n\n“Harriet, I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning. Your\nresolution, or rather your expectation of never marrying, results from\nan idea that the person whom you might prefer, would be too greatly your\nsuperior in situation to think of you. Is not it so?”\n\n“Oh! Miss Woodhouse, believe me I have not the presumption to suppose--\nIndeed I am not so mad.--But it is a pleasure to me to admire him at a\ndistance--and to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of\nthe world, with the gratitude, wonder, and veneration, which are so\nproper, in me especially.”\n\n“I am not at all surprized at you, Harriet. The service he rendered you\nwas enough to warm your heart.”\n\n“Service! oh! it was such an inexpressible obligation!--The very\nrecollection of it, and all that I felt at the time--when I saw him\ncoming--his noble look--and my wretchedness before. Such a change! In\none moment such a change! From perfect misery to perfect happiness!”\n\n“It is very natural. It is natural, and it is honourable.--Yes,\nhonourable, I think, to chuse so well and so gratefully.--But that\nit will be a fortunate preference is more than I can promise. I do not\nadvise you to give way to it, Harriet. I do not by any means engage\nfor its being returned. Consider what you are about. Perhaps it will be\nwisest in you to check your feelings while you can: at any rate do not\nlet them carry you far, unless you are persuaded of his liking you. Be\nobservant of him. Let his behaviour be the guide of your sensations. I\ngive you this caution now, because I shall never speak to you again on\nthe subject. I am determined against all interference. Henceforward I\nknow nothing of the matter. Let no name ever pass our lips. We were very\nwrong before; we will be cautious now.--He is your superior, no doubt,\nand there do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature; but\nyet, Harriet, more wonderful things have taken place, there have been\nmatches of greater disparity. But take care of yourself. I would not\nhave you too sanguine; though, however it may end, be assured your\nraising your thoughts to _him_, is a mark of good taste which I shall\nalways know how to value.”\n\nHarriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude. Emma was\nvery decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing for her friend.\nIts tendency would be to raise and refine her mind--and it must be\nsaving her from the danger of degradation.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nIn this state of schemes, and hopes, and connivance, June opened upon\nHartfield. To Highbury in general it brought no material change. The\nEltons were still talking of a visit from the Sucklings, and of the use\nto be made of their barouche-landau; and Jane Fairfax was still at her\ngrandmother's; and as the return of the Campbells from Ireland was again\ndelayed, and August, instead of Midsummer, fixed for it, she was likely\nto remain there full two months longer, provided at least she were able\nto defeat Mrs. Elton's activity in her service, and save herself from\nbeing hurried into a delightful situation against her will.\n\nMr. Knightley, who, for some reason best known to himself, had certainly\ntaken an early dislike to Frank Churchill, was only growing to dislike\nhim more. He began to suspect him of some double dealing in his pursuit\nof Emma. That Emma was his object appeared indisputable. Every thing\ndeclared it; his own attentions, his father's hints, his mother-in-law's\nguarded silence; it was all in unison; words, conduct, discretion, and\nindiscretion, told the same story. But while so many were devoting him\nto Emma, and Emma herself making him over to Harriet, Mr. Knightley\nbegan to suspect him of some inclination to trifle with Jane Fairfax. He\ncould not understand it; but there were symptoms of intelligence between\nthem--he thought so at least--symptoms of admiration on his side, which,\nhaving once observed, he could not persuade himself to think entirely\nvoid of meaning, however he might wish to escape any of Emma's errors\nof imagination. _She_ was not present when the suspicion first arose.\nHe was dining with the Randalls family, and Jane, at the Eltons'; and he\nhad seen a look, more than a single look, at Miss Fairfax, which, from\nthe admirer of Miss Woodhouse, seemed somewhat out of place. When he was\nagain in their company, he could not help remembering what he had seen;\nnor could he avoid observations which, unless it were like Cowper and\nhis fire at twilight,\n\n“Myself creating what I saw,”\n\nbrought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of private\nliking, of private understanding even, between Frank Churchill and Jane.\n\nHe had walked up one day after dinner, as he very often did, to spend\nhis evening at Hartfield. Emma and Harriet were going to walk; he joined\nthem; and, on returning, they fell in with a larger party, who, like\nthemselves, judged it wisest to take their exercise early, as the\nweather threatened rain; Mr. and Mrs. Weston and their son, Miss Bates\nand her niece, who had accidentally met. They all united; and, on\nreaching Hartfield gates, Emma, who knew it was exactly the sort of\nvisiting that would be welcome to her father, pressed them all to go in\nand drink tea with him. The Randalls party agreed to it immediately; and\nafter a pretty long speech from Miss Bates, which few persons listened\nto, she also found it possible to accept dear Miss Woodhouse's most\nobliging invitation.\n\nAs they were turning into the grounds, Mr. Perry passed by on horseback.\nThe gentlemen spoke of his horse.\n\n“By the bye,” said Frank Churchill to Mrs. Weston presently, “what\nbecame of Mr. Perry's plan of setting up his carriage?”\n\nMrs. Weston looked surprized, and said, “I did not know that he ever had\nany such plan.”\n\n“Nay, I had it from you. You wrote me word of it three months ago.”\n\n“Me! impossible!”\n\n“Indeed you did. I remember it perfectly. You mentioned it as what\nwas certainly to be very soon. Mrs. Perry had told somebody, and was\nextremely happy about it. It was owing to _her_ persuasion, as she\nthought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm. You\nmust remember it now?”\n\n“Upon my word I never heard of it till this moment.”\n\n“Never! really, never!--Bless me! how could it be?--Then I must have\ndreamt it--but I was completely persuaded--Miss Smith, you walk as if\nyou were tired. You will not be sorry to find yourself at home.”\n\n“What is this?--What is this?” cried Mr. Weston, “about Perry and a\ncarriage? Is Perry going to set up his carriage, Frank? I am glad he can\nafford it. You had it from himself, had you?”\n\n“No, sir,” replied his son, laughing, “I seem to have had it from\nnobody.--Very odd!--I really was persuaded of Mrs. Weston's having\nmentioned it in one of her letters to Enscombe, many weeks ago, with all\nthese particulars--but as she declares she never heard a syllable of\nit before, of course it must have been a dream. I am a great dreamer.\nI dream of every body at Highbury when I am away--and when I have gone\nthrough my particular friends, then I begin dreaming of Mr. and Mrs.\nPerry.”\n\n“It is odd though,” observed his father, “that you should have had such\na regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you\nshould be thinking of at Enscombe. Perry's setting up his carriage! and\nhis wife's persuading him to it, out of care for his health--just\nwhat will happen, I have no doubt, some time or other; only a little\npremature. What an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream!\nAnd at others, what a heap of absurdities it is! Well, Frank, your dream\ncertainly shews that Highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent.\nEmma, you are a great dreamer, I think?”\n\nEmma was out of hearing. She had hurried on before her guests to\nprepare her father for their appearance, and was beyond the reach of Mr.\nWeston's hint.\n\n“Why, to own the truth,” cried Miss Bates, who had been trying in vain\nto be heard the last two minutes, “if I must speak on this subject,\nthere is no denying that Mr. Frank Churchill might have--I do not mean\nto say that he did not dream it--I am sure I have sometimes the oddest\ndreams in the world--but if I am questioned about it, I must acknowledge\nthat there was such an idea last spring; for Mrs. Perry herself\nmentioned it to my mother, and the Coles knew of it as well as\nourselves--but it was quite a secret, known to nobody else, and only\nthought of about three days. Mrs. Perry was very anxious that he should\nhave a carriage, and came to my mother in great spirits one morning\nbecause she thought she had prevailed. Jane, don't you remember\ngrandmama's telling us of it when we got home? I forget where we\nhad been walking to--very likely to Randalls; yes, I think it was to\nRandalls. Mrs. Perry was always particularly fond of my mother--indeed\nI do not know who is not--and she had mentioned it to her in confidence;\nshe had no objection to her telling us, of course, but it was not to go\nbeyond: and, from that day to this, I never mentioned it to a soul that\nI know of. At the same time, I will not positively answer for my having\nnever dropt a hint, because I know I do sometimes pop out a thing before\nI am aware. I am a talker, you know; I am rather a talker; and now and\nthen I have let a thing escape me which I should not. I am not like\nJane; I wish I were. I will answer for it _she_ never betrayed the least\nthing in the world. Where is she?--Oh! just behind. Perfectly remember\nMrs. Perry's coming.--Extraordinary dream, indeed!”\n\nThey were entering the hall. Mr. Knightley's eyes had preceded Miss\nBates's in a glance at Jane. From Frank Churchill's face, where\nhe thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away, he had\ninvoluntarily turned to hers; but she was indeed behind, and too busy\nwith her shawl. Mr. Weston had walked in. The two other gentlemen waited\nat the door to let her pass. Mr. Knightley suspected in Frank\nChurchill the determination of catching her eye--he seemed watching her\nintently--in vain, however, if it were so--Jane passed between them\ninto the hall, and looked at neither.\n\nThere was no time for farther remark or explanation. The dream must be\nborne with, and Mr. Knightley must take his seat with the rest round the\nlarge modern circular table which Emma had introduced at Hartfield, and\nwhich none but Emma could have had power to place there and persuade her\nfather to use, instead of the small-sized Pembroke, on which two of his\ndaily meals had, for forty years been crowded. Tea passed pleasantly,\nand nobody seemed in a hurry to move.\n\n“Miss Woodhouse,” said Frank Churchill, after examining a table behind\nhim, which he could reach as he sat, “have your nephews taken away their\nalphabets--their box of letters? It used to stand here. Where is it?\nThis is a sort of dull-looking evening, that ought to be treated rather\nas winter than summer. We had great amusement with those letters one\nmorning. I want to puzzle you again.”\n\nEmma was pleased with the thought; and producing the box, the table\nwas quickly scattered over with alphabets, which no one seemed so much\ndisposed to employ as their two selves. They were rapidly forming words\nfor each other, or for any body else who would be puzzled. The quietness\nof the game made it particularly eligible for Mr. Woodhouse, who had\noften been distressed by the more animated sort, which Mr. Weston had\noccasionally introduced, and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting,\nwith tender melancholy, over the departure of the “poor little boys,”\n or in fondly pointing out, as he took up any stray letter near him, how\nbeautifully Emma had written it.\n\nFrank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax. She gave a slight\nglance round the table, and applied herself to it. Frank was next to\nEmma, Jane opposite to them--and Mr. Knightley so placed as to see them\nall; and it was his object to see as much as he could, with as little\napparent observation. The word was discovered, and with a faint smile\npushed away. If meant to be immediately mixed with the others, and\nburied from sight, she should have looked on the table instead of\nlooking just across, for it was not mixed; and Harriet, eager after\nevery fresh word, and finding out none, directly took it up, and fell to\nwork. She was sitting by Mr. Knightley, and turned to him for help. The\nword was _blunder_; and as Harriet exultingly proclaimed it, there was a\nblush on Jane's cheek which gave it a meaning not otherwise ostensible.\nMr. Knightley connected it with the dream; but how it could all be,\nwas beyond his comprehension. How the delicacy, the discretion of his\nfavourite could have been so lain asleep! He feared there must be some\ndecided involvement. Disingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet\nhim at every turn. These letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and\ntrick. It was a child's play, chosen to conceal a deeper game on Frank\nChurchill's part.\n\nWith great indignation did he continue to observe him; with great alarm\nand distrust, to observe also his two blinded companions. He saw a short\nword prepared for Emma, and given to her with a look sly and demure. He\nsaw that Emma had soon made it out, and found it highly entertaining,\nthough it was something which she judged it proper to appear to censure;\nfor she said, “Nonsense! for shame!” He heard Frank Churchill next say,\nwith a glance towards Jane, “I will give it to her--shall I?”--and as\nclearly heard Emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth. “No, no, you\nmust not; you shall not, indeed.”\n\nIt was done however. This gallant young man, who seemed to love without\nfeeling, and to recommend himself without complaisance, directly handed\nover the word to Miss Fairfax, and with a particular degree of sedate\ncivility entreated her to study it. Mr. Knightley's excessive curiosity\nto know what this word might be, made him seize every possible moment\nfor darting his eye towards it, and it was not long before he saw it\nto be _Dixon_. Jane Fairfax's perception seemed to accompany his;\nher comprehension was certainly more equal to the covert meaning,\nthe superior intelligence, of those five letters so arranged. She was\nevidently displeased; looked up, and seeing herself watched, blushed\nmore deeply than he had ever perceived her, and saying only, “I did not\nknow that proper names were allowed,” pushed away the letters with even\nan angry spirit, and looked resolved to be engaged by no other word\nthat could be offered. Her face was averted from those who had made the\nattack, and turned towards her aunt.\n\n“Aye, very true, my dear,” cried the latter, though Jane had not spoken\na word--“I was just going to say the same thing. It is time for us to be\ngoing indeed. The evening is closing in, and grandmama will be looking\nfor us. My dear sir, you are too obliging. We really must wish you good\nnight.”\n\nJane's alertness in moving, proved her as ready as her aunt had\npreconceived. She was immediately up, and wanting to quit the table; but\nso many were also moving, that she could not get away; and Mr. Knightley\nthought he saw another collection of letters anxiously pushed towards\nher, and resolutely swept away by her unexamined. She was afterwards\nlooking for her shawl--Frank Churchill was looking also--it was growing\ndusk, and the room was in confusion; and how they parted, Mr. Knightley\ncould not tell.\n\nHe remained at Hartfield after all the rest, his thoughts full of\nwhat he had seen; so full, that when the candles came to assist his\nobservations, he must--yes, he certainly must, as a friend--an anxious\nfriend--give Emma some hint, ask her some question. He could not see her\nin a situation of such danger, without trying to preserve her. It was\nhis duty.\n\n“Pray, Emma,” said he, “may I ask in what lay the great amusement, the\npoignant sting of the last word given to you and Miss Fairfax? I saw the\nword, and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the\none, and so very distressing to the other.”\n\nEmma was extremely confused. She could not endure to give him the true\nexplanation; for though her suspicions were by no means removed, she was\nreally ashamed of having ever imparted them.\n\n“Oh!” she cried in evident embarrassment, “it all meant nothing; a mere\njoke among ourselves.”\n\n“The joke,” he replied gravely, “seemed confined to you and Mr.\nChurchill.”\n\nHe had hoped she would speak again, but she did not. She would rather\nbusy herself about any thing than speak. He sat a little while in\ndoubt. A variety of evils crossed his mind. Interference--fruitless\ninterference. Emma's confusion, and the acknowledged intimacy, seemed to\ndeclare her affection engaged. Yet he would speak. He owed it to her,\nto risk any thing that might be involved in an unwelcome interference,\nrather than her welfare; to encounter any thing, rather than the\nremembrance of neglect in such a cause.\n\n“My dear Emma,” said he at last, with earnest kindness, “do you\nthink you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the\ngentleman and lady we have been speaking of?”\n\n“Between Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax? Oh! yes, perfectly.--Why\ndo you make a doubt of it?”\n\n“Have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her, or\nthat she admired him?”\n\n“Never, never!” she cried with a most open eagerness--“Never, for the\ntwentieth part of a moment, did such an idea occur to me. And how could\nit possibly come into your head?”\n\n“I have lately imagined that I saw symptoms of attachment between\nthem--certain expressive looks, which I did not believe meant to be\npublic.”\n\n“Oh! you amuse me excessively. I am delighted to find that you can\nvouchsafe to let your imagination wander--but it will not do--very sorry\nto check you in your first essay--but indeed it will not do. There is no\nadmiration between them, I do assure you; and the appearances which\nhave caught you, have arisen from some peculiar circumstances--feelings\nrather of a totally different nature--it is impossible exactly to\nexplain:--there is a good deal of nonsense in it--but the part which is\ncapable of being communicated, which is sense, is, that they are as far\nfrom any attachment or admiration for one another, as any two beings in\nthe world can be. That is, I _presume_ it to be so on her side, and I\ncan _answer_ for its being so on his. I will answer for the gentleman's\nindifference.”\n\nShe spoke with a confidence which staggered, with a satisfaction\nwhich silenced, Mr. Knightley. She was in gay spirits, and would have\nprolonged the conversation, wanting to hear the particulars of his\nsuspicions, every look described, and all the wheres and hows of a\ncircumstance which highly entertained her: but his gaiety did not meet\nhers. He found he could not be useful, and his feelings were too much\nirritated for talking. That he might not be irritated into an absolute\nfever, by the fire which Mr. Woodhouse's tender habits required almost\nevery evening throughout the year, he soon afterwards took a hasty\nleave, and walked home to the coolness and solitude of Donwell Abbey.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nAfter being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from Mr. and Mrs.\nSuckling, the Highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification\nof hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn. No such\nimportation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores at\npresent. In the daily interchange of news, they must be again restricted\nto the other topics with which for a while the Sucklings' coming had\nbeen united, such as the last accounts of Mrs. Churchill, whose health\nseemed every day to supply a different report, and the situation of Mrs.\nWeston, whose happiness it was to be hoped might eventually be as much\nincreased by the arrival of a child, as that of all her neighbours was\nby the approach of it.\n\nMrs. Elton was very much disappointed. It was the delay of a great deal\nof pleasure and parade. Her introductions and recommendations must all\nwait, and every projected party be still only talked of. So she thought\nat first;--but a little consideration convinced her that every thing\nneed not be put off. Why should not they explore to Box Hill though\nthe Sucklings did not come? They could go there again with them in the\nautumn. It was settled that they should go to Box Hill. That there was\nto be such a party had been long generally known: it had even given the\nidea of another. Emma had never been to Box Hill; she wished to see what\nevery body found so well worth seeing, and she and Mr. Weston had agreed\nto chuse some fine morning and drive thither. Two or three more of the\nchosen only were to be admitted to join them, and it was to be done in a\nquiet, unpretending, elegant way, infinitely superior to the bustle and\npreparation, the regular eating and drinking, and picnic parade of the\nEltons and the Sucklings.\n\nThis was so very well understood between them, that Emma could not but\nfeel some surprise, and a little displeasure, on hearing from Mr. Weston\nthat he had been proposing to Mrs. Elton, as her brother and sister had\nfailed her, that the two parties should unite, and go together; and that\nas Mrs. Elton had very readily acceded to it, so it was to be, if she\nhad no objection. Now, as her objection was nothing but her very great\ndislike of Mrs. Elton, of which Mr. Weston must already be perfectly\naware, it was not worth bringing forward again:--it could not be done\nwithout a reproof to him, which would be giving pain to his wife; and\nshe found herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which\nshe would have done a great deal to avoid; an arrangement which would\nprobably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of Mrs.\nElton's party! Every feeling was offended; and the forbearance of her\noutward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity in her\nreflections on the unmanageable goodwill of Mr. Weston's temper.\n\n“I am glad you approve of what I have done,” said he very comfortably.\n“But I thought you would. Such schemes as these are nothing without\nnumbers. One cannot have too large a party. A large party secures its\nown amusement. And she is a good-natured woman after all. One could not\nleave her out.”\n\nEmma denied none of it aloud, and agreed to none of it in private.\n\nIt was now the middle of June, and the weather fine; and Mrs. Elton\nwas growing impatient to name the day, and settle with Mr. Weston as to\npigeon-pies and cold lamb, when a lame carriage-horse threw every thing\ninto sad uncertainty. It might be weeks, it might be only a few days,\nbefore the horse were useable; but no preparations could be ventured\non, and it was all melancholy stagnation. Mrs. Elton's resources were\ninadequate to such an attack.\n\n“Is not this most vexatious, Knightley?” she cried.--“And such weather\nfor exploring!--These delays and disappointments are quite odious. What\nare we to do?--The year will wear away at this rate, and nothing\ndone. Before this time last year I assure you we had had a delightful\nexploring party from Maple Grove to Kings Weston.”\n\n“You had better explore to Donwell,” replied Mr. Knightley. “That may\nbe done without horses. Come, and eat my strawberries. They are ripening\nfast.”\n\nIf Mr. Knightley did not begin seriously, he was obliged to proceed so,\nfor his proposal was caught at with delight; and the “Oh! I should like\nit of all things,” was not plainer in words than manner. Donwell was\nfamous for its strawberry-beds, which seemed a plea for the invitation:\nbut no plea was necessary; cabbage-beds would have been enough to tempt\nthe lady, who only wanted to be going somewhere. She promised him again\nand again to come--much oftener than he doubted--and was extremely\ngratified by such a proof of intimacy, such a distinguishing compliment\nas she chose to consider it.\n\n“You may depend upon me,” said she. “I certainly will come. Name your\nday, and I will come. You will allow me to bring Jane Fairfax?”\n\n“I cannot name a day,” said he, “till I have spoken to some others whom\nI would wish to meet you.”\n\n“Oh! leave all that to me. Only give me a carte-blanche.--I am Lady\nPatroness, you know. It is my party. I will bring friends with me.”\n\n“I hope you will bring Elton,” said he: “but I will not trouble you to\ngive any other invitations.”\n\n“Oh! now you are looking very sly. But consider--you need not be afraid\nof delegating power to _me_. I am no young lady on her preferment.\nMarried women, you know, may be safely authorised. It is my party. Leave\nit all to me. I will invite your guests.”\n\n“No,”--he calmly replied,--“there is but one married woman in the world\nwhom I can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to Donwell, and\nthat one is--”\n\n“--Mrs. Weston, I suppose,” interrupted Mrs. Elton, rather mortified.\n\n“No--Mrs. Knightley;--and till she is in being, I will manage such\nmatters myself.”\n\n“Ah! you are an odd creature!” she cried, satisfied to have no one\npreferred to herself.--“You are a humourist, and may say what you\nlike. Quite a humourist. Well, I shall bring Jane with me--Jane and her\naunt.--The rest I leave to you. I have no objections at all to meeting\nthe Hartfield family. Don't scruple. I know you are attached to them.”\n\n“You certainly will meet them if I can prevail; and I shall call on Miss\nBates in my way home.”\n\n“That's quite unnecessary; I see Jane every day:--but as you like. It\nis to be a morning scheme, you know, Knightley; quite a simple thing. I\nshall wear a large bonnet, and bring one of my little baskets hanging\non my arm. Here,--probably this basket with pink ribbon. Nothing can be\nmore simple, you see. And Jane will have such another. There is to be\nno form or parade--a sort of gipsy party. We are to walk about\nyour gardens, and gather the strawberries ourselves, and sit under\ntrees;--and whatever else you may like to provide, it is to be all out\nof doors--a table spread in the shade, you know. Every thing as natural\nand simple as possible. Is not that your idea?”\n\n“Not quite. My idea of the simple and the natural will be to have\nthe table spread in the dining-room. The nature and the simplicity of\ngentlemen and ladies, with their servants and furniture, I think is\nbest observed by meals within doors. When you are tired of eating\nstrawberries in the garden, there shall be cold meat in the house.”\n\n“Well--as you please; only don't have a great set out. And, by the bye,\ncan I or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion?--Pray be\nsincere, Knightley. If you wish me to talk to Mrs. Hodges, or to inspect\nanything--”\n\n“I have not the least wish for it, I thank you.”\n\n“Well--but if any difficulties should arise, my housekeeper is extremely\nclever.”\n\n“I will answer for it, that mine thinks herself full as clever, and\nwould spurn any body's assistance.”\n\n“I wish we had a donkey. The thing would be for us all to come on\ndonkeys, Jane, Miss Bates, and me--and my caro sposo walking by. I\nreally must talk to him about purchasing a donkey. In a country life\nI conceive it to be a sort of necessary; for, let a woman have ever\nso many resources, it is not possible for her to be always shut up at\nhome;--and very long walks, you know--in summer there is dust, and in\nwinter there is dirt.”\n\n“You will not find either, between Donwell and Highbury. Donwell Lane is\nnever dusty, and now it is perfectly dry. Come on a donkey, however, if\nyou prefer it. You can borrow Mrs. Cole's. I would wish every thing to\nbe as much to your taste as possible.”\n\n“That I am sure you would. Indeed I do you justice, my good friend.\nUnder that peculiar sort of dry, blunt manner, I know you have the\nwarmest heart. As I tell Mr. E., you are a thorough humourist.--Yes,\nbelieve me, Knightley, I am fully sensible of your attention to me in\nthe whole of this scheme. You have hit upon the very thing to please\nme.”\n\nMr. Knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade. He\nwished to persuade Mr. Woodhouse, as well as Emma, to join the party;\nand he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors to\neat would inevitably make him ill. Mr. Woodhouse must not, under the\nspecious pretence of a morning drive, and an hour or two spent at\nDonwell, be tempted away to his misery.\n\nHe was invited on good faith. No lurking horrors were to upbraid him for\nhis easy credulity. He did consent. He had not been at Donwell for two\nyears. “Some very fine morning, he, and Emma, and Harriet, could go\nvery well; and he could sit still with Mrs. Weston, while the dear girls\nwalked about the gardens. He did not suppose they could be damp now,\nin the middle of the day. He should like to see the old house again\nexceedingly, and should be very happy to meet Mr. and Mrs. Elton, and\nany other of his neighbours.--He could not see any objection at all to\nhis, and Emma's, and Harriet's going there some very fine morning. He\nthought it very well done of Mr. Knightley to invite them--very kind\nand sensible--much cleverer than dining out.--He was not fond of dining\nout.”\n\nMr. Knightley was fortunate in every body's most ready concurrence. The\ninvitation was everywhere so well received, that it seemed as if, like\nMrs. Elton, they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment\nto themselves.--Emma and Harriet professed very high expectations of\npleasure from it; and Mr. Weston, unasked, promised to get Frank over to\njoin them, if possible; a proof of approbation and gratitude which could\nhave been dispensed with.--Mr. Knightley was then obliged to say that\nhe should be glad to see him; and Mr. Weston engaged to lose no time in\nwriting, and spare no arguments to induce him to come.\n\nIn the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast, that the party to\nBox Hill was again under happy consideration; and at last Donwell was\nsettled for one day, and Box Hill for the next,--the weather appearing\nexactly right.\n\nUnder a bright mid-day sun, at almost Midsummer, Mr. Woodhouse was\nsafely conveyed in his carriage, with one window down, to partake of\nthis al-fresco party; and in one of the most comfortable rooms in the\nAbbey, especially prepared for him by a fire all the morning, he was\nhappily placed, quite at his ease, ready to talk with pleasure of what\nhad been achieved, and advise every body to come and sit down, and not\nto heat themselves.--Mrs. Weston, who seemed to have walked there on\npurpose to be tired, and sit all the time with him, remained, when\nall the others were invited or persuaded out, his patient listener and\nsympathiser.\n\nIt was so long since Emma had been at the Abbey, that as soon as she was\nsatisfied of her father's comfort, she was glad to leave him, and look\naround her; eager to refresh and correct her memory with more particular\nobservation, more exact understanding of a house and grounds which must\never be so interesting to her and all her family.\n\nShe felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance with\nthe present and future proprietor could fairly warrant, as she viewed\nthe respectable size and style of the building, its suitable, becoming,\ncharacteristic situation, low and sheltered--its ample gardens\nstretching down to meadows washed by a stream, of which the Abbey, with\nall the old neglect of prospect, had scarcely a sight--and its abundance\nof timber in rows and avenues, which neither fashion nor extravagance\nhad rooted up.--The house was larger than Hartfield, and totally unlike\nit, covering a good deal of ground, rambling and irregular, with many\ncomfortable, and one or two handsome rooms.--It was just what it ought\nto be, and it looked what it was--and Emma felt an increasing respect\nfor it, as the residence of a family of such true gentility, untainted\nin blood and understanding.--Some faults of temper John Knightley had;\nbut Isabella had connected herself unexceptionably. She had given them\nneither men, nor names, nor places, that could raise a blush. These were\npleasant feelings, and she walked about and indulged them till it\nwas necessary to do as the others did, and collect round the\nstrawberry-beds.--The whole party were assembled, excepting Frank\nChurchill, who was expected every moment from Richmond; and Mrs. Elton,\nin all her apparatus of happiness, her large bonnet and her basket,\nwas very ready to lead the way in gathering, accepting, or\ntalking--strawberries, and only strawberries, could now be thought or\nspoken of.--“The best fruit in England--every body's favourite--always\nwholesome.--These the finest beds and finest sorts.--Delightful to\ngather for one's self--the only way of really enjoying them.--Morning\ndecidedly the best time--never tired--every sort good--hautboy\ninfinitely superior--no comparison--the others hardly eatable--hautboys\nvery scarce--Chili preferred--white wood finest flavour of all--price\nof strawberries in London--abundance about Bristol--Maple\nGrove--cultivation--beds when to be renewed--gardeners thinking exactly\ndifferent--no general rule--gardeners never to be put out of their\nway--delicious fruit--only too rich to be eaten much of--inferior\nto cherries--currants more refreshing--only objection to gathering\nstrawberries the stooping--glaring sun--tired to death--could bear it no\nlonger--must go and sit in the shade.”\n\nSuch, for half an hour, was the conversation--interrupted only once by\nMrs. Weston, who came out, in her solicitude after her son-in-law, to\ninquire if he were come--and she was a little uneasy.--She had some\nfears of his horse.\n\nSeats tolerably in the shade were found; and now Emma was obliged\nto overhear what Mrs. Elton and Jane Fairfax were talking of.--A\nsituation, a most desirable situation, was in question. Mrs. Elton had\nreceived notice of it that morning, and was in raptures. It was not\nwith Mrs. Suckling, it was not with Mrs. Bragge, but in felicity and\nsplendour it fell short only of them: it was with a cousin of Mrs.\nBragge, an acquaintance of Mrs. Suckling, a lady known at Maple Grove.\nDelightful, charming, superior, first circles, spheres, lines, ranks,\nevery thing--and Mrs. Elton was wild to have the offer closed with\nimmediately.--On her side, all was warmth, energy, and triumph--and she\npositively refused to take her friend's negative, though Miss Fairfax\ncontinued to assure her that she would not at present engage in any\nthing, repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge\nbefore.--Still Mrs. Elton insisted on being authorised to write an\nacquiescence by the morrow's post.--How Jane could bear it at all, was\nastonishing to Emma.--She did look vexed, she did speak pointedly--and\nat last, with a decision of action unusual to her, proposed a\nremoval.--“Should not they walk? Would not Mr. Knightley shew them the\ngardens--all the gardens?--She wished to see the whole extent.”--The\npertinacity of her friend seemed more than she could bear.\n\nIt was hot; and after walking some time over the gardens in a scattered,\ndispersed way, scarcely any three together, they insensibly followed one\nanother to the delicious shade of a broad short avenue of limes, which\nstretching beyond the garden at an equal distance from the river, seemed\nthe finish of the pleasure grounds.--It led to nothing; nothing but a\nview at the end over a low stone wall with high pillars, which seemed\nintended, in their erection, to give the appearance of an approach to\nthe house, which never had been there. Disputable, however, as might be\nthe taste of such a termination, it was in itself a charming walk, and\nthe view which closed it extremely pretty.--The considerable slope, at\nnearly the foot of which the Abbey stood, gradually acquired a steeper\nform beyond its grounds; and at half a mile distant was a bank of\nconsiderable abruptness and grandeur, well clothed with wood;--and at\nthe bottom of this bank, favourably placed and sheltered, rose the\nAbbey Mill Farm, with meadows in front, and the river making a close and\nhandsome curve around it.\n\nIt was a sweet view--sweet to the eye and the mind. English verdure,\nEnglish culture, English comfort, seen under a sun bright, without being\noppressive.\n\nIn this walk Emma and Mr. Weston found all the others assembled; and\ntowards this view she immediately perceived Mr. Knightley and Harriet\ndistinct from the rest, quietly leading the way. Mr. Knightley and\nHarriet!--It was an odd tete-a-tete; but she was glad to see it.--There\nhad been a time when he would have scorned her as a companion, and\nturned from her with little ceremony. Now they seemed in pleasant\nconversation. There had been a time also when Emma would have been sorry\nto see Harriet in a spot so favourable for the Abbey Mill Farm; but now\nshe feared it not. It might be safely viewed with all its appendages of\nprosperity and beauty, its rich pastures, spreading flocks, orchard in\nblossom, and light column of smoke ascending.--She joined them at the\nwall, and found them more engaged in talking than in looking around. He\nwas giving Harriet information as to modes of agriculture, etc. and Emma\nreceived a smile which seemed to say, “These are my own concerns. I have\na right to talk on such subjects, without being suspected of\nintroducing Robert Martin.”--She did not suspect him. It was too old\na story.--Robert Martin had probably ceased to think of Harriet.--They\ntook a few turns together along the walk.--The shade was most\nrefreshing, and Emma found it the pleasantest part of the day.\n\nThe next remove was to the house; they must all go in and eat;--and they\nwere all seated and busy, and still Frank Churchill did not come. Mrs.\nWeston looked, and looked in vain. His father would not own himself\nuneasy, and laughed at her fears; but she could not be cured of wishing\nthat he would part with his black mare. He had expressed himself as to\ncoming, with more than common certainty. “His aunt was so much better,\nthat he had not a doubt of getting over to them.”--Mrs. Churchill's\nstate, however, as many were ready to remind her, was liable to such\nsudden variation as might disappoint her nephew in the most reasonable\ndependence--and Mrs. Weston was at last persuaded to believe, or to say,\nthat it must be by some attack of Mrs. Churchill that he was\nprevented coming.--Emma looked at Harriet while the point was under\nconsideration; she behaved very well, and betrayed no emotion.\n\nThe cold repast was over, and the party were to go out once more to see\nwhat had not yet been seen, the old Abbey fish-ponds; perhaps get as far\nas the clover, which was to be begun cutting on the morrow, or, at\nany rate, have the pleasure of being hot, and growing cool again.--Mr.\nWoodhouse, who had already taken his little round in the highest part\nof the gardens, where no damps from the river were imagined even by him,\nstirred no more; and his daughter resolved to remain with him, that\nMrs. Weston might be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise and\nvariety which her spirits seemed to need.\n\nMr. Knightley had done all in his power for Mr. Woodhouse's\nentertainment. Books of engravings, drawers of medals, cameos, corals,\nshells, and every other family collection within his cabinets, had been\nprepared for his old friend, to while away the morning; and the kindness\nhad perfectly answered. Mr. Woodhouse had been exceedingly well amused.\nMrs. Weston had been shewing them all to him, and now he would shew them\nall to Emma;--fortunate in having no other resemblance to a child, than\nin a total want of taste for what he saw, for he was slow, constant, and\nmethodical.--Before this second looking over was begun, however, Emma\nwalked into the hall for the sake of a few moments' free observation of\nthe entrance and ground-plot of the house--and was hardly there, when\nJane Fairfax appeared, coming quickly in from the garden, and with a\nlook of escape.--Little expecting to meet Miss Woodhouse so soon, there\nwas a start at first; but Miss Woodhouse was the very person she was in\nquest of.\n\n“Will you be so kind,” said she, “when I am missed, as to say that I am\ngone home?--I am going this moment.--My aunt is not aware how late it\nis, nor how long we have been absent--but I am sure we shall be wanted,\nand I am determined to go directly.--I have said nothing about it to any\nbody. It would only be giving trouble and distress. Some are gone to the\nponds, and some to the lime walk. Till they all come in I shall not be\nmissed; and when they do, will you have the goodness to say that I am\ngone?”\n\n“Certainly, if you wish it;--but you are not going to walk to Highbury\nalone?”\n\n“Yes--what should hurt me?--I walk fast. I shall be at home in twenty\nminutes.”\n\n“But it is too far, indeed it is, to be walking quite alone. Let my\nfather's servant go with you.--Let me order the carriage. It can be\nround in five minutes.”\n\n“Thank you, thank you--but on no account.--I would rather walk.--And\nfor _me_ to be afraid of walking alone!--I, who may so soon have to\nguard others!”\n\nShe spoke with great agitation; and Emma very feelingly replied, “That\ncan be no reason for your being exposed to danger now. I must order the\ncarriage. The heat even would be danger.--You are fatigued already.”\n\n“I am,”--she answered--“I am fatigued; but it is not the sort of\nfatigue--quick walking will refresh me.--Miss Woodhouse, we all know\nat times what it is to be wearied in spirits. Mine, I confess, are\nexhausted. The greatest kindness you can shew me, will be to let me have\nmy own way, and only say that I am gone when it is necessary.”\n\nEmma had not another word to oppose. She saw it all; and entering into\nher feelings, promoted her quitting the house immediately, and\nwatched her safely off with the zeal of a friend. Her parting look was\ngrateful--and her parting words, “Oh! Miss Woodhouse, the comfort of\nbeing sometimes alone!”--seemed to burst from an overcharged heart, and\nto describe somewhat of the continual endurance to be practised by her,\neven towards some of those who loved her best.\n\n“Such a home, indeed! such an aunt!” said Emma, as she turned back into\nthe hall again. “I do pity you. And the more sensibility you betray of\ntheir just horrors, the more I shall like you.”\n\nJane had not been gone a quarter of an hour, and they had only\naccomplished some views of St. Mark's Place, Venice, when Frank\nChurchill entered the room. Emma had not been thinking of him, she had\nforgotten to think of him--but she was very glad to see him. Mrs. Weston\nwould be at ease. The black mare was blameless; _they_ were right\nwho had named Mrs. Churchill as the cause. He had been detained by\na temporary increase of illness in her; a nervous seizure, which had\nlasted some hours--and he had quite given up every thought of coming,\ntill very late;--and had he known how hot a ride he should have, and\nhow late, with all his hurry, he must be, he believed he should not have\ncome at all. The heat was excessive; he had never suffered any thing\nlike it--almost wished he had staid at home--nothing killed him\nlike heat--he could bear any degree of cold, etc., but heat was\nintolerable--and he sat down, at the greatest possible distance from the\nslight remains of Mr. Woodhouse's fire, looking very deplorable.\n\n“You will soon be cooler, if you sit still,” said Emma.\n\n“As soon as I am cooler I shall go back again. I could very ill be\nspared--but such a point had been made of my coming! You will all be\ngoing soon I suppose; the whole party breaking up. I met _one_ as I\ncame--Madness in such weather!--absolute madness!”\n\nEmma listened, and looked, and soon perceived that Frank Churchill's\nstate might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out of\nhumour. Some people were always cross when they were hot. Such might be\nhis constitution; and as she knew that eating and drinking were often\nthe cure of such incidental complaints, she recommended his taking\nsome refreshment; he would find abundance of every thing in the\ndining-room--and she humanely pointed out the door.\n\n“No--he should not eat. He was not hungry; it would only make him\nhotter.” In two minutes, however, he relented in his own favour; and\nmuttering something about spruce-beer, walked off. Emma returned all her\nattention to her father, saying in secret--\n\n“I am glad I have done being in love with him. I should not like a man\nwho is so soon discomposed by a hot morning. Harriet's sweet easy temper\nwill not mind it.”\n\nHe was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal, and came\nback all the better--grown quite cool--and, with good manners, like\nhimself--able to draw a chair close to them, take an interest in their\nemployment; and regret, in a reasonable way, that he should be so late.\nHe was not in his best spirits, but seemed trying to improve them; and,\nat last, made himself talk nonsense very agreeably. They were looking\nover views in Swisserland.\n\n“As soon as my aunt gets well, I shall go abroad,” said he. “I shall\nnever be easy till I have seen some of these places. You will have my\nsketches, some time or other, to look at--or my tour to read--or my\npoem. I shall do something to expose myself.”\n\n“That may be--but not by sketches in Swisserland. You will never go to\nSwisserland. Your uncle and aunt will never allow you to leave England.”\n\n“They may be induced to go too. A warm climate may be prescribed for\nher. I have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad. I\nassure you I have. I feel a strong persuasion, this morning, that I\nshall soon be abroad. I ought to travel. I am tired of doing nothing. I\nwant a change. I am serious, Miss Woodhouse, whatever your penetrating\neyes may fancy--I am sick of England--and would leave it to-morrow, if\nI could.”\n\n“You are sick of prosperity and indulgence. Cannot you invent a few\nhardships for yourself, and be contented to stay?”\n\n“_I_ sick of prosperity and indulgence! You are quite mistaken. I do\nnot look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged. I am thwarted\nin every thing material. I do not consider myself at all a fortunate\nperson.”\n\n“You are not quite so miserable, though, as when you first came. Go and\neat and drink a little more, and you will do very well. Another slice of\ncold meat, another draught of Madeira and water, will make you nearly on\na par with the rest of us.”\n\n“No--I shall not stir. I shall sit by you. You are my best cure.”\n\n“We are going to Box Hill to-morrow;--you will join us. It is not\nSwisserland, but it will be something for a young man so much in want of\na change. You will stay, and go with us?”\n\n“No, certainly not; I shall go home in the cool of the evening.”\n\n“But you may come again in the cool of to-morrow morning.”\n\n“No--It will not be worth while. If I come, I shall be cross.”\n\n“Then pray stay at Richmond.”\n\n“But if I do, I shall be crosser still. I can never bear to think of you\nall there without me.”\n\n“These are difficulties which you must settle for yourself. Chuse your\nown degree of crossness. I shall press you no more.”\n\nThe rest of the party were now returning, and all were soon collected.\nWith some there was great joy at the sight of Frank Churchill; others\ntook it very composedly; but there was a very general distress and\ndisturbance on Miss Fairfax's disappearance being explained. That it was\ntime for every body to go, concluded the subject; and with a short final\narrangement for the next day's scheme, they parted. Frank Churchill's\nlittle inclination to exclude himself increased so much, that his last\nwords to Emma were,\n\n“Well;--if _you_ wish me to stay and join the party, I will.”\n\nShe smiled her acceptance; and nothing less than a summons from Richmond\nwas to take him back before the following evening.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nThey had a very fine day for Box Hill; and all the other outward\ncircumstances of arrangement, accommodation, and punctuality, were in\nfavour of a pleasant party. Mr. Weston directed the whole, officiating\nsafely between Hartfield and the Vicarage, and every body was in good\ntime. Emma and Harriet went together; Miss Bates and her niece, with\nthe Eltons; the gentlemen on horseback. Mrs. Weston remained with Mr.\nWoodhouse. Nothing was wanting but to be happy when they got there.\nSeven miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment, and every body\nhad a burst of admiration on first arriving; but in the general amount\nof the day there was deficiency. There was a languor, a want of spirits,\na want of union, which could not be got over. They separated too much\ninto parties. The Eltons walked together; Mr. Knightley took charge of\nMiss Bates and Jane; and Emma and Harriet belonged to Frank Churchill.\nAnd Mr. Weston tried, in vain, to make them harmonise better. It seemed\nat first an accidental division, but it never materially varied. Mr. and\nMrs. Elton, indeed, shewed no unwillingness to mix, and be as agreeable\nas they could; but during the two whole hours that were spent on the\nhill, there seemed a principle of separation, between the other parties,\ntoo strong for any fine prospects, or any cold collation, or any\ncheerful Mr. Weston, to remove.\n\nAt first it was downright dulness to Emma. She had never seen Frank\nChurchill so silent and stupid. He said nothing worth hearing--looked\nwithout seeing--admired without intelligence--listened without knowing\nwhat she said. While he was so dull, it was no wonder that Harriet\nshould be dull likewise; and they were both insufferable.\n\nWhen they all sat down it was better; to her taste a great deal better,\nfor Frank Churchill grew talkative and gay, making her his first object.\nEvery distinguishing attention that could be paid, was paid to her.\nTo amuse her, and be agreeable in her eyes, seemed all that he cared\nfor--and Emma, glad to be enlivened, not sorry to be flattered, was gay\nand easy too, and gave him all the friendly encouragement, the admission\nto be gallant, which she had ever given in the first and most animating\nperiod of their acquaintance; but which now, in her own estimation,\nmeant nothing, though in the judgment of most people looking on it must\nhave had such an appearance as no English word but flirtation could very\nwell describe. “Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse flirted together\nexcessively.” They were laying themselves open to that very phrase--and\nto having it sent off in a letter to Maple Grove by one lady, to\nIreland by another. Not that Emma was gay and thoughtless from any\nreal felicity; it was rather because she felt less happy than she had\nexpected. She laughed because she was disappointed; and though she liked\nhim for his attentions, and thought them all, whether in friendship,\nadmiration, or playfulness, extremely judicious, they were not winning\nback her heart. She still intended him for her friend.\n\n“How much I am obliged to you,” said he, “for telling me to come\nto-day!--If it had not been for you, I should certainly have lost all\nthe happiness of this party. I had quite determined to go away again.”\n\n“Yes, you were very cross; and I do not know what about, except that you\nwere too late for the best strawberries. I was a kinder friend than you\ndeserved. But you were humble. You begged hard to be commanded to come.”\n\n“Don't say I was cross. I was fatigued. The heat overcame me.”\n\n“It is hotter to-day.”\n\n“Not to my feelings. I am perfectly comfortable to-day.”\n\n“You are comfortable because you are under command.”\n\n“Your command?--Yes.”\n\n“Perhaps I intended you to say so, but I meant self-command. You had,\nsomehow or other, broken bounds yesterday, and run away from your own\nmanagement; but to-day you are got back again--and as I cannot be always\nwith you, it is best to believe your temper under your own command\nrather than mine.”\n\n“It comes to the same thing. I can have no self-command without a\nmotive. You order me, whether you speak or not. And you can be always\nwith me. You are always with me.”\n\n“Dating from three o'clock yesterday. My perpetual influence could not\nbegin earlier, or you would not have been so much out of humour before.”\n\n“Three o'clock yesterday! That is your date. I thought I had seen you\nfirst in February.”\n\n“Your gallantry is really unanswerable. But (lowering her voice)--nobody\nspeaks except ourselves, and it is rather too much to be talking\nnonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people.”\n\n“I say nothing of which I am ashamed,” replied he, with lively\nimpudence. “I saw you first in February. Let every body on the Hill\nhear me if they can. Let my accents swell to Mickleham on one side,\nand Dorking on the other. I saw you first in February.” And then\nwhispering--“Our companions are excessively stupid. What shall we do\nto rouse them? Any nonsense will serve. They _shall_ talk. Ladies\nand gentlemen, I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse (who, wherever she is,\npresides) to say, that she desires to know what you are all thinking\nof?”\n\nSome laughed, and answered good-humouredly. Miss Bates said a great\ndeal; Mrs. Elton swelled at the idea of Miss Woodhouse's presiding; Mr.\nKnightley's answer was the most distinct.\n\n“Is Miss Woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all\nthinking of?”\n\n“Oh! no, no”--cried Emma, laughing as carelessly as she could--“Upon no\naccount in the world. It is the very last thing I would stand the brunt\nof just now. Let me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking\nof. I will not say quite all. There are one or two, perhaps, (glancing\nat Mr. Weston and Harriet,) whose thoughts I might not be afraid of\nknowing.”\n\n“It is a sort of thing,” cried Mrs. Elton emphatically, “which _I_\nshould not have thought myself privileged to inquire into. Though,\nperhaps, as the _Chaperon_ of the party--_I_ never was in any\ncircle--exploring parties--young ladies--married women--”\n\nHer mutterings were chiefly to her husband; and he murmured, in reply,\n\n“Very true, my love, very true. Exactly so, indeed--quite unheard\nof--but some ladies say any thing. Better pass it off as a joke. Every\nbody knows what is due to _you_.”\n\n“It will not do,” whispered Frank to Emma; “they are most of them\naffronted. I will attack them with more address. Ladies and gentlemen--I\nam ordered by Miss Woodhouse to say, that she waives her right of\nknowing exactly what you may all be thinking of, and only requires\nsomething very entertaining from each of you, in a general way. Here\nare seven of you, besides myself, (who, she is pleased to say, am very\nentertaining already,) and she only demands from each of you either one\nthing very clever, be it prose or verse, original or repeated--or two\nthings moderately clever--or three things very dull indeed, and she\nengages to laugh heartily at them all.”\n\n“Oh! very well,” exclaimed Miss Bates, “then I need not be uneasy.\n'Three things very dull indeed.' That will just do for me, you know. I\nshall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever I open my mouth,\nshan't I? (looking round with the most good-humoured dependence on every\nbody's assent)--Do not you all think I shall?”\n\nEmma could not resist.\n\n“Ah! ma'am, but there may be a difficulty. Pardon me--but you will be\nlimited as to number--only three at once.”\n\nMiss Bates, deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner, did not\nimmediately catch her meaning; but, when it burst on her, it could not\nanger, though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her.\n\n“Ah!--well--to be sure. Yes, I see what she means, (turning to Mr.\nKnightley,) and I will try to hold my tongue. I must make myself very\ndisagreeable, or she would not have said such a thing to an old friend.”\n\n“I like your plan,” cried Mr. Weston. “Agreed, agreed. I will do my\nbest. I am making a conundrum. How will a conundrum reckon?”\n\n“Low, I am afraid, sir, very low,” answered his son;--“but we shall be\nindulgent--especially to any one who leads the way.”\n\n“No, no,” said Emma, “it will not reckon low. A conundrum of Mr.\nWeston's shall clear him and his next neighbour. Come, sir, pray let me\nhear it.”\n\n“I doubt its being very clever myself,” said Mr. Weston. “It is too much\na matter of fact, but here it is.--What two letters of the alphabet are\nthere, that express perfection?”\n\n“What two letters!--express perfection! I am sure I do not know.”\n\n“Ah! you will never guess. You, (to Emma), I am certain, will never\nguess.--I will tell you.--M. and A.--Em-ma.--Do you understand?”\n\nUnderstanding and gratification came together. It might be a very\nindifferent piece of wit, but Emma found a great deal to laugh at and\nenjoy in it--and so did Frank and Harriet.--It did not seem to touch\nthe rest of the party equally; some looked very stupid about it, and Mr.\nKnightley gravely said,\n\n“This explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted, and Mr. Weston\nhas done very well for himself; but he must have knocked up every body\nelse. _Perfection_ should not have come quite so soon.”\n\n“Oh! for myself, I protest I must be excused,” said Mrs. Elton; “_I_\nreally cannot attempt--I am not at all fond of the sort of thing. I had\nan acrostic once sent to me upon my own name, which I was not at all\npleased with. I knew who it came from. An abominable puppy!--You know\nwho I mean (nodding to her husband). These kind of things are very\nwell at Christmas, when one is sitting round the fire; but quite out of\nplace, in my opinion, when one is exploring about the country in summer.\nMiss Woodhouse must excuse me. I am not one of those who have witty\nthings at every body's service. I do not pretend to be a wit. I have a\ngreat deal of vivacity in my own way, but I really must be allowed to\njudge when to speak and when to hold my tongue. Pass us, if you please,\nMr. Churchill. Pass Mr. E., Knightley, Jane, and myself. We have nothing\nclever to say--not one of us.\n\n“Yes, yes, pray pass _me_,” added her husband, with a sort of sneering\nconsciousness; “_I_ have nothing to say that can entertain Miss\nWoodhouse, or any other young lady. An old married man--quite good for\nnothing. Shall we walk, Augusta?”\n\n“With all my heart. I am really tired of exploring so long on one spot.\nCome, Jane, take my other arm.”\n\nJane declined it, however, and the husband and wife walked off.\n“Happy couple!” said Frank Churchill, as soon as they were out of\nhearing:--“How well they suit one another!--Very lucky--marrying as they\ndid, upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place!--They only knew\neach other, I think, a few weeks in Bath! Peculiarly lucky!--for as to\nany real knowledge of a person's disposition that Bath, or any public\nplace, can give--it is all nothing; there can be no knowledge. It is\nonly by seeing women in their own homes, among their own set, just as\nthey always are, that you can form any just judgment. Short of that, it\nis all guess and luck--and will generally be ill-luck. How many a man\nhas committed himself on a short acquaintance, and rued it all the rest\nof his life!”\n\nMiss Fairfax, who had seldom spoken before, except among her own\nconfederates, spoke now.\n\n“Such things do occur, undoubtedly.”--She was stopped by a cough. Frank\nChurchill turned towards her to listen.\n\n“You were speaking,” said he, gravely. She recovered her voice.\n\n“I was only going to observe, that though such unfortunate circumstances\ndo sometimes occur both to men and women, I cannot imagine them to be\nvery frequent. A hasty and imprudent attachment may arise--but there is\ngenerally time to recover from it afterwards. I would be understood to\nmean, that it can be only weak, irresolute characters, (whose happiness\nmust be always at the mercy of chance,) who will suffer an unfortunate\nacquaintance to be an inconvenience, an oppression for ever.”\n\nHe made no answer; merely looked, and bowed in submission; and soon\nafterwards said, in a lively tone,\n\n“Well, I have so little confidence in my own judgment, that whenever I\nmarry, I hope some body will chuse my wife for me. Will you? (turning to\nEmma.) Will you chuse a wife for me?--I am sure I should like any body\nfixed on by you. You provide for the family, you know, (with a smile at\nhis father). Find some body for me. I am in no hurry. Adopt her, educate\nher.”\n\n“And make her like myself.”\n\n“By all means, if you can.”\n\n“Very well. I undertake the commission. You shall have a charming wife.”\n\n“She must be very lively, and have hazle eyes. I care for nothing else.\nI shall go abroad for a couple of years--and when I return, I shall come\nto you for my wife. Remember.”\n\nEmma was in no danger of forgetting. It was a commission to touch every\nfavourite feeling. Would not Harriet be the very creature described?\nHazle eyes excepted, two years more might make her all that he wished.\nHe might even have Harriet in his thoughts at the moment; who could say?\nReferring the education to her seemed to imply it.\n\n“Now, ma'am,” said Jane to her aunt, “shall we join Mrs. Elton?”\n\n“If you please, my dear. With all my heart. I am quite ready. I was\nready to have gone with her, but this will do just as well. We shall\nsoon overtake her. There she is--no, that's somebody else. That's one\nof the ladies in the Irish car party, not at all like her.--Well, I\ndeclare--”\n\nThey walked off, followed in half a minute by Mr. Knightley. Mr. Weston,\nhis son, Emma, and Harriet, only remained; and the young man's spirits\nnow rose to a pitch almost unpleasant. Even Emma grew tired at last of\nflattery and merriment, and wished herself rather walking quietly about\nwith any of the others, or sitting almost alone, and quite unattended\nto, in tranquil observation of the beautiful views beneath her. The\nappearance of the servants looking out for them to give notice of the\ncarriages was a joyful sight; and even the bustle of collecting and\npreparing to depart, and the solicitude of Mrs. Elton to have _her_\ncarriage first, were gladly endured, in the prospect of the quiet drive\nhome which was to close the very questionable enjoyments of this day of\npleasure. Such another scheme, composed of so many ill-assorted people,\nshe hoped never to be betrayed into again.\n\nWhile waiting for the carriage, she found Mr. Knightley by her side. He\nlooked around, as if to see that no one were near, and then said,\n\n“Emma, I must once more speak to you as I have been used to do: a\nprivilege rather endured than allowed, perhaps, but I must still use it.\nI cannot see you acting wrong, without a remonstrance. How could you be\nso unfeeling to Miss Bates? How could you be so insolent in your wit to\na woman of her character, age, and situation?--Emma, I had not thought\nit possible.”\n\nEmma recollected, blushed, was sorry, but tried to laugh it off.\n\n“Nay, how could I help saying what I did?--Nobody could have helped it.\nIt was not so very bad. I dare say she did not understand me.”\n\n“I assure you she did. She felt your full meaning. She has talked of\nit since. I wish you could have heard how she talked of it--with what\ncandour and generosity. I wish you could have heard her honouring your\nforbearance, in being able to pay her such attentions, as she was for\never receiving from yourself and your father, when her society must be\nso irksome.”\n\n“Oh!” cried Emma, “I know there is not a better creature in the world:\nbut you must allow, that what is good and what is ridiculous are most\nunfortunately blended in her.”\n\n“They are blended,” said he, “I acknowledge; and, were she prosperous,\nI could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over\nthe good. Were she a woman of fortune, I would leave every harmless\nabsurdity to take its chance, I would not quarrel with you for any\nliberties of manner. Were she your equal in situation--but, Emma,\nconsider how far this is from being the case. She is poor; she has sunk\nfrom the comforts she was born to; and, if she live to old age, must\nprobably sink more. Her situation should secure your compassion. It was\nbadly done, indeed! You, whom she had known from an infant, whom she had\nseen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour, to have you\nnow, in thoughtless spirits, and the pride of the moment, laugh at her,\nhumble her--and before her niece, too--and before others, many of whom\n(certainly _some_,) would be entirely guided by _your_ treatment\nof her.--This is not pleasant to you, Emma--and it is very far from\npleasant to me; but I must, I will,--I will tell you truths while I can;\nsatisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel, and\ntrusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you\ncan do now.”\n\nWhile they talked, they were advancing towards the carriage; it was\nready; and, before she could speak again, he had handed her in. He had\nmisinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted, and her\ntongue motionless. They were combined only of anger against herself,\nmortification, and deep concern. She had not been able to speak; and, on\nentering the carriage, sunk back for a moment overcome--then reproaching\nherself for having taken no leave, making no acknowledgment, parting in\napparent sullenness, she looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a\ndifference; but it was just too late. He had turned away, and the horses\nwere in motion. She continued to look back, but in vain; and soon, with\nwhat appeared unusual speed, they were half way down the hill, and\nevery thing left far behind. She was vexed beyond what could have been\nexpressed--almost beyond what she could conceal. Never had she felt so\nagitated, mortified, grieved, at any circumstance in her life. She was\nmost forcibly struck. The truth of this representation there was no\ndenying. She felt it at her heart. How could she have been so brutal,\nso cruel to Miss Bates! How could she have exposed herself to such ill\nopinion in any one she valued! And how suffer him to leave her without\nsaying one word of gratitude, of concurrence, of common kindness!\n\nTime did not compose her. As she reflected more, she seemed but to feel\nit more. She never had been so depressed. Happily it was not necessary\nto speak. There was only Harriet, who seemed not in spirits herself,\nfagged, and very willing to be silent; and Emma felt the tears running\ndown her cheeks almost all the way home, without being at any trouble to\ncheck them, extraordinary as they were.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nThe wretchedness of a scheme to Box Hill was in Emma's thoughts all the\nevening. How it might be considered by the rest of the party, she could\nnot tell. They, in their different homes, and their different ways,\nmight be looking back on it with pleasure; but in her view it was\na morning more completely misspent, more totally bare of rational\nsatisfaction at the time, and more to be abhorred in recollection, than\nany she had ever passed. A whole evening of back-gammon with her father,\nwas felicity to it. _There_, indeed, lay real pleasure, for there she\nwas giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty-four to his comfort; and\nfeeling that, unmerited as might be the degree of his fond affection and\nconfiding esteem, she could not, in her general conduct, be open to any\nsevere reproach. As a daughter, she hoped she was not without a heart.\nShe hoped no one could have said to her, “How could you be so unfeeling\nto your father?--I must, I will tell you truths while I can.” Miss\nBates should never again--no, never! If attention, in future, could do\naway the past, she might hope to be forgiven. She had been often remiss,\nher conscience told her so; remiss, perhaps, more in thought than fact;\nscornful, ungracious. But it should be so no more. In the warmth of true\ncontrition, she would call upon her the very next morning, and it should\nbe the beginning, on her side, of a regular, equal, kindly intercourse.\n\nShe was just as determined when the morrow came, and went early, that\nnothing might prevent her. It was not unlikely, she thought, that she\nmight see Mr. Knightley in her way; or, perhaps, he might come in\nwhile she were paying her visit. She had no objection. She would not be\nashamed of the appearance of the penitence, so justly and truly hers.\nHer eyes were towards Donwell as she walked, but she saw him not.\n\n“The ladies were all at home.” She had never rejoiced at the sound\nbefore, nor ever before entered the passage, nor walked up the stairs,\nwith any wish of giving pleasure, but in conferring obligation, or of\nderiving it, except in subsequent ridicule.\n\nThere was a bustle on her approach; a good deal of moving and talking.\nShe heard Miss Bates's voice, something was to be done in a hurry; the\nmaid looked frightened and awkward; hoped she would be pleased to wait a\nmoment, and then ushered her in too soon. The aunt and niece seemed both\nescaping into the adjoining room. Jane she had a distinct glimpse of,\nlooking extremely ill; and, before the door had shut them out, she heard\nMiss Bates saying, “Well, my dear, I shall _say_ you are laid down upon\nthe bed, and I am sure you are ill enough.”\n\nPoor old Mrs. Bates, civil and humble as usual, looked as if she did not\nquite understand what was going on.\n\n“I am afraid Jane is not very well,” said she, “but I do not know; they\n_tell_ me she is well. I dare say my daughter will be here presently,\nMiss Woodhouse. I hope you find a chair. I wish Hetty had not gone. I am\nvery little able--Have you a chair, ma'am? Do you sit where you like? I\nam sure she will be here presently.”\n\nEmma seriously hoped she would. She had a moment's fear of Miss Bates\nkeeping away from her. But Miss Bates soon came--“Very happy and\nobliged”--but Emma's conscience told her that there was not the same\ncheerful volubility as before--less ease of look and manner. A very\nfriendly inquiry after Miss Fairfax, she hoped, might lead the way to a\nreturn of old feelings. The touch seemed immediate.\n\n“Ah! Miss Woodhouse, how kind you are!--I suppose you have heard--and\nare come to give us joy. This does not seem much like joy, indeed, in\nme--(twinkling away a tear or two)--but it will be very trying for us\nto part with her, after having had her so long, and she has a dreadful\nheadache just now, writing all the morning:--such long letters, you\nknow, to be written to Colonel Campbell, and Mrs. Dixon. 'My dear,' said\nI, 'you will blind yourself'--for tears were in her eyes perpetually.\nOne cannot wonder, one cannot wonder. It is a great change; and though\nshe is amazingly fortunate--such a situation, I suppose, as no\nyoung woman before ever met with on first going out--do not think us\nungrateful, Miss Woodhouse, for such surprising good fortune--(again\ndispersing her tears)--but, poor dear soul! if you were to see what a\nheadache she has. When one is in great pain, you know one cannot feel\nany blessing quite as it may deserve. She is as low as possible. To\nlook at her, nobody would think how delighted and happy she is to have\nsecured such a situation. You will excuse her not coming to you--she is\nnot able--she is gone into her own room--I want her to lie down upon the\nbed. 'My dear,' said I, 'I shall say you are laid down upon the bed:'\nbut, however, she is not; she is walking about the room. But, now that\nshe has written her letters, she says she shall soon be well. She will\nbe extremely sorry to miss seeing you, Miss Woodhouse, but your\nkindness will excuse her. You were kept waiting at the door--I was quite\nashamed--but somehow there was a little bustle--for it so happened that\nwe had not heard the knock, and till you were on the stairs, we did not\nknow any body was coming. 'It is only Mrs. Cole,' said I, 'depend upon\nit. Nobody else would come so early.' 'Well,' said she, 'it must be\nborne some time or other, and it may as well be now.' But then Patty\ncame in, and said it was you. 'Oh!' said I, 'it is Miss Woodhouse: I am\nsure you will like to see her.'--'I can see nobody,' said she; and\nup she got, and would go away; and that was what made us keep you\nwaiting--and extremely sorry and ashamed we were. 'If you must go, my\ndear,' said I, 'you must, and I will say you are laid down upon the\nbed.'”\n\nEmma was most sincerely interested. Her heart had been long growing\nkinder towards Jane; and this picture of her present sufferings acted\nas a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion, and left her nothing but\npity; and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle sensations of\nthe past, obliged her to admit that Jane might very naturally resolve on\nseeing Mrs. Cole or any other steady friend, when she might not bear\nto see herself. She spoke as she felt, with earnest regret and\nsolicitude--sincerely wishing that the circumstances which she collected\nfrom Miss Bates to be now actually determined on, might be as much for\nMiss Fairfax's advantage and comfort as possible. “It must be a severe\ntrial to them all. She had understood it was to be delayed till Colonel\nCampbell's return.”\n\n“So very kind!” replied Miss Bates. “But you are always kind.”\n\nThere was no bearing such an “always;” and to break through her dreadful\ngratitude, Emma made the direct inquiry of--\n\n“Where--may I ask?--is Miss Fairfax going?”\n\n“To a Mrs. Smallridge--charming woman--most superior--to have the charge\nof her three little girls--delightful children. Impossible that any\nsituation could be more replete with comfort; if we except, perhaps,\nMrs. Suckling's own family, and Mrs. Bragge's; but Mrs. Smallridge is\nintimate with both, and in the very same neighbourhood:--lives only four\nmiles from Maple Grove. Jane will be only four miles from Maple Grove.”\n\n“Mrs. Elton, I suppose, has been the person to whom Miss Fairfax owes--”\n\n“Yes, our good Mrs. Elton. The most indefatigable, true friend. She\nwould not take a denial. She would not let Jane say, 'No;' for when Jane\nfirst heard of it, (it was the day before yesterday, the very morning\nwe were at Donwell,) when Jane first heard of it, she was quite decided\nagainst accepting the offer, and for the reasons you mention; exactly\nas you say, she had made up her mind to close with nothing till Colonel\nCampbell's return, and nothing should induce her to enter into any\nengagement at present--and so she told Mrs. Elton over and over\nagain--and I am sure I had no more idea that she would change her\nmind!--but that good Mrs. Elton, whose judgment never fails her, saw\nfarther than I did. It is not every body that would have stood out in\nsuch a kind way as she did, and refuse to take Jane's answer; but she\npositively declared she would _not_ write any such denial yesterday, as\nJane wished her; she would wait--and, sure enough, yesterday evening it\nwas all settled that Jane should go. Quite a surprize to me! I had not\nthe least idea!--Jane took Mrs. Elton aside, and told her at once, that\nupon thinking over the advantages of Mrs. Smallridge's situation, she\nhad come to the resolution of accepting it.--I did not know a word of it\ntill it was all settled.”\n\n“You spent the evening with Mrs. Elton?”\n\n“Yes, all of us; Mrs. Elton would have us come. It was settled so, upon\nthe hill, while we were walking about with Mr. Knightley. 'You _must_\n_all_ spend your evening with us,' said she--'I positively must have you\n_all_ come.'”\n\n“Mr. Knightley was there too, was he?”\n\n“No, not Mr. Knightley; he declined it from the first; and though I\nthought he would come, because Mrs. Elton declared she would not let him\noff, he did not;--but my mother, and Jane, and I, were all there, and\na very agreeable evening we had. Such kind friends, you know, Miss\nWoodhouse, one must always find agreeable, though every body seemed\nrather fagged after the morning's party. Even pleasure, you know, is\nfatiguing--and I cannot say that any of them seemed very much to have\nenjoyed it. However, _I_ shall always think it a very pleasant party,\nand feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it.”\n\n“Miss Fairfax, I suppose, though you were not aware of it, had been\nmaking up her mind the whole day?”\n\n“I dare say she had.”\n\n“Whenever the time may come, it must be unwelcome to her and all her\nfriends--but I hope her engagement will have every alleviation that is\npossible--I mean, as to the character and manners of the family.”\n\n“Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse. Yes, indeed, there is every thing\nin the world that can make her happy in it. Except the Sucklings and\nBragges, there is not such another nursery establishment, so liberal\nand elegant, in all Mrs. Elton's acquaintance. Mrs. Smallridge, a most\ndelightful woman!--A style of living almost equal to Maple Grove--and as\nto the children, except the little Sucklings and little Bragges, there\nare not such elegant sweet children anywhere. Jane will be treated with\nsuch regard and kindness!--It will be nothing but pleasure, a life of\npleasure.--And her salary!--I really cannot venture to name her salary\nto you, Miss Woodhouse. Even you, used as you are to great sums, would\nhardly believe that so much could be given to a young person like Jane.”\n\n“Ah! madam,” cried Emma, “if other children are at all like what I\nremember to have been myself, I should think five times the amount of\nwhat I have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions, dearly\nearned.”\n\n“You are so noble in your ideas!”\n\n“And when is Miss Fairfax to leave you?”\n\n“Very soon, very soon, indeed; that's the worst of it. Within a\nfortnight. Mrs. Smallridge is in a great hurry. My poor mother does not\nknow how to bear it. So then, I try to put it out of her thoughts, and\nsay, Come ma'am, do not let us think about it any more.”\n\n“Her friends must all be sorry to lose her; and will not Colonel and\nMrs. Campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself before their\nreturn?”\n\n“Yes; Jane says she is sure they will; but yet, this is such a situation\nas she cannot feel herself justified in declining. I was so astonished\nwhen she first told me what she had been saying to Mrs. Elton, and when\nMrs. Elton at the same moment came congratulating me upon it! It was\nbefore tea--stay--no, it could not be before tea, because we were\njust going to cards--and yet it was before tea, because I remember\nthinking--Oh! no, now I recollect, now I have it; something happened\nbefore tea, but not that. Mr. Elton was called out of the room before\ntea, old John Abdy's son wanted to speak with him. Poor old John, I\nhave a great regard for him; he was clerk to my poor father twenty-seven\nyears; and now, poor old man, he is bed-ridden, and very poorly with the\nrheumatic gout in his joints--I must go and see him to-day; and so will\nJane, I am sure, if she gets out at all. And poor John's son came to\ntalk to Mr. Elton about relief from the parish; he is very well to do\nhimself, you know, being head man at the Crown, ostler, and every thing\nof that sort, but still he cannot keep his father without some help;\nand so, when Mr. Elton came back, he told us what John ostler had been\ntelling him, and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to\nRandalls to take Mr. Frank Churchill to Richmond. That was what happened\nbefore tea. It was after tea that Jane spoke to Mrs. Elton.”\n\nMiss Bates would hardly give Emma time to say how perfectly new this\ncircumstance was to her; but as without supposing it possible that she\ncould be ignorant of any of the particulars of Mr. Frank Churchill's\ngoing, she proceeded to give them all, it was of no consequence.\n\nWhat Mr. Elton had learned from the ostler on the subject, being the\naccumulation of the ostler's own knowledge, and the knowledge of the\nservants at Randalls, was, that a messenger had come over from Richmond\nsoon after the return of the party from Box Hill--which messenger,\nhowever, had been no more than was expected; and that Mr. Churchill had\nsent his nephew a few lines, containing, upon the whole, a tolerable\naccount of Mrs. Churchill, and only wishing him not to delay coming\nback beyond the next morning early; but that Mr. Frank Churchill having\nresolved to go home directly, without waiting at all, and his horse\nseeming to have got a cold, Tom had been sent off immediately for the\nCrown chaise, and the ostler had stood out and seen it pass by, the boy\ngoing a good pace, and driving very steady.\n\nThere was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest, and it\ncaught Emma's attention only as it united with the subject which already\nengaged her mind. The contrast between Mrs. Churchill's importance in\nthe world, and Jane Fairfax's, struck her; one was every thing, the\nother nothing--and she sat musing on the difference of woman's destiny,\nand quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed, till roused by Miss\nBates's saying,\n\n“Aye, I see what you are thinking of, the pianoforte. What is to become\nof that?--Very true. Poor dear Jane was talking of it just now.--'You\nmust go,' said she. 'You and I must part. You will have no business\nhere.--Let it stay, however,' said she; 'give it houseroom till Colonel\nCampbell comes back. I shall talk about it to him; he will settle for\nme; he will help me out of all my difficulties.'--And to this day, I do\nbelieve, she knows not whether it was his present or his daughter's.”\n\nNow Emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte; and the remembrance of\nall her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing,\nthat she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been long enough;\nand, with a repetition of every thing that she could venture to say of\nthe good wishes which she really felt, took leave.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nEmma's pensive meditations, as she walked home, were not interrupted;\nbut on entering the parlour, she found those who must rouse her. Mr.\nKnightley and Harriet had arrived during her absence, and were sitting\nwith her father.--Mr. Knightley immediately got up, and in a manner\ndecidedly graver than usual, said,\n\n“I would not go away without seeing you, but I have no time to spare,\nand therefore must now be gone directly. I am going to London, to spend\na few days with John and Isabella. Have you any thing to send or say,\nbesides the 'love,' which nobody carries?”\n\n“Nothing at all. But is not this a sudden scheme?”\n\n“Yes--rather--I have been thinking of it some little time.”\n\nEmma was sure he had not forgiven her; he looked unlike himself. Time,\nhowever, she thought, would tell him that they ought to be friends\nagain. While he stood, as if meaning to go, but not going--her father\nbegan his inquiries.\n\n“Well, my dear, and did you get there safely?--And how did you find my\nworthy old friend and her daughter?--I dare say they must have been very\nmuch obliged to you for coming. Dear Emma has been to call on Mrs.\nand Miss Bates, Mr. Knightley, as I told you before. She is always so\nattentive to them!”\n\nEmma's colour was heightened by this unjust praise; and with a\nsmile, and shake of the head, which spoke much, she looked at Mr.\nKnightley.--It seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in\nher favour, as if his eyes received the truth from hers, and all that\nhad passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured.--\nHe looked at her with a glow of regard. She was warmly gratified--and in\nanother moment still more so, by a little movement of more than common\nfriendliness on his part.--He took her hand;--whether she had not\nherself made the first motion, she could not say--she might, perhaps,\nhave rather offered it--but he took her hand, pressed it, and certainly\nwas on the point of carrying it to his lips--when, from some fancy or\nother, he suddenly let it go.--Why he should feel such a scruple, why\nhe should change his mind when it was all but done, she could not\nperceive.--He would have judged better, she thought, if he had not\nstopped.--The intention, however, was indubitable; and whether it was\nthat his manners had in general so little gallantry, or however else it\nhappened, but she thought nothing became him more.--It was with him,\nof so simple, yet so dignified a nature.--She could not but recall the\nattempt with great satisfaction. It spoke such perfect amity.--He left\nthem immediately afterwards--gone in a moment. He always moved with the\nalertness of a mind which could neither be undecided nor dilatory, but\nnow he seemed more sudden than usual in his disappearance.\n\nEmma could not regret her having gone to Miss Bates, but she wished she\nhad left her ten minutes earlier;--it would have been a great pleasure\nto talk over Jane Fairfax's situation with Mr. Knightley.--Neither\nwould she regret that he should be going to Brunswick Square, for she\nknew how much his visit would be enjoyed--but it might have happened\nat a better time--and to have had longer notice of it, would have been\npleasanter.--They parted thorough friends, however; she could not\nbe deceived as to the meaning of his countenance, and his unfinished\ngallantry;--it was all done to assure her that she had fully recovered\nhis good opinion.--He had been sitting with them half an hour, she\nfound. It was a pity that she had not come back earlier!\n\nIn the hope of diverting her father's thoughts from the disagreeableness\nof Mr. Knightley's going to London; and going so suddenly; and going on\nhorseback, which she knew would be all very bad; Emma communicated her\nnews of Jane Fairfax, and her dependence on the effect was justified;\nit supplied a very useful check,--interested, without disturbing him. He\nhad long made up his mind to Jane Fairfax's going out as governess, and\ncould talk of it cheerfully, but Mr. Knightley's going to London had\nbeen an unexpected blow.\n\n“I am very glad, indeed, my dear, to hear she is to be so comfortably\nsettled. Mrs. Elton is very good-natured and agreeable, and I dare say\nher acquaintance are just what they ought to be. I hope it is a dry\nsituation, and that her health will be taken good care of. It ought to\nbe a first object, as I am sure poor Miss Taylor's always was with me.\nYou know, my dear, she is going to be to this new lady what Miss Taylor\nwas to us. And I hope she will be better off in one respect, and not be\ninduced to go away after it has been her home so long.”\n\nThe following day brought news from Richmond to throw every thing else\ninto the background. An express arrived at Randalls to announce the\ndeath of Mrs. Churchill! Though her nephew had had no particular reason\nto hasten back on her account, she had not lived above six-and-thirty\nhours after his return. A sudden seizure of a different nature from any\nthing foreboded by her general state, had carried her off after a short\nstruggle. The great Mrs. Churchill was no more.\n\nIt was felt as such things must be felt. Every body had a degree of\ngravity and sorrow; tenderness towards the departed, solicitude for the\nsurviving friends; and, in a reasonable time, curiosity to know where\nshe would be buried. Goldsmith tells us, that when lovely woman stoops\nto folly, she has nothing to do but to die; and when she stoops to be\ndisagreeable, it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of ill-fame.\nMrs. Churchill, after being disliked at least twenty-five years, was\nnow spoken of with compassionate allowances. In one point she was fully\njustified. She had never been admitted before to be seriously ill. The\nevent acquitted her of all the fancifulness, and all the selfishness of\nimaginary complaints.\n\n“Poor Mrs. Churchill! no doubt she had been suffering a great deal:\nmore than any body had ever supposed--and continual pain would try the\ntemper. It was a sad event--a great shock--with all her faults, what\nwould Mr. Churchill do without her? Mr. Churchill's loss would be\ndreadful indeed. Mr. Churchill would never get over it.”--Even Mr.\nWeston shook his head, and looked solemn, and said, “Ah! poor woman,\nwho would have thought it!” and resolved, that his mourning should be as\nhandsome as possible; and his wife sat sighing and moralising over her\nbroad hems with a commiseration and good sense, true and steady. How it\nwould affect Frank was among the earliest thoughts of both. It was also\na very early speculation with Emma. The character of Mrs. Churchill,\nthe grief of her husband--her mind glanced over them both with awe and\ncompassion--and then rested with lightened feelings on how Frank might\nbe affected by the event, how benefited, how freed. She saw in a moment\nall the possible good. Now, an attachment to Harriet Smith would have\nnothing to encounter. Mr. Churchill, independent of his wife, was feared\nby nobody; an easy, guidable man, to be persuaded into any thing by his\nnephew. All that remained to be wished was, that the nephew should form\nthe attachment, as, with all her goodwill in the cause, Emma could feel\nno certainty of its being already formed.\n\nHarriet behaved extremely well on the occasion, with great self-command.\nWhat ever she might feel of brighter hope, she betrayed nothing. Emma\nwas gratified, to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character,\nand refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance.\nThey spoke, therefore, of Mrs. Churchill's death with mutual\nforbearance.\n\nShort letters from Frank were received at Randalls, communicating all\nthat was immediately important of their state and plans. Mr. Churchill\nwas better than could be expected; and their first removal, on the\ndeparture of the funeral for Yorkshire, was to be to the house of a very\nold friend in Windsor, to whom Mr. Churchill had been promising a\nvisit the last ten years. At present, there was nothing to be done for\nHarriet; good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible\non Emma's side.\n\nIt was a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane Fairfax, whose\nprospects were closing, while Harriet's opened, and whose engagements\nnow allowed of no delay in any one at Highbury, who wished to shew her\nkindness--and with Emma it was grown into a first wish. She had scarcely\na stronger regret than for her past coldness; and the person, whom she\nhad been so many months neglecting, was now the very one on whom she\nwould have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy. She wanted\nto be of use to her; wanted to shew a value for her society, and testify\nrespect and consideration. She resolved to prevail on her to spend a day\nat Hartfield. A note was written to urge it. The invitation was refused,\nand by a verbal message. “Miss Fairfax was not well enough to write;”\n and when Mr. Perry called at Hartfield, the same morning, it appeared\nthat she was so much indisposed as to have been visited, though against\nher own consent, by himself, and that she was suffering under severe\nheadaches, and a nervous fever to a degree, which made him doubt the\npossibility of her going to Mrs. Smallridge's at the time proposed.\nHer health seemed for the moment completely deranged--appetite quite\ngone--and though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms, nothing\ntouching the pulmonary complaint, which was the standing apprehension\nof the family, Mr. Perry was uneasy about her. He thought she had\nundertaken more than she was equal to, and that she felt it so herself,\nthough she would not own it. Her spirits seemed overcome. Her\npresent home, he could not but observe, was unfavourable to a nervous\ndisorder:--confined always to one room;--he could have wished it\notherwise--and her good aunt, though his very old friend, he must\nacknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of that\ndescription. Her care and attention could not be questioned; they were,\nin fact, only too great. He very much feared that Miss Fairfax derived\nmore evil than good from them. Emma listened with the warmest concern;\ngrieved for her more and more, and looked around eager to discover some\nway of being useful. To take her--be it only an hour or two--from\nher aunt, to give her change of air and scene, and quiet rational\nconversation, even for an hour or two, might do her good; and the\nfollowing morning she wrote again to say, in the most feeling language\nshe could command, that she would call for her in the carriage at any\nhour that Jane would name--mentioning that she had Mr. Perry's decided\nopinion, in favour of such exercise for his patient. The answer was only\nin this short note:\n\n“Miss Fairfax's compliments and thanks, but is quite unequal to any\nexercise.”\n\nEmma felt that her own note had deserved something better; but it was\nimpossible to quarrel with words, whose tremulous inequality shewed\nindisposition so plainly, and she thought only of how she might best\ncounteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted. In spite of the\nanswer, therefore, she ordered the carriage, and drove to Mrs. Bates's,\nin the hope that Jane would be induced to join her--but it would not\ndo;--Miss Bates came to the carriage door, all gratitude, and agreeing\nwith her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatest\nservice--and every thing that message could do was tried--but all in\nvain. Miss Bates was obliged to return without success; Jane was\nquite unpersuadable; the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her\nworse.--Emma wished she could have seen her, and tried her own powers;\nbut, almost before she could hint the wish, Miss Bates made it appear\nthat she had promised her niece on no account to let Miss Woodhouse in.\n“Indeed, the truth was, that poor dear Jane could not bear to see any\nbody--any body at all--Mrs. Elton, indeed, could not be denied--and\nMrs. Cole had made such a point--and Mrs. Perry had said so much--but,\nexcept them, Jane would really see nobody.”\n\nEmma did not want to be classed with the Mrs. Eltons, the Mrs. Perrys,\nand the Mrs. Coles, who would force themselves anywhere; neither could\nshe feel any right of preference herself--she submitted, therefore, and\nonly questioned Miss Bates farther as to her niece's appetite and diet,\nwhich she longed to be able to assist. On that subject poor Miss Bates\nwas very unhappy, and very communicative; Jane would hardly eat any\nthing:--Mr. Perry recommended nourishing food; but every thing\nthey could command (and never had any body such good neighbours) was\ndistasteful.\n\nEmma, on reaching home, called the housekeeper directly, to an\nexamination of her stores; and some arrowroot of very superior quality\nwas speedily despatched to Miss Bates with a most friendly note. In half\nan hour the arrowroot was returned, with a thousand thanks from Miss\nBates, but “dear Jane would not be satisfied without its being sent\nback; it was a thing she could not take--and, moreover, she insisted on\nher saying, that she was not at all in want of any thing.”\n\nWhen Emma afterwards heard that Jane Fairfax had been seen wandering\nabout the meadows, at some distance from Highbury, on the afternoon of\nthe very day on which she had, under the plea of being unequal to any\nexercise, so peremptorily refused to go out with her in the carriage,\nshe could have no doubt--putting every thing together--that Jane was\nresolved to receive no kindness from _her_. She was sorry, very sorry.\nHer heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable\nfrom this sort of irritation of spirits, inconsistency of action, and\ninequality of powers; and it mortified her that she was given so little\ncredit for proper feeling, or esteemed so little worthy as a friend: but\nshe had the consolation of knowing that her intentions were good, and of\nbeing able to say to herself, that could Mr. Knightley have been privy\nto all her attempts of assisting Jane Fairfax, could he even have seen\ninto her heart, he would not, on this occasion, have found any thing to\nreprove.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\nOne morning, about ten days after Mrs. Churchill's decease, Emma was\ncalled downstairs to Mr. Weston, who “could not stay five minutes,\nand wanted particularly to speak with her.”--He met her at the\nparlour-door, and hardly asking her how she did, in the natural key of\nhis voice, sunk it immediately, to say, unheard by her father,\n\n“Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning?--Do, if it be\npossible. Mrs. Weston wants to see you. She must see you.”\n\n“Is she unwell?”\n\n“No, no, not at all--only a little agitated. She would have ordered the\ncarriage, and come to you, but she must see you _alone_, and that you\nknow--(nodding towards her father)--Humph!--Can you come?”\n\n“Certainly. This moment, if you please. It is impossible to refuse what\nyou ask in such a way. But what can be the matter?--Is she really not\nill?”\n\n“Depend upon me--but ask no more questions. You will know it all in\ntime. The most unaccountable business! But hush, hush!”\n\nTo guess what all this meant, was impossible even for Emma. Something\nreally important seemed announced by his looks; but, as her friend was\nwell, she endeavoured not to be uneasy, and settling it with her father,\nthat she would take her walk now, she and Mr. Weston were soon out of\nthe house together and on their way at a quick pace for Randalls.\n\n“Now,”--said Emma, when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates,--“now\nMr. Weston, do let me know what has happened.”\n\n“No, no,”--he gravely replied.--“Don't ask me. I promised my wife to\nleave it all to her. She will break it to you better than I can. Do not\nbe impatient, Emma; it will all come out too soon.”\n\n“Break it to me,” cried Emma, standing still with terror.--“Good\nGod!--Mr. Weston, tell me at once.--Something has happened in Brunswick\nSquare. I know it has. Tell me, I charge you tell me this moment what it\nis.”\n\n“No, indeed you are mistaken.”--\n\n“Mr. Weston do not trifle with me.--Consider how many of my dearest\nfriends are now in Brunswick Square. Which of them is it?--I charge you\nby all that is sacred, not to attempt concealment.”\n\n“Upon my word, Emma.”--\n\n“Your word!--why not your honour!--why not say upon your honour, that\nit has nothing to do with any of them? Good Heavens!--What can be to be\n_broke_ to me, that does not relate to one of that family?”\n\n“Upon my honour,” said he very seriously, “it does not. It is not in\nthe smallest degree connected with any human being of the name of\nKnightley.”\n\nEmma's courage returned, and she walked on.\n\n“I was wrong,” he continued, “in talking of its being _broke_ to you.\nI should not have used the expression. In fact, it does not concern\nyou--it concerns only myself,--that is, we hope.--Humph!--In short, my\ndear Emma, there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it. I don't\nsay that it is not a disagreeable business--but things might be much\nworse.--If we walk fast, we shall soon be at Randalls.”\n\nEmma found that she must wait; and now it required little effort. She\nasked no more questions therefore, merely employed her own fancy, and\nthat soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some money\nconcern--something just come to light, of a disagreeable nature in the\ncircumstances of the family,--something which the late event at Richmond\nhad brought forward. Her fancy was very active. Half a dozen natural\nchildren, perhaps--and poor Frank cut off!--This, though very\nundesirable, would be no matter of agony to her. It inspired little more\nthan an animating curiosity.\n\n“Who is that gentleman on horseback?” said she, as they\nproceeded--speaking more to assist Mr. Weston in keeping his secret,\nthan with any other view.\n\n“I do not know.--One of the Otways.--Not Frank;--it is not Frank, I\nassure you. You will not see him. He is half way to Windsor by this\ntime.”\n\n“Has your son been with you, then?”\n\n“Oh! yes--did not you know?--Well, well, never mind.”\n\nFor a moment he was silent; and then added, in a tone much more guarded\nand demure,\n\n“Yes, Frank came over this morning, just to ask us how we did.”\n\nThey hurried on, and were speedily at Randalls.--“Well, my dear,” said\nhe, as they entered the room--“I have brought her, and now I hope you\nwill soon be better. I shall leave you together. There is no use in\ndelay. I shall not be far off, if you want me.”--And Emma distinctly\nheard him add, in a lower tone, before he quitted the room,--“I have\nbeen as good as my word. She has not the least idea.”\n\nMrs. Weston was looking so ill, and had an air of so much perturbation,\nthat Emma's uneasiness increased; and the moment they were alone, she\neagerly said,\n\n“What is it my dear friend? Something of a very unpleasant nature, I\nfind, has occurred;--do let me know directly what it is. I have been\nwalking all this way in complete suspense. We both abhor suspense.\nDo not let mine continue longer. It will do you good to speak of your\ndistress, whatever it may be.”\n\n“Have you indeed no idea?” said Mrs. Weston in a trembling voice.\n“Cannot you, my dear Emma--cannot you form a guess as to what you are to\nhear?”\n\n“So far as that it relates to Mr. Frank Churchill, I do guess.”\n\n“You are right. It does relate to him, and I will tell you directly;”\n (resuming her work, and seeming resolved against looking up.) “He has\nbeen here this very morning, on a most extraordinary errand. It is\nimpossible to express our surprize. He came to speak to his father on a\nsubject,--to announce an attachment--”\n\nShe stopped to breathe. Emma thought first of herself, and then of\nHarriet.\n\n“More than an attachment, indeed,” resumed Mrs. Weston; “an\nengagement--a positive engagement.--What will you say, Emma--what will\nany body say, when it is known that Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax are\nengaged;--nay, that they have been long engaged!”\n\nEmma even jumped with surprize;--and, horror-struck, exclaimed,\n\n“Jane Fairfax!--Good God! You are not serious? You do not mean it?”\n\n“You may well be amazed,” returned Mrs. Weston, still averting her eyes,\nand talking on with eagerness, that Emma might have time to recover--\n“You may well be amazed. But it is even so. There has been a solemn\nengagement between them ever since October--formed at Weymouth, and\nkept a secret from every body. Not a creature knowing it but\nthemselves--neither the Campbells, nor her family, nor his.--It is so\nwonderful, that though perfectly convinced of the fact, it is yet almost\nincredible to myself. I can hardly believe it.--I thought I knew him.”\n\nEmma scarcely heard what was said.--Her mind was divided between two\nideas--her own former conversations with him about Miss Fairfax; and\npoor Harriet;--and for some time she could only exclaim, and require\nconfirmation, repeated confirmation.\n\n“Well,” said she at last, trying to recover herself; “this is a\ncircumstance which I must think of at least half a day, before I can at\nall comprehend it. What!--engaged to her all the winter--before either\nof them came to Highbury?”\n\n“Engaged since October,--secretly engaged.--It has hurt me, Emma, very\nmuch. It has hurt his father equally. _Some_ _part_ of his conduct we\ncannot excuse.”\n\nEmma pondered a moment, and then replied, “I will not pretend _not_ to\nunderstand you; and to give you all the relief in my power, be assured\nthat no such effect has followed his attentions to me, as you are\napprehensive of.”\n\nMrs. Weston looked up, afraid to believe; but Emma's countenance was as\nsteady as her words.\n\n“That you may have less difficulty in believing this boast, of my\npresent perfect indifference,” she continued, “I will farther tell you,\nthat there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance, when I\ndid like him, when I was very much disposed to be attached to him--nay,\nwas attached--and how it came to cease, is perhaps the wonder.\nFortunately, however, it did cease. I have really for some time past,\nfor at least these three months, cared nothing about him. You may\nbelieve me, Mrs. Weston. This is the simple truth.”\n\nMrs. Weston kissed her with tears of joy; and when she could find\nutterance, assured her, that this protestation had done her more good\nthan any thing else in the world could do.\n\n“Mr. Weston will be almost as much relieved as myself,” said she. “On\nthis point we have been wretched. It was our darling wish that you\nmight be attached to each other--and we were persuaded that it was so.--\nImagine what we have been feeling on your account.”\n\n“I have escaped; and that I should escape, may be a matter of grateful\nwonder to you and myself. But this does not acquit _him_, Mrs. Weston;\nand I must say, that I think him greatly to blame. What right had he\nto come among us with affection and faith engaged, and with manners\nso _very_ disengaged? What right had he to endeavour to please, as\nhe certainly did--to distinguish any one young woman with persevering\nattention, as he certainly did--while he really belonged to\nanother?--How could he tell what mischief he might be doing?--How could\nhe tell that he might not be making me in love with him?--very wrong,\nvery wrong indeed.”\n\n“From something that he said, my dear Emma, I rather imagine--”\n\n“And how could _she_ bear such behaviour! Composure with a witness!\nto look on, while repeated attentions were offering to another woman,\nbefore her face, and not resent it.--That is a degree of placidity,\nwhich I can neither comprehend nor respect.”\n\n“There were misunderstandings between them, Emma; he said so expressly.\nHe had not time to enter into much explanation. He was here only a\nquarter of an hour, and in a state of agitation which did not allow\nthe full use even of the time he could stay--but that there had been\nmisunderstandings he decidedly said. The present crisis, indeed,\nseemed to be brought on by them; and those misunderstandings might very\npossibly arise from the impropriety of his conduct.”\n\n“Impropriety! Oh! Mrs. Weston--it is too calm a censure. Much, much\nbeyond impropriety!--It has sunk him, I cannot say how it has sunk him\nin my opinion. So unlike what a man should be!--None of that upright\nintegrity, that strict adherence to truth and principle, that disdain of\ntrick and littleness, which a man should display in every transaction of\nhis life.”\n\n“Nay, dear Emma, now I must take his part; for though he has been wrong\nin this instance, I have known him long enough to answer for his having\nmany, very many, good qualities; and--”\n\n“Good God!” cried Emma, not attending to her.--“Mrs. Smallridge, too!\nJane actually on the point of going as governess! What could he mean by\nsuch horrible indelicacy? To suffer her to engage herself--to suffer her\neven to think of such a measure!”\n\n“He knew nothing about it, Emma. On this article I can fully acquit\nhim. It was a private resolution of hers, not communicated to him--or at\nleast not communicated in a way to carry conviction.--Till yesterday, I\nknow he said he was in the dark as to her plans. They burst on him, I do\nnot know how, but by some letter or message--and it was the discovery of\nwhat she was doing, of this very project of hers, which determined him\nto come forward at once, own it all to his uncle, throw himself on\nhis kindness, and, in short, put an end to the miserable state of\nconcealment that had been carrying on so long.”\n\nEmma began to listen better.\n\n“I am to hear from him soon,” continued Mrs. Weston. “He told me at\nparting, that he should soon write; and he spoke in a manner which\nseemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now. Let\nus wait, therefore, for this letter. It may bring many extenuations. It\nmay make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to\nbe understood. Don't let us be severe, don't let us be in a hurry to\ncondemn him. Let us have patience. I must love him; and now that I am\nsatisfied on one point, the one material point, I am sincerely anxious\nfor its all turning out well, and ready to hope that it may. They must\nboth have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy and\nconcealment.”\n\n“_His_ sufferings,” replied Emma dryly, “do not appear to have done him\nmuch harm. Well, and how did Mr. Churchill take it?”\n\n“Most favourably for his nephew--gave his consent with scarcely a\ndifficulty. Conceive what the events of a week have done in that family!\nWhile poor Mrs. Churchill lived, I suppose there could not have been a\nhope, a chance, a possibility;--but scarcely are her remains at rest in\nthe family vault, than her husband is persuaded to act exactly opposite\nto what she would have required. What a blessing it is, when undue\ninfluence does not survive the grave!--He gave his consent with very\nlittle persuasion.”\n\n“Ah!” thought Emma, “he would have done as much for Harriet.”\n\n“This was settled last night, and Frank was off with the light this\nmorning. He stopped at Highbury, at the Bates's, I fancy, some time--and\nthen came on hither; but was in such a hurry to get back to his uncle,\nto whom he is just now more necessary than ever, that, as I tell you,\nhe could stay with us but a quarter of an hour.--He was very much\nagitated--very much, indeed--to a degree that made him appear quite\na different creature from any thing I had ever seen him before.--In\naddition to all the rest, there had been the shock of finding her so\nvery unwell, which he had had no previous suspicion of--and there was\nevery appearance of his having been feeling a great deal.”\n\n“And do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on with such\nperfect secresy?--The Campbells, the Dixons, did none of them know of\nthe engagement?”\n\nEmma could not speak the name of Dixon without a little blush.\n\n“None; not one. He positively said that it had been known to no being in\nthe world but their two selves.”\n\n“Well,” said Emma, “I suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled to the\nidea, and I wish them very happy. But I shall always think it a\nvery abominable sort of proceeding. What has it been but a system of\nhypocrisy and deceit,--espionage, and treachery?--To come among us with\nprofessions of openness and simplicity; and such a league in secret\nto judge us all!--Here have we been, the whole winter and spring,\ncompletely duped, fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth\nand honour, with two people in the midst of us who may have been\ncarrying round, comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and\nwords that were never meant for both to hear.--They must take the\nconsequence, if they have heard each other spoken of in a way not\nperfectly agreeable!”\n\n“I am quite easy on that head,” replied Mrs. Weston. “I am very sure\nthat I never said any thing of either to the other, which both might not\nhave heard.”\n\n“You are in luck.--Your only blunder was confined to my ear, when you\nimagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady.”\n\n“True. But as I have always had a thoroughly good opinion of Miss\nFairfax, I never could, under any blunder, have spoken ill of her; and\nas to speaking ill of him, there I must have been safe.”\n\nAt this moment Mr. Weston appeared at a little distance from the window,\nevidently on the watch. His wife gave him a look which invited him\nin; and, while he was coming round, added, “Now, dearest Emma, let me\nintreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at ease,\nand incline him to be satisfied with the match. Let us make the best of\nit--and, indeed, almost every thing may be fairly said in her favour. It\nis not a connexion to gratify; but if Mr. Churchill does not feel that,\nwhy should we? and it may be a very fortunate circumstance for him, for\nFrank, I mean, that he should have attached himself to a girl of such\nsteadiness of character and good judgment as I have always given her\ncredit for--and still am disposed to give her credit for, in spite of\nthis one great deviation from the strict rule of right. And how much may\nbe said in her situation for even that error!”\n\n“Much, indeed!” cried Emma feelingly. “If a woman can ever be\nexcused for thinking only of herself, it is in a situation like Jane\nFairfax's.--Of such, one may almost say, that 'the world is not their's,\nnor the world's law.'”\n\nShe met Mr. Weston on his entrance, with a smiling countenance,\nexclaiming,\n\n“A very pretty trick you have been playing me, upon my word! This was a\ndevice, I suppose, to sport with my curiosity, and exercise my talent of\nguessing. But you really frightened me. I thought you had lost half\nyour property, at least. And here, instead of its being a matter of\ncondolence, it turns out to be one of congratulation.--I congratulate\nyou, Mr. Weston, with all my heart, on the prospect of having one of the\nmost lovely and accomplished young women in England for your daughter.”\n\nA glance or two between him and his wife, convinced him that all was as\nright as this speech proclaimed; and its happy effect on his spirits was\nimmediate. His air and voice recovered their usual briskness: he shook\nher heartily and gratefully by the hand, and entered on the subject in\na manner to prove, that he now only wanted time and persuasion to think\nthe engagement no very bad thing. His companions suggested only what\ncould palliate imprudence, or smooth objections; and by the time they\nhad talked it all over together, and he had talked it all over again\nwith Emma, in their walk back to Hartfield, he was become perfectly\nreconciled, and not far from thinking it the very best thing that Frank\ncould possibly have done.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\n“Harriet, poor Harriet!”--Those were the words; in them lay the\ntormenting ideas which Emma could not get rid of, and which constituted\nthe real misery of the business to her. Frank Churchill had behaved very\nill by herself--very ill in many ways,--but it was not so much _his_\nbehaviour as her _own_, which made her so angry with him. It was the\nscrape which he had drawn her into on Harriet's account, that gave the\ndeepest hue to his offence.--Poor Harriet! to be a second time the\ndupe of her misconceptions and flattery. Mr. Knightley had spoken\nprophetically, when he once said, “Emma, you have been no friend\nto Harriet Smith.”--She was afraid she had done her nothing but\ndisservice.--It was true that she had not to charge herself, in this\ninstance as in the former, with being the sole and original author of\nthe mischief; with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise\nnever have entered Harriet's imagination; for Harriet had acknowledged\nher admiration and preference of Frank Churchill before she had ever\ngiven her a hint on the subject; but she felt completely guilty\nof having encouraged what she might have repressed. She might have\nprevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments. Her influence\nwould have been enough. And now she was very conscious that she ought\nto have prevented them.--She felt that she had been risking her friend's\nhappiness on most insufficient grounds. Common sense would have directed\nher to tell Harriet, that she must not allow herself to think of him,\nand that there were five hundred chances to one against his ever caring\nfor her.--“But, with common sense,” she added, “I am afraid I have had\nlittle to do.”\n\nShe was extremely angry with herself. If she could not have been angry\nwith Frank Churchill too, it would have been dreadful.--As for Jane\nFairfax, she might at least relieve her feelings from any present\nsolicitude on her account. Harriet would be anxiety enough; she need\nno longer be unhappy about Jane, whose troubles and whose ill-health\nhaving, of course, the same origin, must be equally under cure.--Her\ndays of insignificance and evil were over.--She would soon be well, and\nhappy, and prosperous.--Emma could now imagine why her own attentions\nhad been slighted. This discovery laid many smaller matters open. No\ndoubt it had been from jealousy.--In Jane's eyes she had been a rival;\nand well might any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be\nrepulsed. An airing in the Hartfield carriage would have been the rack,\nand arrowroot from the Hartfield storeroom must have been poison. She\nunderstood it all; and as far as her mind could disengage itself from\nthe injustice and selfishness of angry feelings, she acknowledged that\nJane Fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond her\ndesert. But poor Harriet was such an engrossing charge! There was little\nsympathy to be spared for any body else. Emma was sadly fearful\nthat this second disappointment would be more severe than the first.\nConsidering the very superior claims of the object, it ought; and\njudging by its apparently stronger effect on Harriet's mind, producing\nreserve and self-command, it would.--She must communicate the painful\ntruth, however, and as soon as possible. An injunction of secresy had\nbeen among Mr. Weston's parting words. “For the present, the whole\naffair was to be completely a secret. Mr. Churchill had made a point of\nit, as a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost;\nand every body admitted it to be no more than due decorum.”--Emma had\npromised; but still Harriet must be excepted. It was her superior duty.\n\nIn spite of her vexation, she could not help feeling it almost\nridiculous, that she should have the very same distressing and delicate\noffice to perform by Harriet, which Mrs. Weston had just gone through by\nherself. The intelligence, which had been so anxiously announced to her,\nshe was now to be anxiously announcing to another. Her heart beat quick\non hearing Harriet's footstep and voice; so, she supposed, had poor Mrs.\nWeston felt when _she_ was approaching Randalls. Could the event of\nthe disclosure bear an equal resemblance!--But of that, unfortunately,\nthere could be no chance.\n\n“Well, Miss Woodhouse!” cried Harriet, coming eagerly into the room--“is\nnot this the oddest news that ever was?”\n\n“What news do you mean?” replied Emma, unable to guess, by look or\nvoice, whether Harriet could indeed have received any hint.\n\n“About Jane Fairfax. Did you ever hear any thing so strange? Oh!--you\nneed not be afraid of owning it to me, for Mr. Weston has told me\nhimself. I met him just now. He told me it was to be a great secret;\nand, therefore, I should not think of mentioning it to any body but you,\nbut he said you knew it.”\n\n“What did Mr. Weston tell you?”--said Emma, still perplexed.\n\n“Oh! he told me all about it; that Jane Fairfax and Mr. Frank Churchill\nare to be married, and that they have been privately engaged to one\nanother this long while. How very odd!”\n\nIt was, indeed, so odd; Harriet's behaviour was so extremely odd,\nthat Emma did not know how to understand it. Her character appeared\nabsolutely changed. She seemed to propose shewing no agitation, or\ndisappointment, or peculiar concern in the discovery. Emma looked at\nher, quite unable to speak.\n\n“Had you any idea,” cried Harriet, “of his being in love with her?--You,\nperhaps, might.--You (blushing as she spoke) who can see into every\nbody's heart; but nobody else--”\n\n“Upon my word,” said Emma, “I begin to doubt my having any such talent.\nCan you seriously ask me, Harriet, whether I imagined him attached\nto another woman at the very time that I was--tacitly, if not\nopenly--encouraging you to give way to your own feelings?--I never\nhad the slightest suspicion, till within the last hour, of Mr. Frank\nChurchill's having the least regard for Jane Fairfax. You may be very\nsure that if I had, I should have cautioned you accordingly.”\n\n“Me!” cried Harriet, colouring, and astonished. “Why should you caution\nme?--You do not think I care about Mr. Frank Churchill.”\n\n“I am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject,” replied\nEmma, smiling; “but you do not mean to deny that there was a time--and\nnot very distant either--when you gave me reason to understand that you\ndid care about him?”\n\n“Him!--never, never. Dear Miss Woodhouse, how could you so mistake me?”\n turning away distressed.\n\n“Harriet!” cried Emma, after a moment's pause--“What do you mean?--Good\nHeaven! what do you mean?--Mistake you!--Am I to suppose then?--”\n\nShe could not speak another word.--Her voice was lost; and she sat down,\nwaiting in great terror till Harriet should answer.\n\nHarriet, who was standing at some distance, and with face turned from\nher, did not immediately say any thing; and when she did speak, it was\nin a voice nearly as agitated as Emma's.\n\n“I should not have thought it possible,” she began, “that you could have\nmisunderstood me! I know we agreed never to name him--but considering\nhow infinitely superior he is to every body else, I should not have\nthought it possible that I could be supposed to mean any other person.\nMr. Frank Churchill, indeed! I do not know who would ever look at him in\nthe company of the other. I hope I have a better taste than to think of\nMr. Frank Churchill, who is like nobody by his side. And that you should\nhave been so mistaken, is amazing!--I am sure, but for believing that\nyou entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment, I\nshould have considered it at first too great a presumption almost,\nto dare to think of him. At first, if you had not told me that more\nwonderful things had happened; that there had been matches of greater\ndisparity (those were your very words);--I should not have dared to\ngive way to--I should not have thought it possible--But if _you_, who\nhad been always acquainted with him--”\n\n“Harriet!” cried Emma, collecting herself resolutely--“Let us understand\neach other now, without the possibility of farther mistake. Are you\nspeaking of--Mr. Knightley?”\n\n“To be sure I am. I never could have an idea of any body else--and so\nI thought you knew. When we talked about him, it was as clear as\npossible.”\n\n“Not quite,” returned Emma, with forced calmness, “for all that you then\nsaid, appeared to me to relate to a different person. I could almost\nassert that you had _named_ Mr. Frank Churchill. I am sure the service\nMr. Frank Churchill had rendered you, in protecting you from the\ngipsies, was spoken of.”\n\n“Oh! Miss Woodhouse, how you do forget!”\n\n“My dear Harriet, I perfectly remember the substance of what I said on\nthe occasion. I told you that I did not wonder at your attachment;\nthat considering the service he had rendered you, it was extremely\nnatural:--and you agreed to it, expressing yourself very warmly as to\nyour sense of that service, and mentioning even what your sensations had\nbeen in seeing him come forward to your rescue.--The impression of it is\nstrong on my memory.”\n\n“Oh, dear,” cried Harriet, “now I recollect what you mean; but I\nwas thinking of something very different at the time. It was not the\ngipsies--it was not Mr. Frank Churchill that I meant. No! (with some\nelevation) I was thinking of a much more precious circumstance--of Mr.\nKnightley's coming and asking me to dance, when Mr. Elton would not\nstand up with me; and when there was no other partner in the room. That\nwas the kind action; that was the noble benevolence and generosity; that\nwas the service which made me begin to feel how superior he was to every\nother being upon earth.”\n\n“Good God!” cried Emma, “this has been a most unfortunate--most\ndeplorable mistake!--What is to be done?”\n\n“You would not have encouraged me, then, if you had understood me? At\nleast, however, I cannot be worse off than I should have been, if the\nother had been the person; and now--it _is_ possible--”\n\nShe paused a few moments. Emma could not speak.\n\n“I do not wonder, Miss Woodhouse,” she resumed, “that you should feel a\ngreat difference between the two, as to me or as to any body. You must\nthink one five hundred million times more above me than the other. But\nI hope, Miss Woodhouse, that supposing--that if--strange as it may\nappear--. But you know they were your own words, that _more_ wonderful\nthings had happened, matches of _greater_ disparity had taken place than\nbetween Mr. Frank Churchill and me; and, therefore, it seems as if such\na thing even as this, may have occurred before--and if I should be so\nfortunate, beyond expression, as to--if Mr. Knightley should really--if\n_he_ does not mind the disparity, I hope, dear Miss Woodhouse, you will\nnot set yourself against it, and try to put difficulties in the way. But\nyou are too good for that, I am sure.”\n\nHarriet was standing at one of the windows. Emma turned round to look at\nher in consternation, and hastily said,\n\n“Have you any idea of Mr. Knightley's returning your affection?”\n\n“Yes,” replied Harriet modestly, but not fearfully--“I must say that I\nhave.”\n\nEmma's eyes were instantly withdrawn; and she sat silently meditating,\nin a fixed attitude, for a few minutes. A few minutes were sufficient\nfor making her acquainted with her own heart. A mind like hers,\nonce opening to suspicion, made rapid progress. She touched--she\nadmitted--she acknowledged the whole truth. Why was it so much worse\nthat Harriet should be in love with Mr. Knightley, than with Frank\nChurchill? Why was the evil so dreadfully increased by Harriet's having\nsome hope of a return? It darted through her, with the speed of an\narrow, that Mr. Knightley must marry no one but herself!\n\nHer own conduct, as well as her own heart, was before her in the same\nfew minutes. She saw it all with a clearness which had never blessed\nher before. How improperly had she been acting by Harriet! How\ninconsiderate, how indelicate, how irrational, how unfeeling had been\nher conduct! What blindness, what madness, had led her on! It struck her\nwith dreadful force, and she was ready to give it every bad name in the\nworld. Some portion of respect for herself, however, in spite of all\nthese demerits--some concern for her own appearance, and a strong sense\nof justice by Harriet--(there would be no need of _compassion_ to the\ngirl who believed herself loved by Mr. Knightley--but justice required\nthat she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now,) gave Emma the\nresolution to sit and endure farther with calmness, with even apparent\nkindness.--For her own advantage indeed, it was fit that the utmost\nextent of Harriet's hopes should be enquired into; and Harriet had done\nnothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily\nformed and maintained--or to deserve to be slighted by the person, whose\ncounsels had never led her right.--Rousing from reflection, therefore,\nand subduing her emotion, she turned to Harriet again, and, in a more\ninviting accent, renewed the conversation; for as to the subject which\nhad first introduced it, the wonderful story of Jane Fairfax, that was\nquite sunk and lost.--Neither of them thought but of Mr. Knightley and\nthemselves.\n\nHarriet, who had been standing in no unhappy reverie, was yet very glad\nto be called from it, by the now encouraging manner of such a judge, and\nsuch a friend as Miss Woodhouse, and only wanted invitation, to give\nthe history of her hopes with great, though trembling delight.--Emma's\ntremblings as she asked, and as she listened, were better concealed than\nHarriet's, but they were not less. Her voice was not unsteady; but her\nmind was in all the perturbation that such a development of self, such\na burst of threatening evil, such a confusion of sudden and perplexing\nemotions, must create.--She listened with much inward suffering, but\nwith great outward patience, to Harriet's detail.--Methodical, or well\narranged, or very well delivered, it could not be expected to be; but it\ncontained, when separated from all the feebleness and tautology of\nthe narration, a substance to sink her spirit--especially with the\ncorroborating circumstances, which her own memory brought in favour of\nMr. Knightley's most improved opinion of Harriet.\n\nHarriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since\nthose two decisive dances.--Emma knew that he had, on that occasion,\nfound her much superior to his expectation. From that evening, or at\nleast from the time of Miss Woodhouse's encouraging her to think of him,\nHarriet had begun to be sensible of his talking to her much more than he\nhad been used to do, and of his having indeed quite a different manner\ntowards her; a manner of kindness and sweetness!--Latterly she had been\nmore and more aware of it. When they had been all walking together,\nhe had so often come and walked by her, and talked so very\ndelightfully!--He seemed to want to be acquainted with her. Emma knew it\nto have been very much the case. She had often observed the change, to\nalmost the same extent.--Harriet repeated expressions of approbation\nand praise from him--and Emma felt them to be in the closest agreement\nwith what she had known of his opinion of Harriet. He praised her for\nbeing without art or affectation, for having simple, honest, generous,\nfeelings.--She knew that he saw such recommendations in Harriet; he\nhad dwelt on them to her more than once.--Much that lived in Harriet's\nmemory, many little particulars of the notice she had received from\nhim, a look, a speech, a removal from one chair to another, a compliment\nimplied, a preference inferred, had been unnoticed, because unsuspected,\nby Emma. Circumstances that might swell to half an hour's relation,\nand contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them, had passed\nundiscerned by her who now heard them; but the two latest occurrences to\nbe mentioned, the two of strongest promise to Harriet, were not without\nsome degree of witness from Emma herself.--The first, was his walking\nwith her apart from the others, in the lime-walk at Donwell, where they\nhad been walking some time before Emma came, and he had taken pains (as\nshe was convinced) to draw her from the rest to himself--and at first,\nhe had talked to her in a more particular way than he had ever done\nbefore, in a very particular way indeed!--(Harriet could not recall\nit without a blush.) He seemed to be almost asking her, whether her\naffections were engaged.--But as soon as she (Miss Woodhouse) appeared\nlikely to join them, he changed the subject, and began talking about\nfarming:--The second, was his having sat talking with her nearly half\nan hour before Emma came back from her visit, the very last morning of\nhis being at Hartfield--though, when he first came in, he had said that\nhe could not stay five minutes--and his having told her, during their\nconversation, that though he must go to London, it was very much against\nhis inclination that he left home at all, which was much more (as\nEmma felt) than he had acknowledged to _her_. The superior degree of\nconfidence towards Harriet, which this one article marked, gave her\nsevere pain.\n\nOn the subject of the first of the two circumstances, she did, after a\nlittle reflection, venture the following question. “Might he not?--Is\nnot it possible, that when enquiring, as you thought, into the state of\nyour affections, he might be alluding to Mr. Martin--he might have\nMr. Martin's interest in view? But Harriet rejected the suspicion with\nspirit.\n\n“Mr. Martin! No indeed!--There was not a hint of Mr. Martin. I hope I\nknow better now, than to care for Mr. Martin, or to be suspected of it.”\n\nWhen Harriet had closed her evidence, she appealed to her dear Miss\nWoodhouse, to say whether she had not good ground for hope.\n\n“I never should have presumed to think of it at first,” said she, “but\nfor you. You told me to observe him carefully, and let his behaviour\nbe the rule of mine--and so I have. But now I seem to feel that I may\ndeserve him; and that if he does chuse me, it will not be any thing so\nvery wonderful.”\n\nThe bitter feelings occasioned by this speech, the many bitter feelings,\nmade the utmost exertion necessary on Emma's side, to enable her to say\non reply,\n\n“Harriet, I will only venture to declare, that Mr. Knightley is the last\nman in the world, who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his\nfeeling for her more than he really does.”\n\nHarriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so\nsatisfactory; and Emma was only saved from raptures and fondness, which\nat that moment would have been dreadful penance, by the sound of her\nfather's footsteps. He was coming through the hall. Harriet was too\nmuch agitated to encounter him. “She could not compose herself--\nMr. Woodhouse would be alarmed--she had better go;”--with most ready\nencouragement from her friend, therefore, she passed off through another\ndoor--and the moment she was gone, this was the spontaneous burst of\nEmma's feelings: “Oh God! that I had never seen her!”\n\nThe rest of the day, the following night, were hardly enough for her\nthoughts.--She was bewildered amidst the confusion of all that had\nrushed on her within the last few hours. Every moment had brought a\nfresh surprize; and every surprize must be matter of humiliation to\nher.--How to understand it all! How to understand the deceptions she had\nbeen thus practising on herself, and living under!--The blunders, the\nblindness of her own head and heart!--she sat still, she walked about,\nshe tried her own room, she tried the shrubbery--in every place, every\nposture, she perceived that she had acted most weakly; that she had\nbeen imposed on by others in a most mortifying degree; that she had\nbeen imposing on herself in a degree yet more mortifying; that she\nwas wretched, and should probably find this day but the beginning of\nwretchedness.\n\nTo understand, thoroughly understand her own heart, was the first\nendeavour. To that point went every leisure moment which her father's\nclaims on her allowed, and every moment of involuntary absence of mind.\n\nHow long had Mr. Knightley been so dear to her, as every feeling\ndeclared him now to be? When had his influence, such influence begun?--\nWhen had he succeeded to that place in her affection, which Frank\nChurchill had once, for a short period, occupied?--She looked back;\nshe compared the two--compared them, as they had always stood in her\nestimation, from the time of the latter's becoming known to her--and as\nthey must at any time have been compared by her, had it--oh! had it, by\nany blessed felicity, occurred to her, to institute the comparison.--She\nsaw that there never had been a time when she did not consider Mr.\nKnightley as infinitely the superior, or when his regard for her had not\nbeen infinitely the most dear. She saw, that in persuading herself,\nin fancying, in acting to the contrary, she had been entirely under a\ndelusion, totally ignorant of her own heart--and, in short, that she had\nnever really cared for Frank Churchill at all!\n\nThis was the conclusion of the first series of reflection. This was\nthe knowledge of herself, on the first question of inquiry, which\nshe reached; and without being long in reaching it.--She was most\nsorrowfully indignant; ashamed of every sensation but the one revealed\nto her--her affection for Mr. Knightley.--Every other part of her mind\nwas disgusting.\n\nWith insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every\nbody's feelings; with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every\nbody's destiny. She was proved to have been universally mistaken; and\nshe had not quite done nothing--for she had done mischief. She had\nbrought evil on Harriet, on herself, and she too much feared, on Mr.\nKnightley.--Were this most unequal of all connexions to take place, on\nher must rest all the reproach of having given it a beginning; for his\nattachment, she must believe to be produced only by a consciousness of\nHarriet's;--and even were this not the case, he would never have known\nHarriet at all but for her folly.\n\nMr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!--It was a union to distance every\nwonder of the kind.--The attachment of Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax\nbecame commonplace, threadbare, stale in the comparison, exciting no\nsurprize, presenting no disparity, affording nothing to be said or\nthought.--Mr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!--Such an elevation on her\nside! Such a debasement on his! It was horrible to Emma to think how it\nmust sink him in the general opinion, to foresee the smiles, the sneers,\nthe merriment it would prompt at his expense; the mortification and\ndisdain of his brother, the thousand inconveniences to himself.--Could\nit be?--No; it was impossible. And yet it was far, very far, from\nimpossible.--Was it a new circumstance for a man of first-rate abilities\nto be captivated by very inferior powers? Was it new for one, perhaps\ntoo busy to seek, to be the prize of a girl who would seek him?--Was\nit new for any thing in this world to be unequal, inconsistent,\nincongruous--or for chance and circumstance (as second causes) to direct\nthe human fate?\n\nOh! had she never brought Harriet forward! Had she left her where she\nought, and where he had told her she ought!--Had she not, with a\nfolly which no tongue could express, prevented her marrying the\nunexceptionable young man who would have made her happy and respectable\nin the line of life to which she ought to belong--all would have been\nsafe; none of this dreadful sequel would have been.\n\nHow Harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise her thoughts to\nMr. Knightley!--How she could dare to fancy herself the chosen of such\na man till actually assured of it!--But Harriet was less humble, had\nfewer scruples than formerly.--Her inferiority, whether of mind or\nsituation, seemed little felt.--She had seemed more sensible of Mr.\nElton's being to stoop in marrying her, than she now seemed of Mr.\nKnightley's.--Alas! was not that her own doing too? Who had been at\npains to give Harriet notions of self-consequence but herself?--Who but\nherself had taught her, that she was to elevate herself if possible,\nand that her claims were great to a high worldly establishment?--If\nHarriet, from being humble, were grown vain, it was her doing too.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\nTill now that she was threatened with its loss, Emma had never known\nhow much of her happiness depended on being _first_ with Mr. Knightley,\nfirst in interest and affection.--Satisfied that it was so, and feeling\nit her due, she had enjoyed it without reflection; and only in the\ndread of being supplanted, found how inexpressibly important it had\nbeen.--Long, very long, she felt she had been first; for, having no\nfemale connexions of his own, there had been only Isabella whose claims\ncould be compared with hers, and she had always known exactly how far\nhe loved and esteemed Isabella. She had herself been first with him for\nmany years past. She had not deserved it; she had often been negligent\nor perverse, slighting his advice, or even wilfully opposing him,\ninsensible of half his merits, and quarrelling with him because he would\nnot acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own--but still,\nfrom family attachment and habit, and thorough excellence of mind, he\nhad loved her, and watched over her from a girl, with an endeavour to\nimprove her, and an anxiety for her doing right, which no other creature\nhad at all shared. In spite of all her faults, she knew she was dear\nto him; might she not say, very dear?--When the suggestions of hope,\nhowever, which must follow here, presented themselves, she could not\npresume to indulge them. Harriet Smith might think herself not unworthy\nof being peculiarly, exclusively, passionately loved by Mr. Knightley.\n_She_ could not. She could not flatter herself with any idea of\nblindness in his attachment to _her_. She had received a very recent\nproof of its impartiality.--How shocked had he been by her behaviour to\nMiss Bates! How directly, how strongly had he expressed himself to her\non the subject!--Not too strongly for the offence--but far, far too\nstrongly to issue from any feeling softer than upright justice and\nclear-sighted goodwill.--She had no hope, nothing to deserve the name\nof hope, that he could have that sort of affection for herself which was\nnow in question; but there was a hope (at times a slight one, at\ntimes much stronger,) that Harriet might have deceived herself, and be\noverrating his regard for _her_.--Wish it she must, for his sake--be the\nconsequence nothing to herself, but his remaining single all his life.\nCould she be secure of that, indeed, of his never marrying at all, she\nbelieved she should be perfectly satisfied.--Let him but continue the\nsame Mr. Knightley to her and her father, the same Mr. Knightley to\nall the world; let Donwell and Hartfield lose none of their precious\nintercourse of friendship and confidence, and her peace would be\nfully secured.--Marriage, in fact, would not do for her. It would be\nincompatible with what she owed to her father, and with what she felt\nfor him. Nothing should separate her from her father. She would not\nmarry, even if she were asked by Mr. Knightley.\n\nIt must be her ardent wish that Harriet might be disappointed; and she\nhoped, that when able to see them together again, she might at least\nbe able to ascertain what the chances for it were.--She should see them\nhenceforward with the closest observance; and wretchedly as she had\nhitherto misunderstood even those she was watching, she did not know how\nto admit that she could be blinded here.--He was expected back every\nday. The power of observation would be soon given--frightfully soon it\nappeared when her thoughts were in one course. In the meanwhile, she\nresolved against seeing Harriet.--It would do neither of them good,\nit would do the subject no good, to be talking of it farther.--She was\nresolved not to be convinced, as long as she could doubt, and yet had\nno authority for opposing Harriet's confidence. To talk would be only to\nirritate.--She wrote to her, therefore, kindly, but decisively, to beg\nthat she would not, at present, come to Hartfield; acknowledging it to\nbe her conviction, that all farther confidential discussion of _one_\ntopic had better be avoided; and hoping, that if a few days were allowed\nto pass before they met again, except in the company of others--she\nobjected only to a tete-a-tete--they might be able to act as if they\nhad forgotten the conversation of yesterday.--Harriet submitted, and\napproved, and was grateful.\n\nThis point was just arranged, when a visitor arrived to tear Emma's\nthoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them,\nsleeping or waking, the last twenty-four hours--Mrs. Weston, who had\nbeen calling on her daughter-in-law elect, and took Hartfield in her\nway home, almost as much in duty to Emma as in pleasure to herself, to\nrelate all the particulars of so interesting an interview.\n\nMr. Weston had accompanied her to Mrs. Bates's, and gone through his\nshare of this essential attention most handsomely; but she having then\ninduced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing, was now returned with\nmuch more to say, and much more to say with satisfaction, than a quarter\nof an hour spent in Mrs. Bates's parlour, with all the encumbrance of\nawkward feelings, could have afforded.\n\nA little curiosity Emma had; and she made the most of it while her\nfriend related. Mrs. Weston had set off to pay the visit in a good deal\nof agitation herself; and in the first place had wished not to go at all\nat present, to be allowed merely to write to Miss Fairfax instead, and\nto defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed, and Mr.\nChurchill could be reconciled to the engagement's becoming known; as,\nconsidering every thing, she thought such a visit could not be paid\nwithout leading to reports:--but Mr. Weston had thought differently; he\nwas extremely anxious to shew his approbation to Miss Fairfax and her\nfamily, and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it;\nor if it were, that it would be of any consequence; for “such things,”\n he observed, “always got about.” Emma smiled, and felt that Mr. Weston\nhad very good reason for saying so. They had gone, in short--and very\ngreat had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady. She had\nhardly been able to speak a word, and every look and action had shewn\nhow deeply she was suffering from consciousness. The quiet, heart-felt\nsatisfaction of the old lady, and the rapturous delight of her\ndaughter--who proved even too joyous to talk as usual, had been a\ngratifying, yet almost an affecting, scene. They were both so truly\nrespectable in their happiness, so disinterested in every sensation;\nthought so much of Jane; so much of every body, and so little of\nthemselves, that every kindly feeling was at work for them. Miss\nFairfax's recent illness had offered a fair plea for Mrs. Weston to\ninvite her to an airing; she had drawn back and declined at first, but,\non being pressed had yielded; and, in the course of their drive,\nMrs. Weston had, by gentle encouragement, overcome so much of her\nembarrassment, as to bring her to converse on the important subject.\nApologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their first reception,\nand the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was always feeling\ntowards herself and Mr. Weston, must necessarily open the cause; but\nwhen these effusions were put by, they had talked a good deal of the\npresent and of the future state of the engagement. Mrs. Weston was\nconvinced that such conversation must be the greatest relief to her\ncompanion, pent up within her own mind as every thing had so long been,\nand was very much pleased with all that she had said on the subject.\n\n“On the misery of what she had suffered, during the concealment of so\nmany months,” continued Mrs. Weston, “she was energetic. This was one\nof her expressions. 'I will not say, that since I entered into the\nengagement I have not had some happy moments; but I can say, that I have\nnever known the blessing of one tranquil hour:'--and the quivering lip,\nEmma, which uttered it, was an attestation that I felt at my heart.”\n\n“Poor girl!” said Emma. “She thinks herself wrong, then, for having\nconsented to a private engagement?”\n\n“Wrong! No one, I believe, can blame her more than she is disposed\nto blame herself. 'The consequence,' said she, 'has been a state of\nperpetual suffering to me; and so it ought. But after all the punishment\nthat misconduct can bring, it is still not less misconduct. Pain is no\nexpiation. I never can be blameless. I have been acting contrary to all\nmy sense of right; and the fortunate turn that every thing has taken,\nand the kindness I am now receiving, is what my conscience tells me\nought not to be.' 'Do not imagine, madam,' she continued, 'that I was\ntaught wrong. Do not let any reflection fall on the principles or the\ncare of the friends who brought me up. The error has been all my own;\nand I do assure you that, with all the excuse that present circumstances\nmay appear to give, I shall yet dread making the story known to Colonel\nCampbell.'”\n\n“Poor girl!” said Emma again. “She loves him then excessively, I\nsuppose. It must have been from attachment only, that she could be\nled to form the engagement. Her affection must have overpowered her\njudgment.”\n\n“Yes, I have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him.”\n\n“I am afraid,” returned Emma, sighing, “that I must often have\ncontributed to make her unhappy.”\n\n“On your side, my love, it was very innocently done. But she\nprobably had something of that in her thoughts, when alluding to the\nmisunderstandings which he had given us hints of before. One natural\nconsequence of the evil she had involved herself in,” she said, “was\nthat of making her _unreasonable_. The consciousness of having done\namiss, had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes, and made her captious\nand irritable to a degree that must have been--that had been--hard for\nhim to bear. 'I did not make the allowances,' said she, 'which I ought\nto have done, for his temper and spirits--his delightful spirits, and\nthat gaiety, that playfulness of disposition, which, under any other\ncircumstances, would, I am sure, have been as constantly bewitching to\nme, as they were at first.' She then began to speak of you, and of the\ngreat kindness you had shewn her during her illness; and with a blush\nwhich shewed me how it was all connected, desired me, whenever I had\nan opportunity, to thank you--I could not thank you too much--for every\nwish and every endeavour to do her good. She was sensible that you had\nnever received any proper acknowledgment from herself.”\n\n“If I did not know her to be happy now,” said Emma, seriously, “which,\nin spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience, she\nmust be, I could not bear these thanks;--for, oh! Mrs. Weston, if there\nwere an account drawn up of the evil and the good I have done Miss\nFairfax!--Well (checking herself, and trying to be more lively), this\nis all to be forgotten. You are very kind to bring me these interesting\nparticulars. They shew her to the greatest advantage. I am sure she is\nvery good--I hope she will be very happy. It is fit that the fortune\nshould be on his side, for I think the merit will be all on hers.”\n\nSuch a conclusion could not pass unanswered by Mrs. Weston. She thought\nwell of Frank in almost every respect; and, what was more, she loved him\nvery much, and her defence was, therefore, earnest. She talked with a\ngreat deal of reason, and at least equal affection--but she had too much\nto urge for Emma's attention; it was soon gone to Brunswick Square or\nto Donwell; she forgot to attempt to listen; and when Mrs. Weston ended\nwith, “We have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for, you know,\nbut I hope it will soon come,” she was obliged to pause before she\nanswered, and at last obliged to answer at random, before she could at\nall recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for.\n\n“Are you well, my Emma?” was Mrs. Weston's parting question.\n\n“Oh! perfectly. I am always well, you know. Be sure to give me\nintelligence of the letter as soon as possible.”\n\nMrs. Weston's communications furnished Emma with more food for\nunpleasant reflection, by increasing her esteem and compassion, and her\nsense of past injustice towards Miss Fairfax. She bitterly regretted\nnot having sought a closer acquaintance with her, and blushed for the\nenvious feelings which had certainly been, in some measure, the cause.\nHad she followed Mr. Knightley's known wishes, in paying that attention\nto Miss Fairfax, which was every way her due; had she tried to know her\nbetter; had she done her part towards intimacy; had she endeavoured\nto find a friend there instead of in Harriet Smith; she must, in all\nprobability, have been spared from every pain which pressed on her\nnow.--Birth, abilities, and education, had been equally marking one as\nan associate for her, to be received with gratitude; and the other--what\nwas she?--Supposing even that they had never become intimate friends;\nthat she had never been admitted into Miss Fairfax's confidence on this\nimportant matter--which was most probable--still, in knowing her as\nshe ought, and as she might, she must have been preserved from the\nabominable suspicions of an improper attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she\nhad not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself, but had so\nunpardonably imparted; an idea which she greatly feared had been made a\nsubject of material distress to the delicacy of Jane's feelings, by the\nlevity or carelessness of Frank Churchill's. Of all the sources of evil\nsurrounding the former, since her coming to Highbury, she was persuaded\nthat she must herself have been the worst. She must have been a\nperpetual enemy. They never could have been all three together, without\nher having stabbed Jane Fairfax's peace in a thousand instances; and on\nBox Hill, perhaps, it had been the agony of a mind that would bear no\nmore.\n\nThe evening of this day was very long, and melancholy, at Hartfield.\nThe weather added what it could of gloom. A cold stormy rain set in, and\nnothing of July appeared but in the trees and shrubs, which the wind was\ndespoiling, and the length of the day, which only made such cruel sights\nthe longer visible.\n\nThe weather affected Mr. Woodhouse, and he could only be kept tolerably\ncomfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughter's side, and by\nexertions which had never cost her half so much before. It reminded\nher of their first forlorn tete-a-tete, on the evening of Mrs. Weston's\nwedding-day; but Mr. Knightley had walked in then, soon after tea,\nand dissipated every melancholy fancy. Alas! such delightful proofs of\nHartfield's attraction, as those sort of visits conveyed, might shortly\nbe over. The picture which she had then drawn of the privations of the\napproaching winter, had proved erroneous; no friends had deserted them,\nno pleasures had been lost.--But her present forebodings she feared\nwould experience no similar contradiction. The prospect before her now,\nwas threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled--that\nmight not be even partially brightened. If all took place that\nmight take place among the circle of her friends, Hartfield must be\ncomparatively deserted; and she left to cheer her father with the\nspirits only of ruined happiness.\n\nThe child to be born at Randalls must be a tie there even dearer than\nherself; and Mrs. Weston's heart and time would be occupied by it.\nThey should lose her; and, probably, in great measure, her husband\nalso.--Frank Churchill would return among them no more; and Miss\nFairfax, it was reasonable to suppose, would soon cease to belong to\nHighbury. They would be married, and settled either at or near Enscombe.\nAll that were good would be withdrawn; and if to these losses, the\nloss of Donwell were to be added, what would remain of cheerful or\nof rational society within their reach? Mr. Knightley to be no longer\ncoming there for his evening comfort!--No longer walking in at all\nhours, as if ever willing to change his own home for their's!--How was\nit to be endured? And if he were to be lost to them for Harriet's sake;\nif he were to be thought of hereafter, as finding in Harriet's society\nall that he wanted; if Harriet were to be the chosen, the first,\nthe dearest, the friend, the wife to whom he looked for all the best\nblessings of existence; what could be increasing Emma's wretchedness but\nthe reflection never far distant from her mind, that it had been all her\nown work?\n\nWhen it came to such a pitch as this, she was not able to refrain from\na start, or a heavy sigh, or even from walking about the room for a\nfew seconds--and the only source whence any thing like consolation\nor composure could be drawn, was in the resolution of her own better\nconduct, and the hope that, however inferior in spirit and gaiety might\nbe the following and every future winter of her life to the past, it\nwould yet find her more rational, more acquainted with herself, and\nleave her less to regret when it were gone.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\nThe weather continued much the same all the following morning; and\nthe same loneliness, and the same melancholy, seemed to reign at\nHartfield--but in the afternoon it cleared; the wind changed into a\nsofter quarter; the clouds were carried off; the sun appeared; it was\nsummer again. With all the eagerness which such a transition gives, Emma\nresolved to be out of doors as soon as possible. Never had the exquisite\nsight, smell, sensation of nature, tranquil, warm, and brilliant after\na storm, been more attractive to her. She longed for the serenity they\nmight gradually introduce; and on Mr. Perry's coming in soon after\ndinner, with a disengaged hour to give her father, she lost no time\nin hurrying into the shrubbery.--There, with spirits freshened, and\nthoughts a little relieved, she had taken a few turns, when she saw Mr.\nKnightley passing through the garden door, and coming towards her.--It\nwas the first intimation of his being returned from London. She had\nbeen thinking of him the moment before, as unquestionably sixteen miles\ndistant.--There was time only for the quickest arrangement of mind. She\nmust be collected and calm. In half a minute they were together. The\n“How d'ye do's” were quiet and constrained on each side. She asked after\ntheir mutual friends; they were all well.--When had he left them?--Only\nthat morning. He must have had a wet ride.--Yes.--He meant to walk with\nher, she found. “He had just looked into the dining-room, and as he was\nnot wanted there, preferred being out of doors.”--She thought he neither\nlooked nor spoke cheerfully; and the first possible cause for it,\nsuggested by her fears, was, that he had perhaps been communicating his\nplans to his brother, and was pained by the manner in which they had\nbeen received.\n\nThey walked together. He was silent. She thought he was often looking\nat her, and trying for a fuller view of her face than it suited her to\ngive. And this belief produced another dread. Perhaps he wanted to\nspeak to her, of his attachment to Harriet; he might be watching for\nencouragement to begin.--She did not, could not, feel equal to lead the\nway to any such subject. He must do it all himself. Yet she could\nnot bear this silence. With him it was most unnatural. She\nconsidered--resolved--and, trying to smile, began--\n\n“You have some news to hear, now you are come back, that will rather\nsurprize you.”\n\n“Have I?” said he quietly, and looking at her; “of what nature?”\n\n“Oh! the best nature in the world--a wedding.”\n\nAfter waiting a moment, as if to be sure she intended to say no more, he\nreplied,\n\n“If you mean Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill, I have heard that\nalready.”\n\n“How is it possible?” cried Emma, turning her glowing cheeks towards\nhim; for, while she spoke, it occurred to her that he might have called\nat Mrs. Goddard's in his way.\n\n“I had a few lines on parish business from Mr. Weston this morning, and\nat the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened.”\n\nEmma was quite relieved, and could presently say, with a little more\ncomposure,\n\n“_You_ probably have been less surprized than any of us, for you have\nhad your suspicions.--I have not forgotten that you once tried to give\nme a caution.--I wish I had attended to it--but--(with a sinking voice\nand a heavy sigh) I seem to have been doomed to blindness.”\n\nFor a moment or two nothing was said, and she was unsuspicious of having\nexcited any particular interest, till she found her arm drawn within\nhis, and pressed against his heart, and heard him thus saying, in a tone\nof great sensibility, speaking low,\n\n“Time, my dearest Emma, time will heal the wound.--Your own excellent\nsense--your exertions for your father's sake--I know you will not allow\nyourself--.” Her arm was pressed again, as he added, in a more\nbroken and subdued accent, “The feelings of the warmest\nfriendship--Indignation--Abominable scoundrel!”--And in a louder,\nsteadier tone, he concluded with, “He will soon be gone. They will soon\nbe in Yorkshire. I am sorry for _her_. She deserves a better fate.”\n\nEmma understood him; and as soon as she could recover from the flutter\nof pleasure, excited by such tender consideration, replied,\n\n“You are very kind--but you are mistaken--and I must set you right.--\nI am not in want of that sort of compassion. My blindness to what was\ngoing on, led me to act by them in a way that I must always be ashamed\nof, and I was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may\nwell lay me open to unpleasant conjectures, but I have no other reason\nto regret that I was not in the secret earlier.”\n\n“Emma!” cried he, looking eagerly at her, “are you, indeed?”--but\nchecking himself--“No, no, I understand you--forgive me--I am pleased\nthat you can say even so much.--He is no object of regret, indeed! and\nit will not be very long, I hope, before that becomes the acknowledgment\nof more than your reason.--Fortunate that your affections were not\nfarther entangled!--I could never, I confess, from your manners, assure\nmyself as to the degree of what you felt--I could only be certain that\nthere was a preference--and a preference which I never believed him to\ndeserve.--He is a disgrace to the name of man.--And is he to be rewarded\nwith that sweet young woman?--Jane, Jane, you will be a miserable\ncreature.”\n\n“Mr. Knightley,” said Emma, trying to be lively, but really confused--“I\nam in a very extraordinary situation. I cannot let you continue in your\nerror; and yet, perhaps, since my manners gave such an impression, I\nhave as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that I never have been\nat all attached to the person we are speaking of, as it might be natural\nfor a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse.--But I never\nhave.”\n\nHe listened in perfect silence. She wished him to speak, but he would\nnot. She supposed she must say more before she were entitled to his\nclemency; but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower herself in\nhis opinion. She went on, however.\n\n“I have very little to say for my own conduct.--I was tempted by his\nattentions, and allowed myself to appear pleased.--An old story,\nprobably--a common case--and no more than has happened to hundreds of my\nsex before; and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets up\nas I do for Understanding. Many circumstances assisted the temptation.\nHe was the son of Mr. Weston--he was continually here--I always found\nhim very pleasant--and, in short, for (with a sigh) let me swell out the\ncauses ever so ingeniously, they all centre in this at last--my vanity\nwas flattered, and I allowed his attentions. Latterly, however--for some\ntime, indeed--I have had no idea of their meaning any thing.--I thought\nthem a habit, a trick, nothing that called for seriousness on my side.\nHe has imposed on me, but he has not injured me. I have never been\nattached to him. And now I can tolerably comprehend his behaviour. He\nnever wished to attach me. It was merely a blind to conceal his real\nsituation with another.--It was his object to blind all about him; and\nno one, I am sure, could be more effectually blinded than myself--except\nthat I was _not_ blinded--that it was my good fortune--that, in short, I\nwas somehow or other safe from him.”\n\nShe had hoped for an answer here--for a few words to say that her\nconduct was at least intelligible; but he was silent; and, as far as she\ncould judge, deep in thought. At last, and tolerably in his usual tone,\nhe said,\n\n“I have never had a high opinion of Frank Churchill.--I can suppose,\nhowever, that I may have underrated him. My acquaintance with him has\nbeen but trifling.--And even if I have not underrated him hitherto, he\nmay yet turn out well.--With such a woman he has a chance.--I have no\nmotive for wishing him ill--and for her sake, whose happiness will be\ninvolved in his good character and conduct, I shall certainly wish him\nwell.”\n\n“I have no doubt of their being happy together,” said Emma; “I believe\nthem to be very mutually and very sincerely attached.”\n\n“He is a most fortunate man!” returned Mr. Knightley, with energy. “So\nearly in life--at three-and-twenty--a period when, if a man chuses a\nwife, he generally chuses ill. At three-and-twenty to have drawn such\na prize! What years of felicity that man, in all human calculation,\nhas before him!--Assured of the love of such a woman--the disinterested\nlove, for Jane Fairfax's character vouches for her disinterestedness;\nevery thing in his favour,--equality of situation--I mean, as far as\nregards society, and all the habits and manners that are important;\nequality in every point but one--and that one, since the purity of her\nheart is not to be doubted, such as must increase his felicity, for it\nwill be his to bestow the only advantages she wants.--A man would always\nwish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes her from;\nand he who can do it, where there is no doubt of _her_ regard, must,\nI think, be the happiest of mortals.--Frank Churchill is, indeed, the\nfavourite of fortune. Every thing turns out for his good.--He meets\nwith a young woman at a watering-place, gains her affection, cannot even\nweary her by negligent treatment--and had he and all his family sought\nround the world for a perfect wife for him, they could not have found\nher superior.--His aunt is in the way.--His aunt dies.--He has only to\nspeak.--His friends are eager to promote his happiness.--He had used\nevery body ill--and they are all delighted to forgive him.--He is a\nfortunate man indeed!”\n\n“You speak as if you envied him.”\n\n“And I do envy him, Emma. In one respect he is the object of my envy.”\n\nEmma could say no more. They seemed to be within half a sentence\nof Harriet, and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject, if\npossible. She made her plan; she would speak of something totally\ndifferent--the children in Brunswick Square; and she only waited for\nbreath to begin, when Mr. Knightley startled her, by saying,\n\n“You will not ask me what is the point of envy.--You are determined, I\nsee, to have no curiosity.--You are wise--but _I_ cannot be wise. Emma,\nI must tell you what you will not ask, though I may wish it unsaid the\nnext moment.”\n\n“Oh! then, don't speak it, don't speak it,” she eagerly cried. “Take a\nlittle time, consider, do not commit yourself.”\n\n“Thank you,” said he, in an accent of deep mortification, and not\nanother syllable followed.\n\nEmma could not bear to give him pain. He was wishing to confide in\nher--perhaps to consult her;--cost her what it would, she would listen.\nShe might assist his resolution, or reconcile him to it; she might give\njust praise to Harriet, or, by representing to him his own independence,\nrelieve him from that state of indecision, which must be more\nintolerable than any alternative to such a mind as his.--They had\nreached the house.\n\n“You are going in, I suppose?” said he.\n\n“No,”--replied Emma--quite confirmed by the depressed manner in which\nhe still spoke--“I should like to take another turn. Mr. Perry is not\ngone.” And, after proceeding a few steps, she added--“I stopped you\nungraciously, just now, Mr. Knightley, and, I am afraid, gave you\npain.--But if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend, or\nto ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplation--as\na friend, indeed, you may command me.--I will hear whatever you like. I\nwill tell you exactly what I think.”\n\n“As a friend!”--repeated Mr. Knightley.--“Emma, that I fear is a\nword--No, I have no wish--Stay, yes, why should I hesitate?--I\nhave gone too far already for concealment.--Emma, I accept your\noffer--Extraordinary as it may seem, I accept it, and refer myself to\nyou as a friend.--Tell me, then, have I no chance of ever succeeding?”\n\nHe stopped in his earnestness to look the question, and the expression\nof his eyes overpowered her.\n\n“My dearest Emma,” said he, “for dearest you will always be, whatever\nthe event of this hour's conversation, my dearest, most beloved\nEmma--tell me at once. Say 'No,' if it is to be said.”--She could\nreally say nothing.--“You are silent,” he cried, with great animation;\n“absolutely silent! at present I ask no more.”\n\nEmma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment. The\ndread of being awakened from the happiest dream, was perhaps the most\nprominent feeling.\n\n“I cannot make speeches, Emma:” he soon resumed; and in a tone of\nsuch sincere, decided, intelligible tenderness as was tolerably\nconvincing.--“If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it\nmore. But you know what I am.--You hear nothing but truth from me.--I\nhave blamed you, and lectured you, and you have borne it as no other\nwoman in England would have borne it.--Bear with the truths I would\ntell you now, dearest Emma, as well as you have borne with them. The\nmanner, perhaps, may have as little to recommend them. God knows, I have\nbeen a very indifferent lover.--But you understand me.--Yes, you see,\nyou understand my feelings--and will return them if you can. At present,\nI ask only to hear, once to hear your voice.”\n\nWhile he spoke, Emma's mind was most busy, and, with all the wonderful\nvelocity of thought, had been able--and yet without losing a word--to\ncatch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole; to see that Harriet's\nhopes had been entirely groundless, a mistake, a delusion, as complete a\ndelusion as any of her own--that Harriet was nothing; that she was every\nthing herself; that what she had been saying relative to Harriet\nhad been all taken as the language of her own feelings; and that her\nagitation, her doubts, her reluctance, her discouragement, had been all\nreceived as discouragement from herself.--And not only was there time\nfor these convictions, with all their glow of attendant happiness; there\nwas time also to rejoice that Harriet's secret had not escaped her, and\nto resolve that it need not, and should not.--It was all the service\nshe could now render her poor friend; for as to any of that heroism of\nsentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his\naffection from herself to Harriet, as infinitely the most worthy of the\ntwo--or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him at\nonce and for ever, without vouchsafing any motive, because he could not\nmarry them both, Emma had it not. She felt for Harriet, with pain and\nwith contrition; but no flight of generosity run mad, opposing all that\ncould be probable or reasonable, entered her brain. She had led her\nfriend astray, and it would be a reproach to her for ever; but her\njudgment was as strong as her feelings, and as strong as it had ever\nbeen before, in reprobating any such alliance for him, as most unequal\nand degrading. Her way was clear, though not quite smooth.--She spoke\nthen, on being so entreated.--What did she say?--Just what she ought,\nof course. A lady always does.--She said enough to shew there need not\nbe despair--and to invite him to say more himself. He _had_ despaired at\none period; he had received such an injunction to caution and silence,\nas for the time crushed every hope;--she had begun by refusing to hear\nhim.--The change had perhaps been somewhat sudden;--her proposal of\ntaking another turn, her renewing the conversation which she had\njust put an end to, might be a little extraordinary!--She felt its\ninconsistency; but Mr. Knightley was so obliging as to put up with it,\nand seek no farther explanation.\n\nSeldom, very seldom, does complete truth belong to any human disclosure;\nseldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised, or a\nlittle mistaken; but where, as in this case, though the conduct is\nmistaken, the feelings are not, it may not be very material.--Mr.\nKnightley could not impute to Emma a more relenting heart than she\npossessed, or a heart more disposed to accept of his.\n\nHe had, in fact, been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence. He had\nfollowed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it. He had come,\nin his anxiety to see how she bore Frank Churchill's engagement, with no\nselfish view, no view at all, but of endeavouring, if she allowed him an\nopening, to soothe or to counsel her.--The rest had been the work of\nthe moment, the immediate effect of what he heard, on his feelings. The\ndelightful assurance of her total indifference towards Frank Churchill,\nof her having a heart completely disengaged from him, had given birth\nto the hope, that, in time, he might gain her affection himself;--but\nit had been no present hope--he had only, in the momentary conquest of\neagerness over judgment, aspired to be told that she did not forbid his\nattempt to attach her.--The superior hopes which gradually opened were\nso much the more enchanting.--The affection, which he had been asking\nto be allowed to create, if he could, was already his!--Within half\nan hour, he had passed from a thoroughly distressed state of mind, to\nsomething so like perfect happiness, that it could bear no other name.\n\n_Her_ change was equal.--This one half-hour had given to each the same\nprecious certainty of being beloved, had cleared from each the same\ndegree of ignorance, jealousy, or distrust.--On his side, there had been\na long-standing jealousy, old as the arrival, or even the expectation,\nof Frank Churchill.--He had been in love with Emma, and jealous of Frank\nChurchill, from about the same period, one sentiment having probably\nenlightened him as to the other. It was his jealousy of Frank Churchill\nthat had taken him from the country.--The Box Hill party had decided\nhim on going away. He would save himself from witnessing again\nsuch permitted, encouraged attentions.--He had gone to learn to be\nindifferent.--But he had gone to a wrong place. There was too much\ndomestic happiness in his brother's house; woman wore too amiable a form\nin it; Isabella was too much like Emma--differing only in those striking\ninferiorities, which always brought the other in brilliancy before\nhim, for much to have been done, even had his time been longer.--He had\nstayed on, however, vigorously, day after day--till this very morning's\npost had conveyed the history of Jane Fairfax.--Then, with the gladness\nwhich must be felt, nay, which he did not scruple to feel, having never\nbelieved Frank Churchill to be at all deserving Emma, was there so much\nfond solicitude, so much keen anxiety for her, that he could stay no\nlonger. He had ridden home through the rain; and had walked up directly\nafter dinner, to see how this sweetest and best of all creatures,\nfaultless in spite of all her faults, bore the discovery.\n\nHe had found her agitated and low.--Frank Churchill was a villain.--\nHe heard her declare that she had never loved him. Frank Churchill's\ncharacter was not desperate.--She was his own Emma, by hand and word,\nwhen they returned into the house; and if he could have thought of Frank\nChurchill then, he might have deemed him a very good sort of fellow.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\nWhat totally different feelings did Emma take back into the house from\nwhat she had brought out!--she had then been only daring to hope for\na little respite of suffering;--she was now in an exquisite flutter of\nhappiness, and such happiness moreover as she believed must still be\ngreater when the flutter should have passed away.\n\nThey sat down to tea--the same party round the same table--how often\nit had been collected!--and how often had her eyes fallen on the same\nshrubs in the lawn, and observed the same beautiful effect of the\nwestern sun!--But never in such a state of spirits, never in any thing\nlike it; and it was with difficulty that she could summon enough of her\nusual self to be the attentive lady of the house, or even the attentive\ndaughter.\n\nPoor Mr. Woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him in the\nbreast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming, and so anxiously\nhoping might not have taken cold from his ride.--Could he have seen the\nheart, he would have cared very little for the lungs; but without the\nmost distant imagination of the impending evil, without the slightest\nperception of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways of either,\nhe repeated to them very comfortably all the articles of news he had\nreceived from Mr. Perry, and talked on with much self-contentment,\ntotally unsuspicious of what they could have told him in return.\n\nAs long as Mr. Knightley remained with them, Emma's fever continued;\nbut when he was gone, she began to be a little tranquillised and\nsubdued--and in the course of the sleepless night, which was the tax\nfor such an evening, she found one or two such very serious points\nto consider, as made her feel, that even her happiness must have some\nalloy. Her father--and Harriet. She could not be alone without feeling\nthe full weight of their separate claims; and how to guard the comfort\nof both to the utmost, was the question. With respect to her father,\nit was a question soon answered. She hardly knew yet what Mr. Knightley\nwould ask; but a very short parley with her own heart produced the most\nsolemn resolution of never quitting her father.--She even wept over\nthe idea of it, as a sin of thought. While he lived, it must be only an\nengagement; but she flattered herself, that if divested of the danger of\ndrawing her away, it might become an increase of comfort to him.--How\nto do her best by Harriet, was of more difficult decision;--how to spare\nher from any unnecessary pain; how to make her any possible atonement;\nhow to appear least her enemy?--On these subjects, her perplexity\nand distress were very great--and her mind had to pass again and\nagain through every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever\nsurrounded it.--She could only resolve at last, that she would still\navoid a meeting with her, and communicate all that need be told by\nletter; that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed\njust now for a time from Highbury, and--indulging in one scheme\nmore--nearly resolve, that it might be practicable to get an invitation\nfor her to Brunswick Square.--Isabella had been pleased with Harriet;\nand a few weeks spent in London must give her some amusement.--She did\nnot think it in Harriet's nature to escape being benefited by novelty\nand variety, by the streets, the shops, and the children.--At any rate,\nit would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself, from whom\nevery thing was due; a separation for the present; an averting of the\nevil day, when they must all be together again.\n\nShe rose early, and wrote her letter to Harriet; an employment which\nleft her so very serious, so nearly sad, that Mr. Knightley, in walking\nup to Hartfield to breakfast, did not arrive at all too soon; and half\nan hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again with him,\nliterally and figuratively, was quite necessary to reinstate her in a\nproper share of the happiness of the evening before.\n\nHe had not left her long, by no means long enough for her to have the\nslightest inclination for thinking of any body else, when a letter was\nbrought her from Randalls--a very thick letter;--she guessed what it\nmust contain, and deprecated the necessity of reading it.--She was now\nin perfect charity with Frank Churchill; she wanted no explanations, she\nwanted only to have her thoughts to herself--and as for understanding\nany thing he wrote, she was sure she was incapable of it.--It must be\nwaded through, however. She opened the packet; it was too surely so;--a\nnote from Mrs. Weston to herself, ushered in the letter from Frank to\nMrs. Weston.\n\n“I have the greatest pleasure, my dear Emma, in forwarding to you the\nenclosed. I know what thorough justice you will do it, and have scarcely\na doubt of its happy effect.--I think we shall never materially disagree\nabout the writer again; but I will not delay you by a long preface.--We\nare quite well.--This letter has been the cure of all the little\nnervousness I have been feeling lately.--I did not quite like your looks\non Tuesday, but it was an ungenial morning; and though you will never\nown being affected by weather, I think every body feels a north-east\nwind.--I felt for your dear father very much in the storm of Tuesday\nafternoon and yesterday morning, but had the comfort of hearing last\nnight, by Mr. Perry, that it had not made him ill.\n\n                              “Yours ever,\n                                                       “A. W.”\n\n                       [To Mrs. Weston.]\n\n\n                                                       WINDSOR-JULY.\nMY DEAR MADAM,\n\n“If I made myself intelligible yesterday, this letter will be\nexpected; but expected or not, I know it will be read with candour and\nindulgence.--You are all goodness, and I believe there will be need of\neven all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct.--But\nI have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent. My courage\nrises while I write. It is very difficult for the prosperous to be\nhumble. I have already met with such success in two applications for\npardon, that I may be in danger of thinking myself too sure of yours,\nand of those among your friends who have had any ground of offence.--You\nmust all endeavour to comprehend the exact nature of my situation when I\nfirst arrived at Randalls; you must consider me as having a secret which\nwas to be kept at all hazards. This was the fact. My right to place\nmyself in a situation requiring such concealment, is another question.\nI shall not discuss it here. For my temptation to _think_ it a right,\nI refer every caviller to a brick house, sashed windows below, and\ncasements above, in Highbury. I dared not address her openly; my\ndifficulties in the then state of Enscombe must be too well known to\nrequire definition; and I was fortunate enough to prevail, before we\nparted at Weymouth, and to induce the most upright female mind in the\ncreation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement.--Had she refused, I\nshould have gone mad.--But you will be ready to say, what was your\nhope in doing this?--What did you look forward to?--To any thing, every\nthing--to time, chance, circumstance, slow effects, sudden bursts,\nperseverance and weariness, health and sickness. Every possibility of\ngood was before me, and the first of blessings secured, in obtaining her\npromises of faith and correspondence. If you need farther explanation,\nI have the honour, my dear madam, of being your husband's son, and\nthe advantage of inheriting a disposition to hope for good, which no\ninheritance of houses or lands can ever equal the value of.--See\nme, then, under these circumstances, arriving on my first visit to\nRandalls;--and here I am conscious of wrong, for that visit might have\nbeen sooner paid. You will look back and see that I did not come till\nMiss Fairfax was in Highbury; and as _you_ were the person slighted, you\nwill forgive me instantly; but I must work on my father's compassion, by\nreminding him, that so long as I absented myself from his house, so long\nI lost the blessing of knowing you. My behaviour, during the very\nhappy fortnight which I spent with you, did not, I hope, lay me open to\nreprehension, excepting on one point. And now I come to the principal,\nthe only important part of my conduct while belonging to you, which\nexcites my own anxiety, or requires very solicitous explanation. With\nthe greatest respect, and the warmest friendship, do I mention Miss\nWoodhouse; my father perhaps will think I ought to add, with the deepest\nhumiliation.--A few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his\nopinion, and some censure I acknowledge myself liable to.--My behaviour\nto Miss Woodhouse indicated, I believe, more than it ought.--In order to\nassist a concealment so essential to me, I was led on to make more than\nan allowable use of the sort of intimacy into which we were immediately\nthrown.--I cannot deny that Miss Woodhouse was my ostensible object--but\nI am sure you will believe the declaration, that had I not been\nconvinced of her indifference, I would not have been induced by any\nselfish views to go on.--Amiable and delightful as Miss Woodhouse is,\nshe never gave me the idea of a young woman likely to be attached; and\nthat she was perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me,\nwas as much my conviction as my wish.--She received my attentions with\nan easy, friendly, goodhumoured playfulness, which exactly suited me.\nWe seemed to understand each other. From our relative situation, those\nattentions were her due, and were felt to be so.--Whether Miss Woodhouse\nbegan really to understand me before the expiration of that fortnight,\nI cannot say;--when I called to take leave of her, I remember that I was\nwithin a moment of confessing the truth, and I then fancied she was not\nwithout suspicion; but I have no doubt of her having since detected me,\nat least in some degree.--She may not have surmised the whole, but her\nquickness must have penetrated a part. I cannot doubt it. You will find,\nwhenever the subject becomes freed from its present restraints, that it\ndid not take her wholly by surprize. She frequently gave me hints of it.\nI remember her telling me at the ball, that I owed Mrs. Elton gratitude\nfor her attentions to Miss Fairfax.--I hope this history of my conduct\ntowards her will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation\nof what you saw amiss. While you considered me as having sinned against\nEmma Woodhouse, I could deserve nothing from either. Acquit me here, and\nprocure for me, when it is allowable, the acquittal and good wishes\nof that said Emma Woodhouse, whom I regard with so much brotherly\naffection, as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as\nmyself.--Whatever strange things I said or did during that fortnight,\nyou have now a key to. My heart was in Highbury, and my business was to\nget my body thither as often as might be, and with the least suspicion.\nIf you remember any queernesses, set them all to the right account.--Of\nthe pianoforte so much talked of, I feel it only necessary to say, that\nits being ordered was absolutely unknown to Miss F--, who would never\nhave allowed me to send it, had any choice been given her.--The\ndelicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement, my dear madam,\nis much beyond my power of doing justice to. You will soon, I earnestly\nhope, know her thoroughly yourself.--No description can describe her.\nShe must tell you herself what she is--yet not by word, for never\nwas there a human creature who would so designedly suppress her own\nmerit.--Since I began this letter, which will be longer than I foresaw,\nI have heard from her.--She gives a good account of her own health; but\nas she never complains, I dare not depend. I want to have your opinion\nof her looks. I know you will soon call on her; she is living in dread\nof the visit. Perhaps it is paid already. Let me hear from you without\ndelay; I am impatient for a thousand particulars. Remember how few\nminutes I was at Randalls, and in how bewildered, how mad a state: and\nI am not much better yet; still insane either from happiness or\nmisery. When I think of the kindness and favour I have met with, of her\nexcellence and patience, and my uncle's generosity, I am mad with joy:\nbut when I recollect all the uneasiness I occasioned her, and how little\nI deserve to be forgiven, I am mad with anger. If I could but see her\nagain!--But I must not propose it yet. My uncle has been too good for me\nto encroach.--I must still add to this long letter. You have not heard\nall that you ought to hear. I could not give any connected detail\nyesterday; but the suddenness, and, in one light, the unseasonableness\nwith which the affair burst out, needs explanation; for though the event\nof the 26th ult., as you will conclude, immediately opened to me the\nhappiest prospects, I should not have presumed on such early measures,\nbut from the very particular circumstances, which left me not an hour to\nlose. I should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty, and she\nwould have felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and\nrefinement.--But I had no choice. The hasty engagement she had entered\ninto with that woman--Here, my dear madam, I was obliged to leave off\nabruptly, to recollect and compose myself.--I have been walking over\nthe country, and am now, I hope, rational enough to make the rest of\nmy letter what it ought to be.--It is, in fact, a most mortifying\nretrospect for me. I behaved shamefully. And here I can admit, that\nmy manners to Miss W., in being unpleasant to Miss F., were highly\nblameable. _She_ disapproved them, which ought to have been enough.--My\nplea of concealing the truth she did not think sufficient.--She was\ndispleased; I thought unreasonably so: I thought her, on a thousand\noccasions, unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious: I thought her even\ncold. But she was always right. If I had followed her judgment, and\nsubdued my spirits to the level of what she deemed proper, I should have\nescaped the greatest unhappiness I have ever known.--We quarrelled.--\nDo you remember the morning spent at Donwell?--_There_ every little\ndissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis. I was late;\nI met her walking home by herself, and wanted to walk with her, but she\nwould not suffer it. She absolutely refused to allow me, which I then\nthought most unreasonable. Now, however, I see nothing in it but a very\nnatural and consistent degree of discretion. While I, to blind the\nworld to our engagement, was behaving one hour with objectionable\nparticularity to another woman, was she to be consenting the next to a\nproposal which might have made every previous caution useless?--Had we\nbeen met walking together between Donwell and Highbury, the truth must\nhave been suspected.--I was mad enough, however, to resent.--I doubted\nher affection. I doubted it more the next day on Box Hill; when,\nprovoked by such conduct on my side, such shameful, insolent neglect\nof her, and such apparent devotion to Miss W., as it would have been\nimpossible for any woman of sense to endure, she spoke her resentment in\na form of words perfectly intelligible to me.--In short, my dear\nmadam, it was a quarrel blameless on her side, abominable on mine; and\nI returned the same evening to Richmond, though I might have staid with\nyou till the next morning, merely because I would be as angry with\nher as possible. Even then, I was not such a fool as not to mean to\nbe reconciled in time; but I was the injured person, injured by her\ncoldness, and I went away determined that she should make the first\nadvances.--I shall always congratulate myself that you were not of\nthe Box Hill party. Had you witnessed my behaviour there, I can hardly\nsuppose you would ever have thought well of me again. Its effect upon\nher appears in the immediate resolution it produced: as soon as she\nfound I was really gone from Randalls, she closed with the offer of that\nofficious Mrs. Elton; the whole system of whose treatment of her, by the\nbye, has ever filled me with indignation and hatred. I must not quarrel\nwith a spirit of forbearance which has been so richly extended towards\nmyself; but, otherwise, I should loudly protest against the share of it\nwhich that woman has known.--'Jane,' indeed!--You will observe that I\nhave not yet indulged myself in calling her by that name, even to you.\nThink, then, what I must have endured in hearing it bandied between\nthe Eltons with all the vulgarity of needless repetition, and all the\ninsolence of imaginary superiority. Have patience with me, I shall soon\nhave done.--She closed with this offer, resolving to break with me\nentirely, and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet\nagain.--_She_ _felt_ _the_ _engagement_ _to_ _be_ _a_ _source_ _of_\n_repentance_ _and_ _misery_ _to_ _each_: _she_ _dissolved_ _it_.--This\nletter reached me on the very morning of my poor aunt's death. I\nanswered it within an hour; but from the confusion of my mind, and the\nmultiplicity of business falling on me at once, my answer, instead of\nbeing sent with all the many other letters of that day, was locked up in\nmy writing-desk; and I, trusting that I had written enough, though but\na few lines, to satisfy her, remained without any uneasiness.--I was\nrather disappointed that I did not hear from her again speedily; but I\nmade excuses for her, and was too busy, and--may I add?--too cheerful\nin my views to be captious.--We removed to Windsor; and two\ndays afterwards I received a parcel from her, my own letters all\nreturned!--and a few lines at the same time by the post, stating her\nextreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply to her last; and\nadding, that as silence on such a point could not be misconstrued,\nand as it must be equally desirable to both to have every subordinate\narrangement concluded as soon as possible, she now sent me, by a safe\nconveyance, all my letters, and requested, that if I could not directly\ncommand hers, so as to send them to Highbury within a week, I would\nforward them after that period to her at--: in short, the full direction\nto Mr. Smallridge's, near Bristol, stared me in the face. I knew the\nname, the place, I knew all about it, and instantly saw what she had\nbeen doing. It was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character\nwhich I knew her to possess; and the secrecy she had maintained, as to\nany such design in her former letter, was equally descriptive of its\nanxious delicacy. For the world would not she have seemed to threaten\nme.--Imagine the shock; imagine how, till I had actually detected my\nown blunder, I raved at the blunders of the post.--What was to be\ndone?--One thing only.--I must speak to my uncle. Without his sanction I\ncould not hope to be listened to again.--I spoke; circumstances were\nin my favour; the late event had softened away his pride, and he was,\nearlier than I could have anticipated, wholly reconciled and complying;\nand could say at last, poor man! with a deep sigh, that he wished I\nmight find as much happiness in the marriage state as he had done.--I\nfelt that it would be of a different sort.--Are you disposed to pity\nme for what I must have suffered in opening the cause to him, for my\nsuspense while all was at stake?--No; do not pity me till I reached\nHighbury, and saw how ill I had made her. Do not pity me till I saw her\nwan, sick looks.--I reached Highbury at the time of day when, from my\nknowledge of their late breakfast hour, I was certain of a good chance\nof finding her alone.--I was not disappointed; and at last I was not\ndisappointed either in the object of my journey. A great deal of very\nreasonable, very just displeasure I had to persuade away. But it is\ndone; we are reconciled, dearer, much dearer, than ever, and no moment's\nuneasiness can ever occur between us again. Now, my dear madam, I will\nrelease you; but I could not conclude before. A thousand and a thousand\nthanks for all the kindness you have ever shewn me, and ten thousand for\nthe attentions your heart will dictate towards her.--If you think me in\na way to be happier than I deserve, I am quite of your opinion.--Miss\nW. calls me the child of good fortune. I hope she is right.--In one\nrespect, my good fortune is undoubted, that of being able to subscribe\nmyself,\n\n                    Your obliged and affectionate Son,\n\n                                          F. C. WESTON CHURCHILL.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n\nThis letter must make its way to Emma's feelings. She was obliged, in\nspite of her previous determination to the contrary, to do it all the\njustice that Mrs. Weston foretold. As soon as she came to her own name,\nit was irresistible; every line relating to herself was interesting,\nand almost every line agreeable; and when this charm ceased, the subject\ncould still maintain itself, by the natural return of her former regard\nfor the writer, and the very strong attraction which any picture of\nlove must have for her at that moment. She never stopt till she had gone\nthrough the whole; and though it was impossible not to feel that he had\nbeen wrong, yet he had been less wrong than she had supposed--and he had\nsuffered, and was very sorry--and he was so grateful to Mrs. Weston, and\nso much in love with Miss Fairfax, and she was so happy herself, that\nthere was no being severe; and could he have entered the room, she must\nhave shaken hands with him as heartily as ever.\n\nShe thought so well of the letter, that when Mr. Knightley came again,\nshe desired him to read it. She was sure of Mrs. Weston's wishing it to\nbe communicated; especially to one, who, like Mr. Knightley, had seen so\nmuch to blame in his conduct.\n\n“I shall be very glad to look it over,” said he; “but it seems long. I\nwill take it home with me at night.”\n\nBut that would not do. Mr. Weston was to call in the evening, and she\nmust return it by him.\n\n“I would rather be talking to you,” he replied; “but as it seems a\nmatter of justice, it shall be done.”\n\nHe began--stopping, however, almost directly to say, “Had I been offered\nthe sight of one of this gentleman's letters to his mother-in-law a few\nmonths ago, Emma, it would not have been taken with such indifference.”\n\nHe proceeded a little farther, reading to himself; and then, with a\nsmile, observed, “Humph! a fine complimentary opening: But it is his\nway. One man's style must not be the rule of another's. We will not be\nsevere.”\n\n“It will be natural for me,” he added shortly afterwards, “to speak my\nopinion aloud as I read. By doing it, I shall feel that I am near you.\nIt will not be so great a loss of time: but if you dislike it--”\n\n“Not at all. I should wish it.”\n\nMr. Knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity.\n\n“He trifles here,” said he, “as to the temptation. He knows he is wrong,\nand has nothing rational to urge.--Bad.--He ought not to have formed the\nengagement.--'His father's disposition:'--he is unjust, however, to his\nfather. Mr. Weston's sanguine temper was a blessing on all his upright\nand honourable exertions; but Mr. Weston earned every present comfort\nbefore he endeavoured to gain it.--Very true; he did not come till Miss\nFairfax was here.”\n\n“And I have not forgotten,” said Emma, “how sure you were that he might\nhave come sooner if he would. You pass it over very handsomely--but you\nwere perfectly right.”\n\n“I was not quite impartial in my judgment, Emma:--but yet, I think--had\n_you_ not been in the case--I should still have distrusted him.”\n\nWhen he came to Miss Woodhouse, he was obliged to read the whole of it\naloud--all that related to her, with a smile; a look; a shake of the\nhead; a word or two of assent, or disapprobation; or merely of love, as\nthe subject required; concluding, however, seriously, and, after steady\nreflection, thus--\n\n“Very bad--though it might have been worse.--Playing a most dangerous\ngame. Too much indebted to the event for his acquittal.--No judge of\nhis own manners by you.--Always deceived in fact by his own wishes, and\nregardless of little besides his own convenience.--Fancying you to have\nfathomed his secret. Natural enough!--his own mind full of intrigue,\nthat he should suspect it in others.--Mystery; Finesse--how they pervert\nthe understanding! My Emma, does not every thing serve to prove more\nand more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each\nother?”\n\nEmma agreed to it, and with a blush of sensibility on Harriet's account,\nwhich she could not give any sincere explanation of.\n\n“You had better go on,” said she.\n\nHe did so, but very soon stopt again to say, “the pianoforte! Ah! That\nwas the act of a very, very young man, one too young to consider whether\nthe inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure. A\nboyish scheme, indeed!--I cannot comprehend a man's wishing to give a\nwoman any proof of affection which he knows she would rather dispense\nwith; and he did know that she would have prevented the instrument's\ncoming if she could.”\n\nAfter this, he made some progress without any pause. Frank Churchill's\nconfession of having behaved shamefully was the first thing to call for\nmore than a word in passing.\n\n“I perfectly agree with you, sir,”--was then his remark. “You did behave\nvery shamefully. You never wrote a truer line.” And having gone through\nwhat immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement, and his\npersisting to act in direct opposition to Jane Fairfax's sense of right,\nhe made a fuller pause to say, “This is very bad.--He had induced her\nto place herself, for his sake, in a situation of extreme difficulty and\nuneasiness, and it should have been his first object to prevent her from\nsuffering unnecessarily.--She must have had much more to contend\nwith, in carrying on the correspondence, than he could. He should have\nrespected even unreasonable scruples, had there been such; but hers were\nall reasonable. We must look to her one fault, and remember that she\nhad done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement, to bear that she\nshould have been in such a state of punishment.”\n\nEmma knew that he was now getting to the Box Hill party, and grew\nuncomfortable. Her own behaviour had been so very improper! She was\ndeeply ashamed, and a little afraid of his next look. It was all read,\nhowever, steadily, attentively, and without the smallest remark; and,\nexcepting one momentary glance at her, instantly withdrawn, in the fear\nof giving pain--no remembrance of Box Hill seemed to exist.\n\n“There is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends, the\nEltons,” was his next observation.--“His feelings are natural.--What!\nactually resolve to break with him entirely!--She felt the engagement to\nbe a source of repentance and misery to each--she dissolved it.--What a\nview this gives of her sense of his behaviour!--Well, he must be a most\nextraordinary--”\n\n“Nay, nay, read on.--You will find how very much he suffers.”\n\n“I hope he does,” replied Mr. Knightley coolly, and resuming the letter.\n“'Smallridge!'--What does this mean? What is all this?”\n\n“She had engaged to go as governess to Mrs. Smallridge's children--a\ndear friend of Mrs. Elton's--a neighbour of Maple Grove; and, by the\nbye, I wonder how Mrs. Elton bears the disappointment?”\n\n“Say nothing, my dear Emma, while you oblige me to read--not even of\nMrs. Elton. Only one page more. I shall soon have done. What a letter\nthe man writes!”\n\n“I wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him.”\n\n“Well, there _is_ feeling here.--He does seem to have suffered in\nfinding her ill.--Certainly, I can have no doubt of his being fond of\nher. 'Dearer, much dearer than ever.' I hope he may long continue to\nfeel all the value of such a reconciliation.--He is a very liberal\nthanker, with his thousands and tens of thousands.--'Happier than I\ndeserve.' Come, he knows himself there. 'Miss Woodhouse calls me the\nchild of good fortune.'--Those were Miss Woodhouse's words, were they?--\nAnd a fine ending--and there is the letter. The child of good fortune!\nThat was your name for him, was it?”\n\n“You do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as I am; but still\nyou must, at least I hope you must, think the better of him for it. I\nhope it does him some service with you.”\n\n“Yes, certainly it does. He has had great faults, faults of\ninconsideration and thoughtlessness; and I am very much of his opinion\nin thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves: but still as he\nis, beyond a doubt, really attached to Miss Fairfax, and will soon, it\nmay be hoped, have the advantage of being constantly with her, I am very\nready to believe his character will improve, and acquire from hers the\nsteadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants. And now, let me talk\nto you of something else. I have another person's interest at present\nso much at heart, that I cannot think any longer about Frank Churchill.\nEver since I left you this morning, Emma, my mind has been hard at work\non one subject.”\n\nThe subject followed; it was in plain, unaffected, gentlemanlike\nEnglish, such as Mr. Knightley used even to the woman he was in love\nwith, how to be able to ask her to marry him, without attacking the\nhappiness of her father. Emma's answer was ready at the first word.\n“While her dear father lived, any change of condition must be impossible\nfor her. She could never quit him.” Part only of this answer, however,\nwas admitted. The impossibility of her quitting her father, Mr.\nKnightley felt as strongly as herself; but the inadmissibility of any\nother change, he could not agree to. He had been thinking it over most\ndeeply, most intently; he had at first hoped to induce Mr. Woodhouse to\nremove with her to Donwell; he had wanted to believe it feasible, but\nhis knowledge of Mr. Woodhouse would not suffer him to deceive himself\nlong; and now he confessed his persuasion, that such a transplantation\nwould be a risk of her father's comfort, perhaps even of his life, which\nmust not be hazarded. Mr. Woodhouse taken from Hartfield!--No, he felt\nthat it ought not to be attempted. But the plan which had arisen on the\nsacrifice of this, he trusted his dearest Emma would not find in any\nrespect objectionable; it was, that he should be received at Hartfield;\nthat so long as her father's happiness--in other words, his life--required\nHartfield to continue her home, it should be his likewise.\n\nOf their all removing to Donwell, Emma had already had her own passing\nthoughts. Like him, she had tried the scheme and rejected it; but such\nan alternative as this had not occurred to her. She was sensible of all\nthe affection it evinced. She felt that, in quitting Donwell, he must\nbe sacrificing a great deal of independence of hours and habits; that\nin living constantly with her father, and in no house of his own, there\nwould be much, very much, to be borne with. She promised to think of it,\nand advised him to think of it more; but he was fully convinced, that no\nreflection could alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject. He had\ngiven it, he could assure her, very long and calm consideration; he had\nbeen walking away from William Larkins the whole morning, to have his\nthoughts to himself.\n\n“Ah! there is one difficulty unprovided for,” cried Emma. “I am sure\nWilliam Larkins will not like it. You must get his consent before you\nask mine.”\n\nShe promised, however, to think of it; and pretty nearly promised,\nmoreover, to think of it, with the intention of finding it a very good\nscheme.\n\nIt is remarkable, that Emma, in the many, very many, points of view in\nwhich she was now beginning to consider Donwell Abbey, was never\nstruck with any sense of injury to her nephew Henry, whose rights as\nheir-expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded. Think she must\nof the possible difference to the poor little boy; and yet she only\ngave herself a saucy conscious smile about it, and found amusement in\ndetecting the real cause of that violent dislike of Mr. Knightley's\nmarrying Jane Fairfax, or any body else, which at the time she had\nwholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt.\n\nThis proposal of his, this plan of marrying and continuing at\nHartfield--the more she contemplated it, the more pleasing it became.\nHis evils seemed to lessen, her own advantages to increase, their mutual\ngood to outweigh every drawback. Such a companion for herself in the\nperiods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her!--Such a partner in\nall those duties and cares to which time must be giving increase of\nmelancholy!\n\nShe would have been too happy but for poor Harriet; but every blessing\nof her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her friend,\nwho must now be even excluded from Hartfield. The delightful family\nparty which Emma was securing for herself, poor Harriet must, in mere\ncharitable caution, be kept at a distance from. She would be a loser in\nevery way. Emma could not deplore her future absence as any deduction\nfrom her own enjoyment. In such a party, Harriet would be rather a\ndead weight than otherwise; but for the poor girl herself, it seemed a\npeculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing her in such a state of\nunmerited punishment.\n\nIn time, of course, Mr. Knightley would be forgotten, that is,\nsupplanted; but this could not be expected to happen very early. Mr.\nKnightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure;--not\nlike Mr. Elton. Mr. Knightley, always so kind, so feeling, so truly\nconsiderate for every body, would never deserve to be less worshipped\nthan now; and it really was too much to hope even of Harriet, that she\ncould be in love with more than _three_ men in one year.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\nIt was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet as desirous as\nherself to avoid a meeting. Their intercourse was painful enough by\nletter. How much worse, had they been obliged to meet!\n\nHarriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed, without\nreproaches, or apparent sense of ill-usage; and yet Emma fancied there\nwas a something of resentment, a something bordering on it in her style,\nwhich increased the desirableness of their being separate.--It might be\nonly her own consciousness; but it seemed as if an angel only could have\nbeen quite without resentment under such a stroke.\n\nShe had no difficulty in procuring Isabella's invitation; and she was\nfortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it, without resorting\nto invention.--There was a tooth amiss. Harriet really wished, and\nhad wished some time, to consult a dentist. Mrs. John Knightley was\ndelighted to be of use; any thing of ill health was a recommendation to\nher--and though not so fond of a dentist as of a Mr. Wingfield, she was\nquite eager to have Harriet under her care.--When it was thus settled\non her sister's side, Emma proposed it to her friend, and found her\nvery persuadable.--Harriet was to go; she was invited for at least a\nfortnight; she was to be conveyed in Mr. Woodhouse's carriage.--It was\nall arranged, it was all completed, and Harriet was safe in Brunswick\nSquare.\n\nNow Emma could, indeed, enjoy Mr. Knightley's visits; now she could\ntalk, and she could listen with true happiness, unchecked by that sense\nof injustice, of guilt, of something most painful, which had haunted her\nwhen remembering how disappointed a heart was near her, how much might\nat that moment, and at a little distance, be enduring by the feelings\nwhich she had led astray herself.\n\nThe difference of Harriet at Mrs. Goddard's, or in London, made perhaps\nan unreasonable difference in Emma's sensations; but she could not think\nof her in London without objects of curiosity and employment, which must\nbe averting the past, and carrying her out of herself.\n\nShe would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place\nin her mind which Harriet had occupied. There was a communication before\nher, one which _she_ only could be competent to make--the confession of\nher engagement to her father; but she would have nothing to do with it\nat present.--She had resolved to defer the disclosure till Mrs. Weston\nwere safe and well. No additional agitation should be thrown at this\nperiod among those she loved--and the evil should not act on herself\nby anticipation before the appointed time.--A fortnight, at least, of\nleisure and peace of mind, to crown every warmer, but more agitating,\ndelight, should be hers.\n\nShe soon resolved, equally as a duty and a pleasure, to employ half an\nhour of this holiday of spirits in calling on Miss Fairfax.--She ought\nto go--and she was longing to see her; the resemblance of their present\nsituations increasing every other motive of goodwill. It would be a\n_secret_ satisfaction; but the consciousness of a similarity of prospect\nwould certainly add to the interest with which she should attend to any\nthing Jane might communicate.\n\nShe went--she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door, but had not\nbeen into the house since the morning after Box Hill, when poor Jane had\nbeen in such distress as had filled her with compassion, though all the\nworst of her sufferings had been unsuspected.--The fear of being still\nunwelcome, determined her, though assured of their being at home, to\nwait in the passage, and send up her name.--She heard Patty announcing\nit; but no such bustle succeeded as poor Miss Bates had before made so\nhappily intelligible.--No; she heard nothing but the instant reply of,\n“Beg her to walk up;”--and a moment afterwards she was met on the stairs\nby Jane herself, coming eagerly forward, as if no other reception of her\nwere felt sufficient.--Emma had never seen her look so well, so lovely,\nso engaging. There was consciousness, animation, and warmth; there was\nevery thing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted.--\nShe came forward with an offered hand; and said, in a low, but very\nfeeling tone,\n\n“This is most kind, indeed!--Miss Woodhouse, it is impossible for me\nto express--I hope you will believe--Excuse me for being so entirely\nwithout words.”\n\nEmma was gratified, and would soon have shewn no want of words, if the\nsound of Mrs. Elton's voice from the sitting-room had not checked\nher, and made it expedient to compress all her friendly and all her\ncongratulatory sensations into a very, very earnest shake of the hand.\n\nMrs. Bates and Mrs. Elton were together. Miss Bates was out, which\naccounted for the previous tranquillity. Emma could have wished Mrs.\nElton elsewhere; but she was in a humour to have patience with every\nbody; and as Mrs. Elton met her with unusual graciousness, she hoped the\nrencontre would do them no harm.\n\nShe soon believed herself to penetrate Mrs. Elton's thoughts, and\nunderstand why she was, like herself, in happy spirits; it was being in\nMiss Fairfax's confidence, and fancying herself acquainted with what was\nstill a secret to other people. Emma saw symptoms of it immediately in\nthe expression of her face; and while paying her own compliments to Mrs.\nBates, and appearing to attend to the good old lady's replies, she saw\nher with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she\nhad apparently been reading aloud to Miss Fairfax, and return it into\nthe purple and gold reticule by her side, saying, with significant nods,\n\n“We can finish this some other time, you know. You and I shall not want\nopportunities. And, in fact, you have heard all the essential already. I\nonly wanted to prove to you that Mrs. S. admits our apology, and is\nnot offended. You see how delightfully she writes. Oh! she is a sweet\ncreature! You would have doated on her, had you gone.--But not a word\nmore. Let us be discreet--quite on our good behaviour.--Hush!--You\nremember those lines--I forget the poem at this moment:\n\n        “For when a lady's in the case,\n        “You know all other things give place.”\n\nNow I say, my dear, in _our_ case, for _lady_, read----mum! a word to\nthe wise.--I am in a fine flow of spirits, an't I? But I want to set\nyour heart at ease as to Mrs. S.--_My_ representation, you see, has\nquite appeased her.”\n\nAnd again, on Emma's merely turning her head to look at Mrs. Bates's\nknitting, she added, in a half whisper,\n\n“I mentioned no _names_, you will observe.--Oh! no; cautious as a\nminister of state. I managed it extremely well.”\n\nEmma could not doubt. It was a palpable display, repeated on every\npossible occasion. When they had all talked a little while in harmony of\nthe weather and Mrs. Weston, she found herself abruptly addressed with,\n\n“Do not you think, Miss Woodhouse, our saucy little friend here is\ncharmingly recovered?--Do not you think her cure does Perry the highest\ncredit?--(here was a side-glance of great meaning at Jane.) Upon my\nword, Perry has restored her in a wonderful short time!--Oh! if you had\nseen her, as I did, when she was at the worst!”--And when Mrs. Bates\nwas saying something to Emma, whispered farther, “We do not say a word\nof any _assistance_ that Perry might have; not a word of a certain young\nphysician from Windsor.--Oh! no; Perry shall have all the credit.”\n\n“I have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you, Miss Woodhouse,” she\nshortly afterwards began, “since the party to Box Hill. Very pleasant\nparty. But yet I think there was something wanting. Things did not\nseem--that is, there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits of some.--So\nit appeared to me at least, but I might be mistaken. However, I think\nit answered so far as to tempt one to go again. What say you both to our\ncollecting the same party, and exploring to Box Hill again, while the\nfine weather lasts?--It must be the same party, you know, quite the\nsame party, not _one_ exception.”\n\nSoon after this Miss Bates came in, and Emma could not help being\ndiverted by the perplexity of her first answer to herself, resulting,\nshe supposed, from doubt of what might be said, and impatience to say\nevery thing.\n\n“Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse, you are all kindness.--It is impossible\nto say--Yes, indeed, I quite understand--dearest Jane's prospects--that\nis, I do not mean.--But she is charmingly recovered.--How is Mr.\nWoodhouse?--I am so glad.--Quite out of my power.--Such a happy little\ncircle as you find us here.--Yes, indeed.--Charming young man!--that\nis--so very friendly; I mean good Mr. Perry!--such attention to\nJane!”--And from her great, her more than commonly thankful delight\ntowards Mrs. Elton for being there, Emma guessed that there had been a\nlittle show of resentment towards Jane, from the vicarage quarter,\nwhich was now graciously overcome.--After a few whispers, indeed, which\nplaced it beyond a guess, Mrs. Elton, speaking louder, said,\n\n“Yes, here I am, my good friend; and here I have been so long, that\nanywhere else I should think it necessary to apologise; but, the truth\nis, that I am waiting for my lord and master. He promised to join me\nhere, and pay his respects to you.”\n\n“What! are we to have the pleasure of a call from Mr. Elton?--That will\nbe a favour indeed! for I know gentlemen do not like morning visits, and\nMr. Elton's time is so engaged.”\n\n“Upon my word it is, Miss Bates.--He really is engaged from morning to\nnight.--There is no end of people's coming to him, on some pretence or\nother.--The magistrates, and overseers, and churchwardens, are always\nwanting his opinion. They seem not able to do any thing without\nhim.--'Upon my word, Mr. E.,' I often say, 'rather you than I.--I do\nnot know what would become of my crayons and my instrument, if I had\nhalf so many applicants.'--Bad enough as it is, for I absolutely neglect\nthem both to an unpardonable degree.--I believe I have not played a bar\nthis fortnight.--However, he is coming, I assure you: yes, indeed, on\npurpose to wait on you all.” And putting up her hand to screen her\nwords from Emma--“A congratulatory visit, you know.--Oh! yes, quite\nindispensable.”\n\nMiss Bates looked about her, so happily--!\n\n“He promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself\nfrom Knightley; but he and Knightley are shut up together in deep\nconsultation.--Mr. E. is Knightley's right hand.”\n\nEmma would not have smiled for the world, and only said, “Is Mr. Elton\ngone on foot to Donwell?--He will have a hot walk.”\n\n“Oh! no, it is a meeting at the Crown, a regular meeting. Weston and\nCole will be there too; but one is apt to speak only of those who\nlead.--I fancy Mr. E. and Knightley have every thing their own way.”\n\n“Have not you mistaken the day?” said Emma. “I am almost certain that\nthe meeting at the Crown is not till to-morrow.--Mr. Knightley was at\nHartfield yesterday, and spoke of it as for Saturday.”\n\n“Oh! no, the meeting is certainly to-day,” was the abrupt answer, which\ndenoted the impossibility of any blunder on Mrs. Elton's side.--“I do\nbelieve,” she continued, “this is the most troublesome parish that ever\nwas. We never heard of such things at Maple Grove.”\n\n“Your parish there was small,” said Jane.\n\n“Upon my word, my dear, I do not know, for I never heard the subject\ntalked of.”\n\n“But it is proved by the smallness of the school, which I have heard\nyou speak of, as under the patronage of your sister and Mrs. Bragge; the\nonly school, and not more than five-and-twenty children.”\n\n“Ah! you clever creature, that's very true. What a thinking brain you\nhave! I say, Jane, what a perfect character you and I should make, if we\ncould be shaken together. My liveliness and your solidity would produce\nperfection.--Not that I presume to insinuate, however, that _some_\npeople may not think _you_ perfection already.--But hush!--not a word,\nif you please.”\n\nIt seemed an unnecessary caution; Jane was wanting to give her words,\nnot to Mrs. Elton, but to Miss Woodhouse, as the latter plainly saw.\nThe wish of distinguishing her, as far as civility permitted, was very\nevident, though it could not often proceed beyond a look.\n\nMr. Elton made his appearance. His lady greeted him with some of her\nsparkling vivacity.\n\n“Very pretty, sir, upon my word; to send me on here, to be an\nencumbrance to my friends, so long before you vouchsafe to come!--But\nyou knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with. You knew I should\nnot stir till my lord and master appeared.--Here have I been sitting\nthis hour, giving these young ladies a sample of true conjugal\nobedience--for who can say, you know, how soon it may be wanted?”\n\nMr. Elton was so hot and tired, that all this wit seemed thrown away.\nHis civilities to the other ladies must be paid; but his subsequent\nobject was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering, and the\nwalk he had had for nothing.\n\n“When I got to Donwell,” said he, “Knightley could not be found. Very\nodd! very unaccountable! after the note I sent him this morning, and the\nmessage he returned, that he should certainly be at home till one.”\n\n“Donwell!” cried his wife.--“My dear Mr. E., you have not been to\nDonwell!--You mean the Crown; you come from the meeting at the Crown.”\n\n“No, no, that's to-morrow; and I particularly wanted to see Knightley\nto-day on that very account.--Such a dreadful broiling morning!--I went\nover the fields too--(speaking in a tone of great ill-usage,) which made\nit so much the worse. And then not to find him at home! I assure you\nI am not at all pleased. And no apology left, no message for me. The\nhousekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected.--Very\nextraordinary!--And nobody knew at all which way he was gone. Perhaps\nto Hartfield, perhaps to the Abbey Mill, perhaps into his woods.--Miss\nWoodhouse, this is not like our friend Knightley!--Can you explain it?”\n\nEmma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary,\nindeed, and that she had not a syllable to say for him.\n\n“I cannot imagine,” said Mrs. Elton, (feeling the indignity as a wife\nought to do,) “I cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you, of\nall people in the world! The very last person whom one should expect to\nbe forgotten!--My dear Mr. E., he must have left a message for you, I am\nsure he must.--Not even Knightley could be so very eccentric;--and his\nservants forgot it. Depend upon it, that was the case: and very likely\nto happen with the Donwell servants, who are all, I have often observed,\nextremely awkward and remiss.--I am sure I would not have such a\ncreature as his Harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration. And\nas for Mrs. Hodges, Wright holds her very cheap indeed.--She promised\nWright a receipt, and never sent it.”\n\n“I met William Larkins,” continued Mr. Elton, “as I got near the house,\nand he told me I should not find his master at home, but I did not\nbelieve him.--William seemed rather out of humour. He did not know what\nwas come to his master lately, he said, but he could hardly ever get the\nspeech of him. I have nothing to do with William's wants, but it really\nis of very great importance that _I_ should see Knightley to-day; and it\nbecomes a matter, therefore, of very serious inconvenience that I should\nhave had this hot walk to no purpose.”\n\nEmma felt that she could not do better than go home directly. In\nall probability she was at this very time waited for there; and Mr.\nKnightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression towards\nMr. Elton, if not towards William Larkins.\n\nShe was pleased, on taking leave, to find Miss Fairfax determined to\nattend her out of the room, to go with her even downstairs; it gave her\nan opportunity which she immediately made use of, to say,\n\n“It is as well, perhaps, that I have not had the possibility. Had you\nnot been surrounded by other friends, I might have been tempted to\nintroduce a subject, to ask questions, to speak more openly than might\nhave been strictly correct.--I feel that I should certainly have been\nimpertinent.”\n\n“Oh!” cried Jane, with a blush and an hesitation which Emma thought\ninfinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her usual\ncomposure--“there would have been no danger. The danger would have\nbeen of my wearying you. You could not have gratified me more than\nby expressing an interest--. Indeed, Miss Woodhouse, (speaking more\ncollectedly,) with the consciousness which I have of misconduct, very\ngreat misconduct, it is particularly consoling to me to know that those\nof my friends, whose good opinion is most worth preserving, are not\ndisgusted to such a degree as to--I have not time for half that I could\nwish to say. I long to make apologies, excuses, to urge something for\nmyself. I feel it so very due. But, unfortunately--in short, if your\ncompassion does not stand my friend--”\n\n“Oh! you are too scrupulous, indeed you are,” cried Emma warmly, and\ntaking her hand. “You owe me no apologies; and every body to whom you\nmight be supposed to owe them, is so perfectly satisfied, so delighted\neven--”\n\n“You are very kind, but I know what my manners were to you.--So\ncold and artificial!--I had always a part to act.--It was a life of\ndeceit!--I know that I must have disgusted you.”\n\n“Pray say no more. I feel that all the apologies should be on my side.\nLet us forgive each other at once. We must do whatever is to be done\nquickest, and I think our feelings will lose no time there. I hope you\nhave pleasant accounts from Windsor?”\n\n“Very.”\n\n“And the next news, I suppose, will be, that we are to lose you--just as\nI begin to know you.”\n\n“Oh! as to all that, of course nothing can be thought of yet. I am here\ntill claimed by Colonel and Mrs. Campbell.”\n\n“Nothing can be actually settled yet, perhaps,” replied Emma,\nsmiling--“but, excuse me, it must be thought of.”\n\nThe smile was returned as Jane answered,\n\n“You are very right; it has been thought of. And I will own to you, (I\nam sure it will be safe), that so far as our living with Mr. Churchill\nat Enscombe, it is settled. There must be three months, at least, of\ndeep mourning; but when they are over, I imagine there will be nothing\nmore to wait for.”\n\n“Thank you, thank you.--This is just what I wanted to be assured\nof.--Oh! if you knew how much I love every thing that is decided and\nopen!--Good-bye, good-bye.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n\nMrs. Weston's friends were all made happy by her safety; and if the\nsatisfaction of her well-doing could be increased to Emma, it was by\nknowing her to be the mother of a little girl. She had been decided in\nwishing for a Miss Weston. She would not acknowledge that it was with\nany view of making a match for her, hereafter, with either of Isabella's\nsons; but she was convinced that a daughter would suit both father\nand mother best. It would be a great comfort to Mr. Weston, as he grew\nolder--and even Mr. Weston might be growing older ten years hence--to\nhave his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense, the freaks\nand the fancies of a child never banished from home; and Mrs. Weston--no\none could doubt that a daughter would be most to her; and it would be\nquite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach, should not have\ntheir powers in exercise again.\n\n“She has had the advantage, you know, of practising on me,” she\ncontinued--“like La Baronne d'Almane on La Comtesse d'Ostalis, in Madame\nde Genlis' Adelaide and Theodore, and we shall now see her own little\nAdelaide educated on a more perfect plan.”\n\n“That is,” replied Mr. Knightley, “she will indulge her even more than\nshe did you, and believe that she does not indulge her at all. It will\nbe the only difference.”\n\n“Poor child!” cried Emma; “at that rate, what will become of her?”\n\n“Nothing very bad.--The fate of thousands. She will be disagreeable\nin infancy, and correct herself as she grows older. I am losing all my\nbitterness against spoilt children, my dearest Emma. I, who am owing all\nmy happiness to _you_, would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to be\nsevere on them?”\n\nEmma laughed, and replied: “But I had the assistance of all your\nendeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people. I doubt whether\nmy own sense would have corrected me without it.”\n\n“Do you?--I have no doubt. Nature gave you understanding:--Miss Taylor\ngave you principles. You must have done well. My interference was quite\nas likely to do harm as good. It was very natural for you to say, what\nright has he to lecture me?--and I am afraid very natural for you to\nfeel that it was done in a disagreeable manner. I do not believe I did\nyou any good. The good was all to myself, by making you an object of the\ntenderest affection to me. I could not think about you so much without\ndoating on you, faults and all; and by dint of fancying so many errors,\nhave been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least.”\n\n“I am sure you were of use to me,” cried Emma. “I was very often\ninfluenced rightly by you--oftener than I would own at the time. I\nam very sure you did me good. And if poor little Anna Weston is to be\nspoiled, it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her\nas you have done for me, except falling in love with her when she is\nthirteen.”\n\n“How often, when you were a girl, have you said to me, with one of your\nsaucy looks--'Mr. Knightley, I am going to do so-and-so; papa says I\nmay, or I have Miss Taylor's leave'--something which, you knew, I\ndid not approve. In such cases my interference was giving you two bad\nfeelings instead of one.”\n\n“What an amiable creature I was!--No wonder you should hold my speeches\nin such affectionate remembrance.”\n\n“'Mr. Knightley.'--You always called me, 'Mr. Knightley;' and, from\nhabit, it has not so very formal a sound.--And yet it is formal. I want\nyou to call me something else, but I do not know what.”\n\n“I remember once calling you 'George,' in one of my amiable fits, about\nten years ago. I did it because I thought it would offend you; but, as\nyou made no objection, I never did it again.”\n\n“And cannot you call me 'George' now?”\n\n“Impossible!--I never can call you any thing but 'Mr. Knightley.' I\nwill not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of Mrs. Elton, by\ncalling you Mr. K.--But I will promise,” she added presently, laughing\nand blushing--“I will promise to call you once by your Christian name.\nI do not say when, but perhaps you may guess where;--in the building in\nwhich N. takes M. for better, for worse.”\n\nEmma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one important\nservice which his better sense would have rendered her, to the\nadvice which would have saved her from the worst of all her womanly\nfollies--her wilful intimacy with Harriet Smith; but it was too tender a\nsubject.--She could not enter on it.--Harriet was very seldom mentioned\nbetween them. This, on his side, might merely proceed from her not being\nthought of; but Emma was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy,\nand a suspicion, from some appearances, that their friendship were\ndeclining. She was aware herself, that, parting under any other\ncircumstances, they certainly should have corresponded more, and that\nher intelligence would not have rested, as it now almost wholly did, on\nIsabella's letters. He might observe that it was so. The pain of being\nobliged to practise concealment towards him, was very little inferior to\nthe pain of having made Harriet unhappy.\n\nIsabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be\nexpected; on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits, which\nappeared perfectly natural, as there was a dentist to be consulted; but,\nsince that business had been over, she did not appear to find Harriet\ndifferent from what she had known her before.--Isabella, to be sure,\nwas no very quick observer; yet if Harriet had not been equal to playing\nwith the children, it would not have escaped her. Emma's comforts and\nhopes were most agreeably carried on, by Harriet's being to stay longer;\nher fortnight was likely to be a month at least. Mr. and Mrs. John\nKnightley were to come down in August, and she was invited to remain\ntill they could bring her back.\n\n“John does not even mention your friend,” said Mr. Knightley. “Here is\nhis answer, if you like to see it.”\n\nIt was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage. Emma\naccepted it with a very eager hand, with an impatience all alive to know\nwhat he would say about it, and not at all checked by hearing that her\nfriend was unmentioned.\n\n“John enters like a brother into my happiness,” continued Mr. Knightley,\n“but he is no complimenter; and though I well know him to have,\nlikewise, a most brotherly affection for you, he is so far from making\nflourishes, that any other young woman might think him rather cool in\nher praise. But I am not afraid of your seeing what he writes.”\n\n“He writes like a sensible man,” replied Emma, when she had read the\nletter. “I honour his sincerity. It is very plain that he considers the\ngood fortune of the engagement as all on my side, but that he is not\nwithout hope of my growing, in time, as worthy of your affection, as\nyou think me already. Had he said any thing to bear a different\nconstruction, I should not have believed him.”\n\n“My Emma, he means no such thing. He only means--”\n\n“He and I should differ very little in our estimation of the two,”\n interrupted she, with a sort of serious smile--“much less, perhaps, than\nhe is aware of, if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the\nsubject.”\n\n“Emma, my dear Emma--”\n\n“Oh!” she cried with more thorough gaiety, “if you fancy your brother\ndoes not do me justice, only wait till my dear father is in the secret,\nand hear his opinion. Depend upon it, he will be much farther from doing\n_you_ justice. He will think all the happiness, all the advantage, on\nyour side of the question; all the merit on mine. I wish I may not\nsink into 'poor Emma' with him at once.--His tender compassion towards\noppressed worth can go no farther.”\n\n“Ah!” he cried, “I wish your father might be half as easily convinced as\nJohn will be, of our having every right that equal worth can give, to be\nhappy together. I am amused by one part of John's letter--did you notice\nit?--where he says, that my information did not take him wholly by\nsurprize, that he was rather in expectation of hearing something of the\nkind.”\n\n“If I understand your brother, he only means so far as your having\nsome thoughts of marrying. He had no idea of me. He seems perfectly\nunprepared for that.”\n\n“Yes, yes--but I am amused that he should have seen so far into my\nfeelings. What has he been judging by?--I am not conscious of any\ndifference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at\nthis time for my marrying any more than at another.--But it was so, I\nsuppose. I dare say there was a difference when I was staying with them\nthe other day. I believe I did not play with the children quite so much\nas usual. I remember one evening the poor boys saying, 'Uncle seems\nalways tired now.'”\n\nThe time was coming when the news must spread farther, and other\npersons' reception of it tried. As soon as Mrs. Weston was sufficiently\nrecovered to admit Mr. Woodhouse's visits, Emma having it in view that\nher gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause, resolved first to\nannounce it at home, and then at Randalls.--But how to break it to her\nfather at last!--She had bound herself to do it, in such an hour of Mr.\nKnightley's absence, or when it came to the point her heart would have\nfailed her, and she must have put it off; but Mr. Knightley was to come\nat such a time, and follow up the beginning she was to make.--She was\nforced to speak, and to speak cheerfully too. She must not make it a\nmore decided subject of misery to him, by a melancholy tone herself.\nShe must not appear to think it a misfortune.--With all the spirits she\ncould command, she prepared him first for something strange, and then,\nin a few words, said, that if his consent and approbation could be\nobtained--which, she trusted, would be attended with no difficulty,\nsince it was a plan to promote the happiness of all--she and Mr.\nKnightley meant to marry; by which means Hartfield would receive the\nconstant addition of that person's company whom she knew he loved, next\nto his daughters and Mrs. Weston, best in the world.\n\nPoor man!--it was at first a considerable shock to him, and he tried\nearnestly to dissuade her from it. She was reminded, more than once, of\nhaving always said she would never marry, and assured that it would be\na great deal better for her to remain single; and told of poor Isabella,\nand poor Miss Taylor.--But it would not do. Emma hung about him\naffectionately, and smiled, and said it must be so; and that he must\nnot class her with Isabella and Mrs. Weston, whose marriages taking them\nfrom Hartfield, had, indeed, made a melancholy change: but she was not\ngoing from Hartfield; she should be always there; she was introducing\nno change in their numbers or their comforts but for the better; and she\nwas very sure that he would be a great deal the happier for having Mr.\nKnightley always at hand, when he were once got used to the idea.--Did\nhe not love Mr. Knightley very much?--He would not deny that he did,\nshe was sure.--Whom did he ever want to consult on business but Mr.\nKnightley?--Who was so useful to him, who so ready to write his letters,\nwho so glad to assist him?--Who so cheerful, so attentive, so attached\nto him?--Would not he like to have him always on the spot?--Yes. That\nwas all very true. Mr. Knightley could not be there too often; he should\nbe glad to see him every day;--but they did see him every day as it\nwas.--Why could not they go on as they had done?\n\nMr. Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled; but the worst was overcome,\nthe idea was given; time and continual repetition must do the rest.--To\nEmma's entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr. Knightley's, whose fond\npraise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome; and he was soon\nused to be talked to by each, on every fair occasion.--They had all\nthe assistance which Isabella could give, by letters of the strongest\napprobation; and Mrs. Weston was ready, on the first meeting, to\nconsider the subject in the most serviceable light--first, as a settled,\nand, secondly, as a good one--well aware of the nearly equal importance\nof the two recommendations to Mr. Woodhouse's mind.--It was agreed\nupon, as what was to be; and every body by whom he was used to be\nguided assuring him that it would be for his happiness; and having some\nfeelings himself which almost admitted it, he began to think that some\ntime or other--in another year or two, perhaps--it might not be so very\nbad if the marriage did take place.\n\nMrs. Weston was acting no part, feigning no feelings in all that she\nsaid to him in favour of the event.--She had been extremely surprized,\nnever more so, than when Emma first opened the affair to her; but she\nsaw in it only increase of happiness to all, and had no scruple in\nurging him to the utmost.--She had such a regard for Mr. Knightley, as\nto think he deserved even her dearest Emma; and it was in every respect\nso proper, suitable, and unexceptionable a connexion, and in one\nrespect, one point of the highest importance, so peculiarly eligible,\nso singularly fortunate, that now it seemed as if Emma could not safely\nhave attached herself to any other creature, and that she had herself\nbeen the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it, and wished it\nlong ago.--How very few of those men in a rank of life to address Emma\nwould have renounced their own home for Hartfield! And who but Mr.\nKnightley could know and bear with Mr. Woodhouse, so as to make such\nan arrangement desirable!--The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr.\nWoodhouse had been always felt in her husband's plans and her own, for\na marriage between Frank and Emma. How to settle the claims of Enscombe\nand Hartfield had been a continual impediment--less acknowledged by Mr.\nWeston than by herself--but even he had never been able to finish\nthe subject better than by saying--“Those matters will take care of\nthemselves; the young people will find a way.” But here there was\nnothing to be shifted off in a wild speculation on the future. It was\nall right, all open, all equal. No sacrifice on any side worth the name.\nIt was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself, and without\none real, rational difficulty to oppose or delay it.\n\nMrs. Weston, with her baby on her knee, indulging in such reflections\nas these, was one of the happiest women in the world. If any thing could\nincrease her delight, it was perceiving that the baby would soon have\noutgrown its first set of caps.\n\nThe news was universally a surprize wherever it spread; and Mr. Weston\nhad his five minutes share of it; but five minutes were enough to\nfamiliarise the idea to his quickness of mind.--He saw the advantages\nof the match, and rejoiced in them with all the constancy of his wife;\nbut the wonder of it was very soon nothing; and by the end of an hour he\nwas not far from believing that he had always foreseen it.\n\n“It is to be a secret, I conclude,” said he. “These matters are always a\nsecret, till it is found out that every body knows them. Only let me be\ntold when I may speak out.--I wonder whether Jane has any suspicion.”\n\nHe went to Highbury the next morning, and satisfied himself on that\npoint. He told her the news. Was not she like a daughter, his eldest\ndaughter?--he must tell her; and Miss Bates being present, it passed,\nof course, to Mrs. Cole, Mrs. Perry, and Mrs. Elton, immediately\nafterwards. It was no more than the principals were prepared for; they\nhad calculated from the time of its being known at Randalls, how soon it\nwould be over Highbury; and were thinking of themselves, as the evening\nwonder in many a family circle, with great sagacity.\n\nIn general, it was a very well approved match. Some might think him, and\nothers might think her, the most in luck. One set might recommend their\nall removing to Donwell, and leaving Hartfield for the John Knightleys;\nand another might predict disagreements among their servants; but yet,\nupon the whole, there was no serious objection raised, except in one\nhabitation, the Vicarage.--There, the surprize was not softened by any\nsatisfaction. Mr. Elton cared little about it, compared with his wife;\nhe only hoped “the young lady's pride would now be contented;” and\nsupposed “she had always meant to catch Knightley if she could;” and,\non the point of living at Hartfield, could daringly exclaim, “Rather\nhe than I!”--But Mrs. Elton was very much discomposed indeed.--“Poor\nKnightley! poor fellow!--sad business for him.”--She was extremely\nconcerned; for, though very eccentric, he had a thousand good\nqualities.--How could he be so taken in?--Did not think him at all in\nlove--not in the least.--Poor Knightley!--There would be an end of all\npleasant intercourse with him.--How happy he had been to come and dine\nwith them whenever they asked him! But that would be all over now.--Poor\nfellow!--No more exploring parties to Donwell made for _her_. Oh!\nno; there would be a Mrs. Knightley to throw cold water on every\nthing.--Extremely disagreeable! But she was not at all sorry that\nshe had abused the housekeeper the other day.--Shocking plan, living\ntogether. It would never do. She knew a family near Maple Grove who\nhad tried it, and been obliged to separate before the end of the first\nquarter.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n\nTime passed on. A few more to-morrows, and the party from London would\nbe arriving. It was an alarming change; and Emma was thinking of it one\nmorning, as what must bring a great deal to agitate and grieve her, when\nMr. Knightley came in, and distressing thoughts were put by. After the\nfirst chat of pleasure he was silent; and then, in a graver tone, began\nwith,\n\n“I have something to tell you, Emma; some news.”\n\n“Good or bad?” said she, quickly, looking up in his face.\n\n“I do not know which it ought to be called.”\n\n“Oh! good I am sure.--I see it in your countenance. You are trying not\nto smile.”\n\n“I am afraid,” said he, composing his features, “I am very much afraid,\nmy dear Emma, that you will not smile when you hear it.”\n\n“Indeed! but why so?--I can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases\nor amuses you, should not please and amuse me too.”\n\n“There is one subject,” he replied, “I hope but one, on which we do not\nthink alike.” He paused a moment, again smiling, with his eyes fixed on\nher face. “Does nothing occur to you?--Do not you recollect?--Harriet\nSmith.”\n\nHer cheeks flushed at the name, and she felt afraid of something, though\nshe knew not what.\n\n“Have you heard from her yourself this morning?” cried he. “You have, I\nbelieve, and know the whole.”\n\n“No, I have not; I know nothing; pray tell me.”\n\n“You are prepared for the worst, I see--and very bad it is. Harriet\nSmith marries Robert Martin.”\n\nEmma gave a start, which did not seem like being prepared--and her eyes,\nin eager gaze, said, “No, this is impossible!” but her lips were closed.\n\n“It is so, indeed,” continued Mr. Knightley; “I have it from Robert\nMartin himself. He left me not half an hour ago.”\n\nShe was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement.\n\n“You like it, my Emma, as little as I feared.--I wish our opinions were\nthe same. But in time they will. Time, you may be sure, will make one\nor the other of us think differently; and, in the meanwhile, we need not\ntalk much on the subject.”\n\n“You mistake me, you quite mistake me,” she replied, exerting herself.\n“It is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy, but I\ncannot believe it. It seems an impossibility!--You cannot mean to say,\nthat Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin. You cannot mean that he\nhas even proposed to her again--yet. You only mean, that he intends it.”\n\n“I mean that he has done it,” answered Mr. Knightley, with smiling but\ndetermined decision, “and been accepted.”\n\n“Good God!” she cried.--“Well!”--Then having recourse to her workbasket,\nin excuse for leaning down her face, and concealing all the exquisite\nfeelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she must be\nexpressing, she added, “Well, now tell me every thing; make this\nintelligible to me. How, where, when?--Let me know it all. I never was\nmore surprized--but it does not make me unhappy, I assure you.--How--how\nhas it been possible?”\n\n“It is a very simple story. He went to town on business three days ago,\nand I got him to take charge of some papers which I was wanting to send\nto John.--He delivered these papers to John, at his chambers, and was\nasked by him to join their party the same evening to Astley's. They were\ngoing to take the two eldest boys to Astley's. The party was to be our\nbrother and sister, Henry, John--and Miss Smith. My friend Robert could\nnot resist. They called for him in their way; were all extremely amused;\nand my brother asked him to dine with them the next day--which he\ndid--and in the course of that visit (as I understand) he found an\nopportunity of speaking to Harriet; and certainly did not speak\nin vain.--She made him, by her acceptance, as happy even as he is\ndeserving. He came down by yesterday's coach, and was with me this\nmorning immediately after breakfast, to report his proceedings, first\non my affairs, and then on his own. This is all that I can relate of\nthe how, where, and when. Your friend Harriet will make a much\nlonger history when you see her.--She will give you all the minute\nparticulars, which only woman's language can make interesting.--In our\ncommunications we deal only in the great.--However, I must say, that\nRobert Martin's heart seemed for _him_, and to _me_, very overflowing;\nand that he did mention, without its being much to the purpose, that\non quitting their box at Astley's, my brother took charge of Mrs. John\nKnightley and little John, and he followed with Miss Smith and Henry;\nand that at one time they were in such a crowd, as to make Miss Smith\nrather uneasy.”\n\nHe stopped.--Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply. To speak, she\nwas sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness.\nShe must wait a moment, or he would think her mad. Her silence disturbed\nhim; and after observing her a little while, he added,\n\n“Emma, my love, you said that this circumstance would not now make you\nunhappy; but I am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected. His\nsituation is an evil--but you must consider it as what satisfies your\nfriend; and I will answer for your thinking better and better of him\nas you know him more. His good sense and good principles would delight\nyou.--As far as the man is concerned, you could not wish your friend\nin better hands. His rank in society I would alter if I could, which is\nsaying a great deal I assure you, Emma.--You laugh at me about William\nLarkins; but I could quite as ill spare Robert Martin.”\n\nHe wanted her to look up and smile; and having now brought herself not\nto smile too broadly--she did--cheerfully answering,\n\n“You need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match. I think\nHarriet is doing extremely well. _Her_ connexions may be worse than\n_his_. In respectability of character, there can be no doubt that they\nare. I have been silent from surprize merely, excessive surprize. You\ncannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me! how peculiarly unprepared\nI was!--for I had reason to believe her very lately more determined\nagainst him, much more, than she was before.”\n\n“You ought to know your friend best,” replied Mr. Knightley; “but I\nshould say she was a good-tempered, soft-hearted girl, not likely to be\nvery, very determined against any young man who told her he loved her.”\n\nEmma could not help laughing as she answered, “Upon my word, I believe\nyou know her quite as well as I do.--But, Mr. Knightley, are you\nperfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright _accepted_ him.\nI could suppose she might in time--but can she already?--Did not you\nmisunderstand him?--You were both talking of other things; of business,\nshows of cattle, or new drills--and might not you, in the confusion of\nso many subjects, mistake him?--It was not Harriet's hand that he was\ncertain of--it was the dimensions of some famous ox.”\n\nThe contrast between the countenance and air of Mr. Knightley and Robert\nMartin was, at this moment, so strong to Emma's feelings, and so strong\nwas the recollection of all that had so recently passed on Harriet's\nside, so fresh the sound of those words, spoken with such emphasis,\n“No, I hope I know better than to think of Robert Martin,” that she was\nreally expecting the intelligence to prove, in some measure, premature.\nIt could not be otherwise.\n\n“Do you dare say this?” cried Mr. Knightley. “Do you dare to suppose me\nso great a blockhead, as not to know what a man is talking of?--What do\nyou deserve?”\n\n“Oh! I always deserve the best treatment, because I never put up with\nany other; and, therefore, you must give me a plain, direct answer. Are\nyou quite sure that you understand the terms on which Mr. Martin and\nHarriet now are?”\n\n“I am quite sure,” he replied, speaking very distinctly, “that he\ntold me she had accepted him; and that there was no obscurity, nothing\ndoubtful, in the words he used; and I think I can give you a proof that\nit must be so. He asked my opinion as to what he was now to do. He knew\nof no one but Mrs. Goddard to whom he could apply for information of\nher relations or friends. Could I mention any thing more fit to be done,\nthan to go to Mrs. Goddard? I assured him that I could not. Then, he\nsaid, he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day.”\n\n“I am perfectly satisfied,” replied Emma, with the brightest smiles,\n“and most sincerely wish them happy.”\n\n“You are materially changed since we talked on this subject before.”\n\n“I hope so--for at that time I was a fool.”\n\n“And I am changed also; for I am now very willing to grant you all\nHarriet's good qualities. I have taken some pains for your sake, and for\nRobert Martin's sake, (whom I have always had reason to believe as much\nin love with her as ever,) to get acquainted with her. I have often\ntalked to her a good deal. You must have seen that I did. Sometimes,\nindeed, I have thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor\nMartin's cause, which was never the case; but, from all my observations,\nI am convinced of her being an artless, amiable girl, with very good\nnotions, very seriously good principles, and placing her happiness in\nthe affections and utility of domestic life.--Much of this, I have no\ndoubt, she may thank you for.”\n\n“Me!” cried Emma, shaking her head.--“Ah! poor Harriet!”\n\nShe checked herself, however, and submitted quietly to a little more\npraise than she deserved.\n\nTheir conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of her\nfather. She was not sorry. She wanted to be alone. Her mind was in a\nstate of flutter and wonder, which made it impossible for her to be\ncollected. She was in dancing, singing, exclaiming spirits; and till she\nhad moved about, and talked to herself, and laughed and reflected, she\ncould be fit for nothing rational.\n\nHer father's business was to announce James's being gone out to put the\nhorses to, preparatory to their now daily drive to Randalls; and she\nhad, therefore, an immediate excuse for disappearing.\n\nThe joy, the gratitude, the exquisite delight of her sensations may be\nimagined. The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of\nHarriet's welfare, she was really in danger of becoming too happy for\nsecurity.--What had she to wish for? Nothing, but to grow more worthy of\nhim, whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her own.\nNothing, but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her humility\nand circumspection in future.\n\nSerious she was, very serious in her thankfulness, and in her\nresolutions; and yet there was no preventing a laugh, sometimes in the\nvery midst of them. She must laugh at such a close! Such an end of the\ndoleful disappointment of five weeks back! Such a heart--such a Harriet!\n\nNow there would be pleasure in her returning--Every thing would be a\npleasure. It would be a great pleasure to know Robert Martin.\n\nHigh in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities, was the\nreflection that all necessity of concealment from Mr. Knightley would\nsoon be over. The disguise, equivocation, mystery, so hateful to her to\npractise, might soon be over. She could now look forward to giving him\nthat full and perfect confidence which her disposition was most ready to\nwelcome as a duty.\n\nIn the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father; not\nalways listening, but always agreeing to what he said; and, whether in\nspeech or silence, conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his\nbeing obliged to go to Randalls every day, or poor Mrs. Weston would be\ndisappointed.\n\nThey arrived.--Mrs. Weston was alone in the drawing-room:--but hardly\nhad they been told of the baby, and Mr. Woodhouse received the thanks\nfor coming, which he asked for, when a glimpse was caught through the\nblind, of two figures passing near the window.\n\n“It is Frank and Miss Fairfax,” said Mrs. Weston. “I was just going to\ntell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive this morning. He\nstays till to-morrow, and Miss Fairfax has been persuaded to spend the\nday with us.--They are coming in, I hope.”\n\nIn half a minute they were in the room. Emma was extremely glad to\nsee him--but there was a degree of confusion--a number of embarrassing\nrecollections on each side. They met readily and smiling, but with a\nconsciousness which at first allowed little to be said; and having all\nsat down again, there was for some time such a blank in the circle, that\nEmma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged, which she had long\nfelt, of seeing Frank Churchill once more, and of seeing him with Jane,\nwould yield its proportion of pleasure. When Mr. Weston joined the\nparty, however, and when the baby was fetched, there was no longer a\nwant of subject or animation--or of courage and opportunity for Frank\nChurchill to draw near her and say,\n\n“I have to thank you, Miss Woodhouse, for a very kind forgiving message\nin one of Mrs. Weston's letters. I hope time has not made you less\nwilling to pardon. I hope you do not retract what you then said.”\n\n“No, indeed,” cried Emma, most happy to begin, “not in the least. I am\nparticularly glad to see and shake hands with you--and to give you joy\nin person.”\n\nHe thanked her with all his heart, and continued some time to speak with\nserious feeling of his gratitude and happiness.\n\n“Is not she looking well?” said he, turning his eyes towards Jane.\n“Better than she ever used to do?--You see how my father and Mrs. Weston\ndoat upon her.”\n\nBut his spirits were soon rising again, and with laughing eyes, after\nmentioning the expected return of the Campbells, he named the name of\nDixon.--Emma blushed, and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing.\n\n“I can never think of it,” she cried, “without extreme shame.”\n\n“The shame,” he answered, “is all mine, or ought to be. But is it\npossible that you had no suspicion?--I mean of late. Early, I know, you\nhad none.”\n\n“I never had the smallest, I assure you.”\n\n“That appears quite wonderful. I was once very near--and I wish I\nhad--it would have been better. But though I was always doing wrong\nthings, they were very bad wrong things, and such as did me no\nservice.--It would have been a much better transgression had I broken\nthe bond of secrecy and told you every thing.”\n\n“It is not now worth a regret,” said Emma.\n\n“I have some hope,” resumed he, “of my uncle's being persuaded to pay a\nvisit at Randalls; he wants to be introduced to her. When the Campbells\nare returned, we shall meet them in London, and continue there, I trust,\ntill we may carry her northward.--But now, I am at such a distance from\nher--is not it hard, Miss Woodhouse?--Till this morning, we have not\nonce met since the day of reconciliation. Do not you pity me?”\n\nEmma spoke her pity so very kindly, that with a sudden accession of gay\nthought, he cried,\n\n“Ah! by the bye,” then sinking his voice, and looking demure for the\nmoment--“I hope Mr. Knightley is well?” He paused.--She coloured and\nlaughed.--“I know you saw my letter, and think you may remember my wish\nin your favour. Let me return your congratulations.--I assure you that\nI have heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfaction.--He is\na man whom I cannot presume to praise.”\n\nEmma was delighted, and only wanted him to go on in the same style; but\nhis mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his own Jane,\nand his next words were,\n\n“Did you ever see such a skin?--such smoothness! such delicacy!--and\nyet without being actually fair.--One cannot call her fair. It is a\nmost uncommon complexion, with her dark eye-lashes and hair--a most\ndistinguishing complexion! So peculiarly the lady in it.--Just colour\nenough for beauty.”\n\n“I have always admired her complexion,” replied Emma, archly; “but\ndo not I remember the time when you found fault with her for being so\npale?--When we first began to talk of her.--Have you quite forgotten?”\n\n“Oh! no--what an impudent dog I was!--How could I dare--”\n\nBut he laughed so heartily at the recollection, that Emma could not help\nsaying,\n\n“I do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time, you\nhad very great amusement in tricking us all.--I am sure you had.--I am\nsure it was a consolation to you.”\n\n“Oh! no, no, no--how can you suspect me of such a thing? I was the most\nmiserable wretch!”\n\n“Not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth. I am sure it was a\nsource of high entertainment to you, to feel that you were taking us\nall in.--Perhaps I am the readier to suspect, because, to tell you the\ntruth, I think it might have been some amusement to myself in the same\nsituation. I think there is a little likeness between us.”\n\nHe bowed.\n\n“If not in our dispositions,” she presently added, with a look of true\nsensibility, “there is a likeness in our destiny; the destiny which bids\nfair to connect us with two characters so much superior to our own.”\n\n“True, true,” he answered, warmly. “No, not true on your side. You can\nhave no superior, but most true on mine.--She is a complete angel. Look\nat her. Is not she an angel in every gesture? Observe the turn of her\nthroat. Observe her eyes, as she is looking up at my father.--You will\nbe glad to hear (inclining his head, and whispering seriously) that my\nuncle means to give her all my aunt's jewels. They are to be new set.\nI am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head. Will not it be\nbeautiful in her dark hair?”\n\n“Very beautiful, indeed,” replied Emma; and she spoke so kindly, that he\ngratefully burst out,\n\n“How delighted I am to see you again! and to see you in such excellent\nlooks!--I would not have missed this meeting for the world. I should\ncertainly have called at Hartfield, had you failed to come.”\n\nThe others had been talking of the child, Mrs. Weston giving an account\nof a little alarm she had been under, the evening before, from the\ninfant's appearing not quite well. She believed she had been foolish,\nbut it had alarmed her, and she had been within half a minute of sending\nfor Mr. Perry. Perhaps she ought to be ashamed, but Mr. Weston had been\nalmost as uneasy as herself.--In ten minutes, however, the child had\nbeen perfectly well again. This was her history; and particularly\ninteresting it was to Mr. Woodhouse, who commended her very much for\nthinking of sending for Perry, and only regretted that she had not done\nit. “She should always send for Perry, if the child appeared in the\nslightest degree disordered, were it only for a moment. She could not be\ntoo soon alarmed, nor send for Perry too often. It was a pity, perhaps,\nthat he had not come last night; for, though the child seemed well now,\nvery well considering, it would probably have been better if Perry had\nseen it.”\n\nFrank Churchill caught the name.\n\n“Perry!” said he to Emma, and trying, as he spoke, to catch Miss\nFairfax's eye. “My friend Mr. Perry! What are they saying about Mr.\nPerry?--Has he been here this morning?--And how does he travel now?--Has\nhe set up his carriage?”\n\nEmma soon recollected, and understood him; and while she joined in the\nlaugh, it was evident from Jane's countenance that she too was really\nhearing him, though trying to seem deaf.\n\n“Such an extraordinary dream of mine!” he cried. “I can never think of\nit without laughing.--She hears us, she hears us, Miss Woodhouse. I see\nit in her cheek, her smile, her vain attempt to frown. Look at her. Do\nnot you see that, at this instant, the very passage of her own letter,\nwhich sent me the report, is passing under her eye--that the whole\nblunder is spread before her--that she can attend to nothing else,\nthough pretending to listen to the others?”\n\nJane was forced to smile completely, for a moment; and the smile partly\nremained as she turned towards him, and said in a conscious, low, yet\nsteady voice,\n\n“How you can bear such recollections, is astonishing to me!--They\n_will_ sometimes obtrude--but how you can court them!”\n\nHe had a great deal to say in return, and very entertainingly; but\nEmma's feelings were chiefly with Jane, in the argument; and on leaving\nRandalls, and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men, she\nfelt, that pleased as she had been to see Frank Churchill, and really\nregarding him as she did with friendship, she had never been more\nsensible of Mr. Knightley's high superiority of character. The happiness\nof this most happy day, received its completion, in the animated\ncontemplation of his worth which this comparison produced.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\n\nIf Emma had still, at intervals, an anxious feeling for Harriet, a\nmomentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured of her\nattachment to Mr. Knightley, and really able to accept another man from\nunbiased inclination, it was not long that she had to suffer from the\nrecurrence of any such uncertainty. A very few days brought the party\nfrom London, and she had no sooner an opportunity of being one hour\nalone with Harriet, than she became perfectly satisfied--unaccountable\nas it was!--that Robert Martin had thoroughly supplanted Mr. Knightley,\nand was now forming all her views of happiness.\n\nHarriet was a little distressed--did look a little foolish at first:\nbut having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly, and\nself-deceived, before, her pain and confusion seemed to die away with\nthe words, and leave her without a care for the past, and with the\nfullest exultation in the present and future; for, as to her friend's\napprobation, Emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature, by\nmeeting her with the most unqualified congratulations.--Harriet was\nmost happy to give every particular of the evening at Astley's, and the\ndinner the next day; she could dwell on it all with the utmost delight.\nBut what did such particulars explain?--The fact was, as Emma could now\nacknowledge, that Harriet had always liked Robert Martin; and that his\ncontinuing to love her had been irresistible.--Beyond this, it must ever\nbe unintelligible to Emma.\n\nThe event, however, was most joyful; and every day was giving her fresh\nreason for thinking so.--Harriet's parentage became known. She proved\nto be the daughter of a tradesman, rich enough to afford her the\ncomfortable maintenance which had ever been hers, and decent enough to\nhave always wished for concealment.--Such was the blood of gentility\nwhich Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for!--It was likely to\nbe as untainted, perhaps, as the blood of many a gentleman: but what\na connexion had she been preparing for Mr. Knightley--or for the\nChurchills--or even for Mr. Elton!--The stain of illegitimacy,\nunbleached by nobility or wealth, would have been a stain indeed.\n\nNo objection was raised on the father's side; the young man was treated\nliberally; it was all as it should be: and as Emma became acquainted\nwith Robert Martin, who was now introduced at Hartfield, she fully\nacknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth which could\nbid fairest for her little friend. She had no doubt of Harriet's\nhappiness with any good-tempered man; but with him, and in the home he\noffered, there would be the hope of more, of security, stability, and\nimprovement. She would be placed in the midst of those who loved her,\nand who had better sense than herself; retired enough for safety,\nand occupied enough for cheerfulness. She would be never led into\ntemptation, nor left for it to find her out. She would be respectable\nand happy; and Emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in the\nworld, to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such a\nman;--or, if not quite the luckiest, to yield only to herself.\n\nHarriet, necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the Martins,\nwas less and less at Hartfield; which was not to be regretted.--The\nintimacy between her and Emma must sink; their friendship must change\ninto a calmer sort of goodwill; and, fortunately, what ought to be,\nand must be, seemed already beginning, and in the most gradual, natural\nmanner.\n\nBefore the end of September, Emma attended Harriet to church, and saw\nher hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction, as\nno remembrances, even connected with Mr. Elton as he stood before them,\ncould impair.--Perhaps, indeed, at that time she scarcely saw Mr. Elton,\nbut as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on\nherself.--Robert Martin and Harriet Smith, the latest couple engaged of\nthe three, were the first to be married.\n\nJane Fairfax had already quitted Highbury, and was restored to the\ncomforts of her beloved home with the Campbells.--The Mr. Churchills\nwere also in town; and they were only waiting for November.\n\nThe intermediate month was the one fixed on, as far as they dared, by\nEmma and Mr. Knightley.--They had determined that their marriage ought\nto be concluded while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield, to\nallow them the fortnight's absence in a tour to the seaside, which was\nthe plan.--John and Isabella, and every other friend, were agreed in\napproving it. But Mr. Woodhouse--how was Mr. Woodhouse to be induced\nto consent?--he, who had never yet alluded to their marriage but as a\ndistant event.\n\nWhen first sounded on the subject, he was so miserable, that they were\nalmost hopeless.--A second allusion, indeed, gave less pain.--He\nbegan to think it was to be, and that he could not prevent it--a very\npromising step of the mind on its way to resignation. Still, however, he\nwas not happy. Nay, he appeared so much otherwise, that his daughter's\ncourage failed. She could not bear to see him suffering, to know\nhim fancying himself neglected; and though her understanding almost\nacquiesced in the assurance of both the Mr. Knightleys, that when\nonce the event were over, his distress would be soon over too, she\nhesitated--she could not proceed.\n\nIn this state of suspense they were befriended, not by any sudden\nillumination of Mr. Woodhouse's mind, or any wonderful change of his\nnervous system, but by the operation of the same system in another\nway.--Mrs. Weston's poultry-house was robbed one night of all her\nturkeys--evidently by the ingenuity of man. Other poultry-yards in\nthe neighbourhood also suffered.--Pilfering was _housebreaking_ to Mr.\nWoodhouse's fears.--He was very uneasy; and but for the sense of his\nson-in-law's protection, would have been under wretched alarm every\nnight of his life. The strength, resolution, and presence of mind of the\nMr. Knightleys, commanded his fullest dependence. While either of them\nprotected him and his, Hartfield was safe.--But Mr. John Knightley must\nbe in London again by the end of the first week in November.\n\nThe result of this distress was, that, with a much more voluntary,\ncheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the\nmoment, she was able to fix her wedding-day--and Mr. Elton was called\non, within a month from the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Martin, to\njoin the hands of Mr. Knightley and Miss Woodhouse.\n\nThe wedding was very much like other weddings, where the parties have\nno taste for finery or parade; and Mrs. Elton, from the particulars\ndetailed by her husband, thought it all extremely shabby, and very\ninferior to her own.--“Very little white satin, very few lace veils; a\nmost pitiful business!--Selina would stare when she heard of it.”--But,\nin spite of these deficiencies, the wishes, the hopes, the confidence,\nthe predictions of the small band of true friends who witnessed the\nceremony, were fully answered in the perfect happiness of the union.\n\n\n\nFINIS",
