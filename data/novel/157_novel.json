 "text": "DADDY-LONG-LEGS\n\n\nby\n\nJEAN WEBSTER\n\n\n\nCopyright 1912 by The Century Company\n\n\n\n\nTO YOU\n\n\n\n\nBlue Wednesday\n\nThe first Wednesday in every month was a Perfectly Awful Day--a day to\nbe awaited with dread, endured with courage and forgotten with haste.\nEvery floor must be spotless, every chair dustless, and every bed\nwithout a wrinkle.  Ninety-seven squirming little orphans must be\nscrubbed and combed and buttoned into freshly starched ginghams; and\nall ninety-seven reminded of their manners, and told to say, 'Yes,\nsir,' 'No, sir,' whenever a Trustee spoke.\n\nIt was a distressing time; and poor Jerusha Abbott, being the oldest\norphan, had to bear the brunt of it.  But this particular first\nWednesday, like its predecessors, finally dragged itself to a close.\nJerusha escaped from the pantry where she had been making sandwiches\nfor the asylum's guests, and turned upstairs to accomplish her regular\nwork.  Her special care was room F, where eleven little tots, from four\nto seven, occupied eleven little cots set in a row.  Jerusha assembled\nher charges, straightened their rumpled frocks, wiped their noses, and\nstarted them in an orderly and willing line towards the dining-room to\nengage themselves for a blessed half hour with bread and milk and prune\npudding.\n\nThen she dropped down on the window seat and leaned throbbing temples\nagainst the cool glass.  She had been on her feet since five that\nmorning, doing everybody's bidding, scolded and hurried by a nervous\nmatron.  Mrs. Lippett, behind the scenes, did not always maintain that\ncalm and pompous dignity with which she faced an audience of Trustees\nand lady visitors.  Jerusha gazed out across a broad stretch of frozen\nlawn, beyond the tall iron paling that marked the confines of the\nasylum, down undulating ridges sprinkled with country estates, to the\nspires of the village rising from the midst of bare trees.\n\nThe day was ended--quite successfully, so far as she knew.  The\nTrustees and the visiting committee had made their rounds, and read\ntheir reports, and drunk their tea, and now were hurrying home to their\nown cheerful firesides, to forget their bothersome little charges for\nanother month.  Jerusha leaned forward watching with curiosity--and a\ntouch of wistfulness--the stream of carriages and automobiles that\nrolled out of the asylum gates.  In imagination she followed first one\nequipage, then another, to the big houses dotted along the hillside.\nShe pictured herself in a fur coat and a velvet hat trimmed with\nfeathers leaning back in the seat and nonchalantly murmuring 'Home' to\nthe driver.  But on the door-sill of her home the picture grew blurred.\n\nJerusha had an imagination--an imagination, Mrs. Lippett told her, that\nwould get her into trouble if she didn't take care--but keen as it was,\nit could not carry her beyond the front porch of the houses she would\nenter.  Poor, eager, adventurous little Jerusha, in all her seventeen\nyears, had never stepped inside an ordinary house; she could not\npicture the daily routine of those other human beings who carried on\ntheir lives undiscommoded by orphans.\n\n                   Je-ru-sha Ab-bott\n                   You are wan-ted\n                   In the of-fice,\n                   And I think you'd\n                   Better hurry up!\n\n\nTommy Dillon, who had joined the choir, came singing up the stairs and\ndown the corridor, his chant growing louder as he approached room F.\nJerusha wrenched herself from the window and refaced the troubles of\nlife.\n\n'Who wants me?' she cut into Tommy's chant with a note of sharp anxiety.\n\n               Mrs. Lippett in the office,\n               And I think she's mad.\n                      Ah-a-men!\n\n\nTommy piously intoned, but his accent was not entirely malicious.  Even\nthe most hardened little orphan felt sympathy for an erring sister who\nwas summoned to the office to face an annoyed matron; and Tommy liked\nJerusha even if she did sometimes jerk him by the arm and nearly scrub\nhis nose off.\n\nJerusha went without comment, but with two parallel lines on her brow.\nWhat could have gone wrong, she wondered.  Were the sandwiches not thin\nenough?  Were there shells in the nut cakes?  Had a lady visitor seen\nthe hole in Susie Hawthorn's stocking?  Had--O horrors!--one of the\ncherubic little babes in her own room F 'sauced' a Trustee?\n\nThe long lower hall had not been lighted, and as she came downstairs, a\nlast Trustee stood, on the point of departure, in the open door that\nled to the porte-cochere. Jerusha caught only a fleeting impression of\nthe man--and the impression consisted entirely of tallness.  He was\nwaving his arm towards an automobile waiting in the curved drive.  As\nit sprang into motion and approached, head on for an instant, the\nglaring headlights threw his shadow sharply against the wall inside.\nThe shadow pictured grotesquely elongated legs and arms that ran along\nthe floor and up the wall of the corridor.  It looked, for all the\nworld, like a huge, wavering daddy-long-legs.\n\nJerusha's anxious frown gave place to quick laughter.  She was by\nnature a sunny soul, and had always snatched the tiniest excuse to be\namused.  If one could derive any sort of entertainment out of the\noppressive fact of a Trustee, it was something unexpected to the good.\nShe advanced to the office quite cheered by the tiny episode, and\npresented a smiling face to Mrs. Lippett.  To her surprise the matron\nwas also, if not exactly smiling, at least appreciably affable; she\nwore an expression almost as pleasant as the one she donned for\nvisitors.\n\n'Sit down, Jerusha, I have something to say to you.'  Jerusha dropped\ninto the nearest chair and waited with a touch of breathlessness.  An\nautomobile flashed past the window; Mrs. Lippett glanced after it.\n\n'Did you notice the gentleman who has just gone?'\n\n'I saw his back.'\n\n'He is one of our most affluential Trustees, and has given large sums\nof money towards the asylum's support.  I am not at liberty to mention\nhis name; he expressly stipulated that he was to remain unknown.'\n\nJerusha's eyes widened slightly; she was not accustomed to being\nsummoned to the office to discuss the eccentricities of Trustees with\nthe matron.\n\n'This gentleman has taken an interest in several of our boys.  You\nremember Charles Benton and Henry Freize?  They were both sent through\ncollege by Mr.--er--this Trustee, and both have repaid with hard work\nand success the money that was so generously expended.  Other payment\nthe gentleman does not wish.  Heretofore his philanthropies have been\ndirected solely towards the boys; I have never been able to interest\nhim in the slightest degree in any of the girls in the institution, no\nmatter how deserving.  He does not, I may tell you, care for girls.'\n\n'No, ma'am,' Jerusha murmured, since some reply seemed to be expected\nat this point.\n\n'To-day at the regular meeting, the question of your future was brought\nup.'\n\nMrs. Lippett allowed a moment of silence to fall, then resumed in a\nslow, placid manner extremely trying to her hearer's suddenly tightened\nnerves.\n\n'Usually, as you know, the children are not kept after they are\nsixteen, but an exception was made in your case.  You had finished our\nschool at fourteen, and having done so well in your studies--not\nalways, I must say, in your conduct--it was determined to let you go on\nin the village high school.  Now you are finishing that, and of course\nthe asylum cannot be responsible any longer for your support.  As it\nis, you have had two years more than most.'\n\nMrs. Lippett overlooked the fact that Jerusha had worked hard for her\nboard during those two years, that the convenience of the asylum had\ncome first and her education second; that on days like the present she\nwas kept at home to scrub.\n\n'As I say, the question of your future was brought up and your record\nwas discussed--thoroughly discussed.'\n\nMrs. Lippett brought accusing eyes to bear upon the prisoner in the\ndock, and the prisoner looked guilty because it seemed to be\nexpected--not because she could remember any strikingly black pages in\nher record.\n\n'Of course the usual disposition of one in your place would be to put\nyou in a position where you could begin to work, but you have done well\nin school in certain branches; it seems that your work in English has\neven been brilliant.  Miss Pritchard, who is on our visiting committee,\nis also on the school board; she has been talking with your rhetoric\nteacher, and made a speech in your favour.  She also read aloud an\nessay that you had written entitled, \"Blue Wednesday\".'\n\nJerusha's guilty expression this time was not assumed.\n\n'It seemed to me that you showed little gratitude in holding up to\nridicule the institution that has done so much for you.  Had you not\nmanaged to be funny I doubt if you would have been forgiven.  But\nfortunately for you, Mr.--, that is, the gentleman who has just\ngone--appears to have an immoderate sense of humour.  On the strength\nof that impertinent paper, he has offered to send you to college.'\n\n'To college?'  Jerusha's eyes grew big.  Mrs. Lippett nodded.\n\n'He waited to discuss the terms with me.  They are unusual.  The\ngentleman, I may say, is erratic.  He believes that you have\noriginality, and he is planning to educate you to become a writer.'\n\n'A writer?'  Jerusha's mind was numbed.  She could only repeat Mrs.\nLippett's words.\n\n'That is his wish.  Whether anything will come of it, the future will\nshow.  He is giving you a very liberal allowance, almost, for a girl\nwho has never had any experience in taking care of money, too liberal.\nBut he planned the matter in detail, and I did not feel free to make\nany suggestions.  You are to remain here through the summer, and Miss\nPritchard has kindly offered to superintend your outfit.  Your board\nand tuition will be paid directly to the college, and you will receive\nin addition during the four years you are there, an allowance of\nthirty-five dollars a month.  This will enable you to enter on the same\nstanding as the other students.  The money will be sent to you by the\ngentleman's private secretary once a month, and in return, you will\nwrite a letter of acknowledgment once a month.  That is--you are not to\nthank him for the money; he doesn't care to have that mentioned, but\nyou are to write a letter telling of the progress in your studies and\nthe details of your daily life.  Just such a letter as you would write\nto your parents if they were living.\n\n'These letters will be addressed to Mr. John Smith and will be sent in\ncare of the secretary.  The gentleman's name is not John Smith, but he\nprefers to remain unknown.  To you he will never be anything but John\nSmith.  His reason in requiring the letters is that he thinks nothing\nso fosters facility in literary expression as letter-writing. Since you\nhave no family with whom to correspond, he desires you to write in this\nway; also, he wishes to keep track of your progress.  He will never\nanswer your letters, nor in the slightest particular take any notice of\nthem.  He detests letter-writing and does not wish you to become a\nburden.  If any point should ever arise where an answer would seem to\nbe imperative--such as in the event of your being expelled, which I\ntrust will not occur--you may correspond with Mr. Griggs, his\nsecretary.  These monthly letters are absolutely obligatory on your\npart; they are the only payment that Mr. Smith requires, so you must be\nas punctilious in sending them as though it were a bill that you were\npaying.  I hope that they will always be respectful in tone and will\nreflect credit on your training.  You must remember that you are\nwriting to a Trustee of the John Grier Home.'\n\nJerusha's eyes longingly sought the door.  Her head was in a whirl of\nexcitement, and she wished only to escape from Mrs. Lippett's\nplatitudes and think.  She rose and took a tentative step backwards.\nMrs. Lippett detained her with a gesture; it was an oratorical\nopportunity not to be slighted.\n\n'I trust that you are properly grateful for this very rare good fortune\nthat has befallen you?  Not many girls in your position ever have such\nan opportunity to rise in the world.  You must always remember--'\n\n'I--yes, ma'am, thank you.  I think, if that's all, I must go and sew a\npatch on Freddie Perkins's trousers.'\n\nThe door closed behind her, and Mrs. Lippett watched it with dropped\njaw, her peroration in mid-air.\n\n\n\n\nThe Letters of\n\nMiss Jerusha Abbott\n\nto\n\nMr. Daddy-Long-Legs Smith\n\n\n                                   215 FERGUSSEN HALL\n                                           24th September\n\nDear Kind-Trustee-Who-Sends-Orphans-to-College,\n\nHere I am!  I travelled yesterday for four hours in a train.  It's a\nfunny sensation, isn't it?  I never rode in one before.\n\nCollege is the biggest, most bewildering place--I get lost whenever I\nleave my room.  I will write you a description later when I'm feeling\nless muddled; also I will tell you about my lessons.  Classes don't\nbegin until Monday morning, and this is Saturday night.  But I wanted\nto write a letter first just to get acquainted.\n\nIt seems queer to be writing letters to somebody you don't know.  It\nseems queer for me to be writing letters at all--I've never written\nmore than three or four in my life, so please overlook it if these are\nnot a model kind.\n\nBefore leaving yesterday morning, Mrs. Lippett and I had a very serious\ntalk.  She told me how to behave all the rest of my life, and\nespecially how to behave towards the kind gentleman who is doing so\nmuch for me.  I must take care to be Very Respectful.\n\nBut how can one be very respectful to a person who wishes to be called\nJohn Smith?  Why couldn't you have picked out a name with a little\npersonality?  I might as well write letters to Dear Hitching-Post or\nDear Clothes-Prop.\n\nI have been thinking about you a great deal this summer; having\nsomebody take an interest in me after all these years makes me feel as\nthough I had found a sort of family.  It seems as though I belonged to\nsomebody now, and it's a very comfortable sensation.  I must say,\nhowever, that when I think about you, my imagination has very little to\nwork upon.  There are just three things that I know:\n\nI. You are tall.\n\nII.  You are rich.\n\nIII.  You hate girls.\n\nI suppose I might call you Dear Mr. Girl-Hater. Only that's rather\ninsulting to me.  Or Dear Mr. Rich-Man, but that's insulting to you, as\nthough money were the only important thing about you.  Besides, being\nrich is such a very external quality.  Maybe you won't stay rich all\nyour life; lots of very clever men get smashed up in Wall Street.  But\nat least you will stay tall all your life!  So I've decided to call you\nDear Daddy-Long-Legs. I hope you won't mind.  It's just a private pet\nname we won't tell Mrs. Lippett.\n\nThe ten o'clock bell is going to ring in two minutes.  Our day is\ndivided into sections by bells.  We eat and sleep and study by bells.\nIt's very enlivening; I feel like a fire horse all of the time.  There\nit goes!  Lights out.  Good night.\n\nObserve with what precision I obey rules--due to my training in the\nJohn Grier Home.\n\n           Yours most respectfully,\n                                       Jerusha Abbott\n\n\n\n\nTo Mr. Daddy-Long-Legs Smith\n\n                                           1st October\n\nDear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\nI love college and I love you for sending me--I'm very, very happy, and\nso excited every moment of the time that I can scarcely sleep.  You\ncan't imagine how different it is from the John Grier Home.  I never\ndreamed there was such a place in the world.  I'm feeling sorry for\neverybody who isn't a girl and who can't come here; I am sure the\ncollege you attended when you were a boy couldn't have been so nice.\n\nMy room is up in a tower that used to be the contagious ward before\nthey built the new infirmary.  There are three other girls on the same\nfloor of the tower--a Senior who wears spectacles and is always asking\nus please to be a little more quiet, and two Freshmen named Sallie\nMcBride and Julia Rutledge Pendleton.  Sallie has red hair and a\nturn-up nose and is quite friendly; Julia comes from one of the first\nfamilies in New York and hasn't noticed me yet.  They room together and\nthe Senior and I have singles.  Usually Freshmen can't get singles;\nthey are very scarce, but I got one without even asking.  I suppose the\nregistrar didn't think it would be right to ask a properly brought-up\ngirl to room with a foundling.  You see there are advantages!\n\nMy room is on the north-west corner with two windows and a view.  After\nyou've lived in a ward for eighteen years with twenty room-mates, it is\nrestful to be alone.  This is the first chance I've ever had to get\nacquainted with Jerusha Abbott.  I think I'm going to like her.\n\nDo you think you are?\n\n\n                                           Tuesday\n\nThey are organizing the Freshman basket-ball team and there's just a\nchance that I shall get in it.  I'm little of course, but terribly\nquick and wiry and tough.  While the others are hopping about in the\nair, I can dodge under their feet and grab the ball.  It's loads of fun\npractising--out in the athletic field in the afternoon with the trees\nall red and yellow and the air full of the smell of burning leaves, and\neverybody laughing and shouting.  These are the happiest girls I ever\nsaw--and I am the happiest of all!\n\nI meant to write a long letter and tell you all the things I'm learning\n(Mrs. Lippett said you wanted to know), but 7th hour has just rung, and\nin ten minutes I'm due at the athletic field in gymnasium clothes.\nDon't you hope I'll get in the team?\n\n                               Yours always,\n                                           Jerusha Abbott\n\nPS. (9 o'clock.)\n\nSallie McBride just poked her head in at my door.  This is what she\nsaid:\n\n'I'm so homesick that I simply can't stand it.  Do you feel that way?'\n\nI smiled a little and said no; I thought I could pull through.  At\nleast homesickness is one disease that I've escaped!  I never heard of\nanybody being asylum-sick, did you?\n\n\n\n\n                                               10th October\n\nDear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\nDid you ever hear of Michael Angelo?\n\nHe was a famous artist who lived in Italy in the Middle Ages.\nEverybody in English Literature seemed to know about him, and the whole\nclass laughed because I thought he was an archangel.  He sounds like an\narchangel, doesn't he?  The trouble with college is that you are\nexpected to know such a lot of things you've never learned.  It's very\nembarrassing at times.  But now, when the girls talk about things that\nI never heard of, I just keep still and look them up in the\nencyclopedia.\n\nI made an awful mistake the first day.  Somebody mentioned Maurice\nMaeterlinck, and I asked if she was a Freshman.  That joke has gone all\nover college.  But anyway, I'm just as bright in class as any of the\nothers--and brighter than some of them!\n\nDo you care to know how I've furnished my room?  It's a symphony in\nbrown and yellow.  The wall was tinted buff, and I've bought yellow\ndenim curtains and cushions and a mahogany desk (second hand for three\ndollars) and a rattan chair and a brown rug with an ink spot in the\nmiddle.  I stand the chair over the spot.\n\nThe windows are up high; you can't look out from an ordinary seat.  But\nI unscrewed the looking-glass from the back of the bureau, upholstered\nthe top and moved it up against the window.  It's just the right height\nfor a window seat.  You pull out the drawers like steps and walk up.\nVery comfortable!\n\nSallie McBride helped me choose the things at the Senior auction.  She\nhas lived in a house all her life and knows about furnishing.  You\ncan't imagine what fun it is to shop and pay with a real five-dollar\nbill and get some change--when you've never had more than a few cents\nin your life.  I assure you, Daddy dear, I do appreciate that allowance.\n\nSallie is the most entertaining person in the world--and Julia Rutledge\nPendleton the least so.  It's queer what a mixture the registrar can\nmake in the matter of room-mates. Sallie thinks everything is\nfunny--even flunking--and Julia is bored at everything.  She never\nmakes the slightest effort to be amiable.  She believes that if you are\na Pendleton, that fact alone admits you to heaven without any further\nexamination.  Julia and I were born to be enemies.\n\nAnd now I suppose you've been waiting very impatiently to hear what I\nam learning?\n\nI. Latin:  Second Punic war.  Hannibal and his forces pitched camp at\nLake Trasimenus last night.  They prepared an ambuscade for the Romans,\nand a battle took place at the fourth watch this morning.  Romans in\nretreat.\n\nII.  French:  24 pages of the Three Musketeers and third conjugation,\nirregular verbs.\n\nIII.  Geometry:  Finished cylinders; now doing cones.\n\nIV.  English:  Studying exposition.  My style improves daily in\nclearness and brevity.\n\nV. Physiology:  Reached the digestive system.  Bile and the pancreas\nnext time.  Yours, on the way to being educated,\n\n                                       Jerusha Abbott\n\nPS.  I hope you never touch alcohol, Daddy?  It does dreadful things to\nyour liver.\n\n\n\n\n                                               Wednesday\n\nDear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\nI've changed my name.\n\nI'm still 'Jerusha' in the catalogue, but I'm 'Judy' everywhere else.\nIt's really too bad, isn't it, to have to give yourself the only pet\nname you ever had?  I didn't quite make up the Judy though.  That's\nwhat Freddy Perkins used to call me before he could talk plainly.\n\nI wish Mrs. Lippett would use a little more ingenuity about choosing\nbabies' names.  She gets the last names out of the telephone\nbook--you'll find Abbott on the first page--and she picks the Christian\nnames up anywhere; she got Jerusha from a tombstone.  I've always hated\nit; but I rather like Judy.  It's such a silly name.  It belongs to the\nkind of girl I'm not--a sweet little blue-eyed thing, petted and\nspoiled by all the family, who romps her way through life without any\ncares.  Wouldn't it be nice to be like that?  Whatever faults I may\nhave, no one can ever accuse me of having been spoiled by my family!\nBut it's great fun to pretend I've been.  In the future please always\naddress me as Judy.\n\nDo you want to know something?  I have three pairs of kid gloves.  I've\nhad kid mittens before from the Christmas tree, but never real kid\ngloves with five fingers.  I take them out and try them on every little\nwhile.  It's all I can do not to wear them to classes.\n\n(Dinner bell.  Goodbye.)\n\n\n\n\n                                               Friday\n\nWhat do you think, Daddy?  The English instructor said that my last\npaper shows an unusual amount of originality.  She did, truly.  Those\nwere her words.  It doesn't seem possible, does it, considering the\neighteen years of training that I've had?  The aim of the John Grier\nHome (as you doubtless know and heartily approve of) is to turn the\nninety-seven orphans into ninety-seven twins.\n\nThe unusual artistic ability which I exhibit was developed at an early\nage through drawing chalk pictures of Mrs. Lippett on the woodshed door.\n\nI hope that I don't hurt your feelings when I criticize the home of my\nyouth?  But you have the upper hand, you know, for if I become too\nimpertinent, you can always stop payment of your cheques.  That isn't a\nvery polite thing to say--but you can't expect me to have any manners;\na foundling asylum isn't a young ladies' finishing school.\n\nYou know, Daddy, it isn't the work that is going to be hard in college.\nIt's the play.  Half the time I don't know what the girls are talking\nabout; their jokes seem to relate to a past that every one but me has\nshared.  I'm a foreigner in the world and I don't understand the\nlanguage.  It's a miserable feeling.  I've had it all my life.  At the\nhigh school the girls would stand in groups and just look at me.  I was\nqueer and different and everybody knew it.  I could FEEL 'John Grier\nHome' written on my face.  And then a few charitable ones would make a\npoint of coming up and saying something polite.  I HATED EVERY ONE OF\nTHEM--the charitable ones most of all.\n\nNobody here knows that I was brought up in an asylum.  I told Sallie\nMcBride that my mother and father were dead, and that a kind old\ngentleman was sending me to college which is entirely true so far as it\ngoes.  I don't want you to think I am a coward, but I do want to be\nlike the other girls, and that Dreadful Home looming over my childhood\nis the one great big difference.  If I can turn my back on that and\nshut out the remembrance, I think, I might be just as desirable as any\nother girl.  I don't believe there's any real, underneath difference,\ndo you?\n\nAnyway, Sallie McBride likes me!\n\n                           Yours ever,\n                                       Judy Abbott\n                                           (Nee Jerusha.)\n\n\n\n\n                                           Saturday morning\n\nI've just been reading this letter over and it sounds pretty\nun-cheerful. But can't you guess that I have a special topic due Monday\nmorning and a review in geometry and a very sneezy cold?\n\n\n\n\n                                           Sunday\n\nI forgot to post this yesterday, so I will add an indignant postscript.\nWe had a bishop this morning, and WHAT DO YOU THINK HE SAID?\n\n'The most beneficent promise made us in the Bible is this, \"The poor ye\nhave always with you.\"  They were put here in order to keep us\ncharitable.'\n\nThe poor, please observe, being a sort of useful domestic animal.  If I\nhadn't grown into such a perfect lady, I should have gone up after\nservice and told him what I thought.\n\n\n\n\n                                           25th October\n\nDear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\nI'm in the basket-ball team and you ought to see the bruise on my left\nshoulder.  It's blue and mahogany with little streaks of orange.  Julia\nPendleton tried for the team, but she didn't get in.  Hooray!\n\nYou see what a mean disposition I have.\n\nCollege gets nicer and nicer.  I like the girls and the teachers and\nthe classes and the campus and the things to eat.  We have ice-cream\ntwice a week and we never have corn-meal mush.\n\nYou only wanted to hear from me once a month, didn't you?  And I've\nbeen peppering you with letters every few days!  But I've been so\nexcited about all these new adventures that I MUST talk to somebody;\nand you're the only one I know.  Please excuse my exuberance; I'll\nsettle pretty soon.  If my letters bore you, you can always toss them\ninto the wastebasket.  I promise not to write another till the middle\nof November.\n\n                   Yours most loquaciously,\n                                           Judy Abbott\n\n\n\n\n\n                                       15th November\n\nDear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\nListen to what I've learned to-day.\n\nThe area of the convex surface of the frustum of a regular pyramid is\nhalf the product of the sum of the perimeters of its bases by the\naltitude of either of its trapezoids.\n\nIt doesn't sound true, but it is--I can prove it!\n\nYou've never heard about my clothes, have you, Daddy?  Six dresses, all\nnew and beautiful and bought for me--not handed down from somebody\nbigger.  Perhaps you don't realize what a climax that marks in the\ncareer of an orphan?  You gave them to me, and I am very, very, VERY\nmuch obliged.  It's a fine thing to be educated--but nothing compared\nto the dizzying experience of owning six new dresses.  Miss Pritchard,\nwho is on the visiting committee, picked them out--not Mrs. Lippett,\nthank goodness.  I have an evening dress, pink mull over silk (I'm\nperfectly beautiful in that), and a blue church dress, and a dinner\ndress of red veiling with Oriental trimming (makes me look like a\nGipsy), and another of rose-coloured challis, and a grey street suit,\nand an every-day dress for classes.  That wouldn't be an awfully big\nwardrobe for Julia Rutledge Pendleton, perhaps, but for Jerusha\nAbbott--Oh, my!\n\nI suppose you're thinking now what a frivolous, shallow little beast\nshe is, and what a waste of money to educate a girl?\n\nBut, Daddy, if you'd been dressed in checked ginghams all your life,\nyou'd appreciate how I feel.  And when I started to the high school, I\nentered upon another period even worse than the checked ginghams.\n\nThe poor box.\n\nYou can't know how I dreaded appearing in school in those miserable\npoor-box dresses.  I was perfectly sure to be put down in class next to\nthe girl who first owned my dress, and she would whisper and giggle and\npoint it out to the others.  The bitterness of wearing your enemies'\ncast-off clothes eats into your soul.  If I wore silk stockings for the\nrest of my life, I don't believe I could obliterate the scar.\n\n                           LATEST WAR BULLETIN!\n\n                      News from the Scene of Action.\n\nAt the fourth watch on Thursday the 13th of November, Hannibal routed\nthe advance guard of the Romans and led the Carthaginian forces over\nthe mountains into the plains of Casilinum.  A cohort of light armed\nNumidians engaged the infantry of Quintus Fabius Maximus.  Two battles\nand light skirmishing.  Romans repulsed with heavy losses.\n\n                           I have the honour of being,\n                           Your special correspondent from the front,\n                                               J. Abbott\n\n\nPS. I know I'm not to expect any letters in return, and I've been\nwarned not to bother you with questions, but tell me, Daddy, just this\nonce--are you awfully old or just a little old?  And are you perfectly\nbald or just a little bald?  It is very difficult thinking about you in\nthe abstract like a theorem in geometry.\n\nGiven a tall rich man who hates girls, but is very generous to one\nquite impertinent girl, what does he look like?\n\nR.S.V.P.\n\n\n\n\n                                           19th December\n\nDear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\nYou never answered my question and it was very important.\n\n                               ARE YOU BALD?\n\n\nI have it planned exactly what you look like--very\nsatisfactorily--until I reach the top of your head, and then I AM\nstuck.  I can't decide whether you have white hair or black hair or\nsort of sprinkly grey hair or maybe none at all.\n\nHere is your portrait:\n\nBut the problem is, shall I add some hair?\n\nWould you like to know what colour your eyes are?  They're grey, and\nyour eyebrows stick out like a porch roof (beetling, they're called in\nnovels), and your mouth is a straight line with a tendency to turn down\nat the corners.  Oh, you see, I know!  You're a snappy old thing with a\ntemper.\n\n       (Chapel bell.)\n\n\n                                               9.45 p.m.\n\nI have a new unbreakable rule:  never, never to study at night no\nmatter how many written reviews are coming in the morning.  Instead, I\nread just plain books--I have to, you know, because there are eighteen\nblank years behind me.  You wouldn't believe, Daddy, what an abyss of\nignorance my mind is; I am just realizing the depths myself.  The\nthings that most girls with a properly assorted family and a home and\nfriends and a library know by absorption, I have never heard of.  For\nexample:\n\nI never read Mother Goose or David Copperfield or Ivanhoe or Cinderella\nor Blue Beard or Robinson Crusoe or Jane Eyre or Alice in Wonderland or\na word of Rudyard Kipling.  I didn't know that Henry the Eighth was\nmarried more than once or that Shelley was a poet.  I didn't know that\npeople used to be monkeys and that the Garden of Eden was a beautiful\nmyth.  I didn't know that R. L. S. stood for Robert Louis Stevenson or\nthat George Eliot was a lady.  I had never seen a picture of the 'Mona\nLisa' and (it's true but you won't believe it) I had never heard of\nSherlock Holmes.\n\nNow, I know all of these things and a lot of others besides, but you\ncan see how much I need to catch up.  And oh, but it's fun!  I look\nforward all day to evening, and then I put an 'engaged' on the door and\nget into my nice red bath robe and furry slippers and pile all the\ncushions behind me on the couch, and light the brass student lamp at my\nelbow, and read and read and read one book isn't enough.  I have four\ngoing at once.  Just now, they're Tennyson's poems and Vanity Fair and\nKipling's Plain Tales and--don't laugh--Little Women.  I find that I am\nthe only girl in college who wasn't brought up on Little Women.  I\nhaven't told anybody though (that WOULD stamp me as queer). I just\nquietly went and bought it with $1.12 of my last month's allowance; and\nthe next time somebody mentions pickled limes, I'll know what she is\ntalking about!\n\n(Ten o'clock bell.  This is a very interrupted letter.)\n\n\n                                               Saturday\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to report fresh explorations in the field of\ngeometry.  On Friday last we abandoned our former works in\nparallelopipeds and proceeded to truncated prisms.  We are finding the\nroad rough and very uphill.\n\n\n                                               Sunday\n\nThe Christmas holidays begin next week and the trunks are up.  The\ncorridors are so filled up that you can hardly get through, and\neverybody is so bubbling over with excitement that studying is getting\nleft out.  I'm going to have a beautiful time in vacation; there's\nanother Freshman who lives in Texas staying behind, and we are planning\nto take long walks and if there's any ice--learn to skate.  Then there\nis still the whole library to be read--and three empty weeks to do it\nin!\n\nGoodbye, Daddy, I hope that you are feeling as happy as I am.\n\n                               Yours ever,\n                                           Judy\n\nPS.  Don't forget to answer my question.  If you don't want the trouble\nof writing, have your secretary telegraph.  He can just say:\n\n                          Mr. Smith is quite bald,\n\n                                    or\n\n                           Mr. Smith is not bald,\n\n                                    or\n\n                         Mr. Smith has white hair.\n\n\nAnd you can deduct the twenty-five cents out of my allowance.\n\nGoodbye till January--and a merry Christmas!\n\n\n\n\n                                       Towards the end of\n                                       the Christmas vacation.\n                                       Exact date unknown\n\nDear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\nIs it snowing where you are?  All the world that I see from my tower is\ndraped in white and the flakes are coming down as big as pop-corns.\nIt's late afternoon--the sun is just setting (a cold yellow colour)\nbehind some colder violet hills, and I am up in my window seat using\nthe last light to write to you.\n\nYour five gold pieces were a surprise!  I'm not used to receiving\nChristmas presents.  You have already given me such lots of\nthings--everything I have, you know--that I don't quite feel that I\ndeserve extras.  But I like them just the same.  Do you want to know\nwhat I bought with my money?\n\nI. A silver watch in a leather case to wear on my wrist and get me to\nrecitations in time.\n\nII.  Matthew Arnold's poems.\n\nIII.  A hot water bottle.\n\nIV.  A steamer rug.  (My tower is cold.)\n\nV. Five hundred sheets of yellow manuscript paper.  (I'm going to\ncommence being an author pretty soon.)\n\nVI.  A dictionary of synonyms.  (To enlarge the author's vocabulary.)\n\nVII.  (I don't much like to confess this last item, but I will.) A pair\nof silk stockings.\n\nAnd now, Daddy, never say I don't tell all!\n\nIt was a very low motive, if you must know it, that prompted the silk\nstockings.  Julia Pendleton comes into my room to do geometry, and she\nsits cross-legged on the couch and wears silk stockings every night.\nBut just wait--as soon as she gets back from vacation I shall go in and\nsit on her couch in my silk stockings.  You see, Daddy, the miserable\ncreature that I am but at least I'm honest; and you knew already, from\nmy asylum record, that I wasn't perfect, didn't you?\n\nTo recapitulate (that's the way the English instructor begins every\nother sentence), I am very much obliged for my seven presents.  I'm\npretending to myself that they came in a box from my family in\nCalifornia.  The watch is from father, the rug from mother, the hot\nwater bottle from grandmother who is always worrying for fear I shall\ncatch cold in this climate--and the yellow paper from my little brother\nHarry.  My sister Isabel gave me the silk stockings, and Aunt Susan the\nMatthew Arnold poems; Uncle Harry (little Harry is named after him)\ngave me the dictionary.  He wanted to send chocolates, but I insisted\non synonyms.\n\nYou don't object, do you, to playing the part of a composite family?\n\nAnd now, shall I tell you about my vacation, or are you only interested\nin my education as such?  I hope you appreciate the delicate shade of\nmeaning in 'as such'. It is the latest addition to my vocabulary.\n\nThe girl from Texas is named Leonora Fenton.  (Almost as funny as\nJerusha, isn't it?) I like her, but not so much as Sallie McBride; I\nshall never like any one so much as Sallie--except you.  I must always\nlike you the best of all, because you're my whole family rolled into\none.  Leonora and I and two Sophomores have walked 'cross country every\npleasant day and explored the whole neighbourhood, dressed in short\nskirts and knit jackets and caps, and carrying shiny sticks to whack\nthings with.  Once we walked into town--four miles--and stopped at a\nrestaurant where the college girls go for dinner.  Broiled lobster (35\ncents), and for dessert, buckwheat cakes and maple syrup (15 cents).\nNourishing and cheap.\n\nIt was such a lark!  Especially for me, because it was so awfully\ndifferent from the asylum--I feel like an escaped convict every time I\nleave the campus.  Before I thought, I started to tell the others what\nan experience I was having.  The cat was almost out of the bag when I\ngrabbed it by its tail and pulled it back.  It's awfully hard for me\nnot to tell everything I know.  I'm a very confiding soul by nature; if\nI didn't have you to tell things to, I'd burst.\n\nWe had a molasses candy pull last Friday evening, given by the house\nmatron of Fergussen to the left-behinds in the other halls.  There were\ntwenty-two of us altogether, Freshmen and Sophomores and juniors and\nSeniors all united in amicable accord.  The kitchen is huge, with\ncopper pots and kettles hanging in rows on the stone wall--the littlest\ncasserole among them about the size of a wash boiler.  Four hundred\ngirls live in Fergussen.  The chef, in a white cap and apron, fetched\nout twenty-two other white caps and aprons--I can't imagine where he\ngot so many--and we all turned ourselves into cooks.\n\nIt was great fun, though I have seen better candy.  When it was finally\nfinished, and ourselves and the kitchen and the door-knobs all\nthoroughly sticky, we organized a procession and still in our caps and\naprons, each carrying a big fork or spoon or frying pan, we marched\nthrough the empty corridors to the officers' parlour, where\nhalf-a-dozen professors and instructors were passing a tranquil\nevening.  We serenaded them with college songs and offered\nrefreshments.  They accepted politely but dubiously.  We left them\nsucking chunks of molasses candy, sticky and speechless.\n\nSo you see, Daddy, my education progresses!\n\nDon't you really think that I ought to be an artist instead of an\nauthor?\n\nVacation will be over in two days and I shall be glad to see the girls\nagain.  My tower is just a trifle lonely; when nine people occupy a\nhouse that was built for four hundred, they do rattle around a bit.\n\nEleven pages--poor Daddy, you must be tired!  I meant this to be just a\nshort little thank-you note--but when I get started I seem to have a\nready pen.\n\nGoodbye, and thank you for thinking of me--I should be perfectly happy\nexcept for one little threatening cloud on the horizon.  Examinations\ncome in February.\n\n                                   Yours with love,\n                                                   Judy\n\nPS.  Maybe it isn't proper to send love?  If it isn't, please excuse.\nBut I must love somebody and there's only you and Mrs. Lippett to\nchoose between, so you see--you'll HAVE to put up with it, Daddy dear,\nbecause I can't love her.\n\n\n\n\n                                               On the Eve\n\nDear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\nYou should see the way this college is studying!  We've forgotten we\never had a vacation.  Fifty-seven irregular verbs have I introduced to\nmy brain in the past four days--I'm only hoping they'll stay till after\nexaminations.\n\nSome of the girls sell their text-books when they're through with them,\nbut I intend to keep mine.  Then after I've graduated I shall have my\nwhole education in a row in the bookcase, and when I need to use any\ndetail, I can turn to it without the slightest hesitation.  So much\neasier and more accurate than trying to keep it in your head.\n\nJulia Pendleton dropped in this evening to pay a social call, and\nstayed a solid hour.  She got started on the subject of family, and I\nCOULDN'T switch her off.  She wanted to know what my mother's maiden\nname was--did you ever hear such an impertinent question to ask of a\nperson from a foundling asylum?  I didn't have the courage to say I\ndidn't know, so I just miserably plumped on the first name I could\nthink of, and that was Montgomery.  Then she wanted to know whether I\nbelonged to the Massachusetts Montgomerys or the Virginia Montgomerys.\n\nHer mother was a Rutherford.  The family came over in the ark, and were\nconnected by marriage with Henry the VIII.  On her father's side they\ndate back further than Adam.  On the topmost branches of her family\ntree there's a superior breed of monkeys with very fine silky hair and\nextra long tails.\n\nI meant to write you a nice, cheerful, entertaining letter tonight, but\nI'm too sleepy--and scared.  The Freshman's lot is not a happy one.\n\n           Yours, about to be examined,\n                                            Judy Abbott\n\n\n\n\n                                               Sunday\n\nDearest Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\nI have some awful, awful, awful news to tell you, but I won't begin\nwith it; I'll try to get you in a good humour first.\n\nJerusha Abbott has commenced to be an author.  A poem entitled, 'From\nmy Tower', appears in the February Monthly--on the first page, which is\na very great honour for a Freshman.  My English instructor stopped me\non the way out from chapel last night, and said it was a charming piece\nof work except for the sixth line, which had too many feet.  I will\nsend you a copy in case you care to read it.\n\nLet me see if I can't think of something else pleasant--  Oh, yes!  I'm\nlearning to skate, and can glide about quite respectably all by myself.\nAlso I've learned how to slide down a rope from the roof of the\ngymnasium, and I can vault a bar three feet and six inches high--I hope\nshortly to pull up to four feet.\n\nWe had a very inspiring sermon this morning preached by the Bishop of\nAlabama.  His text was:  'Judge not that ye be not judged.' It was\nabout the necessity of overlooking mistakes in others, and not\ndiscouraging people by harsh judgments.  I wish you might have heard it.\n\nThis is the sunniest, most blinding winter afternoon, with icicles\ndripping from the fir trees and all the world bending under a weight of\nsnow--except me, and I'm bending under a weight of sorrow.\n\nNow for the news--courage, Judy!--you must tell.\n\nAre you SURELY in a good humour?  I failed in mathematics and Latin\nprose.  I am tutoring in them, and will take another examination next\nmonth.  I'm sorry if you're disappointed, but otherwise I don't care a\nbit because I've learned such a lot of things not mentioned in the\ncatalogue.  I've read seventeen novels and bushels of poetry--really\nnecessary novels like Vanity Fair and Richard Feverel and Alice in\nWonderland.  Also Emerson's Essays and Lockhart's Life of Scott and the\nfirst volume of Gibbon's Roman Empire and half of Benvenuto Cellini's\nLife--wasn't he entertaining?  He used to saunter out and casually kill\na man before breakfast.\n\nSo you see, Daddy, I'm much more intelligent than if I'd just stuck to\nLatin.  Will you forgive me this once if I promise never to fail again?\n\n                           Yours in sackcloth,\n                                                   Judy\n\n\n\n\nDear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\nThis is an extra letter in the middle of the month because I'm rather\nlonely tonight.  It's awfully stormy.  All the lights are out on the\ncampus, but I drank black coffee and I can't go to sleep.\n\nI had a supper party this evening consisting of Sallie and Julia and\nLeonora Fenton--and sardines and toasted muffins and salad and fudge\nand coffee.  Julia said she'd had a good time, but Sallie stayed to\nhelp wash the dishes.\n\n\nI might, very usefully, put some time on Latin tonight but, there's no\ndoubt about it, I'm a very languid Latin scholar.  We've finished Livy\nand De Senectute and are now engaged with De Amicitia (pronounced Damn\nIcitia).\n\nShould you mind, just for a little while, pretending you are my\ngrandmother?  Sallie has one and Julia and Leonora each two, and they\nwere all comparing them tonight.  I can't think of anything I'd rather\nhave; it's such a respectable relationship.  So, if you really don't\nobject--When I went into town yesterday, I saw the sweetest cap of\nCluny lace trimmed with lavender ribbon.  I am going to make you a\npresent of it on your eighty-third birthday.\n\n! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !\n\nThat's the clock in the chapel tower striking twelve.  I believe I am\nsleepy after all.\n\n                           Good night, Granny.\n                             I love you dearly.\n                                               Judy\n\n\n\n\n\n                                   The Ides of March\n\nDear D.-L.-L.,\n\nI am studying Latin prose composition.  I have been studying it.  I\nshall be studying it.  I shall be about to have been studying it.  My\nre-examination comes the 7th hour next Tuesday, and I am going to pass\nor BUST.  So you may expect to hear from me next, whole and happy and\nfree from conditions, or in fragments.\n\nI will write a respectable letter when it's over.  Tonight I have a\npressing engagement with the Ablative Absolute.\n\n                   Yours--in evident haste\n                                           J. A.\n\n\n\n\n                                       26th  March\n\nMr. D.-L.-L. Smith,\n\nSIR:  You never answer any questions; you never show the slightest\ninterest in anything I do.  You are probably the horridest one of all\nthose horrid Trustees, and the reason you are educating me is, not\nbecause you care a bit about me, but from a sense of Duty.\n\nI don't know a single thing about you.  I don't even know your name.\nIt is very uninspiring writing to a Thing.  I haven't a doubt but that\nyou throw my letters into the waste-basket without reading them.\nHereafter I shall write only about work.\n\nMy re-examinations in Latin and geometry came last week.  I passed them\nboth and am now free from conditions.\n\n                       Yours truly,\n                                   Jerusha Abbott\n\n\n\n\n                                               2nd April\n\nDear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\nI am a BEAST.\n\nPlease forget about that dreadful letter I sent you last week--I was\nfeeling terribly lonely and miserable and sore-throaty the night I\nwrote.  I didn't know it, but I was just sickening for tonsillitis and\ngrippe and lots of things mixed.  I'm in the infirmary now, and have\nbeen here for six days; this is the first time they would let me sit up\nand have a pen and paper.  The head nurse is very bossy.  But I've been\nthinking about it all the time and I shan't get well until you forgive\nme.\n\nHere is a picture of the way I look, with a bandage tied around my head\nin rabbit's ears.\n\nDoesn't that arouse your sympathy?  I am having sublingual gland\nswelling.  And I've been studying physiology all the year without ever\nhearing of sublingual glands.  How futile a thing is education!\n\nI can't write any more; I get rather shaky when I sit up too long.\nPlease forgive me for being impertinent and ungrateful.  I was badly\nbrought up.\n\n                       Yours with love,\n                                         Judy Abbott\n\n\n\n\n                                       THE INFIRMARY\n                                                   4th April\n\nDearest Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\nYesterday evening just towards dark, when I was sitting up in bed\nlooking out at the rain and feeling awfully bored with life in a great\ninstitution, the nurse appeared with a long white box addressed to me,\nand filled with the LOVELIEST pink rosebuds.  And much nicer still, it\ncontained a card with a very polite message written in a funny little\nuphill back hand (but one which shows a great deal of character). Thank\nyou, Daddy, a thousand times.  Your flowers make the first real, true\npresent I ever received in my life.  If you want to know what a baby I\nam I lay down and cried because I was so happy.\n\nNow that I am sure you read my letters, I'll make them much more\ninteresting, so they'll be worth keeping in a safe with red tape around\nthem--only please take out that dreadful one and burn it up.  I'd hate\nto think that you ever read it over.\n\nThank you for making a very sick, cross, miserable Freshman cheerful.\nProbably you have lots of loving family and friends, and you don't know\nwhat it feels like to be alone.  But I do.\n\nGoodbye--I'll promise never to be horrid again, because now I know\nyou're a real person; also I'll promise never to bother you with any\nmore questions.\n\nDo you still hate girls?\n\n                               Yours for ever,\n                                               Judy\n\n\n\n\n                                       8th hour, Monday\n\nDear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\nI hope you aren't the Trustee who sat on the toad?  It went off--I was\ntold--with quite a pop, so probably he was a fatter Trustee.\n\nDo you remember the little dugout places with gratings over them by the\nlaundry windows in the John Grier Home?  Every spring when the hoptoad\nseason opened we used to form a collection of toads and keep them in\nthose window holes; and occasionally they would spill over into the\nlaundry, causing a very pleasurable commotion on wash days.  We were\nseverely punished for our activities in this direction, but in spite of\nall discouragement the toads would collect.\n\nAnd one day--well, I won't bore you with particulars--but somehow, one\nof the fattest, biggest, JUCIEST toads got into one of those big\nleather arm chairs in the Trustees' room, and that afternoon at the\nTrustees' meeting--But I dare say you were there and recall the rest?\n\nLooking back dispassionately after a period of time, I will say that\npunishment was merited, and--if I remember rightly--adequate.\n\nI don't know why I am in such a reminiscent mood except that spring and\nthe reappearance of toads always awakens the old acquisitive instinct.\nThe only thing that keeps me from starting a collection is the fact\nthat no rule exists against it.\n\n\n                                       After chapel, Thursday\n\nWhat do you think is my favourite book?  Just now, I mean; I change\nevery three days.  Wuthering Heights.  Emily Bronte was quite young\nwhen she wrote it, and had never been outside of Haworth churchyard.\nShe had never known any men in her life; how COULD she imagine a man\nlike Heathcliffe?\n\nI couldn't do it, and I'm quite young and never outside the John Grier\nAsylum--I've had every chance in the world.  Sometimes a dreadful fear\ncomes over me that I'm not a genius.  Will you be awfully disappointed,\nDaddy, if I don't turn out to be a great author?  In the spring when\neverything is so beautiful and green and budding, I feel like turning\nmy back on lessons, and running away to play with the weather.  There\nare such lots of adventures out in the fields!  It's much more\nentertaining to live books than to write them.\n\nOw ! ! ! ! ! !\n\nThat was a shriek which brought Sallie and Julia and (for a disgusted\nmoment) the Senior from across the hall.  It was caused by a centipede\nlike this:  only worse.  Just as I had finished the last sentence and\nwas thinking what to say next--plump!--it fell off the ceiling and\nlanded at my side.  I tipped two cups off the tea table in trying to\nget away.  Sallie whacked it with the back of my hair brush--which I\nshall never be able to use again--and killed the front end, but the\nrear fifty feet ran under the bureau and escaped.\n\nThis dormitory, owing to its age and ivy-covered walls, is full of\ncentipedes.  They are dreadful creatures.  I'd rather find a tiger\nunder the bed.\n\n\n                                           Friday, 9.30 p.m.\n\nSuch a lot of troubles!  I didn't hear the rising bell this morning,\nthen I broke my shoestring while I was hurrying to dress and dropped my\ncollar button down my neck.  I was late for breakfast and also for\nfirst-hour recitation.  I forgot to take any blotting paper and my\nfountain pen leaked.  In trigonometry the Professor and I had a\ndisagreement touching a little matter of logarithms.  On looking it up,\nI find that she was right.  We had mutton stew and pie-plant for\nlunch--hate 'em both; they taste like the asylum.  The post brought me\nnothing but bills (though I must say that I never do get anything else;\nmy family are not the kind that write).  In English class this\nafternoon we had an unexpected written lesson.  This was it:\n\n               I asked no other thing,\n               No other was denied.\n               I offered Being for it;\n               The mighty merchant smiled.\n\n               Brazil?  He twirled a button\n               Without a glance my way:\n               But, madam, is there nothing else\n               That we can show today?\n\n\nThat is a poem.  I don't know who wrote it or what it means.  It was\nsimply printed out on the blackboard when we arrived and we were\nordered to comment upon it.  When I read the first verse I thought I\nhad an idea--The Mighty Merchant was a divinity who distributes\nblessings in return for virtuous deeds--but when I got to the second\nverse and found him twirling a button, it seemed a blasphemous\nsupposition, and I hastily changed my mind.  The rest of the class was\nin the same predicament; and there we sat for three-quarters of an hour\nwith blank paper and equally blank minds.  Getting an education is an\nawfully wearing process!\n\nBut this didn't end the day.  There's worse to come.\n\nIt rained so we couldn't play golf, but had to go to gymnasium instead.\nThe girl next to me banged my elbow with an Indian club.  I got home to\nfind that the box with my new blue spring dress had come, and the skirt\nwas so tight that I couldn't sit down.  Friday is sweeping day, and the\nmaid had mixed all the papers on my desk.  We had tombstone for dessert\n(milk and gelatin flavoured with vanilla).  We were kept in chapel\ntwenty minutes later than usual to listen to a speech about womanly\nwomen.  And then--just as I was settling down with a sigh of\nwell-earned relief to The Portrait of a Lady, a girl named Ackerly, a\ndough-faced, deadly, unintermittently stupid girl, who sits next to me\nin Latin because her name begins with A (I wish Mrs. Lippett had named\nme Zabriski), came to ask if Monday's lesson commenced at paragraph 69\nor 70, and stayed ONE HOUR.  She has just gone.\n\nDid you ever hear of such a discouraging series of events?  It isn't\nthe big troubles in life that require character.  Anybody can rise to a\ncrisis and face a crushing tragedy with courage, but to meet the petty\nhazards of the day with a laugh--I really think that requires SPIRIT.\n\nIt's the kind of character that I am going to develop.  I am going to\npretend that all life is just a game which I must play as skilfully and\nfairly as I can.  If I lose, I am going to shrug my shoulders and\nlaugh--also if I win.\n\nAnyway, I am going to be a sport.  You will never hear me complain\nagain, Daddy dear, because Julia wears silk stockings and centipedes\ndrop off the wall.\n\n                               Yours ever,\n                                           Judy\n\nAnswer soon.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   27th May\n\nDaddy-Long-Legs, Esq.\n\nDEAR SIR:  I am in receipt of a letter from Mrs. Lippett.  She hopes\nthat I am doing well in deportment and studies.  Since I probably have\nno place to go this summer, she will let me come back to the asylum and\nwork for my board until college opens.\n\nI HATE THE JOHN GRIER HOME.\n\nI'd rather die than go back.\n\n                   Yours most truthfully,\n                                           Jerusha Abbott\n\n\n\nCher Daddy-Jambes-Longes,\n\nVous etes un brick!\n\nJe suis tres heureuse about the farm, parceque je n'ai jamais been on a\nfarm dans ma vie and I'd hate to retourner chez John Grier, et wash\ndishes tout l'ete. There would be danger of quelque chose affreuse\nhappening, parceque j'ai perdue ma humilite d'autre fois et j'ai peur\nthat I would just break out quelque jour et smash every cup and saucer\ndans la maison.\n\nPardon brievete et paper.  Je ne peux pas send des mes nouvelles\nparceque je suis dans French class et j'ai peur que Monsieur le\nProfesseur is going to call on me tout de suite.\n\nHe did!\n\n                       Au revoir,\n                          je vous aime beaucoup.\n                                                   Judy\n\n\n\n\n                                                   30th May\n\nDear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\nDid you ever see this campus?  (That is merely a rhetorical question.\nDon't let it annoy you.) It is a heavenly spot in May.  All the shrubs\nare in blossom and the trees are the loveliest young green--even the\nold pines look fresh and new.  The grass is dotted with yellow\ndandelions and hundreds of girls in blue and white and pink dresses.\nEverybody is joyous and carefree, for vacation's coming, and with that\nto look forward to, examinations don't count.\n\nIsn't that a happy frame of mind to be in?  And oh, Daddy!  I'm the\nhappiest of all!  Because I'm not in the asylum any more; and I'm not\nanybody's nursemaid or typewriter or bookkeeper (I should have been,\nyou know, except for you).\n\nI'm sorry now for all my past badnesses.\n\nI'm sorry I was ever impertinent to Mrs. Lippett.\n\nI'm sorry I ever slapped Freddie Perkins.\n\nI'm sorry I ever filled the sugar bowl with salt.\n\nI'm sorry I ever made faces behind the Trustees' backs.\n\nI'm going to be good and sweet and kind to everybody because I'm so\nhappy.  And this summer I'm going to write and write and write and\nbegin to be a great author.  Isn't that an exalted stand to take?  Oh,\nI'm developing a beautiful character!  It droops a bit under cold and\nfrost, but it does grow fast when the sun shines.\n\nThat's the way with everybody.  I don't agree with the theory that\nadversity and sorrow and disappointment develop moral strength.  The\nhappy people are the ones who are bubbling over with kindliness.  I\nhave no faith in misanthropes.  (Fine word!  Just learned it.) You are\nnot a misanthrope are you, Daddy?\n\nI started to tell you about the campus.  I wish you'd come for a little\nvisit and let me walk you about and say:\n\n'That is the library.  This is the gas plant, Daddy dear.  The Gothic\nbuilding on your left is the gymnasium, and the Tudor Romanesque beside\nit is the new infirmary.'\n\nOh, I'm fine at showing people about.  I've done it all my life at the\nasylum, and I've been doing it all day here.  I have honestly.\n\nAnd a Man, too!\n\nThat's a great experience.  I never talked to a man before (except\noccasional Trustees, and they don't count). Pardon, Daddy, I don't mean\nto hurt your feelings when I abuse Trustees.  I don't consider that you\nreally belong among them.  You just tumbled on to the Board by chance.\nThe Trustee, as such, is fat and pompous and benevolent.  He pats one\non the head and wears a gold watch chain.\n\nThat looks like a June bug, but is meant to be a portrait of any\nTrustee except you.\n\nHowever--to resume:\n\nI have been walking and talking and having tea with a man.  And with a\nvery superior man--with Mr. Jervis Pendleton of the House of Julia; her\nuncle, in short (in long, perhaps I ought to say; he's as tall as you.)\nBeing in town on business, he decided to run out to the college and\ncall on his niece.  He's her father's youngest brother, but she doesn't\nknow him very intimately.  It seems he glanced at her when she was a\nbaby, decided he didn't like her, and has never noticed her since.\n\nAnyway, there he was, sitting in the reception room very proper with\nhis hat and stick and gloves beside him; and Julia and Sallie with\nseventh-hour recitations that they couldn't cut.  So Julia dashed into\nmy room and begged me to walk him about the campus and then deliver him\nto her when the seventh hour was over.  I said I would, obligingly but\nunenthusiastically, because I don't care much for Pendletons.\n\nBut he turned out to be a sweet lamb.  He's a real human being--not a\nPendleton at all.  We had a beautiful time; I've longed for an uncle\never since.  Do you mind pretending you're my uncle?  I believe they're\nsuperior to grandmothers.\n\nMr. Pendleton reminded me a little of you, Daddy, as you were twenty\nyears ago.  You see I know you intimately, even if we haven't ever met!\n\nHe's tall and thinnish with a dark face all over lines, and the\nfunniest underneath smile that never quite comes through but just\nwrinkles up the corners of his mouth.  And he has a way of making you\nfeel right off as though you'd known him a long time.  He's very\ncompanionable.\n\nWe walked all over the campus from the quadrangle to the athletic\ngrounds; then he said he felt weak and must have some tea.  He proposed\nthat we go to College Inn--it's just off the campus by the pine walk.\nI said we ought to go back for Julia and Sallie, but he said he didn't\nlike to have his nieces drink too much tea; it made them nervous.  So\nwe just ran away and had tea and muffins and marmalade and ice-cream\nand cake at a nice little table out on the balcony.  The inn was quite\nconveniently empty, this being the end of the month and allowances low.\n\nWe had the jolliest time!  But he had to run for his train the minute\nhe got back and he barely saw Julia at all.  She was furious with me\nfor taking him off; it seems he's an unusually rich and desirable\nuncle.  It relieved my mind to find he was rich, for the tea and things\ncost sixty cents apiece.\n\nThis morning (it's Monday now) three boxes of chocolates came by\nexpress for Julia and Sallie and me.  What do you think of that?  To be\ngetting candy from a man!\n\nI begin to feel like a girl instead of a foundling.\n\nI wish you'd come and have tea some day and let me see if I like you.\nBut wouldn't it be dreadful if I didn't? However, I know I should.\n\nBien!  I make you my compliments.\n\n                           'Jamais je ne t'oublierai.'\n                                                       Judy\n\n\nPS.  I looked in the glass this morning and found a perfectly new\ndimple that I'd never seen before.  It's very curious.  Where do you\nsuppose it came from?\n\n\n\n\n                                               9th June\n\nDear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\nHappy day!  I've just finished my last examination Physiology.  And now:\n\nThree months on a farm!\n\nI don't know what kind of a thing a farm is.  I've never been on one in\nmy life.  I've never even looked at one (except from the car window),\nbut I know I'm going to love it, and I'm going to love being FREE.\n\nI am not used even yet to being outside the John Grier Home.  Whenever\nI think of it excited little thrills chase up and down my back.  I feel\nas though I must run faster and faster and keep looking over my\nshoulder to make sure that Mrs. Lippett isn't after me with her arm\nstretched out to grab me back.\n\nI don't have to mind any one this summer, do I?\n\nYour nominal authority doesn't annoy me in the least; you are too far\naway to do any harm.  Mrs. Lippett is dead for ever, so far as I am\nconcerned, and the Semples aren't expected to overlook my moral\nwelfare, are they?  No, I am sure not.  I am entirely grown up.  Hooray!\n\nI leave you now to pack a trunk, and three boxes of teakettles and\ndishes and sofa cushions and books.\n\n                                   Yours ever,\n                                               Judy\n\n\nPS.  Here is my physiology exam.  Do you think you could have passed?\n\n\n\n\n                           LOCK WILLOW FARM,\n                                               Saturday night\n\nDearest Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\nI've only just come and I'm not unpacked, but I can't wait to tell you\nhow much I like farms.  This is a heavenly, heavenly, HEAVENLY spot!\nThe house is square like this:  And OLD.  A hundred years or so.  It\nhas a veranda on the side which I can't draw and a sweet porch in\nfront.  The picture really doesn't do it justice--those things that\nlook like feather dusters are maple trees, and the prickly ones that\nborder the drive are murmuring pines and hemlocks.  It stands on the\ntop of a hill and looks way off over miles of green meadows to another\nline of hills.\n\nThat is the way Connecticut goes, in a series of Marcelle waves; and\nLock Willow Farm is just on the crest of one wave.  The barns used to\nbe across the road where they obstructed the view, but a kind flash of\nlightning came from heaven and burnt them down.\n\nThe people are Mr. and Mrs. Semple and a hired girl and two hired men.\nThe hired people eat in the kitchen, and the Semples and Judy in the\ndining-room. We had ham and eggs and biscuits and honey and jelly-cake\nand pie and pickles and cheese and tea for supper--and a great deal of\nconversation.  I have never been so entertaining in my life; everything\nI say appears to be funny.  I suppose it is, because I've never been in\nthe country before, and my questions are backed by an all-inclusive\nignorance.\n\nThe room marked with a cross is not where the murder was committed, but\nthe one that I occupy.  It's big and square and empty, with adorable\nold-fashioned furniture and windows that have to be propped up on\nsticks and green shades trimmed with gold that fall down if you touch\nthem.  And a big square mahogany table--I'm going to spend the summer\nwith my elbows spread out on it, writing a novel.\n\nOh, Daddy, I'm so excited!  I can't wait till daylight to explore.\nIt's 8.30 now, and I am about to blow out my candle and try to go to\nsleep.  We rise at five.  Did you ever know such fun?  I can't believe\nthis is really Judy.  You and the Good Lord give me more than I\ndeserve.  I must be a very, very, VERY good person to pay.  I'm going\nto be.  You'll see.\n\n                               Good night,\n                                               Judy\n\n\nPS.  You should hear the frogs sing and the little pigs squeal and you\nshould see the new moon!  I saw it over my right shoulder.\n\n\n\n\n\n                                           LOCK WILLOW,\n                                                       12th July\n\nDear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\nHow did your secretary come to know about Lock Willow?  (That isn't a\nrhetorical question.  I am awfully curious to know.) For listen to\nthis:  Mr. Jervis Pendleton used to own this farm, but now he has given\nit to Mrs. Semple who was his old nurse.  Did you ever hear of such a\nfunny coincidence?  She still calls him 'Master Jervie' and talks about\nwhat a sweet little boy he used to be.  She has one of his baby curls\nput away in a box, and it is red--or at least reddish!\n\nSince she discovered that I know him, I have risen very much in her\nopinion.  Knowing a member of the Pendleton family is the best\nintroduction one can have at Lock Willow.  And the cream of the whole\nfamily is Master Jervis--I am pleased to say that Julia belongs to an\ninferior branch.\n\nThe farm gets more and more entertaining.  I rode on a hay wagon\nyesterday.  We have three big pigs and nine little piglets, and you\nshould see them eat.  They are pigs!  We've oceans of little baby\nchickens and ducks and turkeys and guinea fowls.  You must be mad to\nlive in a city when you might live on a farm.\n\nIt is my daily business to hunt the eggs.  I fell off a beam in the\nbarn loft yesterday, while I was trying to crawl over to a nest that\nthe black hen has stolen.  And when I came in with a scratched knee,\nMrs. Semple bound it up with witch-hazel, murmuring all the time,\n'Dear! Dear!  It seems only yesterday that Master Jervie fell off that\nvery same beam and scratched this very same knee.'\n\nThe scenery around here is perfectly beautiful.  There's a valley and a\nriver and a lot of wooded hills, and way in the distance a tall blue\nmountain that simply melts in your mouth.\n\nWe churn twice a week; and we keep the cream in the spring house which\nis made of stone with the brook running underneath.  Some of the\nfarmers around here have a separator, but we don't care for these\nnew-fashioned ideas.  It may be a little harder to separate the cream\nin pans, but it's sufficiently better to pay.  We have six calves; and\nI've chosen the names for all of them.\n\n1.  Sylvia, because she was born in the woods.\n\n2.  Lesbia, after the Lesbia in Catullus.\n\n3.  Sallie.\n\n4.  Julia--a spotted, nondescript animal.\n\n5.  Judy, after me.\n\n6.  Daddy-Long-Legs. You don't mind, do you, Daddy?  He's pure Jersey\nand has a sweet disposition.  He looks like this--you can see how\nappropriate the name is.\n\nI haven't had time yet to begin my immortal novel; the farm keeps me\ntoo busy.\n\n                               Yours always,\n                                               Judy\n\n\nPS.  I've learned to make doughnuts.\n\nPS.  (2) If you are thinking of raising chickens, let me recommend Buff\nOrpingtons.  They haven't any pin feathers.\n\nPS.  (3) I wish I could send you a pat of the nice, fresh butter I\nchurned yesterday.  I'm a fine dairy-maid!\n\nPS.  (4) This is a picture of Miss Jerusha Abbott, the future great\nauthor, driving home the cows.\n\n\n\n                                           Sunday\n\nDear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\nIsn't it funny?  I started to write to you yesterday afternoon, but as\nfar as I got was the heading, 'Dear Daddy-Long-Legs', and then I\nremembered I'd promised to pick some blackberries for supper, so I went\noff and left the sheet lying on the table, and when I came back today,\nwhat do you think I found sitting in the middle of the page?  A real\ntrue Daddy-Long-Legs!\n\nI picked him up very gently by one leg, and dropped him out of the\nwindow.  I wouldn't hurt one of them for the world.  They always remind\nme of you.\n\nWe hitched up the spring wagon this morning and drove to the Centre to\nchurch.  It's a sweet little white frame church with a spire and three\nDoric columns in front (or maybe Ionic--I always get them mixed).\n\nA nice sleepy sermon with everybody drowsily waving palm-leaf fans, and\nthe only sound, aside from the minister, the buzzing of locusts in the\ntrees outside.  I didn't wake up till I found myself on my feet singing\nthe hymn, and then I was awfully sorry I hadn't listened to the sermon;\nI should like to know more of the psychology of a man who would pick\nout such a hymn.  This was it:\n\n           Come, leave your sports and earthly toys\n           And join me in celestial joys.\n           Or else, dear friend, a long farewell.\n           I leave you now to sink to hell.\n\n\nI find that it isn't safe to discuss religion with the Semples.  Their\nGod (whom they have inherited intact from their remote Puritan\nancestors) is a narrow, irrational, unjust, mean, revengeful, bigoted\nPerson.  Thank heaven I don't inherit God from anybody!  I am free to\nmake mine up as I wish Him.  He's kind and sympathetic and imaginative\nand forgiving and understanding--and He has a sense of humour.\n\nI like the Semples immensely; their practice is so superior to their\ntheory.  They are better than their own God.  I told them so--and they\nare horribly troubled.  They think I am blasphemous--and I think they\nare!  We've dropped theology from our conversation.\n\nThis is Sunday afternoon.\n\nAmasai (hired man) in a purple tie and some bright yellow buckskin\ngloves, very red and shaved, has just driven off with Carrie (hired\ngirl) in a big hat trimmed with red roses and a blue muslin dress and\nher hair curled as tight as it will curl.  Amasai spent all the morning\nwashing the buggy; and Carrie stayed home from church ostensibly to\ncook the dinner, but really to iron the muslin dress.\n\nIn two minutes more when this letter is finished I am going to settle\ndown to a book which I found in the attic.  It's entitled, On the\nTrail, and sprawled across the front page in a funny little-boy hand:\n\n               Jervis Pendleton\n               if this book should ever roam,\n               Box its ears and send it home.\n\n\nHe spent the summer here once after he had been ill, when he was about\neleven years old; and he left On the Trail behind.  It looks well\nread--the marks of his grimy little hands are frequent!  Also in a\ncorner of the attic there is a water wheel and a windmill and some bows\nand arrows.  Mrs. Semple talks so constantly about him that I begin to\nbelieve he really lives--not a grown man with a silk hat and walking\nstick, but a nice, dirty, tousle-headed boy who clatters up the stairs\nwith an awful racket, and leaves the screen doors open, and is always\nasking for cookies.  (And getting them, too, if I know Mrs. Semple!) He\nseems to have been an adventurous little soul--and brave and truthful.\nI'm sorry to think he is a Pendleton; he was meant for something better.\n\nWe're going to begin threshing oats tomorrow; a steam engine is coming\nand three extra men.\n\nIt grieves me to tell you that Buttercup (the spotted cow with one\nhorn, Mother of Lesbia) has done a disgraceful thing.  She got into the\norchard Friday evening and ate apples under the trees, and ate and ate\nuntil they went to her head.  For two days she has been perfectly dead\ndrunk!  That is the truth I am telling.  Did you ever hear anything so\nscandalous?\n\n           Sir,\n               I remain,\n                     Your affectionate orphan,\n                                               Judy Abbott\n\n\nPS.  Indians in the first chapter and highwaymen in the second.  I hold\nmy breath.  What can the third contain?  'Red Hawk leapt twenty feet in\nthe air and bit the dust.'  That is the subject of the frontispiece.\nAren't Judy and Jervie having fun?\n\n\n\n\n                                               15th September\n\nDear Daddy,\n\nI was weighed yesterday on the flour scales in the general store at the\nComers.  I've gained nine pounds!  Let me recommend Lock Willow as a\nhealth resort.\n\n                               Yours ever,\n                                               Judy\n\n\n\n\nDear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\nBehold me--a Sophomore!  I came up last Friday, sorry to leave Lock\nWillow, but glad to see the campus again.  It is a pleasant sensation\nto come back to something familiar.  I am beginning to feel at home in\ncollege, and in command of the situation; I am beginning, in fact, to\nfeel at home in the world--as though I really belonged to it and had\nnot just crept in on sufferance.\n\nI don't suppose you understand in the least what I am trying to say.  A\nperson important enough to be a Trustee can't appreciate the feelings\nof a person unimportant enough to be a foundling.\n\nAnd now, Daddy, listen to this.  Whom do you think I am rooming with?\nSallie McBride and Julia Rutledge Pendleton.  It's the truth.  We have\na study and three little bedrooms--VOILA!\n\nSallie and I decided last spring that we should like to room together,\nand Julia made up her mind to stay with Sallie--why, I can't imagine,\nfor they are not a bit alike; but the Pendletons are naturally\nconservative and inimical (fine word!) to change.  Anyway, here we are.\nThink of Jerusha Abbott, late of the John Grier Home for Orphans,\nrooming with a Pendleton.  This is a democratic country.\n\nSallie is running for class president, and unless all signs fail, she\nis going to be elected.  Such an atmosphere of intrigue you should see\nwhat politicians we are!  Oh, I tell you, Daddy, when we women get our\nrights, you men will have to look alive in order to keep yours.\nElection comes next Saturday, and we're going to have a torchlight\nprocession in the evening, no matter who wins.\n\nI am beginning chemistry, a most unusual study.  I've never seen\nanything like it before.  Molecules and Atoms are the material\nemployed, but I'll be in a position to discuss them more definitely\nnext month.\n\nI am also taking argumentation and logic.\n\nAlso history of the whole world.\n\nAlso plays of William Shakespeare.\n\nAlso French.\n\nIf this keeps up many years longer, I shall become quite intelligent.\n\nI should rather have elected economics than French, but I didn't dare,\nbecause I was afraid that unless I re-elected French, the Professor\nwould not let me pass--as it was, I just managed to squeeze through the\nJune examination.  But I will say that my high-school preparation was\nnot very adequate.\n\nThere's one girl in the class who chatters away in French as fast as\nshe does in English.  She went abroad with her parents when she was a\nchild, and spent three years in a convent school.  You can imagine how\nbright she is compared with the rest of us--irregular verbs are mere\nplaythings.  I wish my parents had chucked me into a French convent\nwhen I was little instead of a foundling asylum.  Oh no, I don't\neither!  Because then maybe I should never have known you.  I'd rather\nknow you than French.\n\nGoodbye, Daddy.  I must call on Harriet Martin now, and, having\ndiscussed the chemical situation, casually drop a few thoughts on the\nsubject of our next president.\n\n                       Yours in politics,\n                                           J. Abbott\n\n\n\n\n                                               17th October\n\nDear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\nSupposing the swimming tank in the gymnasium were filled full of lemon\njelly, could a person trying to swim manage to keep on top or would he\nsink?\n\nWe were having lemon jelly for dessert when the question came up.  We\ndiscussed it heatedly for half an hour and it's still unsettled.\nSallie thinks that she could swim in it, but I am perfectly sure that\nthe best swimmer in the world would sink.  Wouldn't it be funny to be\ndrowned in lemon jelly?\n\nTwo other problems are engaging the attention of our table.\n\n1st.  What shape are the rooms in an octagon house?  Some of the girls\ninsist that they're square; but I think they'd have to be shaped like a\npiece of pie.  Don't you?\n\n2nd.  Suppose there were a great big hollow sphere made of\nlooking-glass and you were sitting inside.  Where would it stop\nreflecting your face and begin reflecting your back?  The more one\nthinks about this problem, the more puzzling it becomes.  You can see\nwith what deep philosophical reflection we engage our leisure!\n\nDid I ever tell you about the election?  It happened three weeks ago,\nbut so fast do we live, that three weeks is ancient history.  Sallie\nwas elected, and we had a torchlight parade with transparencies saying,\n'McBride for Ever,' and a band consisting of fourteen pieces (three\nmouth organs and eleven combs).\n\nWe're very important persons now in '258.' Julia and I come in for a\ngreat deal of reflected glory.  It's quite a social strain to be living\nin the same house with a president.\n\nBonne nuit, cher Daddy.\n\n                       Acceptez mez compliments,\n                           Tres respectueux,\n                               je suis,\n                                   Votre Judy\n\n\n\n\n                                               12th November\n\nDear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\nWe beat the Freshmen at basket ball yesterday.  Of course we're\npleased--but oh, if we could only beat the juniors!  I'd be willing to\nbe black and blue all over and stay in bed a week in a witch-hazel\ncompress.\n\nSallie has invited me to spend the Christmas vacation with her.  She\nlives in Worcester, Massachusetts.  Wasn't it nice of her?  I shall\nlove to go.  I've never been in a private family in my life, except at\nLock Willow, and the Semples were grown-up and old and don't count.\nBut the McBrides have a houseful of children (anyway two or three) and\na mother and father and grandmother, and an Angora cat.  It's a\nperfectly complete family!  Packing your trunk and going away is more\nfun than staying behind.  I am terribly excited at the prospect.\n\nSeventh hour--I must run to rehearsal.  I'm to be in the Thanksgiving\ntheatricals.  A prince in a tower with a velvet tunic and yellow curls.\nIsn't that a lark?\n\n                                       Yours,\n                                                   J. A.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   Saturday\n\nDo you want to know what I look like?  Here's a photograph of all three\nthat Leonora Fenton took.\n\nThe light one who is laughing is Sallie, and the tall one with her nose\nin the air is Julia, and the little one with the hair blowing across\nher face is Judy--she is really more beautiful than that, but the sun\nwas in her eyes.\n\n\n\n\n                               'STONE GATE',\n                                   WORCESTER, MASS.,\n                                         31st December\n\nDear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\nI meant to write to you before and thank you for your Christmas cheque,\nbut life in the McBride household is very absorbing, and I don't seem\nable to find two consecutive minutes to spend at a desk.\n\nI bought a new gown--one that I didn't need, but just wanted.  My\nChristmas present this year is from Daddy-Long-Legs; my family just\nsent love.\n\nI've been having the most beautiful vacation visiting Sallie.  She\nlives in a big old-fashioned brick house with white trimmings set back\nfrom the street--exactly the kind of house that I used to look at so\ncuriously when I was in the John Grier Home, and wonder what it could\nbe like inside.  I never expected to see with my own eyes--but here I\nam!  Everything is so comfortable and restful and homelike; I walk from\nroom to room and drink in the furnishings.\n\nIt is the most perfect house for children to be brought up in; with\nshadowy nooks for hide and seek, and open fire places for pop-corn, and\nan attic to romp in on rainy days and slippery banisters with a\ncomfortable flat knob at the bottom, and a great big sunny kitchen, and\na nice, fat, sunny cook who has lived in the family thirteen years and\nalways saves out a piece of dough for the children to bake.  Just the\nsight of such a house makes you want to be a child all over again.\n\nAnd as for families!  I never dreamed they could be so nice.  Sallie\nhas a father and mother and grandmother, and the sweetest\nthree-year-old baby sister all over curls, and a medium-sized brother\nwho always forgets to wipe his feet, and a big, good-looking brother\nnamed Jimmie, who is a junior at Princeton.\n\nWe have the jolliest times at the table--everybody laughs and jokes and\ntalks at once, and we don't have to say grace beforehand.  It's a\nrelief not having to thank Somebody for every mouthful you eat.  (I\ndare say I'm blasphemous; but you'd be, too, if you'd offered as much\nobligatory thanks as I have.)\n\nSuch a lot of things we've done--I can't begin to tell you about them.\nMr. McBride owns a factory and Christmas eve he had a tree for the\nemployees' children.  It was in the long packing-room which was\ndecorated with evergreens and holly.  Jimmie McBride was dressed as\nSanta Claus and Sallie and I helped him distribute the presents.\n\nDear me, Daddy, but it was a funny sensation!  I felt as benevolent as\na Trustee of the John Grier home.  I kissed one sweet, sticky little\nboy--but I don't think I patted any of them on the head!\n\nAnd two days after Christmas, they gave a dance at their own house for\nME.\n\nIt was the first really true ball I ever attended--college doesn't\ncount where we dance with girls.  I had a new white evening gown (your\nChristmas present--many thanks) and long white gloves and white satin\nslippers.  The only drawback to my perfect, utter, absolute happiness\nwas the fact that Mrs. Lippett couldn't see me leading the cotillion\nwith Jimmie McBride.  Tell her about it, please, the next time you\nvisit the J. G. H.\n\n                       Yours ever,\n                                    Judy Abbott\n\n\nPS.  Would you be terribly displeased, Daddy, if I didn't turn out to\nbe a Great Author after all, but just a Plain Girl?\n\n\n\n\n                                       6.30, Saturday\n\nDear Daddy,\n\nWe started to walk to town today, but mercy! how it poured.  I like\nwinter to be winter with snow instead of rain.\n\nJulia's desirable uncle called again this afternoon--and brought a\nfive-pound box of chocolates.  There are advantages, you see, about\nrooming with Julia.\n\nOur innocent prattle appeared to amuse him and he waited for a later\ntrain in order to take tea in the study.  We had an awful lot of\ntrouble getting permission.  It's hard enough entertaining fathers and\ngrandfathers, but uncles are a step worse; and as for brothers and\ncousins, they are next to impossible.  Julia had to swear that he was\nher uncle before a notary public and then have the county clerk's\ncertificate attached.  (Don't I know a lot of law?) And even then I\ndoubt if we could have had our tea if the Dean had chanced to see how\nyoungish and good-looking Uncle Jervis is.\n\nAnyway, we had it, with brown bread Swiss cheese sandwiches.  He helped\nmake them and then ate four.  I told him that I had spent last summer\nat Lock Willow, and we had a beautiful gossipy time about the Semples,\nand the horses and cows and chickens.  All the horses that he used to\nknow are dead, except Grover, who was a baby colt at the time of his\nlast visit--and poor Grove now is so old he can just limp about the\npasture.\n\nHe asked if they still kept doughnuts in a yellow crock with a blue\nplate over it on the bottom shelf of the pantry--and they do!  He\nwanted to know if there was still a woodchuck's hole under the pile of\nrocks in the night pasture--and there is!  Amasai caught a big, fat,\ngrey one there this summer, the twenty-fifth great-grandson of the one\nMaster Jervis caught when he was a little boy.\n\nI called him 'Master Jervie' to his face, but he didn't appear to be\ninsulted.  Julia says she has never seen him so amiable; he's usually\npretty unapproachable.  But Julia hasn't a bit of tact; and men, I\nfind, require a great deal.  They purr if you rub them the right way\nand spit if you don't. (That isn't a very elegant metaphor.  I mean it\nfiguratively.)\n\nWe're reading Marie Bashkirtseff's journal.  Isn't it amazing?  Listen\nto this:  'Last night I was seized by a fit of despair that found\nutterance in moans, and that finally drove me to throw the dining-room\nclock into the sea.'\n\nIt makes me almost hope I'm not a genius; they must be very wearing to\nhave about--and awfully destructive to the furniture.\n\nMercy! how it keeps Pouring.  We shall have to swim to chapel tonight.\n\n                               Yours ever,\n                                               Judy\n\n\n\n\n                                               20th Jan.\n\nDear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\nDid you ever have a sweet baby girl who was stolen from the cradle in\ninfancy?\n\nMaybe I am she!  If we were in a novel, that would be the denouement,\nwouldn't it?\n\nIt's really awfully queer not to know what one is--sort of exciting and\nromantic.  There are such a lot of possibilities.  Maybe I'm not\nAmerican; lots of people aren't. I may be straight descended from the\nancient Romans, or I may be a Viking's daughter, or I may be the child\nof a Russian exile and belong by rights in a Siberian prison, or maybe\nI'm a Gipsy--I think perhaps I am.  I have a very WANDERING spirit,\nthough I haven't as yet had much chance to develop it.\n\nDo you know about that one scandalous blot in my career the time I ran\naway from the asylum because they punished me for stealing cookies?\nIt's down in the books free for any Trustee to read.  But really,\nDaddy, what could you expect?  When you put a hungry little nine-year\ngirl in the pantry scouring knives, with the cookie jar at her elbow,\nand go off and leave her alone; and then suddenly pop in again,\nwouldn't you expect to find her a bit crumby?  And then when you jerk\nher by the elbow and box her ears, and make her leave the table when\nthe pudding comes, and tell all the other children that it's because\nshe's a thief, wouldn't you expect her to run away?\n\nI only ran four miles.  They caught me and brought me back; and every\nday for a week I was tied, like a naughty puppy, to a stake in the back\nyard while the other children were out at recess.\n\nOh, dear!  There's the chapel bell, and after chapel I have a committee\nmeeting.  I'm sorry because I meant to write you a very entertaining\nletter this time.\n\n                               Auf wiedersehen\n                                   Cher Daddy,\n                                       Pax tibi!\n                                                   Judy\n\n\nPS.  There's one thing I'm perfectly sure of I'm not a Chinaman.\n\n\n\n\n                                               4th February\n\nDear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\nJimmie McBride has sent me a Princeton banner as big as one end of the\nroom; I am very grateful to him for remembering me, but I don't know\nwhat on earth to do with it.  Sallie and Julia won't let me hang it up;\nour room this year is furnished in red, and you can imagine what an\neffect we'd have if I added orange and black.  But it's such nice,\nwarm, thick felt, I hate to waste it.  Would it be very improper to\nhave it made into a bath robe?  My old one shrank when it was washed.\n\nI've entirely omitted of late telling you what I am learning, but\nthough you might not imagine it from my letters, my time is exclusively\noccupied with study.  It's a very bewildering matter to get educated in\nfive branches at once.\n\n'The test of true scholarship,' says Chemistry Professor, 'is a\npainstaking passion for detail.'\n\n'Be careful not to keep your eyes glued to detail,' says History\nProfessor.  'Stand far enough away to get a perspective of the whole.'\n\nYou can see with what nicety we have to trim our sails between\nchemistry and history.  I like the historical method best.  If I say\nthat William the Conqueror came over in 1492, and Columbus discovered\nAmerica in 1100 or 1066 or whenever it was, that's a mere detail that\nthe Professor overlooks.  It gives a feeling of security and\nrestfulness to the history recitation, that is entirely lacking in\nchemistry.\n\nSixth-hour bell--I must go to the laboratory and look into a little\nmatter of acids and salts and alkalis.  I've burned a hole as big as a\nplate in the front of my chemistry apron, with hydrochloric acid.  If\nthe theory worked, I ought to be able to neutralize that hole with good\nstrong ammonia, oughtn't I?\n\nExaminations next week, but who's afraid?\n\n                               Yours ever,\n                                           Judy\n\n\n\n\n                                               5th March\n\nDear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\nThere is a March wind blowing, and the sky is filled with heavy, black\nmoving clouds.  The crows in the pine trees are making such a clamour!\nIt's an intoxicating, exhilarating, CALLING noise.  You want to close\nyour books and be off over the hills to race with the wind.\n\nWe had a paper chase last Saturday over five miles of squashy 'cross\ncountry.  The fox (composed of three girls and a bushel or so of\nconfetti) started half an hour before the twenty-seven hunters.  I was\none of the twenty-seven; eight dropped by the wayside; we ended\nnineteen.  The trail led over a hill, through a cornfield, and into a\nswamp where we had to leap lightly from hummock to hummock.  of course\nhalf of us went in ankle deep.  We kept losing the trail, and we wasted\ntwenty-five minutes over that swamp.  Then up a hill through some woods\nand in at a barn window!  The barn doors were all locked and the window\nwas up high and pretty small.  I don't call that fair, do you?\n\nBut we didn't go through; we circumnavigated the barn and picked up the\ntrail where it issued by way of a low shed roof on to the top of a\nfence.  The fox thought he had us there, but we fooled him.  Then\nstraight away over two miles of rolling meadow, and awfully hard to\nfollow, for the confetti was getting sparse.  The rule is that it must\nbe at the most six feet apart, but they were the longest six feet I\never saw.  Finally, after two hours of steady trotting, we tracked\nMonsieur Fox into the kitchen of Crystal Spring (that's a farm where\nthe girls go in bob sleighs and hay wagons for chicken and waffle\nsuppers) and we found the three foxes placidly eating milk and honey\nand biscuits.  They hadn't thought we would get that far; they were\nexpecting us to stick in the barn window.\n\nBoth sides insist that they won.  I think we did, don't you?  Because\nwe caught them before they got back to the campus.  Anyway, all\nnineteen of us settled like locusts over the furniture and clamoured\nfor honey.  There wasn't enough to go round, but Mrs. Crystal Spring\n(that's our pet name for her; she's by rights a Johnson) brought up a\njar of strawberry jam and a can of maple syrup--just made last\nweek--and three loaves of brown bread.\n\nWe didn't get back to college till half-past six--half an hour late for\ndinner--and we went straight in without dressing, and with perfectly\nunimpaired appetites!  Then we all cut evening chapel, the state of our\nboots being enough of an excuse.\n\nI never told you about examinations.  I passed everything with the\nutmost ease--I know the secret now, and am never going to fail again.\nI shan't be able to graduate with honours though, because of that\nbeastly Latin prose and geometry Freshman year.  But I don't care.\nWot's the hodds so long as you're 'appy?  (That's a quotation.  I've\nbeen reading the English classics.)\n\nSpeaking of classics, have you ever read Hamlet?  If you haven't, do it\nright off.  It's PERFECTLY CORKING.  I've been hearing about\nShakespeare all my life, but I had no idea he really wrote so well; I\nalways suspected him of going largely on his reputation.\n\nI have a beautiful play that I invented a long time ago when I first\nlearned to read.  I put myself to sleep every night by pretending I'm\nthe person (the most important person) in the book I'm reading at the\nmoment.\n\nAt present I'm Ophelia--and such a sensible Ophelia!  I keep Hamlet\namused all the time, and pet him and scold him and make him wrap up his\nthroat when he has a cold.  I've entirely cured him of being\nmelancholy.  The King and Queen are both dead--an accident at sea; no\nfuneral necessary--so Hamlet and I are ruling in Denmark without any\nbother.  We have the kingdom working beautifully.  He takes care of the\ngoverning, and I look after the charities.  I have just founded some\nfirst-class orphan asylums.  If you or any of the other Trustees would\nlike to visit them, I shall be pleased to show you through.  I think\nyou might find a great many helpful suggestions.\n\n                       I remain, sir,\n                           Yours most graciously,\n                               OPHELIA,\n                                   Queen of Denmark.\n\n\n\n\n                                           24th March,\n                                           maybe the 25th\n\nDear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\nI don't believe I can be going to Heaven--I am getting such a lot of\ngood things here; it wouldn't be fair to get them hereafter too.\nListen to what has happened.\n\nJerusha Abbott has won the short-story contest (a twenty-five dollar\nprize) that the Monthly holds every year.  And she's a Sophomore!  The\ncontestants are mostly Seniors.  When I saw my name posted, I couldn't\nquite believe it was true.  Maybe I am going to be an author after all.\nI wish Mrs. Lippett hadn't given me such a silly name--it sounds like\nan author-ess, doesn't it?\n\nAlso I have been chosen for the spring dramatics--As You Like It out of\ndoors.  I am going to be Celia, own cousin to Rosalind.\n\nAnd lastly:  Julia and Sallie and I are going to New York next Friday\nto do some spring shopping and stay all night and go to the theatre the\nnext day with 'Master Jervie.'  He invited us.  Julia is going to stay\nat home with her family, but Sallie and I are going to stop at the\nMartha Washington Hotel.  Did you ever hear of anything so exciting?\nI've never been in a hotel in my life, nor in a theatre; except once\nwhen the Catholic Church had a festival and invited the orphans, but\nthat wasn't a real play and it doesn't count.\n\nAnd what do you think we're going to see?  Hamlet.  Think of that!  We\nstudied it for four weeks in Shakespeare class and I know it by heart.\n\nI am so excited over all these prospects that I can scarcely sleep.\n\nGoodbye, Daddy.\n\nThis is a very entertaining world.\n\n                                       Yours ever,\n                                                       Judy\n\n\nPS.  I've just looked at the calendar.  It's the 28th.\n\nAnother postscript.\n\nI saw a street car conductor today with one brown eye and one blue.\nWouldn't he make a nice villain for a detective story?\n\n\n\n\n                                                   7th April\n\nDear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\nMercy!  Isn't New York big?  Worcester is nothing to it.  Do you mean\nto tell me that you actually live in all that confusion?  I don't\nbelieve that I shall recover for months from the bewildering effect of\ntwo days of it.  I can't begin to tell you all the amazing things I've\nseen; I suppose you know, though, since you live there yourself.\n\nBut aren't the streets entertaining?  And the people?  And the shops?\nI never saw such lovely things as there are in the windows.  It makes\nyou want to devote your life to wearing clothes.\n\nSallie and Julia and I went shopping together Saturday morning.  Julia\nwent into the very most gorgeous place I ever saw, white and gold walls\nand blue carpets and blue silk curtains and gilt chairs.  A perfectly\nbeautiful lady with yellow hair and a long black silk trailing gown\ncame to meet us with a welcoming smile.  I thought we were paying a\nsocial call, and started to shake hands, but it seems we were only\nbuying hats--at least Julia was.  She sat down in front of a mirror and\ntried on a dozen, each lovelier than the last, and bought the two\nloveliest of all.\n\nI can't imagine any joy in life greater than sitting down in front of a\nmirror and buying any hat you choose without having first to consider\nthe price!  There's no doubt about it, Daddy; New York would rapidly\nundermine this fine stoical character which the John Grier Home so\npatiently built up.\n\nAnd after we'd finished our shopping, we met Master Jervie at Sherry's.\nI suppose you've been in Sherry's? Picture that, then picture the\ndining-room of the John Grier Home with its oilcloth-covered tables,\nand white crockery that you CAN'T break, and wooden-handled knives and\nforks; and fancy the way I felt!\n\nI ate my fish with the wrong fork, but the waiter very kindly gave me\nanother so that nobody noticed.\n\nAnd after luncheon we went to the theatre--it was dazzling, marvellous,\nunbelievable--I dream about it every night.\n\nIsn't Shakespeare wonderful?\n\nHamlet is so much better on the stage than when we analyze it in class;\nI appreciated it before, but now, dear me!\n\nI think, if you don't mind, that I'd rather be an actress than a\nwriter.  Wouldn't you like me to leave college and go into a dramatic\nschool?  And then I'll send you a box for all my performances, and\nsmile at you across the footlights.  Only wear a red rose in your\nbuttonhole, please, so I'll surely smile at the right man.  It would be\nan awfully embarrassing mistake if I picked out the wrong one.\n\nWe came back Saturday night and had our dinner in the train, at little\ntables with pink lamps and negro waiters.  I never heard of meals being\nserved in trains before, and I inadvertently said so.\n\n'Where on earth were you brought up?' said Julia to me.\n\n'In a village,' said I meekly, to Julia.\n\n'But didn't you ever travel?' said she to me.\n\n'Not till I came to college, and then it was only a hundred and sixty\nmiles and we didn't eat,' said I to her.\n\nShe's getting quite interested in me, because I say such funny things.\nI try hard not to, but they do pop out when I'm surprised--and I'm\nsurprised most of the time.  It's a dizzying experience, Daddy, to pass\neighteen years in the John Grier Home, and then suddenly to be plunged\ninto the WORLD.\n\nBut I'm getting acclimated.  I don't make such awful mistakes as I did;\nand I don't feel uncomfortable any more with the other girls.  I used\nto squirm whenever people looked at me.  I felt as though they saw\nright through my sham new clothes to the checked ginghams underneath.\nBut I'm not letting the ginghams bother me any more.  Sufficient unto\nyesterday is the evil thereof.\n\nI forgot to tell you about our flowers.  Master Jervie gave us each a\nbig bunch of violets and lilies-of-the-valley. Wasn't that sweet of\nhim?  I never used to care much for men--judging by Trustees--but I'm\nchanging my mind.\n\nEleven pages--this is a letter!  Have courage.  I'm going to stop.\n\n                           Yours always,\n                                           Judy\n\n\n\n\n                                                   10th April\n\nDear Mr. Rich-Man,\n\nHere's your cheque for fifty dollars.  Thank you very much, but I do\nnot feel that I can keep it.  My allowance is sufficient to afford all\nof the hats that I need.  I am sorry that I wrote all that silly stuff\nabout the millinery shop; it's just that I had never seen anything like\nit before.\n\nHowever, I wasn't begging!  And I would rather not accept any more\ncharity than I have to.\n\n                   Sincerely yours,\n                                     Jerusha Abbott\n\n\n\n\n                                           11th April\n\nDearest Daddy,\n\nWill you please forgive me for the letter I wrote you yesterday?  After\nI posted it I was sorry, and tried to get it back, but that beastly\nmail clerk wouldn't give it back to me.\n\nIt's the middle of the night now; I've been awake for hours thinking\nwhat a Worm I am--what a Thousand-legged Worm--and that's the worst I\ncan say!  I've closed the door very softly into the study so as not to\nwake Julia and Sallie, and am sitting up in bed writing to you on paper\ntorn out of my history note-book.\n\nI just wanted to tell you that I am sorry I was so impolite about your\ncheque.  I know you meant it kindly, and I think you're an old dear to\ntake so much trouble for such a silly thing as a hat.  I ought to have\nreturned it very much more graciously.\n\nBut in any case, I had to return it.  It's different with me than with\nother girls.  They can take things naturally from people.  They have\nfathers and brothers and aunts and uncles; but I can't be on any such\nrelations with any one.  I like to pretend that you belong to me, just\nto play with the idea, but of course I know you don't. I'm alone,\nreally--with my back to the wall fighting the world--and I get sort of\ngaspy when I think about it.  I put it out of my mind, and keep on\npretending; but don't you see, Daddy?  I can't accept any more money\nthan I have to, because some day I shall be wanting to pay it back, and\neven as great an author as I intend to be won't be able to face a\nPERFECTLY TREMENDOUS debt.\n\nI'd love pretty hats and things, but I mustn't mortgage the future to\npay for them.\n\nYou'll forgive me, won't you, for being so rude?  I have an awful habit\nof writing impulsively when I first think things, and then posting the\nletter beyond recall.  But if I sometimes seem thoughtless and\nungrateful, I never mean it.  In my heart I thank you always for the\nlife and freedom and independence that you have given me.  My childhood\nwas just a long, sullen stretch of revolt, and now I am so happy every\nmoment of the day that I can't believe it's true.  I feel like a\nmade-up heroine in a story-book.\n\nIt's a quarter past two.  I'm going to tiptoe out to post this off now.\nYou'll receive it in the next mail after the other; so you won't have a\nvery long time to think bad of me.\n\n                       Good night, Daddy,\n                           I love you always,\n                                               Judy\n\n\n\n\n                                                   4th May\n\nDear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\nField Day last Saturday.  It was a very spectacular occasion.  First we\nhad a parade of all the classes, with everybody dressed in white linen,\nthe Seniors carrying blue and gold Japanese umbrellas, and the juniors\nwhite and yellow banners.  Our class had crimson balloons--very\nfetching, especially as they were always getting loose and floating\noff--and the Freshmen wore green tissue-paper hats with long streamers.\nAlso we had a band in blue uniforms hired from town.  Also about a\ndozen funny people, like clowns in a circus, to keep the spectators\nentertained between events.\n\nJulia was dressed as a fat country man with a linen duster and whiskers\nand baggy umbrella.  Patsy Moriarty (Patrici really.  Did you ever hear\nsuch a name?  Mrs. Lippett couldn't have done better) who is tall and\nthin was Julia's wife in a absurd green bonnet over one ear.  Waves of\nlaughter followed them the whole length of the course.  Julia played\nthe part extremely well.  I never dreamed that a Pendleton could\ndisplay so much comedy spirit--begging Master Jervie's pardon; I don't\nconsider him a true Pendleton though, any more than I consider you a\ntrue Trustee.\n\nSallie and I weren't in the parade because we were entered for the\nevents.  And what do you think?  We both won!  At least in something.\nWe tried for the running broad jump and lost; but Sallie won the\npole-vaulting (seven feet three inches) and I won the fifty-yard sprint\n(eight seconds).\n\nI was pretty panting at the end, but it was great fun, with the whole\nclass waving balloons and cheering and yelling:\n\n               What's the matter with Judy Abbott?\n               She's all right.\n               Who's all right?\n               Judy Ab-bott!\n\n\nThat, Daddy, is true fame.  Then trotting back to the dressing tent and\nbeing rubbed down with alcohol and having a lemon to suck.  You see\nwe're very professional.  It's a fine thing to win an event for your\nclass, because the class that wins the most gets the athletic cup for\nthe year.  The Seniors won it this year, with seven events to their\ncredit.  The athletic association gave a dinner in the gymnasium to all\nof the winners.  We had fried soft-shell crabs, and chocolate ice-cream\nmoulded in the shape of basket balls.\n\nI sat up half of last night reading Jane Eyre.  Are you old enough,\nDaddy, to remember sixty years ago?  And, if so, did people talk that\nway?\n\nThe haughty Lady Blanche says to the footman, 'Stop your chattering,\nknave, and do my bidding.'  Mr. Rochester talks about the metal welkin\nwhen he means the sky; and as for the mad woman who laughs like a hyena\nand sets fire to bed curtains and tears up wedding veils and\nBITES--it's melodrama of the purest, but just the same, you read and\nread and read.  I can't see how any girl could have written such a\nbook, especially any girl who was brought up in a churchyard.  There's\nsomething about those Brontes that fascinates me.  Their books, their\nlives, their spirit.  Where did they get it?  When I was reading about\nlittle Jane's troubles in the charity school, I got so angry that I had\nto go out and take a walk.  I understood exactly how she felt.  Having\nknown Mrs. Lippett, I could see Mr. Brocklehurst.\n\nDon't be outraged, Daddy.  I am not intimating that the John Grier Home\nwas like the Lowood Institute.  We had plenty to eat and plenty to\nwear, sufficient water to wash in, and a furnace in the cellar.  But\nthere was one deadly likeness.  Our lives were absolutely monotonous\nand uneventful.  Nothing nice ever happened, except ice-cream on\nSundays, and even that was regular.  In all the eighteen years I was\nthere I only had one adventure--when the woodshed burned.  We had to\nget up in the night and dress so as to be ready in case the house\nshould catch.  But it didn't catch and we went back to bed.\n\nEverybody likes a few surprises; it's a perfectly natural human\ncraving.  But I never had one until Mrs. Lippett called me to the\noffice to tell me that Mr. John Smith was going to send me to college.\nAnd then she broke the news so gradually that it just barely shocked me.\n\nYou know, Daddy, I think that the most necessary quality for any person\nto have is imagination.  It makes people able to put themselves in\nother people's places.  It makes them kind and sympathetic and\nunderstanding.  It ought to be cultivated in children.  But the John\nGrier Home instantly stamped out the slightest flicker that appeared.\nDuty was the one quality that was encouraged.  I don't think children\nought to know the meaning of the word; it's odious, detestable.  They\nought to do everything from love.\n\nWait until you see the orphan asylum that I am going to be the head of!\nIt's my favourite play at night before I go to sleep.  I plan it out to\nthe littlest detail--the meals and clothes and study and amusements and\npunishments; for even my superior orphans are sometimes bad.\n\nBut anyway, they are going to be happy.  I think that every one, no\nmatter how many troubles he may have when he grows up, ought to have a\nhappy childhood to look back upon.  And if I ever have any children of\nmy own, no matter how unhappy I may be, I am not going to let them have\nany cares until they grow up.\n\n(There goes the chapel bell--I'll finish this letter sometime).\n\n\n                                               Thursday\n\nWhen I came in from laboratory this afternoon, I found a squirrel\nsitting on the tea table helping himself to almonds.  These are the\nkind of callers we entertain now that warm weather has come and the\nwindows stay open--\n\n\n                                             Saturday morning\n\nPerhaps you think, last night being Friday, with no classes today, that\nI passed a nice quiet, readable evening with the set of Stevenson that\nI bought with my prize money?  But if so, you've never attended a\ngirls' college, Daddy dear.  Six friends dropped in to make fudge, and\none of them dropped the fudge--while it was still liquid--right in the\nmiddle of our best rug.  We shall never be able to clean up the mess.\n\nI haven't mentioned any lessons of late; but we are still having them\nevery day.  It's sort of a relief though, to get away from them and\ndiscuss life in the large--rather one-sided discussions that you and I\nhold, but that's your own fault.  You are welcome to answer back any\ntime you choose.\n\nI've been writing this letter off and on for three days, and I fear by\nnow vous etes bien bored!\n\n                   Goodbye, nice Mr. Man,\n                                               Judy\n\n\n\n\nMr. Daddy-Long-Legs Smith,\n\nSIR:  Having completed the study of argumentation and the science of\ndividing a thesis into heads, I have decided to adopt the following\nform for letter-writing. It contains all necessary facts, but no\nunnecessary verbiage.\n\nI. We had written examinations this week in:\n       A. Chemistry.\n       B. History.\n\nII.  A new dormitory is being built.\n       A. Its material is:\n           (a) red brick.\n           (b) grey stone.\n       B. Its capacity will be:\n           (a) one dean, five instructors.\n           (b) two hundred girls.\n           (c) one housekeeper, three cooks, twenty waitresses,\n               twenty chambermaids.\n\nIII.  We had junket for dessert tonight.\n\nIV.  I am writing a special topic upon the Sources of Shakespeare's\nPlays.\n\nV. Lou McMahon slipped and fell this afternoon at basket ball, and she:\n       A. Dislocated her shoulder.\n       B. Bruised her knee.\n\nVI.  I have a new hat trimmed with:\n       A. Blue velvet ribbon.\n       B. Two blue quills.\n       C. Three red pompoms.\n\nVII.  It is half past nine.\n\nVIII.  Good night.\n\n                                           Judy\n\n\n\n\n                                               2nd June\n\nDear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\nYou will never guess the nice thing that has happened.\n\nThe McBrides have asked me to spend the summer at their camp in the\nAdirondacks!  They belong to a sort of club on a lovely little lake in\nthe middle of the woods.  The different members have houses made of\nlogs dotted about among the trees, and they go canoeing on the lake,\nand take long walks through trails to other camps, and have dances once\na week in the club house--Jimmie McBride is going to have a college\nfriend visiting him part of the summer, so you see we shall have plenty\nof men to dance with.\n\nWasn't it sweet of Mrs. McBride to ask me?  It appears that she liked\nme when I was there for Christmas.\n\nPlease excuse this being short.  It isn't a real letter; it's just to\nlet you know that I'm disposed of for the summer.\n\n                   Yours,\n                       In a VERY contented frame of mind,\n                                                   Judy\n\n\n\n\n                                                   5th June\n\nDear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\nYour secretary man has just written to me saying that Mr. Smith prefers\nthat I should not accept Mrs. McBride's invitation, but should return\nto Lock Willow the same as last summer.\n\nWhy, why, WHY, Daddy?\n\nYou don't understand about it.  Mrs. McBride does want me, really and\ntruly.  I'm not the least bit of trouble in the house.  I'm a help.\nThey don't take up many servants, and Sallie an I can do lots of useful\nthings.  It's a fine chance for me to learn housekeeping.  Every woman\nought to understand it, and I only know asylum-keeping.\n\nThere aren't any girls our age at the camp, and Mrs. McBride wants me\nfor a companion for Sallie.  We are planning to do a lot of reading\ntogether.  We are going to read all of the books for next year's\nEnglish and sociology.  The Professor said it would be a great help if\nwe would get our reading finished in the summer; and it's so much\neasier to remember it if we read together and talk it over.\n\nJust to live in the same house with Sallie's mother is an education.\nShe's the most interesting, entertaining, companionable, charming woman\nin the world; she knows everything.  Think how many summers I've spent\nwith Mrs. Lippett and how I'll appreciate the contrast.  You needn't be\nafraid that I'll be crowding them, for their house is made of rubber.\nWhen they have a lot of company, they just sprinkle tents about in the\nwoods and turn the boys outside.  It's going to be such a nice, healthy\nsummer exercising out of doors every minute.  Jimmie McBride is going\nto teach me how to ride horseback and paddle a canoe, and how to shoot\nand--oh, lots of things I ought to know.  It's the kind of nice, jolly,\ncare-free time that I've never had; and I think every girl deserves it\nonce in her life.  Of course I'll do exactly as you say, but please,\nPLEASE let me go, Daddy.  I've never wanted anything so much.\n\nThis isn't Jerusha Abbott, the future great author, writing to you.\nIt's just Judy--a girl.\n\n\n\n                                               9th June\n\nMr. John Smith,\n\nSIR:  Yours of the 7th inst. at hand.  In compliance with the\ninstructions received through your secretary, I leave on Friday next to\nspend the summer at Lock Willow Farm.\n\nI hope always to remain,\n                               (Miss) Jerusha Abbott\n\n\n\n\n                                            LOCK WILLOW FARM,\n                                               3rd August\n\nDear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\nIt has been nearly two months since I wrote, which wasn't nice of me, I\nknow, but I haven't loved you much this summer--you see I'm being frank!\n\nYou can't imagine how disappointed I was at having to give up the\nMcBrides' camp.  Of course I know that you're my guardian, and that I\nhave to regard your wishes in all matters, but I couldn't see any\nREASON.  It was so distinctly the best thing that could have happened\nto me.  If I had been Daddy, and you had been Judy, I should have said,\n'Bless you my child, run along and have a good time; see lots of new\npeople and learn lots of new things; live out of doors, and get strong\nand well and rested for a year of hard work.'\n\nBut not at all!  Just a curt line from your secretary ordering me to\nLock Willow.\n\nIt's the impersonality of your commands that hurts my feelings.  It\nseems as though, if you felt the tiniest little bit for me the way I\nfeel for you, you'd sometimes send me a message that you'd written with\nyour own hand, instead of those beastly typewritten secretary's notes.\nIf there were the slightest hint that you cared, I'd do anything on\nearth to please you.\n\nI know that I was to write nice, long, detailed letters without ever\nexpecting any answer.  You're living up to your side of the\nbargain--I'm being educated--and I suppose you're thinking I'm not\nliving up to mine!\n\nBut, Daddy, it is a hard bargain.  It is, really.  I'm so awfully\nlonely.  You are the only person I have to care for, and you are so\nshadowy.  You're just an imaginary man that I've made up--and probably\nthe real YOU isn't a bit like my imaginary YOU.  But you did once, when\nI was ill in the infirmary, send me a message, and now, when I am\nfeeling awfully forgotten, I get out your card and read it over.\n\nI don't think I am telling you at all what I started to say, which was\nthis:\n\nAlthough my feelings are still hurt, for it is very humiliating to be\npicked up and moved about by an arbitrary, peremptory, unreasonable,\nomnipotent, invisible Providence, still, when a man has been as kind\nand generous and thoughtful as you have heretofore been towards me, I\nsuppose he has a right to be an arbitrary, peremptory, unreasonable,\ninvisible Providence if he chooses, and so--I'll forgive you and be\ncheerful again.  But I still don't enjoy getting Sallie's letters about\nthe good times they are having in camp!\n\nHowever--we will draw a veil over that and begin again.\n\nI've been writing and writing this summer; four short stories finished\nand sent to four different magazines.  So you see I'm trying to be an\nauthor.  I have a workroom fixed in a corner of the attic where Master\nJervie used to have his rainy-day playroom.  It's in a cool, breezy\ncorner with two dormer windows, and shaded by a maple tree with a\nfamily of red squirrels living in a hole.\n\nI'll write a nicer letter in a few days and tell you all the farm news.\n\nWe need rain.\n\n                               Yours as ever,\n                                                   Judy\n\n\n\n\n                                               10th August\n\nMr. Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\nSIR:  I address you from the second crotch in the willow tree by the\npool in the pasture.  There's a frog croaking underneath, a locust\nsinging overhead and two little 'devil downheads' darting up and down\nthe trunk.  I've been here for an hour; it's a very comfortable crotch,\nespecially after being upholstered with two sofa cushions.  I came up\nwith a pen and tablet hoping to write an immortal short story, but I've\nbeen having a dreadful time with my heroine--I CAN'T make her behave as\nI want her to behave; so I've abandoned her for the moment, and am\nwriting to you.  (Not much relief though, for I can't make you behave\nas I want you to, either.)\n\nIf you are in that dreadful New York, I wish I could send you some of\nthis lovely, breezy, sunshiny outlook.  The country is Heaven after a\nweek of rain.\n\nSpeaking of Heaven--do you remember Mr. Kellogg that I told you about\nlast summer?--the minister of the little white church at the Corners.\nWell, the poor old soul is dead--last winter of pneumonia.  I went half\na dozen times to hear him preach and got very well acquainted with his\ntheology.  He believed to the end exactly the same things he started\nwith.  It seems to me that a man who can think straight along for\nforty-seven years without changing a single idea ought to be kept in a\ncabinet as a curiosity.  I hope he is enjoying his harp and golden\ncrown; he was so perfectly sure of finding them!  There's a new young\nman, very consequential, in his place.  The congregation is pretty\ndubious, especially the faction led by Deacon Cummings.  It looks as\nthough there was going to be an awful split in the church.  We don't\ncare for innovations in religion in this neighbourhood.\n\nDuring our week of rain I sat up in the attic and had an orgy of\nreading--Stevenson, mostly.  He himself is more entertaining than any\nof the characters in his books; I dare say he made himself into the\nkind of hero that would look well in print.  Don't you think it was\nperfect of him to spend all the ten thousand dollars his father left,\nfor a yacht, and go sailing off to the South Seas?  He lived up to his\nadventurous creed.  If my father had left me ten thousand dollars, I'd\ndo it, too.  The thought of Vailima makes me wild.  I want to see the\ntropics.  I want to see the whole world.  I am going to be a great\nauthor, or artist, or actress, or playwright--or whatever sort of a\ngreat person I turn out to be.  I have a terrible wanderthirst; the\nvery sight of a map makes me want to put on my hat and take an umbrella\nand start.  'I shall see before I die the palms and temples of the\nSouth.'\n\n\n\n                               Thursday evening at twilight,\n                               sitting on the doorstep.\n\nVery hard to get any news into this letter!  Judy is becoming so\nphilosophical of late, that she wishes to discourse largely of the\nworld in general, instead of descending to the trivial details of daily\nlife.  But if you MUST have news, here it is:\n\nOur nine young pigs waded across the brook and ran away last Tuesday,\nand only eight came back.  We don't want to accuse anyone unjustly, but\nwe suspect that Widow Dowd has one more than she ought to have.\n\nMr. Weaver has painted his barn and his two silos a bright pumpkin\nyellow--a very ugly colour, but he says it will wear.\n\nThe Brewers have company this week; Mrs. Brewer's sister and two nieces\nfrom Ohio.\n\nOne of our Rhode Island Reds only brought off three chicks out of\nfifteen eggs.  We can't imagine what was the trouble.  Rhode island\nReds, in my opinion, are a very inferior breed.  I prefer Buff\nOrpingtons.\n\nThe new clerk in the post office at Bonnyrigg Four Corners drank every\ndrop of Jamaica ginger they had in stock--seven dollars' worth--before\nhe was discovered.\n\nOld Ira Hatch has rheumatism and can't work any more; he never saved\nhis money when he was earning good wages, so now he has to live on the\ntown.\n\nThere's to be an ice-cream social at the schoolhouse next Saturday\nevening.  Come and bring your families.\n\nI have a new hat that I bought for twenty-five cents at the post\noffice.  This is my latest portrait, on my way to rake the hay.\n\nIt's getting too dark to see; anyway, the news is all used up.\n\n                               Good night,\n                                               Judy\n\n\n\n\n                                                   Friday\n\nGood morning!  Here is some news!  What do you think?  You'd never,\nnever, never guess who's coming to Lock Willow.  A letter to Mrs.\nSemple from Mr. Pendleton.  He's motoring through the Berkshires, and\nis tired and wants to rest on a nice quiet farm--if he climbs out at\nher doorstep some night will she have a room ready for him?  Maybe\nhe'll stay one week, or maybe two, or maybe three; he'll see how\nrestful it is when he gets here.\n\nSuch a flutter as we are in!  The whole house is being cleaned and all\nthe curtains washed.  I am driving to the Corners this morning to get\nsome new oilcloth for the entry, and two cans of brown floor paint for\nthe hall and back stairs.  Mrs. Dowd is engaged to come tomorrow to\nwash the windows (in the exigency of the moment, we waive our\nsuspicions in regard to the piglet). You might think, from this account\nof our activities, that the house was not already immaculate; but I\nassure you it was!  Whatever Mrs. Semple's limitations, she is a\nHOUSEKEEPER.\n\nBut isn't it just like a man, Daddy?  He doesn't give the remotest hint\nas to whether he will land on the doorstep today, or two weeks from\ntoday.  We shall live in a perpetual breathlessness until he comes--and\nif he doesn't hurry, the cleaning may all have to be done over again.\n\nThere's Amasai waiting below with the buckboard and Grover.  I drive\nalone--but if you could see old Grove, you wouldn't be worried as to my\nsafety.\n\nWith my hand on my heart--farewell.\n\n                                                   Judy\n\n\nPS.  Isn't that a nice ending?  I got it out of Stevenson's letters.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  Saturday\n\nGood morning again!  I didn't get this ENVELOPED yesterday before the\npostman came, so I'll add some more.  We have one mail a day at twelve\no'clock. Rural delivery is a blessing to the farmers!  Our postman not\nonly delivers letters, but he runs errands for us in town, at five\ncents an errand.  Yesterday he brought me some shoe-strings and a jar\nof cold cream (I sunburned all the skin off my nose before I got my new\nhat) and a blue Windsor tie and a bottle of blacking all for ten cents.\nThat was an unusual bargain, owing to the largeness of my order.\n\nAlso he tells us what is happening in the Great World.  Several people\non the route take daily papers, and he reads them as he jogs along, and\nrepeats the news to the ones who don't subscribe.  So in case a war\nbreaks out between the United States and Japan, or the president is\nassassinated, or Mr. Rockefeller leaves a million dollars to the John\nGrier Home, you needn't bother to write; I'll hear it anyway.\n\nNo sign yet of Master Jervie.  But you should see how clean our house\nis--and with what anxiety we wipe our feet before we step in!\n\nI hope he'll come soon; I am longing for someone to talk to.  Mrs.\nSemple, to tell you the truth, gets rather monotonous.  She never lets\nideas interrupt the easy flow of her conversation.  It's a funny thing\nabout the people here.  Their world is just this single hilltop.  They\nare not a bit universal, if you know what I mean.  It's exactly the\nsame as at the John Grier Home.  Our ideas there were bounded by the\nfour sides of the iron fence, only I didn't mind it so much because I\nwas younger, and was so awfully busy.  By the time I'd got all my beds\nmade and my babies' faces washed and had gone to school and come home\nand had washed their faces again and darned their stockings and mended\nFreddie Perkins's trousers (he tore them every day of his life) and\nlearned my lessons in between--I was ready to go to bed, and I didn't\nnotice any lack of social intercourse.  But after two years in a\nconversational college, I do miss it; and I shall be glad to see\nsomebody who speaks my language.\n\nI really believe I've finished, Daddy.  Nothing else occurs to me at\nthe moment--I'll try to write a longer letter next time.\n\n                           Yours always,\n                                           Judy\n\n\nPS.  The lettuce hasn't done at all well this year.  It was so dry\nearly in the season.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   25th August\n\nWell, Daddy, Master Jervie's here.  And such a nice time as we're\nhaving!  At least I am, and I think he is, too--he has been here ten\ndays and he doesn't show any signs of going.  The way Mrs. Semple\npampers that man is scandalous.  If she indulged him as much when he\nwas a baby, I don't know how he ever turned out so well.\n\nHe and I eat at a little table set on the side porch, or sometimes\nunder the trees, or--when it rains or is cold--in the best parlour.  He\njust picks out the spot he wants to eat in and Carrie trots after him\nwith the table.  Then if it has been an awful nuisance, and she has had\nto carry the dishes very far, she finds a dollar under the sugar bowl.\n\nHe is an awfully companionable sort of man, though you would never\nbelieve it to see him casually; he looks at first glance like a true\nPendleton, but he isn't in the least.  He is just as simple and\nunaffected and sweet as he can be--that seems a funny way to describe a\nman, but it's true.  He's extremely nice with the farmers around here;\nhe meets them in a sort of man-to-man fashion that disarms them\nimmediately.  They were very suspicious at first.  They didn't care for\nhis clothes!  And I will say that his clothes are rather amazing.  He\nwears knickerbockers and pleated jackets and white flannels and riding\nclothes with puffed trousers.  Whenever he comes down in anything new,\nMrs. Semple, beaming with pride, walks around and views him from every\nangle, and urges him to be careful where he sits down; she is so afraid\nhe will pick up some dust.  It bores him dreadfully.  He's always\nsaying to her:\n\n'Run along, Lizzie, and tend to your work.  You can't boss me any\nlonger.  I've grown up.'\n\nIt's awfully funny to think of that great big, long-legged man (he's\nnearly as long-legged as you, Daddy) ever sitting in Mrs. Semple's lap\nand having his face washed.  Particularly funny when you see her lap!\nShe has two laps now, and three chins.  But he says that once she was\nthin and wiry and spry and could run faster than he.\n\nSuch a lot of adventures we're having!  We've explored the country for\nmiles, and I've learned to fish with funny little flies made of\nfeathers.  Also to shoot with a rifle and a revolver.  Also to ride\nhorseback--there's an astonishing amount of life in old Grove.  We fed\nhim on oats for three days, and he shied at a calf and almost ran away\nwith me.\n\n                                                   Wednesday\n\nWe climbed Sky Hill Monday afternoon.  That's a mountain near here; not\nan awfully high mountain, perhaps--no snow on the summit--but at least\nyou are pretty breathless when you reach the top.  The lower slopes are\ncovered with woods, but the top is just piled rocks and open moor.  We\nstayed up for the sunset and built a fire and cooked our supper.\nMaster Jervie did the cooking; he said he knew how better than me and\nhe did, too, because he's used to camping.  Then we came down by\nmoonlight, and, when we reached the wood trail where it was dark, by\nthe light of an electric bulb that he had in his pocket.  It was such\nfun!  He laughed and joked all the way and talked about interesting\nthings.  He's read all the books I've ever read, and a lot of others\nbesides.  It's astonishing how many different things he knows.\n\nWe went for a long tramp this morning and got caught in a storm.  Our\nclothes were drenched before we reached home but our spirits not even\ndamp.  You should have seen Mrs. Semple's face when we dripped into her\nkitchen.\n\n'Oh, Master Jervie--Miss Judy!  You are soaked through.  Dear!  Dear!\nWhat shall I do?  That nice new coat is perfectly ruined.'\n\nShe was awfully funny; you would have thought that we were ten years\nold, and she a distracted mother.  I was afraid for a while that we\nweren't going to get any jam for tea.\n\n\n\n                                                   Saturday\n\nI started this letter ages ago, but I haven't had a second to finish it.\n\nIsn't this a nice thought from Stevenson?\n\n\n           The world is so full of a number of things,\n           I am sure we should all be as happy as kings.\n\n\nIt's true, you know.  The world is full of happiness, and plenty to go\nround, if you are only willing to take the kind that comes your way.\nThe whole secret is in being PLIABLE.  In the country, especially,\nthere are such a lot of entertaining things.  I can walk over\neverybody's land, and look at everybody's view, and dabble in\neverybody's brook; and enjoy it just as much as though I owned the\nland--and with no taxes to pay!\n\nIt's Sunday night now, about eleven o'clock, and I am supposed to be\ngetting some beauty sleep, but I had black coffee for dinner, so--no\nbeauty sleep for me!\n\nThis morning, said Mrs. Semple to Mr. Pendleton, with a very determined\naccent:\n\n'We have to leave here at a quarter past ten in order to get to church\nby eleven.'\n\n'Very well, Lizzie,' said Master Jervie, 'you have the buggy ready, and\nif I'm not dressed, just go on without waiting.'  'We'll wait,' said\nshe.\n\n'As you please,' said he, 'only don't keep the horses standing too\nlong.'\n\nThen while she was dressing, he told Carrie to pack up a lunch, and he\ntold me to scramble into my walking clothes; and we slipped out the\nback way and went fishing.\n\nIt discommoded the household dreadfully, because Lock Willow of a\nSunday dines at two.  But he ordered dinner at seven--he orders meals\nwhenever he chooses; you would think the place were a restaurant--and\nthat kept Carrie and Amasai from going driving.  But he said it was all\nthe better because it wasn't proper for them to go driving without a\nchaperon; and anyway, he wanted the horses himself to take me driving.\nDid you ever hear anything so funny?\n\nAnd poor Mrs. Semple believes that people who go fishing on Sundays go\nafterwards to a sizzling hot hell!  She is awfully troubled to think\nthat she didn't train him better when he was small and helpless and she\nhad the chance.  Besides--she wished to show him off in church.\n\nAnyway, we had our fishing (he caught four little ones) and we cooked\nthem on a camp-fire for lunch.  They kept falling off our spiked sticks\ninto the fire, so they tasted a little ashy, but we ate them.  We got\nhome at four and went driving at five and had dinner at seven, and at\nten I was sent to bed and here I am, writing to you.\n\nI am getting a little sleepy, though.\n\n                                       Good night.\n\n\nHere is a picture of the one fish I caught.\n\n\n\n\nShip Ahoy, Cap'n Long-Legs!\n\nAvast!  Belay!  Yo, ho, ho, and a bottle of rum.  Guess what I'm\nreading?  Our conversation these past two days has been nautical and\npiratical.  Isn't Treasure Island fun?  Did you ever read it, or wasn't\nit written when you were a boy?  Stevenson only got thirty pounds for\nthe serial rights--I don't believe it pays to be a great author.  Maybe\nI'll be a school-teacher.\n\nExcuse me for filling my letters so full of Stevenson; my mind is very\nmuch engaged with him at present.  He comprises Lock Willow's library.\n\nI've been writing this letter for two weeks, and I think it's about\nlong enough.  Never say, Daddy, that I don't give details.  I wish you\nwere here, too; we'd all have such a jolly time together.  I like my\ndifferent friends to know each other.  I wanted to ask Mr. Pendleton if\nhe knew you in New York--I should think he might; you must move in\nabout the same exalted social circles, and you are both interested in\nreforms and things--but I couldn't, for I don't know your real name.\n\nIt's the silliest thing I ever heard of, not to know your name.  Mrs.\nLippett warned me that you were eccentric.  I should think so!\n\n                           Affectionately,\n                                               Judy\n\n\nPS.  On reading this over, I find that it isn't all Stevenson.  There\nare one or two glancing references to Master Jervie.\n\n\n\n\n                                               10th September\n\nDear Daddy,\n\nHe has gone, and we are missing him!  When you get accustomed to people\nor places or ways of living, and then have them snatched away, it does\nleave an awfully empty, gnawing sort of sensation.  I'm finding Mrs.\nSemple's conversation pretty unseasoned food.\n\nCollege opens in two weeks and I shall be glad to begin work again.  I\nhave worked quite a lot this summer though--six short stories and seven\npoems.  Those I sent to the magazines all came back with the most\ncourteous promptitude.  But I don't mind.  It's good practice.  Master\nJervie read them--he brought in the post, so I couldn't help his\nknowing--and he said they were DREADFUL.  They showed that I didn't\nhave the slightest idea of what I was talking about.  (Master Jervie\ndoesn't let politeness interfere with truth.) But the last one I\ndid--just a little sketch laid in college--he said wasn't bad; and he\nhad it typewritten, and I sent it to a magazine.  They've had it two\nweeks; maybe they're thinking it over.\n\nYou should see the sky!  There's the queerest orange-coloured light\nover everything.  We're going to have a storm.\n\n\nIt commenced just that moment with tremendously big drops and all the\nshutters banging.  I had to run to close the windows, while Carrie flew\nto the attic with an armful of milk pans to put under the places where\nthe roof leaks and then, just as I was resuming my pen, I remembered\nthat I'd left a cushion and rug and hat and Matthew Arnold's poems\nunder a tree in the orchard, so I dashed out to get them, all quite\nsoaked.  The red cover of the poems had run into the inside; Dover\nBeach in the future will be washed by pink waves.\n\nA storm is awfully disturbing in the country.  You are always having to\nthink of so many things that are out of doors and getting spoiled.\n\n                                                   Thursday\n\nDaddy!  Daddy!  What do you think?  The postman has just come with two\nletters.\n\n1st.  My story is accepted.  $50.\n\nALORS!  I'm an AUTHOR.\n\n2nd.  A letter from the college secretary.  I'm to have a scholarship\nfor two years that will cover board and tuition.  It was founded for\n'marked proficiency in English with general excellency in other lines.'\nAnd I've won it!  I applied for it before I left, but I didn't have an\nidea I'd get it, on account of my Freshman bad work in maths and Latin.\nBut it seems I've made it up.  I am awfully glad, Daddy, because now I\nwon't be such a burden to you.  The monthly allowance will be all I'll\nneed, and maybe I can earn that with writing or tutoring or something.\n\nI'm LONGING to go back and begin work.\n\n                   Yours ever,\n                                           Jerusha Abbott,\n\n                               Author of When the Sophomores Won\n                               the Game.  For sale at all news\n                               stands, price ten cents.\n\n\n\n\n                                               26th September\n\nDear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\nBack at college again and an upper classman.  Our study is better than\never this year--faces the South with two huge windows and oh!  so\nfurnished.  Julia, with an unlimited allowance, arrived two days early\nand was attacked with a fever for settling.\n\nWe have new wall paper and oriental rugs and mahogany chairs--not\npainted mahogany which made us sufficiently happy last year, but real.\nIt's very gorgeous, but I don't feel as though I belonged in it; I'm\nnervous all the time for fear I'll get an ink spot in the wrong place.\n\nAnd, Daddy, I found your letter waiting for me--pardon--I mean your\nsecretary's.\n\nWill you kindly convey to me a comprehensible reason why I should not\naccept that scholarship?  I don't understand your objection in the\nleast.  But anyway, it won't do the slightest good for you to object,\nfor I've already accepted it and I am not going to change!  That sounds\na little impertinent, but I don't mean it so.\n\nI suppose you feel that when you set out to educate me, you'd like to\nfinish the work, and put a neat period, in the shape of a diploma, at\nthe end.\n\nBut look at it just a second from my point of view.  I shall owe my\neducation to you just as much as though I let you pay for the whole of\nit, but I won't be quite so much indebted.  I know that you don't want\nme to return the money, but nevertheless, I am going to want to do it,\nif I possibly can; and winning this scholarship makes it so much\neasier.  I was expecting to spend the rest of my life in paying my\ndebts, but now I shall only have to spend one-half of the rest of it.\n\nI hope you understand my position and won't be cross.  The allowance I\nshall still most gratefully accept.  It requires an allowance to live\nup to Julia and her furniture!  I wish that she had been reared to\nsimpler tastes, or else that she were not my room-mate.\n\nThis isn't much of a letter; I meant to have written a lot--but I've\nbeen hemming four window curtains and three portieres (I'm glad you\ncan't see the length of the stitches), and polishing a brass desk set\nwith tooth powder (very uphill work), and sawing off picture wire with\nmanicure scissors, and unpacking four boxes of books, and putting away\ntwo trunkfuls of clothes (it doesn't seem believable that Jerusha\nAbbott owns two trunks full of clothes, but she does!) and welcoming\nback fifty dear friends in between.\n\nOpening day is a joyous occasion!\n\nGood night, Daddy dear, and don't be annoyed because your chick is\nwanting to scratch for herself.  She's growing up into an awfully\nenergetic little hen--with a very determined cluck and lots of\nbeautiful feathers (all due to you).\n\n                           Affectionately,\n                                               Judy\n\n\n\n\n                                               30th September\n\nDear Daddy,\n\nAre you still harping on that scholarship?  I never knew a man so\nobstinate, and stubborn and unreasonable, and tenacious, and\nbull-doggish, and unable-to-see-other-people's-point-of-view, as you.\n\nYou prefer that I should not be accepting favours from strangers.\n\nStrangers!--And what are you, pray?\n\nIs there anyone in the world that I know less?  I shouldn't recognize\nyou if I met you in the street.  Now, you see, if you had been a sane,\nsensible person and had written nice, cheering fatherly letters to your\nlittle Judy, and had come occasionally and patted her on the head, and\nhad said you were glad she was such a good girl--Then, perhaps, she\nwouldn't have flouted you in your old age, but would have obeyed your\nslightest wish like the dutiful daughter she was meant to be.\n\nStrangers indeed!  You live in a glass house, Mr. Smith.\n\nAnd besides, this isn't a favour; it's like a prize--I earned it by\nhard work.  If nobody had been good enough in English, the committee\nwouldn't have awarded the scholarship; some years they don't. Also--\nBut what's the use of arguing with a man?  You belong, Mr. Smith, to a\nsex devoid of a sense of logic.  To bring a man into line, there are\njust two methods:  one must either coax or be disagreeable.  I scorn to\ncoax men for what I wish.  Therefore, I must be disagreeable.\n\nI refuse, sir, to give up the scholarship; and if you make any more\nfuss, I won't accept the monthly allowance either, but will wear myself\ninto a nervous wreck tutoring stupid Freshmen.\n\nThat is my ultimatum!\n\nAnd listen--I have a further thought.  Since you are so afraid that by\ntaking this scholarship I am depriving someone else of an education, I\nknow a way out.  You can apply the money that you would have spent for\nme towards educating some other little girl from the John Grier Home.\nDon't you think that's a nice idea?  Only, Daddy, EDUCATE the new girl\nas much as you choose, but please don't LIKE her any better than me.\n\nI trust that your secretary won't be hurt because I pay so little\nattention to the suggestions offered in his letter, but I can't help it\nif he is.  He's a spoiled child, Daddy.  I've meekly given in to his\nwhims heretofore, but this time I intend to be FIRM.\n\nYours,\n       With a mind,\n           Completely and Irrevocably and\n               World-without-End Made-up,\n\n                                        Jerusha Abbott\n\n\n\n\n                                                   9th November\n\nDear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\nI started down town today to buy a bottle of shoe blacking and some\ncollars and the material for a new blouse and a jar of violet cream and\na cake of Castile soap--all very necessary; I couldn't be happy another\nday without them--and when I tried to pay the car fare, I found that I\nhad left my purse in the pocket of my other coat.  So I had to get out\nand take the next car, and was late for gymnasium.\n\nIt's a dreadful thing to have no memory and two coats!\n\nJulia Pendleton has invited me to visit her for the Christmas holidays.\nHow does that strike you, Mr. Smith?  Fancy Jerusha Abbott, of the John\nGrier Home, sitting at the tables of the rich.  I don't know why Julia\nwants me--she seems to be getting quite attached to me of late.  I\nshould, to tell the truth, very much prefer going to Sallie's, but\nJulia asked me first, so if I go anywhere it must be to New York\ninstead of to Worcester.  I'm rather awed at the prospect of meeting\nPendletons EN MASSE, and also I'd have to get a lot of new clothes--so,\nDaddy dear, if you write that you would prefer having me remain quietly\nat college, I will bow to your wishes with my usual sweet docility.\n\nI'm engaged at odd moments with the Life and Letters of Thomas\nHuxley--it makes nice, light reading to pick up between times.  Do you\nknow what an archaeopteryx is?  It's a bird.  And a stereognathus?  I'm\nnot sure myself, but I think it's a missing link, like a bird with\nteeth or a lizard with wings.  No, it isn't either; I've just looked in\nthe book.  It's a mesozoic mammal.\n\nI've elected economics this year--very illuminating subject.  When I\nfinish that I'm going to take Charity and Reform; then, Mr. Trustee,\nI'll know just how an orphan asylum ought to be run.  Don't you think\nI'd make an admirable voter if I had my rights?  I was twenty-one last\nweek.  This is an awfully wasteful country to throw away such an\nhonest, educated, conscientious, intelligent citizen as I would be.\n\n                           Yours always,\n                                               Judy\n\n\n\n\n                                               7th December\n\nDear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\nThank you for permission to visit Julia--I take it that silence means\nconsent.\n\nSuch a social whirl as we've been having!  The Founder's dance came\nlast week--this was the first year that any of us could attend; only\nupper classmen being allowed.\n\nI invited Jimmie McBride, and Sallie invited his room-mate at\nPrinceton, who visited them last summer at their camp--an awfully nice\nman with red hair--and Julia invited a man from New York, not very\nexciting, but socially irreproachable.  He is connected with the De la\nMater Chichesters.  Perhaps that means something to you?  It doesn't\nilluminate me to any extent.\n\nHowever--our guests came Friday afternoon in time for tea in the senior\ncorridor, and then dashed down to the hotel for dinner.  The hotel was\nso full that they slept in rows on the billiard tables, they say.\nJimmie McBride says that the next time he is bidden to a social event\nin this college, he is going to bring one of their Adirondack tents and\npitch it on the campus.\n\nAt seven-thirty they came back for the President's reception and dance.\nOur functions commence early!  We had the men's cards all made out\nahead of time, and after every dance, we'd leave them in groups, under\nthe letter that stood for their names, so that they could be readily\nfound by their next partners.  Jimmie McBride, for example, would stand\npatiently under 'M' until he was claimed.  (At least, he ought to have\nstood patiently, but he kept wandering off and getting mixed with 'R's'\nand 'S's' and all sorts of letters.) I found him a very difficult\nguest; he was sulky because he had only three dances with me.  He said\nhe was bashful about dancing with girls he didn't know!\n\nThe next morning we had a glee club concert--and who do you think wrote\nthe funny new song composed for the occasion?  It's the truth.  She\ndid.  Oh, I tell you, Daddy, your little foundling is getting to be\nquite a prominent person!\n\nAnyway, our gay two days were great fun, and I think the men enjoyed\nit.  Some of them were awfully perturbed at first at the prospect of\nfacing one thousand girls; but they got acclimated very quickly.  Our\ntwo Princeton men had a beautiful time--at least they politely said\nthey had, and they've invited us to their dance next spring.  We've\naccepted, so please don't object, Daddy dear.\n\nJulia and Sallie and I all had new dresses.  Do you want to hear about\nthem?  Julia's was cream satin and gold embroidery and she wore purple\norchids.  It was a DREAM and came from Paris, and cost a million\ndollars.\n\nSallie's was pale blue trimmed with Persian embroidery, and went\nbeautifully with red hair.  It didn't cost quite a million, but was\njust as effective as Julia's.\n\nMine was pale pink crepe de chine trimmed with ecru lace and rose\nsatin.  And I carried crimson roses which J. McB.  sent (Sallie having\ntold him what colour to get). And we all had satin slippers and silk\nstockings and chiffon scarfs to match.\n\nYou must be deeply impressed by these millinery details.\n\nOne can't help thinking, Daddy, what a colourless life a man is forced\nto lead, when one reflects that chiffon and Venetian point and hand\nembroidery and Irish crochet are to him mere empty words.  Whereas a\nwoman--whether she is interested in babies or microbes or husbands or\npoetry or servants or parallelograms or gardens or Plato or bridge--is\nfundamentally and always interested in clothes.\n\nIt's the one touch of nature that makes the whole world kin.  (That\nisn't original.  I got it out of one of Shakespeare's plays).\n\nHowever, to resume.  Do you want me to tell you a secret that I've\nlately discovered?  And will you promise not to think me vain?  Then\nlisten:\n\nI'm pretty.\n\nI am, really.  I'd be an awful idiot not to know it with three\nlooking-glasses in the room.\n\n                                           A Friend\n\n\nPS.  This is one of those wicked anonymous letters you read about in\nnovels.\n\n\n\n                                               20th December\n\nDear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\nI've just a moment, because I must attend two classes, pack a trunk and\na suit-case, and catch the four-o'clock train--but I couldn't go\nwithout sending a word to let you know how much I appreciate my\nChristmas box.\n\nI love the furs and the necklace and the Liberty scarf and the gloves\nand handkerchiefs and books and purse--and most of all I love you!  But\nDaddy, you have no business to spoil me this way.  I'm only human--and\na girl at that.  How can I keep my mind sternly fixed on a studious\ncareer, when you deflect me with such worldly frivolities?\n\nI have strong suspicions now as to which one of the John Grier Trustees\nused to give the Christmas tree and the Sunday ice-cream.  He was\nnameless, but by his works I know him!  You deserve to be happy for all\nthe good things you do.\n\nGoodbye, and a very merry Christmas.\n\n                               Yours always,\n                                               Judy\n\n\nPS.  I am sending a slight token, too.  Do you think you would like her\nif you knew her?\n\n\n\n\n                                               11th January\n\nI meant to write to you from the city, Daddy, but New York is an\nengrossing place.\n\nI had an interesting--and illuminating--time, but I'm glad I don't\nbelong to such a family!  I should truly rather have the John Grier\nHome for a background.  Whatever the drawbacks of my bringing up, there\nwas at least no pretence about it.  I know now what people mean when\nthey say they are weighed down by Things.  The material atmosphere of\nthat house was crushing; I didn't draw a deep breath until I was on an\nexpress train coming back.  All the furniture was carved and\nupholstered and gorgeous; the people I met were beautifully dressed and\nlow-voiced and well-bred, but it's the truth, Daddy, I never heard one\nword of real talk from the time we arrived until we left.  I don't\nthink an idea ever entered the front door.\n\nMrs. Pendleton never thinks of anything but jewels and dressmakers and\nsocial engagements.  She did seem a different kind of mother from Mrs.\nMcBride!  If I ever marry and have a family, I'm going to make them as\nexactly like the McBrides as I can.  Not for all the money in the world\nwould I ever let any children of mine develop into Pendletons.  Maybe\nit isn't polite to criticize people you've been visiting?  If it isn't,\nplease excuse.  This is very confidential, between you and me.\n\nI only saw Master Jervie once when he called at tea time, and then I\ndidn't have a chance to speak to him alone.  It was really\ndisappointing after our nice time last summer.  I don't think he cares\nmuch for his relatives--and I am sure they don't care much for him!\nJulia's mother says he's unbalanced.  He's a Socialist--except, thank\nHeaven, he doesn't let his hair grow and wear red ties.  She can't\nimagine where he picked up his queer ideas; the family have been Church\nof England for generations.  He throws away his money on every sort of\ncrazy reform, instead of spending it on such sensible things as yachts\nand automobiles and polo ponies.  He does buy candy with it though!  He\nsent Julia and me each a box for Christmas.\n\nYou know, I think I'll be a Socialist, too.  You wouldn't mind, would\nyou, Daddy?  They're quite different from Anarchists; they don't\nbelieve in blowing people up.  Probably I am one by rights; I belong to\nthe proletariat.  I haven't determined yet just which kind I am going\nto be.  I will look into the subject over Sunday, and declare my\nprinciples in my next.\n\nI've seen loads of theatres and hotels and beautiful houses.  My mind\nis a confused jumble of onyx and gilding and mosaic floors and palms.\nI'm still pretty breathless but I am glad to get back to college and my\nbooks--I believe that I really am a student; this atmosphere of\nacademic calm I find more bracing than New York.  College is a very\nsatisfying sort of life; the books and study and regular classes keep\nyou alive mentally, and then when your mind gets tired, you have the\ngymnasium and outdoor athletics, and always plenty of congenial friends\nwho are thinking about the same things you are.  We spend a whole\nevening in nothing but talk--talk--talk--and go to bed with a very\nuplifted feeling, as though we had settled permanently some pressing\nworld problems.  And filling in every crevice, there is always such a\nlot of nonsense--just silly jokes about the little things that come up\nbut very satisfying.  We do appreciate our own witticisms!\n\nIt isn't the great big pleasures that count the most; it's making a\ngreat deal out of the little ones--I've discovered the true secret of\nhappiness, Daddy, and that is to live in the now.  Not to be for ever\nregretting the past, or anticipating the future; but to get the most\nthat you can out of this very instant.  It's like farming.  You can\nhave extensive farming and intensive farming; well, I am going to have\nintensive living after this.  I'm going to enjoy every second, and I'm\ngoing to KNOW I'm enjoying it while I'm enjoying it.  Most people don't\nlive; they just race.  They are trying to reach some goal far away on\nthe horizon, and in the heat of the going they get so breathless and\npanting that they lose all sight of the beautiful, tranquil country\nthey are passing through; and then the first thing they know, they are\nold and worn out, and it doesn't make any difference whether they've\nreached the goal or not.  I've decided to sit down by the way and pile\nup a lot of little happinesses, even if I never become a Great Author.\nDid you ever know such a philosopheress as I am developing into?\n\n                                   Yours ever,\n                                                   Judy\n\nPS.  It's raining cats and dogs tonight.  Two puppies and a kitten have\njust landed on the window-sill.\n\n\n\n\nDear Comrade,\n\nHooray!  I'm a Fabian.\n\nThat's a Socialist who's willing to wait.  We don't want the social\nrevolution to come tomorrow morning; it would be too upsetting.  We\nwant it to come very gradually in the distant future, when we shall all\nbe prepared and able to sustain the shock.\n\nIn the meantime, we must be getting ready, by instituting industrial,\neducational and orphan asylum reforms.\n\n               Yours, with fraternal love,\n                                               Judy\n\nMonday, 3rd hour\n\n\n\n\n                                                   11th February\nDear D.-L.-L.,\n\nDon't be insulted because this is so short.  It isn't a letter; it's\njust a LINE to say that I'm going to write a letter pretty soon when\nexaminations are over.  It is not only necessary that I pass, but pass\nWELL.  I have a scholarship to live up to.\n\n                       Yours, studying hard,\n                                               J. A.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   5th March\n\nDear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\nPresident Cuyler made a speech this evening about the modern generation\nbeing flippant and superficial.  He says that we are losing the old\nideals of earnest endeavour and true scholarship; and particularly is\nthis falling-off noticeable in our disrespectful attitude towards\norganized authority.  We no longer pay a seemly deference to our\nsuperiors.\n\nI came away from chapel very sober.\n\nAm I too familiar, Daddy?  Ought I to treat you with more dignity and\naloofness?--Yes, I'm sure I ought.  I'll begin again.\n\nMy Dear Mr. Smith,\n\nYou will be pleased to hear that I passed successfully my mid-year\nexaminations, and am now commencing work in the new semester.  I am\nleaving chemistry--having completed the course in qualitative\nanalysis--and am entering upon the study of biology.  I approach this\nsubject with some hesitation, as I understand that we dissect\nangleworms and frogs.\n\nAn extremely interesting and valuable lecture was given in the chapel\nlast week upon Roman Remains in Southern France.  I have never listened\nto a more illuminating exposition of the subject.\n\nWe are reading Wordsworth's Tintern Abbey in connection with our course\nin English Literature.  What an exquisite work it is, and how\nadequately it embodies his conceptions of Pantheism!  The Romantic\nmovement of the early part of the last century, exemplified in the\nworks of such poets as Shelley, Byron, Keats, and Wordsworth, appeals\nto me very much more than the Classical period that preceded it.\nSpeaking of poetry, have you ever read that charming little thing of\nTennyson's called Locksley Hall?\n\nI am attending gymnasium very regularly of late.  A proctor system has\nbeen devised, and failure to comply with the rules causes a great deal\nof inconvenience.  The gymnasium is equipped with a very beautiful\nswimming tank of cement and marble, the gift of a former graduate.  My\nroom-mate, Miss McBride, has given me her bathing-suit (it shrank so\nthat she can no longer wear it) and I am about to begin swimming\nlessons.\n\nWe had delicious pink ice-cream for dessert last night.  Only vegetable\ndyes are used in colouring the food.  The college is very much opposed,\nboth from aesthetic and hygienic motives, to the use of aniline dyes.\n\nThe weather of late has been ideal--bright sunshine and clouds\ninterspersed with a few welcome snow-storms. I and my companions have\nenjoyed our walks to and from classes--particularly from.\n\nTrusting, my dear Mr. Smith, that this will find you in your usual good\nhealth,\n\n           I remain,\n               Most cordially yours,\n                                      Jerusha Abbott\n\n\n\n\n                                               24th April\n\nDear Daddy,\n\nSpring has come again!  You should see how lovely the campus is.  I\nthink you might come and look at it for yourself.  Master Jervie\ndropped in again last Friday--but he chose a most unpropitious time,\nfor Sallie and Julia and I were just running to catch a train.  And\nwhere do you think we were going?  To Princeton, to attend a dance and\na ball game, if you please!  I didn't ask you if I might go, because I\nhad a feeling that your secretary would say no.  But it was entirely\nregular; we had leave-of-absence from college, and Mrs. McBride\nchaperoned us.  We had a charming time--but I shall have to omit\ndetails; they are too many and complicated.\n\n\n                                                       Saturday\n\nUp before dawn!  The night watchman called us--six of us--and we made\ncoffee in a chafing dish (you never saw so many grounds!) and walked\ntwo miles to the top of One Tree Hill to see the sun rise.  We had to\nscramble up the last slope!  The sun almost beat us!  And perhaps you\nthink we didn't bring back appetites to breakfast!\n\nDear me, Daddy, I seem to have a very ejaculatory style today; this\npage is peppered with exclamations.\n\nI meant to have written a lot about the budding trees and the new\ncinder path in the athletic field, and the awful lesson we have in\nbiology for tomorrow, and the new canoes on the lake, and Catherine\nPrentiss who has pneumonia, and Prexy's Angora kitten that strayed from\nhome and has been boarding in Fergussen Hall for two weeks until a\nchambermaid reported it, and about my three new dresses--white and pink\nand blue polka dots with a hat to match--but I am too sleepy.  I am\nalways making this an excuse, am I not?  But a girls' college is a busy\nplace and we do get tired by the end of the day!  Particularly when the\nday begins at dawn.\n\n                           Affectionately,\n                                               Judy\n\n\n\n\n                                                   15th May\n\nDear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\nIs it good manners when you get into a car just to stare straight ahead\nand not see anybody else?\n\nA very beautiful lady in a very beautiful velvet dress got into the car\ntoday, and without the slightest expression sat for fifteen minutes and\nlooked at a sign advertising suspenders.  It doesn't seem polite to\nignore everybody else as though you were the only important person\npresent.  Anyway, you miss a lot.  While she was absorbing that silly\nsign, I was studying a whole car full of interesting human beings.\n\nThe accompanying illustration is hereby reproduced for the first time.\nIt looks like a spider on the end of a string, but it isn't at all;\nit's a picture of me learning to swim in the tank in the gymnasium.\n\nThe instructor hooks a rope into a ring in the back of my belt, and\nruns it through a pulley in the ceiling.  It would be a beautiful\nsystem if one had perfect confidence in the probity of one's\ninstructor.  I'm always afraid, though, that she will let the rope get\nslack, so I keep one anxious eye on her and swim with the other, and\nwith this divided interest I do not make the progress that I otherwise\nmight.\n\nVery miscellaneous weather we're having of late.  It was raining when I\ncommenced and now the sun is shining.  Sallie and I are going out to\nplay tennis--thereby gaining exemption from Gym.\n\n\n                                           A week later\n\nI should have finished this letter long ago, but I didn't. You don't\nmind, do you, Daddy, if I'm not very regular?  I really do love to\nwrite to you; it gives me such a respectable feeling of having some\nfamily.  Would you like me to tell you something?  You are not the only\nman to whom I write letters.  There are two others!  I have been\nreceiving beautiful long letters this winter from Master Jervie (with\ntypewritten envelopes so Julia won't recognize the writing). Did you\never hear anything so shocking?  And every week or so a very scrawly\nepistle, usually on yellow tablet paper, arrives from Princeton.  All\nof which I answer with business-like promptness.  So you see--I am not\nso different from other girls--I get letters, too.\n\nDid I tell you that I have been elected a member of the Senior Dramatic\nClub?  Very recherche organization.  Only seventy-five members out of\none thousand.  Do you think as a consistent Socialist that I ought to\nbelong?\n\nWhat do you suppose is at present engaging my attention in sociology?\nI am writing (figurez vous!) a paper on the Care of Dependent Children.\nThe Professor shuffled up his subjects and dealt them out\npromiscuously, and that fell to me.  C'est drole ca n'est pas?\n\nThere goes the gong for dinner.  I'll post this as I pass the box.\n\n                                   Affectionately,\n                                                       J.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   4th June\n\nDear Daddy,\n\nVery busy time--commencement in ten days, examinations tomorrow; lots\nof studying, lots of packing, and the outdoor world so lovely that it\nhurts you to stay inside.\n\nBut never mind, vacation's coming.  Julia is going abroad this\nsummer--it makes the fourth time.  No doubt about it, Daddy, goods are\nnot distributed evenly.  Sallie, as usual, goes to the Adirondacks.\nAnd what do you think I am going to do?  You may have three guesses.\nLock Willow?  Wrong.  The Adirondacks with Sallie?  Wrong.  (I'll never\nattempt that again; I was discouraged last year.) Can't you guess\nanything else?  You're not very inventive.  I'll tell you, Daddy, if\nyou'll promise not to make a lot of objections.  I warn your secretary\nin advance that my mind is made up.\n\nI am going to spend the summer at the seaside with a Mrs. Charles\nPaterson and tutor her daughter who is to enter college in the autumn.\nI met her through the McBrides, and she is a very charming woman.  I am\nto give lessons in English and Latin to the younger daughter, too, but\nI shall have a little time to myself, and I shall be earning fifty\ndollars a month!  Doesn't that impress you as a perfectly exorbitant\namount?  She offered it; I should have blushed to ask for more than\ntwenty-five.\n\nI finish at Magnolia (that's where she lives) the first of September,\nand shall probably spend the remaining three weeks at Lock Willow--I\nshould like to see the Semples again and all the friendly animals.\n\nHow does my programme strike you, Daddy?  I am getting quite\nindependent, you see.  You have put me on my feet and I think I can\nalmost walk alone by now.\n\nPrinceton commencement and our examinations exactly coincide--which is\nan awful blow.  Sallie and I did so want to get away in time for it,\nbut of course that is utterly impossible.\n\nGoodbye, Daddy.  Have a nice summer and come back in the autumn rested\nand ready for another year of work.  (That's what you ought to be\nwriting to me!) I haven't any idea what you do in the summer, or how\nyou amuse yourself.  I can't visualize your surroundings.  Do you play\ngolf or hunt or ride horseback or just sit in the sun and meditate?\n\nAnyway, whatever it is, have a good time and don't forget Judy.\n\n\n\n\n                                                       10th June\n\nDear Daddy,\n\nThis is the hardest letter I ever wrote, but I have decided what I must\ndo, and there isn't going to be any turning back.  It is very sweet and\ngenerous and dear of you to wish to send me to Europe this summer--for\nthe moment I was intoxicated by the idea; but sober second thoughts\nsaid no.  It would be rather illogical of me to refuse to take your\nmoney for college, and then use it instead just for amusement!  You\nmustn't get me used to too many luxuries.  One doesn't miss what one\nhas never had; but it's awfully hard going without things after one has\ncommenced thinking they are his--hers (English language needs another\npronoun) by natural right.  Living with Sallie and Julia is an awful\nstrain on my stoical philosophy.  They have both had things from the\ntime they were babies; they accept happiness as a matter of course.\nThe World, they think, owes them everything they want.  Maybe the World\ndoes--in any case, it seems to acknowledge the debt and pay up.  But as\nfor me, it owes me nothing, and distinctly told me so in the beginning.\nI have no right to borrow on credit, for there will come a time when\nthe World will repudiate my claim.\n\nI seem to be floundering in a sea of metaphor--but I hope you grasp my\nmeaning?  Anyway, I have a very strong feeling that the only honest\nthing for me to do is to teach this summer and begin to support myself.\n\n\n\n                                       MAGNOLIA,\n                                               Four days later\n\nI'd got just that much written, when--what do you think happened?  The\nmaid arrived with Master Jervie's card.  He is going abroad too this\nsummer; not with Julia and her family, but entirely by himself I told\nhim that you had invited me to go with a lady who is chaperoning a\nparty of girls.  He knows about you, Daddy.  That is, he knows that my\nfather and mother are dead, and that a kind gentleman is sending me to\ncollege; I simply didn't have the courage to tell him about the John\nGrier Home and all the rest.  He thinks that you are my guardian and a\nperfectly legitimate old family friend.  I have never told him that I\ndidn't know you--that would seem too queer!\n\nAnyway, he insisted on my going to Europe.  He said that it was a\nnecessary part of my education and that I mustn't think of refusing.\nAlso, that he would be in Paris at the same time, and that we would run\naway from the chaperon occasionally and have dinner together at nice,\nfunny, foreign restaurants.\n\nWell, Daddy, it did appeal to me!  I almost weakened; if he hadn't been\nso dictatorial, maybe I should have entirely weakened.  I can be\nenticed step by step, but I WON'T be forced.  He said I was a silly,\nfoolish, irrational, quixotic, idiotic, stubborn child (those are a few\nof his abusive adjectives; the rest escape me), and that I didn't know\nwhat was good for me; I ought to let older people judge.  We almost\nquarrelled--I am not sure but that we entirely did!\n\nIn any case, I packed my trunk fast and came up here.  I thought I'd\nbetter see my bridges in flames behind me before I finished writing to\nyou.  They are entirely reduced to ashes now.  Here I am at Cliff Top\n(the name of Mrs. Paterson's cottage) with my trunk unpacked and\nFlorence (the little one) already struggling with first declension\nnouns.  And it bids fair to be a struggle!  She is a most uncommonly\nspoiled child; I shall have to teach her first how to study--she has\nnever in her life concentrated on anything more difficult than\nice-cream soda water.\n\nWe use a quiet corner of the cliffs for a schoolroom--Mrs. Paterson\nwishes me to keep them out of doors--and I will say that I find it\ndifficult to concentrate with the blue sea before me and ships\na-sailing by!  And when I think I might be on one, sailing off to\nforeign lands--but I WON'T let myself think of anything but Latin\nGrammar.\n\n\nThe prepositions a or ab, absque, coram, cum, de e or ex, prae, pro,\nsine, tenus, in, subter, sub and super govern the ablative.\n\n\nSo you see, Daddy, I am already plunged into work with my eyes\npersistently set against temptation.  Don't be cross with me, please,\nand don't think that I do not appreciate your kindness, for I\ndo--always--always.  The only way I can ever repay you is by turning\nout a Very Useful Citizen (Are women citizens?  I don't suppose they\nare.) Anyway, a Very Useful Person.  And when you look at me you can\nsay, 'I gave that Very Useful Person to the world.'\n\nThat sounds well, doesn't it, Daddy?  But I don't wish to mislead you.\nThe feeling often comes over me that I am not at all remarkable; it is\nfun to plan a career, but in all probability I shan't turn out a bit\ndifferent from any other ordinary person.  I may end by marrying an\nundertaker and being an inspiration to him in his work.\n\n                           Yours ever,\n                                           Judy\n\n\n\n\n                                                   19th August\n\nDear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\nMy window looks out on the loveliest landscape--ocean-scape,\nrather--nothing but water and rocks.\n\nThe summer goes.  I spend the morning with Latin and English and\nalgebra and my two stupid girls.  I don't know how Marion is ever going\nto get into college, or stay in after she gets there.  And as for\nFlorence, she is hopeless--but oh! such a little beauty.  I don't\nsuppose it matters in the least whether they are stupid or not so long\nas they are pretty?  One can't help thinking, though, how their\nconversation will bore their husbands, unless they are fortunate enough\nto obtain stupid husbands.  I suppose that's quite possible; the world\nseems to be filled with stupid men; I've met a number this summer.\n\nIn the afternoon we take a walk on the cliffs, or swim, if the tide is\nright.  I can swim in salt water with the utmost ease you see my\neducation is already being put to use!\n\nA letter comes from Mr. Jervis Pendleton in Paris, rather a short\nconcise letter; I'm not quite forgiven yet for refusing to follow his\nadvice.  However, if he gets back in time, he will see me for a few\ndays at Lock Willow before college opens, and if I am very nice and\nsweet and docile, I shall (I am led to infer) be received into favour\nagain.\n\nAlso a letter from Sallie.  She wants me to come to their camp for two\nweeks in September.  Must I ask your permission, or haven't I yet\narrived at the place where I can do as I please?  Yes, I am sure I\nhave--I'm a Senior, you know.  Having worked all summer, I feel like\ntaking a little healthful recreation; I want to see the Adirondacks; I\nwant to see Sallie; I want to see Sallie's brother--he's going to teach\nme to canoe--and (we come to my chief motive, which is mean) I want\nMaster Jervie to arrive at Lock Willow and find me not there.\n\nI MUST show him that he can't dictate to me.  No one can dictate to me\nbut you, Daddy--and you can't always!  I'm off for the woods.\n\n                                       Judy\n\n\n\n\n                                       CAMP MCBRIDE,\n                                                   6th September\n\nDear Daddy,\n\nYour letter didn't come in time (I am pleased to say). If you wish your\ninstructions to be obeyed, you must have your secretary transmit them\nin less than two weeks.  As you observe, I am here, and have been for\nfive days.\n\nThe woods are fine, and so is the camp, and so is the weather, and so\nare the McBrides, and so is the whole world.  I'm very happy!\n\nThere's Jimmie calling for me to come canoeing.  Goodbye--sorry to have\ndisobeyed, but why are you so persistent about not wanting me to play a\nlittle?  When I've worked all the summer I deserve two weeks.  You are\nawfully dog-in-the-mangerish.\n\nHowever--I love you still, Daddy, in spite of all your faults.\n\n                                           Judy\n\n\n\n\n                                                   3rd October\nDear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\nBack at college and a Senior--also editor of the Monthly.  It doesn't\nseem possible, does it, that so sophisticated a person, just four years\nago, was an inmate of the John Grier Home?  We do arrive fast in\nAmerica!\n\nWhat do you think of this?  A note from Master Jervie directed to Lock\nWillow and forwarded here.  He's sorry, but he finds that he can't get\nup there this autumn; he has accepted an invitation to go yachting with\nsome friends.  Hopes I've had a nice summer and am enjoying the country.\n\nAnd he knew all the time that I was with the McBrides, for Julia told\nhim so!  You men ought to leave intrigue to women; you haven't a light\nenough touch.\n\nJulia has a trunkful of the most ravishing new clothes--an evening gown\nof rainbow Liberty crepe that would be fitting raiment for the angels\nin Paradise.  And I thought that my own clothes this year were\nunprecedentedly (is there such a word?) beautiful.  I copied Mrs.\nPaterson's wardrobe with the aid of a cheap dressmaker, and though the\ngowns didn't turn out quite twins of the originals, I was entirely\nhappy until Julia unpacked.  But now--I live to see Paris!\n\nDear Daddy, aren't you glad you're not a girl?  I suppose you think\nthat the fuss we make over clothes is too absolutely silly?  It is.  No\ndoubt about it.  But it's entirely your fault.\n\nDid you ever hear about the learned Herr Professor who regarded\nunnecessary adornment with contempt and favoured sensible, utilitarian\nclothes for women?  His wife, who was an obliging creature, adopted\n'dress reform.'  And what do you think he did?  He eloped with a chorus\ngirl.\n\n                           Yours ever,\n                                                   Judy\n\n\nPS.  The chamber-maid in our corridor wears blue checked gingham\naprons.  I am going to get her some brown ones instead, and sink the\nblue ones in the bottom of the lake.  I have a reminiscent chill every\ntime I look at them.\n\n\n\n\n\n                                               17th November\n\nDear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\nSuch a blight has fallen over my literary career.  I don't know whether\nto tell you or not, but I would like some sympathy--silent sympathy,\nplease; don't re-open the wound by referring to it in your next letter.\n\nI've been writing a book, all last winter in the evenings, and all the\nsummer when I wasn't teaching Latin to my two stupid children.  I just\nfinished it before college opened and sent it to a publisher.  He kept\nit two months, and I was certain he was going to take it; but yesterday\nmorning an express parcel came (thirty cents due) and there it was back\nagain with a letter from the publisher, a very nice, fatherly\nletter--but frank!  He said he saw from the address that I was still at\ncollege, and if I would accept some advice, he would suggest that I put\nall of my energy into my lessons and wait until I graduated before\nbeginning to write.  He enclosed his reader's opinion.  Here it is:\n\n'Plot highly improbable.  Characterization exaggerated.  Conversation\nunnatural.  A good deal of humour but not always in the best of taste.\nTell her to keep on trying, and in time she may produce a real book.'\n\nNot on the whole flattering, is it, Daddy?  And I thought I was making\na notable addition to American literature.  I did truly.  I was\nplanning to surprise you by writing a great novel before I graduated.\nI collected the material for it while I was at Julia's last Christmas.\nBut I dare say the editor is right.  Probably two weeks was not enough\nin which to observe the manners and customs of a great city.\n\nI took it walking with me yesterday afternoon, and when I came to the\ngas house, I went in and asked the engineer if I might borrow his\nfurnace.  He politely opened the door, and with my own hands I chucked\nit in.  I felt as though I had cremated my only child!\n\nI went to bed last night utterly dejected; I thought I was never going\nto amount to anything, and that you had thrown away your money for\nnothing.  But what do you think?  I woke up this morning with a\nbeautiful new plot in my head, and I've been going about all day\nplanning my characters, just as happy as I could be.  No one can ever\naccuse me of being a pessimist!  If I had a husband and twelve children\nswallowed by an earthquake one day, I'd bob up smilingly the next\nmorning and commence to look for another set.\n\n                           Affectionately,\n                                               Judy\n\n\n\n\n                                               14th December\n\nDear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\nI dreamed the funniest dream last night.  I thought I went into a book\nstore and the clerk brought me a new book named The Life and Letters of\nJudy Abbott.  I could see it perfectly plainly--red cloth binding with\na picture of the John Grier Home on the cover, and my portrait for a\nfrontispiece with, 'Very truly yours, Judy Abbott,' written below.  But\njust as I was turning to the end to read the inscription on my\ntombstone, I woke up.  It was very annoying!  I almost found out whom\nI'm going to marry and when I'm going to die.\n\nDon't you think it would be interesting if you really could read the\nstory of your life--written perfectly truthfully by an omniscient\nauthor?  And suppose you could only read it on this condition:  that\nyou would never forget it, but would have to go through life knowing\nahead of time exactly how everything you did would turn out, and\nforeseeing to the exact hour the time when you would die.  How many\npeople do you suppose would have the courage to read it then? or how\nmany could suppress their curiosity sufficiently to escape from reading\nit, even at the price of having to live without hope and without\nsurprises?\n\nLife is monotonous enough at best; you have to eat and sleep about so\noften.  But imagine how DEADLY monotonous it would be if nothing\nunexpected could happen between meals.  Mercy!  Daddy, there's a blot,\nbut I'm on the third page and I can't begin a new sheet.\n\nI'm going on with biology again this year--very interesting subject;\nwe're studying the alimentary system at present.  You should see how\nsweet a cross-section of the duodenum of a cat is under the microscope.\n\nAlso we've arrived at philosophy--interesting but evanescent.  I prefer\nbiology where you can pin the subject under discussion to a board.\nThere's another!  And another!  This pen is weeping copiously.  Please\nexcuse its tears.\n\nDo you believe in free will?  I do--unreservedly.  I don't agree at all\nwith the philosophers who think that every action is the absolutely\ninevitable and automatic resultant of an aggregation of remote causes.\nThat's the most immoral doctrine I ever heard--nobody would be to blame\nfor anything.  If a man believed in fatalism, he would naturally just\nsit down and say, 'The Lord's will be done,' and continue to sit until\nhe fell over dead.\n\nI believe absolutely in my own free will and my own power to\naccomplish--and that is the belief that moves mountains.  You watch me\nbecome a great author!  I have four chapters of my new book finished\nand five more drafted.\n\nThis is a very abstruse letter--does your head ache, Daddy?  I think\nwe'll stop now and make some fudge.  I'm sorry I can't send you a\npiece; it will be unusually good, for we're going to make it with real\ncream and three butter balls.\n\n                       Yours affectionately,\n                                               Judy\n\n\nPS.  We're having fancy dancing in gymnasium class.  You can see by the\naccompanying picture how much we look like a real ballet.  The one at\nthe end accomplishing a graceful pirouette is me--I mean I.\n\n\n\n\n                                               26th December\n\nMy Dear, Dear, Daddy,\n\nHaven't you any sense?  Don't you KNOW that you mustn't give one girl\nseventeen Christmas presents?  I'm a Socialist, please remember; do you\nwish to turn me into a Plutocrat?\n\nThink how embarrassing it would be if we should ever quarrel!  I should\nhave to engage a moving-van to return your gifts.\n\nI am sorry that the necktie I sent was so wobbly; I knit it with my own\nhands (as you doubtless discovered from internal evidence).  You will\nhave to wear it on cold days and keep your coat buttoned up tight.\n\nThank you, Daddy, a thousand times.  I think you're the sweetest man\nthat ever lived--and the foolishest!\n\n                                                   Judy\n\n\nHere's a four-leaf clover from Camp McBride to bring you good luck for\nthe New Year.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   9th January\n\nDo you wish to do something, Daddy, that will ensure your eternal\nsalvation?  There is a family here who are in awfully desperate\nstraits.  A mother and father and four visible children--the two older\nboys have disappeared into the world to make their fortune and have not\nsent any of it back.  The father worked in a glass factory and got\nconsumption--it's awfully unhealthy work--and now has been sent away to\na hospital.  That took all their savings, and the support of the family\nfalls upon the oldest daughter, who is twenty-four. She dressmakes for\n$1.50 a day (when she can get it) and embroiders centrepieces in the\nevening.  The mother isn't very strong and is extremely ineffectual and\npious.  She sits with her hands folded, a picture of patient\nresignation, while the daughter kills herself with overwork and\nresponsibility and worry; she doesn't see how they are going to get\nthrough the rest of the winter--and I don't either.  One hundred\ndollars would buy some coal and some shoes for three children so that\nthey could go to school, and give a little margin so that she needn't\nworry herself to death when a few days pass and she doesn't get work.\n\nYou are the richest man I know.  Don't you suppose you could spare one\nhundred dollars?  That girl deserves help a lot more than I ever did.\nI wouldn't ask it except for the girl; I don't care much what happens\nto the mother--she is such a jelly-fish.\n\nThe way people are for ever rolling their eyes to heaven and saying,\n'Perhaps it's all for the best,' when they are perfectly dead sure it's\nnot, makes me enraged.  Humility or resignation or whatever you choose\nto call it, is simply impotent inertia.  I'm for a more militant\nreligion!\n\nWe are getting the most dreadful lessons in philosophy--all of\nSchopenhauer for tomorrow.  The professor doesn't seem to realize that\nwe are taking any other subject.  He's a queer old duck; he goes about\nwith his head in the clouds and blinks dazedly when occasionally he\nstrikes solid earth.  He tries to lighten his lectures with an\noccasional witticism--and we do our best to smile, but I assure you his\njokes are no laughing matter.  He spends his entire time between\nclasses in trying to figure out whether matter really exists or whether\nhe only thinks it exists.\n\nI'm sure my sewing girl hasn't any doubt but that it exists!\n\nWhere do you think my new novel is?  In the waste-basket. I can see\nmyself that it's no good on earth, and when a loving author realizes\nthat, what WOULD be the judgment of a critical public?\n\n\n                                                       Later\n\nI address you, Daddy, from a bed of pain.  For two days I've been laid\nup with swollen tonsils; I can just swallow hot milk, and that is all.\n'What were your parents thinking of not to have those tonsils out when\nyou were a baby?' the doctor wished to know.  I'm sure I haven't an\nidea, but I doubt if they were thinking much about me.\n\n                                   Yours,\n                                               J. A.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   Next morning\n\nI just read this over before sealing it.  I don't know WHY I cast such\na misty atmosphere over life.  I hasten to assure you that I am young\nand happy and exuberant; and I trust you are the same.  Youth has\nnothing to do with birthdays, only with ALIVEDNESS of spirit, so even\nif your hair is grey, Daddy, you can still be a boy.\n\n                           Affectionately,\n                                                   Judy\n\n\n\n\n                                                   12th Jan.\n\nDear Mr. Philanthropist,\n\nYour cheque for my family came yesterday.  Thank you so much!  I cut\ngymnasium and took it down to them right after luncheon, and you should\nhave seen the girl's face!  She was so surprised and happy and relieved\nthat she looked almost young; and she's only twenty-four. Isn't it\npitiful?\n\nAnyway, she feels now as though all the good things were coming\ntogether.  She has steady work ahead for two months--someone's getting\nmarried, and there's a trousseau to make.\n\n'Thank the good Lord!' cried the mother, when she grasped the fact that\nthat small piece of paper was one hundred dollars.\n\n'It wasn't the good Lord at all,' said I, 'it was Daddy-Long-Legs.'\n(Mr. Smith, I called you.)\n\n'But it was the good Lord who put it in his mind,' said she.\n\n'Not at all!  I put it in his mind myself,' said I.\n\nBut anyway, Daddy, I trust the good Lord will reward you suitably.  You\ndeserve ten thousand years out of purgatory.\n\n                   Yours most gratefully,\n                                           Judy Abbott\n\n\n\n\n                                                   15th Feb.\n\nMay it please Your Most Excellent Majesty:\n\nThis morning I did eat my breakfast upon a cold turkey pie and a goose,\nand I did send for a cup of tee (a china drink) of which I had never\ndrank before.\n\nDon't be nervous, Daddy--I haven't lost my mind; I'm merely quoting\nSam'l Pepys.  We're reading him in connection with English History,\noriginal sources.  Sallie and Julia and I converse now in the language\nof 1660.  Listen to this:\n\n'I went to Charing Cross to see Major Harrison hanged, drawn and\nquartered:  he looking as cheerful as any man could do in that\ncondition.'  And this:  'Dined with my lady who is in handsome mourning\nfor her brother who died yesterday of spotted fever.'\n\nSeems a little early to commence entertaining, doesn't it?  A friend of\nPepys devised a very cunning manner whereby the king might pay his\ndebts out of the sale to poor people of old decayed provisions.  What\ndo you, a reformer, think of that?  I don't believe we're so bad today\nas the newspapers make out.\n\nSamuel was as excited about his clothes as any girl; he spent five\ntimes as much on dress as his wife--that appears to have been the\nGolden Age of husbands.  Isn't this a touching entry?  You see he\nreally was honest.  'Today came home my fine Camlett cloak with gold\nbuttons, which cost me much money, and I pray God to make me able to\npay for it.'\n\nExcuse me for being so full of Pepys; I'm writing a special topic on\nhim.\n\nWhat do you think, Daddy?  The Self-Government Association has\nabolished the ten o'clock rule.  We can keep our lights all night if we\nchoose, the only requirement being that we do not disturb others--we\nare not supposed to entertain on a large scale.  The result is a\nbeautiful commentary on human nature.  Now that we may stay up as long\nas we choose, we no longer choose.  Our heads begin to nod at nine\no'clock, and by nine-thirty the pen drops from our nerveless grasp.\nIt's nine-thirty now.  Good night.\n\n\n                                                   Sunday\n\nJust back from church--preacher from Georgia.  We must take care, he\nsays, not to develop our intellects at the expense of our emotional\nnatures--but methought it was a poor, dry sermon (Pepys again). It\ndoesn't matter what part of the United States or Canada they come from,\nor what denomination they are, we always get the same sermon.  Why on\nearth don't they go to men's colleges and urge the students not to\nallow their manly natures to be crushed out by too much mental\napplication?\n\nIt's a beautiful day--frozen and icy and clear.  As soon as dinner is\nover, Sallie and Julia and Marty Keene and Eleanor Pratt (friends of\nmine, but you don't know them) and I are going to put on short skirts\nand walk 'cross country to Crystal Spring Farm and have a fried chicken\nand waffle supper, and then have Mr. Crystal Spring drive us home in\nhis buckboard.  We are supposed to be inside the campus at seven, but\nwe are going to stretch a point tonight and make it eight.\n\nFarewell, kind Sir.\n\n       I have the honour of subscribing myself,\n           Your most loyall, dutifull, faithfull and obedient servant,\n                                           J. Abbott\n\n\n\n\n                                                   March Fifth\n\nDear Mr. Trustee,\n\nTomorrow is the first Wednesday in the month--a weary day for the John\nGrier Home.  How relieved they'll be when five o'clock comes and you\npat them on the head and take yourselves off!  Did you (individually)\never pat me on the head, Daddy?  I don't believe so--my memory seems to\nbe concerned only with fat Trustees.\n\nGive the Home my love, please--my TRULY love.  I have quite a feeling\nof tenderness for it as I look back through a haze of four years.  When\nI first came to college I felt quite resentful because I'd been robbed\nof the normal kind of childhood that the other girls had had; but now,\nI don't feel that way in the least.  I regard it as a very unusual\nadventure.  It gives me a sort of vantage point from which to stand\naside and look at life.  Emerging full grown, I get a perspective on\nthe world, that other people who have been brought up in the thick of\nthings entirely lack.\n\nI know lots of girls (Julia, for instance) who never know that they are\nhappy.  They are so accustomed to the feeling that their senses are\ndeadened to it; but as for me--I am perfectly sure every moment of my\nlife that I am happy.  And I'm going to keep on being, no matter what\nunpleasant things turn up.  I'm going to regard them (even toothaches)\nas interesting experiences, and be glad to know what they feel like.\n'Whatever sky's above me, I've a heart for any fate.'\n\nHowever, Daddy, don't take this new affection for the J.G.H.  too\nliterally.  If I have five children, like Rousseau, I shan't leave them\non the steps of a foundling asylum in order to insure their being\nbrought up simply.\n\nGive my kindest regards to Mrs. Lippett (that, I think, is truthful;\nlove would be a little strong) and don't forget to tell her what a\nbeautiful nature I've developed.\n\n                               Affectionately,\n                                                   Judy\n\n\n\n                                              LOCK WILLOW,\n                                                  4th April\n\nDear Daddy,\n\nDo you observe the postmark?  Sallie and I are embellishing Lock Willow\nwith our presence during the Easter Vacation.  We decided that the best\nthing we could do with our ten days was to come where it is quiet.  Our\nnerves had got to the point where they wouldn't stand another meal in\nFergussen.  Dining in a room with four hundred girls is an ordeal when\nyou are tired.  There is so much noise that you can't hear the girls\nacross the table speak unless they make their hands into a megaphone\nand shout.  That is the truth.\n\nWe are tramping over the hills and reading and writing, and having a\nnice, restful time.  We climbed to the top of 'Sky Hill' this morning\nwhere Master Jervie and I once cooked supper--it doesn't seem possible\nthat it was nearly two years ago.  I could still see the place where\nthe smoke of our fire blackened the rock.  It is funny how certain\nplaces get connected with certain people, and you never go back without\nthinking of them.  I was quite lonely without him--for two minutes.\n\nWhat do you think is my latest activity, Daddy?  You will begin to\nbelieve that I am incorrigible--I am writing a book.  I started it\nthree weeks ago and am eating it up in chunks.  I've caught the secret.\nMaster Jervie and that editor man were right; you are most convincing\nwhen you write about the things you know.  And this time it is about\nsomething that I do know--exhaustively.  Guess where it's laid?  In the\nJohn Grier Home!  And it's good, Daddy, I actually believe it is--just\nabout the tiny little things that happened every day.  I'm a realist\nnow.  I've abandoned romanticism; I shall go back to it later though,\nwhen my own adventurous future begins.\n\nThis new book is going to get itself finished--and published!  You see\nif it doesn't. If you just want a thing hard enough and keep on trying,\nyou do get it in the end.  I've been trying for four years to get a\nletter from you--and I haven't given up hope yet.\n\nGoodbye, Daddy dear,\n\n(I like to call you Daddy dear; it's so alliterative.)\n\n                                   Affectionately,\n                                                   Judy\n\n\nPS.  I forgot to tell you the farm news, but it's very distressing.\nSkip this postscript if you don't want your sensibilities all wrought\nup.\n\nPoor old Grove is dead.  He got so that he couldn't chew and they had\nto shoot him.\n\nNine chickens were killed by a weasel or a skunk or a rat last week.\n\nOne of the cows is sick, and we had to have the veterinary surgeon out\nfrom Bonnyrigg Four Corners.  Amasai stayed up all night to give her\nlinseed oil and whisky.  But we have an awful suspicion that the poor\nsick cow got nothing but linseed oil.\n\nSentimental Tommy (the tortoise-shell cat) has disappeared; we are\nafraid he has been caught in a trap.\n\nThere are lots of troubles in the world!\n\n\n\n\n                                                   17th May\n\nDear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\nThis is going to be extremely short because my shoulder aches at the\nsight of a pen.  Lecture notes all day, immortal novel all evening,\nmake too much writing.\n\nCommencement three weeks from next Wednesday.  I think you might come\nand make my acquaintance--I shall hate you if you don't! Julia's\ninviting Master Jervie, he being her family, and Sallie's inviting\nJimmie McB., he being her family, but who is there for me to invite?\nJust you and Lippett, and I don't want her.  Please come.\n\nYours, with love and writer's cramp.\n                                               Judy\n\n\n\n\n                                                  LOCK WILLOW,\n                                                     19th June\n\nDear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\nI'm educated!  My diploma is in the bottom bureau drawer with my two\nbest dresses.  Commencement was as usual, with a few showers at vital\nmoments.  Thank you for your rosebuds.  They were lovely.  Master\nJervie and Master Jimmie both gave me roses, too, but I left theirs in\nthe bath tub and carried yours in the class procession.\n\nHere I am at Lock Willow for the summer--for ever maybe.  The board is\ncheap; the surroundings quiet and conducive to a literary life.  What\nmore does a struggling author wish?  I am mad about my book.  I think\nof it every waking moment, and dream of it at night.  All I want is\npeace and quiet and lots of time to work (interspersed with nourishing\nmeals).\n\nMaster Jervie is coming up for a week or so in August, and Jimmie\nMcBride is going to drop in sometime through the summer.  He's\nconnected with a bond house now, and goes about the country selling\nbonds to banks.  He's going to combine the 'Farmers' National' at the\nCorners and me on the same trip.\n\nYou see that Lock Willow isn't entirely lacking in society.  I'd be\nexpecting to have you come motoring through--only I know now that that\nis hopeless.  When you wouldn't come to my commencement, I tore you\nfrom my heart and buried you for ever.\n\n                           Judy Abbott, A.B.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   24th July\n\nDearest Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\nIsn't it fun to work--or don't you ever do it?  It's especially fun\nwhen your kind of work is the thing you'd rather do more than anything\nelse in the world.  I've been writing as fast as my pen would go every\nday this summer, and my only quarrel with life is that the days aren't\nlong enough to write all the beautiful and valuable and entertaining\nthoughts I'm thinking.\n\nI've finished the second draft of my book and am going to begin the\nthird tomorrow morning at half-past seven.  It's the sweetest book you\never saw--it is, truly.  I think of nothing else.  I can barely wait in\nthe morning to dress and eat before beginning; then I write and write\nand write till suddenly I'm so tired that I'm limp all over.  Then I go\nout with Colin (the new sheep dog) and romp through the fields and get\na fresh supply of ideas for the next day.  It's the most beautiful book\nyou ever saw--Oh, pardon--I said that before.\n\nYou don't think me conceited, do you, Daddy dear?\n\nI'm not, really, only just now I'm in the enthusiastic stage.  Maybe\nlater on I'll get cold and critical and sniffy.  No, I'm sure I won't!\nThis time I've written a real book.  Just wait till you see it.\n\nI'll try for a minute to talk about something else.  I never told you,\ndid I, that Amasai and Carrie got married last May?  They are still\nworking here, but so far as I can see it has spoiled them both.  She\nused to laugh when he tramped in mud or dropped ashes on the floor, but\nnow--you should hear her scold!  And she doesn't curl her hair any\nlonger.  Amasai, who used to be so obliging about beating rugs and\ncarrying wood, grumbles if you suggest such a thing.  Also his neckties\nare quite dingy--black and brown, where they used to be scarlet and\npurple.  I've determined never to marry.  It's a deteriorating process,\nevidently.\n\nThere isn't much of any farm news.  The animals are all in the best of\nhealth.  The pigs are unusually fat, the cows seem contented and the\nhens are laying well.  Are you interested in poultry?  If so, let me\nrecommend that invaluable little work, 200 Eggs per Hen per Year.  I am\nthinking of starting an incubator next spring and raising broilers.\nYou see I'm settled at Lock Willow permanently.  I have decided to stay\nuntil I've written 114 novels like Anthony Trollope's mother.  Then I\nshall have completed my life work and can retire and travel.\n\nMr. James McBride spent last Sunday with us.  Fried chicken and\nice-cream for dinner, both of which he appeared to appreciate.  I was\nawfully glad to see him; he brought a momentary reminder that the world\nat large exists.  Poor Jimmie is having a hard time peddling his bonds.\nThe 'Farmers' National' at the Corners wouldn't have anything to do\nwith them in spite of the fact that they pay six per cent.  interest\nand sometimes seven.  I think he'll end up by going home to Worcester\nand taking a job in his father's factory.  He's too open and confiding\nand kind-hearted ever to make a successful financier.  But to be the\nmanager of a flourishing overall factory is a very desirable position,\ndon't you think?  Just now he turns up his nose at overalls, but he'll\ncome to them.\n\nI hope you appreciate the fact that this is a long letter from a person\nwith writer's cramp.  But I still love you, Daddy dear, and I'm very\nhappy.  With beautiful scenery all about, and lots to eat and a\ncomfortable four-post bed and a ream of blank paper and a pint of\nink--what more does one want in the world?\n\n                           Yours as always,\n                                               Judy\n\nPS.  The postman arrives with some more news.  We are to expect Master\nJervie on Friday next to spend a week.  That's a very pleasant\nprospect--only I am afraid my poor book will suffer.  Master Jervie is\nvery demanding.\n\n\n\n\n                                               27th August\n\nDear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\nWhere are you, I wonder?\n\nI never know what part of the world you are in, but I hope you're not\nin New York during this awful weather.  I hope you're on a mountain\npeak (but not in Switzerland; somewhere nearer) looking at the snow and\nthinking about me.  Please be thinking about me.  I'm quite lonely and\nI want to be thought about.  Oh, Daddy, I wish I knew you!  Then when\nwe were unhappy we could cheer each other up.\n\nI don't think I can stand much more of Lock Willow.  I'm thinking of\nmoving.  Sallie is going to do settlement work in Boston next winter.\nDon't you think it would be nice for me to go with her, then we could\nhave a studio together?  I would write while she SETTLED and we could\nbe together in the evenings.  Evenings are very long when there's no\none but the Semples and Carrie and Amasai to talk to.  I know in\nadvance that you won't like my studio idea.  I can read your\nsecretary's letter now:\n\n\n'Miss Jerusha Abbott.\n       'DEAR MADAM,\n\n'Mr. Smith prefers that you remain at Lock Willow.\n               'Yours truly,\n                           'ELMER H. GRIGGS.'\n\n\nI hate your secretary.  I am certain that a man named Elmer H. Griggs\nmust be horrid.  But truly, Daddy, I think I shall have to go to\nBoston.  I can't stay here.  If something doesn't happen soon, I shall\nthrow myself into the silo pit out of sheer desperation.\n\nMercy! but it's hot.  All the grass is burnt up and the brooks are dry\nand the roads are dusty.  It hasn't rained for weeks and weeks.\n\nThis letter sounds as though I had hydrophobia, but I haven't. I just\nwant some family.\n\nGoodbye, my dearest Daddy.\n\n                           I wish I knew you.\n                                               Judy\n\n\n\n\n                                         LOCK WILLOW,\n                                           19th September\n\nDear Daddy,\n\nSomething has happened and I need advice.  I need it from you, and from\nnobody else in the world.  Wouldn't it be possible for me to see you?\nIt's so much easier to talk than to write; and I'm afraid your\nsecretary might open the letter.\n                                           Judy\n\nPS.  I'm very unhappy.\n\n\n\n\n                                   LOCK WILLOW,\n                                               3rd October\n\nDear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\nYour note written in your own hand--and a pretty wobbly hand!--came\nthis morning.  I am so sorry that you have been ill; I wouldn't have\nbothered you with my affairs if I had known.  Yes, I will tell you the\ntrouble, but it's sort of complicated to write, and VERY PRIVATE.\nPlease don't keep this letter, but burn it.\n\nBefore I begin--here's a cheque for one thousand dollars.  It seems\nfunny, doesn't it, for me to be sending a cheque to you?  Where do you\nthink I got it?\n\nI've sold my story, Daddy.  It's going to be published serially in\nseven parts, and then in a book!  You might think I'd be wild with joy,\nbut I'm not.  I'm entirely apathetic.  Of course I'm glad to begin\npaying you--I owe you over two thousand more.  It's coming in\ninstalments.  Now don't be horrid, please, about taking it, because it\nmakes me happy to return it.  I owe you a great deal more than the mere\nmoney, and the rest I will continue to pay all my life in gratitude and\naffection.\n\nAnd now, Daddy, about the other thing; please give me your most worldly\nadvice, whether you think I'll like it or not.\n\nYou know that I've always had a very special feeling towards you; you\nsort of represented my whole family; but you won't mind, will you, if I\ntell you that I have a very much more special feeling for another man?\nYou can probably guess without much trouble who he is.  I suspect that\nmy letters have been very full of Master Jervie for a very long time.\n\nI wish I could make you understand what he is like and how entirely\ncompanionable we are.  We think the same about everything--I am afraid\nI have a tendency to make over my ideas to match his!  But he is almost\nalways right; he ought to be, you know, for he has fourteen years'\nstart of me.  In other ways, though, he's just an overgrown boy, and he\ndoes need looking after--he hasn't any sense about wearing rubbers when\nit rains.  He and I always think the same things are funny, and that is\nsuch a lot; it's dreadful when two people's senses of humour are\nantagonistic.  I don't believe there's any bridging that gulf!\n\nAnd he is--Oh, well!  He is just himself, and I miss him, and miss him,\nand miss him.  The whole world seems empty and aching.  I hate the\nmoonlight because it's beautiful and he isn't here to see it with me.\nBut maybe you've loved somebody, too, and you know?  If you have, I\ndon't need to explain; if you haven't, I can't explain.\n\nAnyway, that's the way I feel--and I've refused to marry him.\n\nI didn't tell him why; I was just dumb and miserable.  I couldn't think\nof anything to say.  And now he has gone away imagining that I want to\nmarry Jimmie McBride--I don't in the least, I wouldn't think of\nmarrying Jimmie; he isn't grown up enough.  But Master Jervie and I got\ninto a dreadful muddle of misunderstanding and we both hurt each\nother's feelings.  The reason I sent him away was not because I didn't\ncare for him, but because I cared for him so much.  I was afraid he\nwould regret it in the future--and I couldn't stand that!  It didn't\nseem right for a person of my lack of antecedents to marry into any\nsuch family as his.  I never told him about the orphan asylum, and I\nhated to explain that I didn't know who I was.  I may be DREADFUL, you\nknow.  And his family are proud--and I'm proud, too!\n\nAlso, I felt sort of bound to you.  After having been educated to be a\nwriter, I must at least try to be one; it would scarcely be fair to\naccept your education and then go off and not use it.  But now that I\nam going to be able to pay back the money, I feel that I have partially\ndischarged that debt--besides, I suppose I could keep on being a writer\neven if I did marry.  The two professions are not necessarily exclusive.\n\nI've been thinking very hard about it.  Of course he is a Socialist,\nand he has unconventional ideas; maybe he wouldn't mind marrying into\nthe proletariat so much as some men might.  Perhaps when two people are\nexactly in accord, and always happy when together and lonely when\napart, they ought not to let anything in the world stand between them.\nOf course I WANT to believe that!  But I'd like to get your unemotional\nopinion.  You probably belong to a Family also, and will look at it\nfrom a worldly point of view and not just a sympathetic, human point of\nview--so you see how brave I am to lay it before you.\n\nSuppose I go to him and explain that the trouble isn't Jimmie, but is\nthe John Grier Home--would that be a dreadful thing for me to do?  It\nwould take a great deal of courage.  I'd almost rather be miserable for\nthe rest of my life.\n\nThis happened nearly two months ago; I haven't heard a word from him\nsince he was here.  I was just getting sort of acclimated to the\nfeeling of a broken heart, when a letter came from Julia that stirred\nme all up again.  She said--very casually--that 'Uncle Jervis' had been\ncaught out all night in a storm when he was hunting in Canada, and had\nbeen ill ever since with pneumonia.  And I never knew it.  I was\nfeeling hurt because he had just disappeared into blankness without a\nword.  I think he's pretty unhappy, and I know I am!\n\nWhat seems to you the right thing for me to do?\n\n                                               Judy\n\n\n\n\n                                               6th October\n\nDearest Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\nYes, certainly I'll come--at half-past four next Wednesday afternoon.\nOf COURSE I can find the way.  I've been in New York three times and am\nnot quite a baby.  I can't believe that I am really going to see\nyou--I've been just THINKING you so long that it hardly seems as though\nyou are a tangible flesh-and-blood person.\n\nYou are awfully good, Daddy, to bother yourself with me, when you're\nnot strong.  Take care and don't catch cold.  These fall rains are very\ndamp.\n\n                               Affectionately,\n                                                   Judy\n\n\nPS.  I've just had an awful thought.  Have you a butler?  I'm afraid of\nbutlers, and if one opens the door I shall faint upon the step.  What\ncan I say to him?  You didn't tell me your name.  Shall I ask for Mr.\nSmith?\n\n\n\n\n                                       Thursday Morning\n\nMy Very Dearest Master-Jervie-Daddy-Long-Legs Pendleton-Smith,\n\nDid you sleep last night?  I didn't. Not a single wink.  I was too\namazed and excited and bewildered and happy.  I don't believe I ever\nshall sleep again--or eat either.  But I hope you slept; you must, you\nknow, because then you will get well faster and can come to me.\n\nDear Man, I can't bear to think how ill you've been--and all the time I\nnever knew it.  When the doctor came down yesterday to put me in the\ncab, he told me that for three days they gave you up.  Oh, dearest, if\nthat had happened, the light would have gone out of the world for me.\nI suppose that some day in the far future--one of us must leave the\nother; but at least we shall have had our happiness and there will be\nmemories to live with.\n\nI meant to cheer you up--and instead I have to cheer myself.  For in\nspite of being happier than I ever dreamed I could be, I'm also\nsoberer.  The fear that something may happen rests like a shadow on my\nheart.  Always before I could be frivolous and care-free and\nunconcerned, because I had nothing precious to lose.  But now--I shall\nhave a Great Big Worry all the rest of my life.  Whenever you are away\nfrom me I shall be thinking of all the automobiles that can run over\nyou, or the sign-boards that can fall on your head, or the dreadful,\nsquirmy germs that you may be swallowing.  My peace of mind is gone for\never--but anyway, I never cared much for just plain peace.\n\nPlease get well--fast--fast--fast.  I want to have you close by where I\ncan touch you and make sure you are tangible.  Such a little half hour\nwe had together!  I'm afraid maybe I dreamed it.  If I were only a\nmember of your family (a very distant fourth cousin) then I could come\nand visit you every day, and read aloud and plump up your pillow and\nsmooth out those two little wrinkles in your forehead and make the\ncorners of your mouth turn up in a nice cheerful smile.  But you are\ncheerful again, aren't you?  You were yesterday before I left.  The\ndoctor said I must be a good nurse, that you looked ten years younger.\nI hope that being in love doesn't make every one ten years younger.\nWill you still care for me, darling, if I turn out to be only eleven?\n\nYesterday was the most wonderful day that could ever happen.  If I live\nto be ninety-nine I shall never forget the tiniest detail.  The girl\nthat left Lock Willow at dawn was a very different person from the one\nwho came back at night.  Mrs. Semple called me at half-past four.  I\nstarted wide awake in the darkness and the first thought that popped\ninto my head was, 'I am going to see Daddy-Long-Legs!' I ate breakfast\nin the kitchen by candle-light, and then drove the five miles to the\nstation through the most glorious October colouring.  The sun came up\non the way, and the swamp maples and dogwood glowed crimson and orange\nand the stone walls and cornfields sparkled with hoar frost; the air\nwas keen and clear and full of promise.  I knew something was going to\nhappen.  All the way in the train the rails kept singing, 'You're going\nto see Daddy-Long-Legs.' It made me feel secure.  I had such faith in\nDaddy's ability to set things right.  And I knew that somewhere another\nman--dearer than Daddy--was wanting to see me, and somehow I had a\nfeeling that before the journey ended I should meet him, too.  And you\nsee!\n\nWhen I came to the house on Madison Avenue it looked so big and brown\nand forbidding that I didn't dare go in, so I walked around the block\nto get up my courage.  But I needn't have been a bit afraid; your\nbutler is such a nice, fatherly old man that he made me feel at home at\nonce.  'Is this Miss Abbott?' he said to me, and I said, 'Yes,' so I\ndidn't have to ask for Mr. Smith after all.  He told me to wait in the\ndrawing-room. It was a very sombre, magnificent, man's sort of room.  I\nsat down on the edge of a big upholstered chair and kept saying to\nmyself:\n\n'I'm going to see Daddy-Long-Legs! I'm going to see Daddy-Long-Legs!'\n\n\nThen presently the man came back and asked me please to step up to the\nlibrary.  I was so excited that really and truly my feet would hardly\ntake me up.  Outside the door he turned and whispered, 'He's been very\nill, Miss. This is the first day he's been allowed to sit up.  You'll\nnot stay long enough to excite him?' I knew from the way he said it\nthat he loved you--and I think he's an old dear!\n\nThen he knocked and said, 'Miss Abbott,' and I went in and the door\nclosed behind me.\n\nIt was so dim coming in from the brightly lighted hall that for a\nmoment I could scarcely make out anything; then I saw a big easy chair\nbefore the fire and a shining tea table with a smaller chair beside it.\nAnd I realized that a man was sitting in the big chair propped up by\npillows with a rug over his knees.  Before I could stop him he\nrose--rather shakily--and steadied himself by the back of the chair and\njust looked at me without a word.  And then--and then--I saw it was\nyou!  But even with that I didn't understand.  I thought Daddy had had\nyou come there to meet me or a surprise.\n\nThen you laughed and held out your hand and said, 'Dear little Judy,\ncouldn't you guess that I was Daddy-Long-Legs?'\n\nIn an instant it flashed over me.  Oh, but I have been stupid!  A\nhundred little things might have told me, if I had had any wits.  I\nwouldn't make a very good detective, would I, Daddy?  Jervie?  What\nmust I call you?  Just plain Jervie sounds disrespectful, and I can't\nbe disrespectful to you!\n\nIt was a very sweet half hour before your doctor came and sent me away.\nI was so dazed when I got to the station that I almost took a train for\nSt Louis.  And you were pretty dazed, too.  You forgot to give me any\ntea.  But we're both very, very happy, aren't we?  I drove back to Lock\nWillow in the dark but oh, how the stars were shining!  And this\nmorning I've been out with Colin visiting all the places that you and I\nwent to together, and remembering what you said and how you looked.\nThe woods today are burnished bronze and the air is full of frost.\nIt's CLIMBING weather.  I wish you were here to climb the hills with\nme.  I am missing you dreadfully, Jervie dear, but it's a happy kind of\nmissing; we'll be together soon.  We belong to each other now really\nand truly, no make-believe. Doesn't it seem queer for me to belong to\nsomeone at last?  It seems very, very sweet.\n\nAnd I shall never let you be sorry for a single instant.\n\n                       Yours, for ever and ever,\n                                                   Judy\n\n\nPS.  This is the first love-letter I ever wrote.  Isn't it funny that I\nknow how?",
