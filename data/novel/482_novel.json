 "text": "THE WOODLANDERS\n\n\nby\n\nThomas Hardy\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nThe rambler who, for old association or other reasons, should trace the\nforsaken coach-road running almost in a meridional line from Bristol to\nthe south shore of England, would find himself during the latter half\nof his journey in the vicinity of some extensive woodlands,\ninterspersed with apple-orchards.  Here the trees, timber or\nfruit-bearing, as the case may be, make the wayside hedges ragged by\ntheir drip and shade, stretching over the road with easeful\nhorizontality, as if they found the unsubstantial air an adequate\nsupport for their limbs.  At one place, where a hill is crossed, the\nlargest of the woods shows itself bisected by the high-way, as the head\nof thick hair is bisected by the white line of its parting.  The spot\nis lonely.\n\nThe physiognomy of a deserted highway expresses solitude to a degree\nthat is not reached by mere dales or downs, and bespeaks a tomb-like\nstillness more emphatic than that of glades and pools. The contrast of\nwhat is with what might be probably accounts for this.  To step, for\ninstance, at the place under notice, from the hedge of the plantation\ninto the adjoining pale thoroughfare, and pause amid its emptiness for\na moment, was to exchange by the act of a single stride the simple\nabsence of human companionship for an incubus of the forlorn.\n\nAt this spot, on the lowering evening of a by-gone winter's day, there\nstood a man who had entered upon the scene much in the aforesaid\nmanner.  Alighting into the road from a stile hard by, he, though by no\nmeans a \"chosen vessel\" for impressions, was temporarily influenced by\nsome such feeling of being suddenly more alone than before he had\nemerged upon the highway.\n\nIt could be seen by a glance at his rather finical style of dress that\nhe did not belong to the country proper; and from his air, after a\nwhile, that though there might be a sombre beauty in the scenery, music\nin the breeze, and a wan procession of coaching ghosts in the sentiment\nof this old turnpike-road, he was mainly puzzled about the way.  The\ndead men's work that had been expended in climbing that hill, the\nblistered soles that had trodden it, and the tears that had wetted it,\nwere not his concern; for fate had given him no time for any but\npractical things.\n\nHe looked north and south, and mechanically prodded the ground with his\nwalking-stick.  A closer glance at his face corroborated the testimony\nof his clothes.  It was self-complacent, yet there was small apparent\nground for such complacence.  Nothing irradiated it; to the eye of the\nmagician in character, if not to the ordinary observer, the expression\nenthroned there was absolute submission to and belief in a little\nassortment of forms and habitudes.\n\nAt first not a soul appeared who could enlighten him as he desired, or\nseemed likely to appear that night.  But presently a slight noise of\nlaboring wheels and the steady dig of a horse's shoe-tips became\naudible; and there loomed in the notch of the hill and plantation that\nthe road formed here at the summit a carrier's van drawn by a single\nhorse.  When it got nearer, he said, with some relief to himself, \"'Tis\nMrs. Dollery's--this will help me.\"\n\nThe vehicle was half full of passengers, mostly women.  He held up his\nstick at its approach, and the woman who was driving drew rein.\n\n\"I've been trying to find a short way to Little Hintock this last\nhalf-hour, Mrs. Dollery,\" he said.  \"But though I've been to Great\nHintock and Hintock House half a dozen times I am at fault about the\nsmall village.  You can help me, I dare say?\"\n\nShe assured him that she could--that as she went to Great Hintock her\nvan passed near it--that it was only up the lane that branched out of\nthe lane into which she was about to turn--just ahead. \"Though,\"\ncontinued Mrs. Dollery, \"'tis such a little small place that, as a town\ngentleman, you'd need have a candle and lantern to find it if ye don't\nknow where 'tis.  Bedad! I wouldn't live there if they'd pay me to.\nNow at Great Hintock you do see the world a bit.\"\n\nHe mounted and sat beside her, with his feet outside, where they were\never and anon brushed over by the horse's tail.\n\nThis van, driven and owned by Mrs. Dollery, was rather a movable\nattachment of the roadway than an extraneous object, to those who knew\nit well.  The old horse, whose hair was of the roughness and color of\nheather, whose leg-joints, shoulders, and hoofs were distorted by\nharness and drudgery from colthood--though if all had their rights, he\nought, symmetrical in outline, to have been picking the herbage of some\nEastern plain instead of tugging here--had trodden this road almost\ndaily for twenty years.  Even his subjection was not made congruous\nthroughout, for the harness being too short, his tail was not drawn\nthrough the crupper, so that the breeching slipped awkwardly to one\nside.  He knew every subtle incline of the seven or eight miles of\nground between Hintock and Sherton Abbas--the market-town to which he\njourneyed--as accurately as any surveyor could have learned it by a\nDumpy level.\n\nThe vehicle had a square black tilt which nodded with the motion of the\nwheels, and at a point in it over the driver's head was a hook to which\nthe reins were hitched at times, when they formed a catenary curve from\nthe horse's shoulders.  Somewhere about the axles was a loose chain,\nwhose only known purpose was to clink as it went.  Mrs. Dollery, having\nto hop up and down many times in the service of her passengers, wore,\nespecially in windy weather, short leggings under her gown for\nmodesty's sake, and instead of a bonnet a felt hat tied down with a\nhandkerchief, to guard against an earache to which she was frequently\nsubject.  In the rear of the van was a glass window, which she cleaned\nwith her pocket-handkerchief every market-day before starting.  Looking\nat the van from the back, the spectator could thus see through its\ninterior a square piece of the same sky and landscape that he saw\nwithout, but intruded on by the profiles of the seated passengers, who,\nas they rumbled onward, their lips moving and heads nodding in animated\nprivate converse, remained in happy unconsciousness that their\nmannerisms and facial peculiarities were sharply defined to the public\neye.\n\nThis hour of coming home from market was the happy one, if not the\nhappiest, of the week for them.  Snugly ensconced under the tilt, they\ncould forget the sorrows of the world without, and survey life and\nrecapitulate the incidents of the day with placid smiles.\n\nThe passengers in the back part formed a group to themselves, and while\nthe new-comer spoke to the proprietress, they indulged in a\nconfidential chat about him as about other people, which the noise of\nthe van rendered inaudible to himself and Mrs. Dollery, sitting forward.\n\n\"'Tis Barber Percombe--he that's got the waxen woman in his window at\nthe top of Abbey Street,\" said one.  \"What business can bring him from\nhis shop out here at this time and not a journeyman hair-cutter, but a\nmaster-barber that's left off his pole because 'tis not genteel!\"\n\nThey listened to his conversation, but Mr. Percombe, though he had\nnodded and spoken genially, seemed indisposed to gratify the curiosity\nwhich he had aroused; and the unrestrained flow of ideas which had\nanimated the inside of the van before his arrival was checked\nthenceforward.\n\nThus they rode on till they turned into a half-invisible little lane,\nwhence, as it reached the verge of an eminence, could be discerned in\nthe dusk, about half a mile to the right, gardens and orchards sunk in\na concave, and, as it were, snipped out of the woodland.  From this\nself-contained place rose in stealthy silence tall stems of smoke,\nwhich the eye of imagination could trace downward to their root on\nquiet hearth-stones festooned overhead with hams and flitches.  It was\none of those sequestered spots outside the gates of the world where may\nusually be found more meditation than action, and more passivity than\nmeditation; where reasoning proceeds on narrow premises, and results in\ninferences wildly imaginative; yet where, from time to time, no less\nthan in other places, dramas of a grandeur and unity truly Sophoclean\nare enacted in the real, by virtue of the concentrated passions and\nclosely knit interdependence of the lives therein.\n\nThis place was the Little Hintock of the master-barber's search. The\ncoming night gradually obscured the smoke of the chimneys, but the\nposition of the sequestered little world could still be distinguished\nby a few faint lights, winking more or less ineffectually through the\nleafless boughs, and the undiscerned songsters they bore, in the form\nof balls of feathers, at roost among them.\n\nOut of the lane followed by the van branched a yet smaller lane, at the\ncorner of which the barber alighted, Mrs. Dollery's van going on to the\nlarger village, whose superiority to the despised smaller one as an\nexemplar of the world's movements was not particularly apparent in its\nmeans of approach.\n\n\"A very clever and learned young doctor, who, they say, is in league\nwith the devil, lives in the place you be going to--not because there's\nanybody for'n to cure there, but because 'tis the middle of his\ndistrict.\"\n\nThe observation was flung at the barber by one of the women at parting,\nas a last attempt to get at his errand that way.\n\nBut he made no reply, and without further pause the pedestrian plunged\ntowards the umbrageous nook, and paced cautiously over the dead leaves\nwhich nearly buried the road or street of the hamlet. As very few\npeople except themselves passed this way after dark, a majority of the\ndenizens of Little Hintock deemed window-curtains unnecessary; and on\nthis account Mr. Percombe made it his business to stop opposite the\ncasements of each cottage that he came to, with a demeanor which showed\nthat he was endeavoring to conjecture, from the persons and things he\nobserved within, the whereabouts of somebody or other who resided here.\n\nOnly the smaller dwellings interested him; one or two houses, whose\nsize, antiquity, and rambling appurtenances signified that\nnotwithstanding their remoteness they must formerly have been, if they\nwere not still, inhabited by people of a certain social standing, being\nneglected by him entirely.  Smells of pomace, and the hiss of\nfermenting cider, which reached him from the back quarters of other\ntenements, revealed the recent occupation of some of the inhabitants,\nand joined with the scent of decay from the perishing leaves underfoot.\n\nHalf a dozen dwellings were passed without result.  The next, which\nstood opposite a tall tree, was in an exceptional state of radiance,\nthe flickering brightness from the inside shining up the chimney and\nmaking a luminous mist of the emerging smoke.  The interior, as seen\nthrough the window, caused him to draw up with a terminative air and\nwatch.  The house was rather large for a cottage, and the door, which\nopened immediately into the living-room, stood ajar, so that a ribbon\nof light fell through the opening into the dark atmosphere without.\nEvery now and then a moth, decrepit from the late season, would flit\nfor a moment across the out-coming rays and disappear again into the\nnight.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nIn the room from which this cheerful blaze proceeded, he beheld a girl\nseated on a willow chair, and busily occupied by the light of the fire,\nwhich was ample and of wood.  With a bill-hook in one hand and a\nleather glove, much too large for her, on the other, she was making\nspars, such as are used by thatchers, with great rapidity.  She wore a\nleather apron for this purpose, which was also much too large for her\nfigure.  On her left hand lay a bundle of the straight, smooth sticks\ncalled spar-gads--the raw material of her manufacture; on her right, a\nheap of chips and ends--the refuse--with which the fire was maintained;\nin front, a pile of the finished articles.  To produce them she took up\neach gad, looked critically at it from end to end, cut it to length,\nsplit it into four, and sharpened each of the quarters with dexterous\nblows, which brought it to a triangular point precisely resembling that\nof a bayonet.\n\nBeside her, in case she might require more light, a brass candlestick\nstood on a little round table, curiously formed of an old coffin-stool,\nwith a deal top nailed on, the white surface of the latter contrasting\noddly with the black carved oak of the substructure.  The social\nposition of the household in the past was almost as definitively shown\nby the presence of this article as that of an esquire or nobleman by\nhis old helmets or shields. It had been customary for every well-to-do\nvillager, whose tenure was by copy of court-roll, or in any way more\npermanent than that of the mere cotter, to keep a pair of these stools\nfor the use of his own dead; but for the last generation or two a\nfeeling of cui bono had led to the discontinuance of the custom, and\nthe stools were frequently made use of in the manner described.\n\nThe young woman laid down the bill-hook for a moment and examined the\npalm of her right hand, which, unlike the other, was ungloved, and\nshowed little hardness or roughness about it.  The palm was red and\nblistering, as if this present occupation were not frequent enough with\nher to subdue it to what it worked in.  As with so many right hands\nborn to manual labor, there was nothing in its fundamental shape to\nbear out the physiological conventionalism that gradations of birth,\ngentle or mean, show themselves primarily in the form of this member.\nNothing but a cast of the die of destiny had decided that the girl\nshould handle the tool; and the fingers which clasped the heavy ash\nhaft might have skilfully guided the pencil or swept the string, had\nthey only been set to do it in good time.\n\nHer face had the usual fulness of expression which is developed by a\nlife of solitude.  Where the eyes of a multitude beat like waves upon a\ncountenance they seem to wear away its individuality; but in the still\nwater of privacy every tentacle of feeling and sentiment shoots out in\nvisible luxuriance, to be interpreted as readily as a child's look by\nan intruder.  In years she was no more than nineteen or twenty, but the\nnecessity of taking thought at a too early period of life had forced\nthe provisional curves of her childhood's face to a premature finality.\nThus she had but little pretension to beauty, save in one prominent\nparticular--her hair.  Its abundance made it almost unmanageable; its\ncolor was, roughly speaking, and as seen here by firelight, brown, but\ncareful notice, or an observation by day, would have revealed that its\ntrue shade was a rare and beautiful approximation to chestnut.\n\nOn this one bright gift of Time to the particular victim of his now\nbefore us the new-comer's eyes were fixed; meanwhile the fingers of his\nright hand mechanically played over something sticking up from his\nwaistcoat-pocket--the bows of a pair of scissors, whose polish made\nthem feebly responsive to the light within.  In her present beholder's\nmind the scene formed by the girlish spar-maker composed itself into a\npost-Raffaelite picture of extremest quality, wherein the girl's hair\nalone, as the focus of observation, was depicted with intensity and\ndistinctness, and her face, shoulders, hands, and figure in general,\nbeing a blurred mass of unimportant detail lost in haze and obscurity.\n\nHe hesitated no longer, but tapped at the door and entered.  The young\nwoman turned at the crunch of his boots on the sanded floor, and\nexclaiming, \"Oh, Mr. Percombe, how you frightened me!\" quite lost her\ncolor for a moment.\n\nHe replied, \"You should shut your door--then you'd hear folk open it.\"\n\n\"I can't,\" she said; \"the chimney smokes so.  Mr. Percombe, you look as\nunnatural out of your shop as a canary in a thorn-hedge. Surely you\nhave not come out here on my account--for--\"\n\n\"Yes--to have your answer about this.\" He touched her head with his\ncane, and she winced.  \"Do you agree?\" he continued.  \"It is necessary\nthat I should know at once, as the lady is soon going away, and it\ntakes time to make up.\"\n\n\"Don't press me--it worries me.  I was in hopes you had thought no more\nof it.  I can NOT part with it--so there!\"\n\n\"Now, look here, Marty,\" said the barber, sitting down on the\ncoffin-stool table.  \"How much do you get for making these spars?\"\n\n\"Hush--father's up-stairs awake, and he don't know that I am doing his\nwork.\"\n\n\"Well, now tell me,\" said the man, more softly.  \"How much do you get?\"\n\n\"Eighteenpence a thousand,\" she said, reluctantly.\n\n\"Who are you making them for?\"\n\n\"Mr. Melbury, the timber-dealer, just below here.\"\n\n\"And how many can you make in a day?\"\n\n\"In a day and half the night, three bundles--that's a thousand and a\nhalf.\"\n\n\"Two and threepence.\" The barber paused.  \"Well, look here,\" he\ncontinued, with the remains of a calculation in his tone, which\ncalculation had been the reduction to figures of the probable monetary\nmagnetism necessary to overpower the resistant force of her present\npurse and the woman's love of comeliness, \"here's a sovereign--a gold\nsovereign, almost new.\" He held it out between his finger and thumb.\n\"That's as much as you'd earn in a week and a half at that rough man's\nwork, and it's yours for just letting me snip off what you've got too\nmuch of.\"\n\nThe girl's bosom moved a very little.  \"Why can't the lady send to some\nother girl who don't value her hair--not to me?\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"Why, simpleton, because yours is the exact shade of her own, and 'tis\na shade you can't match by dyeing.  But you are not going to refuse me\nnow I've come all the way from Sherton o' purpose?\"\n\n\"I say I won't sell it--to you or anybody.\"\n\n\"Now listen,\" and he drew up a little closer beside her.  \"The lady is\nvery rich, and won't be particular to a few shillings; so I will\nadvance to this on my own responsibility--I'll make the one sovereign\ntwo, rather than go back empty-handed.\"\n\n\"No, no, no!\" she cried, beginning to be much agitated.  \"You are\na-tempting me, Mr. Percombe.  You go on like the Devil to Dr. Faustus\nin the penny book.  But I don't want your money, and won't agree.  Why\ndid you come? I said when you got me into your shop and urged me so\nmuch, that I didn't mean to sell my hair!\" The speaker was hot and\nstern.\n\n\"Marty, now hearken.  The lady that wants it wants it badly.  And,\nbetween you and me, you'd better let her have it.  'Twill be bad for\nyou if you don't.\"\n\n\"Bad for me? Who is she, then?\"\n\nThe barber held his tongue, and the girl repeated the question.\n\n\"I am not at liberty to tell you.  And as she is going abroad soon it\nmakes no difference who she is at all.\"\n\n\"She wants it to go abroad wi'?\"\n\nPercombe assented by a nod.  The girl regarded him reflectively.\n\"Barber Percombe,\" she said, \"I know who 'tis.  'Tis she at the\nHouse--Mrs. Charmond!\"\n\n\"That's my secret.  However, if you agree to let me have it, I'll tell\nyou in confidence.\"\n\n\"I'll certainly not let you have it unless you tell me the truth. It is\nMrs. Charmond.\"\n\nThe barber dropped his voice.  \"Well--it is.  You sat in front of her\nin church the other day, and she noticed how exactly your hair matched\nher own.  Ever since then she's been hankering for it, and at last\ndecided to get it.  As she won't wear it till she goes off abroad, she\nknows nobody will recognize the change.  I'm commissioned to get it for\nher, and then it is to be made up.  I shouldn't have vamped all these\nmiles for any less important employer.  Now, mind--'tis as much as my\nbusiness with her is worth if it should be known that I've let out her\nname; but honor between us two, Marty, and you'll say nothing that\nwould injure me?\"\n\n\"I don't wish to tell upon her,\" said Marty, coolly.  \"But my hair is\nmy own, and I'm going to keep it.\"\n\n\"Now, that's not fair, after what I've told you,\" said the nettled\nbarber.  \"You see, Marty, as you are in the same parish, and in one of\nher cottages, and your father is ill, and wouldn't like to turn out, it\nwould be as well to oblige her.  I say that as a friend.  But I won't\npress you to make up your mind to-night. You'll be coming to market\nto-morrow, I dare say, and you can call then.  If you think it over\nyou'll be inclined to bring what I want, I know.\"\n\n\"I've nothing more to say,\" she answered.\n\nHer companion saw from her manner that it was useless to urge her\nfurther by speech.  \"As you are a trusty young woman,\" he said, \"I'll\nput these sovereigns up here for ornament, that you may see how\nhandsome they are.  Bring the hair to-morrow, or return the\nsovereigns.\" He stuck them edgewise into the frame of a small mantle\nlooking-glass.  \"I hope you'll bring it, for your sake and mine.  I\nshould have thought she could have suited herself elsewhere; but as\nit's her fancy it must be indulged if possible. If you cut it off\nyourself, mind how you do it so as to keep all the locks one way.\" He\nshowed her how this was to be done.\n\n\"But I sha'nt,\" she replied, with laconic indifference.  \"I value my\nlooks too much to spoil 'em.  She wants my hair to get another lover\nwith; though if stories are true she's broke the heart of many a noble\ngentleman already.\"\n\n\"Lord, it's wonderful how you guess things, Marty,\" said the barber.\n\"I've had it from them that know that there certainly is some foreign\ngentleman in her eye.  However, mind what I ask.\"\n\n\"She's not going to get him through me.\"\n\nPercombe had retired as far as the door; he came back, planted his cane\non the coffin-stool, and looked her in the face.  \"Marty South,\" he\nsaid, with deliberate emphasis, \"YOU'VE GOT A LOVER YOURSELF, and\nthat's why you won't let it go!\"\n\nShe reddened so intensely as to pass the mild blush that suffices to\nheighten beauty; she put the yellow leather glove on one hand, took up\nthe hook with the other, and sat down doggedly to her work without\nturning her face to him again.  He regarded her head for a moment, went\nto the door, and with one look back at her, departed on his way\nhomeward.\n\nMarty pursued her occupation for a few minutes, then suddenly laying\ndown the bill-hook, she jumped up and went to the back of the room,\nwhere she opened a door which disclosed a staircase so whitely scrubbed\nthat the grain of the wood was wellnigh sodden away by such cleansing.\nAt the top she gently approached a bedroom, and without entering, said,\n\"Father, do you want anything?\"\n\nA weak voice inside answered in the negative; adding, \"I should be all\nright by to-morrow if it were not for the tree!\"\n\n\"The tree again--always the tree! Oh, father, don't worry so about\nthat.  You know it can do you no harm.\"\n\n\"Who have ye had talking to ye down-stairs?\"\n\n\"A Sherton man called--nothing to trouble about,\" she said, soothingly.\n\"Father,\" she went on, \"can Mrs. Charmond turn us out of our house if\nshe's minded to?\"\n\n\"Turn us out? No.  Nobody can turn us out till my poor soul is turned\nout of my body.  'Tis life-hold, like Ambrose Winterborne's.  But when\nmy life drops 'twill be hers--not till then.\" His words on this subject\nso far had been rational and firm enough.  But now he lapsed into his\nmoaning strain: \"And the tree will do it--that tree will soon be the\ndeath of me.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, you know better.  How can it be?\" She refrained from further\nspeech, and descended to the ground-floor again.\n\n\"Thank Heaven, then,\" she said to herself, \"what belongs to me I keep.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nThe lights in the village went out, house after house, till there only\nremained two in the darkness.  One of these came from a residence on\nthe hill-side, of which there is nothing to say at present; the other\nshone from the window of Marty South. Precisely the same outward effect\nwas produced here, however, by her rising when the clock struck ten and\nhanging up a thick cloth curtain.  The door it was necessary to keep\najar in hers, as in most cottages, because of the smoke; but she\nobviated the effect of the ribbon of light through the chink by hanging\na cloth over that also.  She was one of those people who, if they have\nto work harder than their neighbors, prefer to keep the necessity a\nsecret as far as possible; and but for the slight sounds of\nwood-splintering which came from within, no wayfarer would have\nperceived that here the cottager did not sleep as elsewhere.\n\nEleven, twelve, one o'clock struck; the heap of spars grew higher, and\nthe pile of chips and ends more bulky.  Even the light on the hill had\nnow been extinguished; but still she worked on.  When the temperature\nof the night without had fallen so low as to make her chilly, she\nopened a large blue umbrella to ward off the draught from the door.\nThe two sovereigns confronted her from the looking-glass in such a\nmanner as to suggest a pair of jaundiced eyes on the watch for an\nopportunity.  Whenever she sighed for weariness she lifted her gaze\ntowards them, but withdrew it quickly, stroking her tresses with her\nfingers for a moment, as if to assure herself that they were still\nsecure.  When the clock struck three she arose and tied up the spars\nshe had last made in a bundle resembling those that lay against the\nwall.\n\nShe wrapped round her a long red woollen cravat and opened the door.\nThe night in all its fulness met her flatly on the threshold, like the\nvery brink of an absolute void, or the antemundane Ginnung-Gap believed\nin by her Teuton forefathers. For her eyes were fresh from the blaze,\nand here there was no street-lamp or lantern to form a kindly\ntransition between the inner glare and the outer dark.  A lingering\nwind brought to her ear the creaking sound of two over-crowded branches\nin the neighboring wood which were rubbing each other into wounds, and\nother vocalized sorrows of the trees, together with the screech of\nowls, and the fluttering tumble of some awkward wood-pigeon\nill-balanced on its roosting-bough.\n\nBut the pupils of her young eyes soon expanded, and she could see well\nenough for her purpose.  Taking a bundle of spars under each arm, and\nguided by the serrated line of tree-tops against the sky, she went some\nhundred yards or more down the lane till she reached a long open shed,\ncarpeted around with the dead leaves that lay about everywhere.  Night,\nthat strange personality, which within walls brings ominous\nintrospectiveness and self-distrust, but under the open sky banishes\nsuch subjective anxieties as too trivial for thought, inspired Marty\nSouth with a less perturbed and brisker manner now.  She laid the spars\non the ground within the shed and returned for more, going to and fro\ntill her whole manufactured stock were deposited here.\n\nThis erection was the wagon-house of the chief man of business\nhereabout, Mr. George Melbury, the timber, bark, and copse-ware\nmerchant for whom Marty's father did work of this sort by the piece.\nIt formed one of the many rambling out-houses which surrounded his\ndwelling, an equally irregular block of building, whose immense\nchimneys could just be discerned even now.  The four huge wagons under\nthe shed were built on those ancient lines whose proportions have been\nousted by modern patterns, their shapes bulging and curving at the base\nand ends like Trafalgar line-of-battle ships, with which venerable\nhulks, indeed, these vehicles evidenced a constructed spirit curiously\nin harmony.  One was laden with sheep-cribs, another with hurdles,\nanother with ash poles, and the fourth, at the foot of which she had\nplaced her thatching-spars was half full of similar bundles.\n\nShe was pausing a moment with that easeful sense of accomplishment\nwhich follows work done that has been a hard struggle in the doing,\nwhen she heard a woman's voice on the other side of the hedge say,\nanxiously, \"George!\" In a moment the name was repeated, with \"Do come\nindoors! What are you doing there?\"\n\nThe cart-house adjoined the garden, and before Marty had moved she saw\nenter the latter from the timber-merchant's back door an elderly woman\nsheltering a candle with her hand, the light from which cast a moving\nthorn-pattern of shade on Marty's face.  Its rays soon fell upon a man\nwhose clothes were roughly thrown on, standing in advance of the\nspeaker.  He was a thin, slightly stooping figure, with a small nervous\nmouth and a face cleanly shaven; and he walked along the path with his\neyes bent on the ground.  In the pair Marty South recognized her\nemployer Melbury and his wife.  She was the second Mrs. Melbury, the\nfirst having died shortly after the birth of the timber-merchant's only\nchild.\n\n\"'Tis no use to stay in bed,\" he said, as soon as she came up to where\nhe was pacing restlessly about.  \"I can't sleep--I keep thinking of\nthings, and worrying about the girl, till I'm quite in a fever of\nanxiety.\"  He went on to say that he could not think why \"she (Marty\nknew he was speaking of his daughter) did not answer his letter.  She\nmust be ill--she must, certainly,\" he said.\n\n\"No, no.  'Tis all right, George,\" said his wife; and she assured him\nthat such things always did appear so gloomy in the night-time, if\npeople allowed their minds to run on them; that when morning came it\nwas seen that such fears were nothing but shadows. \"Grace is as well as\nyou or I,\" she declared.\n\nBut he persisted that she did not see all--that she did not see as much\nas he.  His daughter's not writing was only one part of his worry.  On\naccount of her he was anxious concerning money affairs, which he would\nnever alarm his mind about otherwise.  The reason he gave was that, as\nshe had nobody to depend upon for a provision but himself, he wished\nher, when he was gone, to be securely out of risk of poverty.\n\nTo this Mrs. Melbury replied that Grace would be sure to marry well,\nand that hence a hundred pounds more or less from him would not make\nmuch difference.\n\nHer husband said that that was what she, Mrs. Melbury, naturally\nthought; but there she was wrong, and in that lay the source of his\ntrouble.  \"I have a plan in my head about her,\" he said; \"and according\nto my plan she won't marry a rich man.\"\n\n\"A plan for her not to marry well?\" said his wife, surprised.\n\n\"Well, in one sense it is that,\" replied Melbury.  \"It is a plan for\nher to marry a particular person, and as he has not so much money as\nshe might expect, it might be called as you call it.  I may not be able\nto carry it out; and even if I do, it may not be a good thing for her.\nI want her to marry Giles Winterborne.\"\n\nHis companion repeated the name.  \"Well, it is all right,\" she said,\npresently.  \"He adores the very ground she walks on; only he's close,\nand won't show it much.\"\n\nMarty South appeared startled, and could not tear herself away.\n\nYes, the timber-merchant asserted, he knew that well enough.\nWinterborne had been interested in his daughter for years; that was\nwhat had led him into the notion of their union.  And he knew that she\nused to have no objection to him.  But it was not any difficulty about\nthat which embarrassed him.  It was that, since he had educated her so\nwell, and so long, and so far above the level of daughters thereabout,\nit was \"wasting her\" to give her to a man of no higher standing than\nthe young man in question.\n\n\"That's what I have been thinking,\" said Mrs. Melbury.\n\n\"Well, then, Lucy, now you've hit it,\" answered the timber-merchant,\nwith feeling.  \"There lies my trouble.  I vowed to let her marry him,\nand to make her as valuable as I could to him by schooling her as many\nyears and as thoroughly as possible.  I mean to keep my vow.  I made it\nbecause I did his father a terrible wrong; and it was a weight on my\nconscience ever since that time till this scheme of making amends\noccurred to me through seeing that Giles liked her.\"\n\n\"Wronged his father?\" asked Mrs. Melbury.\n\n\"Yes, grievously wronged him,\" said her husband.\n\n\"Well, don't think of it to-night,\" she urged.  \"Come indoors.\"\n\n\"No, no, the air cools my head.  I shall not stay long.\" He was silent\na while; then he told her, as nearly as Marty could gather, that his\nfirst wife, his daughter Grace's mother, was first the sweetheart of\nWinterborne's father, who loved her tenderly, till he, the speaker, won\nher away from him by a trick, because he wanted to marry her himself.\nHe sadly went on to say that the other man's happiness was ruined by\nit; that though he married Winterborne's mother, it was but a\nhalf-hearted business with him. Melbury added that he was afterwards\nvery miserable at what he had done; but that as time went on, and the\nchildren grew up, and seemed to be attached to each other, he\ndetermined to do all he could to right the wrong by letting his\ndaughter marry the lad; not only that, but to give her the best\neducation he could afford, so as to make the gift as valuable a one as\nit lay in his power to bestow.  \"I still mean to do it,\" said Melbury.\n\n\"Then do,\" said she.\n\n\"But all these things trouble me,\" said he; \"for I feel I am\nsacrificing her for my own sin; and I think of her, and often come down\nhere and look at this.\"\n\n\"Look at what?\" asked his wife.\n\nHe took the candle from her hand, held it to the ground, and removed a\ntile which lay in the garden-path.  \"'Tis the track of her shoe that\nshe made when she ran down here the day before she went away all those\nmonths ago.  I covered it up when she was gone; and when I come here\nand look at it, I ask myself again, why should she be sacrificed to a\npoor man?\"\n\n\"It is not altogether a sacrifice,\" said the woman.  \"He is in love\nwith her, and he's honest and upright.  If she encourages him, what can\nyou wish for more?\"\n\n\"I wish for nothing definite.  But there's a lot of things possible for\nher.  Why, Mrs. Charmond is wanting some refined young lady, I hear, to\ngo abroad with her--as companion or something of the kind.  She'd jump\nat Grace.\"\n\n\"That's all uncertain.  Better stick to what's sure.\"\n\n\"True, true,\" said Melbury; \"and I hope it will be for the best. Yes,\nlet me get 'em married up as soon as I can, so as to have it over and\ndone with.\" He continued looking at the imprint, while he added,\n\"Suppose she should be dying, and never make a track on this path any\nmore?\"\n\n\"She'll write soon, depend upon't.  Come, 'tis wrong to stay here and\nbrood so.\"\n\nHe admitted it, but said he could not help it.  \"Whether she write or\nno, I shall fetch her in a few days.\" And thus speaking, he covered the\ntrack, and preceded his wife indoors.\n\nMelbury, perhaps, was an unlucky man in having within him the sentiment\nwhich could indulge in this foolish fondness about the imprint of a\ndaughter's footstep.  Nature does not carry on her government with a\nview to such feelings, and when advancing years render the open hearts\nof those who possess them less dexterous than formerly in shutting\nagainst the blast, they must suffer \"buffeting at will by rain and\nstorm\" no less than Little Celandines.\n\nBut her own existence, and not Mr. Melbury's, was the centre of Marty's\nconsciousness, and it was in relation to this that the matter struck\nher as she slowly withdrew.\n\n\"That, then, is the secret of it all,\" she said.  \"And Giles\nWinterborne is not for me, and the less I think of him the better.\"\n\nShe returned to her cottage.  The sovereigns were staring at her from\nthe looking-glass as she had left them.  With a preoccupied\ncountenance, and with tears in her eyes, she got a pair of scissors,\nand began mercilessly cutting off the long locks of her hair, arranging\nand tying them with their points all one way, as the barber had\ndirected.  Upon the pale scrubbed deal of the coffin-stool table they\nstretched like waving and ropy weeds over the washed gravel-bed of a\nclear stream.\n\nShe would not turn again to the little looking-glass, out of humanity\nto herself, knowing what a deflowered visage would look back at her,\nand almost break her heart; she dreaded it as much as did her own\nancestral goddess Sif the reflection in the pool after the rape of her\nlocks by Loke the malicious.  She steadily stuck to business, wrapped\nthe hair in a parcel, and sealed it up, after which she raked out the\nfire and went to bed, having first set up an alarum made of a candle\nand piece of thread, with a stone attached.\n\nBut such a reminder was unnecessary to-night.  Having tossed till about\nfive o'clock, Marty heard the sparrows walking down their long holes in\nthe thatch above her sloping ceiling to their orifice at the eaves;\nwhereupon she also arose, and descended to the ground-floor again.\n\nIt was still dark, but she began moving about the house in those\nautomatic initiatory acts and touches which represent among housewives\nthe installation of another day.  While thus engaged she heard the\nrumbling of Mr. Melbury's wagons, and knew that there, too, the day's\ntoil had begun.\n\nAn armful of gads thrown on the still hot embers caused them to blaze\nup cheerfully and bring her diminished head-gear into sudden prominence\nas a shadow.  At this a step approached the door.\n\n\"Are folk astir here yet?\" inquired a voice she knew well.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Winterborne,\" said Marty, throwing on a tilt bonnet, which\ncompletely hid the recent ravages of the scissors.  \"Come in!\"\n\nThe door was flung back, and there stepped in upon the mat a man not\nparticularly young for a lover, nor particularly mature for a person of\naffairs.  There was reserve in his glance, and restraint upon his\nmouth.  He carried a horn lantern which hung upon a swivel, and\nwheeling as it dangled marked grotesque shapes upon the shadier part of\nthe walls.\n\nHe said that he had looked in on his way down, to tell her that they\ndid not expect her father to make up his contract if he was not well.\nMr. Melbury would give him another week, and they would go their\njourney with a short load that day.\n\n\"They are done,\" said Marty, \"and lying in the cart-house.\"\n\n\"Done!\" he repeated.  \"Your father has not been too ill to work after\nall, then?\"\n\nShe made some evasive reply.  \"I'll show you where they be, if you are\ngoing down,\" she added.\n\nThey went out and walked together, the pattern of the air-holes in the\ntop of the lantern being thrown upon the mist overhead, where they\nappeared of giant size, as if reaching the tent-shaped sky. They had no\nremarks to make to each other, and they uttered none. Hardly anything\ncould be more isolated or more self-contained than the lives of these\ntwo walking here in the lonely antelucan hour, when gray shades,\nmaterial and mental, are so very gray.  And yet, looked at in a certain\nway, their lonely courses formed no detached design at all, but were\npart of the pattern in the great web of human doings then weaving in\nboth hemispheres, from the White Sea to Cape Horn.\n\nThe shed was reached, and she pointed out the spars.  Winterborne\nregarded them silently, then looked at her.\n\n\"Now, Marty, I believe--\" he said, and shook his head.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"That you've done the work yourself.\"\n\n\"Don't you tell anybody, will you, Mr. Winterborne?\" she pleaded, by\nway of answer.  \"Because I am afraid Mr. Melbury may refuse my work if\nhe knows it is mine.\"\n\n\"But how could you learn to do it? 'Tis a trade.\"\n\n\"Trade!\" said she.  \"I'd be bound to learn it in two hours.\"\n\n\"Oh no, you wouldn't, Mrs. Marty.\" Winterborne held down his lantern,\nand examined the cleanly split hazels as they lay. \"Marty,\" he said,\nwith dry admiration, \"your father with his forty years of practice\nnever made a spar better than that.  They are too good for the\nthatching of houses--they are good enough for the furniture.  But I\nwon't tell.  Let me look at your hands--your poor hands!\"\n\nHe had a kindly manner of a quietly severe tone; and when she seemed\nreluctant to show her hands, he took hold of one and examined it as if\nit were his own.  Her fingers were blistered.\n\n\"They'll get harder in time,\" she said.  \"For if father continues ill,\nI shall have to go on wi' it.  Now I'll help put 'em up in wagon.\"\n\nWinterborne without speaking set down his lantern, lifted her as she\nwas about to stoop over the bundles, placed her behind him, and began\nthrowing up the bundles himself.  \"Rather than you should do it I\nwill,\" he said.  \"But the men will be here directly.  Why,\nMarty!--whatever has happened to your head? Lord, it has shrunk to\nnothing--it looks an apple upon a gate-post!\"\n\nHer heart swelled, and she could not speak.  At length she managed to\ngroan, looking on the ground, \"I've made myself ugly--and\nhateful--that's what I've done!\"\n\n\"No, no,\" he answered.  \"You've only cut your hair--I see now.\"\n\n\"Then why must you needs say that about apples and gate-posts?\"\n\n\"Let me see.\"\n\n\"No, no!\" She ran off into the gloom of the sluggish dawn.  He did not\nattempt to follow her.  When she reached her father's door she stood on\nthe step and looked back.  Mr. Melbury's men had arrived, and were\nloading up the spars, and their lanterns appeared from the distance at\nwhich she stood to have wan circles round them, like eyes weary with\nwatching.  She observed them for a few seconds as they set about\nharnessing the horses, and then went indoors.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nThere was now a distinct manifestation of morning in the air, and\npresently the bleared white visage of a sunless winter day emerged like\na dead-born child.  The villagers everywhere had already bestirred\nthemselves, rising at this time of the year at the far less dreary hour\nof absolute darkness.  It had been above an hour earlier, before a\nsingle bird had untucked his head, that twenty lights were struck in as\nmany bedrooms, twenty pairs of shutters opened, and twenty pairs of\neyes stretched to the sky to forecast the weather for the day.\n\nOwls that had been catching mice in the out-houses, rabbits that had\nbeen eating the wintergreens in the gardens, and stoats that had been\nsucking the blood of the rabbits, discerning that their human neighbors\nwere on the move, discreetly withdrew from publicity, and were seen and\nheard no more that day.\n\nThe daylight revealed the whole of Mr. Melbury's homestead, of which\nthe wagon-sheds had been an outlying erection.  It formed three sides\nof an open quadrangle, and consisted of all sorts of buildings, the\nlargest and central one being the dwelling itself. The fourth side of\nthe quadrangle was the public road.\n\nIt was a dwelling-house of respectable, roomy, almost dignified aspect;\nwhich, taken with the fact that there were the remains of other such\nbuildings thereabout, indicated that Little Hintock had at some time or\nother been of greater importance than now, as its old name of Hintock\nSt. Osmond also testified.  The house was of no marked antiquity, yet\nof well-advanced age; older than a stale novelty, but no canonized\nantique; faded, not hoary; looking at you from the still distinct\nmiddle-distance of the early Georgian time, and awakening on that\naccount the instincts of reminiscence more decidedly than the remoter\nand far grander memorials which have to speak from the misty reaches of\nmediaevalism.  The faces, dress, passions, gratitudes, and revenues of\nthe great-great-grandfathers and grandmothers who had been the first to\ngaze from those rectangular windows, and had stood under that\nkey-stoned doorway, could be divined and measured by homely standards\nof to-day.  It was a house in whose reverberations queer old personal\ntales were yet audible if properly listened for; and not, as with those\nof the castle and cloister, silent beyond the possibility of echo.\n\nThe garden-front remained much as it had always been, and there was a\nporch and entrance that way.  But the principal house-door opened on\nthe square yard or quadrangle towards the road, formerly a regular\ncarriage entrance, though the middle of the area was now made use of\nfor stacking timber, fagots, bundles, and other products of the wood.\nIt was divided from the lane by a lichen-coated wall, in which hung a\npair of gates, flanked by piers out of the perpendicular, with a round\nwhite ball on the top of each.\n\nThe building on the left of the enclosure was a long-backed erection,\nnow used for spar-making, sawing, crib-framing, and copse-ware\nmanufacture in general.  Opposite were the wagon-sheds where Marty had\ndeposited her spars.\n\nHere Winterborne had remained after the girl's abrupt departure, to see\nthat the wagon-loads were properly made up.  Winterborne was connected\nwith the Melbury family in various ways.  In addition to the\nsentimental relationship which arose from his father having been the\nfirst Mrs. Melbury's lover, Winterborne's aunt had married and\nemigrated with the brother of the timber-merchant many years before--an\nalliance that was sufficient to place Winterborne, though the poorer,\non a footing of social intimacy with the Melburys.  As in most villages\nso secluded as this, intermarriages were of Hapsburgian frequency among\nthe inhabitants, and there were hardly two houses in Little Hintock\nunrelated by some matrimonial tie or other.\n\nFor this reason a curious kind of partnership existed between Melbury\nand the younger man--a partnership based upon an unwritten code, by\nwhich each acted in the way he thought fair towards the other, on a\ngive-and-take principle.  Melbury, with his timber and copse-ware\nbusiness, found that the weight of his labor came in winter and spring.\nWinterborne was in the apple and cider trade, and his requirements in\ncartage and other work came in the autumn of each year.  Hence horses,\nwagons, and in some degree men, were handed over to him when the apples\nbegan to fall; he, in return, lending his assistance to Melbury in the\nbusiest wood-cutting season, as now.\n\nBefore he had left the shed a boy came from the house to ask him to\nremain till Mr. Melbury had seen him.  Winterborne thereupon crossed\nover to the spar-house where two or three men were already at work, two\nof them being travelling spar-makers from White-hart Lane, who, when\nthis kind of work began, made their appearance regularly, and when it\nwas over disappeared in silence till the season came again.\n\nFirewood was the one thing abundant in Little Hintock; and a blaze of\ngad-cuds made the outhouse gay with its light, which vied with that of\nthe day as yet.  In the hollow shades of the roof could be seen\ndangling etiolated arms of ivy which had crept through the joints of\nthe tiles and were groping in vain for some support, their leaves being\ndwarfed and sickly for want of sunlight; others were pushing in with\nsuch force at the eaves as to lift from their supports the shelves that\nwere fixed there.\n\nBesides the itinerant journey-workers there were also present John\nUpjohn, engaged in the hollow-turnery trade, who lived hard by; old\nTimothy Tangs and young Timothy Tangs, top and bottom sawyers, at work\nin Mr. Melbury's pit outside; Farmer Bawtree, who kept the cider-house,\nand Robert Creedle, an old man who worked for Winterborne, and stood\nwarming his hands; these latter being enticed in by the ruddy blaze,\nthough they had no particular business there.  None of them call for\nany remark except, perhaps, Creedle.  To have completely described him\nit would have been necessary to write a military memoir, for he wore\nunder his smock-frock a cast-off soldier's jacket that had seen hot\nservice, its collar showing just above the flap of the frock; also a\nhunting memoir, to include the top-boots that he had picked up by\nchance; also chronicles of voyaging and shipwreck, for his pocket-knife\nhad been given him by a weather-beaten sailor.  But Creedle carried\nabout with him on his uneventful rounds these silent testimonies of\nwar, sport, and adventure, and thought nothing of their associations or\ntheir stories.\n\nCopse-work, as it was called, being an occupation which the secondary\nintelligence of the hands and arms could carry on without requiring the\nsovereign attention of the head, the minds of its professors wandered\nconsiderably from the objects before them; hence the tales, chronicles,\nand ramifications of family history which were recounted here were of a\nvery exhaustive kind, and sometimes so interminable as to defy\ndescription.\n\nWinterborne, seeing that Melbury had not arrived, stepped back again\noutside the door; and the conversation interrupted by his momentary\npresence flowed anew, reaching his ears as an accompaniment to the\nregular dripping of the fog from the plantation boughs around.\n\nThe topic at present handled was a highly popular and frequent one--the\npersonal character of Mrs. Charmond, the owner of the surrounding woods\nand groves.\n\n\"My brother-in-law told me, and I have no reason to doubt it,\" said\nCreedle, \"that she'd sit down to her dinner with a frock hardly higher\nthan her elbows.  'Oh, you wicked woman!' he said to himself when he\nfirst see her, 'you go to your church, and sit, and kneel, as if your\nknee-jints were greased with very saint's anointment, and tell off your\nHear-us-good-Lords like a business man counting money; and yet you can\neat your victuals such a figure as that!' Whether she's a reformed\ncharacter by this time I can't say; but I don't care who the man is,\nthat's how she went on when my brother-in-law lived there.\"\n\n\"Did she do it in her husband's time?\"\n\n\"That I don't know--hardly, I should think, considering his temper.\nAh!\" Here Creedle threw grieved remembrance into physical form by\nslowly resigning his head to obliquity and letting his eyes water.\n\"That man! 'Not if the angels of heaven come down, Creedle,' he said,\n'shall you do another day's work for me!' Yes--he'd say\nanything--anything; and would as soon take a winged creature's name in\nvain as yours or mine! Well, now I must get these spars home-along, and\nto-morrow, thank God, I must see about using 'em.\"\n\nAn old woman now entered upon the scene.  She was Mr. Melbury's\nservant, and passed a great part of her time in crossing the yard\nbetween the house-door and the spar-shed, whither she had come now for\nfuel.  She had two facial aspects--one, of a soft and flexible kind,\nshe used indoors when assisting about the parlor or upstairs; the\nother, with stiff lines and corners, when she was bustling among the\nmen in the spar-house or out-of-doors.\n\n\"Ah, Grammer Oliver,\" said John Upjohn, \"it do do my heart good to see\na old woman like you so dapper and stirring, when I bear in mind that\nafter fifty one year counts as two did afore! But your smoke didn't\nrise this morning till twenty minutes past seven by my beater; and\nthat's late, Grammer Oliver.\"\n\n\"If you was a full-sized man, John, people might take notice of your\nscornful meanings.  But your growing up was such a scrimped and scanty\nbusiness that really a woman couldn't feel hurt if you were to spit\nfire and brimstone itself at her.  Here,\" she added, holding out a\nspar-gad to one of the workmen, from which dangled a long\nblack-pudding--\"here's something for thy breakfast, and if you want tea\nyou must fetch it from in-doors.\"\n\n\"Mr. Melbury is late this morning,\" said the bottom-sawyer.\n\n\"Yes.  'Twas a dark dawn,\" said Mrs. Oliver.  \"Even when I opened the\ndoor, so late as I was, you couldn't have told poor men from gentlemen,\nor John from a reasonable-sized object.  And I don't think maister's\nslept at all well to-night.  He's anxious about his daughter; and I\nknow what that is, for I've cried bucketfuls for my own.\"\n\nWhen the old woman had gone Creedle said,\n\n\"He'll fret his gizzard green if he don't soon hear from that maid of\nhis.  Well, learning is better than houses and lands.  But to keep a\nmaid at school till she is taller out of pattens than her mother was in\n'em--'tis tempting Providence.\"\n\n\"It seems no time ago that she was a little playward girl,\" said young\nTimothy Tangs.\n\n\"I can mind her mother,\" said the hollow-turner.  \"Always a teuny,\ndelicate piece; her touch upon your hand was as soft and cool as wind.\nShe was inoculated for the small-pox and had it beautifully fine, just\nabout the time that I was out of my apprenticeship--ay, and a long\napprenticeship 'twas.  I served that master of mine six years and three\nhundred and fourteen days.\"\n\nThe hollow-turner pronounced the days with emphasis, as if, considering\ntheir number, they were a rather more remarkable fact than the years.\n\n\"Mr. Winterborne's father walked with her at one time,\" said old\nTimothy Tangs.  \"But Mr. Melbury won her.  She was a child of a woman,\nand would cry like rain if so be he huffed her.  Whenever she and her\nhusband came to a puddle in their walks together he'd take her up like\na half-penny doll and put her over without dirting her a speck.  And if\nhe keeps the daughter so long at boarding-school, he'll make her as\nnesh as her mother was.  But here he comes.\"\n\nJust before this moment Winterborne had seen Melbury crossing the court\nfrom his door.  He was carrying an open letter in his hand, and came\nstraight to Winterborne.  His gloom of the preceding night had quite\ngone.\n\n\"I'd no sooner made up my mind, Giles, to go and see why Grace didn't\ncome or write than I get a letter from her--'Clifton: Wednesday.  My\ndear father,' says she, 'I'm coming home to-morrow' (that's to-day),\n'but I didn't think it worth while to write long beforehand.' The\nlittle rascal, and didn't she! Now, Giles, as you are going to Sherton\nmarket to-day with your apple-trees, why not join me and Grace there,\nand we'll drive home all together?\"\n\nHe made the proposal with cheerful energy; he was hardly the same man\nas the man of the small dark hours.  Ever it happens that even among\nthe moodiest the tendency to be cheered is stronger than the tendency\nto be cast down; and a soul's specific gravity stands permanently less\nthan that of the sea of troubles into which it is thrown.\n\nWinterborne, though not demonstrative, replied to this suggestion with\nsomething like alacrity.  There was not much doubt that Marty's grounds\nfor cutting off her hair were substantial enough, if Ambrose's eyes had\nbeen a reason for keeping it on.  As for the timber-merchant, it was\nplain that his invitation had been given solely in pursuance of his\nscheme for uniting the pair.  He had made up his mind to the course as\na duty, and was strenuously bent upon following it out.\n\nAccompanied by Winterborne, he now turned towards the door of the\nspar-house, when his footsteps were heard by the men as aforesaid.\n\n\"Well, John, and Lot,\" he said, nodding as he entered.  \"A rimy\nmorning.\"\n\n\"'Tis, sir!\" said Creedle, energetically; for, not having as yet been\nable to summon force sufficient to go away and begin work, he felt the\nnecessity of throwing some into his speech.  \"I don't care who the man\nis, 'tis the rimiest morning we've had this fall.\"\n\n\"I heard you wondering why I've kept my daughter so long at\nboarding-school,\" resumed Mr. Melbury, looking up from the letter which\nhe was reading anew by the fire, and turning to them with the\nsuddenness that was a trait in him.  \"Hey?\" he asked, with affected\nshrewdness.  \"But you did, you know.  Well, now, though it is my own\nbusiness more than anybody else's, I'll tell ye. When I was a boy,\nanother boy--the pa'son's son--along with a lot of others, asked me\n'Who dragged Whom round the walls of What?' and I said, 'Sam Barrett,\nwho dragged his wife in a chair round the tower corner when she went to\nbe churched.' They laughed at me with such torrents of scorn that I\nwent home ashamed, and couldn't sleep for shame; and I cried that night\ntill my pillow was wet: till at last I thought to myself there and\nthen--'They may laugh at me for my ignorance, but that was father's\nfault, and none o' my making, and I must bear it.  But they shall never\nlaugh at my children, if I have any: I'll starve first!' Thank God,\nI've been able to keep her at school without sacrifice; and her\nscholarship is such that she stayed on as governess for a time.  Let\n'em laugh now if they can: Mrs. Charmond herself is not better informed\nthan my girl Grace.\"\n\nThere was something between high indifference and humble emotion in his\ndelivery, which made it difficult for them to reply. Winterborne's\ninterest was of a kind which did not show itself in words; listening,\nhe stood by the fire, mechanically stirring the embers with a spar-gad.\n\n\"You'll be, then, ready, Giles?\" Melbury continued, awaking from a\nreverie.  \"Well, what was the latest news at Shottsford yesterday, Mr.\nBawtree?\"\n\n\"Well, Shottsford is Shottsford still--you can't victual your carcass\nthere unless you've got money; and you can't buy a cup of genuine\nthere, whether or no....But as the saying is, 'Go abroad and you'll\nhear news of home.' It seems that our new neighbor, this young Dr.\nWhat's-his-name, is a strange, deep, perusing gentleman; and there's\ngood reason for supposing he has sold his soul to the wicked one.\"\n\n\"'Od name it all,\" murmured the timber-merchant, unimpressed by the\nnews, but reminded of other things by the subject of it; \"I've got to\nmeet a gentleman this very morning? and yet I've planned to go to\nSherton Abbas for the maid.\"\n\n\"I won't praise the doctor's wisdom till I hear what sort of bargain\nhe's made,\" said the top-sawyer.\n\n\"'Tis only an old woman's tale,\" said Bawtree.  \"But it seems that he\nwanted certain books on some mysterious science or black-art, and in\norder that the people hereabout should not know anything about his dark\nreadings, he ordered 'em direct from London, and not from the Sherton\nbook-seller.  The parcel was delivered by mistake at the pa'son's, and\nhe wasn't at home; so his wife opened it, and went into hysterics when\nshe read 'em, thinking her husband had turned heathen, and 'twould be\nthe ruin of the children.  But when he came he said he knew no more\nabout 'em than she; and found they were this Mr. Fitzpier's property.\nSo he wrote 'Beware!' outside, and sent 'em on by the sexton.\"\n\n\"He must be a curious young man,\" mused the hollow-turner.\n\n\"He must,\" said Timothy Tangs.\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said Mr. Melbury, authoritatively, \"he's only a gentleman\nfond of science and philosophy and poetry, and, in fact, every kind of\nknowledge; and being lonely here, he passes his time in making such\nmatters his hobby.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said old Timothy, \"'tis a strange thing about doctors that the\nworse they be the better they be.  I mean that if you hear anything of\nthis sort about 'em, ten to one they can cure ye as nobody else can.\"\n\n\"True,\" said Bawtree, emphatically.  \"And for my part I shall take my\ncustom from old Jones and go to this one directly I've anything the\nmatter with me.  That last medicine old Jones gave me had no taste in\nit at all.\"\n\nMr. Melbury, as became a well-informed man, did not listen to these\nrecitals, being moreover preoccupied with the business appointment\nwhich had come into his head.  He walked up and down, looking on the\nfloor--his usual custom when undecided.  That stiffness about the arm,\nhip, and knee-joint which was apparent when he walked was the net\nproduct of the divers sprains and over-exertions that had been required\nof him in handling trees and timber when a young man, for he was of the\nsort called self-made, and had worked hard.  He knew the origin of\nevery one of these cramps: that in his left shoulder had come of\ncarrying a pollard, unassisted, from Tutcombe Bottom home; that in one\nleg was caused by the crash of an elm against it when they were\nfelling; that in the other was from lifting a bole.  On many a morrow\nafter wearying himself by these prodigious muscular efforts, he had\nrisen from his bed fresh as usual; his lassitude had departed,\napparently forever; and confident in the recuperative power of his\nyouth, he had repeated the strains anew.  But treacherous Time had been\nonly hiding ill results when they could be guarded against, for greater\naccumulation when they could not.  In his declining years the store had\nbeen unfolded in the form of rheumatisms, pricks, and spasms, in every\none of which Melbury recognized some act which, had its consequence\nbeen contemporaneously made known, he would wisely have abstained from\nrepeating.\n\nOn a summons by Grammer Oliver to breakfast, he left the shed. Reaching\nthe kitchen, where the family breakfasted in winter to save\nhouse-labor, he sat down by the fire, and looked a long time at the\npair of dancing shadows cast by each fire-iron and dog-knob on the\nwhitewashed chimney-corner--a yellow one from the window, and a blue\none from the fire.\n\n\"I don't quite know what to do to-day,\" he said to his wife at last.\n\"I've recollected that I promised to meet Mrs. Charmond's steward in\nRound Wood at twelve o'clock, and yet I want to go for Grace.\"\n\n\"Why not let Giles fetch her by himself? 'Twill bring 'em together all\nthe quicker.\"\n\n\"I could do that--but I should like to go myself.  I always have gone,\nwithout fail, every time hitherto.  It has been a great pleasure to\ndrive into Sherton, and wait and see her arrive; and perhaps she'll be\ndisappointed if I stay away.\"\n\n\"You may be disappointed, but I don't think she will, if you send\nGiles,\" said Mrs. Melbury, dryly.\n\n\"Very well--I'll send him.\"\n\nMelbury was often persuaded by the quietude of his wife's words when\nstrenuous argument would have had no effect.  This second Mrs. Melbury\nwas a placid woman, who had been nurse to his child Grace before her\nmother's death.  After that melancholy event little Grace had clung to\nthe nurse with much affection; and ultimately Melbury, in dread lest\nthe only woman who cared for the girl should be induced to leave her,\npersuaded the mild Lucy to marry him.  The arrangement--for it was\nlittle more--had worked satisfactorily enough; Grace had thriven, and\nMelbury had not repented.\n\nHe returned to the spar-house and found Giles near at hand, to whom he\nexplained the change of plan.  \"As she won't arrive till five o'clock,\nyou can get your business very well over in time to receive her,\" said\nMelbury.  \"The green gig will do for her; you'll spin along quicker\nwith that, and won't be late upon the road.  Her boxes can be called\nfor by one of the wagons.\"\n\nWinterborne, knowing nothing of the timber-merchant's restitutory aims,\nquietly thought all this to be a kindly chance.  Wishing even more than\nher father to despatch his apple-tree business in the market before\nGrace's arrival, he prepared to start at once.\n\nMelbury was careful that the turnout should be seemly.  The gig-wheels,\nfor instance, were not always washed during winter-time before a\njourney, the muddy roads rendering that labor useless; but they were\nwashed to-day.  The harness was blacked, and when the rather elderly\nwhite horse had been put in, and Winterborne was in his seat ready to\nstart, Mr. Melbury stepped out with a blacking-brush, and with his own\nhands touched over the yellow hoofs of the animal.\n\n\"You see, Giles,\" he said, as he blacked, \"coming from a fashionable\nschool, she might feel shocked at the homeliness of home; and 'tis\nthese little things that catch a dainty woman's eye if they are\nneglected.  We, living here alone, don't notice how the whitey-brown\ncreeps out of the earth over us; but she, fresh from a city--why,\nshe'll notice everything!\"\n\n\"That she will,\" said Giles.\n\n\"And scorn us if we don't mind.\"\n\n\"Not scorn us.\"\n\n\"No, no, no--that's only words.  She's too good a girl to do that. But\nwhen we consider what she knows, and what she has seen since she last\nsaw us, 'tis as well to meet her views as nearly as possible.  Why,\n'tis a year since she was in this old place, owing to her going abroad\nin the summer, which I agreed to, thinking it best for her; and\nnaturally we shall look small, just at first--I only say just at first.\"\n\nMr. Melbury's tone evinced a certain exultation in the very sense of\nthat inferiority he affected to deplore; for this advanced and refined\nbeing, was she not his own all the time?  Not so Giles; he felt\ndoubtful--perhaps a trifle cynical--for that strand was wound into him\nwith the rest.  He looked at his clothes with misgiving, then with\nindifference.\n\nIt was his custom during the planting season to carry a specimen\napple-tree to market with him as an advertisement of what he dealt in.\nThis had been tied across the gig; and as it would be left behind in\nthe town, it would cause no inconvenience to Miss Grace Melbury coming\nhome.\n\nHe drove away, the twigs nodding with each step of the horse; and\nMelbury went in-doors.  Before the gig had passed out of sight, Mr.\nMelbury reappeared and shouted after--\n\n\"Here, Giles,\" he said, breathlessly following with some wraps, \"it may\nbe very chilly to-night, and she may want something extra about her.\nAnd, Giles,\" he added, when the young man, having taken the articles,\nput the horse in motion once more, \"tell her that I should have come\nmyself, but I had particular business with Mrs. Charmond's agent, which\nprevented me.  Don't forget.\"\n\nHe watched Winterborne out of sight, saying, with a jerk--a shape into\nwhich emotion with him often resolved itself--\"There, now, I hope the\ntwo will bring it to a point and have done with it! 'Tis a pity to let\nsuch a girl throw herself away upon him--a thousand pities!...And yet\n'tis my duty for his father's sake.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nWinterborne sped on his way to Sherton Abbas without elation and\nwithout discomposure.  Had he regarded his inner self spectacularly, as\nlovers are now daily more wont to do, he might have felt pride in the\ndiscernment of a somewhat rare power in him--that of keeping not only\njudgment but emotion suspended in difficult cases.  But he noted it\nnot.  Neither did he observe what was also the fact, that though he\ncherished a true and warm feeling towards Grace Melbury, he was not\naltogether her fool just now.  It must be remembered that he had not\nseen her for a year.\n\nArrived at the entrance to a long flat lane, which had taken the spirit\nout of many a pedestrian in times when, with the majority, to travel\nmeant to walk, he saw before him the trim figure of a young woman in\npattens, journeying with that steadfast concentration which means\npurpose and not pleasure.  He was soon near enough to see that she was\nMarty South.  Click, click, click went the pattens; and she did not\nturn her head.\n\nShe had, however, become aware before this that the driver of the\napproaching gig was Giles.  She had shrunk from being overtaken by him\nthus; but as it was inevitable, she had braced herself up for his\ninspection by closing her lips so as to make her mouth quite\nunemotional, and by throwing an additional firmness into her tread.\n\n\"Why do you wear pattens, Marty? The turnpike is clean enough, although\nthe lanes are muddy.\"\n\n\"They save my boots.\"\n\n\"But twelve miles in pattens--'twill twist your feet off.  Come, get up\nand ride with me.\"\n\nShe hesitated, removed her pattens, knocked the gravel out of them\nagainst the wheel, and mounted in front of the nodding specimen\napple-tree.  She had so arranged her bonnet with a full border and\ntrimmings that her lack of long hair did not much injure her\nappearance; though Giles, of course, saw that it was gone, and may have\nguessed her motive in parting with it, such sales, though infrequent,\nbeing not unheard of in that locality.\n\nBut nature's adornment was still hard by--in fact, within two feet of\nhim, though he did not know it.  In Marty's basket was a brown paper\npacket, and in the packet the chestnut locks, which, by reason of the\nbarber's request for secrecy, she had not ventured to intrust to other\nhands.\n\nGiles asked, with some hesitation, how her father was getting on.\n\nHe was better, she said; he would be able to work in a day or two; he\nwould be quite well but for his craze about the tree falling on him.\n\n\"You know why I don't ask for him so often as I might, I suppose?\" said\nWinterborne.  \"Or don't you know?\"\n\n\"I think I do.\"\n\n\"Because of the houses?\"\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"Yes.  I am afraid it may seem that my anxiety is about those houses,\nwhich I should lose by his death, more than about him. Marty, I do feel\nanxious about the houses, since half my income depends upon them; but I\ndo likewise care for him; and it almost seems wrong that houses should\nbe leased for lives, so as to lead to such mixed feelings.\"\n\n\"After father's death they will be Mrs. Charmond's?\"\n\n\"They'll be hers.\"\n\n\"They are going to keep company with my hair,\" she thought.\n\nThus talking, they reached the town.  By no pressure would she ride up\nthe street with him.  \"That's the right of another woman,\" she said,\nwith playful malice, as she put on her pattens.  \"I wonder what you are\nthinking of! Thank you for the lift in that handsome gig.  Good-by.\"\n\nHe blushed a little, shook his head at her, and drove on ahead into the\nstreets--the churches, the abbey, and other buildings on this clear\nbright morning having the liny distinctness of architectural drawings,\nas if the original dream and vision of the conceiving master-mason,\nsome mediaeval Vilars or other unknown to fame, were for a few minutes\nflashed down through the centuries to an unappreciative age.  Giles saw\ntheir eloquent look on this day of transparency, but could not construe\nit.  He turned into the inn-yard.\n\nMarty, following the same track, marched promptly to the\nhair-dresser's, Mr. Percombe's.  Percombe was the chief of his trade in\nSherton Abbas.  He had the patronage of such county offshoots as had\nbeen obliged to seek the shelter of small houses in that ancient town,\nof the local clergy, and so on, for some of whom he had made wigs,\nwhile others among them had compensated for neglecting him in their\nlifetime by patronizing him when they were dead, and letting him shave\ntheir corpses.  On the strength of all this he had taken down his pole,\nand called himself \"Perruquier to the aristocracy.\"\n\nNevertheless, this sort of support did not quite fill his children's\nmouths, and they had to be filled.  So, behind his house there was a\nlittle yard, reached by a passage from the back street, and in that\nyard was a pole, and under the pole a shop of quite another description\nthan the ornamental one in the front street.  Here on Saturday nights\nfrom seven till ten he took an almost innumerable succession of\ntwopences from the farm laborers who flocked thither in crowds from the\ncountry.  And thus he lived.\n\nMarty, of course, went to the front shop, and handed her packet to him\nsilently.  \"Thank you,\" said the barber, quite joyfully.  \"I hardly\nexpected it after what you said last night.\"\n\nShe turned aside, while a tear welled up and stood in each eye at this\nreminder.\n\n\"Nothing of what I told you,\" he whispered, there being others in the\nshop.  \"But I can trust you, I see.\"\n\nShe had now reached the end of this distressing business, and went\nlistlessly along the street to attend to other errands.  These occupied\nher till four o'clock, at which time she recrossed the market-place.\nIt was impossible to avoid rediscovering Winterborne every time she\npassed that way, for standing, as he always did at this season of the\nyear, with his specimen apple-tree in the midst, the boughs rose above\nthe heads of the crowd, and brought a delightful suggestion of orchards\namong the crowded buildings there.  When her eye fell upon him for the\nlast time he was standing somewhat apart, holding the tree like an\nensign, and looking on the ground instead of pushing his produce as he\nought to have been doing.  He was, in fact, not a very successful\nseller either of his trees or of his cider, his habit of speaking his\nmind, when he spoke at all, militating against this branch of his\nbusiness.\n\nWhile she regarded him he suddenly lifted his eyes in a direction away\nfrom Marty, his face simultaneously kindling with recognition and\nsurprise.  She followed his gaze, and saw walking across to him a\nflexible young creature in whom she perceived the features of her she\nhad known as Miss Grace Melbury, but now looking glorified and refined\nabove her former level.  Winterborne, being fixed to the spot by his\napple-tree, could not advance to meet her; he held out his spare hand\nwith his hat in it, and with some embarrassment beheld her coming on\ntiptoe through the mud to the middle of the square where he stood.\n\nMiss Melbury's arrival so early was, as Marty could see, unexpected by\nGiles, which accounted for his not being ready to receive her.  Indeed,\nher father had named five o'clock as her probable time, for which\nreason that hour had been looming out all the day in his forward\nperspective, like an important edifice on a plain.  Now here she was\ncome, he knew not how, and his arranged welcome stultified.\n\nHis face became gloomy at her necessity for stepping into the road, and\nmore still at the little look of embarrassment which appeared on hers\nat having to perform the meeting with him under an apple-tree ten feet\nhigh in the middle of the market-place. Having had occasion to take off\nthe new gloves she had bought to come home in, she held out to him a\nhand graduating from pink at the tips of the fingers to white at the\npalm; and the reception formed a scene, with the tree over their heads,\nwhich was not by any means an ordinary one in Sherton Abbas streets.\n\nNevertheless, the greeting on her looks and lips was of a restrained\ntype, which perhaps was not unnatural.  For true it was that Giles\nWinterborne, well-attired and well-mannered as he was for a yeoman,\nlooked rough beside her.  It had sometimes dimly occurred to him, in\nhis ruminating silence at Little Hintock, that external phenomena--such\nas the lowness or height or color of a hat, the fold of a coat, the\nmake of a boot, or the chance attitude or occupation of a limb at the\ninstant of view--may have a great influence upon feminine opinion of a\nman's worth--so frequently founded on non-essentials; but a certain\ncausticity of mental tone towards himself and the world in general had\nprevented to-day, as always, any enthusiastic action on the strength of\nthat reflection; and her momentary instinct of reserve at first sight\nof him was the penalty he paid for his laxness.\n\nHe gave away the tree to a by-stander, as soon as he could find one who\nwould accept the cumbersome gift, and the twain moved on towards the\ninn at which he had put up.  Marty made as if to step forward for the\npleasure of being recognized by Miss Melbury; but abruptly checking\nherself, she glided behind a carrier's van, saying, dryly, \"No; I baint\nwanted there,\" and critically regarded Winterborne's companion.\n\nIt would have been very difficult to describe Grace Melbury with\nprecision, either now or at any time.  Nay, from the highest point of\nview, to precisely describe a human being, the focus of a universe--how\nimpossible! But, apart from transcendentalism, there never probably\nlived a person who was in herself more completely a reductio ad\nabsurdum of attempts to appraise a woman, even externally, by items of\nface and figure.  Speaking generally, it may be said that she was\nsometimes beautiful, at other times not beautiful, according to the\nstate of her health and spirits.\n\nIn simple corporeal presentment she was of a fair and clear complexion,\nrather pale than pink, slim in build and elastic in movement.  Her look\nexpressed a tendency to wait for others' thoughts before uttering her\nown; possibly also to wait for others' deeds before her own doing.  In\nher small, delicate mouth, which had perhaps hardly settled down to its\nmatured curves, there was a gentleness that might hinder sufficient\nself-assertion for her own good.  She had well-formed eyebrows which,\nhad her portrait been painted, would probably have been done in Prout's\nor Vandyke brown.\n\nThere was nothing remarkable in her dress just now, beyond a natural\nfitness and a style that was recent for the streets of Sherton.  But,\nindeed, had it been the reverse, and quite striking, it would have\nmeant just as little.  For there can be hardly anything less connected\nwith a woman's personality than drapery which she has neither designed,\nmanufactured, cut, sewed, or even seen, except by a glance of approval\nwhen told that such and such a shape and color must be had because it\nhas been decided by others as imperative at that particular time.\n\nWhat people, therefore, saw of her in a cursory view was very little;\nin truth, mainly something that was not she.  The woman herself was a\nshadowy, conjectural creature who had little to do with the outlines\npresented to Sherton eyes; a shape in the gloom, whose true description\ncould only be approximated by putting together a movement now and a\nglance then, in that patient and long-continued attentiveness which\nnothing but watchful loving-kindness ever troubles to give.\n\n\nThere was a little delay in their setting out from the town, and Marty\nSouth took advantage of it to hasten forward, with the view of escaping\nthem on the way, lest they should feel compelled to spoil their\ntete-a-tete by asking her to ride.  She walked fast, and one-third of\nthe journey was done, and the evening rapidly darkening, before she\nperceived any sign of them behind her. Then, while ascending a hill,\nshe dimly saw their vehicle drawing near the lowest part of the\nincline, their heads slightly bent towards each other; drawn together,\nno doubt, by their souls, as the heads of a pair of horses well in hand\nare drawn in by the rein.  She walked still faster.\n\nBut between these and herself there was a carriage, apparently a\nbrougham, coming in the same direction, with lighted lamps.  When it\novertook her--which was not soon, on account of her pace--the scene was\nmuch darker, and the lights glared in her eyes sufficiently to hide the\ndetails of the equipage.\n\nIt occurred to Marty that she might take hold behind this carriage and\nso keep along with it, to save herself the mortification of being\novertaken and picked up for pity's sake by the coming pair.\nAccordingly, as the carriage drew abreast of her in climbing the long\nascent, she walked close to the wheels, the rays of the nearest lamp\npenetrating her very pores.  She had only just dropped behind when the\ncarriage stopped, and to her surprise the coachman asked her, over his\nshoulder, if she would ride.  What made the question more surprising\nwas that it came in obedience to an order from the interior of the\nvehicle.\n\nMarty gladly assented, for she was weary, very weary, after working all\nnight and keeping afoot all day.  She mounted beside the coachman,\nwondering why this good-fortune had happened to her. He was rather a\ngreat man in aspect, and she did not like to inquire of him for some\ntime.\n\nAt last she said, \"Who has been so kind as to ask me to ride?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Charmond,\" replied her statuesque companion.\n\nMarty was stirred at the name, so closely connected with her last\nnight's experiences.  \"Is this her carriage?\" she whispered.\n\n\"Yes; she's inside.\"\n\nMarty reflected, and perceived that Mrs. Charmond must have recognized\nher plodding up the hill under the blaze of the lamp; recognized,\nprobably, her stubbly poll (since she had kept away her face), and\nthought that those stubbles were the result of her own desire.\n\nMarty South was not so very far wrong.  Inside the carriage a pair of\nbright eyes looked from a ripely handsome face, and though behind those\nbright eyes was a mind of unfathomed mysteries, beneath them there beat\na heart capable of quick extempore warmth--a heart which could, indeed,\nbe passionately and imprudently warm on certain occasions.  At present,\nafter recognizing the girl, she had acted on a mere impulse, possibly\nfeeling gratified at the denuded appearance which signified the success\nof her agent in obtaining what she had required.\n\n\"'Tis wonderful that she should ask ye,\" observed the magisterial\ncoachman, presently.  \"I have never known her do it before, for as a\nrule she takes no interest in the village folk at all.\"\n\nMarty said no more, but occasionally turned her head to see if she\ncould get a glimpse of the Olympian creature who as the coachman had\ntruly observed, hardly ever descended from her clouds into the Tempe of\nthe parishioners.  But she could discern nothing of the lady.  She also\nlooked for Miss Melbury and Winterborne.  The nose of their horse\nsometimes came quite near the back of Mrs. Charmond's carriage.  But\nthey never attempted to pass it till the latter conveyance turned\ntowards the park gate, when they sped by. Here the carriage drew up\nthat the gate might be opened, and in the momentary silence Marty heard\na gentle oral sound, soft as a breeze.\n\n\"What's that?\" she whispered.\n\n\"Mis'ess yawning.\"\n\n\"Why should she yawn?\"\n\n\"Oh, because she's been used to such wonderfully good life, and finds\nit dull here.  She'll soon be off again on account of it.\"\n\n\"So rich and so powerful, and yet to yawn!\" the girl murmured. \"Then\nthings don't fay with she any more than with we!\"\n\nMarty now alighted; the lamp again shone upon her, and as the carriage\nrolled on, a soft voice said to her from the interior, \"Good-night.\"\n\n\"Good-night, ma'am,\" said Marty.  But she had not been able to see the\nwoman who began so greatly to interest her--the second person of her\nown sex who had operated strongly on her mind that day.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nMeanwhile, Winterborne and Grace Melbury had also undergone their\nlittle experiences of the same homeward journey.\n\nAs he drove off with her out of the town the glances of people fell\nupon them, the younger thinking that Mr. Winterborne was in a pleasant\nplace, and wondering in what relation he stood towards her.\nWinterborne himself was unconscious of this.  Occupied solely with the\nidea of having her in charge, he did not notice much with outward eye,\nneither observing how she was dressed, nor the effect of the picture\nthey together composed in the landscape.\n\nTheir conversation was in briefest phrase for some time, Grace being\nsomewhat disconcerted, through not having understood till they were\nabout to start that Giles was to be her sole conductor in place of her\nfather.  When they were in the open country he spoke.\n\n\"Don't Brownley's farm-buildings look strange to you, now they have\nbeen moved bodily from the hollow where the old ones stood to the top\nof the hill?\"\n\nShe admitted that they did, though she should not have seen any\ndifference in them if he had not pointed it out.\n\n\"They had a good crop of bitter-sweets; they couldn't grind them all\"\n(nodding towards an orchard where some heaps of apples had been left\nlying ever since the ingathering).\n\nShe said \"Yes,\" but looking at another orchard.\n\n\"Why, you are looking at John-apple-trees! You know bitter-sweets--you\nused to well enough!\"\n\n\"I am afraid I have forgotten, and it is getting too dark to\ndistinguish.\"\n\nWinterborne did not continue.  It seemed as if the knowledge and\ninterest which had formerly moved Grace's mind had quite died away from\nher.  He wondered whether the special attributes of his image in the\npast had evaporated like these other things.\n\nHowever that might be, the fact at present was merely this, that where\nhe was seeing John-apples and farm-buildings she was beholding a far\nremoter scene--a scene no less innocent and simple, indeed, but much\ncontrasting--a broad lawn in the fashionable suburb of a fast city, the\nevergreen leaves shining in the evening sun, amid which bounding girls,\ngracefully clad in artistic arrangements of blue, brown, red, black,\nand white, were playing at games, with laughter and chat, in all the\npride of life, the notes of piano and harp trembling in the air from\nthe open windows adjoining.  Moreover, they were girls--and this was a\nfact which Grace Melbury's delicate femininity could not lose sight\nof--whose parents Giles would have addressed with a deferential Sir or\nMadam.  Beside this visioned scene the homely farmsteads did not quite\nhold their own from her present twenty-year point of survey.  For all\nhis woodland sequestration, Giles knew the primitive simplicity of the\nsubject he had started, and now sounded a deeper note.\n\n\"'Twas very odd what we said to each other years ago; I often think of\nit.  I mean our saying that if we still liked each other when you were\ntwenty and I twenty-five, we'd--\"\n\n\"It was child's tattle.\"\n\n\"H'm!\" said Giles, suddenly.\n\n\"I mean we were young,\" said she, more considerately.  That gruff\nmanner of his in making inquiries reminded her that he was unaltered in\nmuch.\n\n\"Yes....I beg your pardon, Miss Melbury; your father SENT me to meet\nyou to-day.\"\n\n\"I know it, and I am glad of it.\"\n\nHe seemed satisfied with her tone and went on: \"At that time you were\nsitting beside me at the back of your father's covered car, when we\nwere coming home from gypsying, all the party being squeezed in\ntogether as tight as sheep in an auction-pen.  It got darker and\ndarker, and I said--I forget the exact words--but I put my arm round\nyour waist and there you let it stay till your father, sitting in front\nsuddenly stopped telling his story to Farmer Bollen, to light his pipe.\nThe flash shone into the car, and showed us all up distinctly; my arm\nflew from your waist like lightning; yet not so quickly but that some\nof 'em had seen, and laughed at us.  Yet your father, to our amazement,\ninstead of being angry, was mild as milk, and seemed quite pleased.\nHave you forgot all that, or haven't you?\"\n\nShe owned that she remembered it very well, now that he mentioned the\ncircumstances.  \"But, goodness! I must have been in short frocks,\" she\nsaid.\n\n\"Come now, Miss Melbury, that won't do! Short frocks, indeed! You know\nbetter, as well as I.\"\n\nGrace thereupon declared that she would not argue with an old friend\nshe valued so highly as she valued him, saying the words with the easy\nelusiveness that will be polite at all costs.  It might possibly be\ntrue, she added, that she was getting on in girlhood when that event\ntook place; but if it were so, then she was virtually no less than an\nold woman now, so far did the time seem removed from her present.  \"Do\nyou ever look at things philosophically instead of personally?\" she\nasked.\n\n\"I can't say that I do,\" answered Giles, his eyes lingering far ahead\nupon a dark spot, which proved to be a brougham.\n\n\"I think you may, sometimes, with advantage,\" said she.  \"Look at\nyourself as a pitcher drifting on the stream with other pitchers, and\nconsider what contrivances are most desirable for avoiding cracks in\ngeneral, and not only for saving your poor one.  Shall I tell you all\nabout Bath or Cheltenham, or places on the Continent that I visited\nlast summer?\"\n\n\"With all my heart.\"\n\nShe then described places and persons in such terms as might have been\nused for that purpose by any woman to any man within the four seas, so\nentirely absent from that description was everything specially\nappertaining to her own existence.  When she had done she said, gayly,\n\"Now do you tell me in return what has happened in Hintock since I have\nbeen away.\"\n\n\"Anything to keep the conversation away from her and me,\" said Giles\nwithin him.\n\nIt was true cultivation had so far advanced in the soil of Miss\nMelbury's mind as to lead her to talk by rote of anything save of that\nshe knew well, and had the greatest interest in developing--that is to\nsay, herself.\n\nHe had not proceeded far with his somewhat bald narration when they\ndrew near the carriage that had been preceding them for some time.\nMiss Melbury inquired if he knew whose carriage it was.\n\nWinterborne, although he had seen it, had not taken it into account.\nOn examination, he said it was Mrs. Charmond's.\n\nGrace watched the vehicle and its easy roll, and seemed to feel more\nnearly akin to it than to the one she was in.\n\n\"Pooh! We can polish off the mileage as well as they, come to that,\"\nsaid Winterborne, reading her mind; and rising to emulation at what it\nbespoke, he whipped on the horse.  This it was which had brought the\nnose of Mr. Melbury's old gray close to the back of Mrs. Charmond's\nmuch-eclipsing vehicle.\n\n\"There's Marty South sitting up with the coachman,\" said he, discerning\nher by her dress.\n\n\"Ah, poor Marty! I must ask her to come to see me this very evening.\nHow does she happen to be riding there?\"\n\n\"I don't know.  It is very singular.\"\n\nThus these people with converging destinies went along the road\ntogether, till Winterborne, leaving the track of the carriage, turned\ninto Little Hintock, where almost the first house was the\ntimber-merchant's.  Pencils of dancing light streamed out of the\nwindows sufficiently to show the white laurestinus flowers, and glance\nover the polished leaves of laurel.  The interior of the rooms could be\nseen distinctly, warmed up by the fire-flames, which in the parlor were\nreflected from the glass of the pictures and bookcase, and in the\nkitchen from the utensils and ware.\n\n\"Let us look at the dear place for a moment before we call them,\" she\nsaid.\n\nIn the kitchen dinner was preparing; for though Melbury dined at one\no'clock at other times, to-day the meal had been kept back for Grace.\nA rickety old spit was in motion, its end being fixed in the fire-dog,\nand the whole kept going by means of a cord conveyed over pulleys along\nthe ceiling to a large stone suspended in a corner of the room.  Old\nGrammer Oliver came and wound it up with a rattle like that of a mill.\n\nIn the parlor a large shade of Mrs. Melbury's head fell on the wall and\nceiling; but before the girl had regarded this room many moments their\npresence was discovered, and her father and stepmother came out to\nwelcome her.\n\nThe character of the Melbury family was of that kind which evinces some\nshyness in showing strong emotion among each other: a trait frequent in\nrural households, and one which stands in curiously inverse relation to\nmost of the peculiarities distinguishing villagers from the people of\ntowns.  Thus hiding their warmer feelings under commonplace talk all\nround, Grace's reception produced no extraordinary demonstrations.  But\nthat more was felt than was enacted appeared from the fact that her\nfather, in taking her in-doors, quite forgot the presence of Giles\nwithout, as did also Grace herself.  He said nothing, but took the gig\nround to the yard and called out from the spar-house the man who\nparticularly attended to these matters when there was no conversation\nto draw him off among the copse-workers inside. Winterborne then\nreturned to the door with the intention of entering the house.\n\nThe family had gone into the parlor, and were still absorbed in\nthemselves.  The fire was, as before, the only light, and it irradiated\nGrace's face and hands so as to make them look wondrously smooth and\nfair beside those of the two elders; shining also through the loose\nhair about her temples as sunlight through a brake.  Her father was\nsurveying her in a dazed conjecture, so much had she developed and\nprogressed in manner and stature since he last had set eyes on her.\n\nObserving these things, Winterborne remained dubious by the door,\nmechanically tracing with his fingers certain time-worn letters carved\nin the jambs--initials of by-gone generations of householders who had\nlived and died there.\n\nNo, he declared to himself, he would not enter and join the family;\nthey had forgotten him, and it was enough for to-day that he had\nbrought her home.  Still, he was a little surprised that her father's\neagerness to send him for Grace should have resulted in such an\nanticlimax as this.\n\nHe walked softly away into the lane towards his own house, looking back\nwhen he reached the turning, from which he could get a last glimpse of\nthe timber-merchant's roof.  He hazarded guesses as to what Grace was\nsaying just at that moment, and murmured, with some self-derision,\n\"nothing about me!\" He looked also in the other direction, and saw\nagainst the sky the thatched hip and solitary chimney of Marty's\ncottage, and thought of her too, struggling bravely along under that\nhumble shelter, among her spar-gads and pots and skimmers.\n\nAt the timber-merchant's, in the mean time, the conversation flowed;\nand, as Giles Winterborne had rightly enough deemed, on subjects in\nwhich he had no share.  Among the excluding matters there was, for one,\nthe effect upon Mr. Melbury of the womanly mien and manners of his\ndaughter, which took him so much unawares that, though it did not make\nhim absolutely forget the existence of her conductor homeward, thrust\nGiles's image back into quite the obscurest cellarage of his brain.\nAnother was his interview with Mrs. Charmond's agent that morning, at\nwhich the lady herself had been present for a few minutes.  Melbury had\npurchased some standing timber from her a long time before, and now\nthat the date had come for felling it he was left to pursue almost his\nown course.  This was what the household were actually talking of\nduring Giles's cogitation without; and Melbury's satisfaction with the\nclear atmosphere that had arisen between himself and the deity of the\ngroves which enclosed his residence was the cause of a counterbalancing\nmistiness on the side towards Winterborne.\n\n\"So thoroughly does she trust me,\" said Melbury, \"that I might fell,\ntop, or lop, on my own judgment, any stick o' timber whatever in her\nwood, and fix the price o't, and settle the matter.  But, name it all!\nI wouldn't do such a thing.  However, it may be useful to have this\ngood understanding with her....I wish she took more interest in the\nplace, and stayed here all the year round.\"\n\n\"I am afraid 'tis not her regard for you, but her dislike of Hintock,\nthat makes her so easy about the trees,\" said Mrs. Melbury.\n\nWhen dinner was over, Grace took a candle and began to ramble\npleasurably through the rooms of her old home, from which she had\nlatterly become wellnigh an alien.  Each nook and each object revived a\nmemory, and simultaneously modified it.  The chambers seemed lower than\nthey had appeared on any previous occasion of her return, the surfaces\nof both walls and ceilings standing in such relations to the eye that\nit could not avoid taking microscopic note of their irregularities and\nold fashion.  Her own bedroom wore at once a look more familiar than\nwhen she had left it, and yet a face estranged.  The world of little\nthings therein gazed at her in helpless stationariness, as though they\nhad tried and been unable to make any progress without her presence.\nOver the place where her candle had been accustomed to stand, when she\nhad used to read in bed till the midnight hour, there was still the\nbrown spot of smoke.  She did not know that her father had taken\nespecial care to keep it from being cleaned off.\n\nHaving concluded her perambulation of this now uselessly commodious\nedifice, Grace began to feel that she had come a long journey since the\nmorning; and when her father had been up himself, as well as his wife,\nto see that her room was comfortable and the fire burning, she prepared\nto retire for the night.  No sooner, however, was she in bed than her\nmomentary sleepiness took itself off, and she wished she had stayed up\nlonger.  She amused herself by listening to the old familiar noises\nthat she could hear to be still going on down-stairs, and by looking\ntowards the window as she lay.  The blind had been drawn up, as she\nused to have it when a girl, and she could just discern the dim\ntree-tops against the sky on the neighboring hill.  Beneath this\nmeeting-line of light and shade nothing was visible save one solitary\npoint of light, which blinked as the tree-twigs waved to and fro before\nits beams.  From its position it seemed to radiate from the window of a\nhouse on the hill-side.  The house had been empty when she was last at\nhome, and she wondered who inhabited the place now.\n\nHer conjectures, however, were not intently carried on, and she was\nwatching the light quite idly, when it gradually changed color, and at\nlength shone blue as sapphire.  Thus it remained several minutes, and\nthen it passed through violet to red.\n\nHer curiosity was so widely awakened by the phenomenon that she sat up\nin bed, and stared steadily at the shine.  An appearance of this sort,\nsufficient to excite attention anywhere, was no less than a marvel in\nHintock, as Grace had known the hamlet.  Almost every diurnal and\nnocturnal effect in that woodland place had hitherto been the direct\nresult of the regular terrestrial roll which produced the season's\nchanges; but here was something dissociated from these normal\nsequences, and foreign to local habit and knowledge.\n\nIt was about this moment that Grace heard the household below preparing\nto retire, the most emphatic noise in the proceeding being that of her\nfather bolting the doors.  Then the stairs creaked, and her father and\nmother passed her chamber.  The last to come was Grammer Oliver.\n\nGrace slid out of bed, ran across the room, and lifting the latch,\nsaid, \"I am not asleep, Grammer.  Come in and talk to me.\"\n\nBefore the old woman had entered, Grace was again under the bedclothes.\nGrammer set down her candlestick, and seated herself on the edge of\nMiss Melbury's coverlet.\n\n\"I want you to tell me what light that is I see on the hill-side,\" said\nGrace.\n\nMrs. Oliver looked across.  \"Oh, that,\" she said, \"is from the\ndoctor's.  He's often doing things of that sort.  Perhaps you don't\nknow that we've a doctor living here now--Mr. Fitzpiers by name?\"\n\nGrace admitted that she had not heard of him.\n\n\"Well, then, miss, he's come here to get up a practice.  I know him\nvery well, through going there to help 'em scrub sometimes, which your\nfather said I might do, if I wanted to, in my spare time.  Being a\nbachelor-man, he've only a lad in the house.  Oh yes, I know him very\nwell.  Sometimes he'll talk to me as if I were his own mother.\"\n\n\"Indeed.\"\n\n\"Yes.  'Grammer,' he said one day, when I asked him why he came here\nwhere there's hardly anybody living, 'I'll tell you why I came here.  I\ntook a map, and I marked on it where Dr. Jones's practice ends to the\nnorth of this district, and where Mr. Taylor's ends on the south, and\nlittle Jimmy Green's on the east, and somebody else's to the west.\nThen I took a pair of compasses, and found the exact middle of the\ncountry that was left between these bounds, and that middle was Little\nHintock; so here I am....'  But, Lord, there: poor young man!\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"He said, 'Grammer Oliver, I've been here three months, and although\nthere are a good many people in the Hintocks and the villages round,\nand a scattered practice is often a very good one, I don't seem to get\nmany patients.  And there's no society at all; and I'm pretty near\nmelancholy mad,' he said, with a great yawn. 'I should be quite if it\nwere not for my books, and my lab--laboratory, and what not.  Grammer,\nI was made for higher things.' And then he'd yawn and yawn again.\"\n\n\"Was he really made for higher things, do you think? I mean, is he\nclever?\"\n\n\"Well, no.  How can he be clever? He may be able to jine up a broken\nman or woman after a fashion, and put his finger upon an ache if you\ntell him nearly where 'tis; but these young men--they should live to my\ntime of life, and then they'd see how clever they were at\nfive-and-twenty! And yet he's a projick, a real projick, and says the\noddest of rozums.  'Ah, Grammer,' he said, at another time, 'let me\ntell you that Everything is Nothing. There's only Me and not Me in the\nwhole world.' And he told me that no man's hands could help what they\ndid, any more than the hands of a clock....Yes, he's a man of strange\nmeditations, and his eyes seem to see as far as the north star.\"\n\n\"He will soon go away, no doubt.\"\n\n\"I don't think so.\" Grace did not say \"Why?\" and Grammer hesitated.  At\nlast she went on: \"Don't tell your father or mother, miss, if I let you\nknow a secret.\"\n\nGrace gave the required promise.\n\n\"Well, he talks of buying me; so he won't go away just yet.\"\n\n\"Buying you!--how?\"\n\n\"Not my soul--my body, when I'm dead.  One day when I was there\ncleaning, he said, 'Grammer, you've a large brain--a very large organ\nof brain,' he said.  'A woman's is usually four ounces less than a\nman's; but yours is man's size.' Well, then--hee, hee!--after he'd\nflattered me a bit like that, he said he'd give me ten pounds to have\nme as a natomy after my death.  Well, knowing I'd no chick nor chiel\nleft, and nobody with any interest in me, I thought, faith, if I can be\nof any use to my fellow-creatures after I'm gone they are welcome to my\nservices; so I said I'd think it over, and would most likely agree and\ntake the ten pounds.  Now this is a secret, miss, between us two.  The\nmoney would be very useful to me; and I see no harm in it.\"\n\n\"Of course there's no harm.  But oh, Grammer, how can you think to do\nit?  I wish you hadn't told me.\"\n\n\"I wish I hadn't--if you don't like to know it, miss.  But you needn't\nmind.  Lord--hee, hee!--I shall keep him waiting many a year yet, bless\nye!\"\n\n\"I hope you will, I am sure.\"\n\nThe girl thereupon fell into such deep reflection that conversation\nlanguished, and Grammer Oliver, taking her candle, wished Miss Melbury\ngood-night.  The latter's eyes rested on the distant glimmer, around\nwhich she allowed her reasoning fancy to play in vague eddies that\nshaped the doings of the philosopher behind that light on the lines of\nintelligence just received.  It was strange to her to come back from\nthe world to Little Hintock and find in one of its nooks, like a\ntropical plant in a hedgerow, a nucleus of advanced ideas and practices\nwhich had nothing in common with the life around.  Chemical\nexperiments, anatomical projects, and metaphysical conceptions had\nfound a strange home here.\n\nThus she remained thinking, the imagined pursuits of the man behind the\nlight intermingling with conjectural sketches of his personality, till\nher eyes fell together with their own heaviness, and she slept.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nKaleidoscopic dreams of a weird alchemist-surgeon, Grammer Oliver's\nskeleton, and the face of Giles Winterborne, brought Grace Melbury to\nthe morning of the next day.  It was fine.  A north wind was\nblowing--that not unacceptable compromise between the atmospheric\ncutlery of the eastern blast and the spongy gales of the west quarter.\nShe looked from her window in the direction of the light of the\nprevious evening, and could just discern through the trees the shape of\nthe surgeon's house.  Somehow, in the broad, practical daylight, that\nunknown and lonely gentleman seemed to be shorn of much of the interest\nwhich had invested his personality and pursuits in the hours of\ndarkness, and as Grace's dressing proceeded he faded from her mind.\n\nMeanwhile, Winterborne, though half assured of her father's favor, was\nrendered a little restless by Miss Melbury's behavior. Despite his dry\nself-control, he could not help looking continually from his own door\ntowards the timber-merchant's, in the probability of somebody's\nemergence therefrom.  His attention was at length justified by the\nappearance of two figures, that of Mr. Melbury himself, and Grace\nbeside him.  They stepped out in a direction towards the densest\nquarter of the wood, and Winterborne walked contemplatively behind\nthem, till all three were soon under the trees.\n\nAlthough the time of bare boughs had now set in, there were sheltered\nhollows amid the Hintock plantations and copses in which a more tardy\nleave-taking than on windy summits was the rule with the foliage.  This\ncaused here and there an apparent mixture of the seasons; so that in\nsome of the dells that they passed by holly-berries in full red were\nfound growing beside oak and hazel whose leaves were as yet not far\nremoved from green, and brambles whose verdure was rich and deep as in\nthe month of August.  To Grace these well-known peculiarities were as\nan old painting restored.\n\nNow could be beheld that change from the handsome to the curious which\nthe features of a wood undergo at the ingress of the winter months.\nAngles were taking the place of curves, and reticulations of\nsurfaces--a change constituting a sudden lapse from the ornate to the\nprimitive on Nature's canvas, and comparable to a retrogressive step\nfrom the art of an advanced school of painting to that of the Pacific\nIslander.\n\nWinterborne followed, and kept his eye upon the two figures as they\nthreaded their way through these sylvan phenomena.  Mr. Melbury's long\nlegs, and gaiters drawn in to the bone at the ankles, his slight stoop,\nhis habit of getting lost in thought and arousing himself with an\nexclamation of \"Hah!\" accompanied with an upward jerk of the head,\ncomposed a personage recognizable by his neighbors as far as he could\nbe seen.  It seemed as if the squirrels and birds knew him.  One of the\nformer would occasionally run from the path to hide behind the arm of\nsome tree, which the little animal carefully edged round pari passu\nwith Melbury and his daughters movement onward, assuming a mock manner,\nas though he were saying, \"Ho, ho; you are only a timber-merchant, and\ncarry no gun!\"\n\nThey went noiselessly over mats of starry moss, rustled through\ninterspersed tracts of leaves, skirted trunks with spreading roots,\nwhose mossed rinds made them like hands wearing green gloves; elbowed\nold elms and ashes with great forks, in which stood pools of water that\noverflowed on rainy days, and ran down their stems in green cascades.\nOn older trees still than these, huge lobes of fungi grew like lungs.\nHere, as everywhere, the Unfulfilled Intention, which makes life what\nit is, was as obvious as it could be among the depraved crowds of a\ncity slum.  The leaf was deformed, the curve was crippled, the taper\nwas interrupted; the lichen eat the vigor of the stalk, and the ivy\nslowly strangled to death the promising sapling.\n\nThey dived amid beeches under which nothing grew, the younger boughs\nstill retaining their hectic leaves, that rustled in the breeze with a\nsound almost metallic, like the sheet-iron foliage of the fabled\nJarnvid wood.  Some flecks of white in Grace's drapery had enabled\nGiles to keep her and her father in view till this time; but now he\nlost sight of them, and was obliged to follow by ear--no difficult\nmatter, for on the line of their course every wood-pigeon rose from its\nperch with a continued clash, dashing its wings against the branches\nwith wellnigh force enough to break every quill.  By taking the track\nof this noise he soon came to a stile.\n\nWas it worth while to go farther? He examined the doughy soil at the\nfoot of the stile, and saw among the large sole-and-heel tracks an\nimpression of a slighter kind from a boot that was obviously not local,\nfor Winterborne knew all the cobblers' patterns in that district,\nbecause they were very few to know. The mud-picture was enough to make\nhim swing himself over and proceed.\n\nThe character of the woodland now changed.  The bases of the smaller\ntrees were nibbled bare by rabbits, and at divers points heaps of\nfresh-made chips, and the newly-cut stool of a tree, stared white\nthrough the undergrowth.  There had been a large fall of timber this\nyear, which explained the meaning of some sounds that soon reached him.\n\nA voice was shouting intermittently in a sort of human bark, which\nreminded Giles that there was a sale of trees and fagots that very day.\nMelbury would naturally be present.  Thereupon Winterborne remembered\nthat he himself wanted a few fagots, and entered upon the scene.\n\nA large group of buyers stood round the auctioneer, or followed him\nwhen, between his pauses, he wandered on from one lot of plantation\nproduce to another, like some philosopher of the Peripatetic school\ndelivering his lectures in the shady groves of the Lyceum.  His\ncompanions were timber-dealers, yeomen, farmers, villagers, and others;\nmostly woodland men, who on that account could afford to be curious in\ntheir walking-sticks, which consequently exhibited various\nmonstrosities of vegetation, the chief being cork-screw shapes in black\nand white thorn, brought to that pattern by the slow torture of an\nencircling woodbine during their growth, as the Chinese have been said\nto mould human beings into grotesque toys by continued compression in\ninfancy.  Two women, wearing men's jackets on their gowns, conducted in\nthe rear of the halting procession a pony-cart containing a tapped\nbarrel of beer, from which they drew and replenished horns that were\nhanded round, with bread-and-cheese from a basket.\n\nThe auctioneer adjusted himself to circumstances by using his\nwalking-stick as a hammer, and knocked down the lot on any convenient\nobject that took his fancy, such as the crown of a little boy's head,\nor the shoulders of a by-stander who had no business there except to\ntaste the brew; a proceeding which would have been deemed humorous but\nfor the air of stern rigidity which that auctioneer's face preserved,\ntending to show that the eccentricity was a result of that absence of\nmind which is engendered by the press of affairs, and no freak of fancy\nat all.\n\nMr. Melbury stood slightly apart from the rest of the Peripatetics, and\nGrace beside him, clinging closely to his arm, her modern attire\nlooking almost odd where everything else was old-fashioned, and\nthrowing over the familiar garniture of the trees a homeliness that\nseemed to demand improvement by the addition of a few contemporary\nnovelties also.  Grace seemed to regard the selling with the interest\nwhich attaches to memories revived after an interval of obliviousness.\n\nWinterborne went and stood close to them; the timber-merchant spoke,\nand continued his buying; Grace merely smiled.  To justify his presence\nthere Winterborne began bidding for timber and fagots that he did not\nwant, pursuing the occupation in an abstracted mood, in which the\nauctioneer's voice seemed to become one of the natural sounds of the\nwoodland.  A few flakes of snow descended, at the sight of which a\nrobin, alarmed at these signs of imminent winter, and seeing that no\noffence was meant by the human invasion, came and perched on the tip of\nthe fagots that were being sold, and looked into the auctioneer's face,\nwhile waiting for some chance crumb from the bread-basket.  Standing a\nlittle behind Grace, Winterborne observed how one flake would sail\ndownward and settle on a curl of her hair, and how another would choose\nher shoulder, and another the edge of her bonnet, which took up so much\nof his attention that his biddings proceeded incoherently; and when the\nauctioneer said, every now and then, with a nod towards him, \"Yours,\nMr. Winterborne,\" he had no idea whether he had bought fagots, poles,\nor logwood.\n\nHe regretted, with some causticity of humor, that her father should\nshow such inequalities of temperament as to keep Grace tightly on his\narm to-day, when he had quite lately seemed anxious to recognize their\nbetrothal as a fact.  And thus musing, and joining in no conversation\nwith other buyers except when directly addressed, he followed the\nassemblage hither and thither till the end of the auction, when Giles\nfor the first time realized what his purchases had been.  Hundreds of\nfagots, and divers lots of timber, had been set down to him, when all\nhe had required had been a few bundles of spray for his odd man Robert\nCreedle's use in baking and lighting fires.\n\nBusiness being over, he turned to speak to the timber merchant. But\nMelbury's manner was short and distant; and Grace, too, looked vexed\nand reproachful.  Winterborne then discovered that he had been\nunwittingly bidding against her father, and picking up his favorite\nlots in spite of him.  With a very few words they left the spot and\npursued their way homeward.\n\nGiles was extremely sorry at what he had done, and remained standing\nunder the trees, all the other men having strayed silently away.  He\nsaw Melbury and his daughter pass down a glade without looking back.\nWhile they moved slowly through it a lady appeared on horseback in the\nmiddle distance, the line of her progress converging upon that of\nMelbury's.  They met, Melbury took off his hat, and she reined in her\nhorse.  A conversation was evidently in progress between Grace and her\nfather and this equestrian, in whom he was almost sure that he\nrecognized Mrs. Charmond, less by her outline than by the livery of the\ngroom who had halted some yards off.\n\nThe interlocutors did not part till after a prolonged pause, during\nwhich much seemed to be said.  When Melbury and Grace resumed their\nwalk it was with something of a lighter tread than before.\n\nWinterborne then pursued his own course homeward.  He was unwilling to\nlet coldness grow up between himself and the Melburys for any trivial\nreason, and in the evening he went to their house. On drawing near the\ngate his attention was attracted by the sight of one of the bedrooms\nblinking into a state of illumination.  In it stood Grace lighting\nseveral candles, her right hand elevating the taper, her left hand on\nher bosom, her face thoughtfully fixed on each wick as it kindled, as\nif she saw in every flame's growth the rise of a life to maturity.  He\nwondered what such unusual brilliancy could mean to-night.  On getting\nin-doors he found her father and step-mother in a state of suppressed\nexcitement, which at first he could not comprehend.\n\n\"I am sorry about my biddings to-day,\" said Giles.  \"I don't know what\nI was doing.  I have come to say that any of the lots you may require\nare yours.\"\n\n\"Oh, never mind--never mind,\" replied the timber-merchant, with a\nslight wave of his hand, \"I have so much else to think of that I nearly\nhad forgot it.  Just now, too, there are matters of a different kind\nfrom trade to attend to, so don't let it concern ye.\"\n\nAs the timber-merchant spoke, as it were, down to him from a higher\nmoral plane than his own, Giles turned to Mrs. Melbury.\n\n\"Grace is going to the House to-morrow,\" she said, quietly.  \"She is\nlooking out her things now.  I dare say she is wanting me this minute\nto assist her.\" Thereupon Mrs. Melbury left the room.\n\nNothing is more remarkable than the independent personality of the\ntongue now and then.  Mr. Melbury knew that his words had been a sort\nof boast.  He decried boasting, particularly to Giles; yet whenever the\nsubject was Grace, his judgment resigned the ministry of speech in\nspite of him.\n\nWinterborne felt surprise, pleasure, and also a little apprehension at\nthe news.  He repeated Mrs. Melbury's words.\n\n\"Yes,\" said paternal pride, not sorry to have dragged out of him what\nhe could not in any circumstances have kept in.  \"Coming home from the\nwoods this afternoon we met Mrs. Charmond out for a ride. She spoke to\nme on a little matter of business, and then got acquainted with Grace.\n'Twas wonderful how she took to Grace in a few minutes; that\nfreemasonry of education made 'em close at once. Naturally enough she\nwas amazed that such an article--ha, ha!--could come out of my house.\nAt last it led on to Mis'ess Grace being asked to the House.  So she's\nbusy hunting up her frills and furbelows to go in.\"  As Giles remained\nin thought without responding, Melbury continued: \"But I'll call her\ndown-stairs.\"\n\n\"No, no; don't do that, since she's busy,\" said Winterborne.\n\nMelbury, feeling from the young man's manner that his own talk had been\ntoo much at Giles and too little to him, repented at once. His face\nchanged, and he said, in lower tones, with an effort, \"She's yours,\nGiles, as far as I am concerned.\"\n\n\"Thanks--my best thanks....But I think, since it is all right between\nus about the biddings, that I'll not interrupt her now. I'll step\nhomeward, and call another time.\"\n\nOn leaving the house he looked up at the bedroom again.  Grace,\nsurrounded by a sufficient number of candles to answer all purposes of\nself-criticism, was standing before a cheval-glass that her father had\nlately bought expressly for her use; she was bonneted, cloaked, and\ngloved, and glanced over her shoulder into the mirror, estimating her\naspect.  Her face was lit with the natural elation of a young girl\nhoping to inaugurate on the morrow an intimate acquaintance with a new,\ninteresting, and powerful friend.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nThe inspiriting appointment which had led Grace Melbury to indulge in a\nsix-candle illumination for the arrangement of her attire, carried her\nover the ground the next morning with a springy tread. Her sense of\nbeing properly appreciated on her own native soil seemed to brighten\nthe atmosphere and herbage around her, as the glowworm's lamp\nirradiates the grass.  Thus she moved along, a vessel of emotion going\nto empty itself on she knew not what.\n\nTwenty minutes' walking through copses, over a stile, and along an\nupland lawn brought her to the verge of a deep glen, at the bottom of\nwhich Hintock House appeared immediately beneath her eye.  To describe\nit as standing in a hollow would not express the situation of the\nmanor-house; it stood in a hole, notwithstanding that the hole was full\nof beauty.  From the spot which Grace had reached a stone could easily\nhave been thrown over or into, the birds'-nested chimneys of the\nmansion.  Its walls were surmounted by a battlemented parapet; but the\ngray lead roofs were quite visible behind it, with their gutters, laps,\nrolls, and skylights, together with incised letterings and\nshoe-patterns cut by idlers thereon.\n\nThe front of the house exhibited an ordinary manorial presentation of\nElizabethan windows, mullioned and hooded, worked in rich snuff-colored\nfreestone from local quarries.  The ashlar of the walls, where not\novergrown with ivy and other creepers, was coated with lichen of every\nshade, intensifying its luxuriance with its nearness to the ground,\ntill, below the plinth, it merged in moss.\n\nAbove the house to the back was a dense plantation, the roots of whose\ntrees were above the level of the chimneys.  The corresponding high\nground on which Grace stood was richly grassed, with only an old tree\nhere and there.  A few sheep lay about, which, as they ruminated,\nlooked quietly into the bedroom windows. The situation of the house,\nprejudicial to humanity, was a stimulus to vegetation, on which account\nan endless shearing of the heavy-armed ivy was necessary, and a\ncontinual lopping of trees and shrubs.  It was an edifice built in\ntimes when human constitutions were damp-proof, when shelter from the\nboisterous was all that men thought of in choosing a dwelling-place,\nthe insidious being beneath their notice; and its hollow site was an\nocular reminder, by its unfitness for modern lives, of the fragility to\nwhich these have declined.  The highest architectural cunning could\nhave done nothing to make Hintock House dry and salubrious; and\nruthless ignorance could have done little to make it unpicturesque.  It\nwas vegetable nature's own home; a spot to inspire the painter and poet\nof still life--if they did not suffer too much from the relaxing\natmosphere--and to draw groans from the gregariously disposed.  Grace\ndescended the green escarpment by a zigzag path into the drive, which\nswept round beneath the slope. The exterior of the house had been\nfamiliar to her from her childhood, but she had never been inside, and\nthe approach to knowing an old thing in a new way was a lively\nexperience.  It was with a little flutter that she was shown in; but\nshe recollected that Mrs. Charmond would probably be alone.  Up to a\nfew days before this time that lady had been accompanied in her\ncomings, stayings, and goings by a relative believed to be her aunt;\nlatterly, however, these two ladies had separated, owing, it was\nsupposed, to a quarrel, and Mrs. Charmond had been left desolate. Being\npresumably a woman who did not care for solitude, this deprivation\nmight possibly account for her sudden interest in Grace.\n\nMrs. Charmond was at the end of a gallery opening from the hall when\nMiss Melbury was announced, and saw her through the glass doors between\nthem.  She came forward with a smile on her face, and told the young\ngirl it was good of her to come.\n\n\"Ah! you have noticed those,\" she said, seeing that Grace's eyes were\nattracted by some curious objects against the walls.  \"They are\nman-traps.  My husband was a connoisseur in man-traps and spring-guns\nand such articles, collecting them from all his neighbors.  He knew the\nhistories of all these--which gin had broken a man's leg, which gun had\nkilled a man.  That one, I remember his saying, had been set by a\ngame-keeper in the track of a notorious poacher; but the keeper,\nforgetting what he had done, went that way himself, received the charge\nin the lower part of his body, and died of the wound.  I don't like\nthem here, but I've never yet given directions for them to be taken\naway.\" She added, playfully, \"Man-traps are of rather ominous\nsignificance where a person of our sex lives, are they not?\"\n\nGrace was bound to smile; but that side of womanliness was one which\nher inexperience had no great zest in contemplating.\n\n\"They are interesting, no doubt, as relics of a barbarous time happily\npast,\" she said, looking thoughtfully at the varied designs of these\ninstruments of torture--some with semi-circular jaws, some with\nrectangular; most of them with long, sharp teeth, but a few with none,\nso that their jaws looked like the blank gums of old age.\n\n\"Well, we must not take them too seriously,\" said Mrs. Charmond, with\nan indolent turn of her head, and they moved on inward.  When she had\nshown her visitor different articles in cabinets that she deemed likely\nto interest her, some tapestries, wood-carvings, ivories, miniatures,\nand so on--always with a mien of listlessness which might either have\nbeen constitutional, or partly owing to the situation of the\nplace--they sat down to an early cup of tea.\n\n\"Will you pour it out, please? Do,\" she said, leaning back in her\nchair, and placing her hand above her forehead, while her almond\neyes--those long eyes so common to the angelic legions of early Italian\nart--became longer, and her voice more languishing.  She showed that\noblique-mannered softness which is perhaps most frequent in women of\ndarker complexion and more lymphatic temperament than Mrs. Charmond's\nwas; who lingeringly smile their meanings to men rather than speak\nthem, who inveigle rather than prompt, and take advantage of currents\nrather than steer.\n\n\"I am the most inactive woman when I am here,\" she said.  \"I think\nsometimes I was born to live and do nothing, nothing, nothing but float\nabout, as we fancy we do sometimes in dreams.  But that cannot be\nreally my destiny, and I must struggle against such fancies.\"\n\n\"I am so sorry you do not enjoy exertion--it is quite sad! I wish I\ncould tend you and make you very happy.\"\n\nThere was something so sympathetic, so appreciative, in the sound of\nGrace's voice, that it impelled people to play havoc with their\ncustomary reservations in talking to her.  \"It is tender and kind of\nyou to feel that,\" said Mrs. Charmond.  \"Perhaps I have given you the\nnotion that my languor is more than it really is.  But this place\noppresses me, and I have a plan of going abroad a good deal.  I used to\ngo with a relative, but that arrangement has dropped through.\"\nRegarding Grace with a final glance of criticism, she seemed to make up\nher mind to consider the young girl satisfactory, and continued: \"Now I\nam often impelled to record my impressions of times and places.  I have\noften thought of writing a 'New Sentimental Journey.'  But I cannot\nfind energy enough to do it alone.  When I am at different places in\nthe south of Europe I feel a crowd of ideas and fancies thronging upon\nme continually, but to unfold writing-materials, take up a cold steel\npen, and put these impressions down systematically on cold, smooth\npaper--that I cannot do.  So I have thought that if I always could have\nsomebody at my elbow with whom I am in sympathy, I might dictate any\nideas that come into my head.  And directly I had made your\nacquaintance the other day it struck me that you would suit me so well.\nWould you like to undertake it?  You might read to me, too, if\ndesirable.  Will you think it over, and ask your parents if they are\nwilling?\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" said Grace.  \"I am almost sure they would be very glad.\"\n\n\"You are so accomplished, I hear; I should be quite honored by such\nintellectual company.\"\n\nGrace, modestly blushing, deprecated any such idea.\n\n\"Do you keep up your lucubrations at Little Hintock?\"\n\n\"Oh no.  Lucubrations are not unknown at Little Hintock; but they are\nnot carried on by me.\"\n\n\"What--another student in that retreat?\"\n\n\"There is a surgeon lately come, and I have heard that he reads a great\ndeal--I see his light sometimes through the trees late at night.\"\n\n\"Oh yes--a doctor--I believe I was told of him.  It is a strange place\nfor him to settle in.\"\n\n\"It is a convenient centre for a practice, they say.  But he does not\nconfine his studies to medicine, it seems.  He investigates theology\nand metaphysics and all sorts of subjects.\"\n\n\"What is his name?\"\n\n\"Fitzpiers.  He represents a very old family, I believe, the\nFitzpierses of Buckbury-Fitzpiers--not a great many miles from here.\"\n\n\"I am not sufficiently local to know the history of the family.  I was\nnever in the county till my husband brought me here.\" Mrs. Charmond did\nnot care to pursue this line of investigation. Whatever mysterious\nmerit might attach to family antiquity, it was one which, though she\nherself could claim it, her adaptable, wandering weltburgerliche nature\nhad grown tired of caring about--a peculiarity that made her a contrast\nto her neighbors.  \"It is of rather more importance to know what the\nman is himself than what his family is,\" she said, \"if he is going to\npractise upon us as a surgeon.  Have you seen him?\"\n\nGrace had not.  \"I think he is not a very old man,\" she added.\n\n\"Has he a wife?\"\n\n\"I am not aware that he has.\"\n\n\"Well, I hope he will be useful here.  I must get to know him when I\ncome back.  It will be very convenient to have a medical man--if he is\nclever--in one's own parish.  I get dreadfully nervous sometimes,\nliving in such an outlandish place; and Sherton is so far to send to.\nNo doubt you feel Hintock to be a great change after watering-place\nlife.\"\n\n\"I do.  But it is home.  It has its advantages and its disadvantages.\"\nGrace was thinking less of the solitude than of the attendant\ncircumstances.\n\nThey chatted on for some time, Grace being set quite at her ease by her\nentertainer.  Mrs. Charmond was far too well-practised a woman not to\nknow that to show a marked patronage to a sensitive young girl who\nwould probably be very quick to discern it, was to demolish her dignity\nrather than to establish it in that young girl's eyes.  So, being\nviolently possessed with her idea of making use of this gentle\nacquaintance, ready and waiting at her own door, she took great pains\nto win her confidence at starting.\n\nJust before Grace's departure the two chanced to pause before a mirror\nwhich reflected their faces in immediate juxtaposition, so as to bring\ninto prominence their resemblances and their contrasts.  Both looked\nattractive as glassed back by the faithful reflector; but Grace's\ncountenance had the effect of making Mrs. Charmond appear more than her\nfull age.  There are complexions which set off each other to great\nadvantage, and there are those which antagonize, the one killing or\ndamaging its neighbor unmercifully.  This was unhappily the case here.\nMrs. Charmond fell into a meditation, and replied abstractedly to a\ncursory remark of her companion's.  However, she parted from her young\nfriend in the kindliest tones, promising to send and let her know as\nsoon as her mind was made up on the arrangement she had suggested.\n\nWhen Grace had ascended nearly to the top of the adjoining slope she\nlooked back, and saw that Mrs. Charmond still stood at the door,\nmeditatively regarding her.\n\n\nOften during the previous night, after his call on the Melburys,\nWinterborne's thoughts ran upon Grace's announced visit to Hintock\nHouse.  Why could he not have proposed to walk with her part of the\nway? Something told him that she might not, on such an occasion, care\nfor his company.\n\nHe was still more of that opinion when, standing in his garden next\nday, he saw her go past on the journey with such a pretty pride in the\nevent.  He wondered if her father's ambition, which had purchased for\nher the means of intellectual light and culture far beyond those of any\nother native of the village, would conduce to the flight of her future\ninterests above and away from the local life which was once to her the\nmovement of the world.\n\nNevertheless, he had her father's permission to win her if he could;\nand to this end it became desirable to bring matters soon to a crisis,\nif he ever hoped to do so.  If she should think herself too good for\nhim, he could let her go and make the best of his loss; but until he\nhad really tested her he could not say that she despised his suit.  The\nquestion was how to quicken events towards an issue.\n\nHe thought and thought, and at last decided that as good a way as any\nwould be to give a Christmas party, and ask Grace and her parents to\ncome as chief guests.\n\nThese ruminations were occupying him when there became audible a slight\nknocking at his front door.  He descended the path and looked out, and\nbeheld Marty South, dressed for out-door work.\n\n\"Why didn't you come, Mr. Winterborne?\" she said.  \"I've been waiting\nthere hours and hours, and at last I thought I must try to find you.\"\n\n\"Bless my soul, I'd quite forgot,\" said Giles.\n\nWhat he had forgotten was that there was a thousand young fir-trees to\nbe planted in a neighboring spot which had been cleared by the\nwood-cutters, and that he had arranged to plant them with his own\nhands.  He had a marvellous power of making trees grow. Although he\nwould seem to shovel in the earth quite carelessly, there was a sort of\nsympathy between himself and the fir, oak, or beech that he was\noperating on, so that the roots took hold of the soil in a few days.\nWhen, on the other hand, any of the journeymen planted, although they\nseemed to go through an identically similar process, one quarter of the\ntrees would die away during the ensuing August.\n\nHence Winterborne found delight in the work even when, as at present,\nhe contracted to do it on portions of the woodland in which he had no\npersonal interest.  Marty, who turned her hand to anything, was usually\nthe one who performed the part of keeping the trees in a perpendicular\nposition while he threw in the mould.\n\nHe accompanied her towards the spot, being stimulated yet further to\nproceed with the work by the knowledge that the ground was close to the\nway-side along which Grace must pass on her return from Hintock House.\n\n\"You've a cold in the head, Marty,\" he said, as they walked. \"That\ncomes of cutting off your hair.\"\n\n\"I suppose it do.  Yes; I've three headaches going on in my head at the\nsame time.\"\n\n\"Three headaches!\"\n\n\"Yes, a rheumatic headache in my poll, a sick headache over my eyes,\nand a misery headache in the middle of my brain.  However, I came out,\nfor I thought you might be waiting and grumbling like anything if I was\nnot there.\"\n\nThe holes were already dug, and they set to work.  Winterborne's\nfingers were endowed with a gentle conjuror's touch in spreading the\nroots of each little tree, resulting in a sort of caress, under which\nthe delicate fibres all laid themselves out in their proper directions\nfor growth.  He put most of these roots towards the south-west; for, he\nsaid, in forty years' time, when some great gale is blowing from that\nquarter, the trees will require the strongest holdfast on that side to\nstand against it and not fall.\n\n\"How they sigh directly we put 'em upright, though while they are lying\ndown they don't sigh at all,\" said Marty.\n\n\"Do they?\" said Giles.  \"I've never noticed it.\"\n\nShe erected one of the young pines into its hole, and held up her\nfinger; the soft musical breathing instantly set in, which was not to\ncease night or day till the grown tree should be felled--probably long\nafter the two planters should be felled themselves.\n\n\"It seems to me,\" the girl continued, \"as if they sigh because they are\nvery sorry to begin life in earnest--just as we be.\"\n\n\"Just as we be?\" He looked critically at her.  \"You ought not to feel\nlike that, Marty.\"\n\nHer only reply was turning to take up the next tree; and they planted\non through a great part of the day, almost without another word.\nWinterborne's mind ran on his contemplated evening-party, his\nabstraction being such that he hardly was conscious of Marty's presence\nbeside him.  From the nature of their employment, in which he handled\nthe spade and she merely held the tree, it followed that he got good\nexercise and she got none.  But she was an heroic girl, and though her\nout-stretched hand was chill as a stone, and her cheeks blue, and her\ncold worse than ever, she would not complain while he was disposed to\ncontinue work.  But when he paused she said, \"Mr. Winterborne, can I\nrun down the lane and back to warm my feet?\"\n\n\"Why, yes, of course,\" he said, awakening anew to her existence.\n\"Though I was just thinking what a mild day it is for the season. Now I\nwarrant that cold of yours is twice as bad as it was.  You had no\nbusiness to chop that hair off, Marty; it serves you almost right.\nLook here, cut off home at once.\"\n\n\"A run down the lane will be quite enough.\"\n\n\"No, it won't.  You ought not to have come out to-day at all.\"\n\n\"But I should like to finish the--\"\n\n\"Marty, I tell you to go home,\" said he, peremptorily.  \"I can manage\nto keep the rest of them upright with a stick or something.\"\n\nShe went away without saying any more.  When she had gone down the\norchard a little distance she looked back.  Giles suddenly went after\nher.\n\n\"Marty, it was for your good that I was rough, you know.  But warm\nyourself in your own way, I don't care.\"\n\nWhen she had run off he fancied he discerned a woman's dress through\nthe holly-bushes which divided the coppice from the road. It was Grace\nat last, on her way back from the interview with Mrs. Charmond.  He\nthrew down the tree he was planting, and was about to break through the\nbelt of holly when he suddenly became aware of the presence of another\nman, who was looking over the hedge on the opposite side of the way\nupon the figure of the unconscious Grace.  He appeared as a handsome\nand gentlemanly personage of six or eight and twenty, and was quizzing\nher through an eye-glass. Seeing that Winterborne was noticing him, he\nlet his glass drop with a click upon the rail which protected the\nhedge, and walked away in the opposite direction.  Giles knew in a\nmoment that this must be Mr. Fitzpiers.  When he was gone, Winterborne\npushed through the hollies, and emerged close beside the interesting\nobject of their contemplation.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\n\"I heard the bushes move long before I saw you,\" she began.  \"I said\nfirst, 'it is some terrible beast;' next, 'it is a poacher;' next, 'it\nis a friend!'\"\n\nHe regarded her with a slight smile, weighing, not her speech, but the\nquestion whether he should tell her that she had been watched. He\ndecided in the negative.\n\n\"You have been to the house?\" he said.  \"But I need not ask.\" The fact\nwas that there shone upon Miss Melbury's face a species of exaltation,\nwhich saw no environing details nor his own occupation; nothing more\nthan his bare presence.\n\n\"Why need you not ask?\"\n\n\"Your face is like the face of Moses when he came down from the Mount.\"\n\nShe reddened a little and said, \"How can you be so profane, Giles\nWinterborne?\"\n\n\"How can you think so much of that class of people? Well, I beg pardon;\nI didn't mean to speak so freely.  How do you like her house and her?\"\n\n\"Exceedingly.  I had not been inside the walls since I was a child,\nwhen it used to be let to strangers, before Mrs. Charmond's late\nhusband bought the property.  She is SO nice!\" And Grace fell into such\nan abstracted gaze at the imaginary image of Mrs. Charmond and her\nniceness that it almost conjured up a vision of that lady in mid-air\nbefore them.\n\n\"She has only been here a month or two, it seems, and cannot stay much\nlonger, because she finds it so lonely and damp in winter. She is going\nabroad.  Only think, she would like me to go with her.\"\n\nGiles's features stiffened a little at the news.  \"Indeed; what for?\nBut I won't keep you standing here.  Hoi, Robert!\" he cried to a\nswaying collection of clothes in the distance, which was the figure of\nCreedle his man.  \"Go on filling in there till I come back.\"\n\n\"I'm a-coming, sir; I'm a-coming.\"\n\n\"Well, the reason is this,\" continued she, as they went on\ntogether--\"Mrs. Charmond has a delightful side to her character--a\ndesire to record her impressions of travel, like Alexandre Dumas, and\nMery, and Sterne,  and others.  But she cannot find energy enough to do\nit herself.\" And Grace proceeded to explain Mrs. Charmond's proposal at\nlarge.  \"My notion is that Mery's style will suit her best, because he\nwrites in that soft, emotional, luxurious way she has,\" Grace said,\nmusingly.\n\n\"Indeed!\" said Winterborne, with mock awe.  \"Suppose you talk over my\nhead a little longer, Miss Grace Melbury?\"\n\n\"Oh, I didn't mean it!\" she said, repentantly, looking into his eyes.\n\"And as for myself, I hate French books.  And I love dear old Hintock,\nAND THE PEOPLE IN IT, fifty times better than all the Continent.  But\nthe scheme; I think it an enchanting notion, don't you, Giles?\"\n\n\"It is well enough in one sense, but it will take you away,\" said he,\nmollified.\n\n\"Only for a short time.  We should return in May.\"\n\n\"Well, Miss Melbury, it is a question for your father.\"\n\nWinterborne walked with her nearly to her house.  He had awaited her\ncoming, mainly with the view of mentioning to her his proposal to have\na Christmas party; but homely Christmas gatherings in the venerable and\njovial Hintock style seemed so primitive and uncouth beside the lofty\nmatters of her converse and thought that he refrained.\n\nAs soon as she was gone he turned back towards the scene of his\nplanting, and could not help saying to himself as he walked, that this\nengagement of his was a very unpromising business.  Her outing to-day\nhad not improved it.  A woman who could go to Hintock House and be\nfriendly with its mistress, enter into the views of its mistress, talk\nlike her, and dress not much unlike her, why, she would hardly be\ncontented with him, a yeoman, now immersed in tree-planting, even\nthough he planted them well.  \"And yet she's a true-hearted girl,\" he\nsaid, thinking of her words about Hintock.  \"I must bring matters to a\npoint, and there's an end of it.\"\n\nWhen he reached the plantation he found that Marty had come back, and\ndismissing Creedle, he went on planting silently with the girl as\nbefore.\n\n\"Suppose, Marty,\" he said, after a while, looking at her extended arm,\nupon which old scratches from briers showed themselves purple in the\ncold wind--\"suppose you know a person, and want to bring that person to\na good understanding with you, do you think a Christmas party of some\nsort is a warming-up thing, and likely to be useful in hastening on the\nmatter?\"\n\n\"Is there to be dancing?\"\n\n\"There might be, certainly.\"\n\n\"Will He dance with She?\"\n\n\"Well, yes.\"\n\n\"Then it might bring things to a head, one way or the other; I won't be\nthe one to say which.\"\n\n\"It shall be done,\" said Winterborne, not to her, though he spoke the\nwords quite loudly.  And as the day was nearly ended, he added, \"Here,\nMarty, I'll send up a man to plant the rest to-morrow.  I've other\nthings to think of just now.\"\n\nShe did not inquire what other things, for she had seen him walking\nwith Grace Melbury.  She looked towards the western sky, which was now\naglow like some vast foundery wherein new worlds were being cast.\nAcross it the bare bough of a tree stretched horizontally, revealing\nevery twig against the red, and showing in dark profile every beck and\nmovement of three pheasants that were settling themselves down on it in\na row to roost.\n\n\"It will be fine to-morrow,\" said Marty, observing them with the\nvermilion light of the sun in the pupils of her eyes, \"for they are\na-croupied down nearly at the end of the bough.  If it were going to be\nstormy they'd squeeze close to the trunk.  The weather is almost all\nthey have to think of, isn't it, Mr. Winterborne? and so they must be\nlighter-hearted than we.\"\n\n\"I dare say they are,\" said Winterborne.\n\n\nBefore taking a single step in the preparations, Winterborne, with no\ngreat hopes, went across that evening to the timber-merchant's to\nascertain if Grace and her parents would honor him with their presence.\nHaving first to set his nightly gins in the garden, to catch the\nrabbits that ate his winter-greens, his call was delayed till just\nafter the rising of the moon, whose rays reached the Hintock houses but\nfitfully as yet, on account of the trees. Melbury was crossing his yard\non his way to call on some one at the larger village, but he readily\nturned and walked up and down the path with the young man.\n\nGiles, in his self-deprecatory sense of living on a much smaller scale\nthan the Melburys did, would not for the world imply that his\ninvitation was to a gathering of any importance.  So he put it in the\nmild form of \"Can you come in for an hour, when you have done business,\nthe day after to-morrow; and Mrs. and Miss Melbury, if they have\nnothing more pressing to do?\"\n\nMelbury would give no answer at once.  \"No, I can't tell you to-day,\"\nhe said.  \"I must talk it over with the women.  As far as I am\nconcerned, my dear Giles, you know I'll come with pleasure. But how do\nI know what Grace's notions may be?  You see, she has been away among\ncultivated folks a good while; and now this acquaintance with Mrs.\nCharmond--Well, I'll ask her.  I can say no more.\"\n\nWhen Winterborne was gone the timber-merchant went on his way.  He knew\nvery well that Grace, whatever her own feelings, would either go or not\ngo, according as he suggested; and his instinct was, for the moment, to\nsuggest the negative.  His errand took him past the church, and the way\nto his destination was either across the church-yard or along-side it,\nthe distances being the same.  For some reason or other he chose the\nformer way.\n\nThe moon was faintly lighting up the gravestones, and the path, and the\nfront of the building.  Suddenly Mr. Melbury paused, turned ill upon\nthe grass, and approached a particular headstone, where he read, \"In\nmemory of John Winterborne,\" with the subjoined date and age.  It was\nthe grave of Giles's father.\n\nThe timber-merchant laid his hand upon the stone, and was humanized.\n\"Jack, my wronged friend!\" he said.  \"I'll be faithful to my plan of\nmaking amends to 'ee.\"\n\nWhen he reached home that evening, he said to Grace and Mrs. Melbury,\nwho were working at a little table by the fire,\n\n\"Giles wants us to go down and spend an hour with him the day after\nto-morrow; and I'm thinking, that as 'tis Giles who asks us, we'll go.\"\n\nThey assented without demur, and accordingly the timber-merchant sent\nGiles the next morning an answer in the affirmative.\n\n\n\nWinterborne, in his modesty, or indifference, had mentioned no\nparticular hour in his invitation; and accordingly Mr. Melbury and his\nfamily, expecting no other guests, chose their own time, which chanced\nto be rather early in the afternoon, by reason of the somewhat quicker\ndespatch than usual of the timber-merchant's business that day.  To\nshow their sense of the unimportance of the occasion, they walked quite\nslowly to the house, as if they were merely out for a ramble, and going\nto nothing special at all; or at most intending to pay a casual call\nand take a cup of tea.\n\nAt this hour stir and bustle pervaded the interior of Winterborne's\ndomicile from cellar to apple-loft.  He had planned an elaborate high\ntea for six o'clock or thereabouts, and a good roaring supper to come\non about eleven.  Being a bachelor of rather retiring habits, the whole\nof the preparations devolved upon himself and his trusty man and\nfamiliar, Robert Creedle, who did everything that required doing, from\nmaking Giles's bed to catching moles in his field.  He was a survival\nfrom the days when Giles's father held the homestead, and Giles was a\nplaying boy.\n\nThese two, with a certain dilatoriousness which appertained to both,\nwere now in the heat of preparation in the bake-house, expecting nobody\nbefore six o'clock.  Winterborne was standing before the brick oven in\nhis shirt-sleeves, tossing in thorn sprays, and stirring about the\nblazing mass with a long-handled, three-pronged Beelzebub kind of fork,\nthe heat shining out upon his streaming face and making his eyes like\nfurnaces, the thorns crackling and sputtering; while Creedle, having\nranged the pastry dishes in a row on the table till the oven should be\nready, was pressing out the crust of a final apple-pie with a\nrolling-pin.  A great pot boiled on the fire, and through the open door\nof the back kitchen a boy was seen seated on the fender, emptying the\nsnuffers and scouring the candlesticks, a row of the latter standing\nupside down on the hob to melt out the grease.\n\nLooking up from the rolling-pin, Creedle saw passing the window first\nthe timber-merchant, in his second-best suit, Mrs. Melbury in her best\nsilk, and Grace in the fashionable attire which, in part brought home\nwith her from the Continent, she had worn on her visit to Mrs.\nCharmond's.  The eyes of the three had been attracted to the\nproceedings within by the fierce illumination which the oven threw out\nupon the operators and their utensils.\n\n\"Lord, Lord! if they baint come a'ready!\" said Creedle.\n\n\"No--hey?\" said Giles, looking round aghast; while the boy in the\nbackground waved a reeking candlestick in his delight.  As there was no\nhelp for it, Winterborne went to meet them in the door-way.\n\n\"My dear Giles, I see we have made a mistake in the time,\" said the\ntimber-merchant's wife, her face lengthening with concern.\n\n\"Oh, it is not much difference.  I hope you'll come in.\"\n\n\"But this means a regular randyvoo!\" said Mr. Melbury, accusingly,\nglancing round and pointing towards the bake-house with his stick.\n\n\"Well, yes,\" said Giles.\n\n\"And--not Great Hintock band, and dancing, surely?\"\n\n\"I told three of 'em they might drop in if they'd nothing else to do,\"\nGiles mildly admitted.\n\n\"Now, why the name didn't ye tell us 'twas going to be a serious kind\nof thing before? How should I know what folk mean if they don't say?\nNow, shall we come in, or shall we go home and come back along in a\ncouple of hours?\"\n\n\"I hope you'll stay, if you'll be so good as not to mind, now you are\nhere.  I shall have it all right and tidy in a very little time.  I\nought not to have been so backward.\" Giles spoke quite anxiously for\none of his undemonstrative temperament; for he feared that if the\nMelburys once were back in their own house they would not be disposed\nto turn out again.\n\n\"'Tis we ought not to have been so forward; that's what 'tis,\" said Mr.\nMelbury, testily.  \"Don't keep us here in the sitting-room; lead on to\nthe bakehouse, man.  Now we are here we'll help ye get ready for the\nrest.  Here, mis'ess, take off your things, and help him out in his\nbaking, or he won't get done to-night. I'll finish heating the oven,\nand set you free to go and skiver up them ducks.\" His eye had passed\nwith pitiless directness of criticism into yet remote recesses of\nWinterborne's awkwardly built premises, where the aforesaid birds were\nhanging.\n\n\"And I'll help finish the tarts,\" said Grace, cheerfully.\n\n\"I don't know about that,\" said her father.  \"'Tisn't quite so much in\nyour line as it is in your mother-law's and mine.\"\n\n\"Of course I couldn't let you, Grace!\" said Giles, with some distress.\n\n\"I'll do it, of course,\" said Mrs. Melbury, taking off her silk train,\nhanging it up to a nail, carefully rolling back her sleeves, pinning\nthem to her shoulders, and stripping Giles of his apron for her own use.\n\nSo Grace pottered idly about, while her father and his wife helped on\nthe preparations.  A kindly pity of his household management, which\nWinterborne saw in her eyes whenever he caught them, depressed him much\nmore than her contempt would have done.\n\nCreedle met Giles at the pump after a while, when each of the others\nwas absorbed in the difficulties of a cuisine based on utensils,\ncupboards, and provisions that were strange to them.  He groaned to the\nyoung man in a whisper, \"This is a bruckle het, maister, I'm much\nafeared!  Who'd ha' thought they'd ha' come so soon?\"\n\nThe bitter placidity of Winterborne's look adumbrated the misgivings he\ndid not care to express.  \"Have you got the celery ready?\" he asked,\nquickly.\n\n\"Now that's a thing I never could mind; no, not if you'd paid me in\nsilver and gold.  And I don't care who the man is, I says that a stick\nof celery that isn't scrubbed with the scrubbing-brush is not clean.\"\n\n\"Very well, very well!  I'll attend to it.  You go and get 'em\ncomfortable in-doors.\"\n\nHe hastened to the garden, and soon returned, tossing the stalks to\nCreedle, who was still in a tragic mood.  \"If ye'd ha' married, d'ye\nsee, maister,\" he said, \"this caddle couldn't have happened to us.\"\n\nEverything being at last under way, the oven set, and all done that\ncould insure the supper turning up ready at some time or other, Giles\nand his friends entered the parlor, where the Melburys again dropped\ninto position as guests, though the room was not nearly so warm and\ncheerful as the blazing bakehouse. Others now arrived, among them\nFarmer Bawtree and the hollow-turner, and tea went off very well.\n\nGrace's disposition to make the best of everything, and to wink at\ndeficiencies in Winterborne's menage, was so uniform and persistent\nthat he suspected her of seeing even more deficiencies than he was\naware of.  That suppressed sympathy which had showed in her face ever\nsince her arrival told him as much too plainly.\n\n\"This muddling style of house-keeping is what you've not lately been\nused to, I suppose?\" he said, when they were a little apart.\n\n\"No; but I like it; it reminds me so pleasantly that everything here in\ndear old Hintock is just as it used to be.  The oil is--not quite nice;\nbut everything else is.\"\n\n\"The oil?\"\n\n\"On the chairs, I mean; because it gets on one's dress.  Still, mine is\nnot a new one.\"\n\nGiles found that Creedle, in his zeal to make things look bright, had\nsmeared the chairs with some greasy kind of furniture-polish, and\nrefrained from rubbing it dry in order not to diminish the mirror-like\neffect that the mixture produced as laid on.  Giles apologized and\ncalled Creedle; but he felt that the Fates were against him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nSupper-time came, and with it the hot-baked meats from the oven, laid on a\nsnowy cloth fresh from the press, and reticulated with folds, as in\nFlemish \"Last Suppers.\"  Creedle and the boy fetched and carried with\namazing alacrity, the latter, to mollify his superior and make things\npleasant, expressing his admiration of Creedle's cleverness when they\nwere alone.\n\n\"I s'pose the time when you learned all these knowing things, Mr.\nCreedle, was when you was in the militia?\"\n\n\"Well, yes.  I seed the world at that time somewhat, certainly, and\nmany ways of strange dashing life.  Not but that Giles has worked hard\nin helping me to bring things to such perfection to-day.  'Giles,' says\nI, though he's maister.  Not that I should call'n maister by rights,\nfor his father growed up side by side with me, as if one mother had\ntwinned us and been our nourishing.\"\n\n\"I s'pose your memory can reach a long way back into history, Mr.\nCreedle?\"\n\n\"Oh yes.  Ancient days, when there was battles and famines and\nhang-fairs and other pomps, seem to me as yesterday.  Ah, many's the\npatriarch I've seed come and go in this parish! There, he's calling for\nmore plates.  Lord, why can't 'em turn their plates bottom upward for\npudding, as they used to do in former days?\"\n\nMeanwhile, in the adjoining room Giles was presiding in a\nhalf-unconscious state.  He could not get over the initial failures in\nhis scheme for advancing his suit, and hence he did not know that he\nwas eating mouthfuls of bread and nothing else, and continually\nsnuffing the two candles next him till he had reduced them to mere\nglimmers drowned in their own grease.  Creedle now appeared with a\nspecially prepared dish, which he served by elevating the little\nthree-legged pot that contained it, and tilting the contents into a\ndish, exclaiming, simultaneously, \"Draw back, gentlemen and ladies,\nplease!\"\n\nA splash followed.  Grace gave a quick, involuntary nod and blink, and\nput her handkerchief to her face.\n\n\"Good heavens! what did you do that for, Creedle?\" said Giles, sternly,\nand jumping up.\n\n\"'Tis how I do it when they baint here, maister,\" mildly expostulated\nCreedle, in an aside audible to all the company.\n\n\"Well, yes--but--\" replied Giles.  He went over to Grace, and hoped\nnone of it had gone into her eye.\n\n\"Oh no,\" she said.  \"Only a sprinkle on my face.  It was nothing.\"\n\n\"Kiss it and make it well,\" gallantly observed Mr. Bawtree.\n\nMiss Melbury blushed.\n\nThe timber-merchant said, quickly, \"Oh, it is nothing! She must bear\nthese little mishaps.\" But there could be discerned in his face\nsomething which said \"I ought to have foreseen this.\"\n\nGiles himself, since the untoward beginning of the feast, had not quite\nliked to see Grace present.  He wished he had not asked such people as\nBawtree and the hollow-turner.  He had done it, in dearth of other\nfriends, that the room might not appear empty.  In his mind's eye,\nbefore the event, they had been the mere background or padding of the\nscene, but somehow in reality they were the most prominent personages\nthere.\n\nAfter supper they played cards, Bawtree and the hollow-turner\nmonopolizing the new packs for an interminable game, in which a lump of\nchalk was incessantly used--a game those two always played wherever\nthey were, taking a solitary candle and going to a private table in a\ncorner with the mien of persons bent on weighty matters.  The rest of\nthe company on this account were obliged to put up with old packs for\ntheir round game, that had been lying by in a drawer ever since the\ntime that Giles's grandmother was alive.  Each card had a great stain\nin the middle of its back, produced by the touch of generations of damp\nand excited thumbs now fleshless in the grave; and the kings and queens\nwore a decayed expression of feature, as if they were rather an\nimpecunious dethroned race of monarchs hiding in obscure slums than\nreal regal characters.  Every now and then the comparatively few\nremarks of the players at the round game were harshly intruded on by\nthe measured jingle of Farmer Bawtree and the hollow-turner from the\nback of the room:\n\n    \"And I' will hold' a wa'-ger with you'\n     That all' these marks' are thirt'-y two!\"\n\naccompanied by rapping strokes with the chalk on the table; then an\nexclamation, an argument, a dealing of the cards; then the commencement\nof the rhymes anew.\n\nThe timber-merchant showed his feelings by talking with a satisfied\nsense of weight in his words, and by praising the party in a\npatronizing tone, when Winterborne expressed his fear that he and his\nwere not enjoying themselves.\n\n\"Oh yes, yes; pretty much.  What handsome glasses those are!  I didn't\nknow you had such glasses in the house.  Now, Lucy\" (to his wife), \"you\nought to get some like them for ourselves.\" And when they had abandoned\ncards, and Winterborne was talking to Melbury by the fire, it was the\ntimber-merchant who stood with his back to the mantle in a proprietary\nattitude, from which post of vantage he critically regarded Giles's\nperson, rather as a superficies than as a solid with ideas and feelings\ninside it, saying, \"What a splendid coat that one is you have on,\nGiles! I can't get such coats.  You dress better than I.\"\n\nAfter supper there was a dance, the bandsmen from Great Hintock having\narrived some time before.  Grace had been away from home so long that\nshe had forgotten the old figures, and hence did not join in the\nmovement.  Then Giles felt that all was over.  As for her, she was\nthinking, as she watched the gyrations, of a very different measure\nthat she had been accustomed to tread with a bevy of sylph-like\ncreatures in muslin, in the music-room of a large house, most of whom\nwere now moving in scenes widely removed from this, both as regarded\nplace and character.\n\nA woman she did not know came and offered to tell her fortune with the\nabandoned cards.  Grace assented to the proposal, and the woman told\nher tale unskilfully, for want of practice, as she declared.\n\nMr. Melbury was standing by, and exclaimed, contemptuously, \"Tell her\nfortune, indeed! Her fortune has been told by men of science--what do\nyou call 'em? Phrenologists.  You can't teach her anything new.  She's\nbeen too far among the wise ones to be astonished at anything she can\nhear among us folks in Hintock.\"\n\nAt last the time came for breaking up, Melbury and his family being the\nearliest to leave, the two card-players still pursuing their game\ndoggedly in the corner, where they had completely covered Giles's\nmahogany table with chalk scratches.  The three walked home, the\ndistance being short and the night clear.\n\n\"Well, Giles is a very good fellow,\" said Mr. Melbury, as they struck\ndown the lane under boughs which formed a black filigree in which the\nstars seemed set.\n\n\"Certainly he is,\" said Grace, quickly, and in such a tone as to show\nthat he stood no lower, if no higher, in her regard than he had stood\nbefore.\n\nWhen they were opposite an opening through which, by day, the doctor's\nhouse could be seen, they observed a light in one of his rooms,\nalthough it was now about two o'clock.\n\n\"The doctor is not abed yet,\" said Mrs. Melbury.\n\n\"Hard study, no doubt,\" said her husband.\n\n\"One would think that, as he seems to have nothing to do about here by\nday, he could at least afford to go to bed early at night. 'Tis\nastonishing how little we see of him.\"\n\nMelbury's mind seemed to turn with much relief to the contemplation of\nMr. Fitzpiers after the scenes of the evening. \"It is natural enough,\"\nhe replied.  \"What can a man of that sort find to interest him in\nHintock?  I don't expect he'll stay here long.\"\n\nHis mind reverted to Giles's party, and when they were nearly home he\nspoke again, his daughter being a few steps in advance: \"It is hardly\nthe line of life for a girl like Grace, after what she's been\naccustomed to.  I didn't foresee that in sending her to boarding-school\nand letting her travel, and what not, to make her a good bargain for\nGiles, I should be really spoiling her for him. Ah, 'tis a thousand\npities! But he ought to have her--he ought!\"\n\nAt this moment the two exclusive, chalk-mark men, having at last really\nfinished their play, could be heard coming along in the rear,\nvociferously singing a song to march-time, and keeping vigorous step to\nthe same in far-reaching strides--\n\n     \"She may go, oh!\n      She may go, oh!\n      She may go to the d---- for me!\"\n\n\nThe timber-merchant turned indignantly to Mrs. Melbury.  \"That's the\nsort of society we've been asked to meet,\" he said.  \"For us old folk\nit didn't matter; but for Grace--Giles should have known better!\"\n\n\nMeanwhile, in the empty house from which the guests had just cleared\nout, the subject of their discourse was walking from room to room\nsurveying the general displacement of furniture with no ecstatic\nfeeling; rather the reverse, indeed.  At last he entered the bakehouse,\nand found there Robert Creedle sitting over the embers, also lost in\ncontemplation.  Winterborne sat down beside him.\n\n\"Well, Robert, you must be tired.  You'd better get on to bed.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay, Giles--what do I call ye? Maister, I would say.  But 'tis well\nto think the day IS done, when 'tis done.\"\n\nWinterborne had abstractedly taken the poker, and with a wrinkled\nforehead was ploughing abroad the wood-embers on the broad hearth, till\nit was like a vast scorching Sahara, with red-hot bowlders lying about\neverywhere.  \"Do you think it went off well, Creedle?\" he asked.\n\n\"The victuals did; that I know.  And the drink did; that I steadfastly\nbelieve, from the holler sound of the barrels.  Good, honest drink\n'twere, the headiest mead I ever brewed; and the best wine that berries\ncould rise to; and the briskest Horner-and-Cleeves cider ever wrung\ndown, leaving out the spice and sperrits I put into it, while that\negg-flip would ha' passed through muslin, so little curdled 'twere.\n'Twas good enough to make any king's heart merry--ay, to make his whole\ncarcass smile.  Still, I don't deny I'm afeared some things didn't go\nwell with He and his.\" Creedle nodded in a direction which signified\nwhere the Melburys lived.\n\n\"I'm afraid, too, that it was a failure there!\"\n\n\"If so, 'twere doomed to be so.  Not but what that snail might as well\nhave come upon anybody else's plate as hers.\"\n\n\"What snail?\"\n\n\"Well, maister, there was a little one upon the edge of her plate when\nI brought it out; and so it must have been in her few leaves of\nwintergreen.\"\n\n\"How the deuce did a snail get there?\"\n\n\"That I don't know no more than the dead; but there my gentleman was.\"\n\n\"But, Robert, of all places, that was where he shouldn't have been!\"\n\n\"Well, 'twas his native home, come to that; and where else could we\nexpect him to be? I don't care who the man is, snails and caterpillars\nalways will lurk in close to the stump of cabbages in that tantalizing\nway.\"\n\n\"He wasn't alive, I suppose?\" said Giles, with a shudder on Grace's\naccount.\n\n\"Oh no.  He was well boiled.  I warrant him well boiled.  God forbid\nthat a LIVE snail should be seed on any plate of victuals that's served\nby Robert Creedle....But Lord, there; I don't mind 'em myself--them\nsmall ones, for they were born on cabbage, and they've lived on\ncabbage, so they must be made of cabbage.  But she, the close-mouthed\nlittle lady, she didn't say a word about it; though 'twould have made\ngood small conversation as to the nater of such creatures; especially\nas wit ran short among us sometimes.\"\n\n\"Oh yes--'tis all over!\" murmured Giles to himself, shaking his head\nover the glooming plain of embers, and lining his forehead more than\never.  \"Do you know, Robert,\" he said, \"that she's been accustomed to\nservants and everything superfine these many years? How, then, could\nshe stand our ways?\"\n\n\"Well, all I can say is, then, that she ought to hob-and-nob elsewhere.\nThey shouldn't have schooled her so monstrous high, or else bachelor\nmen shouldn't give randys, or if they do give 'em, only to their own\nrace.\"\n\n\"Perhaps that's true,\" said Winterborne, rising and yawning a sigh.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\n\"'Tis a pity--a thousand pities!\" her father kept saying next morning\nat breakfast, Grace being still in her bedroom.\n\nBut how could he, with any self-respect, obstruct Winterborne's suit at\nthis stage, and nullify a scheme he had labored to promote--was,\nindeed, mechanically promoting at this moment?  A crisis was\napproaching, mainly as a result of his contrivances, and it would have\nto be met.\n\nBut here was the fact, which could not be disguised: since seeing what\nan immense change her last twelve months of absence had produced in his\ndaughter, after the heavy sum per annum that he had been spending for\nseveral years upon her education, he was reluctant to let her marry\nGiles Winterborne, indefinitely occupied as woodsman, cider-merchant,\napple-farmer, and what not, even were she willing to marry him herself.\n\n\"She will be his wife if you don't upset her notion that she's bound to\naccept him as an understood thing,\" said Mrs. Melbury. \"Bless ye,\nshe'll soon shake down here in Hintock, and be content with Giles's way\nof living, which he'll improve with what money she'll have from you.\n'Tis the strangeness after her genteel life that makes her feel\nuncomfortable at first.  Why, when I saw Hintock the first time I\nthought I never could like it.  But things gradually get familiar, and\nstone floors seem not so very cold and hard, and the hooting of the\nowls not so very dreadful, and loneliness not so very lonely, after a\nwhile.\"\n\n\"Yes, I believe ye.  That's just it.  I KNOW Grace will gradually sink\ndown to our level again, and catch our manners and way of speaking, and\nfeel a drowsy content in being Giles's wife.  But I can't bear the\nthought of dragging down to that old level as promising a piece of\nmaidenhood as ever lived--fit to ornament a palace wi'--that I've taken\nso much trouble to lift up.  Fancy her white hands getting redder every\nday, and her tongue losing its pretty up-country curl in talking, and\nher bounding walk becoming the regular Hintock shail and wamble!\"\n\n\"She may shail, but she'll never wamble,\" replied his wife, decisively.\n\nWhen Grace came down-stairs he complained of her lying in bed so late;\nnot so much moved by a particular objection to that form of indulgence\nas discomposed by these other reflections.\n\nThe corners of her pretty mouth dropped a little down.  \"You used to\ncomplain with justice when I was a girl,\" she said.  \"But I am a woman\nnow, and can judge for myself....But it is not that; it is something\nelse!\" Instead of sitting down she went outside the door.\n\nHe was sorry.  The petulance that relatives show towards each other is\nin truth directed against that intangible Causality which has shaped\nthe situation no less for the offenders than the offended, but is too\nelusive to be discerned and cornered by poor humanity in irritated\nmood.  Melbury followed her.  She had rambled on to the paddock, where\nthe white frost lay, and where starlings in flocks of twenties and\nthirties were walking about, watched by a comfortable family of\nsparrows perched in a line along the string-course of the chimney,\npreening themselves in the rays of the sun.\n\n\"Come in to breakfast, my girl,\" he said.  \"And as to Giles, use your\nown mind.  Whatever pleases you will please me.\"\n\n\"I am promised to him, father; and I cannot help thinking that in honor\nI ought to marry him, whenever I do marry.\"\n\nHe had a strong suspicion that somewhere in the bottom of her heart\nthere pulsed an old simple indigenous feeling favorable to Giles,\nthough it had become overlaid with implanted tastes.  But he would not\ndistinctly express his views on the promise.  \"Very well,\" he said.\n\"But I hope I sha'n't lose you yet.  Come in to breakfast.  What did\nyou think of the inside of Hintock House the other day?\"\n\n\"I liked it much.\"\n\n\"Different from friend Winterborne's?\"\n\nShe said nothing; but he who knew her was aware that she meant by her\nsilence to reproach him with drawing cruel comparisons.\n\n\"Mrs. Charmond has asked you to come again--when, did you say?\"\n\n\"She thought Tuesday, but would send the day before to let me know if\nit suited her.\" And with this subject upon their lips they entered to\nbreakfast.\n\nTuesday came, but no message from Mrs. Charmond.  Nor was there any on\nWednesday.  In brief, a fortnight slipped by without a sign, and it\nlooked suspiciously as if Mrs. Charmond were not going further in the\ndirection of \"taking up\" Grace at present.\n\nHer father reasoned thereon.  Immediately after his daughter's two\nindubitable successes with Mrs. Charmond--the interview in the wood and\na visit to the House--she had attended Winterborne's party.  No doubt\nthe out-and-out joviality of that gathering had made it a topic in the\nneighborhood, and that every one present as guests had been widely\nspoken of--Grace, with her exceptional qualities, above all.  What,\nthen, so natural as that Mrs. Charmond should have heard the village\nnews, and become quite disappointed in her expectations of Grace at\nfinding she kept such company?\n\nFull of this post hoc argument, Mr. Melbury overlooked the infinite\nthrong of other possible reasons and unreasons for a woman changing her\nmind.  For instance, while knowing that his Grace was attractive, he\nquite forgot that Mrs. Charmond had also great pretensions to beauty.\nIn his simple estimate, an attractive woman attracted all around.\n\nSo it was settled in his mind that her sudden mingling with the\nvillagers at the unlucky Winterborne's was the cause of her most\ngrievous loss, as he deemed it, in the direction of Hintock House.\n\n\"'Tis a thousand pities!\" he would repeat to himself.  \"I am ruining\nher for conscience' sake!\"\n\nIt was one morning later on, while these things were agitating his\nmind, that, curiously enough, something darkened the window just as\nthey finished breakfast.  Looking up, they saw Giles in person mounted\non horseback, and straining his neck forward, as he had been doing for\nsome time, to catch their attention through the window.  Grace had been\nthe first to see him, and involuntarily exclaimed, \"There he is--and a\nnew horse!\"\n\nOn their faces as they regarded Giles were written their suspended\nthoughts and compound feelings concerning him, could he have read them\nthrough those old panes.  But he saw nothing: his features just now\nwere, for a wonder, lit up with a red smile at some other idea.  So\nthey rose from breakfast and went to the door, Grace with an anxious,\nwistful manner, her father in a reverie, Mrs. Melbury placid and\ninquiring.  \"We have come out to look at your horse,\" she said.\n\nIt could be seen that he was pleased at their attention, and explained\nthat he had ridden a mile or two to try the animal's paces.  \"I bought\nher,\" he added, with warmth so severely repressed as to seem\nindifference, \"because she has been used to carry a lady.\"\n\nStill Mr. Melbury did not brighten.  Mrs. Melbury said, \"And is she\nquiet?\"\n\nWinterborne assured her that there was no doubt of it.  \"I took care of\nthat.  She's five-and-twenty, and very clever for her age.\"\n\n\"Well, get off and come in,\" said Melbury, brusquely; and Giles\ndismounted accordingly.\n\nThis event was the concrete result of Winterborne's thoughts during the\npast week or two.  The want of success with his evening party he had\naccepted in as philosophic a mood as he was capable of; but there had\nbeen enthusiasm enough left in him one day at Sherton Abbas market to\npurchase this old mare, which had belonged to a neighboring parson with\nseveral daughters, and was offered him to carry either a gentleman or a\nlady, and to do odd jobs of carting and agriculture at a pinch.  This\nobliging quadruped seemed to furnish Giles with a means of reinstating\nhimself in Melbury's good opinion as a man of considerateness by\nthrowing out future possibilities to Grace.\n\nThe latter looked at him with intensified interest this morning, in the\nmood which is altogether peculiar to woman's nature, and which, when\nreduced into plain words, seems as impossible as the penetrability of\nmatter--that of entertaining a tender pity for the object of her own\nunnecessary coldness.  The imperturbable poise which marked Winterborne\nin general was enlivened now by a freshness and animation that set a\nbrightness in his eye and on his cheek.  Mrs. Melbury asked him to have\nsome breakfast, and he pleasurably replied that he would join them,\nwith his usual lack of tactical observation, not perceiving that they\nhad all finished the meal, that the hour was inconveniently late, and\nthat the note piped by the kettle denoted it to be nearly empty; so\nthat fresh water had to be brought in, trouble taken to make it boil,\nand a general renovation of the table carried out.  Neither did he\nknow, so full was he of his tender ulterior object in buying that\nhorse, how many cups of tea he was gulping down one after another, nor\nhow the morning was slipping, nor how he was keeping the family from\ndispersing about their duties.\n\nThen he told throughout the humorous story of the horse's purchase,\nlooking particularly grim at some fixed object in the room, a way he\nalways looked when he narrated anything that amused him.  While he\nwas still thinking of the scene he had described, Grace rose and\nsaid, \"I have to go and help my mother now, Mr. Winterborne.\"\n\n\"H'm!\" he ejaculated, turning his eyes suddenly upon her.\n\nShe repeated her words with a slight blush of awkwardness; whereupon\nGiles, becoming suddenly conscious, too conscious, jumped up, saying,\n\"To be sure, to be sure!\" wished them quickly good-morning, and bolted\nout of the house.\n\nNevertheless he had, upon the whole, strengthened his position, with\nher at least.  Time, too, was on his side, for (as her father saw with\nsome regret) already the homeliness of Hintock life was fast becoming\neffaced from her observation as a singularity; just as the first\nstrangeness of a face from which we have for years been separated\ninsensibly passes off with renewed intercourse, and tones itself down\ninto simple identity with the lineaments of the past.\n\nThus Mr. Melbury went out of the house still unreconciled to the\nsacrifice of the gem he had been at such pains in mounting.  He fain\ncould hope, in the secret nether chamber of his mind, that something\nwould happen, before the balance of her feeling had quite turned in\nWinterborne's favor, to relieve his conscience and preserve her on her\nelevated plane.\n\nHe could not forget that Mrs. Charmond had apparently abandoned all\ninterest in his daughter as suddenly as she had conceived it, and was\nas firmly convinced as ever that the comradeship which Grace had shown\nwith Giles and his crew by attending his party had been the cause.\n\nMatters lingered on thus.  And then, as a hoop by gentle knocks on this\nside and on that is made to travel in specific directions, the little\ntouches of circumstance in the life of this young girl shaped the\ncurves of her career.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nIt was a day of rather bright weather for the season.  Miss Melbury\nwent out for a morning walk, and her ever-regardful father, having an\nhour's leisure, offered to walk with her.  The breeze was fresh and\nquite steady, filtering itself through the denuded mass of twigs\nwithout swaying them, but making the point of each ivy-leaf on the\ntrunks scratch its underlying neighbor restlessly.  Grace's lips sucked\nin this native air of hers like milk.  They soon reached a place where\nthe wood ran down into a corner, and went outside it towards\ncomparatively open ground. Having looked round about, they were\nintending to re-enter the copse when a fox quietly emerged with a\ndragging brush, trotted past them tamely as a domestic cat, and\ndisappeared amid some dead fern.  They walked on, her father merely\nobserving, after watching the animal, \"They are hunting somewhere near.\"\n\nFarther up they saw in the mid-distance the hounds running hither and\nthither, as if there were little or no scent that day.  Soon divers\nmembers of the hunt appeared on the scene, and it was evident from\ntheir movements that the chase had been stultified by general\npuzzle-headedness as to the whereabouts of the intended victim.  In a\nminute a farmer rode up to the two pedestrians, panting with acteonic\nexcitement, and Grace being a few steps in advance, he addressed her,\nasking if she had seen the fox.\n\n\"Yes,\" said she.  \"We saw him some time ago--just out there.\"\n\n\"Did you cry Halloo?\"\n\n\"We said nothing.\"\n\n\"Then why the d---- didn't you, or get the old buffer to do it for you?\"\nsaid the man, as he cantered away.\n\nShe looked rather disconcerted at this reply, and observing her\nfather's face, saw that it was quite red.\n\n\"He ought not to have spoken to ye like that!\" said the old man, in the\ntone of one whose heart was bruised, though it was not by the epithet\napplied to himself.  \"And he wouldn't if he had been a gentleman.\n'Twas not the language to use to a woman of any niceness.  You, so well\nread and cultivated--how could he expect ye to know what tom-boy\nfield-folk are in the habit of doing? If so be you had just come from\ntrimming swedes or mangolds--joking with the rough work-folk and all\nthat--I could have stood it.  But hasn't it cost me near a hundred a\nyear to lift you out of all that, so as to show an example to the\nneighborhood of what a woman can be? Grace, shall I tell you the secret\nof it? 'Twas because I was in your company.  If a black-coated squire\nor pa'son had been walking with you instead of me he wouldn't have\nspoken so.\"\n\n\"No, no, father; there's nothing in you rough or ill-mannered!\"\n\n\"I tell you it is that! I've noticed, and I've noticed it many times,\nthat a woman takes her color from the man she's walking with.  The\nwoman who looks an unquestionable lady when she's with a polished-up\nfellow, looks a mere tawdry imitation article when she's hobbing and\nnobbing with a homely blade.  You sha'n't be treated like that for\nlong, or at least your children sha'n't. You shall have somebody to\nwalk with you who looks more of a dandy than I--please God you shall!\"\n\n\"But, my dear father,\" she said, much distressed, \"I don't mind at all.\nI don't wish for more honor than I already have!\"\n\n\"A perplexing and ticklish possession is a daughter,\" according to\nMenander or some old Greek poet, and to nobody was one ever more so\nthan to Melbury, by reason of her very dearness to him.  As for Grace,\nshe began to feel troubled; she did not perhaps wish there and then to\nunambitiously devote her life to Giles Winterborne, but she was\nconscious of more and more uneasiness at the possibility of being the\nsocial hope of the family.\n\n\"You would like to have more honor, if it pleases me?\" asked her\nfather, in continuation of the subject.\n\nDespite her feeling she assented to this.  His reasoning had not been\nwithout its weight upon her.\n\n\"Grace,\" he said, just before they had reached the house, \"if it costs\nme my life you shall marry well! To-day has shown me that whatever a\nyoung woman's niceness, she stands for nothing alone. You shall marry\nwell.\"\n\nHe breathed heavily, and his breathing was caught up by the breeze,\nwhich seemed to sigh a soft remonstrance.\n\nShe looked calmly at him.  \"And how about Mr. Winterborne?\" she asked.\n\"I mention it, father, not as a matter of sentiment, but as a question\nof keeping faith.\"\n\nThe timber-merchant's eyes fell for a moment.  \"I don't know--I don't\nknow,\" he said.  \"'Tis a trying strait.  Well, well; there's no hurry.\nWe'll wait and see how he gets on.\"\n\nThat evening he called her into his room, a snug little apartment\nbehind the large parlor.  It had at one time been part of the\nbakehouse, with the ordinary oval brick oven in the wall; but Mr.\nMelbury, in turning it into an office, had built into the cavity an\niron safe, which he used for holding his private papers.  The door of\nthe safe was now open, and his keys were hanging from it.\n\n\"Sit down, Grace, and keep me company,\" he said.  \"You may amuse\nyourself by looking over these.\" He threw out a heap of papers before\nher.\n\n\"What are they?\" she asked.\n\n\"Securities of various sorts.\" He unfolded them one by one. \"Papers\nworth so much money each.  Now here's a lot of turnpike bonds for one\nthing.  Would you think that each of these pieces of paper is worth two\nhundred pounds?\"\n\n\"No, indeed, if you didn't say so.\"\n\n\"'Tis so, then.  Now here are papers of another sort.  They are for\ndifferent sums in the three-per-cents.  Now these are Port Breedy\nHarbor bonds.  We have a great stake in that harbor, you know, because\nI send off timber there.  Open the rest at your pleasure.  They'll\ninterest ye.\"\n\n\"Yes, I will, some day,\" said she, rising.\n\n\"Nonsense, open them now.  You ought to learn a little of such matters.\nA young lady of education should not be ignorant of money affairs\naltogether.  Suppose you should be left a widow some day, with your\nhusband's title-deeds and investments thrown upon your hands--\"\n\n\"Don't say that, father--title-deeds; it sounds so vain!\"\n\n\"It does not.  Come to that, I have title-deeds myself.  There, that\npiece of parchment represents houses in Sherton Abbas.\"\n\n\"Yes, but--\" She hesitated, looked at the fire, and went on in a low\nvoice: \"If what has been arranged about me should come to anything, my\nsphere will be quite a middling one.\"\n\n\"Your sphere ought not to be middling,\" he exclaimed, not in passion,\nbut in earnest conviction.  \"You said you never felt more at home, more\nin your element, anywhere than you did that afternoon with Mrs.\nCharmond, when she showed you her house and all her knick-knacks, and\nmade you stay to tea so nicely in her drawing-room--surely you did!\"\n\n\"Yes, I did say so,\" admitted Grace.\n\n\"Was it true?\"\n\n\"Yes, I felt so at the time.  The feeling is less strong now, perhaps.\"\n\n\"Ah! Now, though you don't see it, your feeling at the time was the\nright one, because your mind and body were just in full and fresh\ncultivation, so that going there with her was like meeting like.  Since\nthen you've been biding with us, and have fallen back a little, and so\nyou don't feel your place so strongly.  Now, do as I tell ye, and look\nover these papers and see what you'll be worth some day.  For they'll\nall be yours, you know; who have I got to leave 'em to but you?\nPerhaps when your education is backed up by what these papers\nrepresent, and that backed up by another such a set and their owner,\nmen such as that fellow was this morning may think you a little more\nthan a buffer's girl.\"\n\nSo she did as commanded, and opened each of the folded representatives\nof hard cash that her father put before her.  To sow in her heart\ncravings for social position was obviously his strong desire, though in\ndirect antagonism to a better feeling which had hitherto prevailed with\nhim, and had, indeed, only succumbed that morning during the ramble.\n\nShe wished that she was not his worldly hope; the responsibility of\nsuch a position was too great.  She had made it for herself mainly by\nher appearance and attractive behavior to him since her return.  \"If I\nhad only come home in a shabby dress, and tried to speak roughly, this\nmight not have happened,\" she thought.  She deplored less the fact than\nthe sad possibilities that might lie hidden therein.\n\nHer father then insisted upon her looking over his checkbook and\nreading the counterfoils.  This, also, she obediently did, and at last\ncame to two or three which had been drawn to defray some of the late\nexpenses of her clothes, board, and education.\n\n\"I, too, cost a good deal, like the horses and wagons and corn,\" she\nsaid, looking up sorrily.\n\n\"I didn't want you to look at those; I merely meant to give you an idea\nof my investment transactions.  But if you do cost as much as they,\nnever mind.  You'll yield a better return.\"\n\n\"Don't think of me like that!\" she begged.  \"A mere chattel.\"\n\n\"A what? Oh, a dictionary word.  Well, as that's in your line I don't\nforbid it, even if it tells against me,\" he said, good-humoredly.  And\nhe looked her proudly up and down.\n\nA few minutes later Grammer Oliver came to tell them that supper was\nready, and in giving the information she added, incidentally, \"So we\nshall soon lose the mistress of Hintock House for some time, I hear,\nMaister Melbury.  Yes, she's going off to foreign parts to-morrow, for\nthe rest of the winter months; and be-chok'd if I don't wish I could do\nthe same, for my wynd-pipe is furred like a flue.\"\n\nWhen the old woman had left the room, Melbury turned to his daughter\nand said, \"So, Grace, you've lost your new friend, and your chance of\nkeeping her company and writing her travels is quite gone from ye!\"\n\nGrace said nothing.\n\n\"Now,\" he went on, emphatically, \"'tis Winterborne's affair has done\nthis.  Oh yes, 'tis.  So let me say one word.  Promise me that you will\nnot meet him again without my knowledge.\"\n\n\"I never do meet him, father, either without your knowledge or with it.\"\n\n\"So much the better.  I don't like the look of this at all.  And I say\nit not out of harshness to him, poor fellow, but out of tenderness to\nyou.  For how could a woman, brought up delicately as you have been,\nbear the roughness of a life with him?\"\n\nShe sighed; it was a sigh of sympathy with Giles, complicated by a\nsense of the intractability of circumstances.\n\n\nAt that same hour, and almost at that same minute, there was a\nconversation about Winterborne in progress in the village street,\nopposite Mr. Melbury's gates, where Timothy Tangs the elder and Robert\nCreedle had accidentally met.\n\nThe sawyer was asking Creedle if he had heard what was all over the\nparish, the skin of his face being drawn two ways on the\nmatter--towards brightness in respect of it as news, and towards\nconcern in respect of it as circumstance.\n\n\"Why, that poor little lonesome thing, Marty South, is likely to lose\nher father.  He was almost well, but is much worse again.  A man all\nskin and grief he ever were, and if he leave Little Hintock for a\nbetter land, won't it make some difference to your Maister Winterborne,\nneighbor Creedle?\"\n\n\"Can I be a prophet in Israel?\" said Creedle.  \"Won't it! I was only\nshaping of such a thing yesterday in my poor, long-seeing way, and all\nthe work of the house upon my one shoulders! You know what it means? It\nis upon John South's life that all Mr. Winterborne's houses hang.  If\nso be South die, and so make his decease, thereupon the law is that the\nhouses fall without the least chance of absolution into HER hands at\nthe House.  I told him so; but the words of the faithful be only as\nwind!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nThe news was true.  The life--the one fragile life--that had been used\nas a measuring-tape of time by law, was in danger of being frayed away.\nIt was the last of a group of lives which had served this purpose, at\nthe end of whose breathings the small homestead occupied by South\nhimself, the larger one of Giles Winterborne, and half a dozen others\nthat had been in the possession of various Hintock village families for\nthe previous hundred years, and were now Winterborne's, would fall in\nand become part of the encompassing estate.\n\nYet a short two months earlier Marty's father, aged fifty-five years,\nthough something of a fidgety, anxious being, would have been looked on\nas a man whose existence was so far removed from hazardous as any in\nthe parish, and as bidding fair to be prolonged for another quarter of\na century.\n\nWinterborne walked up and down his garden next day thinking of the\ncontingency.  The sense that the paths he was pacing, the\ncabbage-plots, the apple-trees, his dwelling, cider-cellar,\nwring-house, stables, and weathercock, were all slipping away over his\nhead and beneath his feet, as if they were painted on a magic-lantern\nslide, was curious.  In spite of John South's late indisposition he had\nnot anticipated danger.  To inquire concerning his health had been to\nshow less sympathy than to remain silent, considering the material\ninterest he possessed in the woodman's life, and he had, accordingly,\nmade a point of avoiding Marty's house.\n\nWhile he was here in the garden somebody came to fetch him.  It was\nMarty herself, and she showed her distress by her unconsciousness of a\ncropped poll.\n\n\"Father is still so much troubled in his mind about that tree,\" she\nsaid.  \"You know the tree I mean, Mr. Winterborne? the tall one in\nfront of the house, that he thinks will blow down and kill us.  Can you\ncome and see if you can persuade him out of his notion? I can do\nnothing.\"\n\nHe accompanied her to the cottage, and she conducted him upstairs.\nJohn South was pillowed up in a chair between the bed and the window\nexactly opposite the latter, towards which his face was turned.\n\n\"Ah, neighbor Winterborne,\" he said.  \"I wouldn't have minded if my\nlife had only been my own to lose; I don't vallie it in much of itself,\nand can let it go if 'tis required of me.  But to think what 'tis worth\nto you, a young man rising in life, that do trouble me! It seems a\ntrick of dishonesty towards ye to go off at fifty-five! I could bear\nup, I know I could, if it were not for the tree--yes, the tree, 'tis\nthat's killing me.  There he stands, threatening my life every minute\nthat the wind do blow.  He'll come down upon us and squat us dead; and\nwhat will ye do when the life on your property is taken away?\"\n\n\"Never you mind me--that's of no consequence,\" said Giles.  \"Think of\nyourself alone.\"\n\nHe looked out of the window in the direction of the woodman's gaze.\nThe tree was a tall elm, familiar to him from childhood, which stood at\na distance of two-thirds its own height from the front of South's\ndwelling.  Whenever the wind blew, as it did now, the tree rocked,\nnaturally enough; and the sight of its motion and sound of its sighs\nhad gradually bred the terrifying illusion in the woodman's mind that\nit would descend and kill him.  Thus he would sit all day, in spite of\npersuasion, watching its every sway, and listening to the melancholy\nGregorian melodies which the air wrung out of it.  This fear it\napparently was, rather than any organic disease which was eating away\nthe health of John South.\n\nAs the tree waved, South waved his head, making it his flugel-man with\nabject obedience.  \"Ah, when it was quite a small tree,\" he said, \"and\nI was a little boy, I thought one day of chopping it off with my hook\nto make a clothes-line prop with.  But I put off doing it, and then I\nagain thought that I would; but I forgot it, and didn't.  And at last\nit got too big, and now 'tis my enemy, and will be the death o' me.\nLittle did I think, when I let that sapling stay, that a time would\ncome when it would torment me, and dash me into my grave.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said Winterborne and Marty, soothingly.  But they thought it\npossible that it might hasten him into his grave, though in another way\nthan by falling.\n\n\"I tell you what,\" added Winterborne, \"I'll climb up this afternoon and\nshroud off the lower boughs, and then it won't be so heavy, and the\nwind won't affect it so.\"\n\n\"She won't allow it--a strange woman come from nobody knows where--she\nwon't have it done.\"\n\n\"You mean Mrs. Charmond?  Oh, she doesn't know there's such a tree on\nher estate.  Besides, shrouding is not felling, and I'll risk that\nmuch.\"\n\nHe went out, and when afternoon came he returned, took a billhook from\nthe woodman's shed, and with a ladder climbed into the lower part of\nthe tree, where he began lopping off--\"shrouding,\" as they called it at\nHintock--the lowest boughs.  Each of these quivered under his attack,\nbent, cracked, and fell into the hedge.  Having cut away the lowest\ntier, he stepped off the ladder, climbed a few steps higher, and\nattacked those at the next level.  Thus he ascended with the progress\nof his work far above the top of the ladder, cutting away his perches\nas he went, and leaving nothing but a bare stem below him.\n\nThe work was troublesome, for the tree was large.  The afternoon wore\non, turning dark and misty about four o'clock.  From time to time Giles\ncast his eyes across towards the bedroom window of South, where, by the\nflickering fire in the chamber, he could see the old man watching him,\nsitting motionless with a hand upon each arm of the chair.  Beside him\nsat Marty, also straining her eyes towards the skyey field of his\noperations.\n\nA curious question suddenly occurred to Winterborne, and he stopped his\nchopping.  He was operating on another person's property to prolong the\nyears of a lease by whose termination that person would considerably\nbenefit.  In that aspect of the case he doubted if he ought to go on.\nOn the other hand he was working to save a man's life, and this seemed\nto empower him to adopt arbitrary measures.\n\nThe wind had died down to a calm, and while he was weighing the\ncircumstances he saw coming along the road through the increasing mist\na figure which, indistinct as it was, he knew well.  It was Grace\nMelbury, on her way out from the house, probably for a short evening\nwalk before dark.  He arranged himself for a greeting from her, since\nshe could hardly avoid passing immediately beneath the tree.\n\nBut Grace, though she looked up and saw him, was just at that time too\nfull of the words of her father to give him any encouragement. The\nyears-long regard that she had had for him was not kindled by her\nreturn into a flame of sufficient brilliancy to make her rebellious.\nThinking that she might not see him, he cried, \"Miss Melbury, here I\nam.\"\n\nShe looked up again.  She was near enough to see the expression of his\nface, and the nails in his soles, silver-bright with constant walking.\nBut she did not reply; and dropping her glance again, went on.\n\nWinterborne's face grew strange; he mused, and proceeded automatically\nwith his work.  Grace meanwhile had not gone far. She had reached a\ngate, whereon she had leaned sadly, and whispered to herself, \"What\nshall I do?\"\n\nA sudden fog came on, and she curtailed her walk, passing under the\ntree again on her return.  Again he addressed her.  \"Grace,\" he said,\nwhen she was close to the trunk, \"speak to me.\" She shook her head\nwithout stopping, and went on to a little distance, where she stood\nobserving him from behind the hedge.\n\nHer coldness had been kindly meant.  If it was to be done, she had said\nto herself, it should be begun at once.  While she stood out of\nobservation Giles seemed to recognize her meaning; with a sudden start\nhe worked on, climbing higher, and cutting himself off more and more\nfrom all intercourse with the sublunary world. At last he had worked\nhimself so high up the elm, and the mist had so thickened, that he\ncould only just be discerned as a dark-gray spot on the light-gray sky:\nhe would have been altogether out of notice but for the stroke of his\nbillhook and the flight of a bough downward, and its crash upon the\nhedge at intervals.\n\nIt was not to be done thus, after all: plainness and candor were best.\nShe went back a third time; he did not see her now, and she lingeringly\ngazed up at his unconscious figure, loath to put an end to any kind of\nhope that might live on in him still. \"Giles--  Mr. Winterborne,\" she\nsaid.\n\nHe was so high amid the fog that he did not hear.  \"Mr. Winterborne!\"\nshe cried again, and this time he stopped, looked down, and replied.\n\n\"My silence just now was not accident,\" she said, in an unequal voice.\n\"My father says it is best not to think too much of that--engagement,\nor understanding between us, that you know of.  I, too, think that upon\nthe whole he is right.  But we are friends, you know, Giles, and almost\nrelations.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" he answered, as if without surprise, in a voice which\nbarely reached down the tree.  \"I have nothing to say in objection--I\ncannot say anything till I've thought a while.\"\n\nShe added, with emotion in her tone, \"For myself, I would have married\nyou--some day--I think.  But I give way, for I see it would be unwise.\"\n\nHe made no reply, but sat back upon a bough, placed his elbow in a\nfork, and rested his head upon his hand.  Thus he remained till the fog\nand the night had completely enclosed him from her view.\n\nGrace heaved a divided sigh, with a tense pause between, and moved\nonward, her heart feeling uncomfortably big and heavy, and her eyes\nwet.  Had Giles, instead of remaining still, immediately come down from\nthe tree to her, would she have continued in that filial acquiescent\nframe of mind which she had announced to him as final? If it be true,\nas women themselves have declared, that one of their sex is never so\nmuch inclined to throw in her lot with a man for good and all as five\nminutes after she has told him such a thing cannot be, the\nprobabilities are that something might have been done by the appearance\nof Winterborne on the ground beside Grace. But he continued motionless\nand silent in that gloomy Niflheim or fog-land which involved him, and\nshe proceeded on her way.\n\nThe spot seemed now to be quite deserted.  The light from South's\nwindow made rays on the fog, but did not reach the tree.  A quarter of\nan hour passed, and all was blackness overhead.  Giles had not yet come\ndown.\n\nThen the tree seemed to shiver, then to heave a sigh; a movement was\naudible, and Winterborne dropped almost noiselessly to the ground.  He\nhad thought the matter out, and having returned the ladder and billhook\nto their places, pursued his way homeward.  He would not allow this\nincident to affect his outer conduct any more than the danger to his\nleaseholds had done, and went to bed as usual.  Two simultaneous\ntroubles do not always make a double trouble; and thus it came to pass\nthat Giles's practical anxiety about his houses, which would have been\nenough to keep him awake half the night at any other time, was\ndisplaced and not reinforced by his sentimental trouble about Grace\nMelbury.  This severance was in truth more like a burial of her than a\nrupture with her; but he did not realize so much at present; even when\nhe arose in the morning he felt quite moody and stern: as yet the\nsecond note in the gamut of such emotions, a tender regret for his\nloss, had not made itself heard.\n\nA load of oak timber was to be sent away that morning to a builder\nwhose works were in a town many miles off.  The proud trunks were taken\nup from the silent spot which had known them through the buddings and\nsheddings of their growth for the foregoing hundred years; chained down\nlike slaves to a heavy timber carriage with enormous red wheels, and\nfour of the most powerful of Melbury's horses were harnessed in front\nto draw them.\n\nThe horses wore their bells that day.  There were sixteen to the team,\ncarried on a frame above each animal's shoulders, and tuned to scale,\nso as to form two octaves, running from the highest note on the right\nor off-side of the leader to the lowest on the left or near-side of the\nshaft-horse.  Melbury was among the last to retain horse-bells in that\nneighborhood; for, living at Little Hintock, where the lanes yet\nremained as narrow as before the days of turnpike roads, these\nsound-signals were still as useful to him and his neighbors as they had\never been in former times.  Much backing was saved in the course of a\nyear by the warning notes they cast ahead; moreover, the tones of all\nthe teams in the district being known to the carters of each, they\ncould tell a long way off on a dark night whether they were about to\nencounter friends or strangers.\n\nThe fog of the previous evening still lingered so heavily over the\nwoods that the morning could not penetrate the trees till long after\nits time.  The load being a ponderous one, the lane crooked, and the\nair so thick, Winterborne set out, as he often did, to accompany the\nteam as far as the corner, where it would turn into a wider road.\n\nSo they rumbled on, shaking the foundations of the roadside cottages by\nthe weight of their progress, the sixteen bells chiming harmoniously\nover all, till they had risen out of the valley and were descending\ntowards the more open route, the sparks rising from their creaking skid\nand nearly setting fire to the dead leaves alongside.\n\nThen occurred one of the very incidents against which the bells were an\nendeavor to guard.  Suddenly there beamed into their eyes, quite close\nto them, the two lamps of a carriage, shorn of rays by the fog.  Its\napproach had been quite unheard, by reason of their own noise.  The\ncarriage was a covered one, while behind it could be discerned another\nvehicle laden with luggage.\n\nWinterborne went to the head of the team, and heard the coachman\ntelling the carter that he must turn back.  The carter declared that\nthis was impossible.\n\n\"You can turn if you unhitch your string-horses,\" said the coachman.\n\n\"It is much easier for you to turn than for us,\" said Winterborne.\n\"We've five tons of timber on these wheels if we've an ounce.\"\n\n\"But I've another carriage with luggage at my back.\"\n\nWinterborne admitted the strength of the argument.  \"But even with\nthat,\" he said, \"you can back better than we.  And you ought to, for\nyou could hear our bells half a mile off.\"\n\n\"And you could see our lights.\"\n\n\"We couldn't, because of the fog.\"\n\n\"Well, our time's precious,\" said the coachman, haughtily.  \"You are\nonly going to some trumpery little village or other in the\nneighborhood, while we are going straight to Italy.\"\n\n\"Driving all the way, I suppose,\" said Winterborne, sarcastically.\n\nThe argument continued in these terms till a voice from the interior of\nthe carriage inquired what was the matter.  It was a lady's.\n\nShe was briefly informed of the timber people's obstinacy; and then\nGiles could hear her telling the footman to direct the timber people to\nturn their horses' heads.\n\nThe message was brought, and Winterborne sent the bearer back to say\nthat he begged the lady's pardon, but that he could not do as she\nrequested; that though he would not assert it to be impossible, it was\nimpossible by comparison with the slight difficulty to her party to\nback their light carriages.  As fate would have it, the incident with\nGrace Melbury on the previous day made Giles less gentle than he might\notherwise have shown himself, his confidence in the sex being rudely\nshaken.\n\nIn fine, nothing could move him, and the carriages were compelled to\nback till they reached one of the sidings or turnouts constructed in\nthe bank for the purpose.  Then the team came on ponderously, and the\nclanging of its sixteen bells as it passed the discomfited carriages,\ntilted up against the bank, lent a particularly triumphant tone to the\nteam's progress--a tone which, in point of fact, did not at all attach\nto its conductor's feelings.\n\nGiles walked behind the timber, and just as he had got past the yet\nstationary carriages he heard a soft voice say, \"Who is that rude man?\nNot Melbury?\" The sex of the speaker was so prominent in the voice that\nWinterborne felt a pang of regret.\n\n\"No, ma'am.  A younger man, in a smaller way of business in Little\nHintock.  Winterborne is his name.\"\n\nThus they parted company.  \"Why, Mr. Winterborne,\" said the wagoner,\nwhen they were out of hearing, \"that was She--Mrs. Charmond! Who'd ha'\nthought it? What in the world can a woman that does nothing be\ncock-watching out here at this time o' day for? Oh, going to Italy--yes\nto be sure, I heard she was going abroad, she can't endure the winter\nhere.\"\n\nWinterborne was vexed at the incident; the more so that he knew Mr.\nMelbury, in his adoration of Hintock House, would be the first to blame\nhim if it became known.  But saying no more, he accompanied the load to\nthe end of the lane, and then turned back with an intention to call at\nSouth's to learn the result of the experiment of the preceding evening.\n\nIt chanced that a few minutes before this time Grace Melbury, who now\nrose soon enough to breakfast with her father, in spite of the\nunwontedness of the hour, had been commissioned by him to make the same\ninquiry at South's.  Marty had been standing at the door when Miss\nMelbury arrived.  Almost before the latter had spoken, Mrs. Charmond's\ncarriages, released from the obstruction up the lane, came bowling\nalong, and the two girls turned to regard the spectacle.\n\nMrs. Charmond did not see them, but there was sufficient light for them\nto discern her outline between the carriage windows.  A noticeable\nfeature in her tournure was a magnificent mass of braided locks.\n\n\"How well she looks this morning!\" said Grace, forgetting Mrs.\nCharmond's slight in her generous admiration.  \"Her hair so becomes her\nworn that way.  I have never seen any more beautiful!\"\n\n\"Nor have I, miss,\" said Marty, dryly, unconsciously stroking her crown.\n\nGrace watched the carriages with lingering regret till they were out of\nsight.  She then learned of Marty that South was no better. Before she\nhad come away Winterborne approached the house, but seeing that one of\nthe two girls standing on the door-step was Grace, he suddenly turned\nback again and sought the shelter of his own home till she should have\ngone away.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nThe encounter with the carriages having sprung upon Winterborne's mind\nthe image of Mrs. Charmond, his thoughts by a natural channel went from\nher to the fact that several cottages and other houses in the two\nHintocks, now his own, would fall into her possession in the event of\nSouth's death.  He marvelled what people could have been thinking about\nin the past to invent such precarious tenures as these; still more,\nwhat could have induced his ancestors at Hintock, and other village\npeople, to exchange their old copyholds for life-leases.  But having\nnaturally succeeded to these properties through his father, he had done\nhis best to keep them in order, though he was much struck with his\nfather's negligence in not insuring South's life.\n\nAfter breakfast, still musing on the circumstances, he went upstairs,\nturned over his bed, and drew out a flat canvas bag which lay between\nthe mattress and the sacking.  In this he kept his leases, which had\nremained there unopened ever since his father's death.  It was the\nusual hiding-place among rural lifeholders for such documents.\nWinterborne sat down on the bed and looked them over.  They were\nordinary leases for three lives, which a member of the South family,\nsome fifty years before this time, had accepted of the lord of the\nmanor in lieu of certain copyholds and other rights, in consideration\nof having the dilapidated houses rebuilt by said lord.  They had come\ninto his father's possession chiefly through his mother, who was a\nSouth.\n\nPinned to the parchment of one of the indentures was a letter, which\nWinterborne had never seen before.  It bore a remote date, the\nhandwriting being that of some solicitor or agent, and the signature\nthe landholder's.  It was to the effect that at any time before the\nlast of the stated lives should drop, Mr. Giles Winterborne, senior, or\nhis representative, should have the privilege of adding his own and his\nson's life to the life remaining on payment of a merely nominal sum;\nthe concession being in consequence of the elder Winterborne's consent\nto demolish one of the houses and relinquish its site, which stood at\nan awkward corner of the lane and impeded the way.\n\nThe house had been pulled down years before.  Why Giles's father had\nnot taken advantage of his privilege to insert his own and his son's\nlives it was impossible to say.  The likelihood was that death alone\nhad hindered him in the execution of his project, as it surely was, the\nelder Winterborne having been a man who took much pleasure in dealing\nwith house property in his small way.\n\nSince one of the Souths still survived, there was not much doubt that\nGiles could do what his father had left undone, as far as his own life\nwas concerned.  This possibility cheered him much, for by those houses\nhung many things.  Melbury's doubt of the young man's fitness to be the\nhusband of Grace had been based not a little on the precariousness of\nhis holdings in Little and Great Hintock. He resolved to attend to the\nbusiness at once, the fine for renewal being a sum that he could easily\nmuster.  His scheme, however, could not be carried out in a day; and\nmeanwhile he would run up to South's, as he had intended to do, to\nlearn the result of the experiment with the tree.\n\nMarty met him at the door.  \"Well, Marty,\" he said; and was surprised\nto read in her face that the case was not so hopeful as he had imagined.\n\n\"I am sorry for your labor,\" she said.  \"It is all lost.  He says the\ntree seems taller than ever.\"\n\nWinterborne looked round at it.  Taller the tree certainly did seem,\nthe gauntness of its now naked stem being more marked than before.\n\n\"It quite terrified him when he first saw what you had done to it this\nmorning,\" she added.  \"He declares it will come down upon us and cleave\nus, like 'the sword of the Lord and of Gideon.'\"\n\n\"Well; can I do anything else?\" asked he.\n\n\"The doctor says the tree ought to be cut down.\"\n\n\"Oh--you've had the doctor?\"\n\n\"I didn't send for him. Mrs. Charmond, before she left, heard that\nfather was ill, and told him to attend him at her expense.\"\n\n\"That was very good of her.  And he says it ought to be cut down. We\nmustn't cut it down without her knowledge, I suppose.\"\n\nHe went up-stairs.  There the old man sat, staring at the now gaunt\ntree as if his gaze were frozen on to its trunk.  Unluckily the tree\nwaved afresh by this time, a wind having sprung up and blown the fog\naway, and his eyes turned with its wavings.\n\nThey heard footsteps--a man's, but of a lighter type than usual. \"There\nis Doctor Fitzpiers again,\" she said, and descended. Presently his\ntread was heard on the naked stairs.\n\nMr. Fitzpiers entered the sick-chamber just as a doctor is more or less\nwont to do on such occasions, and pre-eminently when the room is that\nof a humble cottager, looking round towards the patient with that\npreoccupied gaze which so plainly reveals that he has wellnigh\nforgotten all about the case and the whole circumstances since he\ndismissed them from his mind at his last exit from the same apartment.\nHe nodded to Winterborne, with whom he was already a little acquainted,\nrecalled the case to his thoughts, and went leisurely on to where South\nsat.\n\nFitzpiers was, on the whole, a finely formed, handsome man.  His eyes\nwere dark and impressive, and beamed with the light either of energy or\nof susceptivity--it was difficult to say which; it might have been a\nlittle of both.  That quick, glittering, practical eye, sharp for the\nsurface of things and for nothing beneath it, he had not.  But whether\nhis apparent depth of vision was real, or only an artistic accident of\nhis corporeal moulding, nothing but his deeds could reveal.\n\nHis face was rather soft than stern, charming than grand, pale than\nflushed; his nose--if a sketch of his features be de rigueur for a\nperson of his pretensions--was artistically beautiful enough to have\nbeen worth doing in marble by any sculptor not over-busy, and was hence\ndevoid of those knotty irregularities which often mean power; while the\ndouble-cyma or classical curve of his mouth was not without a looseness\nin its close.  Nevertheless, either from his readily appreciative mien,\nor his reflective manner, or the instinct towards profound things which\nwas said to possess him, his presence bespoke the philosopher rather\nthan the dandy or macaroni--an effect which was helped by the absence\nof trinkets or other trivialities from his attire, though this was more\nfinished and up to date than is usually the case among rural\npractitioners.\n\nStrict people of the highly respectable class, knowing a little about\nhim by report, might have said that he seemed likely to err rather in\nthe possession of too many ideas than too few; to be a dreamy 'ist of\nsome sort, or too deeply steeped in some false kind of 'ism.  However\nthis may be, it will be seen that he was undoubtedly a somewhat rare\nkind of gentleman and doctor to have descended, as from the clouds,\nupon Little Hintock.\n\n\"This is an extraordinary case,\" he said at last to Winterborne, after\nexamining South by conversation, look, and touch, and learning that the\ncraze about the elm was stronger than ever. \"Come down-stairs, and I'll\ntell you what I think.\"\n\nThey accordingly descended, and the doctor continued, \"The tree must be\ncut down, or I won't answer for his life.\"\n\n\"'Tis Mrs. Charmond's tree, and I suppose we must get permission?\" said\nGiles.  \"If so, as she is gone away, I must speak to her agent.\"\n\n\"Oh--never mind whose tree it is--what's a tree beside a life! Cut it\ndown.  I have not the honor of knowing Mrs. Charmond as yet, but I am\ndisposed to risk that much with her.\"\n\n\"'Tis timber,\" rejoined Giles, more scrupulous than he would have been\nhad not his own interests stood so closely involved. \"They'll never\nfell a stick about here without it being marked first, either by her or\nthe agent.\"\n\n\"Then we'll inaugurate a new era forthwith.  How long has he complained\nof the tree?\" asked the doctor of Marty.\n\n\"Weeks and weeks, sir.  The shape of it seems to haunt him like an evil\nspirit.  He says that it is exactly his own age, that it has got human\nsense, and sprouted up when he was born on purpose to rule him, and\nkeep him as its slave.  Others have been like it afore in Hintock.\"\n\nThey could hear South's voice up-stairs \"Oh, he's rocking this way; he\nmust come! And then my poor life, that's worth houses upon houses, will\nbe squashed out o' me.  Oh! oh!\"\n\n\"That's how he goes on,\" she added.  \"And he'll never look anywhere\nelse but out of the window, and scarcely have the curtains drawn.\"\n\n\"Down with it, then, and hang Mrs. Charmond,\" said Mr. Fitzpiers. \"The\nbest plan will be to wait till the evening, when it is dark, or early\nin the morning before he is awake, so that he doesn't see it fall, for\nthat would terrify him worse than ever.  Keep the blind down till I\ncome, and then I'll assure him, and show him that his trouble is over.\"\n\nThe doctor then departed, and they waited till the evening.  When it\nwas dusk, and the curtains drawn, Winterborne directed a couple of\nwoodmen to bring a crosscut-saw, and the tall, threatening tree was\nsoon nearly off at its base.  He would not fell it completely then, on\naccount of the possible crash, but next morning, before South was\nawake, they went and lowered it cautiously, in a direction away from\nthe cottage.  It was a business difficult to do quite silently; but it\nwas done at last, and the elm of the same birth-year as the woodman's\nlay stretched upon the ground. The weakest idler that passed could now\nset foot on marks formerly made in the upper forks by the shoes of\nadventurous climbers only; once inaccessible nests could be examined\nmicroscopically; and on swaying extremities where birds alone had\nperched, the by-standers sat down.\n\nAs soon as it was broad daylight the doctor came, and Winterborne\nentered the house with him.  Marty said that her father was wrapped up\nand ready, as usual, to be put into his chair.  They ascended the\nstairs, and soon seated him.  He began at once to complain of the tree,\nand the danger to his life and Winterborne's house-property in\nconsequence.\n\nThe doctor signalled to Giles, who went and drew back the printed\ncotton curtains.  \"'Tis gone, see,\" said Mr. Fitzpiers.\n\nAs soon as the old man saw the vacant patch of sky in place of the\nbranched column so familiar to his gaze, he sprang up, speechless, his\neyes rose from their hollows till the whites showed all round; he fell\nback, and a bluish whiteness overspread him.\n\nGreatly alarmed, they put him on the bed.  As soon as he came a little\nout of his fit, he gasped, \"Oh, it is gone!--where?--where?\"\n\nHis whole system seemed paralyzed by amazement.  They were\nthunder-struck at the result of the experiment, and did all they could.\nNothing seemed to avail.  Giles and Fitzpiers went and came, but\nuselessly.  He lingered through the day, and died that evening as the\nsun went down.\n\n\"D--d if my remedy hasn't killed him!\" murmured the doctor.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nWhen Melbury heard what had happened he seemed much moved, and walked\nthoughtfully about the premises.  On South's own account he was\ngenuinely sorry; and on Winterborne's he was the more grieved in that\nthis catastrophe had so closely followed the somewhat harsh dismissal\nof Giles as the betrothed of his daughter.\n\nHe was quite angry with circumstances for so heedlessly inflicting on\nGiles a second trouble when the needful one inflicted by himself was\nall that the proper order of events demanded.  \"I told Giles's father\nwhen he came into those houses not to spend too much money on lifehold\nproperty held neither for his own life nor his son's,\" he exclaimed.\n\"But he wouldn't listen to me.  And now Giles has to suffer for it.\"\n\n\"Poor Giles!\" murmured Grace.\n\n\"Now, Grace, between us two, it is very, very remarkable.  It is almost\nas if I had foreseen this; and I am thankful for your escape, though I\nam sincerely sorry for Giles.  Had we not dismissed him already, we\ncould hardly have found it in our hearts to dismiss him now.  So I say,\nbe thankful.  I'll do all I can for him as a friend; but as a pretender\nto the position of my son-in law, that can never be thought of more.\"\n\nAnd yet at that very moment the impracticability to which poor\nWinterborne's suit had been reduced was touching Grace's heart to a\nwarmer sentiment on his behalf than she had felt for years concerning\nhim.\n\nHe, meanwhile, was sitting down alone in the old familiar house which\nhad ceased to be his, taking a calm if somewhat dismal survey of\naffairs.  The pendulum of the clock bumped every now and then against\none side of the case in which it swung, as the muffled drum to his\nworldly march.  Looking out of the window he could perceive that a\nparalysis had come over Creedle's occupation of manuring the garden,\nowing, obviously, to a conviction that they might not be living there\nlong enough to profit by next season's crop.\n\nHe looked at the leases again and the letter attached.  There was no\ndoubt that he had lost his houses by an accident which might easily\nhave been circumvented if he had known the true conditions of his\nholding.  The time for performance had now lapsed in strict law; but\nmight not the intention be considered by the landholder when she became\naware of the circumstances, and his moral right to retain the holdings\nfor the term of his life be conceded?\n\nHis heart sank within him when he perceived that despite all the legal\nreciprocities and safeguards prepared and written, the upshot of the\nmatter amounted to this, that it depended upon the mere caprice--good\nor ill--of the woman he had met the day before in such an unfortunate\nway, whether he was to possess his houses for life or no.\n\nWhile he was sitting and thinking a step came to the door, and Melbury\nappeared, looking very sorry for his position. Winterborne welcomed him\nby a word and a look, and went on with his examination of the\nparchments.  His visitor sat down.\n\n\"Giles,\" he said, \"this is very awkward, and I am sorry for it. What\nare you going to do?\"\n\nGiles informed him of the real state of affairs, and how barely he had\nmissed availing himself of his chance of renewal.\n\n\"What a misfortune! Why was this neglected?  Well, the best thing you\ncan do is to write and tell her all about it, and throw yourself upon\nher generosity.\"\n\n\"I would rather not,\" murmured Giles.\n\n\"But you must,\" said Melbury.\n\nIn short, he argued so cogently that Giles allowed himself to be\npersuaded, and the letter to Mrs. Charmond was written and sent to\nHintock House, whence, as he knew, it would at once be forwarded to her.\n\nMelbury feeling that he had done so good an action in coming as almost\nto extenuate his previous arbitrary conduct to nothing, went home; and\nGiles was left alone to the suspense of waiting for a reply from the\ndivinity who shaped the ends of the Hintock population.  By this time\nall the villagers knew of the circumstances, and being wellnigh like\none family, a keen interest was the result all round.\n\nEverybody thought of Giles; nobody thought of Marty.  Had any of them\nlooked in upon her during those moonlight nights which preceded the\nburial of her father, they would have seen the girl absolutely alone in\nthe house with the dead man.  Her own chamber being nearest the stairs,\nthe coffin had been placed there for convenience; and at a certain hour\nof the night, when the moon arrived opposite the window, its beams\nstreamed across the still profile of South, sublimed by the august\npresence of death, and onward a few feet farther upon the face of his\ndaughter, lying in her little bed in the stillness of a repose almost\nas dignified as that of her companion--the repose of a guileless soul\nthat had nothing more left on earth to lose, except a life which she\ndid not overvalue.\n\nSouth was buried, and a week passed, and Winterborne watched for a\nreply from Mrs. Charmond.  Melbury was very sanguine as to its tenor;\nbut Winterborne had not told him of the encounter with her carriage,\nwhen, if ever he had heard an affronted tone on a woman's lips, he had\nheard it on hers.\n\nThe postman's time for passing was just after Melbury's men had\nassembled in the spar-house; and Winterborne, who when not busy on his\nown account would lend assistance there, used to go out into the lane\nevery morning and meet the post-man at the end of one of the green\nrides through the hazel copse, in the straight stretch of which his\nladen figure could be seen a long way off.  Grace also was very\nanxious; more anxious than her father; more, perhaps, than Winterborne\nhimself.  This anxiety led her into the spar-house on some pretext or\nother almost every morning while they were awaiting the reply.\n\nFitzpiers too, though he did not personally appear, was much\ninterested, and not altogether easy in his mind; for he had been\ninformed by an authority of what he had himself conjectured, that if\nthe tree had been allowed to stand, the old man would have gone on\ncomplaining, but might have lived for twenty years.\n\nEleven times had Winterborne gone to that corner of the ride, and\nlooked up its long straight slope through the wet grays of winter dawn.\nBut though the postman's bowed figure loomed in view pretty regularly,\nhe brought nothing for Giles.  On the twelfth day the man of missives,\nwhile yet in the extreme distance, held up his hand, and Winterborne\nsaw a letter in it.  He took it into the spar-house before he broke the\nseal, and those who were there gathered round him while he read, Grace\nlooking in at the door.\n\nThe letter was not from Mrs. Charmond herself, but her agent at\nSherton.  Winterborne glanced it over and looked up.\n\n\"It's all over,\" he said.\n\n\"Ah!\" said they altogether.\n\n\"Her lawyer is instructed to say that Mrs. Charmond sees no reason for\ndisturbing the natural course of things, particularly as she\ncontemplates pulling the houses down,\" he said, quietly.\n\n\"Only think of that!\" said several.\n\nWinterborne had turned away, and said vehemently to himself, \"Then let\nher pull 'em down, and be d--d to her!\"\n\nCreedle looked at him with a face of seven sorrows, saying, \"Ah, 'twas\nthat sperrit that lost 'em for ye, maister!\"\n\nWinterborne subdued his feelings, and from that hour, whatever they\nwere, kept them entirely to himself.  There could be no doubt that, up\nto this last moment, he had nourished a feeble hope of regaining Grace\nin the event of this negotiation turning out a success.  Not being\naware of the fact that her father could have settled upon her a fortune\nsufficient to enable both to live in comfort, he deemed it now an\nabsurdity to dream any longer of such a vanity as making her his wife,\nand sank into silence forthwith.\n\nYet whatever the value of taciturnity to a man among strangers, it is\napt to express more than talkativeness when he dwells among friends.\nThe countryman who is obliged to judge the time of day from changes in\nexternal nature sees a thousand successive tints and traits in the\nlandscape which are never discerned by him who hears the regular chime\nof a clock, because they are never in request.  In like manner do we\nuse our eyes on our taciturn comrade.  The infinitesimal movement of\nmuscle, curve, hair, and wrinkle, which when accompanied by a voice\ngoes unregarded, is watched and translated in the lack of it, till\nvirtually the whole surrounding circle of familiars is charged with the\nreserved one's moods and meanings.\n\nThis was the condition of affairs between Winterborne and his neighbors\nafter his stroke of ill-luck.  He held his tongue; and they observed\nhim, and knew that he was discomposed.\n\nMr. Melbury, in his compunction, thought more of the matter than any\none else, except his daughter.  Had Winterborne been going on in the\nold fashion, Grace's father could have alluded to his disapproval of\nthe alliance every day with the greatest frankness; but to speak any\nfurther on the subject he could not find it in his heart to do now.  He\nhoped that Giles would of his own accord make some final announcement\nthat he entirely withdrew his pretensions to Grace, and so get the\nthing past and done with. For though Giles had in a measure acquiesced\nin the wish of her family, he could make matters unpleasant if he chose\nto work upon Grace; and hence, when Melbury saw the young man\napproaching along the road one day, he kept friendliness and frigidity\nexactly balanced in his eye till he could see whether Giles's manner\nwas presumptive or not.\n\nHis manner was that of a man who abandoned all claims.  \"I am glad to\nmeet ye, Mr. Melbury,\" he said, in a low voice, whose quality he\nendeavored to make as practical as possible.  \"I am afraid I shall not\nbe able to keep that mare I bought, and as I don't care to sell her, I\nshould like--if you don't object--to give her to Miss Melbury.  The\nhorse is very quiet, and would be quite safe for her.\"\n\nMr. Melbury was rather affected at this.  \"You sha'n't hurt your pocket\nlike that on our account, Giles.  Grace shall have the horse, but I'll\npay you what you gave for her, and any expense you may have been put to\nfor her keep.\"\n\nHe would not hear of any other terms, and thus it was arranged. They\nwere now opposite Melbury's house, and the timber-merchant pressed\nWinterborne to enter, Grace being out of the way.\n\n\"Pull round the settle, Giles,\" said the timber-merchant, as soon as\nthey were within.  \"I should like to have a serious talk with you.\"\n\nThereupon he put the case to Winterborne frankly, and in quite a\nfriendly way.  He declared that he did not like to be hard on a man\nwhen he was in difficulty; but he really did not see how Winterborne\ncould marry his daughter now, without even a house to take her to.\n\nGiles quite acquiesced in the awkwardness of his situation.  But from a\nmomentary feeling that he would like to know Grace's mind from her own\nlips, he did not speak out positively there and then. He accordingly\ndeparted somewhat abruptly, and went home to consider whether he would\nseek to bring about a meeting with her.\n\nIn the evening, while he sat quietly pondering, he fancied that he\nheard a scraping on the wall outside his house.  The boughs of a\nmonthly rose which grew there made such a noise sometimes, but as no\nwind was stirring he knew that it could not be the rose-tree. He took\nup the candle and went out.  Nobody was near.  As he turned, the light\nflickered on the whitewashed rough case of the front, and he saw words\nwritten thereon in charcoal, which he read as follows:\n\n    \"O Giles, you've lost your dwelling-place,\n     And therefore, Giles, you'll lose your Grace.\"\n\n\nGiles went in-doors.  He had his suspicions as to the scrawler of those\nlines, but he could not be sure.  What suddenly filled his heart far\nmore than curiosity about their authorship was a terrible belief that\nthey were turning out to be true, try to see Grace as he might.  They\ndecided the question for him.  He sat down and wrote a formal note to\nMelbury, in which he briefly stated that he was placed in such a\nposition as to make him share to the full Melbury's view of his own and\nhis daughter's promise, made some years before; to wish that it should\nbe considered as cancelled, and they themselves quite released from any\nobligation on account of it.\n\nHaving fastened up this their plenary absolution, he determined to get\nit out of his hands and have done with it; to which end he went off to\nMelbury's at once.  It was now so late that the family had all retired;\nhe crept up to the house, thrust the note under the door, and stole\naway as silently as he had come.\n\nMelbury himself was the first to rise the next morning, and when he had\nread the letter his relief was great.  \"Very honorable of Giles, very\nhonorable,\" he kept saying to himself.  \"I shall not forget him.  Now\nto keep her up to her own true level.\"\n\nIt happened that Grace went out for an early ramble that morning,\npassing through the door and gate while her father was in the\nspar-house.  To go in her customary direction she could not avoid\npassing Winterborne's house.  The morning sun was shining flat upon its\nwhite surface, and the words, which still remained, were immediately\nvisible to her.  She read them.  Her face flushed to crimson.  She\ncould see Giles and Creedle talking together at the back; the charred\nspar-gad with which the lines had been written lay on the ground\nbeneath the wall.  Feeling pretty sure that Winterborne would observe\nher action, she quickly went up to the wall, rubbed out \"lose\" and\ninserted \"keep\" in its stead.  Then she made the best of her way home\nwithout looking behind her. Giles could draw an inference now if he\nchose.\n\nThere could not be the least doubt that gentle Grace was warming to\nmore sympathy with, and interest in, Giles Winterborne than ever she\nhad done while he was her promised lover; that since his misfortune\nthose social shortcomings of his, which contrasted so awkwardly with\nher later experiences of life, had become obscured by the generous\nrevival of an old romantic attachment to him. Though mentally trained\nand tilled into foreignness of view, as compared with her youthful\ntime, Grace was not an ambitious girl, and might, if left to herself,\nhave declined Winterborne without much discontent or unhappiness.  Her\nfeelings just now were so far from latent that the writing on the wall\nhad thus quickened her to an unusual rashness.\n\nHaving returned from her walk she sat at breakfast silently.  When her\nstep-mother had left the room she said to her father, \"I have made up\nmy mind that I should like my engagement to Giles to continue, for the\npresent at any rate, till I can see further what I ought to do.\"\n\nMelbury looked much surprised.\n\n\"Nonsense,\" he said, sharply.  \"You don't know what you are talking\nabout.  Look here.\"\n\nHe handed across to her the letter received from Giles.\n\nShe read it, and said no more.  Could he have seen her write on the\nwall?  She did not know.  Fate, it seemed, would have it this way, and\nthere was nothing to do but to acquiesce.\n\nIt was a few hours after this that Winterborne, who, curiously enough,\nhad NOT perceived Grace writing, was clearing away the tree from the\nfront of South's late dwelling.  He saw Marty standing in her door-way,\na slim figure in meagre black, almost without womanly contours as yet.\nHe went up to her and said, \"Marty, why did you write that on my wall\nlast night?  It WAS you, you know.\"\n\n\"Because it was the truth.  I didn't mean to let it stay, Mr.\nWinterborne; but when I was going to rub it out you came, and I was\nobliged to run off.\"\n\n\"Having prophesied one thing, why did you alter it to another? Your\npredictions can't be worth much.\"\n\n\"I have not altered it.\"\n\n\"But you have.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"It is altered.  Go and see.\"\n\nShe went, and read that, in spite of losing his dwelling-place, he\nwould KEEP his Grace.  Marty came back surprised.\n\n\"Well, I never,\" she said.  \"Who can have made such nonsense of it?\"\n\n\"Who, indeed?\" said he.\n\n\"I have rubbed it all out, as the point of it is quite gone.\"\n\n\"You'd no business to rub it out.  I didn't tell you to.  I meant to\nlet it stay a little longer.\"\n\n\"Some idle boy did it, no doubt,\" she murmured.\n\nAs this seemed very probable, and the actual perpetrator was\nunsuspected, Winterborne said no more, and dismissed the matter from\nhis mind.\n\nFrom this day of his life onward for a considerable time, Winterborne,\nthough not absolutely out of his house as yet, retired into the\nbackground of human life and action thereabout--a feat not particularly\ndifficult of performance anywhere when the doer has the assistance of a\nlost prestige.  Grace, thinking that Winterborne saw her write, made no\nfurther sign, and the frail bark of fidelity that she had thus timidly\nlaunched was stranded and lost.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nDr. Fitzpiers lived on the slope of the hill, in a house of much less\npretension, both as to architecture and as to magnitude, than the\ntimber-merchant's.  The latter had, without doubt, been once the\nmanorial residence appertaining to the snug and modest domain of Little\nHintock, of which the boundaries were now lost by its absorption with\nothers of its kind into the adjoining estate of Mrs. Charmond.  Though\nthe Melburys themselves were unaware of the fact, there was every\nreason to believe--at least so the parson said--that the owners of that\nlittle manor had been Melbury's own ancestors, the family name\noccurring in numerous documents relating to transfers of land about the\ntime of the civil wars.\n\nMr. Fitzpiers's dwelling, on the contrary, was small, cottage-like, and\ncomparatively modern.  It had been occupied, and was in part occupied\nstill, by a retired farmer and his wife, who, on the surgeon's arrival\nin quest of a home, had accommodated him by receding from their front\nrooms into the kitchen quarter, whence they administered to his wants,\nand emerged at regular intervals to receive from him a not unwelcome\naddition to their income.\n\nThe cottage and its garden were so regular in their arrangement that\nthey might have been laid out by a Dutch designer of the time of\nWilliam and Mary.  In a low, dense hedge, cut to wedge-shape, was a\ndoor over which the hedge formed an arch, and from the inside of the\ndoor a straight path, bordered with clipped box, ran up the slope of\nthe garden to the porch, which was exactly in the middle of the house\nfront, with two windows on each side.  Right and left of the path were\nfirst a bed of gooseberry bushes; next of currant; next of raspberry;\nnext of strawberry; next of old-fashioned flowers; at the corners\nopposite the porch being spheres of box resembling a pair of school\nglobes.  Over the roof of the house could be seen the orchard, on yet\nhigher ground, and behind the orchard the forest-trees, reaching up to\nthe crest of the hill.\n\nOpposite the garden door and visible from the parlor window was a\nswing-gate leading into a field, across which there ran a footpath.\nThe swing-gate had just been repainted, and on one fine afternoon,\nbefore the paint was dry, and while gnats were still dying thereon, the\nsurgeon was standing in his sitting-room abstractedly looking out at\nthe different pedestrians who passed and repassed along that route.\nBeing of a philosophical stamp, he perceived that the character of each\nof these travellers exhibited itself in a somewhat amusing manner by\nhis or her method of handling the gate.\n\nAs regarded the men, there was not much variety: they gave the gate a\nkick and passed through.  The women were more contrasting. To them the\nsticky wood-work was a barricade, a disgust, a menace, a treachery, as\nthe case might be.\n\nThe first that he noticed was a bouncing woman with her skirts tucked\nup and her hair uncombed.  She grasped the gate without looking, giving\nit a supplementary push with her shoulder, when the white imprint drew\nfrom her an exclamation in language not too refined.  She went to the\ngreen bank, sat down and rubbed herself in the grass, cursing the while.\n\n\"Ha! ha! ha!\" laughed the doctor.\n\nThe next was a girl, with her hair cropped short, in whom the surgeon\nrecognized the daughter of his late patient, the woodman South.\nMoreover, a black bonnet that she wore by way of mourning unpleasantly\nreminded him that he had ordered the felling of a tree which had caused\nher parent's death and Winterborne's losses. She walked and thought,\nand not recklessly; but her preoccupation led her to grasp\nunsuspectingly the bar of the gate, and touch it with her arm.\nFitzpiers felt sorry that she should have soiled that new black frock,\npoor as it was, for it was probably her only one.  She looked at her\nhand and arm, seemed but little surprised, wiped off the disfigurement\nwith an almost unmoved face, and as if without abandoning her original\nthoughts.  Thus she went on her way.\n\nThen there came over the green quite a different sort of personage.\nShe walked as delicately as if she had been bred in town, and as firmly\nas if she had been bred in the country; she seemed one who dimly knew\nher appearance to be attractive, but who retained some of the charm of\nbeing ignorant of that fact by forgetting it in a general pensiveness.\nShe approached the gate. To let such a creature touch it even with a\ntip of her glove was to Fitzpiers almost like letting her proceed to\ntragical self-destruction.  He jumped up and looked for his hat, but\nwas unable to find the right one; glancing again out of the window he\nsaw that he was too late.  Having come up, she stopped, looked at the\ngate, picked up a little stick, and using it as a bayonet, pushed open\nthe obstacle without touching it at all.\n\nHe steadily watched her till she had passed out of sight, recognizing\nher as the very young lady whom he had seen once before and been unable\nto identify.  Whose could that emotional face be? All the others he had\nseen in Hintock as yet oppressed him with their crude rusticity; the\ncontrast offered by this suggested that she hailed from elsewhere.\n\nPrecisely these thoughts had occurred to him at the first time of\nseeing her; but he now went a little further with them, and considered\nthat as there had been no carriage seen or heard lately in that spot\nshe could not have come a very long distance.  She must be somebody\nstaying at Hintock House? Possibly Mrs. Charmond, of whom he had heard\nso much--at any rate an inmate, and this probability was sufficient to\nset a mild radiance in the surgeon's somewhat dull sky.\n\nFitzpiers sat down to the book he had been perusing.  It happened to be\nthat of a German metaphysician, for the doctor was not a practical man,\nexcept by fits, and much preferred the ideal world to the real, and the\ndiscovery of principles to their application. The young lady remained\nin his thoughts.  He might have followed her; but he was not\nconstitutionally active, and preferred a conjectural pursuit.  However,\nwhen he went out for a ramble just before dusk he insensibly took the\ndirection of Hintock House, which was the way that Grace had been\nwalking, it having happened that her mind had run on Mrs. Charmond that\nday, and she had walked to the brow of a hill whence the house could be\nseen, returning by another route.\n\nFitzpiers in his turn reached the edge of the glen, overlooking the\nmanor-house.  The shutters were shut, and only one chimney smoked.  The\nmere aspect of the place was enough to inform him that Mrs. Charmond\nhad gone away and that nobody else was staying there.  Fitzpiers felt a\nvague disappointment that the young lady was not Mrs. Charmond, of whom\nhe had heard so much; and without pausing longer to gaze at a carcass\nfrom which the spirit had flown, he bent his steps homeward.\n\nLater in the evening Fitzpiers was summoned to visit a cottage patient\nabout two miles distant.  Like the majority of young practitioners in\nhis position he was far from having assumed the dignity of being driven\nhis rounds by a servant in a brougham that flashed the sunlight like a\nmirror; his way of getting about was by means of a gig which he drove\nhimself, hitching the rein of the horse to the gate post, shutter hook,\nor garden paling of the domicile under visitation, or giving pennies to\nlittle boys to hold the animal during his stay--pennies which were well\nearned when the cases to be attended were of a certain cheerful kind\nthat wore out the patience of the little boys.\n\nOn this account of travelling alone, the night journeys which Fitzpiers\nhad frequently to take were dismal enough, a serious apparent\nperversity in nature ruling that whenever there was to be a birth in a\nparticularly inaccessible and lonely place, that event should occur in\nthe night.  The surgeon, having been of late years a town man, hated\nthe solitary midnight woodland.  He was not altogether skilful with the\nreins, and it often occurred to his mind that if in some remote depths\nof the trees an accident were to happen, the fact of his being alone\nmight be the death of him.  Hence he made a practice of picking up any\ncountryman or lad whom he chanced to pass by, and under the disguise of\ntreating him to a nice drive, obtained his companionship on the\njourney, and his convenient assistance in opening gates.\n\nThe doctor had started on his way out of the village on the night in\nquestion when the light of his lamps fell upon the musing form of\nWinterborne, walking leisurely along, as if he had no object in life.\nWinterborne was a better class of companion than the doctor usually\ncould get, and he at once pulled up and asked him if he would like a\ndrive through the wood that fine night.\n\nGiles seemed rather surprised at the doctor's friendliness, but said\nthat he had no objection, and accordingly mounted beside Mr. Fitzpiers.\n\nThey drove along under the black boughs which formed a network upon the\nstars, all the trees of a species alike in one respect, and no two of\nthem alike in another.  Looking up as they passed under a horizontal\nbough they sometimes saw objects like large tadpoles lodged\ndiametrically across it, which Giles explained to be pheasants there at\nroost; and they sometimes heard the report of a gun, which reminded him\nthat others knew what those tadpole shapes represented as well as he.\n\nPresently the doctor said what he had been going to say for some time:\n\n\"Is there a young lady staying in this neighborhood--a very attractive\ngirl--with a little white boa round her neck, and white fur round her\ngloves?\"\n\nWinterborne of course knew in a moment that Grace, whom he had caught\nthe doctor peering at, was represented by these accessaries.  With a\nwary grimness, partly in his character, partly induced by the\ncircumstances, he evaded an answer by saying, \"I saw a young lady\ntalking to Mrs. Charmond the other day; perhaps it was she.\"\n\nFitzpiers concluded from this that Winterborne had not seen him looking\nover the hedge.  \"It might have been,\" he said.  \"She is quite a\ngentlewoman--the one I mean.  She cannot be a permanent resident in\nHintock or I should have seen her before.  Nor does she look like one.\"\n\n\"She is not staying at Hintock House?\"\n\n\"No; it is closed.\"\n\n\"Then perhaps she is staying at one of the cottages, or farmhouses?\"\n\n\"Oh no--you mistake.  She was a different sort of girl altogether.\" As\nGiles was nobody, Fitzpiers treated him accordingly, and apostrophized\nthe night in continuation:\n\n  \"'She moved upon this earth a shape of brightness,\n    A power, that from its objects scarcely drew\n    One impulse of her being--in her lightness\n    Most like some radiant cloud of morning dew,\n    Which wanders through the waste air's pathless blue,\n    To nourish some far desert: she did seem\n    Beside me, gathering beauty as she grew,\n    Like the bright shade of some immortal dream\n    Which walks, when tempests sleep, the wave of life's dark stream.'\"\n\n\nThe consummate charm of the lines seemed to Winterborne, though he\ndivined that they were a quotation, to be somehow the result of his\nlost love's charms upon Fitzpiers.\n\n\"You seem to be mightily in love with her, sir,\" he said, with a\nsensation of heart-sickness, and more than ever resolved not to mention\nGrace by name.\n\n\"Oh no--I am not that, Winterborne; people living insulated, as I do by\nthe solitude of this place, get charged with emotive fluid like a\nLeyden-jar with electric, for want of some conductor at hand to\ndisperse it.  Human love is a subjective thing--the essence itself of\nman, as that great thinker Spinoza the philosopher says--ipsa hominis\nessentia--it is joy accompanied by an idea which we project against any\nsuitable object in the line of our vision, just as the rainbow iris is\nprojected against an oak, ash, or elm tree indifferently.  So that if\nany other young lady had appeared instead of the one who did appear, I\nshould have felt just the same interest in her, and have quoted\nprecisely the same lines from Shelley about her, as about this one I\nsaw.  Such miserable creatures of circumstance are we all!\"\n\n\"Well, it is what we call being in love down in these parts, whether or\nno,\" said Winterborne.\n\n\"You are right enough if you admit that I am in love with something in\nmy own head, and no thing in itself outside it at all.\"\n\n\"Is it part of a country doctor's duties to learn that view of things,\nmay I ask, sir?\" said Winterborne, adopting the Socratic {Greek word:\nirony} with such well-assumed simplicity that Fitzpiers answered,\nreadily,\n\n\"Oh no.  The real truth is, Winterborne, that medical practice in\nplaces like this is a very rule-of-thumb matter; a bottle of bitter\nstuff for this and that old woman--the bitterer the better--compounded\nfrom a few simple stereotyped prescriptions; occasional attendance at\nbirths, where mere presence is almost sufficient, so healthy and strong\nare the people; and a lance for an abscess now and then.  Investigation\nand experiment cannot be carried on without more appliances than one\nhas here--though I have attempted it a little.\"\n\nGiles did not enter into this view of the case; what he had been struck\nwith was the curious parallelism between Mr. Fitzpiers's manner and\nGrace's, as shown by the fact of both of them straying into a subject\nof discourse so engrossing to themselves that it made them forget it\nwas foreign to him.\n\nNothing further passed between himself and the doctor in relation to\nGrace till they were on their way back.  They had stopped at a way-side\ninn for a glass of brandy and cider hot, and when they were again in\nmotion, Fitzpiers, possibly a little warmed by the liquor, resumed the\nsubject by saying, \"I should like very much to know who that young lady\nwas.\"\n\n\"What difference can it make, if she's only the tree your rainbow falls\non?\"\n\n\"Ha! ha! True.\"\n\n\"You have no wife, sir?\"\n\n\"I have no wife, and no idea of one.  I hope to do better things than\nmarry and settle in Hintock.  Not but that it is well for a medical man\nto be married, and sometimes, begad, 'twould be pleasant enough in this\nplace, with the wind roaring round the house, and the rain and the\nboughs beating against it.  I hear that you lost your life-holds by the\ndeath of South?\"\n\n\"I did.  I lost in more ways than one.\"\n\nThey had reached the top of Hintock Lane or Street, if it could be\ncalled such where three-quarters of the road-side consisted of copse\nand orchard.  One of the first houses to be passed was Melbury's.  A\nlight was shining from a bedroom window facing lengthwise of the lane.\nWinterborne glanced at it, and saw what was coming.  He had withheld an\nanswer to the doctor's inquiry to hinder his knowledge of Grace; but,\nas he thought to himself, \"who hath gathered the wind in his fists? who\nhath bound the waters in a garment?\" he could not hinder what was\ndoomed to arrive, and might just as well have been outspoken.  As they\ncame up to the house, Grace's figure was distinctly visible, drawing\nthe two white curtains together which were used here instead of blinds.\n\n\"Why, there she is!\" said Fitzpiers.  \"How does she come there?\"\n\n\"In the most natural way in the world.  It is her home.  Mr. Melbury is\nher father.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed--indeed--indeed!  How comes he to have a daughter of that\nstamp?\"\n\nWinterborne laughed coldly.  \"Won't money do anything,\" he said, \"if\nyou've promising material to work upon? Why shouldn't a Hintock girl,\ntaken early from home, and put under proper instruction, become as\nfinished as any other young lady, if she's got brains and good looks to\nbegin with?\"\n\n\"No reason at all why she shouldn't,\" murmured the surgeon, with\nreflective disappointment.  \"Only I didn't anticipate quite that kind\nof origin for her.\"\n\n\"And you think an inch or two less of her now.\" There was a little\ntremor in Winterborne's voice as he spoke.\n\n\"Well,\" said the doctor, with recovered warmth, \"I am not so sure that\nI think less of her.  At first it was a sort of blow; but, dammy! I'll\nstick up for her.  She's charming, every inch of her!\"\n\n\"So she is,\" said Winterborne, \"but not to me.\"\n\nFrom this ambiguous expression of the reticent woodlander's, Dr.\nFitzpiers inferred that Giles disliked Miss Melbury because of some\nhaughtiness in her bearing towards him, and had, on that account,\nwithheld her name.  The supposition did not tend to diminish his\nadmiration for her.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\nGrace's exhibition of herself, in the act of pulling-to the\nwindow-curtains, had been the result of an unfortunate incident in the\nhouse that day--nothing less than the illness of Grammer Oliver, a\nwoman who had never till now lain down for such a reason in her life.\nLike others to whom unbroken years of health has made the idea of\nkeeping their bed almost as repugnant as death itself, she had\ncontinued on foot till she literally fell on the floor; and though she\nhad, as yet, been scarcely a day off duty, she had sickened into quite\na different personage from the independent Grammer of the yard and\nspar-house.  Ill as she was, on one point she was firm.  On no account\nwould she see a doctor; in other words, Fitzpiers.\n\nThe room in which Grace had been discerned was not her own, but the old\nwoman's.  On the girl's way to bed she had received a message from\nGrammer, to the effect that she would much like to speak to her that\nnight.\n\nGrace entered, and set the candle on a low chair beside the bed, so\nthat the profile of Grammer as she lay cast itself in a keen shadow\nupon the whitened wall, her large head being still further magnified by\nan enormous turban, which was, really, her petticoat wound in a wreath\nround her temples.  Grace put the room a little in order, and\napproaching the sick woman, said, \"I am come, Grammer, as you wish.  Do\nlet us send for the doctor before it gets later.\"\n\n\"I will not have him,\" said Grammer Oliver, decisively.\n\n\"Then somebody to sit up with you.\"\n\n\"Can't abear it! No; I wanted to see you, Miss Grace, because 'ch have\nsomething on my mind.  Dear Miss Grace, I TOOK THAT MONEY OF THE\nDOCTOR, AFTER ALL!\"\n\n\"What money?\"\n\n\"The ten pounds.\"\n\nGrace did not quite understand.\n\n\"The ten pounds he offered me for my head, because I've a large brain.\nI signed a paper when I took the money, not feeling concerned about it\nat all.  I have not liked to tell ye that it was really settled with\nhim, because you showed such horror at the notion.  Well, having\nthought it over more at length, I wish I hadn't done it; and it weighs\nupon my mind.  John South's death of fear about the tree makes me think\nthat I shall die of this....'Ch have been going to ask him again to let\nme off, but I hadn't the face.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"I've spent some of the money--more'n two pounds o't.  It do wherrit me\nterribly; and I shall die o' the thought of that paper I signed with my\nholy cross, as South died of his trouble.\"\n\n \"If you ask him to burn the paper he will, I'm sure, and think no\nmore of it.\"\n\n \"'Ch have done it once already, miss.  But he laughed cruel like.\n'Yours is such a fine brain, Grammer,' 'er said, 'that science couldn't\nafford to lose you.  Besides, you've taken my money.'...Don't let your\nfather know of this, please, on no account whatever!\"\n\n\"No, no.  I will let you have the money to return to him.\"\n\nGrammer rolled her head negatively upon the pillow. \"Even if I should\nbe well enough to take it to him, he won't like it.  Though why he\nshould so particular want to look into the works of a poor old woman's\nhead-piece like mine when there's so many other folks about, I don't\nknow.  I know how he'll answer me: 'A lonely person like you, Grammer,'\ner woll say.  'What difference is it to you what becomes of ye when the\nbreath's out of your body?' Oh, it do trouble me! If you only knew how\nhe do chevy me round the chimmer in my dreams, you'd pity me.  How I\ncould do it I can't think! But 'ch was always so rackless!...If I only\nhad anybody to plead for me!\"\n\n\"Mrs. Melbury would, I am sure.\"\n\n\"Ay; but he wouldn't hearken to she! It wants a younger face than hers\nto work upon such as he.\"\n\nGrace started with comprehension.  \"You don't think he would do it for\nme?\" she said.\n\n\"Oh, wouldn't he!\"\n\n\"I couldn't go to him, Grammer, on any account.  I don't know him at\nall.\"\n\n\"Ah, if I were a young lady,\" said the artful Grammer, \"and could save\na poor old woman's skellington from a heathen doctor instead of a\nChristian grave, I would do it, and be glad to.  But nobody will do\nanything for a poor old familiar friend but push her out of the way.\"\n\n\"You are very ungrateful, Grammer, to say that.  But you are ill, I\nknow, and that's why you speak so.  Now believe me, you are not going\nto die yet.  Remember you told me yourself that you meant to keep him\nwaiting many a year.\"\n\n\"Ay, one can joke when one is well, even in old age; but in sickness\none's gayety falters to grief; and that which seemed small looks large;\nand the grim far-off seems near.\"\n\nGrace's eyes had tears in them.  \"I don't like to go to him on such an\nerrand, Grammer,\" she said, brokenly.  \"But I will, to ease your mind.\"\n\nIt was with extreme reluctance that Grace cloaked herself next morning\nfor the undertaking.  She was all the more indisposed to the journey by\nreason of Grammer's allusion to the effect of a pretty face upon Dr.\nFitzpiers; and hence she most illogically did that which, had the\ndoctor never seen her, would have operated to stultify the sole motive\nof her journey; that is to say, she put on a woollen veil, which hid\nall her face except an occasional spark of her eyes.\n\nHer own wish that nothing should be known of this strange and grewsome\nproceeding, no less than Grammer Oliver's own desire, led Grace to take\nevery precaution against being discovered.  She went out by the garden\ndoor as the safest way, all the household having occupations at the\nother side.  The morning looked forbidding enough when she stealthily\nopened it.  The battle between frost and thaw was continuing in\nmid-air: the trees dripped on the garden-plots, where no vegetables\nwould grow for the dripping, though they were planted year after year\nwith that curious mechanical regularity of country people in the face\nof hopelessness; the moss which covered the once broad gravel terrace\nwas swamped; and Grace stood irresolute.  Then she thought of poor\nGrammer, and her dreams of the doctor running after her, scalpel in\nhand, and the possibility of a case so curiously similar to South's\nending in the same way; thereupon she stepped out into the drizzle.\n\nThe nature of her errand, and Grammer Oliver's account of the compact\nshe had made, lent a fascinating horror to Grace's conception of\nFitzpiers.  She knew that he was a young man; but her single object in\nseeking an interview with him put all considerations of his age and\nsocial aspect from her mind. Standing as she stood, in Grammer Oliver's\nshoes, he was simply a remorseless Jove of the sciences, who would not\nhave mercy, and would have sacrifice; a man whom, save for this, she\nwould have preferred to avoid knowing.  But since, in such a small\nvillage, it was improbable that any long time could pass without their\nmeeting, there was not much to deplore in her having to meet him now.\n\nBut, as need hardly be said, Miss Melbury's view of the doctor as a\nmerciless, unwavering, irresistible scientist was not quite in\naccordance with fact.  The real Dr. Fitzpiers was a man of too many\nhobbies to show likelihood of rising to any great eminence in the\nprofession he had chosen, or even to acquire any wide practice in the\nrural district he had marked out as his field of survey for the\npresent.  In the course of a year his mind was accustomed to pass in a\ngrand solar sweep through all the zodiacal signs of the intellectual\nheaven.  Sometimes it was in the Ram, sometimes in the Bull; one month\nhe would be immersed in alchemy, another in poesy; one month in the\nTwins of astrology and astronomy; then in the Crab of German literature\nand metaphysics.  In justice to him it must be stated that he took such\nstudies as were immediately related to his own profession in turn with\nthe rest, and it had been in a month of anatomical ardor without the\npossibility of a subject that he had proposed to Grammer Oliver the\nterms she had mentioned to her mistress.\n\nAs may be inferred from the tone of his conversation with Winterborne,\nhe had lately plunged into abstract philosophy with much zest; perhaps\nhis keenly appreciative, modern, unpractical mind found this a realm\nmore to his taste than any other.  Though his aims were desultory,\nFitzpiers's mental constitution was not without its admirable side; a\nkeen inquirer he honestly was, even if the midnight rays of his lamp,\nvisible so far through the trees of Hintock, lighted rank literatures\nof emotion and passion as often as, or oftener than, the books and\nmateriel of science.\n\nBut whether he meditated the Muses or the philosophers, the loneliness\nof Hintock life was beginning to tell upon his impressionable nature.\nWinter in a solitary house in the country, without society, is\ntolerable, nay, even enjoyable and delightful, given certain\nconditions, but these are not the conditions which attach to the life\nof a professional man who drops down into such a place by mere\naccident.  They were present to the lives of Winterborne, Melbury, and\nGrace; but not to the doctor's.  They are old association--an almost\nexhaustive biographical or historical acquaintance with every object,\nanimate and inanimate, within the observer's horizon.  He must know all\nabout those invisible ones of the days gone by, whose feet have\ntraversed the fields which look so gray from his windows; recall whose\ncreaking plough has turned those sods from time to time; whose hands\nplanted the trees that form a crest to the opposite hill; whose horses\nand hounds have torn through that underwood; what birds affect that\nparticular brake; what domestic dramas of love, jealousy, revenge, or\ndisappointment have been enacted in the cottages, the mansion, the\nstreet, or on the green.  The spot may have beauty, grandeur,\nsalubrity, convenience; but if it lack memories it will ultimately pall\nupon him who settles there without opportunity of intercourse with his\nkind.\n\nIn such circumstances, maybe, an old man dreams of an ideal friend,\ntill he throws himself into the arms of any impostor who chooses to\nwear that title on his face.  A young man may dream of an ideal friend\nlikewise, but some humor of the blood will probably lead him to think\nrather of an ideal mistress, and at length the rustle of a woman's\ndress, the sound of her voice, or the transit of her form across the\nfield of his vision, will enkindle his soul with a flame that blinds\nhis eyes.\n\nThe discovery of the attractive Grace's name and family would have been\nenough in other circumstances to lead the doctor, if not to put her\npersonality out of his head, to change the character of his interest in\nher.  Instead of treasuring her image as a rarity, he would at most\nhave played with it as a toy.  He was that kind of a man.  But situated\nhere he could not go so far as amative cruelty.  He dismissed all\nreverential thought about her, but he could not help taking her\nseriously.\n\nHe went on to imagine the impossible.  So far, indeed, did he go in\nthis futile direction that, as others are wont to do, he constructed\ndialogues and scenes in which Grace had turned out to be the mistress\nof Hintock Manor-house, the mysterious Mrs. Charmond, particularly\nready and willing to be wooed by himself and nobody else.  \"Well, she\nisn't that,\" he said, finally.  \"But she's a very sweet, nice,\nexceptional girl.\"\n\nThe next morning he breakfasted alone, as usual.  It was snowing with a\nfine-flaked desultoriness just sufficient to make the woodland gray,\nwithout ever achieving whiteness.  There was not a single letter for\nFitzpiers, only a medical circular and a weekly newspaper.\n\nTo sit before a large fire on such mornings, and read, and gradually\nacquire energy till the evening came, and then, with lamp alight, and\nfeeling full of vigor, to pursue some engrossing subject or other till\nthe small hours, had hitherto been his practice.  But to-day he could\nnot settle into his chair.  That self-contained position he had lately\noccupied, in which the only attention demanded was the concentration of\nthe inner eye, all outer regard being quite gratuitous, seemed to have\nbeen taken by insidious stratagem, and for the first time he had an\ninterest outside the house.  He walked from one window to another, and\nbecame aware that the most irksome of solitudes is not the solitude of\nremoteness, but that which is just outside desirable company.\n\nThe breakfast hour went by heavily enough, and the next followed, in\nthe same half-snowy, half-rainy style, the weather now being the\ninevitable relapse which sooner or later succeeds a time too radiant\nfor the season, such as they had enjoyed in the late midwinter at\nHintock.  To people at home there these changeful tricks had their\ninterests; the strange mistakes that some of the more sanguine trees\nhad made in budding before their month, to be incontinently glued up by\nfrozen thawings now; the similar sanguine errors of impulsive birds in\nframing nests that were now swamped by snow-water, and other such\nincidents, prevented any sense of wearisomeness in the minds of the\nnatives.  But these were features of a world not familiar to Fitzpiers,\nand the inner visions to which he had almost exclusively attended\nhaving suddenly failed in their power to absorb him, he felt\nunutterably dreary.\n\nHe wondered how long Miss Melbury was going to stay in Hintock. The\nseason was unpropitious for accidental encounters with her\nout-of-doors, and except by accident he saw not how they were to become\nacquainted.  One thing was clear--any acquaintance with her could only,\nwith a due regard to his future, be casual, at most of the nature of a\nflirtation; for he had high aims, and they would some day lead him into\nother spheres than this.\n\nThus desultorily thinking he flung himself down upon the couch, which,\nas in many draughty old country houses, was constructed with a hood,\nbeing in fact a legitimate development from the settle.  He tried to\nread as he reclined, but having sat up till three o'clock that morning,\nthe book slipped from his hand and he fell asleep.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nIt was at this time that Grace approached the house.  Her knock, always\nsoft in virtue of her nature, was softer to-day by reason of her\nstrange errand.  However, it was heard by the farmer's wife who kept\nthe house, and Grace was admitted.  Opening the door of the doctor's\nroom the housewife glanced in, and imagining Fitzpiers absent, asked\nMiss Melbury to enter and wait a few minutes while she should go and\nfind him, believing him to be somewhere on the premises.  Grace\nacquiesced, went in, and sat down close to the door.\n\nAs soon as the door was shut upon her she looked round the room, and\nstarted at perceiving a handsome man snugly ensconced in the couch,\nlike the recumbent figure within some canopied mural tomb of the\nfifteenth century, except that his hands were by no means clasped in\nprayer.  She had no doubt that this was the doctor. Awaken him herself\nshe could not, and her immediate impulse was to go and pull the broad\nribbon with a brass rosette which hung at one side of the fireplace.\nBut expecting the landlady to re-enter in a moment she abandoned this\nintention, and stood gazing in great embarrassment at the reclining\nphilosopher.\n\nThe windows of Fitzpiers's soul being at present shuttered, he probably\nappeared less impressive than in his hours of animation; but the light\nabstracted from his material presence by sleep was more than\ncounterbalanced by the mysterious influence of that state, in a\nstranger, upon the consciousness of a beholder so sensitive.  So far as\nshe could criticise at all, she became aware that she had encountered a\nspecimen of creation altogether unusual in that locality.  The\noccasions on which Grace had observed men of this stamp were when she\nhad been far removed away from Hintock, and even then such examples as\nhad met her eye were at a distance, and mainly of coarser fibre than\nthe one who now confronted her.\n\nShe nervously wondered why the woman had not discovered her mistake and\nreturned, and went again towards the bell-pull. Approaching the chimney\nher back was to Fitzpiers, but she could see him in the glass.  An\nindescribable thrill passed through her as she perceived that the eyes\nof the reflected image were open, gazing wonderingly at her, and under\nthe curious unexpectedness of the sight she became as if spellbound,\nalmost powerless to turn her head and regard the original.  However, by\nan effort she did turn, when there he lay asleep the same as before.\n\nHer startled perplexity as to what he could be meaning was sufficient\nto lead her to precipitately abandon her errand.  She crossed quickly\nto the door, opened and closed it noiselessly, and went out of the\nhouse unobserved.  By the time that she had gone down the path and\nthrough the garden door into the lane she had recovered her equanimity.\nHere, screened by the hedge, she stood and considered a while.\n\nDrip, drip, drip, fell the rain upon her umbrella and around; she had\ncome out on such a morning because of the seriousness of the matter in\nhand; yet now she had allowed her mission to be stultified by a\nmomentary tremulousness concerning an incident which perhaps had meant\nnothing after all.\n\nIn the mean time her departure from the room, stealthy as it had been,\nhad roused Fitzpiers, and he sat up.  In the reflection from the mirror\nwhich Grace had beheld there was no mystery; he had opened his eyes for\na few moments, but had immediately relapsed into unconsciousness, if,\nindeed, he had ever been positively awake.  That somebody had just left\nthe room he was certain, and that the lovely form which seemed to have\nvisited him in a dream was no less than the real presentation of the\nperson departed he could hardly doubt.\n\nLooking out of the window a few minutes later, down the box-edged\ngravel-path which led to the bottom, he saw the garden door gently\nopen, and through it enter the young girl of his thoughts, Grace having\njust at this juncture determined to return and attempt the interview a\nsecond time.  That he saw her coming instead of going made him ask\nhimself if his first impression of her were not a dream indeed.  She\ncame hesitatingly along, carrying her umbrella so low over her head\nthat he could hardly see her face.  When she reached the point where\nthe raspberry bushes ended and the strawberry bed began, she made a\nlittle pause.\n\nFitzpiers feared that she might not be coming to him even now, and\nhastily quitting the room, he ran down the path to meet her.  The\nnature of her errand he could not divine, but he was prepared to give\nher any amount of encouragement.\n\n\"I beg pardon, Miss Melbury,\" he said.  \"I saw you from the window, and\nfancied you might imagine that I was not at home--if it is I you were\ncoming for.\"\n\n\"I was coming to speak one word to you, nothing more,\" she replied.\n\"And I can say it here.\"\n\n\"No, no.  Please do come in.  Well, then, if you will not come into the\nhouse, come as far as the porch.\"\n\nThus pressed she went on to the porch, and they stood together inside\nit, Fitzpiers closing her umbrella for her.\n\n\"I have merely a request or petition to make,\" she said.  \"My father's\nservant is ill--a woman you know--and her illness is serious.\"\n\n\"I am sorry to hear it.  You wish me to come and see her at once?\"\n\n\"No; I particularly wish you not to come.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed.\"\n\n\"Yes; and she wishes the same.  It would make her seriously worse if\nyou were to come.  It would almost kill her....My errand is of a\npeculiar and awkward nature.  It is concerning a subject which weighs\non her mind--that unfortunate arrangement she made with you, that you\nmight have her body--after death.\"\n\n\"Oh! Grammer Oliver, the old woman with the fine head.  Seriously ill,\nis she!\"\n\n\"And SO disturbed by her rash compact! I have brought the money\nback--will you please return to her the agreement she signed?\" Grace\nheld out to him a couple of five-pound notes which she had kept ready\ntucked in her glove.\n\nWithout replying or considering the notes, Fitzpiers allowed his\nthoughts to follow his eyes, and dwell upon Grace's personality, and\nthe sudden close relation in which he stood to her.  The porch was\nnarrow; the rain increased.  It ran off the porch and dripped on the\ncreepers, and from the creepers upon the edge of Grace's cloak and\nskirts.\n\n\"The rain is wetting your dress; please do come in,\" he said.  \"It\nreally makes my heart ache to let you stay here.\"\n\nImmediately inside the front door was the door of his sitting-room; he\nflung it open, and stood in a coaxing attitude.  Try how she would,\nGrace could not resist the supplicatory mandate written in the face and\nmanner of this man, and distressful resignation sat on her as she\nglided past him into the room--brushing his coat with her elbow by\nreason of the narrowness.\n\nHe followed her, shut the door--which she somehow had hoped he would\nleave open--and placing a chair for her, sat down.  The concern which\nGrace felt at the development of these commonplace incidents was, of\ncourse, mainly owing to the strange effect upon her nerves of that view\nof him in the mirror gazing at her with open eyes when she had thought\nhim sleeping, which made her fancy that his slumber might have been a\nfeint based on inexplicable reasons.\n\nShe again proffered the notes; he awoke from looking at her as at a\npiece of live statuary, and listened deferentially as she said, \"Will\nyou then reconsider, and cancel the bond which poor Grammer Oliver so\nfoolishly gave?\"\n\n\"I'll cancel it without reconsideration.  Though you will allow me to\nhave my own opinion about her foolishness.  Grammer is a very wise\nwoman, and she was as wise in that as in other things.  You think there\nwas something very fiendish in the compact, do you not, Miss Melbury?\nBut remember that the most eminent of our surgeons in past times have\nentered into such agreements.\"\n\n\"Not fiendish--strange.\"\n\n\"Yes, that may be, since strangeness is not in the nature of a thing,\nbut in its relation to something extrinsic--in this case an unessential\nobserver.\"\n\nHe went to his desk, and searching a while found a paper, which be\nunfolded and brought to her.  A thick cross appeared in ink at the\nbottom--evidently from the hand of Grammer.  Grace put the paper in her\npocket with a look of much relief.\n\nAs Fitzpiers did not take up the money (half of which had come from\nGrace's own purse), she pushed it a little nearer to him. \"No, no.  I\nshall not take it from the old woman,\" he said.  \"It is more strange\nthan the fact of a surgeon arranging to obtain a subject for dissection\nthat our acquaintance should be formed out of it.\"\n\n\"I am afraid you think me uncivil in showing my dislike to the notion.\nBut I did not mean to be.\"\n\n\"Oh no, no.\"  He looked at her, as he had done before, with puzzled\ninterest.  \"I cannot think, I cannot think,\" he murmured. \"Something\nbewilders me greatly.\"  He still reflected and hesitated.  \"Last night\nI sat up very late,\" he at last went on, \"and on that account I fell\ninto a little nap on that couch about half an hour ago.  And during my\nfew minutes of unconsciousness I dreamed--what do you think?--that you\nstood in the room.\"\n\nShould she tell? She merely blushed.\n\n\"You may imagine,\" Fitzpiers continued, now persuaded that it had,\nindeed, been a dream, \"that I should not have dreamed of you without\nconsiderable thinking about you first.\"\n\nHe could not be acting; of that she felt assured.\n\n\"I fancied in my vision that you stood there,\" he said, pointing to\nwhere she had paused.  \"I did not see you directly, but reflected in\nthe glass.  I thought, what a lovely creature! The design is for once\ncarried out.  Nature has at last recovered her lost union with the\nIdea! My thoughts ran in that direction because I had been reading the\nwork of a transcendental philosopher last night; and I dare say it was\nthe dose of Idealism that I received from it that made me scarcely able\nto distinguish between reality and fancy.  I almost wept when I awoke,\nand found that you had appeared to me in Time, but not in Space, alas!\"\n\nAt moments there was something theatrical in the delivery of\nFitzpiers's effusion; yet it would have been inexact to say that it was\nintrinsically theatrical.  It often happens that in situations of\nunrestraint, where there is no thought of the eye of criticism, real\nfeeling glides into a mode of manifestation not easily distinguishable\nfrom rodomontade.  A veneer of affectation overlies a bulk of truth,\nwith the evil consequence, if perceived, that the substance is\nestimated by the superficies, and the whole rejected.\n\nGrace, however, was no specialist in men's manners, and she admired the\nsentiment without thinking of the form.  And she was embarrassed:\n\"lovely creature\" made explanation awkward to her gentle modesty.\n\n\"But can it be,\" said he, suddenly, \"that you really were here?\"\n\n\"I have to confess that I have been in the room once before,\" faltered\nshe.  \"The woman showed me in, and went away to fetch you; but as she\ndid not return, I left.\"\n\n\"And you saw me asleep,\" he murmured, with the faintest show of\nhumiliation.\n\n\"Yes--IF you were asleep, and did not deceive me.\"\n\n\"Why do you say if?\"\n\n\"I saw your eyes open in the glass, but as they were closed when I\nlooked round upon you, I thought you were perhaps deceiving me.\n\n\"Never,\" said Fitzpiers, fervently--\"never could I deceive you.\"\n\nForeknowledge to the distance of a year or so in either of them might\nhave spoiled the effect of that pretty speech.  Never deceive her! But\nthey knew nothing, and the phrase had its day.\n\nGrace began now to be anxious to terminate the interview, but the\ncompelling power of Fitzpiers's atmosphere still held her there. She\nwas like an inexperienced actress who, having at last taken up her\nposition on the boards, and spoken her speeches, does not know how to\nmove off.  The thought of Grammer occurred to her.  \"I'll go at once\nand tell poor Grammer of your generosity,\" she said. \"It will relieve\nher at once.\"\n\n\"Grammer's a nervous disease, too--how singular!\" he answered,\naccompanying her to the door.  \"One moment; look at this--it is\nsomething which may interest you.\"\n\nHe had thrown open the door on the other side of the passage, and she\nsaw a microscope on the table of the confronting room.  \"Look into it,\nplease; you'll be interested,\" he repeated.\n\nShe applied her eye, and saw the usual circle of light patterned all\nover with a cellular tissue of some indescribable sort.  \"What do you\nthink that is?\" said Fitzpiers.\n\nShe did not know.\n\n\"That's a fragment of old John South's brain, which I am investigating.\"\n\nShe started back, not with aversion, but with wonder as to how it\nshould have got there.  Fitzpiers laughed.\n\n\"Here am I,\" he said, \"endeavoring to carry on simultaneously the study\nof physiology and transcendental philosophy, the material world and the\nideal, so as to discover if possible a point of contrast between them;\nand your finer sense is quite offended!\"\n\n\"Oh no, Mr. Fitzpiers,\" said Grace, earnestly.  \"It is not so at all.\nI know from seeing your light at night how deeply you meditate and\nwork.  Instead of condemning you for your studies, I admire you very\nmuch!\"\n\nHer face, upturned from the microscope, was so sweet, sincere, and\nself-forgetful in its aspect that the susceptible Fitzpiers more than\nwished to annihilate the lineal yard which separated it from his own.\nWhether anything of the kind showed in his eyes or not, Grace remained\nno longer at the microscope, but quickly went her way into the rain.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\nInstead of resuming his investigation of South's brain, which perhaps\nwas not so interesting under the microscope as might have been expected\nfrom the importance of that organ in life, Fitzpiers reclined and\nruminated on the interview.  Grace's curious susceptibility to his\npresence, though it was as if the currents of her life were disturbed\nrather than attracted by him, added a special interest to her general\ncharm.  Fitzpiers was in a distinct degree scientific, being ready and\nzealous to interrogate all physical manifestations, but primarily he\nwas an idealist.  He believed that behind the imperfect lay the\nperfect; that rare things were to be discovered amid a bulk of\ncommonplace; that results in a new and untried case might be different\nfrom those in other cases where the conditions had been precisely\nsimilar. Regarding his own personality as one of unbounded\npossibilities, because it was his own--notwithstanding that the factors\nof his life had worked out a sorry product for thousands--he saw\nnothing but what was regular in his discovery at Hintock of an\naltogether exceptional being of the other sex, who for nobody else\nwould have had any existence.\n\nOne habit of Fitzpiers's--commoner in dreamers of more advanced age\nthan in men of his years--was that of talking to himself.  He paced\nround his room with a selective tread upon the more prominent blooms of\nthe carpet, and murmured, \"This phenomenal girl will be the light of my\nlife while I am at Hintock; and the special beauty of the situation is\nthat our attitude and relations to each other will be purely spiritual.\nSocially we can never be intimate.  Anything like matrimonial\nintentions towards her, charming as she is, would be absurd.  They\nwould spoil the ethereal character of my regard.  And, indeed, I have\nother aims on the practical side of my life.\"\n\nFitzpiers bestowed a regulation thought on the advantageous marriage he\nwas bound to make with a woman of family as good as his own, and of\npurse much longer.  But as an object of contemplation for the present,\nas objective spirit rather than corporeal presence, Grace Melbury would\nserve to keep his soul alive, and to relieve the monotony of his days.\n\nHis first notion--acquired from the mere sight of her without\nconverse--that of an idle and vulgar flirtation with a\ntimber-merchant's pretty daughter, grated painfully upon him now that\nhe had found what Grace intrinsically was.  Personal intercourse with\nsuch as she could take no lower form than intellectual communion, and\nmutual explorations of the world of thought.  Since he could not call\nat her father's, having no practical views, cursory encounters in the\nlane, in the wood, coming and going to and from church, or in passing\nher dwelling, were what the acquaintance would have to feed on.\n\nSuch anticipated glimpses of her now and then realized themselves in\nthe event.  Rencounters of not more than a minute's duration,\nfrequently repeated, will build up mutual interest, even an intimacy,\nin a lonely place.  Theirs grew as imperceptibly as the tree-twigs\nbudded.  There never was a particular moment at which it could be said\nthey became friends; yet a delicate understanding now existed between\ntwo who in the winter had been strangers.\n\nSpring weather came on rather suddenly, the unsealing of buds that had\nlong been swollen accomplishing itself in the space of one warm night.\nThe rush of sap in the veins of the trees could almost be heard.  The\nflowers of late April took up a position unseen, and looked as if they\nhad been blooming a long while, though there had been no trace of them\nthe day before yesterday; birds began not to mind getting wet.  In-door\npeople said they had heard the nightingale, to which out-door people\nreplied contemptuously that they had heard him a fortnight before.\n\nThe young doctor's practice being scarcely so large as a London\nsurgeon's, he frequently walked in the wood.  Indeed such practice as\nhe had he did not follow up with the assiduity that would have been\nnecessary for developing it to exceptional proportions.  One day, book\nin hand, he walked in a part of the wood where the trees were mainly\noaks.  It was a calm afternoon, and there was everywhere around that\nsign of great undertakings on the part of vegetable nature which is apt\nto fill reflective human beings who are not undertaking much themselves\nwith a sudden uneasiness at the contrast.  He heard in the distance a\ncurious sound, something like the quack of a duck, which, though it was\ncommon enough here about this time, was not common to him.\n\nLooking through the trees Fitzpiers soon perceived the origin of the\nnoise.  The barking season had just commenced, and what he had heard\nwas the tear of the ripping tool as it ploughed its way along the\nsticky parting between the trunk and the rind.  Melbury did a large\nbusiness in bark, and as he was Grace's father, and possibly might be\nfound on the spot, Fitzpiers was attracted to the scene even more than\nhe might have been by its intrinsic interest.  When he got nearer he\nrecognized among the workmen the two Timothys, and Robert Creedle, who\nprobably had been \"lent\" by Winterborne; Marty South also assisted.\n\nEach tree doomed to this flaying process was first attacked by Creedle.\nWith a small billhook he carefully freed the collar of the tree from\ntwigs and patches of moss which incrusted it to a height of a foot or\ntwo above the ground, an operation comparable to the \"little toilet\" of\nthe executioner's victim.  After this it was barked in its erect\nposition to a point as high as a man could reach.  If a fine product of\nvegetable nature could ever be said to look ridiculous it was the case\nnow, when the oak stood naked-legged, and as if ashamed, till the\naxe-man came and cut a ring round it, and the two Timothys finished the\nwork with the crosscut-saw.\n\nAs soon as it had fallen the barkers attacked it like locusts, and in a\nshort time not a particle of rind was left on the trunk and larger\nlimbs.  Marty South was an adept at peeling the upper parts, and there\nshe stood encaged amid the mass of twigs and buds like a great bird,\nrunning her tool into the smallest branches, beyond the farthest points\nto which the skill and patience of the men enabled them to\nproceed--branches which, in their lifetime, had swayed high above the\nbulk of the wood, and caught the latest and earliest rays of the sun\nand moon while the lower part of the forest was still in darkness.\n\n\"You seem to have a better instrument than they, Marty,\" said Fitzpiers.\n\n\"No, sir,\" she said, holding up the tool--a horse's leg-bone fitted\ninto a handle and filed to an edge--\"'tis only that they've less\npatience with the twigs, because their time is worth more than mine.\"\n\nA little shed had been constructed on the spot, of thatched hurdles and\nboughs, and in front of it was a fire, over which a kettle sung.\nFitzpiers sat down inside the shelter, and went on with his reading,\nexcept when he looked up to observe the scene and the actors.  The\nthought that he might settle here and become welded in with this sylvan\nlife by marrying Grace Melbury crossed his mind for a moment.  Why\nshould he go farther into the world than where he was?  The secret of\nquiet happiness lay in limiting the ideas and aspirations; these men's\nthoughts were conterminous with the margin of the Hintock woodlands,\nand why should not his be likewise limited--a small practice among the\npeople around him being the bound of his desires?\n\nPresently Marty South discontinued her operations upon the quivering\nboughs, came out from the reclining oak, and prepared tea.  When it was\nready the men were called; and Fitzpiers being in a mood to join, sat\ndown with them.\n\nThe latent reason of his lingering here so long revealed itself when\nthe faint creaking of the joints of a vehicle became audible, and one\nof the men said, \"Here's he.\" Turning their heads they saw Melbury's\ngig approaching, the wheels muffled by the yielding moss.\n\nThe timber-merchant was on foot leading the horse, looking back at\nevery few steps to caution his daughter, who kept her seat, where and\nhow to duck her head so as to avoid the overhanging branches. They\nstopped at the spot where the bark-ripping had been temporarily\nsuspended; Melbury cursorily examined the heaps of bark, and drawing\nnear to where the workmen were sitting down, accepted their shouted\ninvitation to have a dish of tea, for which purpose he hitched the\nhorse to a bough.  Grace declined to take any of their beverage, and\nremained in her place in the vehicle, looking dreamily at the sunlight\nthat came in thin threads through the hollies with which the oaks were\ninterspersed.\n\nWhen Melbury stepped up close to the shelter, he for the first time\nperceived that the doctor was present, and warmly appreciated\nFitzpiers's invitation to sit down on the log beside him.\n\n\"Bless my heart, who would have thought of finding you here,\" he said,\nobviously much pleased at the circumstance.  \"I wonder now if my\ndaughter knows you are so nigh at hand.  I don't expect she do.\"\n\nHe looked out towards the gig wherein Grace sat, her face still turned\nin the opposite direction.  \"She doesn't see us.  Well, never mind: let\nher be.\"\n\nGrace was indeed quite unconscious of Fitzpiers's propinquity. She was\nthinking of something which had little connection with the scene before\nher--thinking of her friend, lost as soon as found, Mrs. Charmond; of\nher capricious conduct, and of the contrasting scenes she was possibly\nenjoying at that very moment in other climes, to which Grace herself\nhad hoped to be introduced by her friend's means.  She wondered if this\npatronizing lady would return to Hintock during the summer, and whether\nthe acquaintance which had been nipped on the last occasion of her\nresidence there would develop on the next.\n\nMelbury told ancient timber-stories as he sat, relating them directly\nto Fitzpiers, and obliquely to the men, who had heard them often\nbefore.  Marty, who poured out tea, was just saying, \"I think I'll take\nout a cup to Miss Grace,\" when they heard a clashing of the\ngig-harness, and turning round Melbury saw that the horse had become\nrestless, and was jerking about the vehicle in a way which alarmed its\noccupant, though she refrained from screaming.  Melbury jumped up\nimmediately, but not more quickly than Fitzpiers; and while her father\nran to the horse's head and speedily began to control him, Fitzpiers\nwas alongside the gig assisting Grace to descend.  Her surprise at his\nappearance was so great that, far from making a calm and independent\ndescent, she was very nearly lifted down in his arms.  He relinquished\nher when she touched ground, and hoped she was not frightened.\n\n\"Oh no, not much,\" she managed to say.  \"There was no danger--unless he\nhad run under the trees where the boughs are low enough to hit my head.\"\n\n\"Which was by no means an impossibility, and justifies any amount of\nalarm.\"\n\nHe referred to what he thought he saw written in her face, and she\ncould not tell him that this had little to do with the horse, but much\nwith himself.  His contiguity had, in fact, the same effect upon her as\non those former occasions when he had come closer to her than\nusual--that of producing in her an unaccountable tendency to\ntearfulness.  Melbury soon put the horse to rights, and seeing that\nGrace was safe, turned again to the work-people.  His daughter's\nnervous distress had passed off in a few moments, and she said quite\ngayly to Fitzpiers as she walked with him towards the group, \"There's\ndestiny in it, you see.  I was doomed to join in your picnic, although\nI did not intend to do so.\"\n\nMarty prepared her a comfortable place, and she sat down in the circle,\nand listened to Fitzpiers while he drew from her father and the\nbark-rippers sundry narratives of their fathers', their grandfathers',\nand their own adventures in these woods; of the mysterious sights they\nhad seen--only to be accounted for by supernatural agency; of white\nwitches and black witches; and the standard story of the spirits of the\ntwo brothers who had fought and fallen, and had haunted Hintock House\ntill they were exorcised by the priest, and compelled to retreat to a\nswamp in this very wood, whence they were returning to their old\nquarters at the rate of a cock's stride every New-year's Day, old\nstyle; hence the local saying, \"On New-year's tide, a cock's stride.\"\n\nIt was a pleasant time.  The smoke from the little fire of peeled\nsticks rose between the sitters and the sunlight, and behind its blue\nveil stretched the naked arms of the prostrate trees. The smell of the\nuncovered sap mingled with the smell of the burning wood, and the\nsticky inner surface of the scattered bark glistened as it revealed its\npale madder hues to the eye.  Melbury was so highly satisfied at having\nFitzpiers as a sort of guest that he would have sat on for any length\nof time, but Grace, on whom Fitzpiers's eyes only too frequently\nalighted, seemed to think it incumbent upon her to make a show of\ngoing; and her father thereupon accompanied her to the vehicle.\n\nAs the doctor had helped her out of it he appeared to think that he had\nexcellent reasons for helping her in, and performed the attention\nlingeringly enough.\n\n\"What were you almost in tears about just now?\" he asked, softly.\n\n\"I don't know,\" she said: and the words were strictly true.\n\nMelbury mounted on the other side, and they drove on out of the grove,\ntheir wheels silently crushing delicate-patterned mosses, hyacinths,\nprimroses, lords-and-ladies, and other strange and ordinary plants, and\ncracking up little sticks that lay across the track.  Their way\nhomeward ran along the crest of a lofty hill, whence on the right they\nbeheld a wide valley, differing both in feature and atmosphere from\nthat of the Hintock precincts.  It was the cider country, which met the\nwoodland district on the axis of this hill.  Over the vale the air was\nblue as sapphire--such a blue as outside that apple-valley was never\nseen.  Under the blue the orchards were in a blaze of bloom, some of\nthe richly flowered trees running almost up to where they drove along.\nOver a gate which opened down the incline a man leaned on his arms,\nregarding this fair promise so intently that he did not observe their\npassing.\n\n\"That was Giles,\" said Melbury, when they had gone by.\n\n\"Was it? Poor Giles,\" said she.\n\n\"All that blooth means heavy autumn work for him and his hands. If no\nblight happens before the setting the apple yield will be such as we\nhave not had for years.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in the wood they had come from, the men had sat on so long\nthat they were indisposed to begin work again that evening; they were\npaid by the ton, and their time for labor was as they chose.  They\nplaced the last gatherings of bark in rows for the curers, which led\nthem farther and farther away from the shed; and thus they gradually\nwithdrew as the sun went down.\n\nFitzpiers lingered yet.  He had opened his book again, though he could\nhardly see a word in it, and sat before the dying fire, scarcely\nknowing of the men's departure.  He dreamed and mused till his\nconsciousness seemed to occupy the whole space of the woodland around,\nso little was there of jarring sight or sound to hinder perfect unity\nwith the sentiment of the place.  The idea returned upon him of\nsacrificing all practical aims to live in calm contentment here, and\ninstead of going on elaborating new conceptions with infinite pains, to\naccept quiet domesticity according to oldest and homeliest notions.\nThese reflections detained him till the wood was embrowned with the\ncoming night, and the shy little bird of this dusky time had begun to\npour out all the intensity of his eloquence from a bush not very far\noff.\n\nFitzpiers's eyes commanded as much of the ground in front as was open.\nEntering upon this he saw a figure, whose direction of movement was\ntowards the spot where he sat.  The surgeon was quite shrouded from\nobservation by the recessed shadow of the hut, and there was no reason\nwhy he should move till the stranger had passed by.  The shape resolved\nitself into a woman's; she was looking on the ground, and walking\nslowly as if searching for something that had been lost, her course\nbeing precisely that of Mr. Melbury's gig.  Fitzpiers by a sort of\ndivination jumped to the idea that the figure was Grace's; her nearer\napproach made the guess a certainty.\n\nYes, she was looking for something; and she came round by the prostrate\ntrees that would have been invisible but for the white nakedness which\nenabled her to avoid them easily.  Thus she approached the heap of\nashes, and acting upon what was suggested by a still shining ember or\ntwo, she took a stick and stirred the heap, which thereupon burst into\na flame.  On looking around by the light thus obtained she for the\nfirst time saw the illumined face of Fitzpiers, precisely in the spot\nwhere she had left him.\n\nGrace gave a start and a scream: the place had been associated with him\nin her thoughts, but she had not expected to find him there still.\nFitzpiers lost not a moment in rising and going to her side.\n\n\"I frightened you dreadfully, I know,\" he said.  \"I ought to have\nspoken; but I did not at first expect it to be you.  I have been\nsitting here ever since.\"\n\nHe was actually supporting her with his arm, as though under the\nimpression that she was quite overcome, and in danger of falling. As\nsoon as she could collect her ideas she gently withdrew from his grasp,\nand explained what she had returned for: in getting up or down from the\ngig, or when sitting by the hut fire, she had dropped her purse.\n\n\"Now we will find it,\" said Fitzpiers.\n\nHe threw an armful of last year's leaves on to the fire, which made the\nflame leap higher, and the encompassing shades to weave themselves into\na denser contrast, turning eve into night in a moment.  By this\nradiance they groped about on their hands and knees, till Fitzpiers\nrested on his elbow, and looked at Grace. \"We must always meet in odd\ncircumstances,\" he said; \"and this is one of the oddest.  I wonder if\nit means anything?\"\n\n\"Oh no, I am sure it doesn't,\" said Grace in haste, quickly assuming an\nerect posture.  \"Pray don't say it any more.\"\n\n\"I hope there was not much money in the purse,\" said Fitzpiers, rising\nto his feet more slowly, and brushing the leaves from his trousers.\n\n\"Scarcely any.  I cared most about the purse itself, because it was\ngiven me.  Indeed, money is of little more use at Hintock than on\nCrusoe's island; there's hardly any way of spending it.\"\n\nThey had given up the search when Fitzpiers discerned something by his\nfoot.  \"Here it is,\" he said, \"so that your father, mother, friend, or\nADMIRER will not have his or her feelings hurt by a sense of your\nnegligence after all.\"\n\n\"Oh, he knows nothing of what I do now.\"\n\n\"The admirer?\" said Fitzpiers, slyly.\n\n\"I don't know if you would call him that,\" said Grace, with simplicity.\n\"The admirer is a superficial, conditional creature, and this person is\nquite different.\"\n\n\"He has all the cardinal virtues.\"\n\n\"Perhaps--though I don't know them precisely.\"\n\n\"You unconsciously practise them, Miss Melbury, which is better.\nAccording to Schleiermacher they are Self-control, Perseverance,\nWisdom, and Love; and his is the best list that I know.\"\n\n\"I am afraid poor--\" She was going to say that she feared\nWinterborne--the giver of the purse years before--had not much\nperseverance, though he had all the other three; but she determined to\ngo no further in this direction, and was silent.\n\nThese half-revelations made a perceptible difference in Fitzpiers. His\nsense of personal superiority wasted away, and Grace assumed in his\neyes the true aspect of a mistress in her lover's regard.\n\n\"Miss Melbury,\" he said, suddenly, \"I divine that this virtuous man you\nmention has been refused by you?\"\n\nShe could do no otherwise than admit it.\n\n\"I do not inquire without good reason.  God forbid that I should kneel\nin another's place at any shrine unfairly.  But, my dear Miss Melbury,\nnow that he is gone, may I draw near?\"\n\n\"I--I can't say anything about that!\" she cried, quickly. \"Because when\na man has been refused you feel pity for him, and like him more than\nyou did before.\"\n\nThis increasing complication added still more value to Grace in the\nsurgeon's eyes: it rendered her adorable.  \"But cannot you say?\" he\npleaded, distractedly.\n\n\"I'd rather not--I think I must go home at once.\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" said Fitzpiers.  But as he did not move she felt it awkward\nto walk straight away from him; and so they stood silently together.  A\ndiversion was created by the accident of two birds, that had either\nbeen roosting above their heads or nesting there, tumbling one over the\nother into the hot ashes at their feet, apparently engrossed in a\ndesperate quarrel that prevented the use of their wings.  They speedily\nparted, however, and flew up, and were seen no more.\n\n\"That's the end of what is called love!\" said some one.\n\nThe speaker was neither Grace nor Fitzpiers, but Marty South, who\napproached with her face turned up to the sky in her endeavor to trace\nthe birds.  Suddenly perceiving Grace, she exclaimed, \"Oh, Miss\nMelbury! I have been following they pigeons, and didn't see you.  And\nhere's Mr. Winterborne!\" she continued, shyly, as she looked towards\nFitzpiers, who stood in the background.\n\n\"Marty,\" Grace interrupted.  \"I want you to walk home with me--will\nyou? Come along.\" And without lingering longer she took hold of Marty's\narm and led her away.\n\nThey went between the spectral arms of the peeled trees as they lay,\nand onward among the growing trees, by a path where there were no oaks,\nand no barking, and no Fitzpiers--nothing but copse-wood, between\nwhich the primroses could be discerned in pale bunches.  \"I didn't know\nMr. Winterborne was there,\" said Marty, breaking the silence when they\nhad nearly reached Grace's door.\n\n\"Nor was he,\" said Grace.\n\n\"But, Miss Melbury, I saw him.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Grace.  \"It was somebody else.  Giles Winterborne is nothing\nto me.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\nThe leaves over Hintock grew denser in their substance, and the\nwoodland seemed to change from an open filigree to a solid opaque body\nof infinitely larger shape and importance.  The boughs cast green\nshades, which hurt the complexion of the girls who walked there; and a\nfringe of them which overhung Mr. Melbury's garden dripped on his\nseed-plots when it rained, pitting their surface all over as with\npock-marks, till Melbury declared that gardens in such a place were no\ngood at all.  The two trees that had creaked all the winter left off\ncreaking, the whir of the night-jar, however, forming a very\nsatisfactory continuation of uncanny music from that quarter.  Except\nat mid-day the sun was not seen complete by the Hintock people, but\nrather in the form of numerous little stars staring through the leaves.\n\nSuch an appearance it had on Midsummer Eve of this year, and as the\nhour grew later, and nine o'clock drew on, the irradiation of the\ndaytime became broken up by weird shadows and ghostly nooks of\nindistinctness.  Imagination could trace upon the trunks and boughs\nstrange faces and figures shaped by the dying lights; the surfaces of\nthe holly-leaves would here and there shine like peeping eyes, while\nsuch fragments of the sky as were visible between the trunks assumed\nthe aspect of sheeted forms and cloven tongues.  This was before the\nmoonrise.  Later on, when that planet was getting command of the upper\nheaven, and consequently shining with an unbroken face into such open\nglades as there were in the neighborhood of the hamlet, it became\napparent that the margin of the wood which approached the\ntimber-merchant's premises was not to be left to the customary\nstillness of that reposeful time.\n\nFitzpiers having heard a voice or voices, was looking over his garden\ngate--where he now looked more frequently than into his books--fancying\nthat Grace might be abroad with some friends.  He was now irretrievably\ncommitted in heart to Grace Melbury, though he was by no means sure\nthat she was so far committed to him. That the Idea had for once\ncompletely fulfilled itself in the objective substance--which he had\nhitherto deemed an impossibility--he was enchanted enough to fancy must\nbe the case at last.  It was not Grace who had passed, however, but\nseveral of the ordinary village girls in a group--some steadily\nwalking, some in a mood of wild gayety.  He quietly asked his landlady,\nwho was also in the garden, what these girls were intending, and she\ninformed him that it being Old Midsummer Eve, they were about to\nattempt some spell or enchantment which would afford them a glimpse of\ntheir future partners for life.  She declared it to be an ungodly\nperformance, and one which she for her part would never countenance;\nsaying which, she entered her house and retired to bed.\n\nThe young man lit a cigar and followed the bevy of maidens slowly up\nthe road.  They had turned into the wood at an opening between\nMelbury's and Marty South's; but Fitzpiers could easily track them by\ntheir voices, low as they endeavored to keep their tones.\n\nIn the mean time other inhabitants of Little Hintock had become aware\nof the nocturnal experiment about to be tried, and were also sauntering\nstealthily after the frisky maidens.  Miss Melbury had been informed by\nMarty South during the day of the proposed peep into futurity, and,\nbeing only a girl like the rest, she was sufficiently interested to\nwish to see the issue.  The moon was so bright and the night so calm\nthat she had no difficulty in persuading Mrs. Melbury to accompany her;\nand thus, joined by Marty, these went onward in the same direction.\n\nPassing Winterborne's house, they heard a noise of hammering. Marty\nexplained it.  This was the last night on which his paternal roof would\nshelter him, the days of grace since it fell into hand having expired;\nand Giles was taking down his cupboards and bedsteads with a view to an\nearly exit next morning.  His encounter with Mrs. Charmond had cost him\ndearly.\n\nWhen they had proceeded a little farther Marty was joined by Grammer\nOliver (who was as young as the youngest in such matters), and Grace\nand Mrs. Melbury went on by themselves till they had arrived at the\nspot chosen by the village daughters, whose primary intention of\nkeeping their expedition a secret had been quite defeated.  Grace and\nher step-mother paused by a holly-tree; and at a little distance stood\nFitzpiers under the shade of a young oak, intently observing Grace, who\nwas in the full rays of the moon.\n\nHe watched her without speaking, and unperceived by any but Marty and\nGrammer, who had drawn up on the dark side of the same holly which\nsheltered Mrs. and Miss Melbury on its bright side.  The two former\nconversed in low tones.\n\n\"If they two come up in Wood next Midsummer Night they'll come as one,\"\nsaid Grammer, signifying Fitzpiers and Grace.  \"Instead of my\nskellington he'll carry home her living carcass before long. But though\nshe's a lady in herself, and worthy of any such as he, it do seem to me\nthat he ought to marry somebody more of the sort of Mrs. Charmond, and\nthat Miss Grace should make the best of Winterborne.\"\n\nMarty returned no comment; and at that minute the girls, some of whom\nwere from Great Hintock, were seen advancing to work the incantation,\nit being now about midnight.\n\n\"Directly we see anything we'll run home as fast as we can,\" said one,\nwhose courage had begun to fail her.  To this the rest assented, not\nknowing that a dozen neighbors lurked in the bushes around.\n\n\"I wish we had not thought of trying this,\" said another, \"but had\ncontented ourselves with the hole-digging to-morrow at twelve, and\nhearing our husbands' trades.  It is too much like having dealings with\nthe Evil One to try to raise their forms.\"\n\nHowever, they had gone too far to recede, and slowly began to march\nforward in a skirmishing line through the trees towards the deeper\nrecesses of the wood.  As far as the listeners could gather, the\nparticular form of black-art to be practised on this occasion was one\nconnected with the sowing of hemp-seed, a handful of which was carried\nby each girl.  At the moment of their advance they looked back, and\ndiscerned the figure of Miss Melbury, who, alone of all the observers,\nstood in the full face of the moonlight, deeply engrossed in the\nproceedings.  By contrast with her life of late years they made her\nfeel as if she had receded a couple of centuries in the world's\nhistory.  She was rendered doubly conspicuous by her light dress, and\nafter a few whispered words, one of the girls--a bouncing maiden,\nplighted to young Timothy Tangs--asked her if she would join in.\nGrace, with some excitement, said that she would, and moved on a little\nin the rear of the rest.\n\nSoon the listeners could hear nothing of their proceedings beyond the\nfaintest occasional rustle of leaves.  Grammer whispered again to\nMarty: \"Why didn't ye go and try your luck with the rest of the maids?\"\n\n\"I don't believe in it,\" said Marty, shortly.\n\n\"Why, half the parish is here--the silly hussies should have kept it\nquiet.  I see Mr. Winterborne through the leaves, just come up with\nRobert Creedle.  Marty, we ought to act the part o' Providence\nsometimes.  Do go and tell him that if he stands just behind the bush\nat the bottom of the slope, Miss Grace must pass down it when she comes\nback, and she will most likely rush into his arms; for as soon as the\nclock strikes, they'll bundle back home--along like hares.  I've seen\nsuch larries before.\"\n\n\"Do you think I'd better?\" said Marty, reluctantly.\n\n\"Oh yes, he'll bless ye for it.\"\n\n\"I don't want that kind of blessing.\" But after a moment's thought she\nwent and delivered the information; and Grammer had the satisfaction of\nseeing Giles walk slowly to the bend in the leafy defile along which\nGrace would have to return.\n\nMeanwhile Mrs. Melbury, deserted by Grace, had perceived Fitzpiers and\nWinterborne, and also the move of the latter.  An improvement on\nGrammer's idea entered the mind of Mrs. Melbury, for she had lately\ndiscerned what her husband had not--that Grace was rapidly fascinating\nthe surgeon.  She therefore drew near to Fitzpiers.\n\n\"You should be where Mr. Winterborne is standing,\" she said to him,\nsignificantly.  \"She will run down through that opening much faster\nthan she went up it, if she is like the rest of the girls.\"\n\nFitzpiers did not require to be told twice.  He went across to\nWinterborne and stood beside him.  Each knew the probable purpose of\nthe other in standing there, and neither spoke, Fitzpiers scorning to\nlook upon Winterborne as a rival, and Winterborne adhering to the\noff-hand manner of indifference which had grown upon him since his\ndismissal.\n\nNeither Grammer nor Marty South had seen the surgeon's manoeuvre, and,\nstill to help Winterborne, as she supposed, the old woman suggested to\nthe wood-girl that she should walk forward at the heels of Grace, and\n\"tole\" her down the required way if she showed a tendency to run in\nanother direction.  Poor Marty, always doomed to sacrifice desire to\nobligation, walked forward accordingly, and waited as a beacon, still\nand silent, for the retreat of Grace and her giddy companions, now\nquite out of hearing.\n\nThe first sound to break the silence was the distant note of Great\nHintock clock striking the significant hour.  About a minute later that\nquarter of the wood to which the girls had wandered resounded with the\nflapping of disturbed birds; then two or three hares and rabbits\nbounded down the glade from the same direction, and after these the\nrustling and crackling of leaves and dead twigs denoted the hurried\napproach of the adventurers, whose fluttering gowns soon became\nvisible.  Miss Melbury, having gone forward quite in the rear of the\nrest, was one of the first to return, and the excitement being\ncontagious, she ran laughing towards Marty, who still stood as a\nhand-post to guide her; then, passing on, she flew round the fatal bush\nwhere the undergrowth narrowed to a gorge.  Marty arrived at her heels\njust in time to see the result. Fitzpiers had quickly stepped forward\nin front of Winterborne, who, disdaining to shift his position, had\nturned on his heel, and then the surgeon did what he would not have\nthought of doing but for Mrs. Melbury's encouragement and the sentiment\nof an eve which effaced conventionality.  Stretching out his arms as\nthe white figure burst upon him, he captured her in a moment, as if she\nhad been a bird.\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Grace, in her fright.\n\n\"You are in my arms, dearest,\" said Fitzpiers, \"and I am going to claim\nyou, and keep you there all our two lives!\"\n\nShe rested on him like one utterly mastered, and it was several seconds\nbefore she recovered from this helplessness.  Subdued screams and\nstruggles, audible from neighboring brakes, revealed that there had\nbeen other lurkers thereabout for a similar purpose.  Grace, unlike\nmost of these companions of hers, instead of gasping and writhing, said\nin a trembling voice, \"Mr. Fitzpiers, will you let me go?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" he said, laughing; \"as soon as you have recovered.\"\n\nShe waited another few moments, then quietly and firmly pushed him\naside, and glided on her path, the moon whitening her hot blush away.\nBut it had been enough--new relations between them had begun.\n\nThe case of the other girls was different, as has been said.  They\nwrestled and tittered, only escaping after a desperate struggle.\nFitzpiers could hear these enactments still going on after Grace had\nleft him, and he remained on the spot where he had caught her,\nWinterborne having gone away.  On a sudden another girl came bounding\ndown the same descent that had been followed by Grace--a fine-framed\nyoung woman with naked arms.  Seeing Fitzpiers standing there, she\nsaid, with playful effrontery, \"May'st kiss me if 'canst catch me, Tim!\"\n\nFitzpiers recognized her as Suke Damson, a hoydenish damsel of the\nhamlet, who was plainly mistaking him for her lover.  He was\nimpulsively disposed to profit by her error, and as soon as she began\nracing away he started in pursuit.\n\nOn she went under the boughs, now in light, now in shade, looking over\nher shoulder at him every few moments and kissing her hand; but so\ncunningly dodging about among the trees and moon-shades that she never\nallowed him to get dangerously near her.  Thus they ran and doubled,\nFitzpiers warming with the chase, till the sound of their companions\nhad quite died away.  He began to lose hope of ever overtaking her,\nwhen all at once, by way of encouragement, she turned to a fence in\nwhich there was a stile and leaped over it.  Outside the scene was a\nchanged one--a meadow, where the half-made hay lay about in heaps, in\nthe uninterrupted shine of the now high moon.\n\nFitzpiers saw in a moment that, having taken to open ground, she had\nplaced herself at his mercy, and he promptly vaulted over after her.\nShe flitted a little way down the mead, when all at once her light form\ndisappeared as if it had sunk into the earth. She had buried herself in\none of the hay-cocks.\n\nFitzpiers, now thoroughly excited, was not going to let her escape him\nthus.  He approached, and set about turning over the heaps one by one.\nAs soon as he paused, tantalized and puzzled, he was directed anew by\nan imitative kiss which came from her hiding-place, and by snatches of\na local ballad in the smallest voice she could assume:\n\n    \"O come in from the foggy, foggy dew.\"\n\n\nIn a minute or two he uncovered her.\n\n\"Oh, 'tis not Tim!\" said she, burying her face.\n\nFitzpiers, however, disregarded her resistance by reason of its\nmildness, stooped and imprinted the purposed kiss, then sunk down on\nthe next hay-cock, panting with his race.\n\n\"Whom do you mean by Tim?\" he asked, presently.\n\n\"My young man, Tim Tangs,\" said she.\n\n\"Now, honor bright, did you really think it was he?\"\n\n\"I did at first.\"\n\n\"But you didn't at last?\"\n\n\"I didn't at last.\"\n\n\"Do you much mind that it was not?\"\n\n\"No,\" she answered, slyly.\n\nFitzpiers did not pursue his questioning.  In the moonlight Suke looked\nvery beautiful, the scratches and blemishes incidental to her out-door\noccupation being invisible under these pale rays. While they remain\nsilent the coarse whir of the eternal night-jar burst sarcastically\nfrom the top of a tree at the nearest corner of the wood.  Besides this\nnot a sound of any kind reached their ears, the time of nightingales\nbeing now past, and Hintock lying at a distance of two miles at least.\nIn the opposite direction the hay-field stretched away into remoteness\ntill it was lost to the eye in a soft mist.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\nWhen the general stampede occurred Winterborne had also been looking\non, and encountering one of the girls, had asked her what caused them\nall to fly.\n\nShe said with solemn breathlessness that they had seen something very\ndifferent from what they had hoped to see, and that she for one would\nnever attempt such unholy ceremonies again.  \"We saw Satan pursuing us\nwith his hour-glass.  It was terrible!\"\n\nThis account being a little incoherent, Giles went forward towards the\nspot from which the girls had retreated.  After listening there a few\nminutes he heard slow footsteps rustling over the leaves, and looking\nthrough a tangled screen of honeysuckle which hung from a bough, he saw\nin the open space beyond a short stout man in evening-dress, carrying\non one arm a light overcoat and also his hat, so awkwardly arranged as\npossibly to have suggested the \"hour-glass\" to his timid observers--if\nthis were the person whom the girls had seen.  With the other hand he\nsilently gesticulated and the moonlight falling upon his bare brow\nshowed him to have dark hair and a high forehead of the shape seen\noftener in old prints and paintings than in real life.  His curious and\naltogether alien aspect, his strange gestures, like those of one who is\nrehearsing a scene to himself, and the unusual place and hour, were\nsufficient to account for any trepidation among the Hintock daughters\nat encountering him.\n\nHe paused, and looked round, as if he had forgotten where he was; not\nobserving Giles, who was of the color of his environment.  The latter\nadvanced into the light.  The gentleman held up his hand and came\ntowards Giles, the two meeting half-way.\n\n\"I have lost my way,\" said the stranger.  \"Perhaps you can put me in\nthe path again.\"  He wiped his forehead with the air of one suffering\nunder an agitation more than that of simple fatigue.\n\n\"The turnpike-road is over there,\" said Giles\n\n\"I don't want the turnpike-road,\" said the gentleman, impatiently. \"I\ncame from that.  I want Hintock House.  Is there not a path to it\nacross here?\"\n\n\"Well, yes, a sort of path.  But it is hard to find from this point.\nI'll show you the way, sir, with great pleasure.\"\n\n\"Thanks, my good friend.  The truth is that I decided to walk across\nthe country after dinner from the hotel at Sherton, where I am staying\nfor a day or two.  But I did not know it was so far.\"\n\n\"It is about a mile to the house from here.\"\n\nThey walked on together.  As there was no path, Giles occasionally\nstepped in front and bent aside the underboughs of the trees to give\nhis companion a passage, saying every now and then when the twigs, on\nbeing released, flew back like whips, \"Mind your eyes, sir.\" To which\nthe stranger replied, \"Yes, yes,\" in a preoccupied tone.\n\nSo they went on, the leaf-shadows running in their usual quick\nsuccession over the forms of the pedestrians, till the stranger said,\n\n\"Is it far?\"\n\n\"Not much farther,\" said Winterborne.  \"The plantation runs up into a\ncorner here, close behind the house.\" He added with hesitation, \"You\nknow, I suppose, sir, that Mrs. Charmond is not at home?\"\n\n\"You mistake,\" said the other, quickly.  \"Mrs.  Charmond has been away\nfor some time, but she's at home now.\"\n\nGiles did not contradict him, though he felt sure that the gentleman\nwas wrong.\n\n\"You are a native of this place?\" the stranger said.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, you are happy in having a home.  It is what I don't possess.\"\n\n\"You come from far, seemingly?\"\n\n\"I come now from the south of Europe.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed, sir.  You are an Italian, or Spanish, or French gentleman,\nperhaps?\"\n\n\"I am not either.\"\n\nGiles did not fill the pause which ensued, and the gentleman, who\nseemed of an emotional nature, unable to resist friendship, at length\nanswered the question.\n\n\"I am an Italianized American, a South Carolinian by birth,\" he said.\n\"I left my native country on the failure of the Southern cause, and\nhave never returned to it since.\"\n\nHe spoke no more about himself, and they came to the verge of the wood.\nHere, striding over the fence out upon the upland sward, they could at\nonce see the chimneys of the house in the gorge immediately beneath\ntheir position, silent, still, and pale.\n\n\"Can you tell me the time?\" the gentleman asked.  \"My watch has\nstopped.\"\n\n\"It is between twelve and one,\" said Giles.\n\nHis companion expressed his astonishment.  \"I thought it between nine\nand ten at latest! Dear me--dear me!\"\n\nHe now begged Giles to return, and offered him a gold coin, which\nlooked like a sovereign, for the assistance rendered.  Giles declined\nto accept anything, to the surprise of the stranger, who, on putting\nthe money back into his pocket, said, awkwardly, \"I offered it because\nI want you to utter no word about this meeting with me.  Will you\npromise?\"\n\nWinterborne promised readily.  He thereupon stood still while the other\nascended the slope.  At the bottom he looked back dubiously. Giles\nwould no longer remain when he was so evidently desired to leave, and\nreturned through the boughs to Hintock.\n\nHe suspected that this man, who seemed so distressed and melancholy,\nmight be that lover and persistent wooer of Mrs. Charmond whom he had\nheard so frequently spoken of, and whom it was said she had treated\ncavalierly.  But he received no confirmation of his suspicion beyond a\nreport which reached him a few days later that a gentleman had called\nup the servants who were taking care of Hintock House at an hour past\nmidnight; and on learning that Mrs. Charmond, though returned from\nabroad, was as yet in London, he had sworn bitterly, and gone away\nwithout leaving a card or any trace of himself.\n\nThe girls who related the story added that he sighed three times before\nhe swore, but this part of the narrative was not corroborated.  Anyhow,\nsuch a gentleman had driven away from the hotel at Sherton next day in\na carriage hired at that inn.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\nThe sunny, leafy week which followed the tender doings of Midsummer Eve\nbrought a visitor to Fitzpiers's door; a voice that he knew sounded in\nthe passage.  Mr. Melbury had called.  At first he had a particular\nobjection to enter the parlor, because his boots were dusty, but as the\nsurgeon insisted he waived the point and came in.\n\nLooking neither to the right nor to the left, hardly at Fitzpiers\nhimself, he put his hat under his chair, and with a preoccupied gaze at\nthe floor, he said, \"I've called to ask you, doctor, quite privately, a\nquestion that troubles me.  I've a daughter, Grace, an only daughter,\nas you may have heard.  Well, she's been out in the dew--on Midsummer\nEve in particular she went out in thin slippers to watch some vagary of\nthe Hintock maids--and she's got a cough, a distinct hemming and\nhacking, that makes me uneasy. Now, I have decided to send her away to\nsome seaside place for a change--\"\n\n\"Send her away!\" Fitzpiers's countenance had fallen.\n\n\"Yes.  And the question is, where would you advise me to send her?\"\n\nThe timber-merchant had happened to call at a moment when Fitzpiers was\nat the spring-tide of a sentiment that Grace was a necessity of his\nexistence.  The sudden pressure of her form upon his breast as she came\nheadlong round the bush had never ceased to linger with him, ever since\nhe adopted the manoeuvre for which the hour and the moonlight and the\noccasion had been the only excuse. Now she was to be sent away.\nAmbition? it could be postponed. Family? culture and reciprocity of\ntastes had taken the place of family nowadays.  He allowed himself to\nbe carried forward on the wave of his desire.\n\n\"How strange, how very strange it is,\" he said, \"that you should have\ncome to me about her just now.  I have been thinking every day of\ncoming to you on the very same errand.\"\n\n\"Ah!--you have noticed, too, that her health----\"\n\n\"I have noticed nothing the matter with her health, because there is\nnothing.  But, Mr. Melbury, I have seen your daughter several times by\naccident.  I have admired her infinitely, and I was coming to ask you\nif I may become better acquainted with her--pay my addresses to her?\"\n\nMelbury was looking down as he listened, and did not see the air of\nhalf-misgiving at his own rashness that spread over Fitzpiers's face as\nhe made this declaration.\n\n\"You have--got to know her?\" said Melbury, a spell of dead silence\nhaving preceded his utterance, during which his emotion rose with\nalmost visible effect.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Fitzpiers.\n\n\"And you wish to become better acquainted with her? You mean with a\nview to marriage--of course that is what you mean?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the young man.  \"I mean, get acquainted with her, with a\nview to being her accepted lover; and if we suited each other, what\nwould naturally follow.\"\n\nThe timber-merchant was much surprised, and fairly agitated; his hand\ntrembled as he laid by his walking-stick.  \"This takes me unawares,\"\nsaid he, his voice wellnigh breaking down.  \"I don't mean that there is\nanything unexpected in a gentleman being attracted by her; but it did\nnot occur to me that it would be you. I always said,\" continued he,\nwith a lump in his throat, \"that my Grace would make a mark at her own\nlevel some day.  That was why I educated her.  I said to myself, 'I'll\ndo it, cost what it may;' though her mother-law was pretty frightened\nat my paying out so much money year after year.  I knew it would tell\nin the end. 'Where you've not good material to work on, such doings\nwould be waste and vanity,' I said.  'But where you have that material\nit is sure to be worth while.'\"\n\n\"I am glad you don't object,\" said Fitzpiers, almost wishing that Grace\nhad not been quite so cheap for him.\n\n\"If she is willing I don't object, certainly.  Indeed,\" added the\nhonest man, \"it would be deceit if I were to pretend to feel anything\nelse than highly honored personally; and it is a great credit to her to\nhave drawn to her a man of such good professional station and venerable\nold family.  That huntsman-fellow little thought how wrong he was about\nher! Take her and welcome, sir.\"\n\n\"I'll endeavor to ascertain her mind.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes.  But she will be agreeable, I should think.  She ought to\nbe.\"\n\n\"I hope she may.  Well, now you'll expect to see me frequently.\"\n\n\"Oh yes.  But, name it all--about her cough, and her going away. I had\nquite forgot that that was what I came about.\"\n\n\"I assure you,\" said the surgeon, \"that her cough can only be the\nresult of a slight cold, and it is not necessary to banish her to any\nseaside place at all.\"\n\nMelbury looked unconvinced, doubting whether he ought to take\nFitzpiers's professional opinion in circumstances which naturally led\nhim to wish to keep her there.  The doctor saw this, and honestly\ndreading to lose sight of her, he said, eagerly, \"Between ourselves, if\nI am successful with her I will take her away myself for a month or\ntwo, as soon as we are married, which I hope will be before the chilly\nweather comes on.  This will be so very much better than letting her go\nnow.\"\n\nThe proposal pleased Melbury much.  There could be hardly any danger in\npostponing any desirable change of air as long as the warm weather\nlasted, and for such a reason.  Suddenly recollecting himself, he said,\n\"Your time must be precious, doctor.  I'll get home-along.  I am much\nobliged to ye.  As you will see her often, you'll discover for yourself\nif anything serious is the matter.\"\n\n\"I can assure you it is nothing,\" said Fitzpiers, who had seen Grace\nmuch oftener already than her father knew of.\n\nWhen he was gone Fitzpiers paused, silent, registering his sensations,\nlike a man who has made a plunge for a pearl into a medium of which he\nknows not the density or temperature.  But he had done it, and Grace\nwas the sweetest girl alive.\n\nAs for the departed visitor, his own last words lingered in Melbury's\nears as he walked homeward; he felt that what he had said in the\nemotion of the moment was very stupid, ungenteel, and unsuited to a\ndialogue with an educated gentleman, the smallness of whose practice\nwas more than compensated by the former greatness of his family.  He\nhad uttered thoughts before they were weighed, and almost before they\nwere shaped.  They had expressed in a certain sense his feeling at\nFitzpiers's news, but yet they were not right.  Looking on the ground,\nand planting his stick at each tread as if it were a flag-staff, he\nreached his own precincts, where, as he passed through the court, he\nautomatically stopped to look at the men working in the shed and\naround.  One of them asked him a question about wagon-spokes.\n\n\"Hey?\" said Melbury, looking hard at him.  The man repeated the words.\n\nMelbury stood; then turning suddenly away without answering, he went up\nthe court and entered the house.  As time was no object with the\njourneymen, except as a thing to get past, they leisurely surveyed the\ndoor through which he had disappeared.\n\n\"What maggot has the gaffer got in his head now?\" said Tangs the elder.\n\"Sommit to do with that chiel of his! When you've got a maid of yer\nown, John Upjohn, that costs ye what she costs him, that will take the\nsqueak out of your Sunday shoes, John! But you'll never be tall enough\nto accomplish such as she; and 'tis a lucky thing for ye, John, as\nthings be.  Well, he ought to have a dozen--that would bring him to\nreason.  I see 'em walking together last Sunday, and when they came to\na puddle he lifted her over like a halfpenny doll.  He ought to have a\ndozen; he'd let 'em walk through puddles for themselves then.\"\n\nMeanwhile Melbury had entered the house with the look of a man who sees\na vision before him.  His wife was in the room.  Without taking off his\nhat he sat down at random.\n\n\"Luce--we've done it!\" he said.  \"Yes--the thing is as I expected. The\nspell, that I foresaw might be worked, has worked.  She's done it, and\ndone it well.  Where is she--Grace, I mean?\"\n\n\"Up in her room--what has happened!\"\n\nMr. Melbury explained the circumstances as coherently as he could. \"I\ntold you so,\" he said.  \"A maid like her couldn't stay hid long, even\nin a place like this.  But where is Grace? Let's have her down.\nHere--Gra-a-ace!\"\n\nShe appeared after a reasonable interval, for she was sufficiently\nspoiled by this father of hers not to put herself in a hurry, however\nimpatient his tones.  \"What is it, father?\" said she, with a smile.\n\n\"Why, you scamp, what's this you've been doing? Not home here more than\nsix months, yet, instead of confining yourself to your father's rank,\nmaking havoc in the educated classes.\"\n\nThough accustomed to show herself instantly appreciative of her\nfather's meanings, Grace was fairly unable to look anyhow but at a loss\nnow.\n\n\"No, no--of course you don't know what I mean, or you pretend you\ndon't; though, for my part, I believe women can see these things\nthrough a double hedge.  But I suppose I must tell ye.  Why, you've\nflung your grapnel over the doctor, and he's coming courting forthwith.\"\n\n\"Only think of that, my dear! Don't you feel it a triumph?\" said Mrs.\nMelbury.\n\n\"Coming courting! I've done nothing to make him,\" Grace exclaimed.\n\n\"'Twasn't necessary that you should, 'Tis voluntary that rules in these\nthings....Well, he has behaved very honorably, and asked my consent.\nYou'll know what to do when he gets here, I dare say.  I needn't tell\nyou to make it all smooth for him.\"\n\n\"You mean, to lead him on to marry me?\"\n\n\"I do.  Haven't I educated you for it?\"\n\nGrace looked out of the window and at the fireplace with no animation\nin her face.  \"Why is it settled off-hand in this way?\" said she,\ncoquettishly.  \"You'll wait till you hear what I think of him, I\nsuppose?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, of course.  But you see what a good thing it will be.\"\n\nShe weighed the statement without speaking.\n\n\"You will be restored to the society you've been taken away from,\"\ncontinued her father; \"for I don't suppose he'll stay here long.\"\n\nShe admitted the advantage; but it was plain that though Fitzpiers\nexercised a certain fascination over her when he was present, or even\nmore, an almost psychic influence, and though his impulsive act in the\nwood had stirred her feelings indescribably, she had never regarded him\nin the light of a destined husband.  \"I don't know what to answer,\" she\nsaid.  \"I have learned that he is very clever.\"\n\n\"He's all right, and he's coming here to see you.\"\n\nA premonition that she could not resist him if he came strangely moved\nher.  \"Of course, father, you remember that it is only lately that\nGiles--\"\n\n\"You know that you can't think of him.  He has given up all claim to\nyou.\"\n\nShe could not explain the subtleties of her feeling as he could state\nhis opinion, even though she had skill in speech, and her father had\nnone.  That Fitzpiers acted upon her like a dram, exciting her,\nthrowing her into a novel atmosphere which biassed her doings until the\ninfluence was over, when she felt something of the nature of regret for\nthe mood she had experienced--still more if she reflected on the\nsilent, almost sarcastic, criticism apparent in Winterborne's air\ntowards her--could not be told to this worthy couple in words.\n\nIt so happened that on this very day Fitzpiers was called away from\nHintock by an engagement to attend some medical meetings, and his\nvisits, therefore, did not begin at once.  A note, however, arrived\nfrom him addressed to Grace, deploring his enforced absence.  As a\nmaterial object this note was pretty and superfine, a note of a sort\nthat she had been unaccustomed to see since her return to Hintock,\nexcept when a school friend wrote to her--a rare instance, for the\ngirls were respecters of persons, and many cooled down towards the\ntimber-dealer's daughter when she was out of sight.  Thus the receipt\nof it pleased her, and she afterwards walked about with a reflective\nair.\n\nIn the evening her father, who knew that the note had come, said, \"Why\nbe ye not sitting down to answer your letter? That's what young folks\ndid in my time.\"\n\nShe replied that it did not require an answer.\n\n\"Oh, you know best,\" he said.  Nevertheless, he went about his business\ndoubting if she were right in not replying; possibly she might be so\nmismanaging matters as to risk the loss of an alliance which would\nbring her much happiness.\n\nMelbury's respect for Fitzpiers was based less on his professional\nposition, which was not much, than on the standing of his family in the\ncounty in by-gone days.  That implicit faith in members of\nlong-established families, as such, irrespective of their personal\ncondition or character, which is still found among old-fashioned people\nin the rural districts reached its full intensity in Melbury.  His\ndaughter's suitor was descended from a family he had heard of in his\ngrandfather's time as being once great, a family which had conferred\nits name upon a neighboring village; how, then, could anything be amiss\nin this betrothal?\n\n\"I must keep her up to this,\" he said to his wife.  \"She sees it is for\nher happiness; but still she's young, and may want a little prompting\nfrom an older tongue.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\nWith this in view he took her out for a walk, a custom of his when he\nwished to say anything specially impressive.  Their way was over the\ntop of that lofty ridge dividing their woodland from the cider\ndistrict, whence they had in the spring beheld the miles of apple-trees\nin bloom.  All was now deep green.  The spot recalled to Grace's mind\nthe last occasion of her presence there, and she said, \"The promise of\nan enormous apple-crop is fulfilling itself, is it not?  I suppose\nGiles is getting his mills and presses ready.\"\n\nThis was just what her father had not come there to talk about. Without\nreplying he raised his arm, and moved his finger till he fixed it at a\npoint.  \"There,\" he said, \"you see that plantation reaching over the\nhill like a great slug, and just behind the hill a particularly green\nsheltered bottom?  That's where Mr. Fitzpiers's family were lords of\nthe manor for I don't know how many hundred years, and there stands the\nvillage of Buckbury Fitzpiers.  A wonderful property 'twas--wonderful!\"\n\n\"But they are not lords of the manor there now.\"\n\n\"Why, no.  But good and great things die as well as little and foolish.\nThe only ones representing the family now, I believe, are our doctor\nand a maiden lady living I don't know where.  You can't help being\nhappy, Grace, in allying yourself with such a romantical family.\nYou'll feel as if you've stepped into history.\"\n\n\"We've been at Hintock as long as they've been at Buckbury; is it not\nso? You say our name occurs in old deeds continually.\"\n\n\"Oh yes--as yeomen, copyholders, and such like.  But think how much\nbetter this will be for 'ee.  You'll be living a high intellectual\nlife, such as has now become natural to you; and though the doctor's\npractice is small here, he'll no doubt go to a dashing town when he's\ngot his hand in, and keep a stylish carriage, and you'll be brought to\nknow a good many ladies of excellent society.  If you should ever meet\nme then, Grace, you can drive past me, looking the other way.  I\nshouldn't expect you to speak to me, or wish such a thing, unless it\nhappened to be in some lonely, private place where 'twouldn't lower ye\nat all. Don't think such men as neighbor Giles your equal.  He and I\nshall be good friends enough, but he's not for the like of you.  He's\nlived our rough and homely life here, and his wife's life must be rough\nand homely likewise.\"\n\nSo much pressure could not but produce some displacement.  As Grace was\nleft very much to herself, she took advantage of one fine day before\nFitzpiers's return to drive into the aforesaid vale where stood the\nvillage of Buckbury Fitzpiers.  Leaving her father's man at the inn\nwith the horse and gig, she rambled onward to the ruins of a castle,\nwhich stood in a field hard by.  She had no doubt that it represented\nthe ancient stronghold of the Fitzpiers family.\n\nThe remains were few, and consisted mostly of remnants of the lower\nvaulting, supported on low stout columns surmounted by the crochet\ncapital of the period.  The two or three arches of these vaults that\nwere still in position were utilized by the adjoining farmer as shelter\nfor his calves, the floor being spread with straw, amid which the young\ncreatures rustled, cooling their thirsty tongues by licking the quaint\nNorman carving, which glistened with the moisture.  It was a\ndegradation of even such a rude form of art as this to be treatad so\ngrossly, she thought, and for the first time the family of Fitzpiers\nassumed in her imagination the hues of a melancholy romanticism.\n\nIt was soon time to drive home, and she traversed the distance with a\npreoccupied mind.  The idea of so modern a man in science and\naesthetics as the young surgeon springing out of relics so ancient was\na kind of novelty she had never before experienced. The combination\nlent him a social and intellectual interest which she dreaded, so much\nweight did it add to the strange influence he exercised upon her\nwhenever he came near her.\n\nIn an excitement which was not love, not ambition, rather a fearful\nconsciousness of hazard in the air, she awaited his return.\n\nMeanwhile her father was awaiting him also.  In his house there was an\nold work on medicine, published towards the end of the last century,\nand to put himself in harmony with events Melbury spread this work on\nhis knees when he had done his day's business, and read about Galen,\nHippocrates, and Herophilus--of the dogmatic, the empiric, the\nhermetical, and other sects of practitioners that have arisen in\nhistory; and thence proceeded to the classification of maladies and the\nrules for their treatment, as laid down in this valuable book with\nabsolute precision.  Melbury regretted that the treatise was so old,\nfearing that he might in consequence be unable to hold as complete a\nconversation as he could wish with Mr. Fitzpiers, primed, no doubt,\nwith more recent discoveries.\n\nThe day of Fitzpiers's return arrived, and he sent to say that he would\ncall immediately.  In the little time that was afforded for putting the\nhouse in order the sweeping of Melbury's parlor was as the sweeping of\nthe parlor at the Interpreter's which wellnigh choked the Pilgrim.  At\nthe end of it Mrs. Melbury sat down, folded her hands and lips, and\nwaited.  Her husband restlessly walked in and out from the timber-yard,\nstared at the interior of the room, jerked out \"ay, ay,\" and retreated\nagain.  Between four and five Fitzpiers arrived, hitching his horse to\nthe hook outside the door.\n\nAs soon as he had walked in and perceived that Grace was not in the\nroom, he seemed to have a misgiving.  Nothing less than her actual\npresence could long keep him to the level of this impassioned\nenterprise, and that lacking he appeared as one who wished to retrace\nhis steps.\n\nHe mechanically talked at what he considered a woodland matron's level\nof thought till a rustling was heard on the stairs, and Grace came in.\nFitzpiers was for once as agitated as she.  Over and above the genuine\nemotion which she raised in his heart there hung the sense that he was\ncasting a die by impulse which he might not have thrown by judgment.\n\nMr. Melbury was not in the room.  Having to attend to matters in the\nyard, he had delayed putting on his afternoon coat and waistcoat till\nthe doctor's appearance, when, not wishing to be backward in receiving\nhim, he entered the parlor hastily buttoning up those garments.\nGrace's fastidiousness was a little distressed that Fitzpiers should\nsee by this action the strain his visit was putting upon her father;\nand to make matters worse for her just then, old Grammer seemed to have\na passion for incessantly pumping in the back kitchen, leaving the\ndoors open so that the banging and splashing were distinct above the\nparlor conversation.\n\nWhenever the chat over the tea sank into pleasant desultoriness Mr.\nMelbury broke in with speeches of labored precision on very remote\ntopics, as if he feared to let Fitzpiers's mind dwell critically on the\nsubject nearest the hearts of all.  In truth a constrained manner was\nnatural enough in Melbury just now, for the greatest interest of his\nlife was reaching its crisis.  Could the real have been beheld instead\nof the corporeal merely, the corner of the room in which he sat would\nhave been filled with a form typical of anxious suspense, large-eyed,\ntight-lipped, awaiting the issue.  That paternal hopes and fears so\nintense should be bound up in the person of one child so peculiarly\ncircumstanced, and not have dispersed themselves over the larger field\nof a whole family, involved dangerous risks to future happiness.\n\nFitzpiers did not stay more than an hour, but that time had apparently\nadvanced his sentiments towards Grace, once and for all, from a vaguely\nliquescent to an organic shape.  She would not have accompanied him to\nthe door in response to his whispered \"Come!\" if her mother had not\nsaid in a matter-of-fact way, \"Of course, Grace; go to the door with\nMr. Fitzpiers.\"  Accordingly Grace went, both her parents remaining in\nthe room.  When the young pair were in the great brick-floored hall the\nlover took the girl's hand in his, drew it under his arm, and thus led\nher on to the door, where he stealthily kissed her.\n\nShe broke from him trembling, blushed and turned aside, hardly knowing\nhow things had advanced to this.  Fitzpiers drove off, kissing his hand\nto her, and waving it to Melbury who was visible through the window.\nHer father returned the surgeon's action with a great flourish of his\nown hand and a satisfied smile.\n\nThe intoxication that Fitzpiers had, as usual, produced in Grace's\nbrain during the visit passed off somewhat with his withdrawal. She\nfelt like a woman who did not know what she had been doing for the\nprevious hour, but supposed with trepidation that the afternoon's\nproceedings, though vague, had amounted to an engagement between\nherself and the handsome, coercive, irresistible Fitzpiers.\n\n\nThis visit was a type of many which followed it during the long summer\ndays of that year.  Grace was borne along upon a stream of reasonings,\narguments, and persuasions, supplemented, it must be added, by\ninclinations of her own at times.  No woman is without aspirations,\nwhich may be innocent enough within certain limits; and Grace had been\nso trained socially, and educated intellectually, as to see clearly\nenough a pleasure in the position of wife to such a man as Fitzpiers.\nHis material standing of itself, either present or future, had little\nin it to give her ambition, but the possibilities of a refined and\ncultivated inner life, of subtle psychological intercourse, had their\ncharm.  It was this rather than any vulgar idea of marrying well which\ncaused her to float with the current, and to yield to the immense\ninfluence which Fitzpiers exercised over her whenever she shared his\nsociety.\n\nAny observer would shrewdly have prophesied that whether or not she\nloved him as yet in the ordinary sense, she was pretty sure to do so in\ntime.\n\nOne evening just before dusk they had taken a rather long walk\ntogether, and for a short cut homeward passed through the shrubberies\nof Hintock House--still deserted, and still blankly confronting with\nits sightless shuttered windows the surrounding foliage and slopes.\nGrace was tired, and they approached the wall, and sat together on one\nof the stone sills--still warm with the sun that had been pouring its\nrays upon them all the afternoon.\n\n\"This place would just do for us, would it not, dearest,\" said her\nbetrothed, as they sat, turning and looking idly at the old facade.\n\n\"Oh yes,\" said Grace, plainly showing that no such fancy had ever\ncrossed her mind.  \"She is away from home still,\" Grace added in a\nminute, rather sadly, for she could not forget that she had somehow\nlost the valuable friendship of the lady of this bower.\n\n\"Who is?--oh, you mean Mrs. Charmond.  Do you know, dear, that at one\ntime I thought you lived here.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" said Grace.  \"How was that?\"\n\nHe explained, as far as he could do so without mentioning his\ndisappointment at finding it was otherwise; and then went on: \"Well,\nnever mind that.  Now I want to ask you something.  There is one detail\nof our wedding which I am sure you will leave to me. My inclination is\nnot to be married at the horrid little church here, with all the yokels\nstaring round at us, and a droning parson reading.\"\n\n\"Where, then, can it be?  At a church in town?\"\n\n\"No.  Not at a church at all.  At a registry office.  It is a quieter,\nsnugger, and more convenient place in every way.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said she, with real distress.  \"How can I be married except at\nchurch, and with all my dear friends round me?\"\n\n\"Yeoman Winterborne among them.\"\n\n\"Yes--why not? You know there was nothing serious between him and me.\"\n\n\"You see, dear, a noisy bell-ringing marriage at church has this\nobjection in our case: it would be a thing of report a long way round.\nNow I would gently, as gently as possible, indicate to you how\ninadvisable such publicity would be if we leave Hintock, and I purchase\nthe practice that I contemplate purchasing at Budmouth--hardly more\nthan twenty miles off.  Forgive my saying that it will be far better if\nnobody there knows where you come from, nor anything about your\nparents.  Your beauty and knowledge and manners will carry you anywhere\nif you are not hampered by such retrospective criticism.\"\n\n\"But could it not be a quiet ceremony, even at church?\" she pleaded.\n\n\"I don't see the necessity of going there!\" he said, a trifle\nimpatiently.  \"Marriage is a civil contract, and the shorter and\nsimpler it is made the better.  People don't go to church when they\ntake a house, or even when they make a will.\"\n\n\"Oh, Edgar--I don't like to hear you speak like that.\"\n\n\"Well, well--I didn't mean to.  But I have mentioned as much to your\nfather, who has made no objection; and why should you?\"\n\nShe gave way, deeming the point one on which she ought to allow\nsentiment to give way to policy--if there were indeed policy in his\nplan.  But she was indefinably depressed as they walked homeward.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\nHe left her at the door of her father's house.  As he receded, and was\nclasped out of sight by the filmy shades, he impressed Grace as a man\nwho hardly appertained to her existence at all. Cleverer, greater than\nherself, one outside her mental orbit, as she considered him, he seemed\nto be her ruler rather than her equal, protector, and dear familiar\nfriend.\n\nThe disappointment she had experienced at his wish, the shock given to\nher girlish sensibilities by his irreverent views of marriage, together\nwith the sure and near approach of the day fixed for committing her\nfuture to his keeping, made her so restless that she could scarcely\nsleep at all that night.  She rose when the sparrows began to walk out\nof the roof-holes, sat on the floor of her room in the dim light, and\nby-and-by peeped out behind the window-curtains.  It was even now day\nout-of-doors, though the tones of morning were feeble and wan, and it\nwas long before the sun would be perceptible in this overshadowed vale.\nNot a sound came from any of the out-houses as yet.  The tree-trunks,\nthe road, the out-buildings, the garden, every object wore that aspect\nof mesmeric fixity which the suspensive quietude of daybreak lends to\nsuch scenes.  Outside her window helpless immobility seemed to be\ncombined with intense consciousness; a meditative inertness possessed\nall things, oppressively contrasting with her own active emotions.\nBeyond the road were some cottage roofs and orchards; over these roofs\nand over the apple-trees behind, high up the slope, and backed by the\nplantation on the crest, was the house yet occupied by her future\nhusband, the rough-cast front showing whitely through its creepers.\nThe window-shutters were closed, the bedroom curtains closely drawn,\nand not the thinnest coil of smoke rose from the rugged chimneys.\n\nSomething broke the stillness.  The front door of the house she was\ngazing at opened softly, and there came out into the porch a female\nfigure, wrapped in a large shawl, beneath which was visible the white\nskirt of a long loose garment.  A gray arm, stretching from within the\nporch, adjusted the shawl over the woman's shoulders; it was withdrawn\nand disappeared, the door closing behind her.\n\nThe woman went quickly down the box-edged path between the raspberries\nand currants, and as she walked her well-developed form and gait\nbetrayed her individuality.  It was Suke Damson, the affianced one of\nsimple young Tim Tangs.  At the bottom of the garden she entered the\nshelter of the tall hedge, and only the top of her head could be seen\nhastening in the direction of her own dwelling.\n\nGrace had recognized, or thought she recognized, in the gray arm\nstretching from the porch, the sleeve of a dressing-gown which Mr.\nFitzpiers had been wearing on her own memorable visit to him.  Her face\nfired red.  She had just before thought of dressing herself and taking\na lonely walk under the trees, so coolly green this early morning; but\nshe now sat down on her bed and fell into reverie.  It seemed as if\nhardly any time had passed when she heard the household moving briskly\nabout, and breakfast preparing down-stairs; though, on rousing herself\nto robe and descend, she found that the sun was throwing his rays\ncompletely over the tree-tops, a progress of natural phenomena\ndenoting that at least three hours had elapsed since she last looked\nout of the window.\n\nWhen attired she searched about the house for her father; she found him\nat last in the garden, stooping to examine the potatoes for signs of\ndisease.  Hearing her rustle, he stood up and stretched his back and\narms, saying, \"Morning t'ye, Gracie.  I congratulate ye.  It is only a\nmonth to-day to the time!\"\n\nShe did not answer, but, without lifting her dress, waded between the\ndewy rows of tall potato-green into the middle of the plot where he was.\n\n\"I have been thinking very much about my position this morning--ever\nsince it was light,\" she began, excitedly, and trembling so that she\ncould hardly stand.  \"And I feel it is a false one.  I wish not to\nmarry Mr. Fitzpiers.  I wish not to marry anybody; but I'll marry Giles\nWinterborne if you say I must as an alternative.\"\n\nHer father's face settled into rigidity, he turned pale, and came\ndeliberately out of the plot before he answered her.  She had never\nseen him look so incensed before.\n\n\"Now, hearken to me,\" he said.  \"There's a time for a woman to alter\nher mind; and there's a time when she can no longer alter it, if she\nhas any right eye to her parents' honor and the seemliness of things.\nThat time has come.  I won't say to ye, you SHALL marry him.  But I\nwill say that if you refuse, I shall forever be ashamed and a-weary of\nye as a daughter, and shall look upon you as the hope of my life no\nmore.  What do you know about life and what it can bring forth, and how\nyou ought to act to lead up to best ends?  Oh, you are an ungrateful\nmaid, Grace; you've seen that fellow Giles, and he has got over ye;\nthat's where the secret lies, I'll warrant me!\"\n\n\"No, father, no! It is not Giles--it is something I cannot tell you\nof--\"\n\n\"Well, make fools of us all; make us laughing-stocks; break it off;\nhave your own way.\"\n\n\"But who knows of the engagement as yet? how can breaking it disgrace\nyou?\"\n\nMelbury then by degrees admitted that he had mentioned the engagement\nto this acquaintance and to that, till she perceived that in his\nrestlessness and pride he had published it everywhere. She went\ndismally away to a bower of laurel at the top of the garden.  Her\nfather followed her.\n\n\"It is that Giles Winterborne!\" he said, with an upbraiding gaze at her.\n\n\"No, it is not; though for that matter you encouraged him once,\" she\nsaid, troubled to the verge of despair.  \"It is not Giles, it is Mr.\nFitzpiers.\"\n\n\"You've had a tiff--a lovers' tiff--that's all, I suppose!\"\n\n\"It is some woman--\"\n\n\"Ay, ay; you are jealous.  The old story.  Don't tell me.  Now do you\nbide here.  I'll send Fitzpiers to you. I saw him smoking in front of\nhis house but a minute by-gone.\"\n\nHe went off hastily out of the garden-gate and down the lane.  But she\nwould not stay where she was; and edging through a slit in the\ngarden-fence, walked away into the wood.  Just about here the trees\nwere large and wide apart, and there was no undergrowth, so that she\ncould be seen to some distance; a sylph-like, greenish-white creature,\nas toned by the sunlight and leafage.  She heard a foot-fall crushing\ndead leaves behind her, and found herself reconnoitered by Fitzpiers\nhimself, approaching gay and fresh as the morning around them.\n\nHis remote gaze at her had been one of mild interest rather than of\nrapture.  But she looked so lovely in the green world about her, her\npink cheeks, her simple light dress, and the delicate flexibility of\nher movement acquired such rarity from their wild-wood setting, that\nhis eyes kindled as he drew near.\n\n\"My darling, what is it?  Your father says you are in the pouts, and\njealous, and I don't know what.  Ha! ha! ha! as if there were any rival\nto you, except vegetable nature, in this home of recluses! We know\nbetter.\"\n\n\"Jealous; oh no, it is not so,\" said she, gravely.  \"That's a mistake\nof his and yours, sir.  I spoke to him so closely about the question of\nmarriage with you that he did not apprehend my state of mind.\"\n\n\"But there's something wrong--eh?\" he asked, eying her narrowly, and\nbending to kiss her.  She shrank away, and his purposed kiss miscarried.\n\n\"What is it?\" he said, more seriously for this little defeat.\n\nShe made no answer beyond, \"Mr. Fitzpiers, I have had no breakfast, I\nmust go in.\"\n\n\"Come,\" he insisted, fixing his eyes upon her.  \"Tell me at once, I\nsay.\"\n\nIt was the greater strength against the smaller; but she was mastered\nless by his manner than by her own sense of the unfairness of silence.\n\"I looked out of the window,\" she said, with hesitation.  \"I'll tell\nyou by-and-by.  I must go in-doors. I have had no breakfast.\"\n\nBy a sort of divination his conjecture went straight to the fact. \"Nor\nI,\" said he, lightly.  \"Indeed, I rose late to-day.  I have had a\nbroken night, or rather morning.  A girl of the village--I don't know\nher name--came and rang at my bell as soon as it was light--between\nfour and five, I should think it was--perfectly maddened with an aching\ntooth.  As no-body heard her ring, she threw some gravel at my window,\ntill at last I heard her and slipped on my dressing-gown and went down.\nThe poor thing begged me with tears in her eyes to take out her\ntormentor, if I dragged her head off.  Down she sat and out it came--a\nlovely molar, not a speck upon it; and off she went with it in her\nhandkerchief, much contented, though it would have done good work for\nher for fifty years to come.\"\n\nIt was all so plausible--so completely explained.  Knowing nothing of\nthe incident in the wood on old Midsummer-eve, Grace felt that her\nsuspicions were unworthy and absurd, and with the readiness of an\nhonest heart she jumped at the opportunity of honoring his word.  At\nthe moment of her mental liberation the bushes about the garden had\nmoved, and her father emerged into the shady glade. \"Well, I hope it is\nmade up?\" he said, cheerily.\n\n\"Oh yes,\" said Fitzpiers, with his eyes fixed on Grace, whose eyes were\nshyly bent downward.\n\n\"Now,\" said her father, \"tell me, the pair of ye, that you still mean\nto take one another for good and all; and on the strength o't you shall\nhave another couple of hundred paid down.  I swear it by the name.\"\n\nFitzpiers took her hand.  \"We declare it, do we not, my dear Grace?\"\nsaid he.\n\nRelieved of her doubt, somewhat overawed, and ever anxious to please,\nshe was disposed to settle the matter; yet, womanlike, she would not\nrelinquish her opportunity of asking a concession of some sort.  \"If\nour wedding can be at church, I say yes,\" she answered, in a measured\nvoice.  \"If not, I say no.\"\n\nFitzpiers was generous in his turn.  \"It shall be so,\" he rejoined,\ngracefully.  \"To holy church we'll go, and much good may it do us.\"\n\nThey returned through the bushes indoors, Grace walking, full of\nthought between the other two, somewhat comforted, both by Fitzpiers's\ningenious explanation and by the sense that she was not to be deprived\nof a religious ceremony.  \"So let it be,\" she said to herself.  \"Pray\nGod it is for the best.\"\n\nFrom this hour there was no serious attempt at recalcitration on her\npart.  Fitzpiers kept himself continually near her, dominating any\nrebellious impulse, and shaping her will into passive concurrence with\nall his desires.  Apart from his lover-like anxiety to possess her, the\nfew golden hundreds of the timber-dealer, ready to hand, formed a warm\nbackground to Grace's lovely face, and went some way to remove his\nuneasiness at the prospect of endangering his professional and social\nchances by an alliance with the family of a simple countryman.\n\n\nThe interim closed up its perspective surely and silently. Whenever\nGrace had any doubts of her position, the sense of contracting time was\nlike a shortening chamber: at other moments she was comparatively\nblithe.  Day after day waxed and waned; the one or two woodmen who\nsawed, shaped, spokeshaved on her father's premises at this inactive\nseason of the year, regularly came and unlocked the doors in the\nmorning, locked them in the evening, supped, leaned over their\ngarden-gates for a whiff of evening air, and to catch any last and\nfarthest throb of news from the outer world, which entered and expired\nat Little Hintock like the exhausted swell of a wave in some innermost\ncavern of some innermost creek of an embayed sea; yet no news\ninterfered with the nuptial purpose at their neighbor's house.  The\nsappy green twig-tips of the season's growth would not, she thought,\nbe appreciably woodier on the day she became a wife, so near was the\ntime; the tints of the foliage would hardly have changed.  Everything\nwas so much as usual that no itinerant stranger would have supposed a\nwoman's fate to be hanging in the balance at that summer's decline.\n\nBut there were preparations, imaginable readily enough by those who had\nspecial knowledge.  In the remote and fashionable town of Sandbourne\nsomething was growing up under the hands of several persons who had\nnever seen Grace Melbury, never would see her, or care anything about\nher at all, though their creation had such interesting relation to her\nlife that it would enclose her very heart at a moment when that heart\nwould beat, if not with more emotional ardor, at least with more\nemotional turbulence than at any previous time.\n\nWhy did Mrs. Dollery's van, instead of passing along at the end of the\nsmaller village to Great Hintock direct, turn one Saturday night into\nLittle Hintock Lane, and never pull up till it reached Mr. Melbury's\ngates?  The gilding shine of evening fell upon a large, flat box not\nless than a yard square, and safely tied with cord, as it was handed\nout from under the tilt with a great deal of care.  But it was not\nheavy for its size; Mrs. Dollery herself carried it into the house.\nTim Tangs, the hollow-turner, Bawtree, Suke Damson, and others, looked\nknowing, and made remarks to each other as they watched its entrance.\nMelbury stood at the door of the timber-shed in the attitude of a man\nto whom such an arrival was a trifling domestic detail with which he\ndid not condescend to be concerned.  Yet he well divined the contents\nof that box, and was in truth all the while in a pleasant exaltation at\nthe proof that thus far, at any rate, no disappointment had supervened.\nWhile Mrs. Dollery remained--which was rather long, from her sense of\nthe importance of her errand--he went into the out-house; but as soon\nas she had had her say, been paid, and had rumbled away, he entered the\ndwelling, to find there what he knew he should find--his wife and\ndaughter in a flutter of excitement over the wedding-gown, just arrived\nfrom the leading dress-maker of Sandbourne watering-place aforesaid.\n\nDuring these weeks Giles Winterborne was nowhere to be seen or heard\nof.  At the close of his tenure in Hintock he had sold some of his\nfurniture, packed up the rest--a few pieces endeared by associations,\nor necessary to his occupation--in the house of a friendly neighbor,\nand gone away.  People said that a certain laxity had crept into his\nlife; that he had never gone near a church latterly, and had been\nsometimes seen on Sundays with unblacked boots, lying on his elbow\nunder a tree, with a cynical gaze at surrounding objects.  He was\nlikely to return to Hintock when the cider-making season came round,\nhis apparatus being stored there, and travel with his mill and press\nfrom village to village.\n\nThe narrow interval that stood before the day diminished yet. There was\nin Grace's mind sometimes a certain anticipative satisfaction, the\nsatisfaction of feeling that she would be the heroine of an hour;\nmoreover, she was proud, as a cultivated woman, to be the wife of a\ncultivated man.  It was an opportunity denied very frequently to young\nwomen in her position, nowadays not a few; those in whom parental\ndiscovery of the value of education has implanted tastes which parental\ncircles fail to gratify.  But what an attenuation was this cold pride\nof the dream of her youth, in which she had pictured herself walking in\nstate towards the altar, flushed by the purple light and bloom of her\nown passion, without a single misgiving as to the sealing of the bond,\nand fervently receiving as her due\n\n  \"The homage of a thousand hearts; the fond, deep love of one.\"\n\n\nEverything had been clear then, in imagination; now something was\nundefined.  She had little carking anxieties; a curious fatefulness\nseemed to rule her, and she experienced a mournful want of some one to\nconfide in.\n\nThe day loomed so big and nigh that her prophetic ear could, in fancy,\ncatch the noise of it, hear the murmur of the villagers as she came out\nof church, imagine the jangle of the three thin-toned Hintock bells.\nThe dialogues seemed to grow louder, and the ding-ding-dong of those\nthree crazed bells more persistent.  She awoke: the morning had come.\n\nFive hours later she was the wife of Fitzpiers.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\nThe chief hotel at Sherton-Abbas was an old stone-fronted inn with a\nyawning arch, under which vehicles were driven by stooping coachmen to\nback premises of wonderful commodiousness.  The windows to the street\nwere mullioned into narrow lights, and only commanded a view of the\nopposite houses; hence, perhaps, it arose that the best and most\nluxurious private sitting-room that the inn could afford over-looked\nthe nether parts of the establishment, where beyond the yard were to be\nseen gardens and orchards, now bossed, nay incrusted, with scarlet and\ngold fruit, stretching to infinite distance under a luminous lavender\nmist.  The time was early autumn,\n\n    \"When the fair apples, red as evening sky,\n    Do bend the tree unto the fruitful ground,\n     When juicy pears, and berries of black dye,\n    Do dance in air, and call the eyes around.\"\n\n\nThe landscape confronting the window might, indeed, have been part of\nthe identical stretch of country which the youthful Chatterton had in\nhis mind.\n\nIn this room sat she who had been the maiden Grace Melbury till the\nfinger of fate touched her and turned her to a wife.  It was two months\nafter the wedding, and she was alone.  Fitzpiers had walked out to see\nthe abbey by the light of sunset, but she had been too fatigued to\naccompany him.  They had reached the last stage of a long eight-weeks'\ntour, and were going on to Hintock that night.\n\nIn the yard, between Grace and the orchards, there progressed a scene\nnatural to the locality at this time of the year.  An apple-mill and\npress had been erected on the spot, to which some men were bringing\nfruit from divers points in mawn-baskets, while others were grinding\nthem, and others wringing down the pomace, whose sweet juice gushed\nforth into tubs and pails.  The superintendent of these proceedings, to\nwhom the others spoke as master, was a young yeoman of prepossessing\nmanner and aspect, whose form she recognized in a moment.  He had hung\nhis coat to a nail of the out-house wall, and wore his shirt-sleeves\nrolled up beyond his elbows, to keep them unstained while he rammed the\npomace into the bags of horse-hair.  Fragments of apple-rind had\nalighted upon the brim of his hat--probably from the bursting of a\nbag--while brown pips of the same fruit were sticking among the down\nupon his fine, round arms.\n\nShe realized in a moment how he had come there.  Down in the heart of\nthe apple country nearly every farmer kept up a cider-making apparatus\nand wring-house for his own use, building up the pomace in great straw\n\"cheeses,\" as they were called; but here, on the margin of Pomona's\nplain, was a debatable land neither orchard nor sylvan exclusively,\nwhere the apple produce was hardly sufficient to warrant each\nproprietor in keeping a mill of his own.  This was the field of the\ntravelling cider-maker.  His press and mill were fixed to wheels\ninstead of being set up in a cider-house; and with a couple of horses,\nbuckets, tubs, strainers, and an assistant or two, he wandered from\nplace to place, deriving very satisfactory returns for his trouble in\nsuch a prolific season as the present.\n\nThe back parts of the town were just now abounding with\napple-gatherings.  They stood in the yards in carts, baskets, and loose\nheaps; and the blue, stagnant air of autumn which hung over everything\nwas heavy with a sweet cidery smell.  Cakes of pomace lay against the\nwalls in the yellow sun, where they were drying to be used as fuel.\nYet it was not the great make of the year as yet; before the standard\ncrop came in there accumulated, in abundant times like this, a large\nsuperfluity of early apples, and windfalls from the trees of later\nharvest, which would not keep long.  Thus, in the baskets, and\nquivering in the hopper of the mill, she saw specimens of mixed dates,\nincluding the mellow countenances of streaked-jacks, codlins, costards,\nstubbards, ratheripes, and other well-known friends of her ravenous\nyouth.\n\nGrace watched the head-man with interest.  The slightest sigh escaped\nher.  Perhaps she thought of the day--not so far distant--when that\nfriend of her childhood had met her by her father's arrangement in this\nsame town, warm with hope, though diffident, and trusting in a promise\nrather implied than given.  Or she might have thought of days earlier\nyet--days of childhood--when her mouth was somewhat more ready to\nreceive a kiss from his than was his to bestow one.  However, all that\nwas over.  She had felt superior to him then, and she felt superior to\nhim now.\n\nShe wondered why he never looked towards her open window.  She did not\nknow that in the slight commotion caused by their arrival at the inn\nthat afternoon Winterborne had caught sight of her through the archway,\nhad turned red, and was continuing his work with more concentrated\nattention on the very account of his discovery. Robert Creedle, too,\nwho travelled with Giles, had been incidentally informed by the hostler\nthat Dr. Fitzpiers and his young wife were in the hotel, after which\nnews Creedle kept shaking his head and saying to himself, \"Ah!\" very\naudibly, between his thrusts at the screw of the cider-press.\n\n\"Why the deuce do you sigh like that, Robert?\" asked Winterborne, at\nlast.\n\n\"Ah, maister--'tis my thoughts--'tis my thoughts!...Yes, ye've lost a\nhundred load o' timber well seasoned; ye've lost five hundred pound in\ngood money; ye've lost the stone-windered house that's big enough to\nhold a dozen families; ye've lost your share of half a dozen good\nwagons and their horses--all lost!--through your letting slip she that\nwas once yer own!\"\n\n\"Good God, Creedle, you'll drive me mad!\" said Giles, sternly. \"Don't\nspeak of that any more!\"\n\nThus the subject had ended in the yard.  Meanwhile, the passive cause\nof all this loss still regarded the scene.  She was beautifully\ndressed; she was seated in the most comfortable room that the inn\nafforded; her long journey had been full of variety, and almost\nluxuriously performed--for Fitzpiers did not study economy where\npleasure was in question.  Hence it perhaps arose that Giles and all\nhis belongings seemed sorry and common to her for the moment--moving in\na plane so far removed from her own of late that she could scarcely\nbelieve she had ever found congruity therein.  \"No--I could never have\nmarried him!\" she said, gently shaking her head.  \"Dear father was\nright.  It would have been too coarse a life for me.\" And she looked at\nthe rings of sapphire and opal upon her white and slender fingers that\nhad been gifts from Fitzpiers.\n\nSeeing that Giles still kept his back turned, and with a little of the\nabove-described pride of life--easily to be understood, and possibly\nexcused, in a young, inexperienced woman who thought she had married\nwell--she said at last, with a smile on her lips, \"Mr. Winterborne!\"\n\nHe appeared to take no heed, and she said a second time, \"Mr.\nWinterborne!\"\n\nEven now he seemed not to hear, though a person close enough to him to\nsee the expression of his face might have doubted it; and she said a\nthird time, with a timid loudness, \"Mr. Winterborne! What, have you\nforgotten my voice?\" She remained with her lips parted in a welcoming\nsmile.\n\nHe turned without surprise, and came deliberately towards the window.\n\"Why do you call me?\" he said, with a sternness that took her\ncompletely unawares, his face being now pale.  \"Is it not enough that\nyou see me here moiling and muddling for my daily bread while you are\nsitting there in your success, that you can't refrain from opening old\nwounds by calling out my name?\"\n\nShe flushed, and was struck dumb for some moments; but she forgave his\nunreasoning anger, knowing so well in what it had its root. \"I am sorry\nI offended you by speaking,\" she replied, meekly. \"Believe me, I did\nnot intend to do that.  I could hardly sit here so near you without a\nword of recognition.\"\n\nWinterborne's heart had swollen big, and his eyes grown moist by this\ntime, so much had the gentle answer of that familiar voice moved him.\nHe assured her hurriedly, and without looking at her, that he was not\nangry.  He then managed to ask her, in a clumsy, constrained way, if\nshe had had a pleasant journey, and seen many interesting sights.  She\nspoke of a few places that she had visited, and so the time passed till\nhe withdrew to take his place at one of the levers which pulled round\nthe screw.\n\nForgotten her voice! Indeed, he had not forgotten her voice, as his\nbitterness showed.  But though in the heat of the moment he had\nreproached her keenly, his second mood was a far more tender one--that\nwhich could regard her renunciation of such as he as her glory and her\nprivilege, his own fidelity notwithstanding.  He could have declared\nwith a contemporary poet--\n\n           \"If I forget,\n   The salt creek may forget the ocean;\n            If I forget\n   The heart whence flows my heart's bright motion,\n   May I sink meanlier than the worst\n   Abandoned, outcast, crushed, accurst,\n            If I forget.\n\n            \"Though you forget,\n   No word of mine shall mar your pleasure;\n            Though you forget,\n   You filled my barren life with treasure,\n   You may withdraw the gift you gave;\n   You still are queen, I still am slave,\n            Though you forget.\"\n\n\nShe had tears in her eyes at the thought that she could not remind him\nof what he ought to have remembered; that not herself but the pressure\nof events had dissipated the dreams of their early youth. Grace was\nthus unexpectedly worsted in her encounter with her old friend.  She\nhad opened the window with a faint sense of triumph, but he had turned\nit into sadness; she did not quite comprehend the reason why.  In truth\nit was because she was not cruel enough in her cruelty.  If you have to\nuse the knife, use it, say the great surgeons; and for her own peace\nGrace should have contemned Winterborne thoroughly or not at all.  As\nit was, on closing the window an indescribable, some might have said\ndangerous, pity quavered in her bosom for him.\n\nPresently her husband entered the room, and told her what a wonderful\nsunset there was to be seen.\n\n\"I have not noticed it.  But I have seen somebody out there that we\nknow,\" she replied, looking into the court.\n\nFitzpiers followed the direction of her eyes, and said he did not\nrecognize anybody.\n\n\"Why, Mr. Winterborne--there he is, cider-making.  He combines that\nwith his other business, you know.\"\n\n\"Oh--that fellow,\" said Fitzpiers, his curiosity becoming extinct.\n\nShe, reproachfully: \"What, call Mr. Winterborne a fellow, Edgar? It is\ntrue I was just saying to myself that I never could have married him;\nbut I have much regard for him, and always shall.\"\n\n\"Well, do by all means, my dear one.  I dare say I am inhuman, and\nsupercilious, and contemptibly proud of my poor old ramshackle family;\nbut I do honestly confess to you that I feel as if I belonged to a\ndifferent species from the people who are working in that yard.\"\n\n\"And from me too, then.  For my blood is no better than theirs.\"\n\nHe looked at her with a droll sort of awakening.  It was, indeed, a\nstartling anomaly that this woman of the tribe without should be\nstanding there beside him as his wife, if his sentiments were as he had\nsaid.  In their travels together she had ranged so unerringly at his\nlevel in ideas, tastes, and habits that he had almost forgotten how his\nheart had played havoc with his principles in taking her to him.\n\n\"Ah YOU--you are refined and educated into something quite different,\"\nhe said, self-assuringly.\n\n\"I don't quite like to think that,\" she murmured with soft regret. \"And\nI think you underestimate Giles Winterborne.  Remember, I was brought\nup with him till I was sent away to school, so I cannot be radically\ndifferent.  At any rate, I don't feel so.  That is, no doubt, my fault,\nand a great blemish in me.  But I hope you will put up with it, Edgar.\"\n\nFitzpiers said that he would endeavor to do so; and as it was now\ngetting on for dusk, they prepared to perform the last stage of their\njourney, so as to arrive at Hintock before it grew very late.\n\nIn less than half an hour they started, the cider-makers in the yard\nhaving ceased their labors and gone away, so that the only sounds\naudible there now were the trickling of the juice from the tightly\nscrewed press, and the buzz of a single wasp, which had drunk itself so\ntipsy that it was unconscious of nightfall.  Grace was very cheerful at\nthe thought of being soon in her sylvan home, but Fitzpiers sat beside\nher almost silent.  An indescribable oppressiveness had overtaken him\nwith the near approach of the journey's end and the realities of life\nthat lay there.\n\n\"You don't say a word, Edgar,\" she observed.  \"Aren't you glad to get\nback? I am.\"\n\n\"You have friends here.  I have none.\"\n\n\"But my friends are yours.\"\n\n\"Oh yes--in that sense.\"\n\nThe conversation languished, and they drew near the end of Hintock\nLane.  It had been decided that they should, at least for a time, take\nup their abode in her father's roomy house, one wing of which was quite\nat their service, being almost disused by the Melburys. Workmen had\nbeen painting, papering, and whitewashing this set of rooms in the\nwedded pair's absence; and so scrupulous had been the timber-dealer\nthat there should occur no hitch or disappointment on their arrival,\nthat not the smallest detail remained undone. To make it all complete a\nground-floor room had been fitted up as a surgery, with an independent\nouter door, to which Fitzpiers's brass plate was screwed--for mere\nornament, such a sign being quite superfluous where everybody knew the\nlatitude and longitude of his neighbors for miles round.\n\nMelbury and his wife welcomed the twain with affection, and all the\nhouse with deference.  They went up to explore their rooms, that opened\nfrom a passage on the left hand of the staircase, the entrance to which\ncould be shut off on the landing by a door that Melbury had hung for\nthe purpose.  A friendly fire was burning in the grate, although it was\nnot cold.  Fitzpiers said it was too soon for any sort of meal, they\nonly having dined shortly before leaving Sherton-Abbas.  He would walk\nacross to his old lodging, to learn how his locum tenens had got on in\nhis absence.\n\nIn leaving Melbury's door he looked back at the house.  There was\neconomy in living under that roof, and economy was desirable, but in\nsome way he was dissatisfied with the arrangement; it immersed him so\ndeeply in son-in-lawship to Melbury.  He went on to his former\nresidence.  His deputy was out, and Fitzpiers fell into conversation\nwith his former landlady.\n\n\"Well, Mrs. Cox, what's the best news?\" he asked of her, with cheery\nweariness.\n\nShe was a little soured at losing by his marriage so profitable a\ntenant as the surgeon had proved to be during his residence under her\nroof; and the more so in there being hardly the remotest chance of her\ngetting such another settler in the Hintock solitudes.  \"'Tis what I\ndon't wish to repeat, sir; least of all to you,\" she mumbled.\n\n\"Never mind me, Mrs. Cox; go ahead.\"\n\n\"It is what people say about your hasty marrying, Dr. Fitzpiers.\nWhereas they won't believe you know such clever doctrines in physic as\nthey once supposed of ye, seeing as you could marry into Mr. Melbury's\nfamily, which is only Hintock-born, such as me.\"\n\n\"They are kindly welcome to their opinion,\" said Fitzpiers, not\nallowing himself to recognize that he winced.  \"Anything else?\"\n\n\"Yes; SHE'S come home at last.\"\n\n\"Who's she?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Charmond.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed!\" said Fitzpiers, with but slight interest.  \"I've never\nseen her.\"\n\n\"She has seen you, sir, whether or no.\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"Yes; she saw you in some hotel or street for a minute or two while you\nwere away travelling, and accidentally heard your name; and when she\nmade some remark about you, Miss Ellis--that's her maid--told her you\nwas on your wedding-tower with Mr. Melbury's daughter; and she said,\n'He ought to have done better than that. I fear he has spoiled his\nchances,' she says.\"\n\nFitzpiers did not talk much longer to this cheering housewife, and\nwalked home with no very brisk step.  He entered the door quietly, and\nwent straight up-stairs to the drawing-room extemporized for their use\nby Melbury in his and his bride's absence, expecting to find her there\nas he had left her.  The fire was burning still, but there were no\nlights.  He looked into the next apartment, fitted up as a little\ndining-room, but no supper was laid.  He went to the top of the stairs,\nand heard a chorus of voices in the timber-merchant's parlor below,\nGrace's being occasionally intermingled.\n\nDescending, and looking into the room from the door-way, he found quite\na large gathering of neighbors and other acquaintances, praising and\ncongratulating Mrs. Fitzpiers on her return, among them being the\ndairyman, Farmer Bawtree, and the master-blacksmith from Great Hintock;\nalso the cooper, the hollow-turner, the exciseman, and some others,\nwith their wives, who lived hard by. Grace, girl that she was, had\nquite forgotten her new dignity and her husband's; she was in the midst\nof them, blushing, and receiving their compliments with all the\npleasure of old-comradeship.\n\nFitzpiers experienced a profound distaste for the situation. Melbury\nwas nowhere in the room, but Melbury's wife, perceiving the doctor,\ncame to him.  \"We thought, Grace and I,\" she said, \"that as they have\ncalled, hearing you were come, we could do no less than ask them to\nsupper; and then Grace proposed that we should all sup together, as it\nis the first night of your return.\"\n\nBy this time Grace had come round to him.  \"Is it not good of them to\nwelcome me so warmly?\" she exclaimed, with tears of friendship in her\neyes.  \"After so much good feeling I could not think of our shutting\nourselves up away from them in our own dining-room.\"\n\n\"Certainly not--certainly not,\" said Fitzpiers; and he entered the room\nwith the heroic smile of a martyr.\n\nAs soon as they sat down to table Melbury came in, and seemed to see at\nonce that Fitzpiers would much rather have received no such\ndemonstrative reception.  He thereupon privately chid his wife for her\nforwardness in the matter.  Mrs. Melbury declared that it was as much\nGrace's doing as hers, after which there was no more to be said by that\nyoung woman's tender father.  By this time Fitzpiers was making the\nbest of his position among the wide-elbowed and genial company who sat\neating and drinking and laughing and joking around him; and getting\nwarmed himself by the good cheer, was obliged to admit that, after all,\nthe supper was not the least enjoyable he had ever known.\n\nAt times, however, the words about his having spoiled his\nopportunities, repeated to him as those of Mrs. Charmond, haunted him\nlike a handwriting on the wall.  Then his manner would become suddenly\nabstracted.  At one moment he would mentally put an indignant query why\nMrs. Charmond or any other woman should make it her business to have\nopinions about his opportunities; at another he thought that he could\nhardly be angry with her for taking an interest in the doctor of her\nown parish.  Then he would drink a glass of grog and so get rid of the\nmisgiving.  These hitches and quaffings were soon perceived by Grace as\nwell as by her father; and hence both of them were much relieved when\nthe first of the guests to discover that the hour was growing late rose\nand declared that he must think of moving homeward. At the words\nMelbury rose as alertly as if lifted by a spring, and in ten minutes\nthey were gone.\n\n\"Now, Grace,\" said her husband as soon as he found himself alone with\nher in their private apartments, \"we've had a very pleasant evening,\nand everybody has been very kind.  But we must come to an understanding\nabout our way of living here.  If we continue in these rooms there must\nbe no mixing in with your people below.  I can't stand it, and that's\nthe truth.\"\n\nShe had been sadly surprised at the suddenness of his distaste for\nthose old-fashioned woodland forms of life which in his courtship he\nhad professed to regard with so much interest.  But she assented in a\nmoment.\n\n\"We must be simply your father's tenants,\" he continued, \"and our\ngoings and comings must be as independent as if we lived elsewhere.\"\n\n\"Certainly, Edgar--I quite see that it must be so.\"\n\n\"But you joined in with all those people in my absence, without knowing\nwhether I should approve or disapprove.  When I came I couldn't help\nmyself at all.\"\n\nShe, sighing: \"Yes--I see I ought to have waited; though they came\nunexpectedly, and I thought I had acted for the best.\"\n\nThus the discussion ended, and the next day Fitzpiers went on his old\nrounds as usual.  But it was easy for so super-subtle an eye as his to\ndiscern, or to think he discerned, that he was no longer regarded as an\nextrinsic, unfathomed gentleman of limitless potentiality, scientific\nand social; but as Mr. Melbury's compeer, and therefore in a degree\nonly one of themselves.  The Hintock woodlandlers held with all the\nstrength of inherited conviction to the aristocratic principle, and as\nsoon as they had discovered that Fitzpiers was one of the old Buckbury\nFitzpierses they had accorded to him for nothing a touching of\nhat-brims, promptness of service, and deference of approach, which\nMelbury had to do without, though he paid for it over and over.  But\nnow, having proved a traitor to his own cause by this marriage,\nFitzpiers was believed in no more as a superior hedged by his own\ndivinity; while as doctor he began to be rated no higher than old\nJones, whom they had so long despised.\n\nHis few patients seemed in his two months' absence to have dwindled\nconsiderably in number, and no sooner had he returned than there came\nto him from the Board of Guardians a complaint that a pauper had been\nneglected by his substitute.  In a fit of pride Fitzpiers resigned his\nappointment as one of the surgeons to the union, which had been the\nnucleus of his practice here.\n\nAt the end of a fortnight he came in-doors one evening to Grace more\nbriskly than usual.  \"They have written to me again about that practice\nin Budmouth that I once negotiated for,\" he said to her.  \"The premium\nasked is eight hundred pounds, and I think that between your father and\nmyself it ought to be raised.  Then we can get away from this place\nforever.\"\n\nThe question had been mooted between them before, and she was not\nunprepared to consider it.  They had not proceeded far with the\ndiscussion when a knock came to the door, and in a minute Grammer ran\nup to say that a message had arrived from Hintock House requesting Dr.\nFitzpiers to attend there at once.  Mrs. Charmond had met with a slight\naccident through the overturning of her carriage.\n\n\"This is something, anyhow,\" said Fitzpiers, rising with an interest\nwhich he could not have defined.  \"I have had a presentiment that this\nmysterious woman and I were to be better acquainted.\"\n\nThe latter words were murmured to himself alone.\n\n\"Good-night,\" said Grace, as soon as he was ready.  \"I shall be asleep,\nprobably, when you return.\"\n\n\"Good-night,\" he replied, inattentively, and went down-stairs.  It was\nthe first time since their marriage that he had left her without a kiss.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\nWinterborne's house had been pulled down.  On this account his face had\nbeen seen but fitfully in Hintock; and he would probably have\ndisappeared from the place altogether but for his slight business\nconnection with Melbury, on whose premises Giles kept his cider-making\napparatus, now that he had no place of his own to stow it in.  Coming\nhere one evening on his way to a hut beyond the wood where he now\nslept, he noticed that the familiar brown-thatched pinion of his\npaternal roof had vanished from its site, and that the walls were\nlevelled.  In present circumstances he had a feeling for the spot that\nmight have been called morbid, and when he had supped in the hut\naforesaid he made use of the spare hour before bedtime to return to\nLittle Hintock in the twilight and ramble over the patch of ground on\nwhich he had first seen the day.\n\nHe repeated this evening visit on several like occasions.  Even in the\ngloom he could trace where the different rooms had stood; could mark\nthe shape of the kitchen chimney-corner, in which he had roasted apples\nand potatoes in his boyhood, cast his bullets, and burned his initials\non articles that did and did not belong to him.  The apple-trees still\nremained to show where the garden had been, the oldest of them even now\nretaining the crippled slant to north-east given them by the great\nNovember gale of 1824, which carried a brig bodily over the Chesil\nBank.  They were at present bent to still greater obliquity by the\nheaviness of their produce. Apples bobbed against his head, and in the\ngrass beneath he crunched scores of them as he walked.  There was\nnobody to gather them now.\n\nIt was on the evening under notice that, half sitting, half leaning\nagainst one of these inclined trunks, Winterborne had become lost in\nhis thoughts, as usual, till one little star after another had taken up\na position in the piece of sky which now confronted him where his walls\nand chimneys had formerly raised their outlines.  The house had jutted\nawkwardly into the road, and the opening caused by its absence was very\ndistinct.\n\nIn the silence the trot of horses and the spin of carriage-wheels\nbecame audible; and the vehicle soon shaped itself against the blank\nsky, bearing down upon him with the bend in the lane which here\noccurred, and of which the house had been the cause.  He could discern\nthe figure of a woman high up on the driving-seat of a phaeton, a groom\nbeing just visible behind.  Presently there was a slight scrape, then a\nscream.  Winterborne went across to the spot, and found the phaeton\nhalf overturned, its driver sitting on the heap of rubbish which had\nonce been his dwelling, and the man seizing the horses' heads.  The\nequipage was Mrs. Charmond's, and the unseated charioteer that lady\nherself.\n\nTo his inquiry if she were hurt she made some incoherent reply to the\neffect that she did not know.  The damage in other respects was little\nor none: the phaeton was righted, Mrs. Charmond placed in it, and the\nreins given to the servant.  It appeared that she had been deceived by\nthe removal of the house, imagining the gap caused by the demolition to\nbe the opening of the road, so that she turned in upon the ruins\ninstead of at the bend a few yards farther on.\n\n\"Drive home--drive home!\" cried the lady, impatiently; and they started\non their way.  They had not, however, gone many paces when, the air\nbeing still, Winterborne heard her say \"Stop; tell that man to call the\ndoctor--Mr. Fitzpiers--and send him on to the House.  I find I am hurt\nmore seriously than I thought.\"\n\nWinterborne took the message from the groom and proceeded to the\ndoctor's at once.  Having delivered it, he stepped back into the\ndarkness, and waited till he had seen Fitzpiers leave the door. He\nstood for a few minutes looking at the window which by its light\nrevealed the room where Grace was sitting, and went away under the\ngloomy trees.\n\n\nFitzpiers duly arrived at Hintock House, whose doors he now saw open\nfor the first time.  Contrary to his expectation there was visible no\nsign of that confusion or alarm which a serious accident to the\nmistress of the abode would have occasioned.  He was shown into a room\nat the top of the staircase, cosily and femininely draped, where, by\nthe light of the shaded lamp, he saw a woman of full round figure\nreclining upon a couch in such a position as not to disturb a pile of\nmagnificent hair on the crown of her head.  A deep purple dressing-gown\nformed an admirable foil to the peculiarly rich brown of her\nhair-plaits; her left arm, which was naked nearly up to the shoulder,\nwas thrown upward, and between the fingers of her right hand she held a\ncigarette, while she idly breathed from her plump lips a thin stream of\nsmoke towards the ceiling.\n\nThe doctor's first feeling was a sense of his exaggerated prevision in\nhaving brought appliances for a serious case; the next, something more\ncurious.  While the scene and the moment were new to him and\nunanticipated, the sentiment and essence of the moment were\nindescribably familiar.  What could be the cause of it? Probably a\ndream.\n\nMrs. Charmond did not move more than to raise her eyes to him, and he\ncame and stood by her.  She glanced up at his face across her brows and\nforehead, and then he observed a blush creep slowly over her decidedly\nhandsome cheeks.  Her eyes, which had lingered upon him with an\ninquiring, conscious expression, were hastily withdrawn, and she\nmechanically applied the cigarette again to her lips.\n\nFor a moment he forgot his errand, till suddenly arousing himself he\naddressed her, formally condoled with her, and made the usual\nprofessional inquiries about what had happened to her, and where she\nwas hurt.\n\n\"That's what I want you to tell me,\" she murmured, in tones of\nindefinable reserve.  \"I quite believe in you, for I know you are very\naccomplished, because you study so hard.\"\n\n\"I'll do my best to justify your good opinion,\" said the young man,\nbowing.  \"And none the less that I am happy to find the accident has\nnot been serious.\"\n\n\"I am very much shaken,\" she said.\n\n\"Oh yes,\" he replied; and completed his examination, which convinced\nhim that there was really nothing the matter with her, and more than\never puzzled him as to why he had been fetched, since she did not\nappear to be a timid woman.  \"You must rest a while, and I'll send\nsomething,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, I forgot,\" she returned.  \"Look here.\" And she showed him a little\nscrape on her arm--the full round arm that was exposed. \"Put some\ncourt-plaster on that, please.\"\n\nHe obeyed.  \"And now,\" she said, \"before you go I want to put a\nquestion to you.  Sit round there in front of me, on that low chair,\nand bring the candles, or one, to the little table.  Do you smoke? Yes?\nThat's right--I am learning.  Take one of these; and here's a light.\"\nShe threw a matchbox across.\n\nFitzpiers caught it, and having lit up, regarded her from his new\nposition, which, with the shifting of the candles, for the first time\nafforded him a full view of her face.  \"How many years have passed\nsince first we met!\" she resumed, in a voice which she mainly\nendeavored to maintain at its former pitch of composure, and eying him\nwith daring bashfulness.\n\n\"WE met, do you say?\"\n\nShe nodded.  \"I saw you recently at an hotel in London, when you were\npassing through, I suppose, with your bride, and I recognized you as\none I had met in my girlhood.  Do you remember, when you were studying\nat Heidelberg, an English family that was staying there, who used to\nwalk--\"\n\n\"And the young lady who wore a long tail of rare-colored hair--ah, I\nsee it before my eyes!--who lost her gloves on the Great Terrace--who\nwas going back in the dusk to find them--to whom I said, 'I'll go for\nthem,' and you said, 'Oh, they are not worth coming all the way up\nagain for.' I DO remember, and how very long we stayed talking there! I\nwent next morning while the dew was on the grass: there they lay--the\nlittle fingers sticking out damp and thin.  I see them now! I picked\nthem up, and then--\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I kissed them,\" he rejoined, rather shamefacedly.\n\n\"But you had hardly ever seen me except in the dusk?\"\n\n\"Never mind.  I was young then, and I kissed them.  I wondered how I\ncould make the most of my trouvaille, and decided that I would call at\nyour hotel with them that afternoon.  It rained, and I waited till next\nday.  I called, and you were gone.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered she, with dry melancholy.  \"My mother, knowing my\ndisposition, said she had no wish for such a chit as me to go falling\nin love with an impecunious student, and spirited me away to Baden.  As\nit is all over and past I'll tell you one thing: I should have sent you\na line passing warm had I known your name. That name I never knew till\nmy maid said, as you passed up the hotel stairs a month ago, 'There's\nDr. Fitzpiers.'\"\n\n\"Good Heaven!\" said Fitzpiers, musingly.  \"How the time comes back to\nme!  The evening, the morning, the dew, the spot.  When I found that\nyou really were gone it was as if a cold iron had been passed down my\nback.  I went up to where you had stood when I last saw you--I flung\nmyself on the grass, and--being not much more than a boy--my eyes were\nliterally blinded with tears.  Nameless, unknown to me as you were, I\ncouldn't forget your voice.\"\n\n\"For how long?\"\n\n\"Oh--ever so long.  Days and days.\"\n\n\"Days and days! ONLY days and days? Oh, the heart of a man! Days and\ndays!\"\n\n\"But, my dear madam, I had not known you more than a day or two. It was\nnot a full-blown love--it was the merest bud--red, fresh, vivid, but\nsmall.  It was a colossal passion in posse, a giant in embryo.  It\nnever matured.\"\n\n\"So much the better, perhaps.\"\n\n\"Perhaps.  But see how powerless is the human will against\npredestination.  We were prevented meeting; we have met.  One feature\nof the case remains the same amid many changes.  You are still rich,\nand I am still poor.  Better than that, you have (judging by your last\nremark) outgrown the foolish, impulsive passions of your early\ngirl-hood.  I have not outgrown mine.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said she, with vibrations of strong feeling in her\nwords.  \"I have been placed in a position which hinders such\noutgrowings.  Besides, I don't believe that the genuine subjects of\nemotion do outgrow them; I believe that the older such people get the\nworse they are.  Possibly at ninety or a hundred they may feel they are\ncured; but a mere threescore and ten won't do it--at least for me.\"\n\nHe gazed at her in undisguised admiration.  Here was a soul of souls!\n\n\"Mrs. Charmond, you speak truly,\" he exclaimed.  \"But you speak sadly\nas well.  Why is that?\"\n\n\"I always am sad when I come here,\" she said, dropping to a low tone\nwith a sense of having been too demonstrative.\n\n\"Then may I inquire why you came?\"\n\n\"A man brought me.  Women are always carried about like corks upon the\nwaves of masculine desires....I hope I have not alarmed you; but\nHintock has the curious effect of bottling up the emotions till one can\nno longer hold them; I am often obliged to fly away and discharge my\nsentiments somewhere, or I should die outright.\"\n\n\"There is very good society in the county for those who have the\nprivilege of entering it.\"\n\n\"Perhaps so.  But the misery of remote country life is that your\nneighbors have no toleration for difference of opinion and habit. My\nneighbors think I am an atheist, except those who think I am a Roman\nCatholic; and when I speak disrespectfully of the weather or the crops\nthey think I am a blasphemer.\"\n\nShe broke into a low musical laugh at the idea.\n\n\"You don't wish me to stay any longer?\" he inquired, when he found that\nshe remained musing.\n\n\"No--I think not.\"\n\n\"Then tell me that I am to be gone.\"\n\n\"Why? Cannot you go without?\"\n\n\"I may consult my own feelings only, if left to myself.\"\n\n\"Well, if you do, what then? Do you suppose you'll be in my way?\"\n\n\"I feared it might be so.\"\n\n\"Then fear no more.  But good-night.  Come to-morrow and see if I am\ngoing on right.  This renewal of acquaintance touches me.  I have\nalready a friendship for you.\"\n\n\"If it depends upon myself it shall last forever.\"\n\n\"My best hopes that it may.  Good-by.\"\n\nFitzpiers went down the stairs absolutely unable to decide whether she\nhad sent for him in the natural alarm which might have followed her\nmishap, or with the single view of making herself known to him as she\nhad done, for which the capsize had afforded excellent opportunity.\nOutside the house he mused over the spot under the light of the stars.\nIt seemed very strange that he should have come there more than once\nwhen its inhabitant was absent, and observed the house with a nameless\ninterest; that he should have assumed off-hand before he knew Grace\nthat it was here she lived; that, in short, at sundry times and seasons\nthe individuality of Hintock House should have forced itself upon him\nas appertaining to some existence with which he was concerned.\n\nThe intersection of his temporal orbit with Mrs. Charmond's for a day\nor two in the past had created a sentimental interest in her at the\ntime, but it had been so evanescent that in the ordinary onward roll of\naffairs he would scarce ever have recalled it again.  To find her here,\nhowever, in these somewhat romantic circumstances, magnified that\nby-gone and transitory tenderness to indescribable proportions.\n\nOn entering Little Hintock he found himself regarding it in a new\nway--from the Hintock House point of view rather than from his own and\nthe Melburys'.  The household had all gone to bed, and as he went\nup-stairs he heard the snore of the timber-merchant from his quarter of\nthe building, and turned into the passage communicating with his own\nrooms in a strange access of sadness.  A light was burning for him in\nthe chamber; but Grace, though in bed, was not asleep.  In a moment her\nsympathetic voice came from behind the curtains.\n\n\"Edgar, is she very seriously hurt?\"\n\nFitzpiers had so entirely lost sight of Mrs. Charmond as a patient that\nhe was not on the instant ready with a reply.\n\n\"Oh no,\" he said.  \"There are no bones broken, but she is shaken. I am\ngoing again to-morrow.\"\n\nAnother inquiry or two, and Grace said,\n\n\"Did she ask for me?\"\n\n\"Well--I think she did--I don't quite remember; but I am under the\nimpression that she spoke of you.\"\n\n\"Cannot you recollect at all what she said?\"\n\n\"I cannot, just this minute.\"\n\n\"At any rate she did not talk much about me?\" said Grace with\ndisappointment.\n\n\"Oh no.\"\n\n\"But you did, perhaps,\" she added, innocently fishing for a compliment.\n\n\"Oh yes--you may depend upon that!\" replied he, warmly, though scarcely\nthinking of what he was saying, so vividly was there present to his\nmind the personality of Mrs. Charmond.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\nThe doctor's professional visit to Hintock House was promptly repeated\nthe next day and the next.  He always found Mrs. Charmond reclining on\na sofa, and behaving generally as became a patient who was in no great\nhurry to lose that title.  On each occasion he looked gravely at the\nlittle scratch on her arm, as if it had been a serious wound.\n\nHe had also, to his further satisfaction, found a slight scar on her\ntemple, and it was very convenient to put a piece of black plaster on\nthis conspicuous part of her person in preference to gold-beater's\nskin, so that it might catch the eyes of the servants, and make his\npresence appear decidedly necessary, in case there should be any doubt\nof the fact.\n\n\"Oh--you hurt me!\" she exclaimed one day.\n\nHe was peeling off the bit of plaster on her arm, under which the\nscrape had turned the color of an unripe blackberry previous to\nvanishing altogether.  \"Wait a moment, then--I'll damp it,\" said\nFitzpiers.  He put his lips to the place and kept them there till the\nplaster came off easily.  \"It was at your request I put it on,\" said he.\n\n\"I know it,\" she replied.  \"Is that blue vein still in my temple that\nused to show there?  The scar must be just upon it.  If the cut had\nbeen a little deeper it would have spilt my hot blood indeed!\"\nFitzpiers examined so closely that his breath touched her tenderly, at\nwhich their eyes rose to an encounter--hers showing themselves as deep\nand mysterious as interstellar space.  She turned her face away\nsuddenly.  \"Ah! none of that! none of that--I cannot coquet with you!\"\nshe cried.  \"Don't suppose I consent to for one moment.  Our poor,\nbrief, youthful hour of love-making was too long ago to bear continuing\nnow.  It is as well that we should understand each other on that point\nbefore we go further.\"\n\n\"Coquet! Nor I with you.  As it was when I found the historic gloves,\nso it is now.  I might have been and may be foolish; but I am no\ntrifler.  I naturally cannot forget that little space in which I\nflitted across the field of your vision in those days of the past, and\nthe recollection opens up all sorts of imaginings.\"\n\n\"Suppose my mother had not taken me away?\" she murmured, her dreamy\neyes resting on the swaying tip of a distant tree.\n\n\"I should have seen you again.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"Then the fire would have burned higher and higher.  What would have\nimmediately followed I know not; but sorrow and sickness of heart at\nlast.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Well--that's the end of all love, according to Nature's law.  I can\ngive no other reason.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't speak like that,\" she exclaimed.  \"Since we are only\npicturing the possibilities of that time, don't, for pity's sake, spoil\nthe picture.\" Her voice sank almost to a whisper as she added, with an\nincipient pout upon her full lips, \"Let me think at least that if you\nhad really loved me at all seriously, you would have loved me for ever\nand ever!\"\n\n\"You are right--think it with all your heart,\" said he.  \"It is a\npleasant thought, and costs nothing.\"\n\nShe weighed that remark in silence a while.  \"Did you ever hear\nanything of me from then till now?\" she inquired.\n\n\"Not a word.\"\n\n\"So much the better.  I had to fight the battle of life as well as you.\nI may tell you about it some day.  But don't ever ask me to do it, and\nparticularly do not press me to tell you now.\"\n\nThus the two or three days that they had spent in tender acquaintance\non the romantic slopes above the Neckar were stretched out in\nretrospect to the length and importance of years; made to form a canvas\nfor infinite fancies, idle dreams, luxurious melancholies, and sweet,\nalluring assertions which could neither be proved nor disproved.  Grace\nwas never mentioned between them, but a rumor of his proposed domestic\nchanges somehow reached her ears.\n\n\"Doctor, you are going away,\" she exclaimed, confronting him with\naccusatory reproach in her large dark eyes no less than in her rich\ncooing voice.  \"Oh yes, you are,\" she went on, springing to her feet\nwith an air which might almost have been called passionate.  \"It is no\nuse denying it.  You have bought a practice at Budmouth.  I don't blame\nyou.  Nobody can live at Hintock--least of all a professional man who\nwants to keep abreast of recent discovery.  And there is nobody here to\ninduce such a one to stay for other reasons.  That's right, that's\nright--go away!\"\n\n\"But no, I have not actually bought the practice as yet, though I am\nindeed in treaty for it.  And, my dear friend, if I continue to feel\nabout the business as I feel at this moment--perhaps I may conclude\nnever to go at all.\"\n\n\"But you hate Hintock, and everybody and everything in it that you\ndon't mean to take away with you?\"\n\nFitzpiers contradicted this idea in his most vibratory tones, and she\nlapsed into the frivolous archness under which she hid passions of no\nmean strength--strange, smouldering, erratic passions, kept down like a\nstifled conflagration, but bursting out now here, now there--the only\ncertain element in their direction being its unexpectedness.  If one\nword could have expressed her it would have been Inconsequence.  She\nwas a woman of perversities, delighting in frequent contrasts.  She\nliked mystery, in her life, in her love, in her history.  To be fair to\nher, there was nothing in the latter which she had any great reason to\nbe ashamed of, and many things of which she might have been proud; but\nit had never been fathomed by the honest minds of Hintock, and she\nrarely volunteered her experiences.  As for her capricious nature, the\npeople on her estates grew accustomed to it, and with that marvellous\nsubtlety of contrivance in steering round odd tempers, that is found in\nsons of the soil and dependants generally, they managed to get along\nunder her government rather better than they would have done beneath a\nmore equable rule.\n\nNow, with regard to the doctor's notion of leaving Hintock, he had\nadvanced further towards completing the purchase of the Budmouth\nsurgeon's good-will than he had admitted to Mrs. Charmond.  The whole\nmatter hung upon what he might do in the ensuing twenty-four hours.\nThe evening after leaving her he went out into the lane, and walked and\npondered between the high hedges, now greenish-white with wild\nclematis--here called \"old-man's beard,\" from its aspect later in the\nyear.\n\nThe letter of acceptance was to be written that night, after which his\ndeparture from Hintock would be irrevocable.  But could he go away,\nremembering what had just passed? The trees, the hills, the leaves, the\ngrass--each had been endowed and quickened with a subtle charm since he\nhad discovered the person and history, and, above all, mood of their\nowner.  There was every temporal reason for leaving; it would be\nentering again into a world which he had only quitted in a passion for\nisolation, induced by a fit of Achillean moodiness after an imagined\nslight.  His wife herself saw the awkwardness of their position here,\nand cheerfully welcomed the purposed change, towards which every step\nhad been taken but the last.  But could he find it in his heart--as he\nfound it clearly enough in his conscience--to go away?\n\nHe drew a troubled breath, and went in-doors.  Here he rapidly penned a\nletter, wherein he withdrew once for all from the treaty for the\nBudmouth practice.  As the postman had already left Little Hintock for\nthat night, he sent one of Melbury's men to intercept a mail-cart on\nanother turnpike-road, and so got the letter off.\n\nThe man returned, met Fitzpiers in the lane, and told him the thing was\ndone.  Fitzpiers went back to his house musing.  Why had he carried out\nthis impulse--taken such wild trouble to effect a probable injury to\nhis own and his young wife's prospects? His motive was fantastic,\nglowing, shapeless as the fiery scenery about the western sky.  Mrs.\nCharmond could overtly be nothing more to him than a patient now, and\nto his wife, at the outside, a patron.  In the unattached bachelor days\nof his first sojourning here how highly proper an emotional reason for\nlingering on would have appeared to troublesome dubiousness.\nMatrimonial ambition is such an honorable thing.\n\n\"My father has told me that you have sent off one of the men with a\nlate letter to Budmouth,\" cried Grace, coming out vivaciously to meet\nhim under the declining light of the sky, wherein hung, solitary, the\nfolding star.  \"I said at once that you had finally agreed to pay the\npremium they ask, and that the tedious question had been settled.  When\ndo we go, Edgar?\"\n\n\"I have altered my mind,\" said he.  \"They want too much--seven hundred\nand fifty is too large a sum--and in short, I have declined to go\nfurther.  We must wait for another opportunity.  I fear I am not a good\nbusiness-man.\" He spoke the last words with a momentary faltering at\nthe great foolishness of his act; for, as he looked in her fair and\nhonorable face, his heart reproached him for what he had done.\n\nHer manner that evening showed her disappointment.  Personally she\nliked the home of her childhood much, and she was not ambitious. But\nher husband had seemed so dissatisfied with the circumstances hereabout\nsince their marriage that she had sincerely hoped to go for his sake.\n\nIt was two or three days before he visited Mrs. Charmond again. The\nmorning had been windy, and little showers had sowed themselves like\ngrain against the walls and window-panes of the Hintock cottages.  He\nwent on foot across the wilder recesses of the park, where slimy\nstreams of green moisture, exuding from decayed holes caused by old\namputations, ran down the bark of the oaks and elms, the rind below\nbeing coated with a lichenous wash as green as emerald.  They were\nstout-trunked trees, that never rocked their stems in the fiercest\ngale, responding to it entirely by crooking their limbs.  Wrinkled like\nan old crone's face, and antlered with dead branches that rose above\nthe foliage of their summits, they were nevertheless still\ngreen--though yellow had invaded the leaves of other trees.\n\nShe was in a little boudoir or writing-room on the first floor, and\nFitzpiers was much surprised to find that the window-curtains were\nclosed and a red-shaded lamp and candles burning, though out-of-doors\nit was broad daylight.  Moreover, a large fire was burning in the\ngrate, though it was not cold.\n\n\"What does it all mean?\" he asked.\n\nShe sat in an easy-chair, her face being turned away.  \"Oh,\" she\nmurmured, \"it is because the world is so dreary outside.  Sorrow and\nbitterness in the sky, and floods of agonized tears beating against the\npanes.  I lay awake last night, and I could hear the scrape of snails\ncreeping up the window-glass; it was so sad! My eyes were so heavy this\nmorning that I could have wept my life away.  I cannot bear you to see\nmy face; I keep it away from you purposely.  Oh! why were we given\nhungry hearts and wild desires if we have to live in a world like this?\nWhy should Death only lend what Life is compelled to borrow--rest?\nAnswer that, Dr. Fitzpiers.\"\n\n\"You must eat of a second tree of knowledge before you can do it,\nFelice Charmond.\"\n\n\"Then, when my emotions have exhausted themselves, I become full of\nfears, till I think I shall die for very fear.  The terrible\ninsistencies of society--how severe they are, and cold and\ninexorable--ghastly towards those who are made of wax and not of stone.\nOh, I am afraid of them; a stab for this error, and a stab for\nthat--correctives and regulations framed that society may tend to\nperfection--an end which I don't care for in the least.  Yet for this,\nall I do care for has to be stunted and starved.\"\n\nFitzpiers had seated himself near her.  \"What sets you in this mournful\nmood?\" he asked, gently.  (In reality he knew that it was the result of\na loss of tone from staying in-doors so much, but he did not say so.)\n\n\"My reflections.  Doctor, you must not come here any more.  They begin\nto think it a farce already.  I say you must come no more. There--don't\nbe angry with me;\" and she jumped up, pressed his hand, and looked\nanxiously at him.  \"It is necessary.  It is best for both you and me.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Fitzpiers, gloomily, \"what have we done?\"\n\n\"Done--we have done nothing.  Perhaps we have thought the more.\nHowever, it is all vexation.  I am going away to Middleton Abbey, near\nShottsford, where a relative of my late husband lives, who is confined\nto her bed.  The engagement was made in London, and I can't get out of\nit.  Perhaps it is for the best that I go there till all this is past.\nWhen are you going to enter on your new practice, and leave Hintock\nbehind forever, with your pretty wife on your arm?\"\n\n\"I have refused the opportunity.  I love this place too well to depart.\"\n\n\"You HAVE?\" she said, regarding him with wild uncertainty.\n\"Why do you ruin yourself in that way?  Great Heaven, what have I done!\"\n\n\"Nothing.  Besides, you are going away.\"\n\n\"Oh yes; but only to Middleton Abbey for a month or two.  Yet perhaps I\nshall gain strength there--particularly strength of mind--I require it.\nAnd when I come back I shall be a new woman; and you can come and see\nme safely then, and bring your wife with you, and we'll be friends--she\nand I.  Oh, how this shutting up of one's self does lead to indulgence\nin idle sentiments.  I shall not wish you to give your attendance to me\nafter to-day.  But I am glad that you are not going away--if your\nremaining does not injure your prospects at all.\"\n\nAs soon as he had left the room the mild friendliness she had preserved\nin her tone at parting, the playful sadness with which she had\nconversed with him, equally departed from her.  She became as heavy as\nlead--just as she had been before he arrived.  Her whole being seemed\nto dissolve in a sad powerlessness to do anything, and the sense of it\nmade her lips tremulous and her closed eyes wet.  His footsteps again\nstartled her, and she turned round.\n\n\"I returned for a moment to tell you that the evening is going to be\nfine.  The sun is shining; so do open your curtains and put out those\nlights.  Shall I do it for you?\"\n\n\"Please--if you don't mind.\"\n\nHe drew back the window-curtains, whereupon the red glow of the lamp\nand the two candle-flames became almost invisible with the flood of\nlate autumn sunlight that poured in.  \"Shall I come round to you?\" he\nasked, her back being towards him.\n\n\"No,\" she replied.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because I am crying, and I don't want to see you.\"\n\nHe stood a moment irresolute, and regretted that he had killed the\nrosy, passionate lamplight by opening the curtains and letting in\ngarish day.\n\n\"Then I am going,\" he said.\n\n\"Very well,\" she answered, stretching one hand round to him, and\npatting her eyes with a handkerchief held in the other.\n\n\"Shall I write a line to you at--\"\n\n\"No, no.\" A gentle reasonableness came into her tone as she added, \"It\nmust not be, you know.  It won't do.\"\n\n\"Very well.  Good-by.\" The next moment he was gone.\n\nIn the evening, with listless adroitness, she encouraged the maid who\ndressed her for dinner to speak of Dr. Fitzpiers's marriage.\n\n\"Mrs. Fitzpiers was once supposed to favor Mr. Winterborne,\" said the\nyoung woman.\n\n\"And why didn't she marry him?\" said Mrs. Charmond.\n\n\"Because, you see, ma'am, he lost his houses.\"\n\n\"Lost his houses? How came he to do that?\"\n\n\"The houses were held on lives, and the lives dropped, and your agent\nwouldn't renew them, though it is said that Mr. Winterborne had a very\ngood claim.  That's as I've heard it, ma'am, and it was through it that\nthe match was broke off.\"\n\nBeing just then distracted by a dozen emotions, Mrs. Charmond sunk into\na mood of dismal self-reproach.  \"In refusing that poor man his\nreasonable request,\" she said to herself, \"I foredoomed my rejuvenated\ngirlhood's romance.  Who would have thought such a business matter\ncould have nettled my own heart like this? Now for a winter of regrets\nand agonies and useless wishes, till I forget him in the spring.  Oh! I\nam glad I am going away.\"\n\nShe left her chamber and went down to dine with a sigh.  On the stairs\nshe stood opposite the large window for a moment, and looked out upon\nthe lawn.  It was not yet quite dark.  Half-way up the steep green\nslope confronting her stood old Timothy Tangs, who was shortening his\nway homeward by clambering here where there was no road, and in\nopposition to express orders that no path was to be made there.  Tangs\nhad momentarily stopped to take a pinch of snuff; but observing Mrs.\nCharmond gazing at him, he hastened to get over the top out of hail.\nHis precipitancy made him miss his footing, and he rolled like a barrel\nto the bottom, his snuffbox rolling in front of him.\n\nHer indefinite, idle, impossible passion for Fitzpiers; her\nconstitutional cloud of misery; the sorrowful drops that still hung\nupon her eyelashes, all made way for the incursive mood started by the\nspectacle.  She burst into an immoderate fit of laughter, her very\ngloom of the previous hour seeming to render it the more\nuncontrollable.  It had not died out of her when she reached the\ndining-room; and even here, before the servants, her shoulders suddenly\nshook as the scene returned upon her; and the tears of her hilarity\nmingled with the remnants of those engendered by her grief.\n\nShe resolved to be sad no more.  She drank two glasses of champagne,\nand a little more still after those, and amused herself in the evening\nwith singing little amatory songs.\n\n\"I must do something for that poor man Winterborne, however,\" she said.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\n\nA week had passed, and Mrs. Charmond had left Hintock House. Middleton\nAbbey, the place of her sojourn, was about twenty miles distant by\nroad, eighteen by bridle-paths and footways.\n\nGrace observed, for the first time, that her husband was restless, that\nat moments he even was disposed to avoid her.  The scrupulous civility\nof mere acquaintanceship crept into his manner; yet, when sitting at\nmeals, he seemed hardly to hear her remarks.  Her little doings\ninterested him no longer, while towards her father his bearing was not\nfar from supercilious.  It was plain that his mind was entirely outside\nher life, whereabouts outside it she could not tell; in some region of\nscience, possibly, or of psychological literature.  But her hope that\nhe was again immersing himself in those lucubrations which before her\nmarriage had made his light a landmark in Hintock, was founded simply\non the slender fact that he often sat up late.\n\nOne evening she discovered him leaning over a gate on Rub-Down Hill,\nthe gate at which Winterborne had once been standing, and which opened\non the brink of a steep, slanting down directly into Blackmoor Vale, or\nthe Vale of the White Hart, extending beneath the eye at this point to\na distance of many miles.  His attention was fixed on the landscape far\naway, and Grace's approach was so noiseless that he did not hear her.\nWhen she came close she could see his lips moving unconsciously, as to\nsome impassioned visionary theme.\n\nShe spoke, and Fitzpiers started.  \"What are you looking at?\" she asked.\n\n\"Oh! I was contemplating our old place of Buckbury, in my idle way,\" he\nsaid.\n\nIt had seemed to her that he was looking much to the right of that\ncradle and tomb of his ancestral dignity; but she made no further\nobservation, and taking his arm walked home beside him almost in\nsilence.  She did not know that Middleton Abbey lay in the direction of\nhis gaze.  \"Are you going to have out Darling this afternoon?\" she\nasked, presently.  Darling being the light-gray mare which Winterborne\nhad bought for Grace, and which Fitzpiers now constantly used, the\nanimal having turned out a wonderful bargain, in combining a perfect\ndocility with an almost human intelligence; moreover, she was not too\nyoung.  Fitzpiers was unfamiliar with horses, and he valued these\nqualities.\n\n\"Yes,\" he replied, \"but not to drive.  I am riding her.  I practise\ncrossing a horse as often as I can now, for I find that I can take much\nshorter cuts on horseback.\"\n\nHe had, in fact, taken these riding exercises for about a week, only\nsince Mrs. Charmond's absence, his universal practice hitherto having\nbeen to drive.\n\nSome few days later, Fitzpiers started on the back of this horse to see\na patient in the aforesaid Vale.  It was about five o'clock in the\nevening when he went away, and at bedtime he had not reached home.\nThere was nothing very singular in this, though she was not aware that\nhe had any patient more than five or six miles distant in that\ndirection.  The clock had struck one before Fitzpiers entered the\nhouse, and he came to his room softly, as if anxious not to disturb her.\n\nThe next morning she was stirring considerably earlier than he.\n\nIn the yard there was a conversation going on about the mare; the man\nwho attended to the horses, Darling included, insisted that the latter\nwas \"hag-rid;\" for when he had arrived at the stable that morning she\nwas in such a state as no horse could be in by honest riding.  It was\ntrue that the doctor had stabled her himself when he got home, so that\nshe was not looked after as she would have been if he had groomed and\nfed her; but that did not account for the appearance she presented, if\nMr. Fitzpiers's journey had been only where he had stated.  The\nphenomenal exhaustion of Darling, as thus related, was sufficient to\ndevelop a whole series of tales about riding witches and demons, the\nnarration of which occupied a considerable time.\n\nGrace returned in-doors.  In passing through the outer room she picked\nup her husband's overcoat which he had carelessly flung down across a\nchair.  A turnpike ticket fell out of the breast-pocket, and she saw\nthat it had been issued at Middleton Gate.  He had therefore visited\nMiddleton the previous night, a distance of at least five-and-thirty\nmiles on horseback, there and back.\n\nDuring the day she made some inquiries, and learned for the first time\nthat Mrs. Charmond was staying at Middleton Abbey.  She could not\nresist an inference--strange as that inference was.\n\nA few days later he prepared to start again, at the same time and in\nthe same direction.  She knew that the state of the cottager who lived\nthat way was a mere pretext; she was quite sure he was going to Mrs.\nCharmond.  Grace was amazed at the mildness of the passion which the\nsuspicion engendered in her.  She was but little excited, and her\njealousy was languid even to death.  It told tales of the nature of her\naffection for him.  In truth, her antenuptial regard for Fitzpiers had\nbeen rather of the quality of awe towards a superior being than of\ntender solicitude for a lover.  It had been based upon mystery and\nstrangeness--the mystery of his past, of his knowledge, of his\nprofessional skill, of his beliefs.  When this structure of ideals was\ndemolished by the intimacy of common life, and she found him as merely\nhuman as the Hintock people themselves, a new foundation was in demand\nfor an enduring and stanch affection--a sympathetic interdependence,\nwherein mutual weaknesses were made the grounds of a defensive\nalliance.  Fitzpiers had furnished none of that single-minded\nconfidence and truth out of which alone such a second union could\nspring; hence it was with a controllable emotion that she now watched\nthe mare brought round.\n\n\"I'll walk with you to the hill if you are not in a great hurry,\" she\nsaid, rather loath, after all, to let him go.\n\n\"Do; there's plenty of time,\" replied her husband.  Accordingly he led\nalong the horse, and walked beside her, impatient enough nevertheless.\nThus they proceeded to the turnpike road, and ascended Rub-Down Hill to\nthe gate he had been leaning over when she surprised him ten days\nbefore.  This was the end of her excursion.  Fitzpiers bade her adieu\nwith affection, even with tenderness, and she observed that he looked\nweary-eyed.\n\n\"Why do you go to-night?\" she said.  \"You have been called up two\nnights in succession already.\"\n\n\"I must go,\" he answered, almost gloomily.  \"Don't wait up for me.\"\nWith these words he mounted his horse, passed through the gate which\nGrace held open for him, and ambled down the steep bridle-track to the\nvalley.\n\nShe closed the gate and watched his descent, and then his journey\nonward.  His way was east, the evening sun which stood behind her back\nbeaming full upon him as soon as he got out from the shade of the hill.\nNotwithstanding this untoward proceeding she was determined to be loyal\nif he proved true; and the determination to love one's best will carry\na heart a long way towards making that best an ever-growing thing.  The\nconspicuous coat of the active though blanching mare made horse and\nrider easy objects for the vision.  Though Darling had been chosen with\nsuch pains by Winterborne for Grace, she had never ridden the sleek\ncreature; but her husband had found the animal exceedingly convenient,\nparticularly now that he had taken to the saddle, plenty of staying\npower being left in Darling yet.  Fitzpiers, like others of his\ncharacter, while despising Melbury and his station, did not at all\ndisdain to spend Melbury's money, or appropriate to his own use the\nhorse which belonged to Melbury's daughter.\n\nAnd so the infatuated young surgeon went along through the gorgeous\nautumn landscape of White Hart Vale, surrounded by orchards lustrous\nwith the reds of apple-crops, berries, and foliage, the whole\nintensified by the gilding of the declining sun.  The earth this year\nhad been prodigally bountiful, and now was the supreme moment of her\nbounty.  In the poorest spots the hedges were bowed with haws and\nblackberries; acorns cracked underfoot, and the burst husks of\nchestnuts lay exposing their auburn contents as if arranged by anxious\nsellers in a fruit-market.  In all this proud show some kernels were\nunsound as her own situation, and she wondered if there were one world\nin the universe where the fruit had no worm, and marriage no sorrow.\n\nHerr Tannhauser still moved on, his plodding steed rendering him\ndistinctly visible yet.  Could she have heard Fitzpiers's voice at that\nmoment she would have found him murmuring--\n\n    \"...Towards the loadstar of my one desire\n     I flitted, even as a dizzy moth in the owlet light.\"\n\n\nBut he was a silent spectacle to her now.  Soon he rose out of the\nvalley, and skirted a high plateau of the chalk formation on his right,\nwhich rested abruptly upon the fruity district of loamy clay, the\ncharacter and herbage of the two formations being so distinct that the\ncalcareous upland appeared but as a deposit of a few years' antiquity\nupon the level vale.  He kept along the edge of this high, unenclosed\ncountry, and the sky behind him being deep violet, she could still see\nwhite Darling in relief upon it--a mere speck now--a Wouvermans\neccentricity reduced to microscopic dimensions.  Upon this high ground\nhe gradually disappeared.\n\nThus she had beheld the pet animal purchased for her own use, in pure\nlove of her, by one who had always been true, impressed to convey her\nhusband away from her to the side of a new-found idol. While she was\nmusing on the vicissitudes of horses and wives, she discerned shapes\nmoving up the valley towards her, quite near at hand, though till now\nhidden by the hedges.  Surely they were Giles Winterborne, with his two\nhorses and cider-apparatus, conducted by Robert Creedle.  Up, upward\nthey crept, a stray beam of the sun alighting every now and then like a\nstar on the blades of the pomace-shovels, which had been converted to\nsteel mirrors by the action of the malic acid.  She opened the gate\nwhen he came close, and the panting horses rested as they achieved the\nascent.\n\n\"How do you do, Giles?\" said she, under a sudden impulse to be familiar\nwith him.\n\nHe replied with much more reserve.  \"You are going for a walk, Mrs.\nFitzpiers?\" he added.  \"It is pleasant just now.\"\n\n\"No, I am returning,\" said she.\n\nThe vehicles passed through, the gate slammed, and Winterborne walked\nby her side in the rear of the apple-mill.\n\nHe looked and smelt like Autumn's very brother, his face being sunburnt\nto wheat-color, his eyes blue as corn-flowers, his boots and leggings\ndyed with fruit-stains, his hands clammy with the sweet juice of\napples, his hat sprinkled with pips, and everywhere about him that\natmosphere of cider which at its first return each season has such an\nindescribable fascination for those who have been born and bred among\nthe orchards.  Her heart rose from its late sadness like a released\nspring; her senses revelled in the sudden lapse back to nature\nunadorned.  The consciousness of having to be genteel because of her\nhusband's profession, the veneer of artificiality which she had\nacquired at the fashionable schools, were thrown off, and she became\nthe crude, country girl of her latent, earliest instincts.\n\nNature was bountiful, she thought.  No sooner had she been starved off\nby Edgar Fitzpiers than another being, impersonating bare and undiluted\nmanliness, had arisen out of the earth, ready to hand. This was an\nexcursion of the imagination which she did not encourage, and she said\nsuddenly, to disguise the confused regard which had followed her\nthoughts, \"Did you meet my husband?\"\n\nWinterborne, with some hesitation, \"Yes.\"\n\n\"Where did you meet him?\"\n\n\"At Calfhay Cross.  I come from Middleton Abbey; I have been making\nthere for the last week.\"\n\n\"Haven't they a mill of their own?\"\n\n\"Yes, but it's out of repair.\"\n\n\"I think--I heard that Mrs. Charmond had gone there to stay?\"\n\n\"Yes.  I have seen her at the windows once or twice.\"\n\nGrace waited an interval before she went on: \"Did Mr. Fitzpiers take\nthe way to Middleton?\"\n\n\"Yes...I met him on Darling.\" As she did not reply, he added, with a\ngentler inflection, \"You know why the mare was called that?\"\n\n\"Oh yes--of course,\" she answered, quickly.\n\nThey had risen so far over the crest of the hill that the whole west\nsky was revealed.  Between the broken clouds they could see far into\nthe recesses of heaven, the eye journeying on under a species of golden\narcades, and past fiery obstructions, fancied cairns, logan-stones,\nstalactites and stalagmite of topaz.  Deeper than this their gaze\npassed thin flakes of incandescence, till it plunged into a bottomless\nmedium of soft green fire.\n\nHer abandonment to the luscious time after her sense of ill-usage, her\nrevolt for the nonce against social law, her passionate desire for\nprimitive life, may have showed in her face.  Winterborne was looking\nat her, his eyes lingering on a flower that she wore in her bosom.\nAlmost with the abstraction of a somnambulist he stretched out his hand\nand gently caressed the flower.\n\nShe drew back.  \"What are you doing, Giles Winterborne!\" she exclaimed,\nwith a look of severe surprise.  The evident absence of all\npremeditation from the act, however, speedily led her to think that it\nwas not necessary to stand upon her dignity here and now. \"You must\nbear in mind, Giles,\" she said, kindly, \"that we are not as we were;\nand some people might have said that what you did was taking a liberty.\"\n\nIt was more than she need have told him; his action of forgetfulness\nhad made him so angry with himself that he flushed through his tan.  \"I\ndon't know what I am coming to!\" he exclaimed, savagely.  \"Ah--I was\nnot once like this!\" Tears of vexation were in his eyes.\n\n\"No, now--it was nothing.  I was too reproachful.\"\n\n\"It would not have occurred to me if I had not seen something like it\ndone elsewhere--at Middleton lately,\" he said, thoughtfully, after a\nwhile.\n\n\"By whom?\"\n\n\"Don't ask it.\"\n\nShe scanned him narrowly.  \"I know quite well enough,\" she returned,\nindifferently.  \"It was by my husband, and the woman was Mrs. Charmond.\nAssociation of ideas reminded you when you saw me....Giles--tell me all\nyou know about that--please do, Giles! But no--I won't hear it.  Let\nthe subject cease.  And as you are my friend, say nothing to my father.\"\n\nThey reached a place where their ways divided.  Winterborne continued\nalong the highway which kept outside the copse, and Grace opened a gate\nthat entered it.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\nShe walked up the soft grassy ride, screened on either hand by\nnut-bushes, just now heavy with clusters of twos and threes and fours.\nA little way on, the track she pursued was crossed by a similar one at\nright angles.  Here Grace stopped; some few yards up the transverse\nride the buxom Suke Damson was visible--her gown tucked up high through\nher pocket-hole, and no bonnet on her head--in the act of pulling down\nboughs from which she was gathering and eating nuts with great\nrapidity, her lover Tim Tangs standing near her engaged in the same\npleasant meal.\n\nCrack, crack went Suke's jaws every second or two.  By an automatic\nchain of thought Grace's mind reverted to the tooth-drawing scene\ndescribed by her husband; and for the first time she wondered if that\nnarrative were really true, Susan's jaws being so obviously sound and\nstrong.  Grace turned up towards the nut-gatherers, and conquered her\nreluctance to speak to the girl who was a little in advance of Tim.\n\"Good-evening, Susan,\" she said.\n\n\"Good-evening, Miss Melbury\" (crack).\n\n\"Mrs. Fitzpiers.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, ma'am--Mrs. Fitzpiers,\" said Suke, with a peculiar smile.\n\nGrace, not to be daunted, continued: \"Take care of your teeth, Suke.\nThat accounts for the toothache.\"\n\n\"I don't know what an ache is, either in tooth, ear, or head, thank the\nLord\" (crack).\n\n\"Nor the loss of one, either?\"\n\n\"See for yourself, ma'am.\" She parted her red lips, and exhibited the\nwhole double row, full up and unimpaired.\n\n\"You have never had one drawn?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"So much the better for your stomach,\" said Mrs. Fitzpiers, in an\naltered voice.  And turning away quickly, she went on.\n\nAs her husband's character thus shaped itself under the touch of time,\nGrace was almost startled to find how little she suffered from that\njealous excitement which is conventionally attributed to all wives in\nsuch circumstances.  But though possessed by none of that feline\nwildness which it was her moral duty to experience, she did not fail to\nknow that she had made a frightful mistake in her marriage.\nAcquiescence in her father's wishes had been degradation to herself.\nPeople are not given premonitions for nothing; she should have obeyed\nher impulse on that early morning, and steadfastly refused her hand.\n\nOh, that plausible tale which her then betrothed had told her about\nSuke--the dramatic account of her entreaties to him to draw the aching\nenemy, and the fine artistic touch he had given to the story by\nexplaining that it was a lovely molar without a flaw!\n\nShe traced the remainder of the woodland track dazed by the\ncomplications of her position.  If his protestations to her before\ntheir marriage could be believed, her husband had felt affection of\nsome sort for herself and this woman simultaneously; and was now again\nspreading the same emotion over Mrs. Charmond and herself conjointly,\nhis manner being still kind and fond at times. But surely, rather than\nthat, he must have played the hypocrite towards her in each case with\nelaborate completeness; and the thought of this sickened her, for it\ninvolved the conjecture that if he had not loved her, his only motive\nfor making her his wife must have been her little fortune.  Yet here\nGrace made a mistake, for the love of men like Fitzpiers is\nunquestionably of such quality as to bear division and transference.\nHe had indeed, once declared, though not to her, that on one occasion\nhe had noticed himself to be possessed by five distinct infatuations at\nthe same time.  Therein it differed from the highest affection as the\nlower orders of the animal world differ from advanced organisms,\npartition causing, not death, but a multiplied existence.  He had loved\nher sincerely, and had by no means ceased to love her now. But such\ndouble and treble barrelled hearts were naturally beyond her conception.\n\nOf poor Suke Damson, Grace thought no more.  She had had her day.\n\n\"If he does not love me I will not love him!\" said Grace, proudly. And\nthough these were mere words, it was a somewhat formidable thing for\nFitzpiers that her heart was approximating to a state in which it might\nbe possible to carry them out.  That very absence of hot jealousy which\nmade his courses so easy, and on which, indeed, he congratulated\nhimself, meant, unknown to either wife or husband, more mischief than\nthe inconvenient watchfulness of a jaundiced eye.\n\nHer sleep that night was nervous.  The wing allotted to her and her\nhusband had never seemed so lonely.  At last she got up, put on her\ndressing-gown, and went down-stairs.  Her father, who slept lightly,\nheard her descend, and came to the stair-head.\n\n\"Is that you, Grace? What's the matter?\" he said.\n\n\"Nothing more than that I am restless.  Edgar is detained by a case at\nOwlscombe in White Hart Vale.\"\n\n\"But how's that? I saw the woman's husband at Great Hintock just afore\nbedtime; and she was going on well, and the doctor gone then.\"\n\n\"Then he's detained somewhere else,\" said Grace.  \"Never mind me; he\nwill soon be home.  I expect him about one.\"\n\nShe went back to her room, and dozed and woke several times.  One\no'clock had been the hour of his return on the last occasion; but it\npassed now by a long way, and Fitzpiers did not come.  Just before dawn\nshe heard the men stirring in the yard; and the flashes of their\nlanterns spread every now and then through her window-blind.  She\nremembered that her father had told her not to be disturbed if she\nnoticed them, as they would be rising early to send off four loads of\nhurdles to a distant sheep-fair.  Peeping out, she saw them bustling\nabout, the hollow-turner among the rest; he was loading his\nwares--wooden-bowls, dishes, spigots, spoons, cheese-vats, funnels, and\nso on--upon one of her father's wagons, who carried them to the fair\nfor him every year out of neighborly kindness.\n\nThe scene and the occasion would have enlivened her but that her\nhusband was still absent; though it was now five o'clock.  She could\nhardly suppose him, whatever his infatuation, to have prolonged to a\nlater hour than ten an ostensibly professional call on Mrs. Charmond at\nMiddleton; and he could have ridden home in two hours and a half.\nWhat, then, had become of him? That he had been out the greater part of\nthe two preceding nights added to her uneasiness.\n\nShe dressed herself, descended, and went out, the weird twilight of\nadvancing day chilling the rays from the lanterns, and making the men's\nfaces wan.  As soon as Melbury saw her he came round, showing his alarm.\n\n\"Edgar is not come,\" she said.  \"And I have reason to know that he's\nnot attending anybody.  He has had no rest for two nights before this.\nI was going to the top of the hill to look for him.\"\n\n\"I'll come with you,\" said Melbury.\n\nShe begged him not to hinder himself; but he insisted, for he saw a\npeculiar and rigid gloom in her face over and above her uneasiness, and\ndid not like the look of it.  Telling the men he would be with them\nagain soon, he walked beside her into the turnpike-road, and partly up\nthe hill whence she had watched Fitzpiers the night before across the\nGreat White Hart or Blackmoor Valley.  They halted beneath a half-dead\noak, hollow, and disfigured with white tumors, its roots spreading out\nlike accipitrine claws grasping the ground.  A chilly wind circled\nround them, upon whose currents the seeds of a neighboring lime-tree,\nsupported parachute-wise by the wing attached, flew out of the boughs\ndownward like fledglings from their nest.  The vale was wrapped in a\ndim atmosphere of unnaturalness, and the east was like a livid curtain\nedged with pink.  There was no sign nor sound of Fitzpiers.\n\n\"It is no use standing here,\" said her father.  \"He may come home fifty\nways...why, look here!--here be Darling's tracks--turned homeward and\nnearly blown dry and hard! He must have come in hours ago without your\nseeing him.\"\n\n\"He has not done that,\" said she.\n\nThey went back hastily.  On entering their own gates they perceived\nthat the men had left the wagons, and were standing round the door of\nthe stable which had been appropriated to the doctor's use.  \"Is there\nanything the matter?\" cried Grace.\n\n\"Oh no, ma'am.  All's well that ends well,\" said old Timothy Tangs.\n\"I've heard of such things before--among workfolk, though not among\nyour gentle people--that's true.\"\n\nThey entered the stable, and saw the pale shape of Darling standing in\nthe middle of her stall, with Fitzpiers on her back, sound asleep.\nDarling was munching hay as well as she could with the bit in her\nmonth, and the reins, which had fallen from Fitzpiers's hand, hung upon\nher neck.\n\nGrace went and touched his hand; shook it before she could arouse him.\nHe moved, started, opened his eyes, and exclaimed, \"Ah, Felice!...Oh,\nit's Grace.  I could not see in the gloom.  What--am I in the saddle?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said she.  \"How do you come here?\"\n\nHe collected his thoughts, and in a few minutes stammered, \"I was\nriding along homeward through the vale, very, very sleepy, having been\nup so much of late.  When I came opposite Holywell spring the mare\nturned her head that way, as if she wanted to drink.  I let her go in,\nand she drank; I thought she would never finish.  While she was\ndrinking, the clock of Owlscombe Church struck twelve.  I distinctly\nremember counting the strokes.  From that moment I positively recollect\nnothing till I saw you here by my side.\"\n\n\"The name! If it had been any other horse he'd have had a broken neck!\"\nmurmured Melbury.\n\n\"'Tis wonderful, sure, how a quiet hoss will bring a man home at such\ntimes!\" said John Upjohn.  \"And what's more wonderful than keeping your\nseat in a deep, slumbering sleep?  I've knowed men drowze off walking\nhome from randies where the mead and other liquors have gone round\nwell, and keep walking for more than a mile on end without waking.\nWell, doctor, I don't care who the man is, 'tis a mercy you wasn't a\ndrownded, or a splintered, or a hanged up to a tree like Absalom--also\na handsome gentleman like yerself, as the prophets say.\"\n\n\"True,\" murmured old Timothy.  \"From the soul of his foot to the crown\nof his head there was no blemish in him.\"\n\n\"Or leastwise you might ha' been a-wownded into tatters a'most, and no\ndoctor to jine your few limbs together within seven mile!\"\n\nWhile this grim address was proceeding, Fitzpiers had dismounted, and\ntaking Grace's arm walked stiffly in-doors with her.  Melbury stood\nstaring at the horse, which, in addition to being very weary, was\nspattered with mud.  There was no mud to speak of about the Hintocks\njust now--only in the clammy hollows of the vale beyond Owlscombe, the\nstiff soil of which retained moisture for weeks after the uplands were\ndry.  While they were rubbing down the mare, Melbury's mind coupled\nwith the foreign quality of the mud the name he had heard unconsciously\nmuttered by the surgeon when Grace took his hand--\"Felice.\"  Who was\nFelice? Why, Mrs. Charmond; and she, as he knew, was staying at\nMiddleton.\n\nMelbury had indeed pounced upon the image that filled Fitzpiers's\nhalf-awakened soul--wherein there had been a picture of a recent\ninterview on a lawn with a capriciously passionate woman who had begged\nhim not to come again in tones whose vibration incited him to disobey.\n\"What are you doing here? Why do you pursue me? Another belongs to you.\nIf they were to see you they would seize you as a thief!\" And she had\nturbulently admitted to his wringing questions that her visit to\nMiddleton had been undertaken less because of the invalid relative than\nin shamefaced fear of her own weakness if she remained near his home.\nA triumph then it was to Fitzpiers, poor and hampered as he had become,\nto recognize his real conquest of this beauty, delayed so many years.\nHis was the selfish passion of Congreve's Millamont, to whom love's\nsupreme delight lay in \"that heart which others bleed for, bleed for\nme.\"\n\nWhen the horse had been attended to Melbury stood uneasily here and\nthere about his premises; he was rudely disturbed in the comfortable\nviews which had lately possessed him on his domestic concerns.  It is\ntrue that he had for some days discerned that Grace more and more\nsought his company, preferred supervising his kitchen and bakehouse\nwith her step-mother to occupying herself with the lighter details of\nher own apartments.  She seemed no longer able to find in her own\nhearth an adequate focus for her life, and hence, like a weak queen-bee\nafter leading off to an independent home, had hovered again into the\nparent hive.  But he had not construed these and other incidents of the\nkind till now.\n\nSomething was wrong in the dove-cot.  A ghastly sense that he alone\nwould be responsible for whatever unhappiness should be brought upon\nher for whom he almost solely lived, whom to retain under his roof he\nhad faced the numerous inconveniences involved in giving up the best\npart of his house to Fitzpiers.  There was no room for doubt that, had\nhe allowed events to take their natural course, she would have accepted\nWinterborne, and realized his old dream of restitution to that young\nman's family.\n\nThat Fitzpiers could allow himself to look on any other creature for a\nmoment than Grace filled Melbury with grief and astonishment.  In the\npure and simple life he had led it had scarcely occurred to him that\nafter marriage a man might be faithless.  That he could sweep to the\nheights of Mrs. Charmond's position, lift the veil of Isis, so to\nspeak, would have amazed Melbury by its audacity if he had not\nsuspected encouragement from that quarter.  What could he and his\nsimple Grace do to countervail the passions of such as those two\nsophisticated beings--versed in the world's ways, armed with every\napparatus for victory?  In such an encounter the homely timber-dealer\nfelt as inferior as a bow-and-arrow savage before the precise weapons\nof modern warfare.\n\nGrace came out of the house as the morning drew on.  The village was\nsilent, most of the folk having gone to the fair.  Fitzpiers had\nretired to bed, and was sleeping off his fatigue.  She went to the\nstable and looked at poor Darling: in all probability Giles\nWinterborne, by obtaining for her a horse of such intelligence and\ndocility, had been the means of saving her husband's life.  She paused\nover the strange thought; and then there appeared her father behind\nher.  She saw that he knew things were not as they ought to be, from\nthe troubled dulness of his eye, and from his face, different points of\nwhich had independent motions, twitchings, and tremblings, unknown to\nhimself, and involuntary.\n\n\"He was detained, I suppose, last night?\" said Melbury.\n\n\"Oh yes; a bad case in the vale,\" she replied, calmly.\n\n\"Nevertheless, he should have stayed at home.\"\n\n\"But he couldn't, father.\"\n\nHer father turned away.  He could hardly bear to see his whilom\ntruthful girl brought to the humiliation of having to talk like that.\n\nThat night carking care sat beside Melbury's pillow, and his stiff\nlimbs tossed at its presence.  \"I can't lie here any longer,\" he\nmuttered.  Striking a light, he wandered about the room.  \"What have I\ndone--what have I done for her?\" he said to his wife, who had anxiously\nawakened.  \"I had long planned that she should marry the son of the man\nI wanted to make amends to; do ye mind how I told you all about it,\nLucy, the night before she came home? Ah! but I was not content with\ndoing right, I wanted to do more!\"\n\n\"Don't raft yourself without good need, George,\" she replied.  \"I won't\nquite believe that things are so much amiss.  I won't believe that Mrs.\nCharmond has encouraged him.  Even supposing she has encouraged a great\nmany, she can have no motive to do it now. What so likely as that she\nis not yet quite well, and doesn't care to let another doctor come near\nher?\"\n\nHe did not heed.  \"Grace used to be so busy every day, with fixing a\ncurtain here and driving a tin-tack there; but she cares for no\nemployment now!\"\n\n\"Do you know anything of Mrs. Charmond's past history? Perhaps that\nwould throw some light upon things.  Before she came here as the wife\nof old Charmond four or five years ago, not a soul seems to have heard\naught of her.  Why not make inquiries? And then do ye wait and see\nmore; there'll be plenty of opportunity.  Time enough to cry when you\nknow 'tis a crying matter; and 'tis bad to meet troubles half-way.\"\n\nThere was some good-sense in the notion of seeing further. Melbury\nresolved to inquire and wait, hoping still, but oppressed\nbetween-whiles with much fear.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX.\n\nExamine Grace as her father might, she would admit nothing.  For the\npresent, therefore, he simply watched.\n\nThe suspicion that his darling child was being slighted wrought almost\na miraculous change in Melbury's nature.  No man so furtive for the\ntime as the ingenuous countryman who finds that his ingenuousness has\nbeen abused.  Melbury's heretofore confidential candor towards his\ngentlemanly son-in-law was displaced by a feline stealth that did\ninjury to his every action, thought, and mood.  He knew that a woman\nonce given to a man for life took, as a rule, her lot as it came and\nmade the best of it, without external interference; but for the first\ntime he asked himself why this so generally should be so.  Moreover,\nthis case was not, he argued, like ordinary cases.  Leaving out the\nquestion of Grace being anything but an ordinary woman, her peculiar\nsituation, as it were in mid-air between two planes of society,\ntogether with the loneliness of Hintock, made a husband's neglect a far\nmore tragical matter to her than it would be to one who had a large\ncircle of friends to fall back upon.  Wisely or unwisely, and whatever\nother fathers did, he resolved to fight his daughter's battle still.\n\nMrs. Charmond had returned.  But Hintock House scarcely gave forth\nsigns of life, so quietly had she reentered it.  He went to church at\nGreat Hintock one afternoon as usual, there being no service at the\nsmaller village.  A few minutes before his departure, he had casually\nheard Fitzpiers, who was no church-goer, tell his wife that he was\ngoing to walk in the wood.  Melbury entered the building and sat down\nin his pew; the parson came in, then Mrs. Charmond, then Mr. Fitzpiers.\n\nThe service proceeded, and the jealous father was quite sure that a\nmutual consciousness was uninterruptedly maintained between those two;\nhe fancied that more than once their eyes met.  At the end, Fitzpiers\nso timed his movement into the aisle that it exactly coincided with\nFelice Charmond's from the opposite side, and they walked out with\ntheir garments in contact, the surgeon being just that two or three\ninches in her rear which made it convenient for his eyes to rest upon\nher cheek.  The cheek warmed up to a richer tone.\n\nThis was a worse feature in the flirtation than he had expected. If she\nhad been playing with him in an idle freak the game might soon have\nwearied her; but the smallest germ of passion--and women of the world\ndo not change color for nothing--was a threatening development.  The\nmere presence of Fitzpiers in the building, after his statement, was\nwellnigh conclusive as far as he was concerned; but Melbury resolved\nyet to watch.\n\nHe had to wait long.  Autumn drew shiveringly to its end.  One day\nsomething seemed to be gone from the gardens; the tenderer leaves of\nvegetables had shrunk under the first smart frost, and hung like faded\nlinen rags; then the forest leaves, which had been descending at\nleisure, descended in haste and in multitudes, and all the golden\ncolors that had hung overhead were now crowded together in a degraded\nmass underfoot, where the fallen myriads got redder and hornier, and\ncurled themselves up to rot.  The only suspicious features in Mrs.\nCharmond's existence at this season were two: the first, that she lived\nwith no companion or relative about her, which, considering her age and\nattractions, was somewhat unusual conduct for a young widow in a lonely\ncountry-house; the other, that she did not, as in previous years,\nstart from Hintock to winter abroad.  In Fitzpiers, the only change\nfrom his last autumn's habits lay in his abandonment of night\nstudy--his lamp never shone from his new dwelling as from his old.\n\nIf the suspected ones met, it was by such adroit contrivances that even\nMelbury's vigilance could not encounter them together.  A simple call\nat her house by the doctor had nothing irregular about it, and that he\nhad paid two or three such calls was certain. What had passed at those\ninterviews was known only to the parties themselves; but that Felice\nCharmond was under some one's influence Melbury soon had opportunity of\nperceiving.\n\nWinter had come on.  Owls began to be noisy in the mornings and\nevenings, and flocks of wood-pigeons made themselves prominent again.\nOne day in February, about six months after the marriage of Fitzpiers,\nMelbury was returning from Great Hintock on foot through the lane, when\nhe saw before him the surgeon also walking. Melbury would have\novertaken him, but at that moment Fitzpiers turned in through a gate to\none of the rambling drives among the trees at this side of the wood,\nwhich led to nowhere in particular, and the beauty of whose serpentine\ncurves was the only justification of their existence.  Felice almost\nsimultaneously trotted down the lane towards the timber-dealer, in a\nlittle basket-carriage which she sometimes drove about the estate,\nunaccompanied by a servant.  She turned in at the same place without\nhaving seen either Melbury or apparently Fitzpiers. Melbury was soon at\nthe spot, despite his aches and his sixty years.  Mrs. Charmond had\ncome up with the doctor, who was standing immediately behind the\ncarriage.  She had turned to him, her arm being thrown carelessly over\nthe back of the seat.  They looked in each other's faces without\nuttering a word, an arch yet gloomy smile wreathing her lips.\nFitzpiers clasped her hanging hand, and, while she still remained in\nthe same listless attitude, looking volumes into his eyes, he\nstealthily unbuttoned her glove, and stripped her hand of it by rolling\nback the gauntlet over the fingers, so that it came off inside out.  He\nthen raised her hand to his month, she still reclining passively,\nwatching him as she might have watched a fly upon her dress.  At last\nshe said, \"Well, sir, what excuse for this disobedience?\"\n\n\"I make none.\"\n\n\"Then go your way, and let me go mine.\" She snatched away her hand,\ntouched the pony with the whip, and left him standing there, holding\nthe reversed glove.\n\nMelbury's first impulse was to reveal his presence to Fitzpiers, and\nupbraid him bitterly.  But a moment's thought was sufficient to show\nhim the futility of any such simple proceeding.  There was not, after\nall, so much in what he had witnessed as in what that scene might be\nthe surface and froth of--probably a state of mind on which censure\noperates as an aggravation rather than as a cure. Moreover, he said to\nhimself that the point of attack should be the woman, if either.  He\ntherefore kept out of sight, and musing sadly, even tearfully--for he\nwas meek as a child in matters concerning his daughter--continued his\nway towards Hintock.\n\nThe insight which is bred of deep sympathy was never more finely\nexemplified than in this instance.  Through her guarded manner, her\ndignified speech, her placid countenance, he discerned the interior of\nGrace's life only too truly, hidden as were its incidents from every\nouter eye.\n\nThese incidents had become painful enough.  Fitzpiers had latterly\ndeveloped an irritable discontent which vented itself in monologues\nwhen Grace was present to hear them.  The early morning of this day had\nbeen dull, after a night of wind, and on looking out of the window\nFitzpiers had observed some of Melbury's men dragging away a large limb\nwhich had been snapped off a beech-tree.  Everything was cold and\ncolorless.\n\n\"My good Heaven!\" he said, as he stood in his dressing-gown. \"This is\nlife!\" He did not know whether Grace was awake or not, and he would not\nturn his head to ascertain.  \"Ah, fool,\" he went on to himself, \"to\nclip your own wings when you were free to soar!...But I could not rest\ntill I had done it.  Why do I never recognize an opportunity till I\nhave missed it, nor the good or ill of a step till it is\nirrevocable!...I fell in love....Love, indeed!--\n\n    \"'Love's but the frailty of the mind\n      When 'tis not with ambition joined;\n      A sickly flame which if not fed, expires,\n      And feeding, wastes in self-consuming fires!'\n\nAh, old author of 'The Way of the World,' you knew--you knew!\" Grace\nmoved.  He thought she had heard some part of his soliloquy. He was\nsorry--though he had not taken any precaution to prevent her.\n\nHe expected a scene at breakfast, but she only exhibited an extreme\nreserve.  It was enough, however, to make him repent that he should\nhave done anything to produce discomfort; for he attributed her manner\nentirely to what he had said.  But Grace's manner had not its cause\neither in his sayings or in his doings. She had not heard a single word\nof his regrets.  Something even nearer home than her husband's blighted\nprospects--if blighted they were--was the origin of her mood, a mood\nthat was the mere continuation of what her father had noticed when he\nwould have preferred a passionate jealousy in her, as the more natural.\n\nShe had made a discovery--one which to a girl of honest nature was\nalmost appalling.  She had looked into her heart, and found that her\nearly interest in Giles Winterborne had become revitalized into\nluxuriant growth by her widening perceptions of what was great and\nlittle in life.  His homeliness no longer offended her acquired tastes;\nhis comparative want of so-called culture did not now jar on her\nintellect; his country dress even pleased her eye; his exterior\nroughness fascinated her.  Having discovered by marriage how much that\nwas humanly not great could co-exist with attainments of an exceptional\norder, there was a revulsion in her sentiments from all that she had\nformerly clung to in this kind: honesty, goodness, manliness,\ntenderness, devotion, for her only existed in their purity now in the\nbreasts of unvarnished men; and here was one who had manifested them\ntowards her from his youth up.\n\nThere was, further, that never-ceasing pity in her soul for Giles as a\nman whom she had wronged--a man who had been unfortunate in his worldly\ntransactions; while, not without a touch of sublimity, he had, like\nHoratio, borne himself throughout his scathing\n\n    \"As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing.\"\n\n\nIt was these perceptions, and no subtle catching of her husband's\nmurmurs, that had bred the abstraction visible in her.\n\nWhen her father approached the house after witnessing the interview\nbetween Fitzpiers and Mrs. Charmond, Grace was looking out of her\nsitting-room window, as if she had nothing to do, or think of, or care\nfor.  He stood still.\n\n\"Ah, Grace,\" he said, regarding her fixedly.\n\n\"Yes, father,\" she murmured.\n\n\"Waiting for your dear husband?\" he inquired, speaking with the sarcasm\nof pitiful affection.\n\n\"Oh no--not especially.  He has a great many patients to see this\nafternoon.\"\n\nMelbury came quite close.  \"Grace, what's the use of talking like that,\nwhen you know--Here, come down and walk with me out in the garden,\nchild.\"\n\nHe unfastened the door in the ivy-laced wall, and waited.  This\napparent indifference alarmed him.  He would far rather that she had\nrushed in all the fire of jealousy to Hintock House, regardless of\nconventionality, confronted and attacked Felice Charmond _unguibus et\nrostro_, and accused her even in exaggerated shape of stealing away her\nhusband.  Such a storm might have cleared the air.\n\nShe emerged in a minute or two, and they went inside together. \"You\nknow as well as I do,\" he resumed, \"that there is something threatening\nmischief to your life; and yet you pretend you do not. Do you suppose I\ndon't see the trouble in your face every day?  I am very sure that this\nquietude is wrong conduct in you.  You should look more into matters.\"\n\n\"I am quiet because my sadness is not of a nature to stir me to action.\"\n\nMelbury wanted to ask her a dozen questions--did she not feel jealous?\nwas she not indignant? but a natural delicacy restrained him.  \"You are\nvery tame and let-alone, I am bound to say,\" he remarked, pointedly.\n\n\"I am what I feel, father,\" she repeated.\n\nHe glanced at her, and there returned upon his mind the scene of her\noffering to wed Winterborne instead of Fitzpiers in the last days\nbefore her marriage; and he asked himself if it could be the fact that\nshe loved Winterborne, now that she had lost him, more than she had\never done when she was comparatively free to choose him.\n\n\"What would you have me do?\" she asked, in a low voice.\n\nHe recalled his mind from the retrospective pain to the practical\nmatter before them.  \"I would have you go to Mrs. Charmond,\" he said.\n\n\"Go to Mrs. Charmond--what for?\" said she.\n\n\"Well--if I must speak plain, dear Grace--to ask her, appeal to her in\nthe name of your common womanhood, and your many like sentiments on\nthings, not to make unhappiness between you and your husband.  It lies\nwith her entirely to do one or the other--that I can see.\"\n\nGrace's face had heated at her father's words, and the very rustle of\nher skirts upon the box-edging bespoke hauteur.  \"I shall not think of\ngoing to her, father--of course I could not!\" she answered.\n\n\"Why--don't 'ee want to be happier than you be at present?\" said\nMelbury, more moved on her account than she was herself.\n\n\"I don't wish to be more humiliated.  If I have anything to bear I can\nbear it in silence.\"\n\n\"But, my dear maid, you are too young--you don't know what the present\nstate of things may lead to.  Just see the harm done a'ready! Your\nhusband would have gone away to Budmouth to a bigger practice if it had\nnot been for this.  Although it has gone such a little way, it is\npoisoning your future even now.  Mrs. Charmond is thoughtlessly bad,\nnot bad by calculation; and just a word to her now might save 'ee a\npeck of woes.\"\n\n\"Ah, I loved her once,\" said Grace, with a broken articulation, \"and\nshe would not care for me then! Now I no longer love her. Let her do\nher worst: I don't care.\"\n\n\"You ought to care.  You have got into a very good position to start\nwith.  You have been well educated, well tended, and you have become\nthe wife of a professional man of unusually good family.  Surely you\nought to make the best of your position.\"\n\n\"I don't see that I ought.  I wish I had never got into it.  I wish you\nhad never, never thought of educating me.  I wish I worked in the woods\nlike Marty South.  I hate genteel life, and I want to be no better than\nshe.\"\n\n\"Why?\" said her amazed father.\n\n\"Because cultivation has only brought me inconveniences and troubles.\nI say again, I wish you had never sent me to those fashionable schools\nyou set your mind on.  It all arose out of that, father.  If I had\nstayed at home I should have married--\" She closed up her mouth\nsuddenly and was silent; and he saw that she was not far from crying.\n\nMelbury was much grieved.  \"What, and would you like to have grown up\nas we be here in Hintock--knowing no more, and with no more chance of\nseeing good life than we have here?\"\n\n\"Yes.  I have never got any happiness outside Hintock that I know of,\nand I have suffered many a heartache at being sent away.  Oh, the\nmisery of those January days when I had got back to school, and left\nyou all here in the wood so happy.  I used to wonder why I had to bear\nit.  And I was always a little despised by the other girls at school,\nbecause they knew where I came from, and that my parents were not in so\ngood a station as theirs.\"\n\nHer poor father was much hurt at what he thought her ingratitude and\nintractability.  He had admitted to himself bitterly enough that he\nshould have let young hearts have their way, or rather should have\nhelped on her affection for Winterborne, and given her to him according\nto his original plan; but he was not prepared for her deprecation of\nthose attainments whose completion had been a labor of years, and a\nsevere tax upon his purse.\n\n\"Very well,\" he said, with much heaviness of spirit.  \"If you don't\nlike to go to her I don't wish to force you.\"\n\nAnd so the question remained for him still: how should he remedy this\nperilous state of things?  For days he sat in a moody attitude over the\nfire, a pitcher of cider standing on the hearth beside him, and his\ndrinking-horn inverted upon the top of it.  He spent a week and more\nthus composing a letter to the chief offender, which he would every now\nand then attempt to complete, and suddenly crumple up in his hand.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI.\n\nAs February merged in March, and lighter evenings broke the gloom of\nthe woodmen's homeward journey, the Hintocks Great and Little began to\nhave ears for a rumor of the events out of which had grown the\ntimber-dealer's troubles.  It took the form of a wide sprinkling of\nconjecture, wherein no man knew the exact truth. Tantalizing phenomena,\nat once showing and concealing the real relationship of the persons\nconcerned, caused a diffusion of excited surprise.  Honest people as\nthe woodlanders were, it was hardly to be expected that they could\nremain immersed in the study of their trees and gardens amid such\ncircumstances, or sit with their backs turned like the good burghers of\nCoventry at the passage of the beautiful lady.\n\nRumor, for a wonder, exaggerated little.  There were, in fact, in this\ncase as in thousands, the well-worn incidents, old as the hills, which,\nwith individual variations, made a mourner of Ariadne, a by-word of\nVashti, and a corpse of the Countess Amy. There were rencounters\naccidental and contrived, stealthy correspondence, sudden misgivings on\none side, sudden self-reproaches on the other.  The inner state of the\ntwain was one as of confused noise that would not allow the accents of\ncalmer reason to be heard.  Determinations to go in this direction, and\nheadlong plunges in that; dignified safeguards, undignified collapses;\nnot a single rash step by deliberate intention, and all against\njudgment.\n\nIt was all that Melbury had expected and feared.  It was more, for he\nhad overlooked the publicity that would be likely to result, as it now\nhad done.  What should he do--appeal to Mrs. Charmond himself, since\nGrace would not? He bethought himself of Winterborne, and resolved to\nconsult him, feeling the strong need of some friend of his own sex to\nwhom he might unburden his mind.\n\nHe had entirely lost faith in his own judgment.  That judgment on which\nhe had relied for so many years seemed recently, like a false companion\nunmasked, to have disclosed unexpected depths of hypocrisy and\nspeciousness where all had seemed solidity.  He felt almost afraid to\nform a conjecture on the weather, or the time, or the fruit-promise, so\ngreat was his self-abasement.\n\nIt was a rimy evening when he set out to look for Giles.  The woods\nseemed to be in a cold sweat; beads of perspiration hung from every\nbare twig; the sky had no color, and the trees rose before him as\nhaggard, gray phantoms, whose days of substantiality were passed.\nMelbury seldom saw Winterborne now, but he believed him to be occupying\na lonely hut just beyond the boundary of Mrs. Charmond's estate, though\nstill within the circuit of the woodland.  The timber-merchant's thin\nlegs stalked on through the pale, damp scenery, his eyes on the dead\nleaves of last year; while every now and then a hasty \"Ay?\" escaped his\nlips in reply to some bitter proposition.\n\nHis notice was attracted by a thin blue haze of smoke, behind which\narose sounds of voices and chopping: bending his steps that way, he saw\nWinterborne just in front of him.  It just now happened that Giles,\nafter being for a long time apathetic and unemployed, had become one of\nthe busiest men in the neighborhood. It is often thus; fallen friends,\nlost sight of, we expect to find starving; we discover them going on\nfairly well.  Without any solicitation, or desire for profit on his\npart, he had been asked to execute during that winter a very large\norder for hurdles and other copse-ware, for which purpose he had been\nobliged to buy several acres of brushwood standing.  He was now engaged\nin the cutting and manufacture of the same, proceeding with the work\ndaily like an automaton.\n\nThe hazel-tree did not belie its name to-day.  The whole of the\ncopse-wood where the mist had cleared returned purest tints of that\nhue, amid which Winterborne himself was in the act of making a hurdle,\nthe stakes being driven firmly into the ground in a row, over which he\nbent and wove the twigs.  Beside him was a square, compact pile like\nthe altar of Cain, formed of hurdles already finished, which bristled\non all sides with the sharp points of their stakes.  At a little\ndistance the men in his employ were assisting him to carry out his\ncontract.  Rows of copse-wood lay on the ground as it had fallen under\nthe axe; and a shelter had been constructed near at hand, in front of\nwhich burned the fire whose smoke had attracted him.  The air was so\ndank that the smoke hung heavy, and crept away amid the bushes without\nrising from the ground.\n\nAfter wistfully regarding Winterborne a while, Melbury drew nearer, and\nbriefly inquired of Giles how he came to be so busily engaged, with an\nundertone of slight surprise that Winterborne could seem so thriving\nafter being deprived of Grace.  Melbury was not without emotion at the\nmeeting; for Grace's affairs had divided them, and ended their intimacy\nof old times.\n\nWinterborne explained just as briefly, without raising his eyes from\nhis occupation of chopping a bough that he held in front of him.\n\n\"'Twill be up in April before you get it all cleared,\" said Melbury.\n\n\"Yes, there or thereabouts,\" said Winterborne, a chop of the billhook\njerking the last word into two pieces.\n\nThere was another interval; Melbury still looked on, a chip from\nWinterborne's hook occasionally flying against the waistcoat and legs\nof his visitor, who took no heed.\n\n\"Ah, Giles--you should have been my partner.  You should have been my\nson-in-law,\" the old man said at last.  \"It would have been far better\nfor her and for me.\"\n\nWinterborne saw that something had gone wrong with his former friend,\nand throwing down the switch he was about to interweave, he responded\nonly too readily to the mood of the timber-dealer. \"Is she ill?\" he\nsaid, hurriedly.\n\n\"No, no.\" Melbury stood without speaking for some minutes, and then, as\nthough he could not bring himself to proceed, turned to go away.\n\nWinterborne told one of his men to pack up the tools for the night and\nwalked after Melbury.\n\n\"Heaven forbid that I should seem too inquisitive, sir,\" he said,\n\"especially since we don't stand as we used to stand to one another;\nbut I hope it is well with them all over your way?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Melbury--\"no.\"  He stopped, and struck the smooth trunk of a\nyoung ash-tree with the flat of his hand.  \"I would that his ear had\nbeen where that rind is!\" he exclaimed; \"I should have treated him to\nlittle compared wi what he deserves.\"\n\n\"Now,\" said Winterborne, \"don't be in a hurry to go home.  I've put\nsome cider down to warm in my shelter here, and we'll sit and drink it\nand talk this over.\"\n\nMelbury turned unresistingly as Giles took his arm, and they went back\nto where the fire was, and sat down under the screen, the other woodmen\nhaving gone.  He drew out the cider-mug from the ashes and they drank\ntogether.\n\n\"Giles, you ought to have had her, as I said just now,\" repeated\nMelbury.  \"I'll tell you why for the first time.\"\n\nHe thereupon told Winterborne, as with great relief, the story of how\nhe won away Giles's father's chosen one--by nothing worse than a\nlover's cajoleries, it is true, but by means which, except in love,\nwould certainly have been pronounced cruel and unfair.  He explained\nhow he had always intended to make reparation to Winterborne the father\nby giving Grace to Winterborne the son, till the devil tempted him in\nthe person of Fitzpiers, and he broke his virtuous vow.\n\n\"How highly I thought of that man, to be sure! Who'd have supposed he'd\nhave been so weak and wrong-headed as this! You ought to have had her,\nGiles, and there's an end on't.\"\n\nWinterborne knew how to preserve his calm under this unconsciously\ncruel tearing of a healing wound to which Melbury's concentration on\nthe more vital subject had blinded him.  The young man endeavored to\nmake the best of the case for Grace's sake.\n\n\"She would hardly have been happy with me,\" he said, in the dry,\nunimpassioned voice under which he hid his feelings.  \"I was not well\nenough educated: too rough, in short.  I couldn't have surrounded her\nwith the refinements she looked for, anyhow, at all.\"\n\n\"Nonsense--you are quite wrong there,\" said the unwise old man,\ndoggedly.  \"She told me only this day that she hates refinements and\nsuch like.  All that my trouble and money bought for her in that way is\nthrown away upon her quite.  She'd fain be like Marty South--think o'\nthat! That's the top of her ambition! Perhaps she's right.  Giles, she\nloved you--under the rind; and, what's more, she loves ye still--worse\nluck for the poor maid!\"\n\nIf Melbury only had known what fires he was recklessly stirring up he\nmight have held his peace.  Winterborne was silent a long time. The\ndarkness had closed in round them, and the monotonous drip of the fog\nfrom the branches quickened as it turned to fine rain.\n\n\"Oh, she never cared much for me,\" Giles managed to say, as he stirred\nthe embers with a brand.\n\n\"She did, and does, I tell ye,\" said the other, obstinately. \"However,\nall that's vain talking now.  What I come to ask you about is a more\npractical matter--how to make the best of things as they are.  I am\nthinking of a desperate step--of calling on the woman Charmond.  I am\ngoing to appeal to her, since Grace will not.  'Tis she who holds the\nbalance in her hands--not he.  While she's got the will to lead him\nastray he will follow--poor, unpractical, lofty-notioned dreamer--and\nhow long she'll do it depends upon her whim.  Did ye ever hear anything\nabout her character before she came to Hintock?\"\n\n\"She's been a bit of a charmer in her time, I believe,\" replied Giles,\nwith the same level quietude, as he regarded the red coals. \"One who\nhas smiled where she has not loved and loved where she has not married.\nBefore Mr. Charmond made her his wife she was a play-actress.\"\n\n\"Hey?  But how close you have kept all this, Giles! What besides?\"\n\n\"Mr. Charmond was a rich man, engaged in the iron trade in the north,\ntwenty or thirty years older than she.  He married her and retired, and\ncame down here and bought this property, as they do nowadays.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes--I know all about that; but the other I did not know.  I fear\nit bodes no good.  For how can I go and appeal to the forbearance of a\nwoman in this matter who has made cross-loves and crooked entanglements\nher trade for years?  I thank ye, Giles, for finding it out; but it\nmakes my plan the harder that she should have belonged to that unstable\ntribe.\"\n\nAnother pause ensued, and they looked gloomily at the smoke that beat\nabout the hurdles which sheltered them, through whose weavings a large\ndrop of rain fell at intervals and spat smartly into the fire.  Mrs.\nCharmond had been no friend to Winterborne, but he was manly, and it\nwas not in his heart to let her be condemned without a trial.\n\n\"She is said to be generous,\" he answered.  \"You might not appeal to\nher in vain.\"\n\n\"It shall be done,\" said Melbury, rising.  \"For good or for evil, to\nMrs. Charmond I'll go.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII.\n\nAt nine o'clock the next morning Melbury dressed himself up in shining\nbroadcloth, creased with folding and smelling of camphor, and started\nfor Hintock House.  He was the more impelled to go at once by the\nabsence of his son-in-law in London for a few days, to attend, really\nor ostensibly, some professional meetings.  He said nothing of his\ndestination either to his wife or to Grace, fearing that they might\nentreat him to abandon so risky a project, and went out unobserved.  He\nhad chosen his time with a view, as he supposed, of conveniently\ncatching Mrs. Charmond when she had just finished her breakfast, before\nany other business people should be about, if any came.  Plodding\nthoughtfully onward, he crossed a glade lying between Little Hintock\nWoods and the plantation which abutted on the park; and the spot being\nopen, he was discerned there by Winterborne from the copse on the next\nhill, where he and his men were working.  Knowing his mission, the\nyounger man hastened down from the copse and managed to intercept the\ntimber-merchant.\n\n\"I have been thinking of this, sir,\" he said, \"and I am of opinion that\nit would be best to put off your visit for the present.\"\n\nBut Melbury would not even stop to hear him.  His mind was made up, the\nappeal was to be made; and Winterborne stood and watched him sadly till\nhe entered the second plantation and disappeared.\n\nMelbury rang at the tradesmen's door of the manor-house, and was at\nonce informed that the lady was not yet visible, as indeed he might\nhave guessed had he been anybody but the man he was. Melbury said he\nwould wait, whereupon the young man informed him in a neighborly way\nthat, between themselves, she was in bed and asleep.\n\n\"Never mind,\" said Melbury, retreating into the court, \"I'll stand\nabout here.\" Charged so fully with his mission, he shrank from contact\nwith anybody.\n\nBut he walked about the paved court till he was tired, and still nobody\ncame to him.  At last he entered the house and sat down in a small\nwaiting-room, from which he got glimpses of the kitchen corridor, and\nof the white-capped maids flitting jauntily hither and thither.  They\nhad heard of his arrival, but had not seen him enter, and, imagining\nhim still in the court, discussed freely the possible reason of his\ncalling.  They marvelled at his temerity; for though most of the\ntongues which had been let loose attributed the chief blame-worthiness\nto Fitzpiers, these of her household preferred to regard their mistress\nas the deeper sinner.\n\nMelbury sat with his hands resting on the familiar knobbed thorn\nwalking-stick, whose growing he had seen before he enjoyed its use.\nThe scene to him was not the material environment of his person, but a\ntragic vision that travelled with him like an envelope.  Through this\nvision the incidents of the moment but gleamed confusedly here and\nthere, as an outer landscape through the high-colored scenes of a\nstained window.  He waited thus an hour, an hour and a half, two hours.\nHe began to look pale and ill, whereupon the butler, who came in, asked\nhim to have a glass of wine.  Melbury roused himself and said, \"No, no.\nIs she almost ready?\"\n\n\"She is just finishing breakfast,\" said the butler.  \"She will soon see\nyou now.  I am just going up to tell her you are here.\"\n\n\"What! haven't you told her before?\" said Melbury.\n\n\"Oh no,\" said the other.  \"You see you came so very early.\"\n\nAt last the bell rang: Mrs. Charmond could see him.  She was not in her\nprivate sitting-room when he reached it, but in a minute he heard her\ncoming from the front staircase, and she entered where he stood.\n\nAt this time of the morning Mrs. Charmond looked her full age and more.\nShe might almost have been taken for the typical femme de trente ans,\nthough she was really not more than seven or eight and twenty.  There\nbeing no fire in the room, she came in with a shawl thrown loosely\nround her shoulders, and obviously without the least suspicion that\nMelbury had called upon any other errand than timber.  Felice was,\nindeed, the only woman in the parish who had not heard the rumor of her\nown weaknesses; she was at this moment living in a fool's paradise in\nrespect of that rumor, though not in respect of the weaknesses\nthemselves, which, if the truth be told, caused her grave misgivings.\n\n\"Do sit down, Mr. Melbury.  You have felled all the trees that were to\nbe purchased by you this season, except the oaks, I believe.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Melbury.\n\n\"How very nice! It must be so charming to work in the woods just now!\"\n\nShe was too careless to affect an interest in an extraneous person's\naffairs so consummately as to deceive in the manner of the perfect\nsocial machine.  Hence her words \"very nice,\" \"so charming,\" were\nuttered with a perfunctoriness that made them sound absurdly unreal.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Melbury, in a reverie.  He did not take a chair, and\nshe also remained standing.  Resting upon his stick, he began: \"Mrs.\nCharmond, I have called upon a more serious matter--at least to\nme--than tree-throwing.  And whatever mistakes I make in my manner of\nspeaking upon it to you, madam, do me the justice to set 'em down to my\nwant of practice, and not to my want of care.\"\n\nMrs. Charmond looked ill at ease.  She might have begun to guess his\nmeaning; but apart from that, she had such dread of contact with\nanything painful, harsh, or even earnest, that his preliminaries alone\nwere enough to distress her.  \"Yes, what is it?\" she said.\n\n\"I am an old man,\" said Melbury, \"whom, somewhat late in life, God\nthought fit to bless with one child, and she a daughter.  Her mother\nwas a very dear wife to me, but she was taken away from us when the\nchild was young, and the child became precious as the apple of my eye\nto me, for she was all I had left to love.  For her sake entirely I\nmarried as second wife a homespun woman who had been kind as a mother\nto her.  In due time the question of her education came on, and I said,\n'I will educate the maid well, if I live upon bread to do it.' Of her\npossible marriage I could not bear to think, for it seemed like a death\nthat she should cleave to another man, and grow to think his house her\nhome rather than mine.  But I saw it was the law of nature that this\nshould be, and that it was for the maid's happiness that she should\nhave a home when I was gone; and I made up my mind without a murmur to\nhelp it on for her sake.  In my youth I had wronged my dead friend, and\nto make amends I determined to give her, my most precious possession,\nto my friend's son, seeing that they liked each other well. Things came\nabout which made me doubt if it would be for my daughter's happiness to\ndo this, inasmuch as the young man was poor, and she was delicately\nreared.  Another man came and paid court to her--one her equal in\nbreeding and accomplishments; in every way it seemed to me that he only\ncould give her the home which her training had made a necessity almost.\nI urged her on, and she married him.  But, ma'am, a fatal mistake was\nat the root of my reckoning.  I found that this well-born gentleman I\nhad calculated on so surely was not stanch of heart, and that therein\nlay a danger of great sorrow for my daughter.  Madam, he saw you, and\nyou know the rest....I have come to make no demands--to utter no\nthreats; I have come simply as a father in great grief about this only\nchild, and I beseech you to deal kindly with my daughter, and to do\nnothing which can turn her husband's heart away from her forever.\nForbid him your presence, ma'am, and speak to him on his duty as one\nwith your power over him well can do, and I am hopeful that the rent\nbetween them may be patched up. For it is not as if you would lose by\nso doing; your course is far higher than the courses of a simple\nprofessional man, and the gratitude you would win from me and mine by\nyour kindness is more than I can say.\"\n\nMrs. Charmond had first rushed into a mood of indignation on\ncomprehending Melbury's story; hot and cold by turns, she had murmured,\n\"Leave me, leave me!\" But as he seemed to take no notice of this, his\nwords began to influence her, and when he ceased speaking she said,\nwith hurried, hot breath, \"What has led you to think this of me?  Who\nsays I have won your daughter's husband away from her?  Some monstrous\ncalumnies are afloat--of which I have known nothing until now!\"\n\nMelbury started, and looked at her simply.  \"But surely, ma'am, you\nknow the truth better than I?\"\n\nHer features became a little pinched, and the touches of powder on her\nhandsome face for the first time showed themselves as an extrinsic\nfilm.  \"Will you leave me to myself?\" she said, with a faintness which\nsuggested a guilty conscience.  \"This is so utterly unexpected--you\nobtain admission to my presence by misrepresentation--\"\n\n\"As God's in heaven, ma'am, that's not true.  I made no pretence; and I\nthought in reason you would know why I had come.  This gossip--\"\n\n\"I have heard nothing of it.  Tell me of it, I say.\"\n\n\"Tell you, ma'am--not I.  What the gossip is, no matter.  What really\nis, you know.  Set facts right, and the scandal will right of itself.\nBut pardon me--I speak roughly; and I came to speak gently, to coax\nyou, beg you to be my daughter's friend.  She loved you once, ma'am;\nyou began by liking her.  Then you dropped her without a reason, and it\nhurt her warm heart more than I can tell ye.  But you were within your\nright as the superior, no doubt.  But if you would consider her\nposition now--surely, surely, you would do her no harm!\"\n\n\"Certainly I would do her no harm--I--\" Melbury's eye met hers. It was\ncurious, but the allusion to Grace's former love for her seemed to\ntouch her more than all Melbury's other arguments.  \"Oh, Melbury,\" she\nburst out, \"you have made me so unhappy! How could you come to me like\nthis! It is too dreadful! Now go away--go, go!\"\n\n\"I will,\" he said, in a husky tone.\n\nAs soon as he was out of the room she went to a corner and there sat\nand writhed under an emotion in which hurt pride and vexation mingled\nwith better sentiments.\n\nMrs. Charmond's mobile spirit was subject to these fierce periods of\nstress and storm.  She had never so clearly perceived till now that her\nsoul was being slowly invaded by a delirium which had brought about all\nthis; that she was losing judgment and dignity under it, becoming an\nanimated impulse only, a passion incarnate. A fascination had led her\non; it was as if she had been seized by a hand of velvet; and this was\nwhere she found herself--overshadowed with sudden night, as if a\ntornado had passed by.\n\nWhile she sat, or rather crouched, unhinged by the interview,\nlunch-time came, and then the early afternoon, almost without her\nconsciousness.  Then \"a strange gentleman who says it is not necessary\nto give his name,\" was suddenly announced.\n\n\"I cannot see him, whoever he may be.  I am not at home to anybody.\"\n\nShe heard no more of her visitor; and shortly after, in an attempt to\nrecover some mental serenity by violent physical exercise, she put on\nher hat and cloak and went out-of-doors, taking a path which led her up\nthe slopes to the nearest spur of the wood.  She disliked the woods,\nbut they had the advantage of being a place in which she could walk\ncomparatively unobserved.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\n\nThere was agitation to-day in the lives of all whom these matters\nconcerned.  It was not till the Hintock dinner-time--one o'clock--that\nGrace discovered her father's absence from the house after a departure\nin the morning under somewhat unusual conditions.  By a little\nreasoning and inquiry she was able to come to a conclusion on his\ndestination, and to divine his errand.\n\nHer husband was absent, and her father did not return.  He had, in\ntruth, gone on to Sherton after the interview, but this Grace did not\nknow.  In an indefinite dread that something serious would arise out of\nMelbury's visit by reason of the inequalities of temper and nervous\nirritation to which he was subject, something possibly that would bring\nher much more misery than accompanied her present negative state of\nmind, she left the house about three o'clock, and took a loitering walk\nin the woodland track by which she imagined he would come home.  This\ntrack under the bare trees and over the cracking sticks, screened and\nroofed in from the outer world of wind and cloud by a net-work of\nboughs, led her slowly on till in time she had left the larger trees\nbehind her and swept round into the coppice where Winterborne and his\nmen were clearing the undergrowth.\n\nHad Giles's attention been concentrated on his hurdles he would not\nhave seen her; but ever since Melbury's passage across the opposite\nglade in the morning he had been as uneasy and unsettled as Grace\nherself; and her advent now was the one appearance which, since her\nfather's avowal, could arrest him more than Melbury's return with his\ntidings.  Fearing that something might be the matter, he hastened up to\nher.\n\nShe had not seen her old lover for a long time, and, too conscious of\nthe late pranks of her heart, she could not behold him calmly. \"I am\nonly looking for my father,\" she said, in an unnecessarily apologetic\nintonation.\n\n\"I was looking for him too,\" said Giles.  \"I think he may perhaps have\ngone on farther.\"\n\n\"Then you knew he was going to the House, Giles?\" she said, turning her\nlarge tender eyes anxiously upon him.  \"Did he tell you what for?\"\n\nWinterborne glanced doubtingly at her, and then softly hinted that her\nfather had visited him the evening before, and that their old\nfriendship was quite restored, on which she guessed the rest.\n\n\"Oh, I am glad, indeed, that you two are friends again!\" she cried.\nAnd then they stood facing each other, fearing each other, troubling\neach other's souls.  Grace experienced acute misery at the sight of\nthese wood-cutting scenes, because she had estranged herself from them,\ncraving, even to its defects and inconveniences, that homely sylvan\nlife of her father which in the best probable succession of events\nwould shortly be denied her.\n\nAt a little distance, on the edge of the clearing, Marty South was\nshaping spar-gads to take home for manufacture during the evenings.\nWhile Winterborne and Mrs. Fitzpiers stood looking at her in their\nmutual embarrassment at each other's presence, they beheld approaching\nthe girl a lady in a dark fur mantle and a black hat, having a white\nveil tied picturesquely round it.  She spoke to Marty, who turned and\ncourtesied, and the lady fell into conversation with her.  It was Mrs.\nCharmond.\n\nOn leaving her house, Mrs. Charmond had walked on and onward under the\nfret and fever of her mind with more vigor than she was accustomed to\nshow in her normal moods--a fever which the solace of a cigarette did\nnot entirely allay.  Reaching the coppice, she listlessly observed\nMarty at work, threw away her cigarette, and came near.  Chop, chop,\nchop, went Marty's little billhook with never more assiduity, till Mrs.\nCharmond spoke.\n\n\"Who is that young lady I see talking to the woodman yonder?\" she asked.\n\n\"Mrs. Fitzpiers, ma'am,\" said Marty.\n\n\"Oh,\" said Mrs. Charmond, with something like a start; for she had not\nrecognized Grace at that distance.  \"And the man she is talking to?\"\n\n\"That's Mr. Winterborne.\"\n\nA redness stole into Marty's face as she mentioned Giles's name, which\nMrs. Charmond did not fail to notice informed her of the state of the\ngirl's heart.  \"Are you engaged to him?\" she asked, softly.\n\n\"No, ma'am,\" said Marty.  \"SHE was once; and I think--\"\n\nBut Marty could not possibly explain the complications of her thoughts\non this matter--which were nothing less than one of extraordinary\nacuteness for a girl so young and inexperienced--namely, that she saw\ndanger to two hearts naturally honest in Grace being thrown back into\nWinterborne's society by the neglect of her husband.  Mrs. Charmond,\nhowever, with the almost supersensory means to knowledge which women\nhave on such occasions, quite understood what Marty had intended to\nconvey, and the picture thus exhibited to her of lives drifting away,\ninvolving the wreck of poor Marty's hopes, prompted her to more\ngenerous resolves than all Melbury's remonstrances had been able to\nstimulate.\n\nFull of the new feeling, she bade the girl good-afternoon, and went on\nover the stumps of hazel to where Grace and Winterborne were standing.\nThey saw her approach, and Winterborne said, \"She is coming to you; it\nis a good omen.  She dislikes me, so I'll go away.\"  He accordingly\nretreated to where he had been working before Grace came, and Grace's\nformidable rival approached her, each woman taking the other's measure\nas she came near.\n\n\"Dear--Mrs. Fitzpiers,\" said Felice Charmond, with some inward turmoil\nwhich stopped her speech.  \"I have not seen you for a long time.\"\n\nShe held out her hand tentatively, while Grace stood like a wild animal\non first confronting a mirror or other puzzling product of\ncivilization.  Was it really Mrs. Charmond speaking to her thus? If it\nwas, she could no longer form any guess as to what it signified.\n\n\"I want to talk with you,\" said Mrs. Charmond, imploringly, for the\ngaze of the young woman had chilled her through.  \"Can you walk on with\nme till we are quite alone?\"\n\nSick with distaste, Grace nevertheless complied, as by clockwork and\nthey moved evenly side by side into the deeper recesses of the woods.\nThey went farther, much farther than Mrs. Charmond had meant to go; but\nshe could not begin her conversation, and in default of it kept walking.\n\n\"I have seen your father,\" she at length resumed.  \"And--I am much\ntroubled by what he told me.\"\n\n\"What did he tell you? I have not been admitted to his confidence on\nanything he may have said to you.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, why should I repeat to you what you can easily divine?\"\n\n\"True--true,\" returned Grace, mournfully.  \"Why should you repeat what\nwe both know to be in our minds already?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Fitzpiers, your husband--\" The moment that the speaker's tongue\ntouched the dangerous subject a vivid look of self-consciousness\nflashed over her, in which her heart revealed, as by a lightning gleam,\nwhat filled it to overflowing.  So transitory was the expression that\nnone but a sensitive woman, and she in Grace's position, would have had\nthe power to catch its meaning. Upon her the phase was not lost.\n\n\"Then you DO love him!\" she exclaimed, in a tone of much surprise.\n\n\"What do you mean, my young friend?\"\n\n\"Why,\" cried Grace, \"I thought till now that you had only been cruelly\nflirting with my husband, to amuse your idle moments--a rich lady with\na poor professional gentleman whom in her heart she despised not much\nless than her who belongs to him.  But I guess from your manner that\nyou love him desperately, and I don't hate you as I did before.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" continued Mrs. Fitzpiers, with a trembling tongue,\n\"since it is not playing in your case at all, but REAL.  Oh, I do pity\nyou, more than I despise you, for you will s-s-suffer most!\"\n\nMrs. Charmond was now as much agitated as Grace.  \"I ought not to allow\nmyself to argue with you,\" she exclaimed.  \"I demean myself by doing\nit.  But I liked you once, and for the sake of that time I try to tell\nyou how mistaken you are!\" Much of her confusion resulted from her\nwonder and alarm at finding herself in a sense dominated mentally and\nemotionally by this simple school-girl.  \"I do not love him,\" she went\non, with desperate untruth.  \"It was a kindness--my making somewhat\nmore of him than one usually does of one's doctor.  I was lonely; I\ntalked--well, I trifled with him. I am very sorry if such child's\nplaying out of pure friendship has been a serious matter to you.  Who\ncould have expected it? But the world is so simple here.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's affectation,\" said Grace, shaking her head.  \"It is no\nuse--you love him.  I can see in your face that in this matter of my\nhusband you have not let your acts belie your feelings.  During these\nlast four or six months you have been terribly indiscreet; but you have\nnot been insincere, and that almost disarms me.\"\n\n\"I HAVE been insincere--if you will have the word--I mean I HAVE\ncoquetted, and do NOT love him!\"\n\nBut Grace clung to her position like a limpet.  \"You may have trifled\nwith others, but him you love as you never loved another man.\"\n\n\"Oh, well--I won't argue,\" said Mrs. Charmond, laughing faintly. \"And\nyou come to reproach me for it, child.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Grace, magnanimously.  \"You may go on loving him if you\nlike--I don't mind at all.  You'll find it, let me tell you, a bitterer\nbusiness for yourself than for me in the end.  He'll get tired of you\nsoon, as tired as can be--you don't know him so well as I--and then you\nmay wish you had never seen him!\"\n\nMrs. Charmond had grown quite pale and weak under this prophecy. It was\nextraordinary that Grace, whom almost every one would have\ncharacterized as a gentle girl, should be of stronger fibre than her\ninterlocutor.  \"You exaggerate--cruel, silly young woman,\" she\nreiterated, writhing with little agonies.  \"It is nothing but playful\nfriendship--nothing! It will be proved by my future conduct.  I shall\nat once refuse to see him more--since it will make no difference to my\nheart, and much to my name.\"\n\n\"I question if you will refuse to see him again,\" said Grace, dryly, as\nwith eyes askance she bent a sapling down.  \"But I am not incensed\nagainst you as you are against me,\" she added, abandoning the tree to\nits natural perpendicular.  \"Before I came I had been despising you for\nwanton cruelty; now I only pity you for misplaced affection.  When\nEdgar has gone out of the house in hope of seeing you, at seasonable\nhours and unseasonable; when I have found him riding miles and miles\nacross the country at midnight, and risking his life, and getting\ncovered with mud, to get a glimpse of you, I have called him a foolish\nman--the plaything of a finished coquette.  I thought that what was\ngetting to be a tragedy to me was a comedy to you.  But now I see that\ntragedy lies on YOUR side of the situation no less than on MINE, and\nmore; that if I have felt trouble at my position, you have felt anguish\nat yours; that if I have had disappointments, you have had despairs.\nHeaven may fortify me--God help you!\"\n\n\"I cannot attempt to reply to your raving eloquence,\" returned the\nother, struggling to restore a dignity which had completely collapsed.\n\"My acts will be my proofs.  In the world which you have seen nothing\nof, friendships between men and women are not unknown, and it would\nhave been better both for you and your father if you had each judged me\nmore respectfully, and left me alone.  As it is I wish never to see or\nspeak to you, madam, any more.\"\n\nGrace bowed, and Mrs. Charmond turned away.  The two went apart in\ndirectly opposite courses, and were soon hidden from each other by\ntheir umbrageous surroundings and by the shadows of eve.\n\nIn the excitement of their long argument they had walked onward and\nzigzagged about without regarding direction or distance.  All sound of\nthe woodcutters had long since faded into remoteness, and even had not\nthe interval been too great for hearing them they would have been\nsilent and homeward bound at this twilight hour. But Grace went on her\ncourse without any misgiving, though there was much underwood here,\nwith only the narrowest passages for walking, across which brambles\nhung.  She had not, however, traversed this the wildest part of the\nwood since her childhood, and the transformation of outlines had been\ngreat; old trees which once were landmarks had been felled or blown\ndown, and the bushes which then had been small and scrubby were now\nlarge and overhanging.  She soon found that her ideas as to direction\nwere vague--that she had indeed no ideas as to direction at all.  If\nthe evening had not been growing so dark, and the wind had not put on\nits night moan so distinctly, Grace would not have minded; but she was\nrather frightened now, and began to strike across hither and thither in\nrandom courses.\n\nDenser grew the darkness, more developed the wind-voices, and still no\nrecognizable spot or outlet of any kind appeared, nor any sound of the\nHintocks floated near, though she had wandered probably between one and\ntwo hours, and began to be weary.  She was vexed at her foolishness,\nsince the ground she had covered, if in a straight line, must\ninevitably have taken her out of the wood to some remote village or\nother; but she had wasted her forces in countermarches; and now, in\nmuch alarm, wondered if she would have to pass the night here.  She\nstood still to meditate, and fancied that between the soughing of the\nwind she heard shuffling footsteps on the leaves heavier than those of\nrabbits or hares. Though fearing at first to meet anybody on the chance\nof his being a friend, she decided that the fellow night-rambler, even\nif a poacher, would not injure her, and that he might possibly be some\none sent to search for her.  She accordingly shouted a rather timid\n\"Hoi!\"\n\nThe cry was immediately returned by the other person; and Grace running\nat once in the direction whence it came beheld an indistinct figure\nhastening up to her as rapidly.  They were almost in each other's arms\nwhen she recognized in her vis-a-vis the outline and white veil of her\nwhom she had parted from an hour and a half before--Mrs. Charmond.\n\n\"I have lost my way, I have lost my way,\" cried that lady.  \"Oh--is it\nindeed you? I am so glad to meet you or anybody.  I have been wandering\nup and down ever since we parted, and am nearly dead with terror and\nmisery and fatigue!\"\n\n\"So am I,\" said Grace.  \"What shall we, shall we do?\"\n\n\"You won't go away from me?\" asked her companion, anxiously.\n\n\"No, indeed.  Are you very tired?\"\n\n\"I can scarcely move, and I am scratched dreadfully about the ankles.\"\n\nGrace reflected.  \"Perhaps, as it is dry under foot, the best thing for\nus to do would be to sit down for half an hour, and then start again\nwhen we have thoroughly rested.  By walking straight we must come to a\ntrack leading somewhere before the morning.\"\n\nThey found a clump of bushy hollies which afforded a shelter from the\nwind, and sat down under it, some tufts of dead fern, crisp and dry,\nthat remained from the previous season forming a sort of nest for them.\nBut it was cold, nevertheless, on this March night, particularly for\nGrace, who with the sanguine prematureness of youth in matters of\ndress, had considered it spring-time, and hence was not so warmly clad\nas Mrs. Charmond, who still wore her winter fur.  But after sitting a\nwhile the latter lady shivered no less than Grace as the warmth\nimparted by her hasty walking began to go off, and they felt the cold\nair drawing through the holly leaves which scratched their backs and\nshoulders.  Moreover, they could hear some drops of rain falling on the\ntrees, though none reached the nook in which they had ensconced\nthemselves.\n\n\"If we were to cling close together,\" said Mrs. Charmond, \"we should\nkeep each other warm.  But,\" she added, in an uneven voice, \"I suppose\nyou won't come near me for the world!\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because--well, you know.\"\n\n\"Yes.  I will--I don't hate you at all.\"\n\nThey consequently crept up to one another, and being in the dark,\nlonely and weary, did what neither had dreamed of doing beforehand,\nclasped each other closely, Mrs. Charmond's furs consoling Grace's cold\nface, and each one's body as she breathed alternately heaving against\nthat of her companion.\n\nWhen a few minutes had been spent thus, Mrs. Charmond said, \"I am so\nwretched!\" in a heavy, emotional whisper.\n\n\"You are frightened,\" said Grace, kindly.  \"But there is nothing to\nfear; I know these woods well.\"\n\n\"I am not at all frightened at the wood, but I am at other things.\"\n\nMrs. Charmond embraced Grace more and more tightly, and the younger\nwoman could feel her neighbor's breathings grow deeper and more\nspasmodic, as though uncontrollable feelings were germinating.\n\n\"After I had left you,\" she went on, \"I regretted something I had said.\nI have to make a confession--I must make it!\" she whispered, brokenly,\nthe instinct to indulge in warmth of sentiment which had led this woman\nof passions to respond to Fitzpiers in the first place leading her now\nto find luxurious comfort in opening her heart to his wife.  \"I said to\nyou I could give him up without pain or deprivation--that he had only\nbeen my pastime.  That was untrue--it was said to deceive you.  I could\nnot do it without much pain; and, what is more dreadful, I cannot give\nhim up--even if I would--of myself alone.\"\n\n\"Why? Because you love him, you mean.\"\n\nFelice Charmond denoted assent by a movement.\n\n\"I knew I was right!\" said Grace, exaltedly.  \"But that should not\ndeter you,\" she presently added, in a moral tone.  \"Oh, do struggle\nagainst it, and you will conquer!\"\n\n\"You are so simple, so simple!\" cried Felice.  \"You think, because you\nguessed my assumed indifference to him to be a sham, that you know the\nextremes that people are capable of going to! But a good deal more may\nhave been going on than you have fathomed with all your insight.  I\nCANNOT give him up until he chooses to give up me.\"\n\n\"But surely you are the superior in station and in every way, and the\ncut must come from you.\"\n\n\"Tchut! Must I tell verbatim, you simple child? Oh, I suppose I must! I\nshall eat away my heart if I do not let out all, after meeting you like\nthis and finding how guileless you are.\" She thereupon whispered a few\nwords in the girl's ear, and burst into a violent fit of sobbing.\n\nGrace started roughly away from the shelter of the fur, and sprang to\nher feet.\n\n\"Oh, my God!\" she exclaimed, thunderstruck at a revelation transcending\nher utmost suspicion.  \"Can it be--can it be!\"\n\nShe turned as if to hasten away.  But Felice Charmond's sobs came to\nher ear: deep darkness circled her about, the funereal trees rocked and\nchanted their diriges and placebos around her, and she did not know\nwhich way to go.  After a moment of energy she felt mild again, and\nturned to the motionless woman at her feet.\n\n\"Are you rested?\" she asked, in what seemed something like her own\nvoice grown ten years older.\n\nWithout an answer Mrs. Charmond slowly rose.\n\n\"You mean to betray me!\" she said from the bitterest depths of her\nsoul.  \"Oh fool, fool I!\"\n\n\"No,\" said Grace, shortly.  \"I mean no such thing.  But let us be quick\nnow.  We have a serious undertaking before us.  Think of nothing but\ngoing straight on.\"\n\nThey walked on in profound silence, pulling back boughs now growing\nwet, and treading down woodbine, but still keeping a pretty straight\ncourse.  Grace began to be thoroughly worn out, and her companion too,\nwhen, on a sudden, they broke into the deserted highway at the hill-top\non which the Sherton man had waited for Mrs. Dollery's van.  Grace\nrecognized the spot as soon as she looked around her.\n\n\"How we have got here I cannot tell,\" she said, with cold civility.\n\"We have made a complete circuit of Little Hintock. The hazel copse is\nquite on the other side.  Now we have only to follow the road.\"\n\nThey dragged themselves onward, turned into the lane, passed the track\nto Little Hintock, and so reached the park.\n\n\"Here I turn back,\" said Grace, in the same passionless voice. \"You are\nquite near home.\"\n\nMrs. Charmond stood inert, seeming appalled by her late admission.\n\n\"I have told you something in a moment of irresistible desire to\nunburden my soul which all but a fool would have kept silent as the\ngrave,\" she said.  \"I cannot help it now.  Is it to be a secret--or do\nyou mean war?\"\n\n\"A secret, certainly,\" said Grace, mournfully.  \"How can you expect war\nfrom such a helpless, wretched being as I!\"\n\n\"And I'll do my best not to see him.  I am his slave; but I'll try.\"\n\nGrace was naturally kind; but she could not help using a small dagger\nnow.\n\n\"Pray don't distress yourself,\" she said, with exquisitely fine scorn.\n\"You may keep him--for me.\" Had she been wounded instead of mortified\nshe could not have used the words; but Fitzpiers's hold upon her heart\nwas slight.\n\nThey parted thus and there, and Grace went moodily homeward. Passing\nMarty's cottage she observed through the window that the girl was\nwriting instead of chopping as usual, and wondered what her\ncorrespondence could be.  Directly afterwards she met people in search\nof her, and reached the house to find all in serious alarm.  She soon\nexplained that she had lost her way, and her general depression was\nattributed to exhaustion on that account.\n\nCould she have known what Marty was writing she would have been\nsurprised.\n\nThe rumor which agitated the other folk of Hintock had reached the\nyoung girl, and she was penning a letter to Fitzpiers, to tell him that\nMrs. Charmond wore her hair.  It was poor Marty's only card, and she\nplayed it, knowing nothing of fashion, and thinking her revelation a\nfatal one for a lover.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\n\nIt was at the beginning of April, a few days after the meeting between\nGrace and Mrs. Charmond in the wood, that Fitzpiers, just returned from\nLondon, was travelling from Sherton-Abbas to Hintock in a hired\ncarriage.  In his eye there was a doubtful light, and the lines of his\nrefined face showed a vague disquietude.  He appeared now like one of\nthose who impress the beholder as having suffered wrong in being born.\n\nHis position was in truth gloomy, and to his appreciative mind it\nseemed even gloomier than it was.  His practice had been slowly\ndwindling of late, and now threatened to die out altogether, the\nirrepressible old Dr. Jones capturing patients up to Fitzpiers's very\ndoor.  Fitzpiers knew only too well the latest and greatest cause of\nhis unpopularity; and yet, so illogical is man, the second branch of\nhis sadness grew out of a remedial measure proposed for the first--a\nletter from Felice Charmond imploring him not to see her again.  To\nbring about their severance still more effectually, she added, she had\ndecided during his absence upon almost immediate departure for the\nContinent.\n\nThe time was that dull interval in a woodlander's life which coincides\nwith great activity in the life of the woodland itself--a period\nfollowing the close of the winter tree-cutting, and preceding the\nbarking season, when the saps are just beginning to heave with the\nforce of hydraulic lifts inside all the trunks of the forest.\n\nWinterborne's contract was completed, and the plantations were\ndeserted.  It was dusk; there were no leaves as yet; the nightingales\nwould not begin to sing for a fortnight; and \"the Mother of the Months\"\nwas in her most attenuated phase--starved and bent to a mere bowed\nskeleton, which glided along behind the bare twigs in Fitzpiers's\ncompany.\n\nWhen he reached home he went straight up to his wife's sitting-room.\nHe found it deserted, and without a fire.  He had mentioned no day for\nhis return; nevertheless, he wondered why she was not there waiting to\nreceive him.  On descending to the other wing of the house and\ninquiring of Mrs. Melbury, he learned with much surprise that Grace had\ngone on a visit to an acquaintance at Shottsford-Forum three days\nearlier; that tidings had on this morning reached her father of her\nbeing very unwell there, in consequence of which he had ridden over to\nsee her.\n\nFitzpiers went up-stairs again, and the little drawing-room, now\nlighted by a solitary candle, was not rendered more cheerful by the\nentrance of Grammer Oliver with an apronful of wood, which she threw on\nthe hearth while she raked out the grate and rattled about the\nfire-irons, with a view to making things comfortable. Fitzpiers\nconsidered that Grace ought to have let him know her plans more\naccurately before leaving home in a freak like this. He went\ndesultorily to the window, the blind of which had not been pulled down,\nand looked out at the thin, fast-sinking moon, and at the tall stalk of\nsmoke rising from the top of Suke Damson's chimney, signifying that the\nyoung woman had just lit her fire to prepare supper.\n\nHe became conscious of a discussion in progress on the opposite side of\nthe court.  Somebody had looked over the wall to talk to the sawyers,\nand was telling them in a loud voice news in which the name of Mrs.\nCharmond soon arrested his ears.\n\n\"Grammer, don't make so much noise with that grate,\" said the surgeon;\nat which Grammer reared herself upon her knees and held the fuel\nsuspended in her hand, while Fitzpiers half opened the casement.\n\n\"She is off to foreign lands again at last--hev made up her mind quite\nsudden-like--and it is thoughted she'll leave in a day or two.  She's\nbeen all as if her mind were low for some days past--with a sort of\nsorrow in her face, as if she reproached her own soul.  She's the wrong\nsort of woman for Hintock--hardly knowing a beech from a woak--that I\nown.  But I don't care who the man is, she's been a very kind friend to\nme.\n\n\"Well, the day after to-morrow is the Sabbath day, and without charity\nwe are but tinkling simples; but this I do say, that her going will be\na blessed thing for a certain married couple who remain.\"\n\nThe fire was lighted, and Fitzpiers sat down in front of it, restless\nas the last leaf upon a tree.  \"A sort of sorrow in her face, as if she\nreproached her own soul.\" Poor Felice.  How Felice's frame must be\npulsing under the conditions of which he had just heard the caricature;\nhow her fair temples must ache; what a mood of wretchedness she must be\nin! But for the mixing up of his name with hers, and her determination\nto sunder their too close acquaintance on that account, she would\nprobably have sent for him professionally. She was now sitting alone,\nsuffering, perhaps wishing that she had not forbidden him to come again.\n\nUnable to remain in this lonely room any longer, or to wait for the\nmeal which was in course of preparation, he made himself ready for\nriding, descended to the yard, stood by the stable-door while Darling\nwas being saddled, and rode off down the lane.  He would have preferred\nwalking, but was weary with his day's travel.\n\nAs he approached the door of Marty South's cottage, which it was\nnecessary to pass on his way, she came from the porch as if she had\nbeen awaiting him, and met him in the middle of the road, holding up a\nletter.  Fitzpiers took it without stopping, and asked over his\nshoulder from whom it came.\n\nMarty hesitated.  \"From me,\" she said, shyly, though with noticeable\nfirmness.\n\nThis letter contained, in fact, Marty's declaration that she was the\noriginal owner of Mrs. Charmond's supplementary locks, and enclosed a\nsample from the native stock, which had grown considerably by this\ntime.  It was her long contemplated apple of discord, and much her hand\ntrembled as she handed the document up to him.\n\nBut it was impossible on account of the gloom for Fitzpiers to read it\nthen, while he had the curiosity to do so, and he put it in his pocket.\nHis imagination having already centred itself on Hintock House, in his\npocket the letter remained unopened and forgotten, all the while that\nMarty was hopefully picturing its excellent weaning effect upon him.\n\nHe was not long in reaching the precincts of the Manor House.  He drew\nrein under a group of dark oaks commanding a view of the front, and\nreflected a while.  His entry would not be altogether unnatural in the\ncircumstances of her possible indisposition; but upon the whole he\nthought it best to avoid riding up to the door. By silently approaching\nhe could retreat unobserved in the event of her not being alone.\nThereupon he dismounted, hitched Darling to a stray bough hanging a\nlittle below the general browsing line of the trees, and proceeded to\nthe door on foot.\n\nIn the mean time Melbury had returned from Shottsford-Forum.  The great\ncourt or quadrangle of the timber-merchant's house, divided from the\nshady lane by an ivy-covered wall, was entered by two white gates, one\nstanding near each extremity of the wall.  It so happened that at the\nmoment when Fitzpiers was riding out at the lower gate on his way to\nthe Manor House, Melbury was approaching the upper gate to enter it.\nFitzpiers being in front of Melbury was seen by the latter, but the\nsurgeon, never turning his head, did not observe his father-in-law,\nambling slowly and silently along under the trees, though his horse too\nwas a gray one.\n\n\"How is Grace?\" said his wife, as soon as he entered.\n\nMelbury looked gloomy.  \"She is not at all well,\" he said.  \"I don't\nlike the looks of her at all.  I couldn't bear the notion of her biding\naway in a strange place any longer, and I begged her to let me get her\nhome.  At last she agreed to it, but not till after much persuading.  I\nwas then sorry that I rode over instead of driving; but I have hired a\nnice comfortable carriage--the easiest-going I could get--and she'll be\nhere in a couple of hours or less.  I rode on ahead to tell you to get\nher room ready; but I see her husband has come back.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Melbury.  She expressed her concern that her husband\nhad hired a carriage all the way from Shottsford.  \"What it will cost!\"\nshe said.\n\n\"I don't care what it costs!\" he exclaimed, testily.  \"I was determined\nto get her home.  Why she went away I can't think! She acts in a way\nthat is not at all likely to mend matters as far as I can see.\" (Grace\nhad not told her father of her interview with Mrs. Charmond, and the\ndisclosure that had been whispered in her startled ear.) \"Since Edgar\nis come,\" he continued, \"he might have waited in till I got home, to\nask me how she was, if only for a compliment.  I saw him go out; where\nis he gone?\"\n\nMrs. Melbury did not know positively; but she told her husband that\nthere was not much doubt about the place of his first visit after an\nabsence.  She had, in fact, seen Fitzpiers take the direction of the\nManor House.\n\nMelbury said no more.  It was exasperating to him that just at this\nmoment, when there was every reason for Fitzpiers to stay indoors, or\nat any rate to ride along the Shottsford road to meet his ailing wife,\nhe should be doing despite to her by going elsewhere.  The old man went\nout-of-doors again; and his horse being hardly unsaddled as yet, he\ntold Upjohn to retighten the girths, when he again mounted, and rode\noff at the heels of the surgeon.\n\nBy the time that Melbury reached the park, he was prepared to go any\nlengths in combating this rank and reckless errantry of his daughter's\nhusband.  He would fetch home Edgar Fitzpiers to-night by some means,\nrough or fair: in his view there could come of his interference nothing\nworse than what existed at present.  And yet to every bad there is a\nworse.\n\nHe had entered by the bridle-gate which admitted to the park on this\nside, and cantered over the soft turf almost in the tracks of\nFitzpiers's horse, till he reached the clump of trees under which his\nprecursor had halted.  The whitish object that was indistinctly visible\nhere in the gloom of the boughs he found to be Darling, as left by\nFitzpiers.\n\n\"D--n him! why did he not ride up to the house in an honest way?\" said\nMelbury.\n\nHe profited by Fitzpiers's example; dismounting, he tied his horse\nunder an adjoining tree, and went on to the house on foot, as the other\nhad done.  He was no longer disposed to stick at trifles in his\ninvestigation, and did not hesitate to gently open the front door\nwithout ringing.\n\nThe large square hall, with its oak floor, staircase, and wainscot, was\nlighted by a dim lamp hanging from a beam.  Not a soul was visible.  He\nwent into the corridor and listened at a door which he knew to be that\nof the drawing-room; there was no sound, and on turning the handle he\nfound the room empty.  A fire burning low in the grate was the sole\nlight of the apartment; its beams flashed mockingly on the somewhat\nshowy Versaillese furniture and gilding here, in style as unlike that\nof the structural parts of the building as it was possible to be, and\nprobably introduced by Felice to counteract the fine old-English gloom\nof the place.  Disappointed in his hope of confronting his son-in-law\nhere, he went on to the dining-room; this was without light or fire,\nand pervaded by a cold atmosphere, which signified that she had not\ndined there that day.\n\nBy this time Melbury's mood had a little mollified.  Everything here\nwas so pacific, so unaggressive in its repose, that he was no longer\nincited to provoke a collision with Fitzpiers or with anybody.  The\ncomparative stateliness of the apartments influenced him to an emotion,\nrather than to a belief, that where all was outwardly so good and\nproper there could not be quite that delinquency within which he had\nsuspected.  It occurred to him, too, that even if his suspicion were\njustified, his abrupt, if not unwarrantable, entry into the house might\nend in confounding its inhabitant at the expense of his daughter's\ndignity and his own. Any ill result would be pretty sure to hit Grace\nhardest in the long-run.  He would, after all, adopt the more rational\ncourse, and plead with Fitzpiers privately, as he had pleaded with Mrs.\nCharmond.\n\nHe accordingly retreated as silently as he had come.  Passing the door\nof the drawing-room anew, he fancied that he heard a noise within which\nwas not the crackling of the fire.  Melbury gently reopened the door to\na distance of a few inches, and saw at the opposite window two figures\nin the act of stepping out--a man and a woman--in whom he recognized\nthe lady of the house and his son-in-law.  In a moment they had\ndisappeared amid the gloom of the lawn.\n\nHe returned into the hall, and let himself out by the carriage-entrance\ndoor, coming round to the lawn front in time to see the two figures\nparting at the railing which divided the precincts of the house from\nthe open park.  Mrs. Charmond turned to hasten back immediately that\nFitzpiers had left her side, and he was speedily absorbed into the\nduskiness of the trees.\n\nMelbury waited till Mrs. Charmond had re-entered the drawing-room, and\nthen followed after Fitzpiers, thinking that he would allow the latter\nto mount and ride ahead a little way before overtaking him and giving\nhim a piece of his mind.  His son-in-law might possibly see the second\nhorse near his own; but that would do him no harm, and might prepare\nhim for what he was to expect.\n\nThe event, however, was different from the plan.  On plunging into the\nthick shade of the clump of oaks, he could not perceive his horse\nBlossom anywhere; but feeling his way carefully along, he by-and-by\ndiscerned Fitzpiers's mare Darling still standing as before under the\nadjoining tree.  For a moment Melbury thought that his own horse, being\nyoung and strong, had broken away from her fastening; but on listening\nintently he could hear her ambling comfortably along a little way\nahead, and a creaking of the saddle which showed that she had a rider.\nWalking on as far as the small gate in the corner of the park, he met a\nlaborer, who, in reply to Melbury's inquiry if he had seen any person\non a gray horse, said that he had only met Dr. Fitzpiers.\n\nIt was just what Melbury had begun to suspect: Fitzpiers had mounted\nthe mare which did not belong to him in mistake for his own--an\noversight easily explicable, in a man ever unwitting in horse-flesh, by\nthe darkness of the spot and the near similarity of the animals in\nappearance, though Melbury's was readily enough seen to be the grayer\nhorse by day.  He hastened back, and did what seemed best in the\ncircumstances--got upon old Darling, and rode rapidly after Fitzpiers.\n\nMelbury had just entered the wood, and was winding along the cart-way\nwhich led through it, channelled deep in the leaf-mould with large ruts\nthat were formed by the timber-wagons in fetching the spoil of the\nplantations, when all at once he descried in front, at a point where\nthe road took a turning round a large chestnut-tree, the form of his\nown horse Blossom, at which Melbury quickened Darling's pace, thinking\nto come up with Fitzpiers.\n\nNearer view revealed that the horse had no rider.  At Melbury's\napproach it galloped friskily away under the trees in a homeward\ndirection.  Thinking something was wrong, the timber-merchant\ndismounted as soon as he reached the chestnut, and after feeling about\nfor a minute or two discovered Fitzpiers lying on the ground.\n\n\"Here--help!\" cried the latter as soon as he felt Melbury's touch; \"I\nhave been thrown off, but there's not much harm done, I think.\"\n\nSince Melbury could not now very well read the younger man the lecture\nhe had intended, and as friendliness would be hypocrisy, his instinct\nwas to speak not a single word to his son-in-law.  He raised Fitzpiers\ninto a sitting posture, and found that he was a little stunned and\nstupefied, but, as he had said, not otherwise hurt.  How this fall had\ncome about was readily conjecturable: Fitzpiers, imagining there was\nonly old Darling under him, had been taken unawares by the younger\nhorse's sprightliness.\n\nMelbury was a traveller of the old-fashioned sort; having just come\nfrom Shottsford-Forum, he still had in his pocket the pilgrim's flask\nof rum which he always carried on journeys exceeding a dozen miles,\nthough he seldom drank much of it.  He poured it down the surgeon's\nthroat, with such effect that he quickly revived.  Melbury got him on\nhis legs; but the question was what to do with him.  He could not walk\nmore than a few steps, and the other horse had gone away.\n\nWith great exertion Melbury contrived to get him astride Darling,\nmounting himself behind, and holding Fitzpiers round his waist with one\narm.  Darling being broad, straight-backed, and high in the withers,\nwas well able to carry double, at any rate as far as Hintock, and at a\ngentle pace.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV.\n\nThe mare paced along with firm and cautious tread through the copse\nwhere Winterborne had worked, and into the heavier soil where the oaks\ngrew; past Great Willy, the largest oak in the wood, and thence towards\nNellcombe Bottom, intensely dark now with overgrowth, and popularly\nsupposed to be haunted by the spirits of the fratricides exorcised from\nHintock House.\n\nBy this time Fitzpiers was quite recovered as to physical strength.\nBut he had eaten nothing since making a hasty breakfast in London that\nmorning, his anxiety about Felice having hurried him away from home\nbefore dining; as a consequence, the old rum administered by his\nfather-in-law flew to the young man's head and loosened his tongue,\nwithout his ever having recognized who it was that had lent him a\nkindly hand.  He began to speak in desultory sentences, Melbury still\nsupporting him.\n\n\"I've come all the way from London to-day,\" said Fitzpiers.  \"Ah,\nthat's the place to meet your equals.  I live at Hintock--worse, at\nLittle Hintock--and I am quite lost there.  There's not a man within\nten miles of Hintock who can comprehend me.  I tell you, Farmer\nWhat's-your-name, that I'm a man of education.  I know several\nlanguages; the poets and I are familiar friends; I used to read more in\nmetaphysics than anybody within fifty miles; and since I gave that up\nthere's nobody can match me in the whole county of Wessex as a\nscientist.  Yet I an doomed to live with tradespeople in a miserable\nlittle hole like Hintock!\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" muttered Melbury.\n\nFitzpiers, increasingly energized by the alcohol, here reared himself\nup suddenly from the bowed posture he had hitherto held, thrusting his\nshoulders so violently against Melbury's breast as to make it difficult\nfor the old man to keep a hold on the reins. \"People don't appreciate\nme here!\" the surgeon exclaimed; lowering his voice, he added, softly\nand slowly, \"except one--except one!...A passionate soul, as warm as\nshe is clever, as beautiful as she is warm, and as rich as she is\nbeautiful.  I say, old fellow, those claws of yours clutch me rather\ntight--rather like the eagle's, you know, that ate out the liver of\nPro--Pre--the man on Mount Caucasus.  People don't appreciate me, I\nsay, except HER. Ah, gods, I am an unlucky man!  She would have been\nmine, she would have taken my name; but unfortunately it cannot be so.\nI stooped to mate beneath me, and now I rue it.\"\n\nThe position was becoming a very trying one for Melbury, corporeally\nand mentally.  He was obliged to steady Fitzpiers with his left arm,\nand he began to hate the contact.  He hardly knew what to do.  It was\nuseless to remonstrate with Fitzpiers, in his intellectual confusion\nfrom the rum and from the fall.  He remained silent, his hold upon his\ncompanion, however, being stern rather than compassionate.\n\n\"You hurt me a little, farmer--though I am much obliged to you for your\nkindness.  People don't appreciate me, I say.  Between ourselves, I am\nlosing my practice here; and why?  Because I see matchless attraction\nwhere matchless attraction is, both in person and position.  I mention\nno names, so nobody will be the wiser. But I have lost her, in a\nlegitimate sense, that is.  If I were a free man now, things have come\nto such a pass that she could not refuse me; while with her fortune\n(which I don't covet for itself) I should have a chance of satisfying\nan honorable ambition--a chance I have never had yet, and now never,\nnever shall have, probably!\"\n\nMelbury, his heart throbbing against the other's backbone, and his\nbrain on fire with indignation, ventured to mutter huskily, \"Why?\"\n\nThe horse ambled on some steps before Fitzpiers replied, \"Because I am\ntied and bound to another by law, as tightly as I am to you by your\narm--not that I complain of your arm--I thank you for helping me.\nWell, where are we?  Not nearly home yet?...Home, say I.  It is a home!\nWhen I might have been at the other house over there.\"  In a stupefied\nway he flung his hand in the direction of the park.  \"I was just two\nmonths too early in committing myself. Had I only seen the other\nfirst--\"\n\nHere the old man's arm gave Fitzpiers a convulsive shake.  \"What are\nyou doing?\" continued the latter.  \"Keep still, please, or put me down.\nI was saying that I lost her by a mere little two months! There is no\nchance for me now in this world, and it makes me reckless--reckless!\nUnless, indeed, anything should happen to the other one.  She is\namiable enough; but if anything should happen to her--and I hear she is\nill--well, if it should, I should be free--and my fame, my happiness,\nwould be insured.\"\n\nThese were the last words that Fitzpiers uttered in his seat in front\nof the timber-merchant.  Unable longer to master himself, Melbury, the\nskin of his face compressed, whipped away his spare arm from\nFitzpiers's waist, and seized him by the collar.\n\n\"You heartless villain--after all that we have done for ye!\" he cried,\nwith a quivering lip.  \"And the money of hers that you've had, and the\nroof we've provided to shelter ye! It is to me, George Melbury, that\nyou dare to talk like that!\" The exclamation was accompanied by a\npowerful swing from the shoulder, which flung the young man head-long\ninto the road, Fitzpiers fell with a heavy thud upon the stumps of some\nundergrowth which had been cut during the winter preceding.  Darling\ncontinued her walk for a few paces farther and stopped.\n\n\"God forgive me!\" Melbury murmured, repenting of what he had done. \"He\ntried me too sorely; and now perhaps I've murdered him!\"\n\nHe turned round in the saddle and looked towards the spot on which\nFitzpiers had fallen.  To his great surprise he beheld the surgeon rise\nto his feet with a bound, as if unhurt, and walk away rapidly under the\ntrees.\n\nMelbury listened till the rustle of Fitzpiers's footsteps died away.\n\"It might have been a crime, but for the mercy of Providence in\nproviding leaves for his fall,\" he said to himself. And then his mind\nreverted to the words of Fitzpiers, and his indignation so mounted\nwithin him that he almost wished the fall had put an end to the young\nman there and then.\n\nHe had not ridden far when he discerned his own gray mare standing\nunder some bushes.  Leaving Darling for a moment, Melbury went forward\nand easily caught the younger animal, now disheartened at its freak.\nHe then made the pair of them fast to a tree, and turning back,\nendeavored to find some trace of Fitzpiers, feeling pitifully that,\nafter all, he had gone further than he intended with the offender.\n\nBut though he threaded the wood hither and thither, his toes ploughing\nlayer after layer of the little horny scrolls that had once been\nleaves, he could not find him.  He stood still listening and looking\nround.  The breeze was oozing through the network of boughs as through\na strainer; the trunks and larger branches stood against the light of\nthe sky in the forms of writhing men, gigantic candelabra, pikes,\nhalberds, lances, and whatever besides the fancy chose to make of them.\nGiving up the search, Melbury came back to the horses, and walked\nslowly homeward, leading one in each hand.\n\n\nIt happened that on this self-same evening a boy had been returning\nfrom Great to Little Hintock about the time of Fitzpiers's and\nMelbury's passage home along that route.  A horse-collar that had been\nleft at the harness-mender's to be repaired was required for use at\nfive o'clock next morning, and in consequence the boy had to fetch it\novernight.  He put his head through the collar, and accompanied his\nwalk by whistling the one tune he knew, as an antidote to fear.\n\nThe boy suddenly became aware of a horse trotting rather friskily along\nthe track behind him, and not knowing whether to expect friend or foe,\nprudence suggested that he should cease his whistling and retreat among\nthe trees till the horse and his rider had gone by; a course to which\nhe was still more inclined when he found how noiselessly they\napproached, and saw that the horse looked pale, and remembered what he\nhad read about Death in the Revelation.  He therefore deposited the\ncollar by a tree, and hid himself behind it.  The horseman came on, and\nthe youth, whose eyes were as keen as telescopes, to his great relief\nrecognized the doctor.\n\nAs Melbury surmised, Fitzpiers had in the darkness taken Blossom for\nDarling, and he had not discovered his mistake when he came up opposite\nthe boy, though he was somewhat surprised at the liveliness of his\nusually placid mare.  The only other pair of eyes on the spot whose\nvision was keen as the young carter's were those of the horse; and,\nwith that strongly conservative objection to the unusual which animals\nshow, Blossom, on eying the collar under the tree--quite invisible to\nFitzpiers--exercised none of the patience of the older horse, but shied\nsufficiently to unseat so second-rate an equestrian as the surgeon.\n\nHe fell, and did not move, lying as Melbury afterwards found him. The\nboy ran away, salving his conscience for the desertion by thinking how\nvigorously he would spread the alarm of the accident when he got to\nHintock--which he uncompromisingly did, incrusting the skeleton event\nwith a load of dramatic horrors.\n\nGrace had returned, and the fly hired on her account, though not by her\nhusband, at the Crown Hotel, Shottsford-Forum, had been paid for and\ndismissed.  The long drive had somewhat revived her, her illness being\na feverish intermittent nervousness which had more to do with mind than\nbody, and she walked about her sitting-room in something of a hopeful\nmood.  Mrs. Melbury had told her as soon as she arrived that her\nhusband had returned from London.  He had gone out, she said, to see a\npatient, as she supposed, and he must soon be back, since he had had no\ndinner or tea.  Grace would not allow her mind to harbor any suspicion\nof his whereabouts, and her step-mother said nothing of Mrs. Charmond's\nrumored sorrows and plans of departure.\n\nSo the young wife sat by the fire, waiting silently.  She had left\nHintock in a turmoil of feeling after the revelation of Mrs. Charmond,\nand had intended not to be at home when her husband returned.  But she\nhad thought the matter over, and had allowed her father's influence to\nprevail and bring her back; and now somewhat regretted that Edgar's\narrival had preceded hers.\n\nBy-and-by Mrs. Melbury came up-stairs with a slight air of flurry and\nabruptness.\n\n\"I have something to tell--some bad news,\" she said.  \"But you must not\nbe alarmed, as it is not so bad as it might have been. Edgar has been\nthrown off his horse.  We don't think he is hurt much.  It happened in\nthe wood the other side of Nellcombe Bottom, where 'tis said the ghosts\nof the brothers walk.\"\n\nShe went on to give a few of the particulars, but none of the invented\nhorrors that had been communicated by the boy.  \"I thought it better to\ntell you at once,\" she added, \"in case he should not be very well able\nto walk home, and somebody should bring him.\"\n\nMrs. Melbury really thought matters much worse than she represented,\nand Grace knew that she thought so.  She sat down dazed for a few\nminutes, returning a negative to her step-mother's inquiry if she could\ndo anything for her.  \"But please go into the bedroom,\" Grace said, on\nsecond thoughts, \"and see if all is ready there--in case it is\nserious.\" Mrs. Melbury thereupon called Grammer, and they did as\ndirected, supplying the room with everything they could think of for\nthe accommodation of an injured man.\n\nNobody was left in the lower part of the house.  Not many minutes\npassed when Grace heard a knock at the door--a single knock, not loud\nenough to reach the ears of those in the bedroom.  She went to the top\nof the stairs and said, faintly, \"Come up,\" knowing that the door\nstood, as usual in such houses, wide open.\n\nRetreating into the gloom of the broad landing she saw rise up the\nstairs a woman whom at first she did not recognize, till her voice\nrevealed her to be Suke Damson, in great fright and sorrow.  A streak\nof light from the partially closed door of Grace's room fell upon her\nface as she came forward, and it was drawn and pale.\n\n\"Oh, Miss Melbury--I would say Mrs. Fitzpiers,\" she said, wringing her\nhands.  \"This terrible news.  Is he dead? Is he hurted very bad? Tell\nme; I couldn't help coming; please forgive me, Miss Melbury--Mrs.\nFitzpiers I would say!\"\n\nGrace sank down on the oak chest which stood on the landing, and put\nher hands to her now flushed face and head.  Could she order Suke\nDamson down-stairs and out of the house? Her husband might be brought\nin at any moment, and what would happen? But could she order this\ngenuinely grieved woman away?\n\nThere was a dead silence of half a minute or so, till Suke said, \"Why\ndon't ye speak? Is he here? Is he dead? If so, why can't I see\nhim--would it be so very wrong?\"\n\nBefore Grace had answered somebody else came to the door below--a\nfoot-fall light as a roe's.  There was a hurried tapping upon the\npanel, as if with the impatient tips of fingers whose owner thought not\nwhether a knocker were there or no.  Without a pause, and possibly\nguided by the stray beam of light on the landing, the newcomer ascended\nthe staircase as the first had done.  Grace was sufficiently visible,\nand the lady, for a lady it was, came to her side.\n\n\"I could make nobody hear down-stairs,\" said Felice Charmond, with lips\nwhose dryness could almost be heard, and panting, as she stood like one\nready to sink on the floor with distress.  \"What is--the matter--tell\nme the worst! Can he live?\" She looked at Grace imploringly, without\nperceiving poor Suke, who, dismayed at such a presence, had shrunk away\ninto the shade.\n\nMrs. Charmond's little feet were covered with mud; she was quite\nunconscious of her appearance now.  \"I have heard such a dreadful\nreport,\" she went on; \"I came to ascertain the truth of it.  Is\nhe--killed?\"\n\n\"She won't tell us--he's dying--he's in that room!\" burst out Suke,\nregardless of consequences, as she heard the distant movements of Mrs.\nMelbury and Grammer in the bedroom at the end of the passage.\n\n\"Where?\" said Mrs. Charmond; and on Suke pointing out the direction,\nshe made as if to go thither.\n\nGrace barred the way.  \"He is not there,\" she said.  \"I have not seen\nhim any more than you.  I have heard a report only--not so bad as you\nthink.  It must have been exaggerated to you.\"\n\n\"Please do not conceal anything--let me know all!\" said Felice,\ndoubtingly.\n\n\"You shall know all I know--you have a perfect right to know--who can\nhave a better than either of you?\" said Grace, with a delicate sting\nwhich was lost upon Felice Charmond now.  \"I repeat, I have only heard\na less alarming account than you have heard; how much it means, and how\nlittle, I cannot say.  I pray God that it means not much--in common\nhumanity.  You probably pray the same--for other reasons.\"\n\nShe regarded them both there in the dim light a while.\n\nThey stood dumb in their trouble, not stinging back at her; not heeding\nher mood.  A tenderness spread over Grace like a dew.  It was well,\nvery well, conventionally, to address either one of them in the wife's\nregulation terms of virtuous sarcasm, as woman, creature, or thing, for\nlosing their hearts to her husband.  But life, what was it, and who was\nshe?  She had, like the singer of the psalm of Asaph, been plagued and\nchastened all the day long; but could she, by retributive words, in\norder to please herself--the individual--\"offend against the\ngeneration,\" as he would not?\n\n\"He is dying, perhaps,\" blubbered Suke Damson, putting her apron to her\neyes.\n\nIn their gestures and faces there were anxieties, affection, agony of\nheart, all for a man who had wronged them--had never really behaved\ntowards either of them anyhow but selfishly.  Neither one but would\nhave wellnigh sacrificed half her life to him, even now. The tears\nwhich his possibly critical situation could not bring to her eyes\nsurged over at the contemplation of these fellow-women. She turned to\nthe balustrade, bent herself upon it, and wept.\n\nThereupon Felice began to cry also, without using her handkerchief, and\nletting the tears run down silently.  While these three poor women\nstood together thus, pitying another though most to be pitied\nthemselves, the pacing of a horse or horses became audible in the\ncourt, and in a moment Melbury's voice was heard calling to his\nstableman.  Grace at once started up, ran down the stairs and out into\nthe quadrangle as her father crossed it towards the door.  \"Father,\nwhat is the matter with him?\" she cried.\n\n\"Who--Edgar?\" said Melbury, abruptly.  \"Matter? Nothing.  What, my\ndear, and have you got home safe? Why, you are better already! But you\nought not to be out in the air like this.\"\n\n\"But he has been thrown off his horse!\"\n\n\"I know; I know.  I saw it.  He got up again, and walked off as well as\never.  A fall on the leaves didn't hurt a spry fellow like him.  He did\nnot come this way,\" he added, significantly.  \"I suppose he went to\nlook for his horse.  I tried to find him, but could not.  But after\nseeing him go away under the trees I found the horse, and have led it\nhome for safety.  So he must walk. Now, don't you stay out here in this\nnight air.\"\n\nShe returned to the house with her father.  When she had again ascended\nto the landing and to her own rooms beyond it was a great relief to her\nto find that both Petticoat the First and Petticoat the Second of her\nBien-aime had silently disappeared.  They had, in all probability,\nheard the words of her father, and departed with their anxieties\nrelieved.\n\nPresently her parents came up to Grace, and busied themselves to see\nthat she was comfortable.  Perceiving soon that she would prefer to be\nleft alone they went away.\n\nGrace waited on.  The clock raised its voice now and then, but her\nhusband did not return.  At her father's usual hour for retiring he\nagain came in to see her.  \"Do not stay up,\" she said, as soon as he\nentered.  \"I am not at all tired.  I will sit up for him.\"\n\n\"I think it will be useless, Grace,\" said Melbury, slowly.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"I have had a bitter quarrel with him; and on that account I hardly\nthink he will return to-night.\"\n\n\"A quarrel?  Was that after the fall seen by the boy?\"\n\nMelbury nodded an affirmative, without taking his eyes off the candle.\n\n\"Yes; it was as we were coming home together,\" he said.\n\nSomething had been swelling up in Grace while her father was speaking.\n\"How could you want to quarrel with him?\" she cried, suddenly.  \"Why\ncould you not let him come home quietly if he were inclined to?  He is\nmy husband; and now you have married me to him surely you need not\nprovoke him unnecessarily.  First you induce me to accept him, and then\nyou do things that divide us more than we should naturally be divided!\"\n\n\"How can you speak so unjustly to me, Grace?\" said Melbury, with\nindignant sorrow.  \"I divide you from your husband, indeed!  You little\nthink--\"\n\nHe was inclined to say more--to tell her the whole story of the\nencounter, and that the provocation he had received had lain entirely\nin hearing her despised.  But it would have greatly distressed her, and\nhe forbore.  \"You had better lie down.  You are tired,\" he said,\nsoothingly.  \"Good-night.\"\n\nThe household went to bed, and a silence fell upon the dwelling, broken\nonly by the occasional skirr of a halter in Melbury's stables.  Despite\nher father's advice Grace still waited up.  But nobody came.\n\nIt was a critical time in Grace's emotional life that night.  She\nthought of her husband a good deal, and for the nonce forgot\nWinterborne.\n\n\"How these unhappy women must have admired Edgar!\" she said to herself.\n\"How attractive he must be to everybody; and, indeed, he is\nattractive.\" The possibility is that, piqued by rivalry, these ideas\nmight have been transformed into their corresponding emotions by a show\nof the least reciprocity in Fitzpiers.  There was, in truth, a\nlove-bird yearning to fly from her heart; and it wanted a lodging badly.\n\nBut no husband came.  The fact was that Melbury had been much mistaken\nabout the condition of Fitzpiers.  People do not fall headlong on\nstumps of underwood with impunity.  Had the old man been able to watch\nFitzpiers narrowly enough, he would have observed that on rising and\nwalking into the thicket he dropped blood as he went; that he had not\nproceeded fifty yards before he showed signs of being dizzy, and,\nraising his hands to his head, reeled and fell down.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\n\nGrace was not the only one who watched and meditated in Hintock that\nnight.  Felice Charmond was in no mood to retire to rest at a customary\nhour; and over her drawing-room fire at the Manor House she sat as\nmotionless and in as deep a reverie as Grace in her little apartment at\nthe homestead.\n\nHaving caught ear of Melbury's intelligence while she stood on the\nlanding at his house, and been eased of much of her mental distress,\nher sense of personal decorum returned upon her with a rush.  She\ndescended the stairs and left the door like a ghost, keeping close to\nthe walls of the building till she got round to the gate of the\nquadrangle, through which she noiselessly passed almost before Grace\nand her father had finished their discourse. Suke Damson had thought it\nwell to imitate her superior in this respect, and, descending the back\nstairs as Felice descended the front, went out at the side door and\nhome to her cottage.\n\nOnce outside Melbury's gates Mrs. Charmond ran with all her speed to\nthe Manor House, without stopping or turning her head, and splitting\nher thin boots in her haste.  She entered her own dwelling, as she had\nemerged from it, by the drawing-room window. In other circumstances she\nwould have felt some timidity at undertaking such an unpremeditated\nexcursion alone; but her anxiety for another had cast out her fear for\nherself.\n\nEverything in her drawing-room was just as she had left it--the candles\nstill burning, the casement closed, and the shutters gently pulled to,\nso as to hide the state of the window from the cursory glance of a\nservant entering the apartment.  She had been gone about three-quarters\nof an hour by the clock, and nobody seemed to have discovered her\nabsence.  Tired in body but tense in mind, she sat down, palpitating,\nround-eyed, bewildered at what she had done.\n\nShe had been betrayed by affrighted love into a visit which, now that\nthe emotion instigating it had calmed down under her belief that\nFitzpiers was in no danger, was the saddest surprise to her. This was\nhow she had set about doing her best to escape her passionate bondage\nto him! Somehow, in declaring to Grace and to herself the unseemliness\nof her infatuation, she had grown a convert to its irresistibility.  If\nHeaven would only give her strength; but Heaven never did! One thing\nwas indispensable; she must go away from Hintock if she meant to\nwithstand further temptation.  The struggle was too wearying, too\nhopeless, while she remained.  It was but a continual capitulation of\nconscience to what she dared not name.\n\nBy degrees, as she sat, Felice's mind--helped perhaps by the anticlimax\nof learning that her lover was unharmed after all her fright about\nhim--grew wondrously strong in wise resolve.  For the moment she was in\na mood, in the words of Mrs. Elizabeth Montagu, \"to run mad with\ndiscretion;\" and was so persuaded that discretion lay in departure that\nshe wished to set about going that very minute.  Jumping up from her\nseat, she began to gather together some small personal knick-knacks\nscattered about the room, to feel that preparations were really in\ntrain.\n\nWhile moving here and there she fancied that she heard a slight noise\nout-of-doors, and stood still.  Surely it was a tapping at the window.\nA thought entered her mind, and burned her cheek.  He had come to that\nwindow before; yet was it possible that he should dare to do so now!\nAll the servants were in bed, and in the ordinary course of affairs she\nwould have retired also.  Then she remembered that on stepping in by\nthe casement and closing it, she had not fastened the window-shutter,\nso that a streak of light from the interior of the room might have\nrevealed her vigil to an observer on the lawn.  How all things\nconspired against her keeping faith with Grace!\n\nThe tapping recommenced, light as from the bill of a little bird; her\nillegitimate hope overcame her vow; she went and pulled back the\nshutter, determining, however, to shake her head at him and keep the\ncasement securely closed.\n\nWhat she saw outside might have struck terror into a heart stouter than\na helpless woman's at midnight.  In the centre of the lowest pane of\nthe window, close to the glass, was a human face, which she barely\nrecognized as the face of Fitzpiers.  It was surrounded with the\ndarkness of the night without, corpse-like in its pallor, and covered\nwith blood.  As disclosed in the square area of the pane it met her\nfrightened eyes like a replica of the Sudarium of St. Veronica.\n\nHe moved his lips, and looked at her imploringly.  Her rapid mind\npieced together in an instant a possible concatenation of events which\nmight have led to this tragical issue.  She unlatched the casement with\na terrified hand, and bending down to where he was crouching, pressed\nher face to his with passionate solicitude. She assisted him into the\nroom without a word, to do which it was almost necessary to lift him\nbodily.  Quickly closing the window and fastening the shutters, she\nbent over him breathlessly.\n\n\"Are you hurt much--much?\" she cried, faintly.  \"Oh, oh, how is this!\"\n\n\"Rather much--but don't be frightened,\" he answered in a difficult\nwhisper, and turning himself to obtain an easier position if possible.\n\"A little water, please.\"\n\nShe ran across into the dining-room, and brought a bottle and glass,\nfrom which he eagerly drank.  He could then speak much better, and with\nher help got upon the nearest couch.\n\n\"Are you dying, Edgar?\" she said.  \"Do speak to me!\"\n\n\"I am half dead,\" said Fitzpiers.  \"But perhaps I shall get over\nit....It is chiefly loss of blood.\"\n\n\"But I thought your fall did not hurt you,\" said she.  \"Who did this?\"\n\n\"Felice--my father-in-law!...I have crawled to you more than a mile on\nmy hands and knees--God, I thought I should never have got here!...I\nhave come to you--be-cause you are the only friend--I have in the world\nnow....I can never go back to Hintock--never--to the roof of the\nMelburys! Not poppy nor mandragora will ever medicine this bitter\nfeud!...If I were only well again--\"\n\n\"Let me bind your head, now that you have rested.\"\n\n\"Yes--but wait a moment--it has stopped bleeding, fortunately, or I\nshould be a dead man before now.  While in the wood I managed to make a\ntourniquet of some half-pence and my handkerchief, as well as I could\nin the dark....But listen, dear Felice! Can you hide me till I am well?\nWhatever comes, I can be seen in Hintock no more. My practice is nearly\ngone, you know--and after this I would not care to recover it if I\ncould.\"\n\nBy this time Felice's tears began to blind her.  Where were now her\ndiscreet plans for sundering their lives forever? To administer to him\nin his pain, and trouble, and poverty, was her single thought.  The\nfirst step was to hide him, and she asked herself where.  A place\noccurred to her mind.\n\nShe got him some wine from the dining-room, which strengthened him\nmuch.  Then she managed to remove his boots, and, as he could now keep\nhimself upright by leaning upon her on one side and a walking-stick on\nthe other, they went thus in slow march out of the room and up the\nstairs.  At the top she took him along a gallery, pausing whenever he\nrequired rest, and thence up a smaller staircase to the least used part\nof the house, where she unlocked a door.  Within was a lumber-room,\ncontaining abandoned furniture of all descriptions, built up in piles\nwhich obscured the light of the windows, and formed between them nooks\nand lairs in which a person would not be discerned even should an eye\ngaze in at the door.  The articles were mainly those that had belonged\nto the previous owner of the house, and had been bought in by the late\nMr. Charmond at the auction; but changing fashion, and the tastes of a\nyoung wife, had caused them to be relegated to this dungeon.\n\nHere Fitzpiers sat on the floor against the wall till she had hauled\nout materials for a bed, which she spread on the floor in one of the\naforesaid nooks.  She obtained water and a basin, and washed the dried\nblood from his face and hands; and when he was comfortably reclining,\nfetched food from the larder.  While he ate her eyes lingered anxiously\non his face, following its every movement with such loving-kindness as\nonly a fond woman can show.\n\nHe was now in better condition, and discussed his position with her.\n\n\"What I fancy I said to Melbury must have been enough to enrage any\nman, if uttered in cold blood, and with knowledge of his presence.  But\nI did not know him, and I was stupefied by what he had given me, so\nthat I hardly was aware of what I said.  Well--the veil of that temple\nis rent in twain!...As I am not going to be seen again in Hintock, my\nfirst efforts must be directed to allay any alarm that may be felt at\nmy absence, before I am able to get clear away.  Nobody must suspect\nthat I have been hurt, or there will be a country talk about me.\nFelice, I must at once concoct a letter to check all search for me.  I\nthink if you can bring me a pen and paper I may be able to do it now.\nI could rest better if it were done.  Poor thing! how I tire her with\nrunning up and down!\"\n\nShe fetched writing materials, and held up the blotting-book as a\nsupport to his hand, while he penned a brief note to his nominal wife.\n\n\"The animosity shown towards me by your father,\" he wrote, in this\ncoldest of marital epistles, \"is such that I cannot return again to a\nroof which is his, even though it shelters you.  A parting is\nunavoidable, as you are sure to be on his side in this division. I am\nstarting on a journey which will take me a long way from Hintock, and\nyou must not expect to see me there again for some time.\"\n\nHe then gave her a few directions bearing upon his professional\nengagements and other practical matters, concluding without a hint of\nhis destination, or a notion of when she would see him again. He\noffered to read the note to Felice before he closed it up, but she\nwould not hear or see it; that side of his obligations distressed her\nbeyond endurance.  She turned away from Fitzpiers, and sobbed bitterly.\n\n\"If you can get this posted at a place some miles away,\" he whispered,\nexhausted by the effort of writing--\"at Shottsford or Port-Bredy, or\nstill better, Budmouth--it will divert all suspicion from this house as\nthe place of my refuge.\"\n\n\"I will drive to one or other of the places myself--anything to keep it\nunknown,\" she murmured, her voice weighted with vague foreboding, now\nthat the excitement of helping him had passed away.\n\nFitzpiers told her that there was yet one thing more to be done. \"In\ncreeping over the fence on to the lawn,\" he said, \"I made the rail\nbloody, and it shows rather much on the white paint--I could see it in\nthe dark.  At all hazards it should be washed off. Could you do that\nalso, Felice?\"\n\nWhat will not women do on such devoted occasions? weary as she was she\nwent all the way down the rambling staircases to the ground-floor,\nthen to search for a lantern, which she lighted and hid under her\ncloak; then for a wet sponge, and next went forth into the night.  The\nwhite railing stared out in the darkness at her approach, and a ray\nfrom the enshrouded lantern fell upon the blood--just where he had told\nher it would be found.  She shuddered.  It was almost too much to bear\nin one day--but with a shaking hand she sponged the rail clean, and\nreturned to the house.\n\nThe time occupied by these several proceedings was not much less than\ntwo hours.  When all was done, and she had smoothed his extemporized\nbed, and placed everything within his reach that she could think of,\nshe took her leave of him, and locked him in.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\n\nWhen her husband's letter reached Grace's hands, bearing upon it the\npostmark of a distant town, it never once crossed her mind that\nFitzpiers was within a mile of her still.  She felt relieved that he\ndid not write more bitterly of the quarrel with her father, whatever\nits nature might have been; but the general frigidity of his\ncommunication quenched in her the incipient spark that events had\nkindled so shortly before.\n\nFrom this centre of information it was made known in Hintock that the\ndoctor had gone away, and as none but the Melbury household was aware\nthat he did not return on the night of his accident, no excitement\nmanifested itself in the village.\n\nThus the early days of May passed by.  None but the nocturnal birds and\nanimals observed that late one evening, towards the middle of the\nmonth, a closely wrapped figure, with a crutch under one arm and a\nstick in his hand, crept out from Hintock House across the lawn to the\nshelter of the trees, taking thence a slow and laborious walk to the\nnearest point of the turnpike-road.  The mysterious personage was so\ndisguised that his own wife would hardly have known him.  Felice\nCharmond was a practised hand at make-ups, as well she might be; and\nshe had done her utmost in padding and painting Fitzpiers with the old\nmaterials of her art in the recesses of the lumber-room.\n\nIn the highway he was met by a covered carriage, which conveyed him to\nSherton-Abbas, whence he proceeded to the nearest port on the south\ncoast, and immediately crossed the Channel.\n\nBut it was known to everybody that three days after this time Mrs.\nCharmond executed her long-deferred plan of setting out for a long term\nof travel and residence on the Continent.  She went off one morning as\nunostentatiously as could be, and took no maid with her, having, she\nsaid, engaged one to meet her at a point farther on in her route.\nAfter that, Hintock House, so frequently deserted, was again to be let.\nSpring had not merged in summer when a clinching rumor, founded on the\nbest of evidence, reached the parish and neighborhood.  Mrs. Charmond\nand Fitzpiers had been seen together in Baden, in relations which set\nat rest the question that had agitated the little community ever since\nthe winter.\n\nMelbury had entered the Valley of Humiliation even farther than Grace.\nHis spirit seemed broken.\n\nBut once a week he mechanically went to market as usual, and here, as\nhe was passing by the conduit one day, his mental condition expressed\nlargely by his gait, he heard his name spoken by a voice formerly\nfamiliar.  He turned and saw a certain Fred Beaucock--once a promising\nlawyer's clerk and local dandy, who had been called the cleverest\nfellow in Sherton, without whose brains the firm of solicitors\nemploying him would be nowhere.  But later on Beaucock had fallen into\nthe mire.  He was invited out a good deal, sang songs at agricultural\nmeetings and burgesses' dinners; in sum, victualled himself with\nspirits more frequently than was good for the clever brains or body\neither.  He lost his situation, and after an absence spent in trying\nhis powers elsewhere, came back to his native town, where, at the time\nof the foregoing events in Hintock, he gave legal advice for\nastonishingly small fees--mostly carrying on his profession on\npublic-house settles, in whose recesses he might often have been\noverheard making country-people's wills for half a crown; calling with\na learned voice for pen-and-ink and a halfpenny sheet of paper, on\nwhich he drew up the testament while resting it in a little space wiped\nwith his hand on the table amid the liquid circles formed by the cups\nand glasses.  An idea implanted early in life is difficult to uproot,\nand many elderly tradespeople still clung to the notion that Fred\nBeaucock knew a great deal of law.\n\nIt was he who had called Melbury by name.  \"You look very down, Mr.\nMelbury--very, if I may say as much,\" he observed, when the\ntimber-merchant turned.  \"But I know--I know.  A very sad case--very.\nI was bred to the law, as you know, and am professionally no stranger\nto such matters.  Well, Mrs. Fitzpiers has her remedy.\"\n\n\"How--what--a remedy?\" said Melbury.\n\n\"Under the new law, sir.  A new court was established last year, and\nunder the new statute, twenty and twenty-one Vic., cap. eighty-five,\nunmarrying is as easy as marrying.  No more Acts of Parliament\nnecessary; no longer one law for the rich and another for the poor.\nBut come inside--I was just going to have a nibleykin of rum hot--I'll\nexplain it all to you.\"\n\nThe intelligence amazed Melbury, who saw little of newspapers. And\nthough he was a severely correct man in his habits, and had no taste\nfor entering a tavern with Fred Beaucock--nay, would have been quite\nuninfluenced by such a character on any other matter in the world--such\nfascination lay in the idea of delivering his poor girl from bondage,\nthat it deprived him of the critical faculty. He could not resist the\nex-lawyer's clerk, and entered the inn.\n\nHere they sat down to the rum, which Melbury paid for as a matter of\ncourse, Beaucock leaning back in the settle with a legal gravity which\nwould hardly allow him to be conscious of the spirits before him,\nthough they nevertheless disappeared with mysterious quickness.\n\nHow much of the exaggerated information on the then new divorce laws\nwhich Beaucock imparted to his listener was the result of ignorance,\nand how much of dupery, was never ascertained.  But he related such a\nplausible story of the ease with which Grace could become a free woman\nthat her father was irradiated with the project; and though he scarcely\nwetted his lips, Melbury never knew how he came out of the inn, or when\nor where he mounted his gig to pursue his way homeward.  But home he\nfound himself, his brain having all the way seemed to ring sonorously\nas a gong in the intensity of its stir.  Before he had seen Grace, he\nwas accidentally met by Winterborne, who found his face shining as if\nhe had, like the Law-giver, conversed with an angel.\n\nHe relinquished his horse, and took Winterborne by the arm to a heap of\nrendlewood--as barked oak was here called--which lay under a\nprivet-hedge.\n\n\"Giles,\" he said, when they had sat down upon the logs, \"there's a new\nlaw in the land! Grace can be free quite easily.  I only knew it by the\nmerest accident.  I might not have found it out for the next ten years.\nShe can get rid of him--d'ye hear?--get rid of him.  Think of that, my\nfriend Giles!\"\n\nHe related what he had learned of the new legal remedy.  A subdued\ntremulousness about the mouth was all the response that Winterborne\nmade; and Melbury added, \"My boy, you shall have her yet--if you want\nher.\" His feelings had gathered volume as he said this, and the\narticulate sound of the old idea drowned his sight in mist.\n\n\"Are you sure--about this new law?\" asked Winterborne, so disquieted by\na gigantic exultation which loomed alternately with fearful doubt that\nhe evaded the full acceptance of Melbury's last statement.\n\nMelbury said that he had no manner of doubt, for since his talk with\nBeaucock it had come into his mind that he had seen some time ago in\nthe weekly paper an allusion to such a legal change; but, having no\ninterest in those desperate remedies at the moment, he had passed it\nover.  \"But I'm not going to let the matter rest doubtful for a single\nday,\" he continued.  \"I am going to London. Beaucock will go with me,\nand we shall get the best advice as soon as we possibly can.  Beaucock\nis a thorough lawyer--nothing the matter with him but a fiery palate.\nI knew him as the stay and refuge of Sherton in knots of law at one\ntime.\"\n\nWinterborne's replies were of the vaguest.  The new possibility was\nalmost unthinkable by him at the moment.  He was what was called at\nHintock \"a solid-going fellow;\" he maintained his abeyant mood, not\nfrom want of reciprocity, but from a taciturn hesitancy, taught by life\nas he knew it.\n\n\"But,\" continued the timber-merchant, a temporary crease or two of\nanxiety supplementing those already established in his forehead by time\nand care, \"Grace is not at all well.  Nothing constitutional, you know;\nbut she has been in a low, nervous state ever since that night of\nfright.  I don't doubt but that she will be all right soon....I wonder\nhow she is this evening?\" He rose with the words, as if he had too long\nforgotten her personality in the excitement of her previsioned career.\n\nThey had sat till the evening was beginning to dye the garden brown,\nand now went towards Melbury's house, Giles a few steps in the rear of\nhis old friend, who was stimulated by the enthusiasm of the moment to\noutstep the ordinary walking of Winterborne.  He felt shy of entering\nGrace's presence as her reconstituted lover--which was how her\nfather's manner would be sure to present him--before definite\ninformation as to her future state was forthcoming; it seemed too\nnearly like the act of those who rush in where angels fear to tread.\n\nA chill to counterbalance all the glowing promise of the day was prompt\nenough in coming.  No sooner had he followed the timber-merchant in at\nthe door than he heard Grammer inform him that Mrs. Fitzpiers was still\nmore unwell than she had been in the morning. Old Dr. Jones being in\nthe neighborhood they had called him in, and he had instantly directed\nthem to get her to bed.  They were not, however, to consider her\nillness serious--a feverish, nervous attack the result of recent\nevents, was what she was suffering from, and she would doubtless be\nwell in a few days.\n\nWinterborne, therefore, did not remain, and his hope of seeing her that\nevening was disappointed.  Even this aggravation of her morning\ncondition did not greatly depress Melbury.  He knew, he said, that his\ndaughter's constitution was sound enough.  It was only these domestic\ntroubles that were pulling her down.  Once free she would be blooming\nagain.  Melbury diagnosed rightly, as parents usually do.\n\nHe set out for London the next morning, Jones having paid another visit\nand assured him that he might leave home without uneasiness, especially\non an errand of that sort, which would the sooner put an end to her\nsuspense.\n\nThe timber-merchant had been away only a day or two when it was told in\nHintock that Mr. Fitzpiers's hat had been found in the wood.  Later on\nin the afternoon the hat was brought to Melbury, and, by a piece of\nill-fortune, into Grace's presence.  It had doubtless lain in the wood\never since his fall from the horse, but it looked so clean and\nuninjured--the summer weather and leafy shelter having much favored its\npreservation--that Grace could not believe it had remained so long\nconcealed.  A very little of fact was enough to set her fevered fancy\nat work at this juncture; she thought him still in the neighborhood;\nshe feared his sudden appearance; and her nervous malady developed\nconsequences so grave that Dr. Jones began to look serious, and the\nhousehold was alarmed.\n\nIt was the beginning of June, and the cuckoo at this time of the summer\nscarcely ceased his cry for more than two or three hours during the\nnight.  The bird's note, so familiar to her ears from infancy, was now\nabsolute torture to the poor girl.  On the Friday following the\nWednesday of Melbury's departure, and the day after the discovery of\nFitzpiers's hat, the cuckoo began at two o'clock in the morning with a\nsudden cry from one of Melbury's apple-trees, not three yards from the\nwindow of Grace's room.\n\n\"Oh, he is coming!\" she cried, and in her terror sprang clean from the\nbed out upon the floor.\n\nThese starts and frights continued till noon; and when the doctor had\narrived and had seen her, and had talked with Mrs. Melbury, he sat down\nand meditated.  That ever-present terror it was indispensable to remove\nfrom her mind at all hazards; and he thought how this might be done.\n\nWithout saying a word to anybody in the house, or to the disquieted\nWinterborne waiting in the lane below, Dr. Jones went home and wrote to\nMr. Melbury at the London address he had obtained from his wife.  The\ngist of his communication was that Mrs. Fitzpiers should be assured as\nsoon as possible that steps were being taken to sever the bond which\nwas becoming a torture to her; that she would soon be free, and was\neven then virtually so. \"If you can say it AT ONCE it may be the means\nof averting much harm,\" he said.  \"Write to herself; not to me.\"\n\nOn Saturday he drove over to Hintock, and assured her with mysterious\npacifications that in a day or two she might expect to receive some\nassuring news.  So it turned out.  When Sunday morning came there was a\nletter for Grace from her father.  It arrived at seven o'clock, the\nusual time at which the toddling postman passed by Hintock; at eight\nGrace awoke, having slept an hour or two for a wonder, and Mrs. Melbury\nbrought up the letter.\n\n\"Can you open it yourself?\" said she.\n\n\"Oh yes, yes!\" said Grace, with feeble impatience.  She tore the\nenvelope, unfolded the sheet, and read; when a creeping blush tinctured\nher white neck and cheek.\n\nHer father had exercised a bold discretion.  He informed her that she\nneed have no further concern about Fitzpiers's return; that she would\nshortly be a free woman; and therefore, if she should desire to wed her\nold lover--which he trusted was the case, since it was his own deep\nwish--she would be in a position to do so.  In this Melbury had not\nwritten beyond his belief.  But he very much stretched the facts in\nadding that the legal formalities for dissolving her union were\npractically settled.  The truth was that on the arrival of the doctor's\nletter poor Melbury had been much agitated, and could with difficulty\nbe prevented by Beaucock from returning to her bedside.  What was the\nuse of his rushing back to Hintock? Beaucock had asked him.  The only\nthing that could do her any good was a breaking of the bond.  Though he\nhad not as yet had an interview with the eminent solicitor they were\nabout to consult, he was on the point of seeing him; and the case was\nclear enough.  Thus the simple Melbury, urged by his parental alarm at\nher danger by the representations of his companion, and by the doctor's\nletter, had yielded, and sat down to tell her roundly that she was\nvirtually free.\n\n\"And you'd better write also to the gentleman,\" suggested Beaucock,\nwho, scenting notoriety and the germ of a large practice in the case,\nwished to commit Melbury to it irretrievably; to effect which he knew\nthat nothing would be so potent as awakening the passion of Grace for\nWinterborne, so that her father might not have the heart to withdraw\nfrom his attempt to make her love legitimate when he discovered that\nthere were difficulties in the way.\n\nThe nervous, impatient Melbury was much pleased with the idea of\n\"starting them at once,\" as he called it.  To put his long-delayed\nreparative scheme in train had become a passion with him now.  He added\nto the letter addressed to his daughter a passage hinting that she\nought to begin to encourage Winterborne, lest she should lose him\naltogether; and he wrote to Giles that the path was virtually open for\nhim at last.  Life was short, he declared; there were slips betwixt the\ncup and the lip; her interest in him should be reawakened at once, that\nall might be ready when the good time came for uniting them.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\n\nAt these warm words Winterborne was not less dazed than he was moved in\nheart.  The novelty of the avowal rendered what it carried with it\ninapprehensible by him in its entirety.\n\nOnly a few short months ago completely estranged from this\nfamily--beholding Grace going to and fro in the distance, clothed with\nthe alienating radiance of obvious superiority, the wife of the then\npopular and fashionable Fitzpiers, hopelessly outside his social\nboundary down to so recent a time that flowers then folded were hardly\nfaded yet--he was now asked by that jealously guarding father of hers\nto take courage--to get himself ready for the day when he should be\nable to claim her.\n\nThe old times came back to him in dim procession.  How he had been\nsnubbed; how Melbury had despised his Christmas party; how that sweet,\ncoy Grace herself had looked down upon him and his household\narrangements, and poor Creedle's contrivances!\n\nWell, he could not believe it.  Surely the adamantine barrier of\nmarriage with another could not be pierced like this! It did violence\nto custom.  Yet a new law might do anything.  But was it at all within\nthe bounds of probability that a woman who, over and above her own\nattainments, had been accustomed to those of a cultivated professional\nman, could ever be the wife of such as he?\n\nSince the date of his rejection he had almost grown to see the\nreasonableness of that treatment.  He had said to himself again and\nagain that her father was right; that the poor ceorl, Giles\nWinterborne, would never have been able to make such a dainty girl\nhappy.  Yet, now that she had stood in a position farther removed from\nhis own than at first, he was asked to prepare to woo her. He was full\nof doubt.\n\nNevertheless, it was not in him to show backwardness.  To act so\npromptly as Melbury desired him to act seemed, indeed, scarcely wise,\nbecause of the uncertainty of events.  Giles knew nothing of legal\nprocedure, but he did know that for him to step up to Grace as a lover\nbefore the bond which bound her was actually dissolved was simply an\nextravagant dream of her father's overstrained mind. He pitied Melbury\nfor his almost childish enthusiasm, and saw that the aging man must\nhave suffered acutely to be weakened to this unreasoning desire.\n\nWinterborne was far too magnanimous to harbor any cynical conjecture\nthat the timber-merchant, in his intense affection for Grace, was\ncourting him now because that young lady, when disunited, would be left\nin an anomalous position, to escape which a bad husband was better than\nnone.  He felt quite sure that his old friend was simply on tenterhooks\nof anxiety to repair the almost irreparable error of dividing two whom\nNature had striven to join together in earlier days, and that in his\nardor to do this he was oblivious of formalities. The cautious\nsupervision of his past years had overleaped itself at last.  Hence,\nWinterborne perceived that, in this new beginning, the necessary care\nnot to compromise Grace by too early advances must be exercised by\nhimself.\n\nPerhaps Winterborne was not quite so ardent as heretofore.  There is no\nsuch thing as a stationary love: men are either loving more or loving\nless.  But Giles himself recognized no decline in his sense of her\ndearness.  If the flame did indeed burn lower now than when he had\nfetched her from Sherton at her last return from school, the marvel was\nsmall.  He had been laboring ever since his rejection and her marriage\nto reduce his former passion to a docile friendship, out of pure regard\nto its expediency; and their separation may have helped him to a\npartial success.\n\nA week and more passed, and there was no further news of Melbury. But\nthe effect of the intelligence he had already transmitted upon the\nelastic-nerved daughter of the woods had been much what the old surgeon\nJones had surmised.  It had soothed her perturbed spirit better than\nall the opiates in the pharmacopoeia.  She had slept unbrokenly a whole\nnight and a day.  The \"new law\" was to her a mysterious, beneficent,\ngodlike entity, lately descended upon earth, that would make her as she\nonce had been without trouble or annoyance.  Her position fretted her,\nits abstract features rousing an aversion which was even greater than\nher aversion to the personality of him who had caused it.  It was\nmortifying, productive of slights, undignified.  Him she could forget;\nher circumstances she had always with her.\n\nShe saw nothing of Winterborne during the days of her recovery; and\nperhaps on that account her fancy wove about him a more romantic tissue\nthan it could have done if he had stood before her with all the specks\nand flaws inseparable from corporeity.  He rose upon her memory as the\nfruit-god and the wood-god in alternation; sometimes leafy, and smeared\nwith green lichen, as she had seen him among the sappy boughs of the\nplantations; sometimes cider-stained, and with apple-pips in the hair\nof his arms, as she had met him on his return from cider-making in\nWhite Hart Vale, with his vats and presses beside him.  In her secret\nheart she almost approximated to her father's enthusiasm in wishing to\nshow Giles once for all how she still regarded him. The question\nwhether the future would indeed bring them together for life was a\nstanding wonder with her.  She knew that it could not with any\npropriety do so just yet.  But reverently believing in her father's\nsound judgment and knowledge, as good girls are wont to do, she\nremembered what he had written about her giving a hint to Winterborne\nlest there should be risk in delay, and her feelings were not averse to\nsuch a step, so far as it could be done without danger at this early\nstage of the proceedings.\n\nFrom being a frail phantom of her former equable self she returned in\nbounds to a condition of passable philosophy.  She bloomed again in the\nface in the course of a few days, and was well enough to go about as\nusual.  One day Mrs. Melbury proposed that for a change she should be\ndriven in the gig to Sherton market, whither Melbury's man was going on\nother errands.  Grace had no business whatever in Sherton; but it\ncrossed her mind that Winterborne would probably be there, and this\nmade the thought of such a drive interesting.\n\nOn the way she saw nothing of him; but when the horse was walking\nslowly through the obstructions of Sheep Street, she discerned the\nyoung man on the pavement.  She thought of that time when he had been\nstanding under his apple-tree on her return from school, and of the\ntender opportunity then missed through her fastidiousness. Her heart\nrose in her throat.  She abjured all such fastidiousness now.  Nor did\nshe forget the last occasion on which she had beheld him in that town,\nmaking cider in the court-yard of the Earl of Wessex Hotel, while she\nwas figuring as a fine lady in the balcony above.\n\nGrace directed the man to set her down there in the midst, and\nimmediately went up to her lover.  Giles had not before observed her,\nand his eyes now suppressedly looked his pleasure, without the\nembarrassment that had formerly marked him at such meetings.\n\nWhen a few words had been spoken, she said, archly, \"I have nothing to\ndo.  Perhaps you are deeply engaged?\"\n\n\"I?  Not a bit.  My business now at the best of times is small, I am\nsorry to say.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I am going into the Abbey.  Come along with me.\"\n\nThe proposition had suggested itself as a quick escape from publicity,\nfor many eyes were regarding her.  She had hoped that sufficient time\nhad elapsed for the extinction of curiosity; but it was quite\notherwise.  The people looked at her with tender interest as the\ndeserted girl-wife--without obtrusiveness, and without vulgarity; but\nshe was ill prepared for scrutiny in any shape.\n\nThey walked about the Abbey aisles, and presently sat down.  Not a soul\nwas in the building save themselves.  She regarded a stained window,\nwith her head sideways, and tentatively asked him if he remembered the\nlast time they were in that town alone.\n\nHe remembered it perfectly, and remarked, \"You were a proud miss then,\nand as dainty as you were high.  Perhaps you are now?\"\n\nGrace slowly shook her head.  \"Affliction has taken all that out of\nme,\" she answered, impressively.  \"Perhaps I am too far the other way\nnow.\" As there was something lurking in this that she could not\nexplain, she added, so quickly as not to allow him time to think of it,\n\"Has my father written to you at all?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Winterborne.\n\nShe glanced ponderingly up at him.  \"Not about me?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nHis mouth was lined with charactery which told her that he had been\nbidden to take the hint as to the future which she had been bidden to\ngive.  The unexpected discovery sent a scarlet pulsation through Grace\nfor the moment.  However, it was only Giles who stood there, of whom\nshe had no fear; and her self-possession returned.\n\n\"He said I was to sound you with a view to--what you will understand,\nif you care to,\" continued Winterborne, in a low voice.  Having been\nput on this track by herself, he was not disposed to abandon it in a\nhurry.\n\nThey had been children together, and there was between them that\nfamiliarity as to personal affairs which only such acquaintanceship can\ngive.  \"You know, Giles,\" she answered, speaking in a very practical\ntone, \"that that is all very well; but I am in a very anomalous\nposition at present, and I cannot say anything to the point about such\nthings as those.\"\n\n\"No?\" he said, with a stray air as regarded the subject.  He was\nlooking at her with a curious consciousness of discovery.  He had not\nbeen imagining that their renewed intercourse would show her to him\nthus.  For the first time he realized an unexpectedness in her, which,\nafter all, should not have been unexpected.  She before him was not the\ngirl Grace Melbury whom he used to know. Of course, he might easily\nhave prefigured as much; but it had never occurred to him.  She was a\nwoman who had been married; she had moved on; and without having lost\nher girlish modesty, she had lost her girlish shyness.  The inevitable\nchange, though known to him, had not been heeded; and it struck him\ninto a momentary fixity.  The truth was that he had never come into\nclose comradeship with her since her engagement to Fitzpiers, with the\nbrief exception of the evening encounter on Rubdown Hill, when she met\nhim with his cider apparatus; and that interview had been of too\ncursory a kind for insight.\n\nWinterborne had advanced, too.  He could criticise her.  Times had been\nwhen to criticise a single trait in Grace Melbury would have lain as\nfar beyond his powers as to criticise a deity.  This thing was sure: it\nwas a new woman in many ways whom he had come out to see; a creature of\nmore ideas, more dignity, and, above all, more assurance, than the\noriginal Grace had been capable of.  He could not at first decide\nwhether he were pleased or displeased at this. But upon the whole the\nnovelty attracted him.\n\nShe was so sweet and sensitive that she feared his silence betokened\nsomething in his brain of the nature of an enemy to her. \"What are you\nthinking of that makes those lines come in your forehead?\" she asked.\n\"I did not mean to offend you by speaking of the time being premature\nas yet.\"\n\nTouched by the genuine loving-kindness which had lain at the foundation\nof these words, and much moved, Winterborne turned his face aside, as\nhe took her by the hand.  He was grieved that he had criticised her.\n\n\"You are very good, dear Grace,\" he said, in a low voice.  \"You are\nbetter, much better, than you used to be.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\nHe could not very well tell her how, and said, with an evasive smile,\n\"You are prettier;\" which was not what he really had meant. He then\nremained still holding her right hand in his own right, so that they\nfaced in opposite ways; and as he did not let go, she ventured upon a\ntender remonstrance.\n\n\"I think we have gone as far as we ought to go at present--and far\nenough to satisfy my poor father that we are the same as ever. You see,\nGiles, my case is not settled yet, and if--Oh, suppose I NEVER get\nfree!--there should be any hitch or informality!\"\n\nShe drew a catching breath, and turned pale.  The dialogue had been\naffectionate comedy up to this point.  The gloomy atmosphere of the\npast, and the still gloomy horizon of the present, had been for the\ninterval forgotten.  Now the whole environment came back, the due\nbalance of shade among the light was restored.\n\n\"It is sure to be all right, I trust?\" she resumed, in uneasy accents.\n\"What did my father say the solicitor had told him?\"\n\n\"Oh--that all is sure enough.  The case is so clear--nothing could be\nclearer.  But the legal part is not yet quite done and finished, as is\nnatural.\"\n\n\"Oh no--of course not,\" she said, sunk in meek thought.  \"But father\nsaid it was ALMOST--did he not? Do you know anything about the new law\nthat makes these things so easy?\"\n\n\"Nothing--except the general fact that it enables ill-assorted husbands\nand wives to part in a way they could not formerly do without an Act of\nParliament.\"\n\n\"Have you to sign a paper, or swear anything? Is it something like\nthat?\"\n\n\"Yes, I believe so.\"\n\n\"How long has it been introduced?\"\n\n\"About six months or a year, the lawyer said, I think.\"\n\nTo hear these two poor Arcadian innocents talk of imperial law would\nhave made a humane person weep who should have known what a dangerous\nstructure they were building up on their supposed knowledge.  They\nremained in thought, like children in the presence of the\nincomprehensible.\n\n\"Giles,\" she said, at last, \"it makes me quite weary when I think how\nserious my situation is, or has been.  Shall we not go out from here\nnow, as it may seem rather fast of me--our being so long together, I\nmean--if anybody were to see us? I am almost sure,\" she added,\nuncertainly, \"that I ought not to let you hold my hand yet, knowing\nthat the documents--or whatever it may be--have not been signed; so\nthat I--am still as married as ever--or almost. My dear father has\nforgotten himself.  Not that I feel morally bound to any one else,\nafter what has taken place--no woman of spirit could--now, too, that\nseveral months have passed.  But I wish to keep the proprieties as well\nas I can.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes.  Still, your father reminds us that life is short.  I myself\nfeel that it is; that is why I wished to understand you in this that we\nhave begun.  At times, dear Grace, since receiving your father's\nletter, I am as uneasy and fearful as a child at what he said.  If one\nof us were to die before the formal signing and sealing that is to\nrelease you have been done--if we should drop out of the world and\nnever have made the most of this little, short, but real opportunity, I\nshould think to myself as I sunk down dying, 'Would to my God that I\nhad spoken out my whole heart--given her one poor little kiss when I\nhad the chance to give it! But I never did, although she had promised\nto be mine some day; and now I never can.' That's what I should think.\"\n\nShe had begun by watching the words from his lips with a mournful\nregard, as though their passage were visible; but as he went on she\ndropped her glance.  \"Yes,\" she said, \"I have thought that, too.  And,\nbecause I have thought it, I by no means meant, in speaking of the\nproprieties, to be reserved and cold to you who loved me so long ago,\nor to hurt your heart as I used to do at that thoughtless time.  Oh,\nnot at all, indeed! But--ought I to allow you?--oh, it is too\nquick--surely!\"  Her eyes filled with tears of bewildered, alarmed\nemotion.\n\nWinterborne was too straightforward to influence her further against\nher better judgment.  \"Yes--I suppose it is,\" he said, repentantly.\n\"I'll wait till all is settled.  What did your father say in that last\nletter?\"\n\nHe meant about his progress with the petition; but she, mistaking him,\nfrankly spoke of the personal part.  \"He said--what I have implied.\nShould I tell more plainly?\"\n\n\"Oh no--don't, if it is a secret.\"\n\n\"Not at all.  I will tell every word, straight out, Giles, if you wish.\nHe said I was to encourage you.  There.  But I cannot obey him further\nto-day.  Come, let us go now.\" She gently slid her hand from his, and\nwent in front of him out of the Abbey.\n\n\"I was thinking of getting some dinner,\" said Winterborne, changing to\nthe prosaic, as they walked.  \"And you, too, must require something.\nDo let me take you to a place I know.\"\n\nGrace was almost without a friend in the world outside her father's\nhouse; her life with Fitzpiers had brought her no society; had\nsometimes, indeed, brought her deeper solitude and inconsideration than\nany she had ever known before.  Hence it was a treat to her to find\nherself again the object of thoughtful care.  But she questioned if to\ngo publicly to dine with Giles Winterborne were not a proposal, due\nrather to his unsophistication than to his discretion.  She said gently\nthat she would much prefer his ordering her lunch at some place and\nthen coming to tell her it was ready, while she remained in the Abbey\nporch.  Giles saw her secret reasoning, thought how hopelessly blind to\npropriety he was beside her, and went to do as she wished.\n\nHe was not absent more than ten minutes, and found Grace where he had\nleft her.  \"It will be quite ready by the time you get there,\" he said,\nand told her the name of the inn at which the meal had been ordered,\nwhich was one that she had never heard of.\n\n\"I'll find it by inquiry,\" said Grace, setting out.\n\n\"And shall I see you again?\"\n\n\"Oh yes--come to me there.  It will not be like going together.  I\nshall want you to find my father's man and the gig for me.\"\n\nHe waited on some ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, till he thought\nher lunch ended, and that he might fairly take advantage of her\ninvitation to start her on her way home.  He went straight to The Three\nTuns--a little tavern in a side street, scrupulously clean, but humble\nand inexpensive.  On his way he had an occasional misgiving as to\nwhether the place had been elegant enough for her; and as soon as he\nentered it, and saw her ensconced there, he perceived that he had\nblundered.\n\nGrace was seated in the only dining-room that the simple old hostelry\ncould boast of, which was also a general parlor on market-days; a long,\nlow apartment, with a sanded floor herring-boned with a broom; a wide,\nred-curtained window to the street, and another to the garden.  Grace\nhad retreated to the end of the room looking out upon the latter, the\nfront part being full of a mixed company which had dropped in since he\nwas there.\n\nShe was in a mood of the greatest depression.  On arriving, and seeing\nwhat the tavern was like, she had been taken by surprise; but having\ngone too far to retreat, she had heroically entered and sat down on the\nwell-scrubbed settle, opposite the narrow table with its knives and\nsteel forks, tin pepper-boxes, blue salt-cellars, and posters\nadvertising the sale of bullocks against the wall.  The last time that\nshe had taken any meal in a public place it had been with Fitzpiers at\nthe grand new Earl of Wessex Hotel in that town, after a two months'\nroaming and sojourning at the gigantic hotels of the Continent.  How\ncould she have expected any other kind of accommodation in present\ncircumstances than such as Giles had provided? And yet how unprepared\nshe was for this change! The tastes that she had acquired from\nFitzpiers had been imbibed so subtly that she hardly knew she possessed\nthem till confronted by this contrast.  The elegant Fitzpiers, in fact,\nat that very moment owed a long bill at the above-mentioned hotel for\nthe luxurious style in which he used to put her up there whenever they\ndrove to Sherton.  But such is social sentiment, that she had been\nquite comfortable under those debt-impending conditions, while she felt\nhumiliated by her present situation, which Winterborne had paid for\nhonestly on the nail.\n\nHe had noticed in a moment that she shrunk from her position, and all\nhis pleasure was gone.  It was the same susceptibility over again which\nhad spoiled his Christmas party long ago.\n\nBut he did not know that this recrudescence was only the casual result\nof Grace's apprenticeship to what she was determined to learn in spite\nof it--a consequence of one of those sudden surprises which confront\neverybody bent upon turning over a new leaf.  She had finished her\nlunch, which he saw had been a very mincing performance; and he brought\nher out of the house as soon as he could.\n\n\"Now,\" he said, with great sad eyes, \"you have not finished at all\nwell, I know.  Come round to the Earl of Wessex.  I'll order a tea\nthere.  I did not remember that what was good enough for me was not\ngood enough for you.\"\n\nHer face faded into an aspect of deep distress when she saw what had\nhappened.  \"Oh no, Giles,\" she said, with extreme pathos; \"certainly\nnot.  Why do you--say that when you know better?  You EVER will\nmisunderstand me.\"\n\n\"Indeed, that's not so, Mrs. Fitzpiers.  Can you deny that you felt out\nof place at The Three Tuns?\"\n\n\"I don't know.  Well, since you make me speak, I do not deny it.\"\n\n\"And yet I have felt at home there these twenty years.  Your husband\nused always to take you to the Earl of Wessex, did he not?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she reluctantly admitted.  How could she explain in the street\nof a market-town that it was her superficial and transitory taste which\nhad been offended, and not her nature or her affection? Fortunately, or\nunfortunately, at that moment they saw Melbury's man driving vacantly\nalong the street in search of her, the hour having passed at which he\nhad been told to take her up. Winterborne hailed him, and she was\npowerless then to prolong the discourse.  She entered the vehicle\nsadly, and the horse trotted away.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\n\nAll night did Winterborne think over that unsatisfactory ending of a\npleasant time, forgetting the pleasant time itself.  He feared anew\nthat they could never be happy together, even should she be free to\nchoose him.  She was accomplished; he was unrefined.  It was the\noriginal difficulty, which he was too sensitive to recklessly ignore,\nas some men would have done in his place.\n\nHe was one of those silent, unobtrusive beings who want little from\nothers in the way of favor or condescension, and perhaps on that very\naccount scrutinize those others' behavior too closely. He was not\nversatile, but one in whom a hope or belief which had once had its\nrise, meridian, and decline seldom again exactly recurred, as in the\nbreasts of more sanguine mortals.  He had once worshipped her, laid out\nhis life to suit her, wooed her, and lost her.  Though it was with\nalmost the same zest, it was with not quite the same hope, that he had\nbegun to tread the old tracks again, and allowed himself to be so\ncharmed with her that day.\n\nMove another step towards her he would not.  He would even repulse\nher--as a tribute to conscience.  It would be sheer sin to let her\nprepare a pitfall for her happiness not much smaller than the first by\ninveigling her into a union with such as he.  Her poor father was now\nblind to these subtleties, which he had formerly beheld as in noontide\nlight.  It was his own duty to declare them--for her dear sake.\n\n\nGrace, too, had a very uncomfortable night, and her solicitous\nembarrassment was not lessened the next morning when another letter\nfrom her father was put into her hands.  Its tenor was an intenser\nstrain of the one that had preceded it.  After stating how extremely\nglad he was to hear that she was better, and able to get out-of-doors,\nhe went on:\n\n\"This is a wearisome business, the solicitor we have come to see being\nout of town.  I do not know when I shall get home.  My great anxiety in\nthis delay is still lest you should lose Giles Winterborne.  I cannot\nrest at night for thinking that while our business is hanging fire he\nmay become estranged, or go away from the neighborhood.  I have set my\nheart upon seeing him your husband, if you ever have another.  Do,\nthen, Grace, give him some temporary encouragement, even though it is\nover-early.  For when I consider the past I do think God will forgive\nme and you for being a little forward.  I have another reason for this,\nmy dear.  I feel myself going rapidly downhill, and late affairs have\nstill further helped me that way.  And until this thing is done I\ncannot rest in peace.\"\n\nHe added a postscript:\n\n\"I have just heard that the solicitor is to be seen to-morrow.\nPossibly, therefore, I shall return in the evening after you get this.\"\n\n\nThe paternal longing ran on all fours with her own desire; and yet in\nforwarding it yesterday she had been on the brink of giving offence.\nWhile craving to be a country girl again just as her father requested;\nto put off the old Eve, the fastidious miss--or rather\nmadam--completely, her first attempt had been beaten by the unexpected\nvitality of that fastidiousness.  Her father on returning and seeing\nthe trifling coolness of Giles would be sure to say that the same\nperversity which had led her to make difficulties about marrying\nFitzpiers was now prompting her to blow hot and cold with poor\nWinterborne.\n\nIf the latter had been the most subtle hand at touching the stops of\nher delicate soul instead of one who had just bound himself to let her\ndrift away from him again (if she would) on the wind of her estranging\neducation, he could not have acted more seductively than he did that\nday.  He chanced to be superintending some temporary work in a field\nopposite her windows.  She could not discover what he was doing, but\nshe read his mood keenly and truly: she could see in his coming and\ngoing an air of determined abandonment of the whole landscape that lay\nin her direction.\n\nOh, how she longed to make it up with him! Her father coming in the\nevening--which meant, she supposed, that all formalities would be in\ntrain, her marriage virtually annulled, and she be free to be won\nagain--how could she look him in the face if he should see them\nestranged thus?\n\nIt was a fair green evening in June.  She was seated in the garden, in\nthe rustic chair which stood under the laurel-bushes--made of peeled\noak-branches that came to Melbury's premises as refuse after\nbarking-time.  The mass of full-juiced leafage on the heights around\nher was just swayed into faint gestures by a nearly spent wind which,\neven in its enfeebled state, did not reach her shelter.  All day she\nhad expected Giles to call--to inquire how she had got home, or\nsomething or other; but he had not come.  And he still tantalized her\nby going athwart and across that orchard opposite.  She could see him\nas she sat.\n\nA slight diversion was presently created by Creedle bringing him a\nletter.  She knew from this that Creedle had just come from Sherton,\nand had called as usual at the post-office for anything that had\narrived by the afternoon post, of which there was no delivery at\nHintock.  She pondered on what the letter might contain--particularly\nwhether it were a second refresher for Winterborne from her father,\nlike her own of the morning.\n\nBut it appeared to have no bearing upon herself whatever.  Giles read\nits contents; and almost immediately turned away to a gap in the hedge\nof the orchard--if that could be called a hedge which, owing to the\ndrippings of the trees, was little more than a bank with a bush upon it\nhere and there.  He entered the plantation, and was no doubt going that\nway homeward to the mysterious hut he occupied on the other side of the\nwoodland.\n\nThe sad sands were running swiftly through Time's glass; she had often\nfelt it in these latter days; and, like Giles, she felt it doubly now\nafter the solemn and pathetic reminder in her father's communication.\nHer freshness would pass, the long-suffering devotion of Giles might\nsuddenly end--might end that very hour. Men were so strange.  The\nthought took away from her all her former reticence, and made her\naction bold.  She started from her seat.  If the little breach,\nquarrel, or whatever it might be called, of yesterday, was to be healed\nup it must be done by her on the instant.  She crossed into the\norchard, and clambered through the gap after Giles, just as he was\ndiminishing to a faun-like figure under the green canopy and over the\nbrown floor.\n\nGrace had been wrong--very far wrong--in assuming that the letter had\nno reference to herself because Giles had turned away into the wood\nafter its perusal.  It was, sad to say, because the missive had so much\nreference to herself that he had thus turned away.  He feared that his\ngrieved discomfiture might be observed.  The letter was from Beaucock,\nwritten a few hours later than Melbury's to his daughter.  It announced\nfailure.\n\nGiles had once done that thriftless man a good turn, and now was the\nmoment when Beaucock had chosen to remember it in his own way. During\nhis absence in town with Melbury, the lawyer's clerk had naturally\nheard a great deal of the timber-merchant's family scheme of justice to\nGiles, and his communication was to inform Winterborne at the earliest\npossible moment that their attempt had failed, in order that the young\nman should not place himself in a false position towards Grace in the\nbelief of its coming success. The news was, in sum, that Fitzpiers's\nconduct had not been sufficiently cruel to Grace to enable her to snap\nthe bond.  She was apparently doomed to be his wife till the end of the\nchapter.\n\nWinterborne quite forgot his superficial differences with the poor girl\nunder the warm rush of deep and distracting love for her which the\nalmost tragical information engendered.\n\nTo renounce her forever--that was then the end of it for him, after\nall.  There was no longer any question about suitability, or room for\ntiffs on petty tastes.  The curtain had fallen again between them.  She\ncould not be his.  The cruelty of their late revived hope was now\nterrible.  How could they all have been so simple as to suppose this\nthing could be done?\n\nIt was at this moment that, hearing some one coming behind him, he\nturned and saw her hastening on between the thickets.  He perceived in\nan instant that she did not know the blighting news.\n\n\"Giles, why didn't you come across to me?\" she asked, with arch\nreproach.  \"Didn't you see me sitting there ever so long?\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" he said, in unprepared, extemporized tones, for her\nunexpected presence caught him without the slightest plan of behavior\nin the conjuncture.  His manner made her think that she had been too\nchiding in her speech; and a mild scarlet wave passed over her as she\nresolved to soften it.\n\n\"I have had another letter from my father,\" she hastened to continue.\n\"He thinks he may come home this evening.  And--in view of his\nhopes--it will grieve him if there is any little difference between us,\nGiles.\"\n\n\"There is none,\" he said, sadly regarding her from the face downward as\nhe pondered how to lay the cruel truth bare.\n\n\"Still--I fear you have not quite forgiven me about my being\nuncomfortable at the inn.\"\n\n\"I have, Grace, I'm sure.\"\n\n\"But you speak in quite an unhappy way,\" she returned, coming up close\nto him with the most winning of the many pretty airs that appertained\nto her.  \"Don't you think you will ever be happy, Giles?\"\n\nHe did not reply for some instants.  \"When the sun shines on the north\nfront of Sherton Abbey--that's when my happiness will come to me!\" said\nhe, staring as it were into the earth.\n\n\"But--then that means that there is something more than my offending\nyou in not liking The Three Tuns.  If it is because I--did not like to\nlet you kiss me in the Abbey--well, you know, Giles, that it was not on\naccount of my cold feelings, but because I did certainly, just then,\nthink it was rather premature, in spite of my poor father.  That was\nthe true reason--the sole one. But I do not want to be hard--God knows\nI do not,\" she said, her voice fluctuating.  \"And perhaps--as I am on\nthe verge of freedom--I am not right, after all, in thinking there is\nany harm in your kissing me.\"\n\n\"Oh God!\" said Winterborne within himself.  His head was turned askance\nas he still resolutely regarded the ground.  For the last several\nminutes he had seen this great temptation approaching him in regular\nsiege; and now it had come.  The wrong, the social sin, of now taking\nadvantage of the offer of her lips had a magnitude, in the eyes of one\nwhose life had been so primitive, so ruled by purest household laws, as\nGiles's, which can hardly be explained.\n\n\"Did you say anything?\" she asked, timidly.\n\n\"Oh no--only that--\"\n\n\"You mean that it must BE settled, since my father is coming home?\" she\nsaid, gladly.\n\nWinterborne, though fighting valiantly against himself all this\nwhile--though he would have protected Grace's good repute as the apple\nof his eye--was a man; and, as Desdemona said, men are not gods.  In\nface of the agonizing seductiveness shown by her, in her unenlightened\nschool-girl simplicity about the laws and ordinances, he betrayed a\nman's weakness.  Since it was so--since it had come to this, that\nGrace, deeming herself free to do it, was virtually asking him to\ndemonstrate that he loved her--since he could demonstrate it only too\ntruly--since life was short and love was strong--he gave way to the\ntemptation, notwithstanding that he perfectly well knew her to be\nwedded irrevocably to Fitzpiers.  Indeed, he cared for nothing past or\nfuture, simply accepting the present and what it brought, desiring once\nin his life to clasp in his arms her he had watched over and loved so\nlong.\n\nShe started back suddenly from his embrace, influenced by a sort of\ninspiration.  \"Oh, I suppose,\" she stammered, \"that I am really\nfree?--that this is right? Is there REALLY a new law? Father cannot\nhave been too sanguine in saying--\"\n\nHe did not answer, and a moment afterwards Grace burst into tears in\nspite of herself.  \"Oh, why does not my father come home and explain,\"\nshe sobbed, \"and let me know clearly what I am? It is too trying, this,\nto ask me to--and then to leave me so long in so vague a state that I\ndo not know what to do, and perhaps do wrong!\"\n\nWinterborne felt like a very Cain, over and above his previous sorrow.\nHow he had sinned against her in not telling her what he knew.  He\nturned aside; the feeling of his cruelty mounted higher and higher.\nHow could he have dreamed of kissing her? He could hardly refrain from\ntears.  Surely nothing more pitiable had ever been known than the\ncondition of this poor young thing, now as heretofore the victim of her\nfather's well-meant but blundering policy.\n\nEven in the hour of Melbury's greatest assurance Winterborne had\nharbored a suspicion that no law, new or old, could undo Grace's\nmarriage without her appearance in public; though he was not\nsufficiently sure of what might have been enacted to destroy by his own\nwords her pleasing idea that a mere dash of the pen, on her father's\ntestimony, was going to be sufficient.  But he had never suspected the\nsad fact that the position was irremediable.\n\nPoor Grace, perhaps feeling that she had indulged in too much fluster\nfor a mere kiss, calmed herself at finding how grave he was.  \"I am\nglad we are friends again anyhow,\" she said, smiling through her tears.\n\"Giles, if you had only shown half the boldness before I married that\nyou show now, you would have carried me off for your own first instead\nof second.  If we do marry, I hope you will never think badly of me for\nencouraging you a little, but my father is SO impatient, you know, as\nhis years and infirmities increase, that he will wish to see us a\nlittle advanced when he comes.  That is my only excuse.\"\n\nTo Winterborne all this was sadder than it was sweet.  How could she so\ntrust her father's conjectures? He did not know how to tell her the\ntruth and shame himself.  And yet he felt that it must be done.  \"We\nmay have been wrong,\" he began, almost fearfully, \"in supposing that it\ncan all be carried out while we stay here at Hintock.  I am not sure\nbut that people may have to appear in a public court even under the new\nAct; and if there should be any difficulty, and we cannot marry after\nall--\"\n\nHer cheeks became slowly bloodless.  \"Oh, Giles,\" she said, grasping\nhis arm, \"you have heard something! What--cannot my father conclude it\nthere and now? Surely he has done it? Oh, Giles, Giles, don't deceive\nme.  What terrible position am I in?\"\n\nHe could not tell her, try as he would.  The sense of her implicit\ntrust in his honor absolutely disabled him.  \"I cannot inform you,\" he\nmurmured, his voice as husky as that of the leaves underfoot.  \"Your\nfather will soon be here.  Then we shall know. I will take you home.\"\n\nInexpressibly dear as she was to him, he offered her his arm with the\nmost reserved air, as he added, correctingly, \"I will take you, at any\nrate, into the drive.\"\n\nThus they walked on together.  Grace vibrating between happiness and\nmisgiving.  It was only a few minutes' walk to where the drive ran, and\nthey had hardly descended into it when they heard a voice behind them\ncry, \"Take out that arm!\"\n\nFor a moment they did not heed, and the voice repeated, more loudly and\nhoarsely,\n\n\"Take out that arm!\"\n\nIt was Melbury's.  He had returned sooner than they expected, and now\ncame up to them.  Grace's hand had been withdrawn like lightning on her\nhearing the second command.  \"I don't blame you--I don't blame you,\"\nhe said, in the weary cadence of one broken down with scourgings.  \"But\nyou two must walk together no more--I have been surprised--I have been\ncruelly deceived--Giles, don't say anything to me; but go away!\"\n\nHe was evidently not aware that Winterborne had known the truth before\nhe brought it; and Giles would not stay to discuss it with him then.\nWhen the young man had gone Melbury took his daughter in-doors to the\nroom he used as his office.  There he sat down, and bent over the slope\nof the bureau, her bewildered gaze fixed upon him.\n\nWhen Melbury had recovered a little he said, \"You are now, as ever,\nFitzpiers's wife.  I was deluded.  He has not done you ENOUGH harm.\nYou are still subject to his beck and call.\"\n\n\"Then let it be, and never mind, father,\" she said, with dignified\nsorrow.  \"I can bear it.  It is your trouble that grieves me most.\" She\nstooped over him, and put her arm round his neck, which distressed\nMelbury still more.  \"I don't mind at all what comes to me,\" Grace\ncontinued; \"whose wife I am, or whose I am not.  I do love Giles; I\ncannot help that; and I have gone further with him than I should have\ndone if I had known exactly how things were. But I do not reproach you.\"\n\n\"Then Giles did not tell you?\" said Melbury.\n\n\"No,\" said she.  \"He could not have known it.  His behavior to me\nproved that he did not know.\"\n\nHer father said nothing more, and Grace went away to the solitude of\nher chamber.\n\nHer heavy disquietude had many shapes; and for a time she put aside the\ndominant fact to think of her too free conduct towards Giles.  His\nlove-making had been brief as it was sweet; but would he on reflection\ncontemn her for forwardness? How could she have been so simple as to\nsuppose she was in a position to behave as she had done! Thus she\nmentally blamed her ignorance; and yet in the centre of her heart she\nblessed it a little for what it had momentarily brought her.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL.\n\nLife among the people involved in these events seemed to be suppressed\nand hide-bound for a while.  Grace seldom showed herself outside the\nhouse, never outside the garden; for she feared she might encounter\nGiles Winterborne; and that she could not bear.\n\nThis pensive intramural existence of the self-constituted nun appeared\nlikely to continue for an indefinite time.  She had learned that there\nwas one possibility in which her formerly imagined position might\nbecome real, and only one; that her husband's absence should continue\nlong enough to amount to positive desertion.  But she never allowed her\nmind to dwell much upon the thought; still less did she deliberately\nhope for such a result.  Her regard for Winterborne had been rarefied\nby the shock which followed its avowal into an ethereal emotion that\nhad little to do with living and doing.\n\nAs for Giles, he was lying--or rather sitting--ill at his hut.  A\nfeverish indisposition which had been hanging about him for some time,\nthe result of a chill caught the previous winter, seemed to acquire\nvirulence with the prostration of his hopes.  But not a soul knew of\nhis languor, and he did not think the case serious enough to send for a\nmedical man.  After a few days he was better again, and crept about his\nhome in a great coat, attending to his simple wants as usual with his\nown hands.  So matters stood when the limpid inertion of Grace's\npool-like existence was disturbed as by a geyser.  She received a\nletter from Fitzpiers.\n\nSuch a terrible letter it was in its import, though couched in the\ngentlest language.  In his absence Grace had grown to regard him with\ntoleration, and her relation to him with equanimity, till she had\nalmost forgotten how trying his presence would be.  He wrote briefly\nand unaffectedly; he made no excuses, but informed her that he was\nliving quite alone, and had been led to think that they ought to be\ntogether, if she would make up her mind to forgive him.  He therefore\npurported to cross the Channel to Budmouth by the steamer on a day he\nnamed, which she found to be three days after the time of her present\nreading.\n\nHe said that he could not come to Hintock for obvious reasons, which\nher father would understand even better than herself.  As the only\nalternative she was to be on the quay to meet the steamer when it\narrived from the opposite coast, probably about half an hour before\nmidnight, bringing with her any luggage she might require; join him\nthere, and pass with him into the twin vessel, which left immediately\nthe other entered the harbor; returning thus with him to his\ncontinental dwelling-place, which he did not name.  He had no intention\nof showing himself on land at all.\n\nThe troubled Grace took the letter to her father, who now continued for\nlong hours by the fireless summer chimney-corner, as if he thought it\nwere winter, the pitcher of cider standing beside him, mostly untasted,\nand coated with a film of dust.  After reading it he looked up.\n\n\"You sha'n't go,\" said he.\n\n\"I had felt I would not,\" she answered.  \"But I did not know what you\nwould say.\"\n\n\"If he comes and lives in England, not too near here and in a\nrespectable way, and wants you to come to him, I am not sure that I'll\noppose him in wishing it,\" muttered Melbury.  \"I'd stint myself to keep\nyou both in a genteel and seemly style.  But go abroad you never shall\nwith my consent.\"\n\nThere the question rested that day.  Grace was unable to reply to her\nhusband in the absence of an address, and the morrow came, and the next\nday, and the evening on which he had requested her to meet him.\nThroughout the whole of it she remained within the four walls of her\nroom.\n\nThe sense of her harassment, carking doubt of what might be impending,\nhung like a cowl of blackness over the Melbury household.  They spoke\nalmost in whispers, and wondered what Fitzpiers would do next.  It was\nthe hope of every one that, finding she did not arrive, he would return\nagain to France; and as for Grace, she was willing to write to him on\nthe most kindly terms if he would only keep away.\n\nThe night passed, Grace lying tense and wide awake, and her relatives,\nin great part, likewise.  When they met the next morning they were pale\nand anxious, though neither speaking of the subject which occupied all\ntheir thoughts.  The day passed as quietly as the previous ones, and\nshe began to think that in the rank caprice of his moods he had\nabandoned the idea of getting her to join him as quickly as it was\nformed.  All on a sudden, some person who had just come from Sherton\nentered the house with the news that Mr. Fitzpiers was on his way home\nto Hintock.  He had been seen hiring a carriage at the Earl of Wessex\nHotel.\n\nHer father and Grace were both present when the intelligence was\nannounced.\n\n\"Now,\" said Melbury, \"we must make the best of what has been a very bad\nmatter.  The man is repenting; the partner of his shame, I hear, is\ngone away from him to Switzerland, so that chapter of his life is\nprobably over.  If he chooses to make a home for ye I think you should\nnot say him nay, Grace.  Certainly he cannot very well live at Hintock\nwithout a blow to his pride; but if he can bear that, and likes Hintock\nbest, why, there's the empty wing of the house as it was before.\"\n\n\"Oh, father!\" said Grace, turning white with dismay.\n\n\"Why not?\" said he, a little of his former doggedness returning. He\nwas, in truth, disposed to somewhat more leniency towards her husband\njust now than he had shown formerly, from a conviction that he had\ntreated him over-roughly in his anger.  \"Surely it is the most\nrespectable thing to do?\" he continued.  \"I don't like this state that\nyou are in--neither married nor single.  It hurts me, and it hurts you,\nand it will always be remembered against us in Hintock.  There has\nnever been any scandal like it in the family before.\"\n\n\"He will be here in less than an hour,\" murmured Grace.  The twilight\nof the room prevented her father seeing the despondent misery of her\nface.  The one intolerable condition, the condition she had deprecated\nabove all others, was that of Fitzpiers's reinstatement there.  \"Oh, I\nwon't, I won't see him,\" she said, sinking down.  She was almost\nhysterical.\n\n\"Try if you cannot,\" he returned, moodily.\n\n\"Oh yes, I will, I will,\" she went on, inconsequently.  \"I'll try;\" and\njumping up suddenly, she left the room.\n\nIn the darkness of the apartment to which she flew nothing could have\nbeen seen during the next half-hour; but from a corner a quick\nbreathing was audible from this impressible creature, who combined\nmodern nerves with primitive emotions, and was doomed by such\ncoexistence to be numbered among the distressed, and to take her\nscourgings to their exquisite extremity.\n\nThe window was open.  On this quiet, late summer evening, whatever\nsound arose in so secluded a district--the chirp of a bird, a call from\na voice, the turning of a wheel--extended over bush and tree to\nunwonted distances.  Very few sounds did arise.  But as Grace invisibly\nbreathed in the brown glooms of the chamber, the small remote noise of\nlight wheels came in to her, accompanied by the trot of a horse on the\nturnpike-road.  There seemed to be a sudden hitch or pause in the\nprogress of the vehicle, which was what first drew her attention to it.\nShe knew the point whence the sound proceeded--the hill-top over which\ntravellers passed on their way hitherward from Sherton Abbas--the place\nat which she had emerged from the wood with Mrs. Charmond.  Grace slid\nalong the floor, and bent her head over the window-sill, listening with\nopen lips.  The carriage had stopped, and she heard a man use\nexclamatory words.  Then another said, \"What the devil is the matter\nwith the horse?\" She recognized the voice as her husband's.\n\nThe accident, such as it had been, was soon remedied, and the carriage\ncould be heard descending the hill on the Hintock side, soon to turn\ninto the lane leading out of the highway, and then into the \"drong\"\nwhich led out of the lane to the house where she was.\n\nA spasm passed through Grace.  The Daphnean instinct, exceptionally\nstrong in her as a girl, had been revived by her widowed seclusion; and\nit was not lessened by her affronted sentiments towards the comer, and\nher regard for another man.  She opened some little ivory tablets that\nlay on the dressing-table, scribbled in pencil on one of them, \"I am\ngone to visit one of my school-friends,\" gathered a few toilet\nnecessaries into a hand-bag, and not three minutes after that voice\nhad been heard, her slim form, hastily wrapped up from observation,\nmight have been seen passing out of the back door of Melbury's house.\nThence she skimmed up the garden-path, through the gap in the hedge,\nand into the mossy cart-track under the trees which led into the depth\nof the woods.\n\nThe leaves overhead were now in their latter green--so opaque, that it\nwas darker at some of the densest spots than in winter-time, scarce a\ncrevice existing by which a ray could get down to the ground.  But in\nopen places she could see well enough.  Summer was ending: in the\ndaytime singing insects hung in every sunbeam; vegetation was heavy\nnightly with globes of dew; and after showers creeping damps and\ntwilight chills came up from the hollows.  The plantations were always\nweird at this hour of eve--more spectral far than in the leafless\nseason, when there were fewer masses and more minute lineality.  The\nsmooth surfaces of glossy plants came out like weak, lidless eyes;\nthere were strange faces and figures from expiring lights that had\nsomehow wandered into the canopied obscurity; while now and then low\npeeps of the sky between the trunks were like sheeted shapes, and on\nthe tips of boughs sat faint cloven tongues.\n\nBut Grace's fear just now was not imaginative or spiritual, and she\nheeded these impressions but little.  She went on as silently as she\ncould, avoiding the hollows wherein leaves had accumulated, and\nstepping upon soundless moss and grass-tufts.  She paused breathlessly\nonce or twice, and fancied that she could hear, above the beat of her\nstrumming pulse, the vehicle containing Fitzpiers turning in at the\ngate of her father's premises.  She hastened on again.\n\nThe Hintock woods owned by Mrs. Charmond were presently left behind,\nand those into which she next plunged were divided from the latter by a\nbank, from whose top the hedge had long ago perished--starved for want\nof sun.  It was with some caution that Grace now walked, though she was\nquite free from any of the commonplace timidities of her ordinary\npilgrimages to such spots. She feared no lurking harms, but that her\neffort would be all in vain, and her return to the house rendered\nimperative.\n\nShe had walked between three and four miles when that prescriptive\ncomfort and relief to wanderers in woods--a distant light--broke at\nlast upon her searching eyes.  It was so very small as to be almost\nsinister to a stranger, but to her it was what she sought. She pushed\nforward, and the dim outline of a dwelling was disclosed.\n\nThe house was a square cot of one story only, sloping up on all sides\nto a chimney in the midst.  It had formerly been the home of a\ncharcoal-burner, in times when that fuel was still used in the county\nhouses.  Its only appurtenance was a paled enclosure, there being no\ngarden, the shade of the trees preventing the growth of vegetables.\nShe advanced to the window whence the rays of light proceeded, and the\nshutters being as yet unclosed, she could survey the whole interior\nthrough the panes.\n\nThe room within was kitchen, parlor, and scullery all in one; the\nnatural sandstone floor was worn into hills and dales by long treading,\nso that none of the furniture stood level, and the table slanted like a\ndesk.  A fire burned on the hearth, in front of which revolved the\nskinned carcass of a rabbit, suspended by a string from a nail.\nLeaning with one arm on the mantle-shelf stood Winterborne, his eyes on\nthe roasting animal, his face so rapt that speculation could build\nnothing on it concerning his thoughts, more than that they were not\nwith the scene before him. She thought his features had changed a\nlittle since she saw them last.  The fire-light did not enable her to\nperceive that they were positively haggard.\n\nGrace's throat emitted a gasp of relief at finding the result so nearly\nas she had hoped.  She went to the door and tapped lightly.\n\nHe seemed to be accustomed to the noises of woodpeckers, squirrels, and\nsuch small creatures, for he took no notice of her tiny signal, and she\nknocked again.  This time he came and opened the door.  When the light\nof the room fell upon her face he started, and, hardly knowing what he\ndid, crossed the threshold to her, placing his hands upon her two arms,\nwhile surprise, joy, alarm, sadness, chased through him by turns.  With\nGrace it was the same: even in this stress there was the fond fact that\nthey had met again.  Thus they stood,\n\n    \"Long tears upon their faces, waxen white\n         With extreme sad delight.\"\n\n\nHe broke the silence by saying in a whisper, \"Come in.\"\n\n\"No, no, Giles!\" she answered, hurriedly, stepping yet farther back\nfrom the door.  \"I am passing by--and I have called on you--I won't\nenter.  Will you help me?  I am afraid.  I want to get by a roundabout\nway to Sherton, and so to Exbury.  I have a school-fellow there--but I\ncannot get to Sherton alone.  Oh, if you will only accompany me a\nlittle way! Don't condemn me, Giles, and be offended! I was obliged to\ncome to you because--I have no other help here.  Three months ago you\nwere my lover; now you are only my friend.  The law has stepped in, and\nforbidden what we thought of.  It must not be.  But we can act\nhonestly, and yet you can be my friend for one little hour?  I have no\nother--\"\n\nShe could get no further.  Covering her eyes with one hand, by an\neffort of repression she wept a silent trickle, without a sigh or sob.\nWinterborne took her other hand.  \"What has happened?\" he said.\n\n\"He has come.\"\n\nThere was a stillness as of death, till Winterborne asked, \"You mean\nthis, Grace--that I am to help you to get away?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said she.  \"Appearance is no matter, when the reality is right.\nI have said to myself I can trust you.\"\n\nGiles knew from this that she did not suspect his treachery--if it\ncould be called such--earlier in the summer, when they met for the last\ntime as lovers; and in the intensity of his contrition for that tender\nwrong, he determined to deserve her faith now at least, and so wipe out\nthat reproach from his conscience.  \"I'll come at once,\" he said.\n\"I'll light a lantern.\"\n\nHe unhooked a dark-lantern from a nail under the eaves and she did not\nnotice how his hand shook with the slight strain, or dream that in\nmaking this offer he was taxing a convalescence which could ill afford\nsuch self-sacrifice.  The lantern was lit, and they started.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI.\n\nThe first hundred yards of their course lay under motionless trees,\nwhose upper foliage began to hiss with falling drops of rain.  By the\ntime that they emerged upon a glade it rained heavily.\n\n\"This is awkward,\" said Grace, with an effort to hide her concern.\n\nWinterborne stopped.  \"Grace,\" he said, preserving a strictly business\nmanner which belied him, \"you cannot go to Sherton to-night.\"\n\n\"But I must!\"\n\n\"Why? It is nine miles from here.  It is almost an impossibility in\nthis rain.\"\n\n\"True--WHY?\" she replied, mournfully, at the end of a silence. \"What is\nreputation to me?\"\n\n\"Now hearken,\" said Giles.  \"You won't--go back to your--\"\n\n\"No, no, no!  Don't make me!\" she cried, piteously.\n\n\"Then let us turn.\" They slowly retraced their steps, and again stood\nbefore his door.  \"Now, this house from this moment is yours, and not\nmine,\" he said, deliberately.  \"I have a place near by where I can stay\nvery well.\"\n\nHer face had drooped.  \"Oh!\" she murmured, as she saw the dilemma.\n\"What have I done!\"\n\nThere was a smell of something burning within, and he looked through\nthe window.  The rabbit that he had been cooking to coax a weak\nappetite was beginning to char.  \"Please go in and attend to it,\" he\nsaid.  \"Do what you like.  Now I leave.  You will find everything about\nthe hut that is necessary.\"\n\n\"But, Giles--your supper,\" she exclaimed.  \"An out-house would do for\nme--anything--till to-morrow at day-break!\"\n\nHe signified a negative.  \"I tell you to go in--you may catch agues out\nhere in your delicate state.  You can give me my supper through the\nwindow, if you feel well enough.  I'll wait a while.\"\n\nHe gently urged her to pass the door-way, and was relieved when he saw\nher within the room sitting down.  Without so much as crossing the\nthreshold himself, he closed the door upon her, and turned the key in\nthe lock.  Tapping at the window, he signified that she should open the\ncasement, and when she had done this he handed in the key to her.\n\n\"You are locked in,\" he said; \"and your own mistress.\"\n\nEven in her trouble she could not refrain from a faint smile at his\nscrupulousness, as she took the door-key.\n\n\"Do you feel better?\" he went on.  \"If so, and you wish to give me some\nof your supper, please do.  If not, it is of no importance. I can get\nsome elsewhere.\"\n\nThe grateful sense of his kindness stirred her to action, though she\nonly knew half what that kindness really was.  At the end of some ten\nminutes she again came to the window, pushed it open, and said in a\nwhisper, \"Giles!\"  He at once emerged from the shade, and saw that she\nwas preparing to hand him his share of the meal upon a plate.\n\n\"I don't like to treat you so hardly,\" she murmured, with deep regret\nin her words as she heard the rain pattering on the leaves. \"But--I\nsuppose it is best to arrange like this?\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" he said, quickly.\n\n\"I feel that I could never have reached Sherton.\"\n\n\"It was impossible.\"\n\n\"Are you sure you have a snug place out there?\" (With renewed\nmisgiving.)\n\n\"Quite.  Have you found everything you want? I am afraid it is rather\nrough accommodation.\"\n\n\"Can I notice defects?  I have long passed that stage, and you know it,\nGiles, or you ought to.\"\n\nHis eyes sadly contemplated her face as its pale responsiveness\nmodulated through a crowd of expressions that showed only too clearly\nto what a pitch she was strung.  If ever Winterborne's heart fretted\nhis bosom it was at this sight of a perfectly defenceless creature\nconditioned by such circumstances.  He forgot his own agony in the\nsatisfaction of having at least found her a shelter.  He took his plate\nand cup from her hands, saying, \"Now I'll push the shutter to, and you\nwill find an iron pin on the inside, which you must fix into the bolt.\nDo not stir in the morning till I come and call you.\"\n\nShe expressed an alarmed hope that he would not go very far away.\n\n\"Oh no--I shall be quite within hail,\" said Winterborne.\n\nShe bolted the window as directed, and he retreated.  His snug place\nproved to be a wretched little shelter of the roughest kind, formed of\nfour hurdles thatched with brake-fern.  Underneath were dry sticks,\nhay, and other litter of the sort, upon which he sat down; and there in\nthe dark tried to eat his meal.  But his appetite was quite gone.  He\npushed the plate aside, and shook up the hay and sacks, so as to form a\nrude couch, on which he flung himself down to sleep, for it was getting\nlate.\n\nBut sleep he could not, for many reasons, of which not the least was\nthought of his charge.  He sat up, and looked towards the cot through\nthe damp obscurity.  With all its external features the same as usual,\nhe could scarcely believe that it contained the dear friend--he would\nnot use a warmer name--who had come to him so unexpectedly, and, he\ncould not help admitting, so rashly.\n\nHe had not ventured to ask her any particulars; but the position was\npretty clear without them.  Though social law had negatived forever\ntheir opening paradise of the previous June, it was not without stoical\npride that he accepted the present trying conjuncture.  There was one\nman on earth in whom she believed absolutely, and he was that man.\nThat this crisis could end in nothing but sorrow was a view for a\nmoment effaced by this triumphant thought of her trust in him; and the\npurity of the affection with which he responded to that trust rendered\nhim more than proof against any frailty that besieged him in relation\nto her.\n\nThe rain, which had never ceased, now drew his attention by beginning\nto drop through the meagre screen that covered him.  He rose to attempt\nsome remedy for this discomfort, but the trembling of his knees and the\nthrobbing of his pulse told him that in his weakness he was unable to\nfence against the storm, and he lay down to bear it as best he might.\nHe was angry with himself for his feebleness--he who had been so\nstrong.  It was imperative that she should know nothing of his present\nstate, and to do that she must not see his face by daylight, for its\ncolor would inevitably betray him.\n\nThe next morning, accordingly, when it was hardly light, he rose and\ndragged his stiff limbs about the precincts, preparing for her\neverything she could require for getting breakfast within.  On the\nbench outside the window-sill he placed water, wood, and other\nnecessaries, writing with a piece of chalk beside them, \"It is best\nthat I should not see you.  Put my breakfast on the bench.\"\n\nAt seven o'clock he tapped at her window, as he had promised,\nretreating at once, that she might not catch sight of him.  But from\nhis shelter under the boughs he could see her very well, when, in\nresponse to his signal, she opened the window and the light fell upon\nher face.  The languid largeness of her eyes showed that her sleep had\nbeen little more than his own, and the pinkness of their lids, that her\nwaking hours had not been free from tears.\n\nShe read the writing, seemed, he thought, disappointed, but took up the\nmaterials he had provided, evidently thinking him some way off.  Giles\nwaited on, assured that a girl who, in spite of her culture, knew what\ncountry life was, would find no difficulty in the simple preparation of\ntheir food.\n\nWithin the cot it was all very much as he conjectured, though Grace had\nslept much longer than he.  After the loneliness of the night, she\nwould have been glad to see him; but appreciating his feeling when she\nread the writing, she made no attempt to recall him.  She found\nabundance of provisions laid in, his plan being to replenish his\nbuttery weekly, and this being the day after the victualling van had\ncalled from Sherton.  When the meal was ready, she put what he required\noutside, as she had done with the supper; and, notwithstanding her\nlonging to see him, withdrew from the window promptly, and left him to\nhimself.\n\nIt had been a leaden dawn, and the rain now steadily renewed its fall.\nAs she heard no more of Winterborne, she concluded that he had gone\naway to his daily work, and forgotten that he had promised to accompany\nher to Sherton; an erroneous conclusion, for he remained all day, by\nforce of his condition, within fifty yards of where she was.  The\nmorning wore on; and in her doubt when to start, and how to travel, she\nlingered yet, keeping the door carefully bolted, lest an intruder\nshould discover her.  Locked in this place, she was comparatively safe,\nat any rate, and doubted if she would be safe elsewhere.\n\nThe humid gloom of an ordinary wet day was doubled by the shade and\ndrip of the leafage.  Autumn, this year, was coming in with rains.\nGazing, in her enforced idleness, from the one window of the\nliving-room, she could see various small members of the animal\ncommunity that lived unmolested there--creatures of hair, fluff, and\nscale, the toothed kind and the billed kind; underground creatures,\njointed and ringed--circumambulating the hut, under the impression\nthat, Giles having gone away, nobody was there; and eying it\ninquisitively with a view to winter-quarters.  Watching these\nneighbors, who knew neither law nor sin, distracted her a little from\nher trouble; and she managed to while away some portion of the\nafternoon by putting Giles's home in order and making little\nimprovements which she deemed that he would value when she was gone.\n\nOnce or twice she fancied that she heard a faint noise amid the trees,\nresembling a cough; but as it never came any nearer she concluded that\nit was a squirrel or a bird.\n\nAt last the daylight lessened, and she made up a larger fire for the\nevenings were chilly.  As soon as it was too dark--which was\ncomparatively early--to discern the human countenance in this place of\nshadows, there came to the window to her great delight, a tapping which\nshe knew from its method to be Giles's.\n\nShe opened the casement instantly, and put out her hand to him, though\nshe could only just perceive his outline.  He clasped her fingers, and\nshe noticed the heat of his palm and its shakiness.\n\n\"He has been walking fast, in order to get here quickly,\" she thought.\nHow could she know that he had just crawled out from the straw of the\nshelter hard by; and that the heat of his hand was feverishness?\n\n\"My dear, good Giles!\" she burst out, impulsively.\n\n\"Anybody would have done it for you,\" replied Winterborne, with as much\nmatter-of-fact as he could summon.\n\n\"About my getting to Exbury?\" she said.\n\n\"I have been thinking,\" responded Giles, with tender deference, \"that\nyou had better stay where you are for the present, if you wish not to\nbe caught.  I need not tell you that the place is yours as long as you\nlike; and perhaps in a day or two, finding you absent, he will go away.\nAt any rate, in two or three days I could do anything to assist--such\nas make inquiries, or go a great way towards Sherton-Abbas with you;\nfor the cider season will soon be coming on, and I want to run down to\nthe Vale to see how the crops are, and I shall go by the Sherton road.\nBut for a day or two I am busy here.\"  He was hoping that by the time\nmentioned he would be strong enough to engage himself actively on her\nbehalf. \"I hope you do not feel over-much melancholy in being a\nprisoner?\"\n\nShe declared that she did not mind it; but she sighed.\n\nFrom long acquaintance they could read each other's heart-symptoms like\nbooks of large type.  \"I fear you are sorry you came,\" said Giles, \"and\nthat you think I should have advised you more firmly than I did not to\nstay.\"\n\n\"Oh no, dear, dear friend,\" answered Grace, with a heaving bosom.\n\"Don't think that that is what I regret.  What I regret is my enforced\ntreatment of you--dislodging you, excluding you from your own house.\nWhy should I not speak out? You know what I feel for you--what I have\nfelt for no other living man, what I shall never feel for a man again!\nBut as I have vowed myself to somebody else than you, and cannot be\nreleased, I must behave as I do behave, and keep that vow.  I am not\nbound to him by any divine law, after what he has done; but I have\npromised, and I will pay.\"\n\nThe rest of the evening was passed in his handing her such things as\nshe would require the next day, and casual remarks thereupon, an\noccupation which diverted her mind to some degree from pathetic views\nof her attitude towards him, and of her life in general. The only\ninfringement--if infringement it could be called--of his predetermined\nbearing towards her was an involuntary pressing of her hand to his lips\nwhen she put it through the casement to bid him good-night.  He knew\nshe was weeping, though he could not see her tears.\n\nShe again entreated his forgiveness for so selfishly appropriating the\ncottage.  But it would only be for a day or two more, she thought,\nsince go she must.\n\nHe replied, yearningly, \"I--I don't like you to go away.\"\n\n\"Oh, Giles,\" said she, \"I know--I know! But--I am a woman, and you are\na man.  I cannot speak more plainly.  'Whatsoever things are pure,\nwhatsoever things are of good report'--you know what is in my mind,\nbecause you know me so well.\"\n\n\"Yes, Grace, yes.  I do not at all mean that the question between us\nhas not been settled by the fact of your marriage turning out\nhopelessly unalterable.  I merely meant--well, a feeling no more.\"\n\n\"In a week, at the outside, I should be discovered if I stayed here:\nand I think that by law he could compel me to return to him.\"\n\n\"Yes; perhaps you are right.  Go when you wish, dear Grace.\"\n\nHis last words that evening were a hopeful remark that all might be\nwell with her yet; that Mr. Fitzpiers would not intrude upon her life,\nif he found that his presence cost her so much pain. Then the window\nwas closed, the shutters folded, and the rustle of his footsteps died\naway.\n\nNo sooner had she retired to rest that night than the wind began to\nrise, and, after a few prefatory blasts, to be accompanied by rain.\nThe wind grew more violent, and as the storm went on, it was difficult\nto believe that no opaque body, but only an invisible colorless thing,\nwas trampling and climbing over the roof, making branches creak,\nspringing out of the trees upon the chimney, popping its head into the\nflue, and shrieking and blaspheming at every corner of the walls.  As\nin the old story, the assailant was a spectre which could be felt but\nnot seen.  She had never before been so struck with the devilry of a\ngusty night in a wood, because she had never been so entirely alone in\nspirit as she was now.  She seemed almost to be apart from herself--a\nvacuous duplicate only.  The recent self of physical animation and\nclear intentions was not there.\n\nSometimes a bough from an adjoining tree was swayed so low as to smite\nthe roof in the manner of a gigantic hand smiting the mouth of an\nadversary, to be followed by a trickle of rain, as blood from the\nwound.  To all this weather Giles must be more or less exposed; how\nmuch, she did not know.\n\nAt last Grace could hardly endure the idea of such a hardship in\nrelation to him.  Whatever he was suffering, it was she who had caused\nit; he vacated his house on account of her.  She was not worth such\nself-sacrifice; she should not have accepted it of him. And then, as\nher anxiety increased with increasing thought, there returned upon her\nmind some incidents of her late intercourse with him, which she had\nheeded but little at the time.  The look of his face--what had there\nbeen about his face which seemed different from its appearance as of\nyore?  Was it not thinner, less rich in hue, less like that of ripe\nautumn's brother to whom she had formerly compared him? And his voice;\nshe had distinctly noticed a change in tone.  And his gait; surely it\nhad been feebler, stiffer, more like the gait of a weary man.  That\nslight occasional noise she had heard in the day, and attributed to\nsquirrels, it might have been his cough after all.\n\nThus conviction took root in her perturbed mind that Winterborne was\nill, or had been so, and that he had carefully concealed his condition\nfrom her that she might have no scruples about accepting a hospitality\nwhich by the nature of the case expelled her entertainer.\n\n\"My own, own, true l----, my dear kind friend!\" she cried to herself.\n\"Oh, it shall not be--it shall not be!\"\n\nShe hastily wrapped herself up, and obtained a light, with which she\nentered the adjoining room, the cot possessing only one floor. Setting\ndown the candle on the table here, she went to the door with the key in\nher hand, and placed it in the lock.  Before turning it she paused, her\nfingers still clutching it; and pressing her other hand to her\nforehead, she fell into agitating thought.\n\nA tattoo on the window, caused by the tree-droppings blowing against\nit, brought her indecision to a close.  She turned the key and opened\nthe door.\n\nThe darkness was intense, seeming to touch her pupils like a substance.\nShe only now became aware how heavy the rainfall had been and was; the\ndripping of the eaves splashed like a fountain. She stood listening\nwith parted lips, and holding the door in one hand, till her eyes,\ngrowing accustomed to the obscurity, discerned the wild brandishing of\ntheir boughs by the adjoining trees.  At last she cried loudly with an\neffort, \"Giles! you may come in!\"\n\nThere was no immediate answer to her cry, and overpowered by her own\ntemerity, Grace retreated quickly, shut the door, and stood looking on\nthe floor.  But it was not for long.  She again lifted the latch, and\nwith far more determination than at first.\n\n\"Giles, Giles!\" she cried, with the full strength of her voice, and\nwithout any of the shamefacedness that had characterized her first cry.\n\"Oh, come in--come in!  Where are you?  I have been wicked.  I have\nthought too much of myself!  Do you hear?  I don't want to keep you out\nany longer.  I cannot bear that you should suffer so.  Gi-i-iles!\"\n\nA reply! It was a reply! Through the darkness and wind a voice reached\nher, floating upon the weather as though a part of it.\n\n\"Here I am--all right.  Don't trouble about me.\"\n\n\"Don't you want to come in? Are you not ill? I don't mind what they\nsay, or what they think any more.\"\n\n\"I am all right,\" he repeated.  \"It is not necessary for me to come.\nGood-night! good-night!\"\n\nGrace sighed, turned and shut the door slowly.  Could she have been\nmistaken about his health? Perhaps, after all, she had perceived a\nchange in him because she had not seen him for so long.  Time sometimes\ndid his ageing work in jerks, as she knew. Well, she had done all she\ncould.  He would not come in.  She retired to rest again.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII.\n\nThe next morning Grace was at the window early.  She felt determined to\nsee him somehow that day, and prepared his breakfast eagerly.  Eight\no'clock struck, and she had remembered that he had not come to arouse\nher by a knocking, as usual, her own anxiety having caused her to stir.\n\nThe breakfast was set in its place without.  But he did not arrive to\ntake it; and she waited on.  Nine o'clock arrived, and the breakfast\nwas cold; and still there was no Giles.  A thrush, that had been\nrepeating itself a good deal on an opposite bush for some time, came\nand took a morsel from the plate and bolted it, waited, looked around,\nand took another.  At ten o'clock she drew in the tray, and sat down to\nher own solitary meal.  He must have been called away on business\nearly, the rain having cleared off.\n\nYet she would have liked to assure herself, by thoroughly exploring the\nprecincts of the hut, that he was nowhere in its vicinity; but as the\nday was comparatively fine, the dread lest some stray passenger or\nwoodman should encounter her in such a reconnoitre paralyzed her wish.\nThe solitude was further accentuated to-day by the stopping of the\nclock for want of winding, and the fall into the chimney-corner of\nflakes of soot loosened by the rains.  At noon she heard a slight\nrustling outside the window, and found that it was caused by an eft\nwhich had crept out of the leaves to bask in the last sun-rays that\nwould be worth having till the following May.\n\nShe continually peeped out through the lattice, but could see little.\nIn front lay the brown leaves of last year, and upon them some\nyellowish-green ones of this season that had been prematurely blown\ndown by the gale.  Above stretched an old beech, with vast armpits, and\ngreat pocket-holes in its sides where branches had been amputated in\npast times; a black slug was trying to climb it. Dead boughs were\nscattered about like ichthyosauri in a museum, and beyond them were\nperishing woodbine stems resembling old ropes.\n\nFrom the other window all she could see were more trees, jacketed with\nlichen and stockinged with moss.  At their roots were stemless yellow\nfungi like lemons and apricots, and tall fungi with more stem than\nstool.  Next were more trees close together, wrestling for existence,\ntheir branches disfigured with wounds resulting from their mutual\nrubbings and blows.  It was the struggle between these neighbors that\nshe had heard in the night. Beneath them were the rotting stumps of\nthose of the group that had been vanquished long ago, rising from their\nmossy setting like decayed teeth from green gums.  Farther on were\nother tufts of moss in islands divided by the shed leaves--variety upon\nvariety, dark green and pale green; moss-like little fir-trees, like\nplush, like malachite stars, like nothing on earth except moss.\n\nThe strain upon Grace's mind in various ways was so great on this the\nmost desolate day she had passed there that she felt it would be\nwell-nigh impossible to spend another in such circumstances. The\nevening came at last; the sun, when its chin was on the earth, found an\nopening through which to pierce the shade, and stretched irradiated\ngauzes across the damp atmosphere, making the wet trunks shine, and\nthrowing splotches of such ruddiness on the leaves beneath the beech\nthat they were turned to gory hues.  When night at last arrived, and\nwith it the time for his return, she was nearly broken down with\nsuspense.\n\nThe simple evening meal, partly tea, partly supper, which Grace had\nprepared, stood waiting upon the hearth; and yet Giles did not come.\nIt was now nearly twenty-four hours since she had seen him. As the room\ngrew darker, and only the firelight broke against the gloom of the\nwalls, she was convinced that it would be beyond her staying power to\npass the night without hearing from him or from somebody.  Yet eight\no'clock drew on, and his form at the window did not appear.\n\nThe meal remained untasted.  Suddenly rising from before the hearth of\nsmouldering embers, where she had been crouching with her hands clasped\nover her knees, she crossed the room, unlocked the door, and listened.\nEvery breath of wind had ceased with the decline of day, but the rain\nhad resumed the steady dripping of the night before.  Grace might have\nstood there five minutes when she fancied she heard that old sound, a\ncough, at no great distance; and it was presently repeated.  If it were\nWinterborne's, he must be near her; why, then, had he not visited her?\n\nA horrid misgiving that he could not visit her took possession of\nGrace, and she looked up anxiously for the lantern, which was hanging\nabove her head.  To light it and go in the direction of the sound would\nbe the obvious way to solve the dread problem; but the conditions made\nher hesitate, and in a moment a cold sweat pervaded her at further\nsounds from the same quarter.\n\nThey were low mutterings; at first like persons in conversation, but\ngradually resolving themselves into varieties of one voice. It was an\nendless monologue, like that we sometimes hear from inanimate nature in\ndeep secret places where water flows, or where ivy leaves flap against\nstones; but by degrees she was convinced that the voice was\nWinterborne's.  Yet who could be his listener, so mute and patient; for\nthough he argued so rapidly and persistently, nobody replied.\n\nA dreadful enlightenment spread through the mind of Grace.  \"Oh,\" she\ncried, in her anguish, as she hastily prepared herself to go out, \"how\nselfishly correct I am always--too, too correct! Cruel propriety is\nkilling the dearest heart that ever woman clasped to her own.\"\n\nWhile speaking thus to herself she had lit the lantern, and hastening\nout without further thought, took the direction whence the mutterings\nhad proceeded.  The course was marked by a little path, which ended at\na distance of about forty yards in a small erection of hurdles, not\nmuch larger than a shock of corn, such as were frequent in the woods\nand copses when the cutting season was going on.  It was too slight\neven to be called a hovel, and was not high enough to stand upright in;\nappearing, in short, to be erected for the temporary shelter of fuel.\nThe side towards Grace was open, and turning the light upon the\ninterior, she beheld what her prescient fear had pictured in snatches\nall the way thither.\n\nUpon the straw within, Winterborne lay in his clothes, just as she had\nseen him during the whole of her stay here, except that his hat was\noff, and his hair matted and wild.\n\nBoth his clothes and the straw were saturated with rain.  His arms were\nflung over his head; his face was flushed to an unnatural crimson.  His\neyes had a burning brightness, and though they met her own, she\nperceived that he did not recognize her.\n\n\"Oh, my Giles,\" she cried, \"what have I done to you!\"\n\nBut she stopped no longer even to reproach herself.  She saw that the\nfirst thing to be thought of was to get him indoors.\n\nHow Grace performed that labor she never could have exactly explained.\nBut by dint of clasping her arms round him, rearing him into a sitting\nposture, and straining her strength to the uttermost, she put him on\none of the hurdles that was loose alongside, and taking the end of it\nin both her hands, dragged him along the path to the entrance of the\nhut, and, after a pause for breath, in at the door-way.\n\nIt was somewhat singular that Giles in his semi-conscious state\nacquiesced unresistingly in all that she did.  But he never for a\nmoment recognized her--continuing his rapid conversation to himself,\nand seeming to look upon her as some angel, or other supernatural\ncreature of the visionary world in which he was mentally living.  The\nundertaking occupied her more than ten minutes; but by that time, to\nher great thankfulness, he was in the inner room, lying on the bed, his\ndamp outer clothing removed.\n\nThen the unhappy Grace regarded him by the light of the candle. There\nwas something in his look which agonized her, in the rush of his\nthoughts, accelerating their speed from minute to minute.  He seemed to\nbe passing through the universe of ideas like a comet--erratic,\ninapprehensible, untraceable.\n\nGrace's distraction was almost as great as his.  In a few moments she\nfirmly believed he was dying.  Unable to withstand her impulse, she\nknelt down beside him, kissed his hands and his face and his hair,\nexclaiming, in a low voice, \"How could I? How could I?\"\n\nHer timid morality had, indeed, underrated his chivalry till now,\nthough she knew him so well.  The purity of his nature, his freedom\nfrom the grosser passions, his scrupulous delicacy, had never been\nfully understood by Grace till this strange self-sacrifice in lonely\njuxtaposition to her own person was revealed. The perception of it\nadded something that was little short of reverence to the deep\naffection for him of a woman who, herself, had more of Artemis than of\nAphrodite in her constitution.\n\nAll that a tender nurse could do, Grace did; and the power to express\nher solicitude in action, unconscious though the sufferer was, brought\nher mournful satisfaction.  She bathed his hot head, wiped his\nperspiring hands, moistened his lips, cooled his fiery eyelids, sponged\nhis heated skin, and administered whatever she could find in the house\nthat the imagination could conceive as likely to be in any way\nalleviating.  That she might have been the cause, or partially the\ncause, of all this, interfused misery with her sorrow.\n\nSix months before this date a scene, almost similar in its mechanical\nparts, had been enacted at Hintock House.  It was between a pair of\npersons most intimately connected in their lives with these.  Outwardly\nlike as it had been, it was yet infinite in spiritual difference,\nthough a woman's devotion had been common to both.\n\nGrace rose from her attitude of affection, and, bracing her energies,\nsaw that something practical must immediately be done. Much as she\nwould have liked, in the emotion of the moment, to keep him entirely to\nherself, medical assistance was necessary while there remained a\npossibility of preserving him alive.  Such assistance was fatal to her\nown concealment; but even had the chance of benefiting him been less\nthan it was, she would have run the hazard for his sake.  The question\nwas, where should she get a medical man, competent and near?\n\nThere was one such man, and only one, within accessible distance; a man\nwho, if it were possible to save Winterborne's life, had the brain most\nlikely to do it.  If human pressure could bring him, that man ought to\nbe brought to the sick Giles's side.  The attempt should be made.\n\nYet she dreaded to leave her patient, and the minutes raced past, and\nyet she postponed her departure.  At last, when it was after eleven\no'clock, Winterborne fell into a fitful sleep, and it seemed to afford\nher an opportunity.\n\nShe hastily made him as comfortable as she could, put on her things,\ncut a new candle from the bunch hanging in the cupboard, and having set\nit up, and placed it so that the light did not fall upon his eyes, she\nclosed the door and started.\n\nThe spirit of Winterborne seemed to keep her company and banish all\nsense of darkness from her mind.  The rains had imparted a\nphosphorescence to the pieces of touchwood and rotting leaves that lay\nabout her path, which, as scattered by her feet, spread abroad like\nspilt milk.  She would not run the hazard of losing her way by plunging\ninto any short, unfrequented track through the denser parts of the\nwoodland, but followed a more open course, which eventually brought her\nto the highway.  Once here, she ran along with great speed, animated by\na devoted purpose which had much about it that was stoical; and it was\nwith scarcely any faltering of spirit that, after an hour's progress,\nshe passed over Rubdown Hill, and onward towards that same Hintock, and\nthat same house, out of which she had fled a few days before in\nirresistible alarm. But that had happened which, above all other things\nof chance and change, could make her deliberately frustrate her plan of\nflight and sink all regard of personal consequences.\n\nOne speciality of Fitzpiers's was respected by Grace as much as\never--his professional skill.  In this she was right.  Had his\npersistence equalled his insight, instead of being the spasmodic and\nfitful thing it was, fame and fortune need never have remained a wish\nwith him.  His freedom from conventional errors and crusted prejudices\nhad, indeed, been such as to retard rather than accelerate his advance\nin Hintock and its neighborhood, where people could not believe that\nnature herself effected cures, and that the doctor's business was only\nto smooth the way.\n\nIt was past midnight when Grace arrived opposite her father's house,\nnow again temporarily occupied by her husband, unless he had already\ngone away.  Ever since her emergence from the denser plantations about\nWinterborne's residence a pervasive lightness had hung in the damp\nautumn sky, in spite of the vault of cloud, signifying that a moon of\nsome age was shining above its arch. The two white gates were distinct,\nand the white balls on the pillars, and the puddles and damp ruts left\nby the recent rain, had a cold, corpse-eyed luminousness.  She entered\nby the lower gate, and crossed the quadrangle to the wing wherein the\napartments that had been hers since her marriage were situate, till she\nstood under a window which, if her husband were in the house, gave\nlight to his bedchamber.\n\nShe faltered, and paused with her hand on her heart, in spite of\nherself.  Could she call to her presence the very cause of all her\nforegoing troubles? Alas!--old Jones was seven miles off; Giles was\npossibly dying--what else could she do?\n\nIt was in a perspiration, wrought even more by consciousness than by\nexercise, that she picked up some gravel, threw it at the panes, and\nwaited to see the result.  The night-bell which had been fixed when\nFitzpiers first took up his residence there still remained; but as it\nhad fallen into disuse with the collapse of his practice, and his\nelopement, she did not venture to pull it now.\n\nWhoever slept in the room had heard her signal, slight as it was. In\nhalf a minute the window was opened, and a voice said \"Yes?\"\ninquiringly.  Grace recognized her husband in the speaker at once. Her\neffort was now to disguise her own accents.\n\n\"Doctor,\" she said, in as unusual a tone as she could command, \"a man\nis dangerously ill in One-chimney Hut, out towards Delborough, and you\nmust go to him at once--in all mercy!\"\n\n\"I will, readily.\"\n\nThe alacrity, surprise, and pleasure expressed in his reply amazed her\nfor a moment.  But, in truth, they denoted the sudden relief of a man\nwho, having got back in a mood of contrition, from erratic abandonment\nto fearful joys, found the soothing routine of professional practice\nunexpectedly opening anew to him.  The highest desire of his soul just\nnow was for a respectable life of painstaking.  If this, his first\nsummons since his return, had been to attend upon a cat or dog, he\nwould scarcely have refused it in the circumstances.\n\n\"Do you know the way?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" said he.\n\n\"One-chimney Hut,\" she repeated.  \"And--immediately!\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Fitzpiers.\n\nGrace remained no longer.  She passed out of the white gate without\nslamming it, and hastened on her way back.  Her husband, then, had\nre-entered her father's house.  How he had been able to effect a\nreconciliation with the old man, what were the terms of the treaty\nbetween them, she could not so much as conjecture. Some sort of truce\nmust have been entered into, that was all she could say.  But close as\nthe question lay to her own life, there was a more urgent one which\nbanished it; and she traced her steps quickly along the meandering\ntrack-ways.\n\nMeanwhile, Fitzpiers was preparing to leave the house.  The state of\nhis mind, over and above his professional zeal, was peculiar. At\nGrace's first remark he had not recognized or suspected her presence;\nbut as she went on, he was awakened to the great resemblance of the\nspeaker's voice to his wife's.  He had taken in such good faith the\nstatement of the household on his arrival, that she had gone on a visit\nfor a time because she could not at once bring her mind to be\nreconciled to him, that he could not quite actually believe this comer\nto be she.  It was one of the features of Fitzpiers's repentant humor\nat this date that, on receiving the explanation of her absence, he had\nmade no attempt to outrage her feelings by following her; though nobody\nhad informed him how very shortly her departure had preceded his entry,\nand of all that might have been inferred from her precipitancy.\n\nMelbury, after much alarm and consideration, had decided not to follow\nher either.  He sympathized with her flight, much as he deplored it;\nmoreover, the tragic color of the antecedent events that he had been a\ngreat means of creating checked his instinct to interfere.  He prayed\nand trusted that she had got into no danger on her way (as he supposed)\nto Sherton, and thence to Exbury, if that were the place she had gone\nto, forbearing all inquiry which the strangeness of her departure would\nhave made natural.  A few months before this time a performance by\nGrace of one-tenth the magnitude of this would have aroused him to\nunwonted investigation.\n\nIt was in the same spirit that he had tacitly assented to Fitzpiers's\ndomicilation there.  The two men had not met face to face, but Mrs.\nMelbury had proposed herself as an intermediary, who made the surgeon's\nre-entrance comparatively easy to him. Everything was provisional, and\nnobody asked questions.  Fitzpiers had come in the performance of a\nplan of penitence, which had originated in circumstances hereafter to\nbe explained; his self-humiliation to the very bass-string was\ndeliberate; and as soon as a call reached him from the bedside of a\ndying man his desire was to set to work and do as much good as he could\nwith the least possible fuss or show.  He therefore refrained from\ncalling up a stableman to get ready any horse or gig, and set out for\nOne-chimney Hut on foot, as Grace had done.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII.\n\nShe re-entered the hut, flung off her bonnet and cloak, and approached\nthe sufferer.  He had begun anew those terrible mutterings, and his\nhands were cold.  As soon as she saw him there returned to her that\nagony of mind which the stimulus of her journey had thrown off for a\ntime.\n\nCould he really be dying? She bathed him, kissed him, forgot all things\nbut the fact that lying there before her was he who had loved her more\nthan the mere lover would have loved; had martyred himself for her\ncomfort, cared more for her self-respect than she had thought of\ncaring.  This mood continued till she heard quick, smart footsteps\nwithout; she knew whose footsteps they were.\n\nGrace sat on the inside of the bed against the wall, holding Giles's\nhand, so that when her husband entered the patient lay between herself\nand him.  He stood transfixed at first, noticing Grace only.  Slowly he\ndropped his glance and discerned who the prostrate man was.  Strangely\nenough, though Grace's distaste for her husband's company had amounted\nalmost to dread, and culminated in actual flight, at this moment her\nlast and least feeling was personal.  Sensitive femininity was eclipsed\nby self-effacing purpose, and that it was a husband who stood there was\nforgotten. The first look that possessed her face was relief;\nsatisfaction at the presence of the physician obliterated thought of\nthe man, which only returned in the form of a sub-consciousness that\ndid not interfere with her words.\n\n\"Is he dying--is there any hope?\" she cried.\n\n\"Grace!\" said Fitzpiers, in an indescribable whisper--more than\ninvocating, if not quite deprecatory.\n\nHe was arrested by the spectacle, not so much in its intrinsic\ncharacter--though that was striking enough to a man who called himself\nthe husband of the sufferer's friend and nurse--but in its character as\nthe counterpart of one that had its hour many months before, in which\nhe had figured as the patient, and the woman had been Felice Charmond.\n\n\"Is he in great danger--can you save him?\" she cried again.\n\nFitzpiers aroused himself, came a little nearer, and examined\nWinterborne as he stood.  His inspection was concluded in a mere\nglance.  Before he spoke he looked at her contemplatively as to the\neffect of his coming words.\n\n\"He is dying,\" he said, with dry precision.\n\n\"What?\" said she.\n\n\"Nothing can be done, by me or any other man.  It will soon be all\nover.  The extremities are dead already.\"  His eyes still remained\nfixed on her; the conclusion to which he had come seeming to end his\ninterest, professional and otherwise, in Winterborne forever.\n\n\"But it cannot be!  He was well three days ago.\"\n\n\"Not well, I suspect.  This seems like a secondary attack, which has\nfollowed some previous illness--possibly typhoid--it may have been\nmonths ago, or recently.\"\n\n\"Ah--he was not well--you are right.  He was ill--he was ill when I\ncame.\"\n\nThere was nothing more to do or say.  She crouched down at the side of\nthe bed, and Fitzpiers took a seat.  Thus they remained in silence, and\nlong as it lasted she never turned her eyes, or apparently her\nthoughts, at all to her husband.  He occasionally murmured, with\nautomatic authority, some slight directions for alleviating the pain of\nthe dying man, which she mechanically obeyed, bending over him during\nthe intervals in silent tears.\n\nWinterborne never recovered consciousness of what was passing; and that\nhe was going became soon perceptible also to her.  In less than an hour\nthe delirium ceased; then there was an interval of somnolent\npainlessness and soft breathing, at the end of which Winterborne passed\nquietly away.\n\n\nThen Fitzpiers broke the silence.  \"Have you lived here long?\" said he.\n\nGrace was wild with sorrow--with all that had befallen her--with the\ncruelties that had attacked her--with life--with Heaven.  She answered\nat random.  \"Yes.  By what right do you ask?\"\n\n\"Don't think I claim any right,\" said Fitzpiers, sadly.  \"It is for you\nto do and say what you choose.  I admit, quite as much as you feel,\nthat I am a vagabond--a brute--not worthy to possess the smallest\nfragment of you.  But here I am, and I have happened to take sufficient\ninterest in you to make that inquiry.\"\n\n\"He is everything to me!\" said Grace, hardly heeding her husband, and\nlaying her hand reverently on the dead man's eyelids, where she kept it\na long time, pressing down their lashes with gentle touches, as if she\nwere stroking a little bird.\n\nHe watched her a while, and then glanced round the chamber where his\neyes fell upon a few dressing necessaries that she had brought.\n\n\"Grace--if I may call you so,\" he said, \"I have been already humiliated\nalmost to the depths.  I have come back since you refused to join me\nelsewhere--I have entered your father's house, and borne all that that\ncost me without flinching, because I have felt that I deserved\nhumiliation.  But is there a yet greater humiliation in store for me?\nYou say you have been living here--that he is everything to you.  Am I\nto draw from that the obvious, the extremest inference?\"\n\nTriumph at any price is sweet to men and women--especially the latter.\nIt was her first and last opportunity of repaying him for the cruel\ncontumely which she had borne at his hands so docilely.\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered; and there was that in her subtly compounded nature\nwhich made her feel a thrill of pride as she did so.\n\nYet the moment after she had so mightily belied her character she half\nrepented.  Her husband had turned as white as the wall behind him.  It\nseemed as if all that remained to him of life and spirit had been\nabstracted at a stroke.  Yet he did not move, and in his efforts at\nself-control closed his mouth together as a vice.  His determination\nwas fairly successful, though she saw how very much greater than she\nhad expected her triumph had been.  Presently he looked across at\nWinterborne.\n\n\"Would it startle you to hear,\" he said, as if he hardly had breath to\nutter the words, \"that she who was to me what he was to you is dead\nalso?\"\n\n\"Dead--SHE dead?\" exclaimed Grace.\n\n\"Yes.  Felice Charmond is where this young man is.\"\n\n\"Never!\" said Grace, vehemently.\n\nHe went on without heeding the insinuation: \"And I came back to try to\nmake it up with you--but--\"\n\nFitzpiers rose, and moved across the room to go away, looking downward\nwith the droop of a man whose hope was turned to apathy, if not\ndespair.  In going round the door his eye fell upon her once more.  She\nwas still bending over the body of Winterborne, her face close to the\nyoung man's.\n\n\"Have you been kissing him during his illness?\" asked her husband.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Since his fevered state set in?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"On his lips?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then you will do well to take a few drops of this in water as soon as\npossible.\" He drew a small phial from his pocket and returned to offer\nit to her.\n\nGrace shook her head.\n\n\"If you don't do as I tell you you may soon be like him.\"\n\n\"I don't care.  I wish to die.\"\n\n\"I'll put it here,\" said Fitzpiers, placing the bottle on a ledge\nbeside him.  \"The sin of not having warned you will not be upon my head\nat any rate, among my other sins.  I am now going, and I will send\nsomebody to you.  Your father does not know that you are here, so I\nsuppose I shall be bound to tell him?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\nFitzpiers left the cot, and the stroke of his feet was soon immersed in\nthe silence that pervaded the spot.  Grace remained kneeling and\nweeping, she hardly knew how long, and then she sat up, covered poor\nGiles's features, and went towards the door where her husband had\nstood.  No sign of any other comer greeted her ear, the only\nperceptible sounds being the tiny cracklings of the dead leaves, which,\nlike a feather-bed, had not yet done rising to their normal level where\nindented by the pressure of her husband's receding footsteps.  It\nreminded her that she had been struck with the change in his aspect;\nthe extremely intellectual look that had always been in his face was\nwrought to a finer phase by thinness, and a care-worn dignity had been\nsuperadded.  She returned to Winterborne's side, and during her\nmeditations another tread drew near the door, entered the outer room,\nand halted at the entrance of the chamber where Grace was.\n\n\"What--Marty!\" said Grace.\n\n\"Yes.  I have heard,\" said Marty, whose demeanor had lost all its\ngirlishness under the stroke that seemed almost literally to have\nbruised her.\n\n\"He died for me!\" murmured Grace, heavily.\n\nMarty did not fully comprehend; and she answered, \"He belongs to\nneither of us now, and your beauty is no more powerful with him than my\nplainness.  I have come to help you, ma'am.  He never cared for me, and\nhe cared much for you; but he cares for us both alike now.\"\n\n\"Oh don't, don't, Marty!\"\n\nMarty said no more, but knelt over Winterborne from the other side.\n\n\"Did you meet my hus--Mr. Fitzpiers?\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"Then what brought you here?\"\n\n\"I come this way sometimes.  I have got to go to the farther side of\nthe wood this time of the year, and am obliged to get there before four\no'clock in the morning, to begin heating the oven for the early baking.\nI have passed by here often at this time.\"\n\nGrace looked at her quickly.  \"Then did you know I was here?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Did you tell anybody?\"\n\n\"No.  I knew you lived in the hut, that he had gied it up to ye, and\nlodged out himself.\"\n\n\"Did you know where he lodged?\"\n\n\"No.  That I couldn't find out.  Was it at Delborough?\"\n\n\"No.  It was not there, Marty.  Would it had been! It would have\nsaved--saved--\" To check her tears she turned, and seeing a book on the\nwindow-bench, took it up.  \"Look, Marty, this is a Psalter. He was not\nan outwardly religious man, but he was pure and perfect in his heart.\nShall we read a psalm over him?\"\n\n\"Oh yes--we will--with all my heart!\"\n\nGrace opened the thin brown book, which poor Giles had kept at hand\nmainly for the convenience of whetting his pen-knife upon its leather\ncovers.  She began to read in that rich, devotional voice peculiar to\nwomen only on such occasions.  When it was over, Marty said, \"I should\nlike to pray for his soul.\"\n\n\"So should I,\" said her companion.  \"But we must not.\"\n\n\"Why? Nobody would know.\"\n\nGrace could not resist the argument, influenced as she was by the sense\nof making amends for having neglected him in the body; and their tender\nvoices united and filled the narrow room with supplicatory murmurs that\na Calvinist might have envied.  They had hardly ended when now and more\nnumerous foot-falls were audible, also persons in conversation, one of\nwhom Grace recognized as her father.\n\nShe rose, and went to the outer apartment, in which there was only such\nlight as beamed from the inner one.  Melbury and Mrs. Melbury were\nstanding there.\n\n\"I don't reproach you, Grace,\" said her father, with an estranged\nmanner, and in a voice not at all like his old voice.  \"What has come\nupon you and us is beyond reproach, beyond weeping, and beyond wailing.\nPerhaps I drove you to it.  But I am hurt; I am scourged; I am\nastonished.  In the face of this there is nothing to be said.\"\n\nWithout replying, Grace turned and glided back to the inner chamber.\n\"Marty,\" she said, quickly, \"I cannot look my father in the face until\nhe knows the true circumstances of my life here. Go and tell him--what\nyou have told me--what you saw--that he gave up his house to me.\"\n\nShe sat down, her face buried in her hands, and Marty went, and after a\nshort absence returned.  Then Grace rose, and going out asked her\nfather if he had met her husband.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Melbury.\n\n\"And you know all that has happened?\"\n\n\"I do.  Forgive me, Grace, for suspecting ye of worse than rashness--I\nought to know ye better.  Are you coming with me to what was once your\nhome?\"\n\n\"No.  I stay here with HIM.  Take no account of me any more.\"\n\nThe unwonted, perplexing, agitating relations in which she had stood to\nWinterborne quite lately--brought about by Melbury's own\ncontrivance--could not fail to soften the natural anger of a parent at\nher more recent doings.  \"My daughter, things are bad,\" he rejoined.\n\"But why do you persevere to make 'em worse? What good can you do to\nGiles by staying here with him? Mind, I ask no questions.  I don't\ninquire why you decided to come here, or anything as to what your\ncourse would have been if he had not died, though I know there's no\ndeliberate harm in ye.  As for me, I have lost all claim upon you, and\nI make no complaint.  But I do say that by coming back with me now you\nwill show no less kindness to him, and escape any sound of shame.\n\n\"But I don't wish to escape it.\"\n\n\"If you don't on your own account, cannot you wish to on mine and hers?\nNobody except our household knows that you have left home. Then why\nshould you, by a piece of perverseness, bring down my gray hairs with\nsorrow to the grave?\"\n\n\"If it were not for my husband--\" she began, moved by his words. \"But\nhow can I meet him there? How can any woman who is not a mere man's\ncreature join him after what has taken place?\"\n\n\"He would go away again rather than keep you out of my house.\"\n\n\"How do you know that, father?\"\n\n\"We met him on our way here, and he told us so,\" said Mrs. Melbury.\n\"He had said something like it before.  He seems very much upset\naltogether.\"\n\n\"He declared to her when he came to our house that he would wait for\ntime and devotion to bring about his forgiveness,\" said her husband.\n\"That was it, wasn't it, Lucy?\"\n\n\"Yes.  That he would not intrude upon you, Grace, till you gave him\nabsolute permission,\" Mrs. Melbury added.\n\nThis antecedent considerateness in Fitzpiers was as welcome to Grace as\nit was unexpected; and though she did not desire his presence, she was\nsorry that by her retaliatory fiction she had given him a different\nreason for avoiding her.  She made no further objections to\naccompanying her parents, taking them into the inner room to give\nWinterborne a last look, and gathering up the two or three things that\nbelonged to her.  While she was doing this the two women came who had\nbeen called by Melbury, and at their heels poor Creedle.\n\n\"Forgive me, but I can't rule my mourning nohow as a man should, Mr.\nMelbury,\" he said.  \"I ha'n't seen him since Thursday se'night, and\nhave wondered for days and days where he's been keeping.  There was I\nexpecting him to come and tell me to wash out the cider-barrels against\nthe making, and here was he-- Well, I've knowed him from table-high; I\nknowed his father--used to bide about upon two sticks in the sun afore\nhe died!--and now I've seen the end of the family, which we can ill\nafford to lose, wi' such a scanty lot of good folk in Hintock as we've\ngot.  And now Robert Creedle will be nailed up in parish boards 'a\nb'lieve; and noboby will glutch down a sigh for he!\"\n\nThey started for home, Marty and Creedle remaining behind.  For a time\nGrace and her father walked side by side without speaking. It was just\nin the blue of the dawn, and the chilling tone of the sky was reflected\nin her cold, wet face.  The whole wood seemed to be a house of death,\npervaded by loss to its uttermost length and breadth.  Winterborne was\ngone, and the copses seemed to show the want of him; those young trees,\nso many of which he had planted, and of which he had spoken so truly\nwhen he said that he should fall before they fell, were at that very\nmoment sending out their roots in the direction that he had given them\nwith his subtle hand.\n\n\"One thing made it tolerable to us that your husband should come back\nto the house,\" said Melbury at last--\"the death of Mrs. Charmond.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" said Grace, arousing slightly to the recollection, \"he told\nme so.\"\n\n\"Did he tell you how she died?  It was no such death as Giles's. She\nwas shot--by a disappointed lover.  It occurred in Germany. The\nunfortunate man shot himself afterwards.  He was that South Carolina\ngentleman of very passionate nature who used to haunt this place to\nforce her to an interview, and followed her about everywhere.  So ends\nthe brilliant Felice Charmond--once a good friend to me--but no friend\nto you.\"\n\n\"I can forgive her,\" said Grace, absently.  \"Did Edgar tell you of\nthis?\"\n\n\"No; but he put a London newspaper, giving an account of it, on the\nhall table, folded in such a way that we should see it.  It will be in\nthe Sherton paper this week, no doubt.  To make the event more solemn\nstill to him, he had just before had sharp words with her, and left\nher.  He told Lucy this, as nothing about him appears in the newspaper.\nAnd the cause of the quarrel was, of all people, she we've left behind\nus.\"\n\n\"Do you mean Marty?\" Grace spoke the words but perfunctorily. For,\npertinent and pointed as Melbury's story was, she had no heart for it\nnow.\n\n\"Yes.  Marty South.\"  Melbury persisted in his narrative, to divert her\nfrom her present grief, if possible.  \"Before he went away she wrote\nhim a letter, which he kept in his, pocket a long while before reading.\nHe chanced to pull it out in Mrs. Charmond's, presence, and read it out\nloud.  It contained something which teased her very much, and that led\nto the rupture. She was following him to make it up when she met with\nher terrible death.\"\n\nMelbury did not know enough to give the gist of the incident, which was\nthat Marty South's letter had been concerning a certain personal\nadornment common to herself and Mrs. Charmond.  Her bullet reached its\nbillet at last.  The scene between Fitzpiers and Felice had been sharp,\nas only a scene can be which arises out of the mortification of one\nwoman by another in the presence of a lover.  True, Marty had not\neffected it by word of mouth; the charge about the locks of hair was\nmade simply by Fitzpiers reading her letter to him aloud to Felice in\nthe playfully ironical tones of one who had become a little weary of\nhis situation, and was finding his friend, in the phrase of George\nHerbert, a \"flat delight.\"  He had stroked those false tresses with his\nhand many a time without knowing them to be transplanted, and it was\nimpossible when the discovery was so abruptly made to avoid being\nfinely satirical, despite her generous disposition.\n\nThat was how it had begun, and tragedy had been its end.  On his abrupt\ndeparture she had followed him to the station but the train was gone;\nand in travelling to Baden in search of him she had met his rival,\nwhose reproaches led to an altercation, and the death of both.  Of that\nprecipitate scene of passion and crime Fitzpiers had known nothing till\nhe saw an account of it in the papers, where, fortunately for himself,\nno mention was made of his prior acquaintance with the unhappy lady;\nnor was there any allusion to him in the subsequent inquiry, the double\ndeath being attributed to some gambling losses, though, in point of\nfact, neither one of them had visited the tables.\n\nMelbury and his daughter drew near their house, having seen but one\nliving thing on their way, a squirrel, which did not run up its tree,\nbut, dropping the sweet chestnut which it carried, cried\nchut-chut-chut, and stamped with its hind legs on the ground. When the\nroofs and chimneys of the homestead began to emerge from the screen of\nboughs, Grace started, and checked herself in her abstracted advance.\n\n\"You clearly understand,\" she said to her step-mother some of her old\nmisgiving returning, \"that I am coming back only on condition of his\nleaving as he promised?  Will you let him know this, that there may be\nno mistake?\"\n\nMrs. Melbury, who had some long private talks with Fitzpiers, assured\nGrace that she need have no doubts on that point, and that he would\nprobably be gone by the evening.  Grace then entered with them into\nMelbury's wing of the house, and sat down listlessly in the parlor,\nwhile her step-mother went to Fitzpiers.\n\nThe prompt obedience to her wishes which the surgeon showed did honor\nto him, if anything could.  Before Mrs. Melbury had returned to the\nroom Grace, who was sitting on the parlor window-bench, saw her husband\ngo from the door under the increasing light of morning, with a bag in\nhis hand.  While passing through the gate he turned his head.  The\nfirelight of the room she sat in threw her figure into dark relief\nagainst the window as she looked through the panes, and he must have\nseen her distinctly.  In a moment he went on, the gate fell to, and he\ndisappeared.  At the hut she had declared that another had displaced\nhim; and now she had banished him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV.\n\nFitzpiers had hardly been gone an hour when Grace began to sicken. The\nnext day she kept her room.  Old Jones was called in; he murmured some\nstatements in which the words \"feverish symptoms\" occurred.  Grace\nheard them, and guessed the means by which she had brought this\nvisitation upon herself.\n\nOne day, while she still lay there with her head throbbing, wondering\nif she were really going to join him who had gone before, Grammer\nOliver came to her bedside.  \"I don't know whe'r this is meant for you\nto take, ma'am,\" she said, \"but I have found it on the table.  It was\nleft by Marty, I think, when she came this morning.\"\n\nGrace turned her hot eyes upon what Grammer held up.  It was the phial\nleft at the hut by her husband when he had begged her to take some\ndrops of its contents if she wished to preserve herself from falling a\nvictim to the malady which had pulled down Winterborne.  She examined\nit as well as she could.  The liquid was of an opaline hue, and bore a\nlabel with an inscription in Italian.  He had probably got it in his\nwanderings abroad.  She knew but little Italian, but could understand\nthat the cordial was a febrifuge of some sort.  Her father, her mother,\nand all the household were anxious for her recovery, and she resolved\nto obey her husband's directions.  Whatever the risk, if any, she was\nprepared to run it.  A glass of water was brought, and the drops\ndropped in.\n\nThe effect, though not miraculous, was remarkable.  In less than an\nhour she felt calmer, cooler, better able to reflect--less inclined to\nfret and chafe and wear herself away.  She took a few drops more.  From\nthat time the fever retreated, and went out like a damped conflagration.\n\n\"How clever he is!\" she said, regretfully.  \"Why could he not have had\nmore principle, so as to turn his great talents to good account?\nPerhaps he has saved my useless life.  But he doesn't know it, and\ndoesn't care whether he has saved it or not; and on that account will\nnever be told by me! Probably he only gave it to me in the arrogance of\nhis skill, to show the greatness of his resources beside mine, as\nElijah drew down fire from heaven.\"\n\nAs soon as she had quite recovered from this foiled attack upon her\nlife, Grace went to Marty South's cottage.  The current of her being\nhad again set towards the lost Giles Winterborne.\n\n\"Marty,\" she said, \"we both loved him.  We will go to his grave\ntogether.\"\n\nGreat Hintock church stood at the upper part of the village, and could\nbe reached without passing through the street.  In the dusk of the late\nSeptember day they went thither by secret ways, walking mostly in\nsilence side by side, each busied with her own thoughts.  Grace had a\ntrouble exceeding Marty's--that haunting sense of having put out the\nlight of his life by her own hasty doings.  She had tried to persuade\nherself that he might have died of his illness, even if she had not\ntaken possession of his house. Sometimes she succeeded in her attempt;\nsometimes she did not.\n\nThey stood by the grave together, and though the sun had gone down,\nthey could see over the woodland for miles, and down to the vale in\nwhich he had been accustomed to descend every year, with his portable\nmill and press, to make cider about this time.\n\nPerhaps Grace's first grief, the discovery that if he had lived he\ncould never have claimed her, had some power in softening this, the\nsecond.  On Marty's part there was the same consideration; never would\nshe have been his.  As no anticipation of gratified affection had been\nin existence while he was with them, there was none to be disappointed\nnow that he had gone.\n\nGrace was abased when, by degrees, she found that she had never\nunderstood Giles as Marty had done.  Marty South alone, of all the\nwomen in Hintock and the world, had approximated to Winterborne's level\nof intelligent intercourse with nature.  In that respect she had formed\nthe complement to him in the other sex, had lived as his counterpart,\nhad subjoined her thought to his as a corollary.\n\nThe casual glimpses which the ordinary population bestowed upon that\nwondrous world of sap and leaves called the Hintock woods had been with\nthese two, Giles and Marty, a clear gaze.  They had been possessed of\nits finer mysteries as of commonplace knowledge; had been able to read\nits hieroglyphs as ordinary writing; to them the sights and sounds of\nnight, winter, wind, storm, amid those dense boughs, which had to Grace\na touch of the uncanny, and even the supernatural, were simple\noccurrences whose origin, continuance, and laws they foreknew.  They\nhad planted together, and together they had felled; together they had,\nwith the run of the years, mentally collected those remoter signs and\nsymbols which, seen in few, were of runic obscurity, but all together\nmade an alphabet. From the light lashing of the twigs upon their faces,\nwhen brushing through them in the dark, they could pronounce upon the\nspecies of the tree whence they stretched; from the quality of the\nwind's murmur through a bough they could in like manner name its sort\nafar off.  They knew by a glance at a trunk if its heart were sound, or\ntainted with incipient decay, and by the state of its upper twigs, the\nstratum that had been reached by its roots.  The artifices of the\nseasons were seen by them from the conjuror's own point of view, and\nnot from that of the spectator's.\n\n\"He ought to have married YOU, Marty, and nobody else in the world!\"\nsaid Grace, with conviction, after thinking somewhat in the above\nstrain.\n\nMarty shook her head.  \"In all our out-door days and years together,\nma'am,\" she replied, \"the one thing he never spoke of to me was love;\nnor I to him.\"\n\n\"Yet you and he could speak in a tongue that nobody else knew--not even\nmy father, though he came nearest knowing--the tongue of the trees and\nfruits and flowers themselves.\"\n\nShe could indulge in mournful fancies like this to Marty; but the hard\ncore to her grief--which Marty's had not--remained.  Had she been sure\nthat Giles's death resulted entirely from his exposure, it would have\ndriven her well-nigh to insanity; but there was always that bare\npossibility that his exposure had only precipitated what was\ninevitable.  She longed to believe that it had not done even this.\n\nThere was only one man whose opinion on the circumstances she would be\nat all disposed to trust.  Her husband was that man.  Yet to ask him it\nwould be necessary to detail the true conditions in which she and\nWinterborne had lived during these three or four critical days that\nfollowed her flight; and in withdrawing her original defiant\nannouncement on that point, there seemed a weakness she did not care to\nshow.  She never doubted that Fitzpiers would believe her if she made a\nclean confession of the actual situation; but to volunteer the\ncorrection would seem like signalling for a truce, and that, in her\npresent frame of mind, was what she did not feel the need of.\n\n\nIt will probably not appear a surprising statement, after what has been\nalready declared of Fitzpiers, that the man whom Grace's fidelity could\nnot keep faithful was stung into passionate throbs of interest\nconcerning her by her avowal of the contrary.\n\nHe declared to himself that he had never known her dangerously full\ncompass if she were capable of such a reprisal; and, melancholy as it\nmay be to admit the fact, his own humiliation and regret engendered a\nsmouldering admiration of her.\n\nHe passed a month or two of great misery at Exbury, the place to which\nhe had retired--quite as much misery indeed as Grace, could she have\nknown of it, would have been inclined to inflict upon any living\ncreature, how much soever he might have wronged her.  Then a sudden\nhope dawned upon him; he wondered if her affirmation were true.  He\nasked himself whether it were not the act of a woman whose natural\npurity and innocence had blinded her to the contingencies of such an\nannouncement.  His wide experience of the sex had taught him that, in\nmany cases, women who ventured on hazardous matters did so because they\nlacked an imagination sensuous enough to feel their full force.  In\nthis light Grace's bold avowal might merely have denoted the\ndesperation of one who was a child to the realities of obliquity.\n\nFitzpiers's mental sufferings and suspense led him at last to take a\nmelancholy journey to the neighborhood of Little Hintock; and here he\nhovered for hours around the scene of the purest emotional experiences\nthat he had ever known in his life.  He walked about the woods that\nsurrounded Melbury's house, keeping out of sight like a criminal.  It\nwas a fine evening, and on his way homeward he passed near Marty\nSouth's cottage.  As usual she had lighted her candle without closing\nher shutters; he saw her within as he had seen her many times before.\n\nShe was polishing tools, and though he had not wished to show himself,\nhe could not resist speaking in to her through the half-open door.\n\"What are you doing that for, Marty?\"\n\n\"Because I want to clean them.  They are not mine.\" He could see,\nindeed, that they were not hers, for one was a spade, large and heavy,\nand another was a bill-hook which she could only have used with both\nhands.  The spade, though not a new one, had been so completely\nburnished that it was bright as silver.\n\nFitzpiers somehow divined that they were Giles Winterborne's, and he\nput the question to her.\n\nShe replied in the affirmative.  \"I am going to keep 'em,\" she said,\n\"but I can't get his apple-mill and press.  I wish could; it is going\nto be sold, they say.\"\n\n\"Then I will buy it for you,\" said Fitzpiers.  \"That will be making you\na return for a kindness you did me.\"  His glance fell upon the girl's\nrare-colored hair, which had grown again.  \"Oh, Marty, those locks of\nyours--and that letter! But it was a kindness to send it,\nnevertheless,\" he added, musingly.\n\nAfter this there was confidence between them--such confidence as there\nhad never been before.  Marty was shy, indeed, of speaking about the\nletter, and her motives in writing it; but she thanked him warmly for\nhis promise of the cider-press.  She would travel with it in the autumn\nseason, as he had done, she said.  She would be quite strong enough,\nwith old Creedle as an assistant.\n\n\"Ah! there was one nearer to him than you,\" said Fitzpiers, referring\nto Winterborne.  \"One who lived where he lived, and was with him when\nhe died.\"\n\nThen Marty, suspecting that he did not know the true circumstances,\nfrom the fact that Mrs. Fitzpiers and himself were living apart, told\nhim of Giles's generosity to Grace in giving up his house to her at the\nrisk, and possibly the sacrifice, of his own life.  When the surgeon\nheard it he almost envied Giles his chivalrous character.  He expressed\na wish to Marty that his visit to her should be kept secret, and went\nhome thoughtful, feeling that in more that one sense his journey to\nHintock had not been in vain.\n\nHe would have given much to win Grace's forgiveness then.  But whatever\nhe dared hope for in that kind from the future, there was nothing to be\ndone yet, while Giles Winterborne's memory was green.  To wait was\nimperative.  A little time might melt her frozen thoughts, and lead her\nto look on him with toleration, if not with love.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV.\n\nWeeks and months of mourning for Winterborne had been passed by Grace\nin the soothing monotony of the memorial act to which she and Marty had\ndevoted themselves.  Twice a week the pair went in the dusk to Great\nHintock, and, like the two mourners in Cymbeline, sweetened his sad\ngrave with their flowers and their tears.  Sometimes Grace thought that\nit was a pity neither one of them had been his wife for a little while,\nand given the world a copy of him who was so valuable in their eyes.\nNothing ever had brought home to her with such force as this death how\nlittle acquirements and culture weigh beside sterling personal\ncharacter. While her simple sorrow for his loss took a softer edge with\nthe lapse of the autumn and winter seasons, her self-reproach at having\nhad a possible hand in causing it knew little abatement.\n\nLittle occurred at Hintock during these months of the fall and decay of\nthe leaf.  Discussion of the almost contemporaneous death of Mrs.\nCharmond abroad had waxed and waned.  Fitzpiers had had a marvellous\nescape from being dragged into the inquiry which followed it, through\nthe accident of their having parted just before under the influence of\nMarty South's letter--the tiny instrument of a cause deep in nature.\n\nHer body was not brought home.  It seemed to accord well with the\nfitful fever of that impassioned woman's life that she should not have\nfound a native grave.  She had enjoyed but a life-interest in the\nestate, which, after her death, passed to a relative of her\nhusband's--one who knew not Felice, one whose purpose seemed to be to\nblot out every vestige of her.\n\nOn a certain day in February--the cheerful day of St. Valentine, in\nfact--a letter reached Mrs. Fitzpiers, which had been mentally promised\nher for that particular day a long time before.\n\nIt announced that Fitzpiers was living at some midland town, where he\nhad obtained a temporary practice as assistant to some local medical\nman, whose curative principles were all wrong, though he dared not set\nthem right.  He had thought fit to communicate with her on that day of\ntender traditions to inquire if, in the event of his obtaining a\nsubstantial practice that he had in view elsewhere, she could forget\nthe past and bring herself to join him.\n\nThere the practical part ended; he then went on--\n\n\n\"My last year of experience has added ten years to my age, dear Grace\nand dearest wife that ever erring man undervalued.  You may be\nabsolutely indifferent to what I say, but let me say it: I have never\nloved any woman alive or dead as I love, respect, and honor you at this\npresent moment.  What you told me in the pride and haughtiness of your\nheart I never believed [this, by the way, was not strictly true]; but\neven if I had believed it, it could never have estranged me from you.\nIs there any use in telling you--no, there is not--that I dream of your\nripe lips more frequently than I say my prayers; that the old familiar\nrustle of your dress often returns upon my mind till it distracts me?\nIf you could condescend even only to see me again you would be\nbreathing life into a corpse.  My pure, pure Grace, modest as a\nturtledove, how came I ever to possess you? For the sake of being\npresent in your mind on this lovers' day, I think I would almost rather\nhave you hate me a little than not think of me at all.  You may call my\nfancies whimsical; but remember, sweet, lost one, that 'nature is one\nin love, and where 'tis fine it sends some instance of itself.'  I will\nnot intrude upon you further now.  Make me a little bit happy by\nsending back one line to say that you will consent, at any rate, to a\nshort interview.  I will meet you and leave you as a mere acquaintance,\nif you will only afford me this slight means of making a few\nexplanations, and of putting my position before you. Believe me, in\nspite of all you may do or feel,\n\nYour lover always (once your husband),\n\n                                               \"E.\"\n\n\nIt was, oddly enough, the first occasion, or nearly the first on which\nGrace had ever received a love-letter from him, his courtship having\ntaken place under conditions which rendered letter-writing unnecessary.\nIts perusal, therefore, had a certain novelty for her.  She thought\nthat, upon the whole, he wrote love-letters very well.  But the chief\nrational interest of the letter to the reflective Grace lay in the\nchance that such a meeting as he proposed would afford her of setting\nher doubts at rest, one way or the other, on her actual share in\nWinterborne's death.  The relief of consulting a skilled mind, the one\nprofessional man who had seen Giles at that time, would be immense.  As\nfor that statement that she had uttered in her disdainful grief, which\nat the time she had regarded as her triumph, she was quite prepared to\nadmit to him that his belief was the true one; for in wronging herself\nas she did when she made it, she had done what to her was a far more\nserious thing, wronged Winterborne's memory.\n\nWithout consulting her father, or any one in the house or out of it,\nGrace replied to the letter.  She agreed to meet Fitzpiers on two\nconditions, of which the first was that the place of meeting should be\nthe top of Rubdown Hill, the second that he would not object to Marty\nSouth accompanying her.\n\nWhatever part, much or little, there may have been in Fitzpiers's\nso-called valentine to his wife, he felt a delight as of the bursting\nof spring when her brief reply came.  It was one of the few pleasures\nthat he had experienced of late years at all resembling those of his\nearly youth.  He promptly replied that he accepted the conditions, and\nnamed the day and hour at which he would be on the spot she mentioned.\n\nA few minutes before three on the appointed day found him climbing the\nwell-known hill, which had been the axis of so many critical movements\nin their lives during his residence at Hintock.\n\nThe sight of each homely and well-remembered object swelled the regret\nthat seldom left him now.  Whatever paths might lie open to his future,\nthe soothing shades of Hintock were forbidden him forever as a\npermanent dwelling-place.\n\nHe longed for the society of Grace.  But to lay offerings on her\nslighted altar was his first aim, and until her propitiation was\ncomplete he would constrain her in no way to return to him.  The least\nreparation that he could make, in a case where he would gladly have\nmade much, would be to let her feel herself absolutely free to choose\nbetween living with him and without him.\n\nMoreover, a subtlist in emotions, he cultivated as under glasses\nstrange and mournful pleasures that he would not willingly let die just\nat present.  To show any forwardness in suggesting a modus vivendi to\nGrace would be to put an end to these exotics.  To be the vassal of her\nsweet will for a time, he demanded no more, and found solace in the\ncontemplation of the soft miseries she caused him.\n\nApproaching the hill-top with a mind strung to these notions, Fitzpiers\ndiscerned a gay procession of people coming over the crest, and was not\nlong in perceiving it to be a wedding-party.\n\nThough the wind was keen the women were in light attire, and the\nflowered waistcoats of the men had a pleasing vividness of pattern.\nEach of the gentler ones clung to the arm of her partner so tightly as\nto have with him one step, rise, swing, gait, almost one centre of\ngravity.  In the buxom bride Fitzpiers recognized no other than Suke\nDamson, who in her light gown looked a giantess; the small husband\nbeside her he saw to be Tim Tangs.\n\nFitzpiers could not escape, for they had seen him; though of all the\nbeauties of the world whom he did not wish to meet Suke was the chief.\nBut he put the best face on the matter that he could and came on, the\napproaching company evidently discussing him and his separation from\nMrs. Fitzpiers.  As the couples closed upon him he expressed his\ncongratulations.\n\n\"We be just walking round the parishes to show ourselves a bit,\" said\nTim.  \"First we het across to Delborough, then athwart to here, and\nfrom here we go to Rubdown and Millshot, and then round by the\ncross-roads home.  Home says I, but it won't be that long! We be off\nnext month.\"\n\n\"Indeed.  Where to?\"\n\nTim informed him that they were going to New Zealand.  Not but that he\nwould have been contented with Hintock, but his wife was ambitious and\nwanted to leave, so he had given way.\n\n\"Then good-by,\" said Fitzpiers; \"I may not see you again.\" He shook\nhands with Tim and turned to the bride.  \"Good-by, Suke,\" he said,\ntaking her hand also.  \"I wish you and your husband prosperity in the\ncountry you have chosen.\"  With this he left them, and hastened on to\nhis appointment.\n\nThe wedding-party re-formed and resumed march likewise.  But in\nrestoring his arm to Suke, Tim noticed that her full and blooming\ncountenance had undergone a change.  \"Holloa! me dear--what's the\nmatter?\" said Tim.\n\n\"Nothing to speak o',\" said she.  But to give the lie to her assertion\nshe was seized with lachrymose twitches, that soon produced a dribbling\nface.\n\n\"How--what the devil's this about!\" exclaimed the bridegroom.\n\n\"She's a little wee bit overcome, poor dear!\" said the first\nbridesmaid, unfolding her handkerchief and wiping Suke's eyes.\n\n\"I never did like parting from people!\" said Suke, as soon as she could\nspeak.\n\n\"Why him in particular?\"\n\n\"Well--he's such a clever doctor, that 'tis a thousand pities we\nsha'n't see him any more! There'll be no such clever doctor as he in\nNew Zealand, if I should require one; and the thought o't got the\nbetter of my feelings!\"\n\nThey walked on, but Tim's face had grown rigid and pale, for he\nrecalled slight circumstances, disregarded at the time of their\noccurrence.  The former boisterous laughter of the wedding-party at the\ngroomsman's jokes was heard ringing through the woods no more.\n\nBy this time Fitzpiers had advanced on his way to the top of the hill,\nwhere he saw two figures emerging from the bank on the right hand.\nThese were the expected ones, Grace and Marty South, who had evidently\ncome there by a short and secret path through the wood.  Grace was\nmuffled up in her winter dress, and he thought that she had never\nlooked so seductive as at this moment, in the noontide bright but\nheatless sun, and the keen wind, and the purplish-gray masses of\nbrushwood around.\n\nFitzpiers continued to regard the nearing picture, till at length their\nglances met for a moment, when she demurely sent off hers at a tangent\nand gave him the benefit of her three-quarter face, while with\ncourteous completeness of conduct he lifted his hat in a large arc.\nMarty dropped behind; and when Fitzpiers held out his hand, Grace\ntouched it with her fingers.\n\n\"I have agreed to be here mostly because I wanted to ask you something\nimportant,\" said Mrs. Fitzpiers, her intonation modulating in a\ndirection that she had not quite wished it to take.\n\n\"I am most attentive,\" said her husband.  \"Shall we take to the wood\nfor privacy?\"\n\nGrace demurred, and Fitzpiers gave in, and they kept the public road.\n\nAt any rate she would take his arm?  This also was gravely negatived,\nthe refusal being audible to Marty.\n\n\"Why not?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Fitzpiers--how can you ask?\"\n\n\"Right, right,\" said he, his effusiveness shrivelled up.\n\nAs they walked on she returned to her inquiry.  \"It is about a matter\nthat may perhaps be unpleasant to you.  But I think I need not consider\nthat too carefully.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" said Fitzpiers, heroically.\n\nShe then took him back to the time of poor Winterborne's death, and\nrelated the precise circumstances amid which his fatal illness had come\nupon him, particularizing the dampness of the shelter to which he had\nbetaken himself, his concealment from her of the hardships that he was\nundergoing, all that he had put up with, all that he had done for her\nin his scrupulous considerateness.  The retrospect brought her to tears\nas she asked him if he thought that the sin of having driven him to his\ndeath was upon her.\n\nFitzpiers could hardly help showing his satisfaction at what her\nnarrative indirectly revealed, the actual harmlessness of an escapade\nwith her lover, which had at first, by her own showing, looked so\ngrave, and he did not care to inquire whether that harmlessness had\nbeen the result of aim or of accident.  With regard to her question, he\ndeclared that in his judgment no human being could answer it.  He\nthought that upon the whole the balance of probabilities turned in her\nfavor.  Winterborne's apparent strength, during the last months of his\nlife, must have been delusive.  It had often occurred that after a\nfirst attack of that insidious disease a person's apparent recovery was\na physiological mendacity.\n\nThe relief which came to Grace lay almost as much in sharing her\nknowledge of the particulars with an intelligent mind as in the\nassurances Fitzpiers gave her.  \"Well, then, to put this case before\nyou, and obtain your professional opinion, was chiefly why I consented\nto come here to-day,\" said she, when he had reached the aforesaid\nconclusion.\n\n\"For no other reason at all?\" he asked, ruefully.\n\n\"It was nearly the whole.\"\n\nThey stood and looked over a gate at twenty or thirty starlings feeding\nin the grass, and he started the talk again by saying, in a low voice,\n\"And yet I love you more than ever I loved you in my life.\"\n\nGrace did not move her eyes from the birds, and folded her delicate\nlips as if to keep them in subjection.\n\n\"It is a different kind of love altogether,\" said he.  \"Less\npassionate; more profound.  It has nothing to do with the material\nconditions of the object at all; much to do with her character and\ngoodness, as revealed by closer observation.  'Love talks with better\nknowledge, and knowledge with dearer love.'\"\n\n\"That's out of 'Measure for Measure,'\" said she, slyly.\n\n\"Oh yes--I meant it as a citation,\" blandly replied Fitzpiers. \"Well,\nthen, why not give me a very little bit of your heart again?\"\n\nThe crash of a felled tree in the remote depths of the wood recalled\nthe past at that moment, and all the homely faithfulness of\nWinterborne.  \"Don't ask it! My heart is in the grave with Giles,\" she\nreplied, stanchly.\n\n\"Mine is with you--in no less deep a grave, I fear, according to that.\"\n\n\"I am very sorry; but it cannot be helped.\"\n\n\"How can you be sorry for me, when you wilfully keep open the grave?\"\n\n\"Oh no--that's not so,\" returned Grace, quickly, and moved to go away\nfrom him.\n\n\"But, dearest Grace,\" said he, \"you have condescended to come; and I\nthought from it that perhaps when I had passed through a long state of\nprobation you would be generous.  But if there can be no hope of our\ngetting completely reconciled, treat me gently--wretch though I am.\"\n\n\"I did not say you were a wretch, nor have I ever said so.\"\n\n\"But you have such a contemptuous way of looking at me that I fear you\nthink so.\"\n\nGrace's heart struggled between the wish not to be harsh and the fear\nthat she might mislead him.  \"I cannot look contemptuous unless I feel\ncontempt,\" she said, evasively.  \"And all I feel is lovelessness.\"\n\n\"I have been very bad, I know,\" he returned.  \"But unless you can\nreally love me again, Grace, I would rather go away from you forever.\nI don't want you to receive me again for duty's sake, or anything of\nthat sort.  If I had not cared more for your affection and forgiveness\nthan my own personal comfort, I should never have come back here.  I\ncould have obtained a practice at a distance, and have lived my own\nlife without coldness or reproach.  But I have chosen to return to the\none spot on earth where my name is tarnished--to enter the house of a\nman from whom I have had worse treatment than from any other man\nalive--all for you!\"\n\nThis was undeniably true, and it had its weight with Grace, who began\nto look as if she thought she had been shockingly severe.\n\n\"Before you go,\" he continued, \"I want to know your pleasure about\nme--what you wish me to do, or not to do.\"\n\n\"You are independent of me, and it seems a mockery to ask that. Far be\nit from me to advise.  But I will think it over.  I rather need advice\nmyself than stand in a position to give it.\"\n\n\"YOU don't need advice, wisest, dearest woman that ever lived.  If you\ndid--\"\n\n\"Would you give it to me?\"\n\n\"Would you act upon what I gave?\"\n\n\"That's not a fair inquiry,\" said she, smiling despite her gravity.  \"I\ndon't mind hearing it--what you do really think the most correct and\nproper course for me.\"\n\n\"It is so easy for me to say, and yet I dare not, for it would be\nprovoking you to remonstrances.\"\n\nKnowing, of course, what the advice would be, she did not press him\nfurther, and was about to beckon Marty forward and leave him, when he\ninterrupted her with, \"Oh, one moment, dear Grace--you will meet me\nagain?\"\n\nShe eventually agreed to see him that day fortnight.  Fitzpiers\nexpostulated at the interval, but the half-alarmed earnestness with\nwhich she entreated him not to come sooner made him say hastily that he\nsubmitted to her will--that he would regard her as a friend only,\nanxious for his reform and well-being, till such time as she might\nallow him to exceed that privilege.\n\nAll this was to assure her; it was only too clear that he had not won\nher confidence yet.  It amazed Fitzpiers, and overthrew all his\ndeductions from previous experience, to find that this girl, though she\nhad been married to him, could yet be so coy. Notwithstanding a certain\nfascination that it carried with it, his reflections were sombre as he\nwent homeward; he saw how deep had been his offence to produce so great\na wariness in a gentle and once unsuspicious soul.\n\nHe was himself too fastidious to care to coerce her.  To be an object\nof misgiving or dislike to a woman who shared his home was what he\ncould not endure the thought of.  Life as it stood was more tolerable.\n\nWhen he was gone, Marty joined Mrs. Fitzpiers.  She would fain have\nconsulted Marty on the question of Platonic relations with her former\nhusband, as she preferred to regard him.  But Marty showed no great\ninterest in their affairs, so Grace said nothing. They came onward, and\nsaw Melbury standing at the scene of the felling which had been audible\nto them, when, telling Marty that she wished her meeting with Mr.\nFitzpiers to be kept private, she left the girl to join her father.  At\nany rate, she would consult him on the expediency of occasionally\nseeing her husband.\n\nHer father was cheerful, and walked by her side as he had done in\nearlier days.  \"I was thinking of you when you came up,\" he said. \"I\nhave considered that what has happened is for the best.  Since your\nhusband is gone away, and seems not to wish to trouble you, why, let\nhim go, and drop out of your life.  Many women are worse off.  You can\nlive here comfortably enough, and he can emigrate, or do what he likes\nfor his good.  I wouldn't mind sending him the further sum of money he\nmight naturally expect to come to him, so that you may not be bothered\nwith him any more.  He could hardly have gone on living here without\nspeaking to me, or meeting me; and that would have been very unpleasant\non both sides.\"\n\nThese remarks checked her intention.  There was a sense of weakness in\nfollowing them by saying that she had just met her husband by\nappointment.  \"Then you would advise me not to communicate with him?\"\nshe observed.\n\n\"I shall never advise ye again.  You are your own mistress--do as you\nlike.  But my opinion is that if you don't live with him, you had\nbetter live without him, and not go shilly-shallying and playing\nbopeep.  You sent him away; and now he's gone.  Very well; trouble him\nno more.\"\n\nGrace felt a guiltiness--she hardly knew why--and made no confession.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVI.\n\nThe woods were uninteresting, and Grace stayed in-doors a great deal.\nShe became quite a student, reading more than she had done since her\nmarriage But her seclusion was always broken for the periodical visit\nto Winterborne's grave with Marty, which was kept up with pious\nstrictness, for the purpose of putting snow-drops, primroses, and other\nvernal flowers thereon as they came.\n\nOne afternoon at sunset she was standing just outside her father's\ngarden, which, like the rest of the Hintock enclosures, abutted into\nthe wood.  A slight foot-path led along here, forming a secret way to\neither of the houses by getting through its boundary hedge.  Grace was\njust about to adopt this mode of entry when a figure approached along\nthe path, and held up his hand to detain her.  It was her husband.\n\n\"I am delighted,\" he said, coming up out of breath; and there seemed no\nreason to doubt his words.  \"I saw you some way off--I was afraid you\nwould go in before I could reach you.\"\n\n\"It is a week before the time,\" said she, reproachfully.  \"I said a\nfortnight from the last meeting.\"\n\n\"My dear, you don't suppose I could wait a fortnight without trying to\nget a glimpse of you, even though you had declined to meet me! Would it\nmake you angry to know that I have been along this path at dusk three\nor four times since our last meeting? Well, how are you?\"\n\nShe did not refuse her hand, but when he showed a wish to retain it a\nmoment longer than mere formality required, she made it smaller, so\nthat it slipped away from him, with again that same alarmed look which\nalways followed his attempts in this direction. He saw that she was not\nyet out of the elusive mood; not yet to be treated presumingly; and he\nwas correspondingly careful to tranquillize her.\n\nHis assertion had seemed to impress her somewhat.  \"I had no idea you\ncame so often,\" she said.  \"How far do you come from?\"\n\n\"From Exbury.  I always walk from Sherton-Abbas, for if I hire, people\nwill know that I come; and my success with you so far has not been\ngreat enough to justify such overtness.  Now, my dear one--as I MUST\ncall you--I put it to you: will you see me a little oftener as the\nspring advances?\"\n\nGrace lapsed into unwonted sedateness, and avoiding the question, said,\n\"I wish you would concentrate on your profession, and give up those\nstrange studies that used to distract you so much.  I am sure you would\nget on.\"\n\n\"It is the very thing I am doing.  I was going to ask you to burn--or,\nat least, get rid of--all my philosophical literature.  It is in the\nbookcases in your rooms.  The fact is, I never cared much for abstruse\nstudies.\"\n\n\"I am so glad to hear you say that.  And those other books--those piles\nof old plays--what good are they to a medical man?\"\n\n\"None whatever!\" he replied, cheerfully.  \"Sell them at Sherton for\nwhat they will fetch.\"\n\n\"And those dreadful old French romances, with their horrid spellings of\n'filz' and 'ung' and 'ilz' and 'mary' and 'ma foy?'\"\n\n\"You haven't been reading them, Grace?\"\n\n\"Oh no--I just looked into them, that was all.\"\n\n\"Make a bonfire of 'em directly you get home.  I meant to do it myself.\nI can't think what possessed me ever to collect them.  I have only a\nfew professional hand-books now, and am quite a practical man.  I am in\nhopes of having some good news to tell you soon, and then do you think\nyou could--come to me again?\"\n\n\"I would rather you did not press me on that just now,\" she replied,\nwith some feeling.  \"You have said you mean to lead a new, useful,\neffectual life; but I should like to see you put it in practice for a\nlittle while before you address that query to me.  Besides--I could not\nlive with you.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\nGrace was silent a few instants.  \"I go with Marty to Giles's grave.\nWe swore we would show him that devotion.  And I mean to keep it up.\"\n\n\"Well, I wouldn't mind that at all.  I have no right to expect anything\nelse, and I will not wish you to keep away.  I liked the man as well as\nany I ever knew.  In short, I would accompany you a part of the way to\nthe place, and smoke a cigar on the stile while I waited till you came\nback.\"\n\n\"Then you haven't given up smoking?\"\n\n\"Well--ahem--no.  I have thought of doing so, but--\"\n\nHis extreme complacence had rather disconcerted Grace, and the question\nabout smoking had been to effect a diversion.  Presently she said,\nfirmly, and with a moisture in her eye that he could not see, as her\nmind returned to poor Giles's \"frustrate ghost,\"  \"I don't like you--to\nspeak lightly on that subject, if you did speak lightly.  To be frank\nwith you--quite frank--I think of him as my betrothed lover still.  I\ncannot help it.  So that it would be wrong for me to join you.\"\n\nFitzpiers was now uneasy.  \"You say your betrothed lover still,\" he\nrejoined.  \"When, then, were you betrothed to him, or engaged, as we\ncommon people say?\"\n\n\"When you were away.\"\n\n\"How could that be?\"\n\nGrace would have avoided this; but her natural candor led her on. \"It\nwas when I was under the impression that my marriage with you was about\nto be annulled, and that he could then marry me.  So I encouraged him\nto love me.\"\n\nFitzpiers winced visibly; and yet, upon the whole, she was right in\ntelling it.  Indeed, his perception that she was right in her absolute\nsincerity kept up his affectionate admiration for her under the pain of\nthe rebuff.  Time had been when the avowal that Grace had deliberately\ntaken steps to replace him would have brought him no sorrow.  But she\nso far dominated him now that he could not bear to hear her words,\nalthough the object of her high regard was no more.\n\n\"It is rough upon me--that!\" he said, bitterly.  \"Oh, Grace--I did not\nknow you--tried to get rid of me!  I suppose it is of no use, but I\nask, cannot you hope to--find a little love in your heart for me again?\"\n\n\"If I could I would oblige you; but I fear I cannot!\" she replied, with\nillogical ruefulness.  \"And I don't see why you should mind my having\nhad one lover besides yourself in my life, when you have had so many.\"\n\n\"But I can tell you honestly that I love you better than all of them\nput together, and that's what you will not tell me!\"\n\n\"I am sorry; but I fear I cannot,\" she said, sighing again.\n\n\"I wonder if you ever will?\" He looked musingly into her indistinct\nface, as if he would read the future there.  \"Now have pity, and tell\nme: will you try?\"\n\n\"To love you again?\"\n\n\"Yes; if you can.\"\n\n\"I don't know how to reply,\" she answered, her embarrassment proving\nher truth.  \"Will you promise to leave me quite free as to seeing you\nor not seeing you?\"\n\n\"Certainly.  Have I given any ground for you to doubt my first promise\nin that respect?\"\n\nShe was obliged to admit that he had not.\n\n\"Then I think that you might get your heart out of that grave,\" said\nhe, with playful sadness.  \"It has been there a long time.\"\n\nShe faintly shook her head, but said, \"I'll try to think of you\nmore--if I can.\"\n\nWith this Fitzpiers was compelled to be satisfied, and he asked her\nwhen she would meet him again.\n\n\"As we arranged--in a fortnight.\"\n\n\"If it must be a fortnight it must!\"\n\n\"This time at least.  I'll consider by the day I see you again if I can\nshorten the interval.\"\n\n\"Well, be that as it may, I shall come at least twice a week to look at\nyour window.\"\n\n\"You must do as you like about that.  Good-night.\"\n\n\"Say 'husband.'\"\n\nShe seemed almost inclined to give him the word; but exclaiming, \"No,\nno; I cannot,\" slipped through the garden-hedge and disappeared.\n\n\nFitzpiers did not exaggerate when he told her that he should haunt the\nprecincts of the dwelling.  But his persistence in this course did not\nresult in his seeing her much oftener than at the fortnightly interval\nwhich she had herself marked out as proper. At these times, however,\nshe punctually appeared, and as the spring wore on the meetings were\nkept up, though their character changed but little with the increase in\ntheir number.\n\nThe small garden of the cottage occupied by the Tangs family--father,\nson, and now son's wife--aligned with the larger one of the\ntimber-dealer at its upper end; and when young Tim, after leaving work\nat Melbury's, stood at dusk in the little bower at the corner of his\nenclosure to smoke a pipe, he frequently observed the surgeon pass\nalong the outside track before-mentioned.  Fitzpiers always walked\nloiteringly, pensively, looking with a sharp eye into the gardens one\nafter another as he proceeded; for Fitzpiers did not wish to leave the\nnow absorbing spot too quickly, after travelling so far to reach it;\nhoping always for a glimpse of her whom he passionately desired to take\nto his arms anew.\n\nNow Tim began to be struck with these loitering progresses along the\ngarden boundaries in the gloaming, and wondered what they boded.  It\nwas, naturally, quite out of his power to divine the singular,\nsentimental revival in Fitzpiers's heart; the fineness of tissue which\ncould take a deep, emotional--almost also an artistic--pleasure in\nbeing the yearning inamorato of a woman he once had deserted, would\nhave seemed an absurdity to the young sawyer.  Mr. and Mrs. Fitzpiers\nwere separated; therefore the question of affection as between them was\nsettled.  But his Suke had, since that meeting on their marriage-day,\nrepentantly admitted, to the urgency of his questioning, a good deal\nconcerning her past levities.  Putting all things together, he could\nhardly avoid connecting Fitzpiers's mysterious visits to this spot with\nSuke's residence under his roof.  But he made himself fairly easy: the\nvessel in which they were about to emigrate sailed that month; and then\nSuke would be out of Fitzpiers's way forever.\n\nThe interval at last expired, and the eve of their departure arrived.\nThey were pausing in the room of the cottage allotted to them by Tim's\nfather, after a busy day of preparation, which left them weary.  In a\ncorner stood their boxes, crammed and corded, their large case for the\nhold having already been sent away.  The firelight shone upon Suke's\nfine face and form as she stood looking into it, and upon the face of\nTim seated in a corner, and upon the walls of his father's house, which\nhe was beholding that night almost for the last time.\n\nTim Tangs was not happy.  This scheme of emigration was dividing him\nfrom his father--for old Tangs would on no account leave Hintock--and\nhad it not been for Suke's reputation and his own dignity, Tim would at\nthe last moment have abandoned the project. As he sat in the back part\nof the room he regarded her moodily, and the fire and the boxes.  One\nthing he had particularly noticed this evening--she was very restless;\nfitful in her actions, unable to remain seated, and in a marked degree\ndepressed.\n\n\"Sorry that you be going, after all, Suke?\" he said.\n\nShe sighed involuntarily.  \"I don't know but that I be,\" she answered.\n\"'Tis natural, isn't it, when one is going away?\"\n\n\"But you wasn't born here as I was.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"There's folk left behind that you'd fain have with 'ee, I reckon?\"\n\n\"Why do you think that?\"\n\n\"I've seen things and I've heard things; and, Suke, I say 'twill be a\ngood move for me to get 'ee away.  I don't mind his leavings abroad,\nbut I do mind 'em at home.\"\n\nSuke's face was not changed from its aspect of listless indifference by\nthe words.  She answered nothing; and shortly after he went out for his\ncustomary pipe of tobacco at the top of the garden.\n\nThe restlessness of Suke had indeed owed its presence to the gentleman\nof Tim's suspicions, but in a different--and it must be added in\njustice to her--more innocent sense than he supposed, judging from\nformer doings.  She had accidentally discovered that Fitzpiers was in\nthe habit of coming secretly once or twice a week to Hintock, and knew\nthat this evening was a favorite one of the seven for his journey.  As\nshe was going next day to leave the country, Suke thought there could\nbe no great harm in giving way to a little sentimentality by obtaining\na glimpse of him quite unknown to himself or to anybody, and thus\ntaking a silent last farewell.  Aware that Fitzpiers's time for passing\nwas at hand she thus betrayed her feeling.  No sooner, therefore, had\nTim left the room than she let herself noiselessly out of the house,\nand hastened to the corner of the garden, whence she could witness the\nsurgeon's transit across the scene--if he had not already gone by.\n\nHer light cotton dress was visible to Tim lounging in the arbor of the\nopposite corner, though he was hidden from her.  He saw her stealthily\nclimb into the hedge, and so ensconce herself there that nobody could\nhave the least doubt her purpose was to watch unseen for a passer-by.\n\nHe went across to the spot and stood behind her.  Suke started, having\nin her blundering way forgotten that he might be near.  She at once\ndescended from the hedge.\n\n\"So he's coming to-night,\" said Tim, laconically.  \"And we be always\nanxious to see our dears.\"\n\n\"He IS coming to-night,\" she replied, with defiance.  \"And we BE\nanxious for our dears.\"\n\n\"Then will you step in-doors, where your dear will soon jine 'ee? We've\nto mouster by half-past three to-morrow, and if we don't get to bed by\neight at latest our faces will be as long as clock-cases all day.\"\n\nShe hesitated for a minute, but ultimately obeyed, going slowly down\nthe garden to the house, where he heard the door-latch click behind her.\n\nTim was incensed beyond measure.  His marriage had so far been a total\nfailure, a source of bitter regret; and the only course for improving\nhis case, that of leaving the country, was a sorry, and possibly might\nnot be a very effectual one.  Do what he would, his domestic sky was\nlikely to be overcast to the end of the day. Thus he brooded, and his\nresentment gathered force.  He craved a means of striking one blow back\nat the cause of his cheerless plight, while he was still on the scene\nof his discomfiture.  For some minutes no method suggested itself, and\nthen he had an idea.\n\nComing to a sudden resolution, he hastened along the garden, and\nentered the one attached to the next cottage, which had formerly been\nthe dwelling of a game-keeper.  Tim descended the path to the back of\nthe house, where only an old woman lived at present, and reaching the\nwall he stopped.  Owing to the slope of the ground the roof-eaves of\nthe linhay were here within touch, and he thrust his arm up under them,\nfeeling about in the space on the top of the wall-plate.\n\n\"Ah, I thought my memory didn't deceive me!\" he lipped silently.\n\nWith some exertion he drew down a cobwebbed object curiously framed in\niron, which clanked as he moved it.  It was about three feet in length\nand half as wide.  Tim contemplated it as well as he could in the dying\nlight of day, and raked off the cobwebs with his hand.\n\n\"That will spoil his pretty shins for'n, I reckon!\" he said.\n\nIt was a man-trap.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVII.\n\nWere the inventors of automatic machines to be ranged according to the\nexcellence of their devices for producing sound artistic torture, the\ncreator of the man-trap would occupy a very respectable if not a very\nhigh place.\n\nIt should rather, however, be said, the inventor of the particular form\nof man-trap of which this found in the keeper's out-house was a\nspecimen.  For there were other shapes and other sizes, instruments\nwhich, if placed in a row beside one of the type disinterred by Tim,\nwould have worn the subordinate aspect of the bears, wild boars, or\nwolves in a travelling menagerie, as compared with the leading lion or\ntiger.  In short, though many varieties had been in use during those\ncenturies which we are accustomed to look back upon as the true and\nonly period of merry England--in the rural districts more\nespecially--and onward down to the third decade of the nineteenth\ncentury, this model had borne the palm, and had been most usually\nfollowed when the orchards and estates required new ones.\n\nThere had been the toothless variety used by the softer-hearted\nlandlords--quite contemptible in their clemency.  The jaws of these\nresembled the jaws of an old woman to whom time has left nothing but\ngums.  There were also the intermediate or half-toothed sorts,\nprobably devised by the middle-natured squires, or those under the\ninfluence of their wives: two inches of mercy, two inches of cruelty,\ntwo inches of mere nip, two inches of probe, and so on, through the\nwhole extent of the jaws.  There were also, as a class apart, the\nbruisers, which did not lacerate the flesh, but only crushed the bone.\n\nThe sight of one of these gins when set produced a vivid impression\nthat it was endowed with life.  It exhibited the combined aspects of a\nshark, a crocodile, and a scorpion.  Each tooth was in the form of a\ntapering spine, two and a quarter inches long, which, when the jaws\nwere closed, stood in alternation from this side and from that.  When\nthey were open, the two halves formed a complete circle between two and\nthree feet in diameter, the plate or treading-place in the midst being\nabout a foot square, while from beneath extended in opposite directions\nthe soul of the apparatus, the pair of springs, each one being of a\nstiffness to render necessary a lever or the whole weight of the body\nwhen forcing it down.\n\nThere were men at this time still living at Hintock who remembered when\nthe gin and others like it were in use.  Tim Tangs's great-uncle had\nendured a night of six hours in this very trap, which lamed him for\nlife.  Once a keeper of Hintock woods set it on the track of a poacher,\nand afterwards, coming back that way, forgetful of what he had done,\nwalked into it himself.  The wound brought on lockjaw, of which he\ndied.  This event occurred during the thirties, and by the year 1840\nthe use of such implements was well-nigh discontinued in the\nneighborhood.  But being made entirely of iron, they by no means\ndisappeared, and in almost every village one could be found in some\nnook or corner as readily as this was found by Tim.  It had, indeed,\nbeen a fearful amusement of Tim and other Hintock lads--especially\nthose who had a dim sense of becoming renowned poachers when they\nreached their prime--to drag out this trap from its hiding, set it, and\nthrow it with billets of wood, which were penetrated by the teeth to\nthe depth of near an inch.\n\nAs soon as he had examined the trap, and found that the hinges and\nsprings were still perfect, he shouldered it without more ado, and\nreturned with his burden to his own garden, passing on through the\nhedge to the path immediately outside the boundary.  Here, by the help\nof a stout stake, he set the trap, and laid it carefully behind a bush\nwhile he went forward to reconnoitre.  As has been stated, nobody\npassed this way for days together sometimes; but there was just a\npossibility that some other pedestrian than the one in request might\narrive, and it behooved Tim to be careful as to the identity of his\nvictim.\n\nGoing about a hundred yards along the rising ground to the right, he\nreached a ridge whereon a large and thick holly grew.  Beyond this for\nsome distance the wood was more open, and the course which Fitzpiers\nmust pursue to reach the point, if he came to-night, was visible a\nlong way forward.\n\nFor some time there was no sign of him or of anybody.  Then there\nshaped itself a spot out of the dim mid-distance, between the masses of\nbrushwood on either hand.  And it enlarged, and Tim could hear the\nbrushing of feet over the tufts of sour-grass.  The airy gait revealed\nFitzpiers even before his exact outline could be seen.\n\nTim Tangs turned about, and ran down the opposite side of the hill,\ntill he was again at the head of his own garden.  It was the work of a\nfew moments to drag out the man-trap, very gently--that the plate might\nnot be disturbed sufficiently to throw it--to a space between a pair of\nyoung oaks which, rooted in contiguity, grew apart upward, forming a\nV-shaped opening between; and, being backed up by bushes, left this as\nthe only course for a foot-passenger.  In it he laid the trap with the\nsame gentleness of handling, locked the chain round one of the trees,\nand finally slid back the guard which was placed to keep the gin from\naccidentally catching the arms of him who set it, or, to use the local\nand better word, \"toiled\" it.\n\nHaving completed these arrangements, Tim sprang through the adjoining\nhedge of his father's garden, ran down the path, and softly entered the\nhouse.\n\nObedient to his order, Suke had gone to bed; and as soon as he had\nbolted the door, Tim unlaced and kicked off his boots at the foot of\nthe stairs, and retired likewise, without lighting a candle. His object\nseemed to be to undress as soon as possible.  Before, however, he had\ncompleted the operation, a long cry resounded without--penetrating, but\nindescribable.\n\n\"What's that?\" said Suke, starting up in bed.\n\n\"Sounds as if somebody had caught a hare in his gin.\"\n\n\"Oh no,\" said she.  \"It was not a hare, 'twas louder.  Hark!\"\n\n\"Do 'ee get to sleep,\" said Tim.  \"How be you going to wake at\nhalf-past three else?\"\n\nShe lay down and was silent.  Tim stealthily opened the window and\nlistened.  Above the low harmonies produced by the instrumentation of\nthe various species of trees around the premises he could hear the\ntwitching of a chain from the spot whereon he had set the man-trap.\nBut further human sound there was none.\n\nTim was puzzled.  In the haste of his project he had not calculated\nupon a cry; but if one, why not more? He soon ceased to essay an\nanswer, for Hintock was dead to him already.  In half a dozen hours he\nwould be out of its precincts for life, on his way to the antipodes.\nHe closed the window and lay down.\n\n\nThe hour which had brought these movements of Tim to birth had been\noperating actively elsewhere.  Awaiting in her father's house the\nminute of her appointment with her husband, Grace Fitzpiers deliberated\non many things.  Should she inform her father before going out that the\nestrangement of herself and Edgar was not so complete as he had\nimagined, and deemed desirable for her happiness? If she did so she\nmust in some measure become the apologist of her husband, and she was\nnot prepared to go so far.\n\nAs for him, he kept her in a mood of considerate gravity.  He certainly\nhad changed.  He had at his worst times always been gentle in his\nmanner towards her.  Could it be that she might make of him a true and\nworthy husband yet?  She had married him; there was no getting over\nthat; and ought she any longer to keep him at a distance?  His suave\ndeference to her lightest whim on the question of his comings and\ngoings, when as her lawful husband he might show a little independence,\nwas a trait in his character as unexpected as it was engaging.  If she\nhad been his empress, and he her thrall, he could not have exhibited a\nmore sensitive care to avoid intruding upon her against her will.\n\nImpelled by a remembrance she took down a prayer-book and turned to the\nmarriage-service.  Reading it slowly through, she became quite appalled\nat her recent off-handedness, when she rediscovered what awfully solemn\npromises she had made him at those chancel steps not so very long ago.\n\nShe became lost in long ponderings on how far a person's conscience\nmight be bound by vows made without at the time a full recognition of\ntheir force.  That particular sentence, beginning \"Whom God hath joined\ntogether,\" was a staggerer for a gentlewoman of strong devotional\nsentiment.  She wondered whether God really did join them together.\nBefore she had done deliberating the time of her engagement drew near,\nand she went out of the house almost at the moment that Tim Tangs\nretired to his own.\n\nThe position of things at that critical juncture was briefly as follows.\n\nTwo hundred yards to the right of the upper end of Tangs's garden\nFitzpiers was still advancing, having now nearly reached the summit of\nthe wood-clothed ridge, the path being the actual one which further on\npassed between the two young oaks.  Thus far it was according to Tim's\nconjecture.  But about two hundred yards to the left, or rather less,\nwas arising a condition which he had not divined, the emergence of\nGrace as aforesaid from the upper corner of her father's garden, with\nthe view of meeting Tim's intended victim.  Midway between husband and\nwife was the diabolical trap, silent, open, ready.\n\nFitzpiers's walk that night had been cheerful, for he was convinced\nthat the slow and gentle method he had adopted was promising success.\nThe very restraint that he was obliged to exercise upon himself, so as\nnot to kill the delicate bud of returning confidence, fed his flame.\nHe walked so much more rapidly than Grace that, if they continued\nadvancing as they had begun, he would reach the trap a good half-minute\nbefore she could reach the same spot.\n\nBut here a new circumstance came in; to escape the unpleasantness of\nbeing watched or listened to by lurkers--naturally curious by reason of\ntheir strained relations--they had arranged that their meeting for\nto-night should be at the holm-tree on the ridge above named.  So soon,\naccordingly, as Fitzpiers reached the tree he stood still to await her.\n\nHe had not paused under the prickly foliage more than two minutes when\nhe thought he heard a scream from the other side of the ridge.\nFitzpiers wondered what it could mean; but such wind as there was just\nnow blew in an adverse direction, and his mood was light.  He set down\nthe origin of the sound to one of the superstitious freaks or\nfrolicsome scrimmages between sweethearts that still survived in\nHintock from old-English times; and waited on where he stood till ten\nminutes had passed.  Feeling then a little uneasy, his mind reverted to\nthe scream; and he went forward over the summit and down the embowered\nincline, till he reached the pair of sister oaks with the narrow\nopening between them.\n\nFitzpiers stumbled and all but fell.  Stretching down his hand to\nascertain the obstruction, it came in contact with a confused mass of\nsilken drapery and iron-work that conveyed absolutely no explanatory\nidea to his mind at all.  It was but the work of a moment to strike a\nmatch; and then he saw a sight which congealed his blood.\n\nThe man-trap was thrown; and between its jaws was part of a woman's\nclothing--a patterned silk skirt--gripped with such violence that the\niron teeth had passed through it, skewering its tissue in a score of\nplaces.  He immediately recognized the skirt as that of one of his\nwife's gowns--the gown that she had worn when she met him on the very\nlast occasion.\n\nFitzpiers had often studied the effect of these instruments when\nexamining the collection at Hintock House, and the conception instantly\nflashed through him that Grace had been caught, taken out mangled by\nsome chance passer, and carried home, some of her clothes being left\nbehind in the difficulty of getting her free. The shock of this\nconviction, striking into the very current of high hope, was so great\nthat he cried out like one in corporal agony, and in his misery bowed\nhimself down to the ground.\n\nOf all the degrees and qualities of punishment that Fitzpiers had\nundergone since his sins against Grace first began, not any even\napproximated in intensity to this.\n\n\"Oh, my own--my darling! Oh, cruel Heaven--it is too much, this!\" he\ncried, writhing and rocking himself over the sorry accessaries of her\nhe deplored.\n\nThe voice of his distress was sufficiently loud to be audible to any\none who might have been there to hear it; and one there was. Right and\nleft of the narrow pass between the oaks were dense bushes; and now\nfrom behind these a female figure glided, whose appearance even in the\ngloom was, though graceful in outline, noticeably strange.\n\nShe was in white up to the waist, and figured above.  She was, in\nshort, Grace, his wife, lacking the portion of her dress which the gin\nretained.\n\n\"Don't be grieved about me--don't, dear Edgar!\" she exclaimed, rushing\nup and bending over him.  \"I am not hurt a bit! I was coming on to find\nyou after I had released myself, but I heard footsteps; and I hid away,\nbecause I was without some of my clothing, and I did not know who the\nperson might be.\"\n\nFitzpiers had sprung to his feet, and his next act was no less\nunpremeditated by him than it was irresistible by her, and would have\nbeen so by any woman not of Amazonian strength.  He clasped his arms\ncompletely round, pressed her to his breast, and kissed her\npassionately.\n\n\"You are not dead!--you are not hurt! Thank God--thank God!\" he said,\nalmost sobbing in his delight and relief from the horror of his\napprehension.  \"Grace, my wife, my love, how is this--what has\nhappened?\"\n\n\"I was coming on to you,\" she said as distinctly as she could in the\nhalf-smothered state of her face against his.  \"I was trying to be as\npunctual as possible, and as I had started a minute late I ran along\nthe path very swiftly--fortunately for myself.  Just when I had passed\nbetween these trees I felt something clutch at my dress from behind\nwith a noise, and the next moment I was pulled backward by it, and fell\nto the ground.  I screamed with terror, thinking it was a man lying\ndown there to murder me, but the next moment I discovered it was iron,\nand that my clothes were caught in a trap.  I pulled this way and that,\nbut the thing would not let go, drag it as I would, and I did not know\nwhat to do.  I did not want to alarm my father or anybody, as I wished\nnobody to know of these meetings with you; so I could think of no other\nplan than slipping off my skirt, meaning to run on and tell you what a\nstrange accident had happened to me.  But when I had just freed myself\nby leaving the dress behind, I heard steps, and not being sure it was\nyou, I did not like to be seen in such a pickle, so I hid away.\"\n\n\"It was only your speed that saved you! One or both of your legs would\nhave been broken if you had come at ordinary walking pace.\"\n\n\"Or yours, if you had got here first,\" said she, beginning to realize\nthe whole ghastliness of the possibility.  \"Oh, Edgar, there has been\nan Eye watching over us to-night, and we should be thankful indeed!\"\n\nHe continued to press his face to hers.  \"You are mine--mine again now.\"\n\nShe gently owned that she supposed she was.  \"I heard what you said\nwhen you thought I was injured,\" she went on, shyly, \"and I know that a\nman who could suffer as you were suffering must have a tender regard\nfor me.  But how does this awful thing come here?\"\n\n\"I suppose it has something to do with poachers.\" Fitzpiers was still\nso shaken by the sense of her danger that he was obliged to sit awhile,\nand it was not until Grace said, \"If I could only get my skirt out\nnobody would know anything about it,\" that he bestirred himself.\n\nBy their united efforts, each standing on one of the springs of the\ntrap, they pressed them down sufficiently to insert across the jaws a\nbillet which they dragged from a faggot near at hand; and it was then\npossible to extract the silk mouthful from the monster's bite, creased\nand pierced with many holes, but not torn. Fitzpiers assisted her to\nput it on again; and when her customary contours were thus restored\nthey walked on together, Grace taking his arm, till he effected an\nimprovement by clasping it round her waist.\n\nThe ice having been broken in this unexpected manner, she made no\nfurther attempt at reserve.  \"I would ask you to come into the house,\"\nshe said, \"but my meetings with you have been kept secret from my\nfather, and I should like to prepare him.\"\n\n\"Never mind, dearest.  I could not very well have accepted the\ninvitation.  I shall never live here again--as much for your sake as\nfor mine.  I have news to tell you on this very point, but my alarm had\nput it out of my head.  I have bought a practice, or rather a\npartnership, in the Midlands, and I must go there in a week to take up\npermanent residence.  My poor old great-aunt died about eight months\nago, and left me enough to do this.  I have taken a little furnished\nhouse for a time, till we can get one of our own.\"\n\nHe described the place, and the surroundings, and the view from the\nwindows, and Grace became much interested.  \"But why are you not there\nnow?\" she said.\n\n\"Because I cannot tear myself away from here till I have your promise.\nNow, darling, you will accompany me there--will you not? To-night has\nsettled that.\"\n\nGrace's tremblings had gone off, and she did not say nay.  They went on\ntogether.\n\nThe adventure, and the emotions consequent upon the reunion which that\nevent had forced on, combined to render Grace oblivious of the\ndirection of their desultory ramble, till she noticed they were in an\nencircled glade in the densest part of the wood, whereon the moon, that\nhad imperceptibly added its rays to the scene, shone almost vertically.\nIt was an exceptionally soft, balmy evening for the time of year, which\nwas just that transient period in the May month when beech-trees have\nsuddenly unfolded large limp young leaves of the softness of\nbutterflies' wings. Boughs bearing such leaves hung low around, and\ncompletely enclosed them, so that it was as if they were in a great\ngreen vase, which had moss for its bottom and leaf sides.\n\nThe clouds having been packed in the west that evening so as to retain\nthe departing glare a long while, the hour had seemed much earlier than\nit was.  But suddenly the question of time occurred to her.\n\n\"I must go back,\" she said; and without further delay they set their\nfaces towards Hintock.  As they walked he examined his watch by the aid\nof the now strong moonlight.\n\n\"By the gods, I think I have lost my train!\" said Fitzpiers.\n\n\"Dear me--whereabouts are we?\" said she.\n\n\"Two miles in the direction of Sherton.\"\n\n\"Then do you hasten on, Edgar.  I am not in the least afraid.  I\nrecognize now the part of the wood we are in and I can find my way back\nquite easily.  I'll tell my father that we have made it up. I wish I\nhad not kept our meetings so private, for it may vex him a little to\nknow I have been seeing you.  He is getting old and irritable, that was\nwhy I did not.  Good-by.\"\n\n\"But, as I must stay at the Earl of Wessex to-night, for I cannot\npossibly catch the train, I think it would be safer for you to let me\ntake care of you.\"\n\n\"But what will my father think has become of me? He does not know in\nthe least where I am--he thinks I only went into the garden for a few\nminutes.\"\n\n\"He will surely guess--somebody has seen me for certain.  I'll go all\nthe way back with you to-morrow.\"\n\n\"But that newly done-up place--the Earl of Wessex!\"\n\n\"If you are so very particular about the publicity I will stay at the\nThree Tuns.\"\n\n\"Oh no--it is not that I am particular--but I haven't a brush or comb\nor anything!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\n\nAll the evening Melbury had been coming to his door, saying, \"I wonder\nwhere in the world that girl is! Never in all my born days did I know\nher bide out like this!  She surely said she was going into the garden\nto get some parsley.\"\n\nMelbury searched the garden, the parsley-bed, and the orchard, but\ncould find no trace of her, and then he made inquiries at the cottages\nof such of his workmen as had not gone to bed, avoiding Tangs's because\nhe knew the young people were to rise early to leave.  In these\ninquiries one of the men's wives somewhat incautiously let out the fact\nthat she had heard a scream in the wood, though from which direction\nshe could not say.\n\nThis set Melbury's fears on end.  He told the men to light lanterns,\nand headed by himself they started, Creedle following at the last\nmoment with quite a burden of grapnels and ropes, which he could not be\npersuaded to leave behind, and the company being joined by the\nhollow-turner and the man who kept the cider-house as they went along.\n\nThey explored the precincts of the village, and in a short time lighted\nupon the man-trap.  Its discovery simply added an item of fact without\nhelping their conjectures; but Melbury's indefinite alarm was greatly\nincreased when, holding a candle to the ground, he saw in the teeth of\nthe instrument some frayings from Grace's clothing.  No intelligence of\nany kind was gained till they met a woodman of Delborough, who said\nthat he had seen a lady answering to the description her father gave of\nGrace, walking through the wood on a gentleman's arm in the direction\nof Sherton.\n\n\"Was he clutching her tight?\" said Melbury.\n\n\"Well--rather,\" said the man.\n\n\"Did she walk lame?\"\n\n\"Well, 'tis true her head hung over towards him a bit.\"\n\nCreedle groaned tragically.\n\nMelbury, not suspecting the presence of Fitzpiers, coupled this account\nwith the man-trap and the scream; he could not understand what it all\nmeant; but the sinister event of the trap made him follow on.\nAccordingly, they bore away towards the town, shouting as they went,\nand in due course emerged upon the highway.\n\nNearing Sherton-Abbas, the previous information was confirmed by other\nstrollers, though the gentleman's supporting arm had disappeared from\nthese later accounts.  At last they were so near Sherton that Melbury\ninformed his faithful followers that he did not wish to drag them\nfarther at so late an hour, since he could go on alone and inquire if\nthe woman who had been seen were really Grace.  But they would not\nleave him alone in his anxiety, and trudged onward till the lamplight\nfrom the town began to illuminate their fronts.  At the entrance to the\nHigh Street they got fresh scent of the pursued, but coupled with the\nnew condition that the lady in the costume described had been going up\nthe street alone.\n\n\"Faith!--I believe she's mesmerized, or walking in her sleep,\" said\nMelbury.\n\nHowever, the identity of this woman with Grace was by no means certain;\nbut they plodded along the street.  Percombe, the hair-dresser, who\nhad despoiled Marty of her tresses, was standing at his door, and they\nduly put inquiries to him.\n\n\"Ah--how's Little Hintock folk by now?\" he said, before replying.\n\"Never have I been over there since one winter night some three year\nago--and then I lost myself finding it.  How can ye live in such a\none-eyed place?  Great Hintock is bad enough--hut Little Hintock--the\nbats and owls would drive me melancholy-mad! It took two days to raise\nmy sperrits to their true pitch again after that night I went there.\nMr. Melbury, sir, as a man's that put by money, why not retire and live\nhere, and see something of the world?\"\n\nThe responses at last given by him to their queries guided them to the\nbuilding that offered the best accommodation in Sherton--having been\nenlarged contemporaneously with the construction of the\nrailway--namely, the Earl of Wessex Hotel.\n\nLeaving the others without, Melbury made prompt inquiry here.  His\nalarm was lessened, though his perplexity was increased, when he\nreceived a brief reply that such a lady was in the house.\n\n\"Do you know if it is my daughter?\" asked Melbury.\n\nThe waiter did not.\n\n\"Do you know the lady's name?\"\n\nOf this, too, the household was ignorant, the hotel having been taken\nby brand-new people from a distance.  They knew the gentleman very well\nby sight, and had not thought it necessary to ask him to enter his name.\n\n\"Oh, the gentleman appears again now,\" said Melbury to himself. \"Well,\nI want to see the lady,\" he declared.\n\nA message was taken up, and after some delay the shape of Grace\nappeared descending round the bend of the stair-case, looking as if she\nlived there, but in other respects rather guilty and frightened.\n\n\"Why--what the name--\" began her father.  \"I thought you went out to\nget parsley!\"\n\n\"Oh, yes--I did--but it is all right,\" said Grace, in a flurried\nwhisper.  \"I am not alone here.  I am here with Edgar.  It is entirely\nowing to an accident, father.\"\n\n\"Edgar! An accident! How does he come here?  I thought he was two\nhundred mile off.\"\n\n\"Yes, so he is--I mean he has got a beautiful practice two hundred\nmiles off; he has bought it with his own money, some that came to him.\nBut he travelled here, and I was nearly caught in a man-trap, and\nthat's how it is I am here.  We were just thinking of sending a\nmessenger to let you know.\"\n\nMelbury did not seem to be particularly enlightened by this explanation.\n\n\"You were caught in a man-trap?\"\n\n\"Yes; my dress was.  That's how it arose.  Edgar is up-stairs in his\nown sitting-room,\" she went on.  \"He would not mind seeing you, I am\nsure.\"\n\n\"Oh, faith, I don't want to see him! I have seen him too often a'ready.\nI'll see him another time, perhaps, if 'tis to oblige 'ee.\"\n\n\"He came to see me; he wanted to consult me about this large\npartnership I speak of, as it is very promising.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am glad to hear it,\" said Melbury, dryly.\n\nA pause ensued, during which the inquiring faces and whity-brown\nclothes of Melbury's companions appeared in the door-way.\n\n\"Then bain't you coming home with us?\" he asked.\n\n\"I--I think not,\" said Grace, blushing.\n\n\"H'm--very well--you are your own mistress,\" he returned, in tones\nwhich seemed to assert otherwise.  \"Good-night;\" and Melbury retreated\ntowards the door.\n\n\"Don't be angry, father,\" she said, following him a few steps.  \"I have\ndone it for the best.\"\n\n\"I am not angry, though it is true I have been a little misled in this.\nHowever, good-night.  I must get home along.\"\n\nHe left the hotel, not without relief, for to be under the eyes of\nstrangers while he conversed with his lost child had embarrassed him\nmuch.  His search-party, too, had looked awkward there, having rushed\nto the task of investigation--some in their shirt sleeves, others in\ntheir leather aprons, and all much stained--just as they had come from\ntheir work of barking, and not in their Sherton marketing attire; while\nCreedle, with his ropes and grapnels and air of impending tragedy, had\nadded melancholy to gawkiness.\n\n\"Now, neighbors,\" said Melbury, on joining them, \"as it is getting\nlate, we'll leg it home again as fast as we can.  I ought to tell you\nthat there has been some mistake--some arrangement entered into between\nMr. and Mrs. Fitzpiers which I didn't quite understand--an important\npractice in the Midland counties has come to him, which made it\nnecessary for her to join him to-night--so she says.  That's all it\nwas--and I'm sorry I dragged you out.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the hollow-turner, \"here be we six mile from home, and\nnight-time, and not a hoss or four-footed creeping thing to our name.\nI say, we'll have a mossel and a drop o' summat to strengthen our\nnerves afore we vamp all the way back again?  My throat's as dry as a\nkex.  What d'ye say so's?\"\n\nThey all concurred in the need for this course, and proceeded to the\nantique and lampless back street, in which the red curtain of the Three\nTuns was the only radiant object.  As soon as they had stumbled down\ninto the room Melbury ordered them to be served, when they made\nthemselves comfortable by the long table, and stretched out their legs\nupon the herring-boned sand of the floor. Melbury himself, restless as\nusual, walked to the door while he waited for them, and looked up and\ndown the street.\n\n\"I'd gie her a good shaking if she were my maid; pretending to go out\nin the garden, and leading folk a twelve-mile traipse that have got to\nget up at five o'clock to morrow,\" said a bark-ripper; who, not working\nregularly for Melbury, could afford to indulge in strong opinions.\n\n\"I don't speak so warm as that,\" said the hollow-turner, \"but if 'tis\nright for couples to make a country talk about their separating, and\nexcite the neighbors, and then make fools of 'em like this, why, I\nhaven't stood upon one leg for five-and-twenty year.\"\n\nAll his listeners knew that when he alluded to his foot-lathe in these\nenigmatic terms, the speaker meant to be impressive; and Creedle chimed\nin with, \"Ah, young women do wax wanton in these days! Why couldn't she\nha' bode with her father, and been faithful?\" Poor Creedle was thinking\nof his old employer.\n\n\"But this deceiving of folks is nothing unusual in matrimony,\" said\nFarmer Bawtree.  \"I knowed a man and wife--faith, I don't mind owning,\nas there's no strangers here, that the pair were my own\nrelations--they'd be at it that hot one hour that you'd hear the poker\nand the tongs and the bellows and the warming-pan flee across the house\nwith the movements of their vengeance; and the next hour you'd hear 'em\nsinging 'The Spotted Cow' together as peaceable as two holy twins;\nyes--and very good voices they had, and would strike in like\nprofessional ballet-singers to one another's support in the high notes.\"\n\n\"And I knowed a woman, and the husband o' her went away for\nfour-and-twenty year,\" said the bark-ripper.  \"And one night he came home\nwhen she was sitting by the fire, and thereupon he sat down himself on\nthe other side of the chimney-corner.  'Well,' says she, 'have ye got\nany news?'  'Don't know as I have,' says he; 'have you?'  'No,' says\nshe, 'except that my daughter by my second husband was married last\nmonth, which was a year after I was made a widow by him.'  'Oh!\nAnything else?' he says.  'No,' says she. And there they sat, one on\neach side of that chimney-corner, and were found by their neighbors\nsound asleep in their chairs, not having known what to talk about at\nall.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't care who the man is,\" said Creedle, \"they required a\ngood deal to talk about, and that's true.  It won't be the same with\nthese.\"\n\n\"No.  He is such a projick, you see.  And she is a wonderful scholar\ntoo!\"\n\n\"What women do know nowadays!\" observed the hollow-turner.  \"You can't\ndeceive 'em as you could in my time.\"\n\n\"What they knowed then was not small,\" said John Upjohn.  \"Always a\ngood deal more than the men! Why, when I went courting my wife that is\nnow, the skilfulness that she would show in keeping me on her pretty\nside as she walked was beyond all belief.  Perhaps you've noticed that\nshe's got a pretty side to her face as well as a plain one?\"\n\n\"I can't say I've noticed it particular much,\" said the hollow-turner,\nblandly.\n\n\"Well,\" continued Upjohn, not disconcerted, \"she has.  All women under\nthe sun be prettier one side than t'other.  And, as I was saying, the\npains she would take to make me walk on the pretty side were unending!\nI warrant that whether we were going with the sun or against the sun,\nuphill or downhill, in wind or in lewth, that wart of hers was always\ntowards the hedge, and that dimple towards me.  There was I, too simple\nto see her wheelings and turnings; and she so artful, though two years\nyounger, that she could lead me with a cotton thread, like a blind ram;\nfor that was in the third climate of our courtship.  No; I don't think\nthe women have got cleverer, for they was never otherwise.\"\n\n\"How many climates may there be in courtship, Mr. Upjohn?\" inquired a\nyouth--the same who had assisted at Winterborne's Christmas party.\n\n\"Five--from the coolest to the hottest--leastwise there was five in\nmine.\"\n\n\"Can ye give us the chronicle of 'em, Mr. Upjohn?\"\n\n\"Yes--I could.  I could certainly.  But 'tis quite unnecessary. They'll\ncome to ye by nater, young man, too soon for your good.\"\n\n\"At present Mrs. Fitzpiers can lead the doctor as your mis'ess could\nlead you,\" the hollow-turner remarked.  \"She's got him quite tame.  But\nhow long 'twill last I can't say.  I happened to be setting a wire on\nthe top of my garden one night when he met her on the other side of the\nhedge; and the way she queened it, and fenced, and kept that poor\nfeller at a distance, was enough to freeze yer blood.  I should never\nhave supposed it of such a girl.\"\n\nMelbury now returned to the room, and the men having declared\nthemselves refreshed, they all started on the homeward journey, which\nwas by no means cheerless under the rays of the high moon. Having to\nwalk the whole distance they came by a foot-path rather shorter than\nthe highway, though difficult except to those who knew the country\nwell.  This brought them by way of Great Hintock; and passing the\nchurch-yard they observed, as they talked, a motionless figure standing\nby the gate.\n\n\"I think it was Marty South,\" said the hollow-turner, parenthetically.\n\n\"I think 'twas; 'a was always a lonely maid,\" said Upjohn.  And they\npassed on homeward, and thought of the matter no more.\n\nIt was Marty, as they had supposed.  That evening had been the\nparticular one of the week upon which Grace and herself had been\naccustomed to privately deposit flowers on Giles's grave, and this was\nthe first occasion since his death, eight months earlier, on which\nGrace had failed to keep her appointment.  Marty had waited in the road\njust outside Little Hintock, where her fellow-pilgrim had been wont to\njoin her, till she was weary; and at last, thinking that Grace had\nmissed her and gone on alone, she followed the way to Great Hintock,\nbut saw no Grace in front of her.  It got later, and Marty continued\nher walk till she reached the church-yard gate; but still no Grace.\nYet her sense of comradeship would not allow her to go on to the grave\nalone, and still thinking the delay had been unavoidable, she stood\nthere with her little basket of flowers in her clasped hands, and her\nfeet chilled by the damp ground, till more than two hours had passed.\n\nShe then heard the footsteps of Melbury's men, who presently passed on\ntheir return from the search.  In the silence of the night Marty could\nnot help hearing fragments of their conversation, from which she\nacquired a general idea of what had occurred, and where Mrs. Fitzpiers\nthen was.\n\nImmediately they had dropped down the hill she entered the church-yard,\ngoing to a secluded corner behind the bushes, where rose the\nunadorned stone that marked the last bed of Giles Winterborne.  As this\nsolitary and silent girl stood there in the moonlight, a straight slim\nfigure, clothed in a plaitless gown, the contours of womanhood so\nundeveloped as to be scarcely perceptible, the marks of poverty and\ntoil effaced by the misty hour, she touched sublimity at points, and\nlooked almost like a being who had rejected with indifference the\nattribute of sex for the loftier quality of abstract humanism.  She\nstooped down and cleared away the withered flowers that Grace and\nherself had laid there the previous week, and put her fresh ones in\ntheir place.\n\n\"Now, my own, own love,\" she whispered, \"you are mine, and on'y mine;\nfor she has forgot 'ee at last, although for her you died. But\nI--whenever I get up I'll think of 'ee, and whenever I lie down I'll\nthink of 'ee.  Whenever I plant the young larches I'll think that none\ncan plant as you planted; and whenever I split a gad, and whenever I\nturn the cider-wring, I'll say none could do it like you.  If ever I\nforget your name, let me forget home and Heaven!--But no, no, my love,\nI never can forget 'ee; for you was a GOOD man, and did good things!\"",
