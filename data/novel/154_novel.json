 "text": "THE RISE OF SILAS LAPHAM\n\n\nby\n\nWilliam Dean Howells\n\n\nJTABLE 5 27 1\n\n\n\nI.\n\n\nWHEN Bartley Hubbard went to interview Silas Lapham for the \"Solid Men\nof Boston\" series, which he undertook to finish up in The Events, after\nhe replaced their original projector on that newspaper, Lapham received\nhim in his private office by previous appointment.\n\n\"Walk right in!\" he called out to the journalist, whom he caught sight\nof through the door of the counting-room.\n\nHe did not rise from the desk at which he was writing, but he gave\nBartley his left hand for welcome, and he rolled his large head in the\ndirection of a vacant chair.  \"Sit down! I'll be with you in just half\na minute.\"\n\n\"Take your time,\" said Bartley, with the ease he instantly felt.  \"I'm\nin no hurry.\" He took a note-book from his pocket, laid it on his knee,\nand began to sharpen a pencil.\n\n\"There!\" Lapham pounded with his great hairy fist on the envelope he\nhad been addressing.\n\n\"William!\" he called out, and he handed the letter to a boy who came to\nget it.  \"I want that to go right away.  Well, sir,\" he continued,\nwheeling round in his leather-cushioned swivel-chair, and facing\nBartley, seated so near that their knees almost touched, \"so you want\nmy life, death, and Christian sufferings, do you, young man?\"\n\n\"That's what I'm after,\" said Bartley.  \"Your money or your life.\"\n\n\"I guess you wouldn't want my life without the money,\" said Lapham, as\nif he were willing to prolong these moments of preparation.\n\n\"Take 'em both,\" Bartley suggested.  \"Don't want your money without\nyour life, if you come to that.  But you're just one million times more\ninteresting to the public than if you hadn't a dollar; and you know\nthat as well as I do, Mr. Lapham.  There's no use beating about the\nbush.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Lapham, somewhat absently.  He put out his huge foot and\npushed the ground-glass door shut between his little den and the\nbook-keepers, in their larger den outside.\n\n\"In personal appearance,\" wrote Bartley in the sketch for which he now\nstudied his subject, while he waited patiently for him to continue,\n\"Silas Lapham is a fine type of the successful American.  He has a\nsquare, bold chin, only partially concealed by the short reddish-grey\nbeard, growing to the edges of his firmly closing lips.  His nose is\nshort and straight; his forehead good, but broad rather than high; his\neyes blue, and with a light in them that is kindly or sharp according\nto his mood.  He is of medium height, and fills an average arm-chair\nwith a solid bulk, which on the day of our interview was\nunpretentiously clad in a business suit of blue serge.  His head droops\nsomewhat from a short neck, which does not trouble itself to rise far\nfrom a pair of massive shoulders.\"\n\n\"I don't know as I know just where you want me to begin,\" said Lapham.\n\n\"Might begin with your birth; that's where most of us begin,\" replied\nBartley.\n\nA gleam of humorous appreciation shot into Lapham's blue eyes.\n\n\"I didn't know whether you wanted me to go quite so far back as that,\"\nhe said.  \"But there's no disgrace in having been born, and I was born\nin the State of Vermont, pretty well up under the Canada line--so well\nup, in fact, that I came very near being an adoptive citizen; for I was\nbound to be an American of SOME sort, from the word Go! That was\nabout--well, let me see!--pretty near sixty years ago: this is '75, and\nthat was '20. Well, say I'm fifty-five years old; and I've LIVED 'em,\ntoo; not an hour of waste time about ME, anywheres! I was born on a\nfarm, and----\"\n\n\"Worked in the fields summers and went to school winters: regulation\nthing?\" Bartley cut in.\n\n\"Regulation thing,\" said Lapham, accepting this irreverent version of\nhis history somewhat dryly.\n\n\"Parents poor, of course,\" suggested the journalist.  \"Any barefoot\nbusiness? Early deprivations of any kind, that would encourage the\nyouthful reader to go and do likewise? Orphan myself, you know,\" said\nBartley, with a smile of cynical good-comradery.\n\nLapham looked at him silently, and then said with quiet self-respect,\n\"I guess if you see these things as a joke, my life won't interest you.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, it will,\" returned Bartley, unabashed.  \"You'll see; it'll\ncome out all right.\" And in fact it did so, in the interview which\nBartley printed.\n\n\"Mr. Lapham,\" he wrote, \"passed rapidly over the story of his early\nlife, its poverty and its hardships, sweetened, however, by the\nrecollections of a devoted mother, and a father who, if somewhat her\ninferior in education, was no less ambitious for the advancement of his\nchildren.  They were quiet, unpretentious people, religious, after the\nfashion of that time, and of sterling morality, and they taught their\nchildren the simple virtues of the Old Testament and Poor Richard's\nAlmanac.\"\n\nBartley could not deny himself this gibe; but he trusted to Lapham's\nunliterary habit of mind for his security in making it, and most other\npeople would consider it sincere reporter's rhetoric.\n\n\"You know,\" he explained to Lapham, \"that we have to look at all these\nfacts as material, and we get the habit of classifying them.  Sometimes\na leading question will draw out a whole line of facts that a man\nhimself would never think of.\" He went on to put several queries, and\nit was from Lapham's answers that he generalised the history of his\nchildhood.  \"Mr. Lapham, although he did not dwell on his boyish trials\nand struggles, spoke of them with deep feeling and an abiding sense of\ntheir reality.\" This was what he added in the interview, and by the\ntime he had got Lapham past the period where risen Americans are all\npathetically alike in their narrow circumstances, their sufferings, and\ntheir aspirations, he had beguiled him into forgetfulness of the check\nhe had received, and had him talking again in perfect enjoyment of his\nautobiography.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Lapham, in a strain which Bartley was careful not to\ninterrupt again, \"a man never sees all that his mother has been to him\ntill it's too late to let her know that he sees it.  Why, my mother--\"\nhe stopped.  \"It gives me a lump in the throat,\" he said\napologetically, with an attempt at a laugh.  Then he went on: \"She was\na little frail thing, not bigger than a good-sized intermediate\nschool-girl; but she did the whole work of a family of boys, and\nboarded the hired men besides.  She cooked, swept, washed, ironed, made\nand mended from daylight till dark--and from dark till daylight, I was\ngoing to say; for I don't know how she got any time for sleep.  But I\nsuppose she did.  She got time to go to church, and to teach us to read\nthe Bible, and to misunderstand it in the old way.  She was GOOD.  But\nit ain't her on her knees in church that comes back to me so much like\nthe sight of an angel as her on her knees before me at night, washing\nmy poor, dirty little feet, that I'd run bare in all day, and making me\ndecent for bed.  There were six of us boys; it seems to me we were all\nof a size; and she was just so careful with all of us.  I can feel her\nhands on my feet yet!\" Bartley looked at Lapham's No. 10 boots, and\nsoftly whistled through his teeth.  \"We were patched all over; but we\nwa'n't ragged.  I don't know how she got through it.  She didn't seem\nto think it was anything; and I guess it was no more than my father\nexpected of her.  HE worked like a horse in doors and out--up at\ndaylight, feeding the stock, and groaning round all day with his\nrheumatism, but not stopping.\"\n\nBartley hid a yawn over his note-book, and probably, if he could have\nspoken his mind, he would have suggested to Lapham that he was not\nthere for the purpose of interviewing his ancestry.  But Bartley had\nlearned to practise a patience with his victims which he did not always\nfeel, and to feign an interest in their digressions till he could bring\nthem up with a round turn.\n\n\"I tell you,\" said Lapham, jabbing the point of his penknife into the\nwriting-pad on the desk before him, \"when I hear women complaining\nnowadays that their lives are stunted and empty, I want to tell 'em\nabout my MOTHER'S life.  I could paint it out for 'em.\"\n\nBartley saw his opportunity at the word paint, and cut in.  \"And you\nsay, Mr. Lapham, that you discovered this mineral paint on the old farm\nyourself?\"\n\nLapham acquiesced in the return to business.  \"I didn't discover it,\"\nhe said scrupulously.  \"My father found it one day, in a hole made by a\ntree blowing down.  There it was, lying loose in the pit, and sticking\nto the roots that had pulled up a big, cake of dirt with 'em. I don't\nknow what give him the idea that there was money in it, but he did\nthink so from the start.  I guess, if they'd had the word in those\ndays, they'd considered him pretty much of a crank about it.  He was\ntrying as long as he lived to get that paint introduced; but he\ncouldn't make it go.  The country was so poor they couldn't paint their\nhouses with anything; and father hadn't any facilities.  It got to be a\nkind of joke with us; and I guess that paint-mine did as much as any\none thing to make us boys clear out as soon as we got old enough.  All\nmy brothers went West, and took up land; but I hung on to New England\nand I hung on to the old farm, not because the paint-mine was on it,\nbut because the old house was--and the graves.  Well,\" said Lapham, as\nif unwilling to give himself too much credit, \"there wouldn't been any\nmarket for it, anyway.  You can go through that part of the State and\nbuy more farms than you can shake a stick at for less money than it\ncost to build the barns on 'em. Of course, it's turned out a good\nthing.  I keep the old house up in good shape, and we spend a month or\nso there every summer.  M' wife kind of likes it, and the girls.\nPretty place; sightly all round it.  I've got a force of men at work\nthere the whole time, and I've got a man and his wife in the house.\nHad a family meeting there last year; the whole connection from out\nWest.  There!\" Lapham rose from his seat and took down a large warped,\nunframed photograph from the top of his desk, passing his hand over it,\nand then blowing vigorously upon it, to clear it of the dust.  \"There\nwe are, ALL of us.\"\n\n\"I don't need to look twice at YOU,\" said Bartley, putting his finger\non one of the heads.\n\n\"Well, that's Bill,\" said Lapham, with a gratified laugh.  \"He's about\nas brainy as any of us, I guess.  He's one of their leading lawyers,\nout Dubuque way; been judge of the Common Pleas once or twice.  That's\nhis son--just graduated at Yale--alongside of my youngest girl.\nGood-looking chap, ain't he?\"\n\n\"SHE'S a good-looking chap,\" said Bartley, with prompt irreverence.  He\nhastened to add, at the frown which gathered between Lapham's eyes,\n\"What a beautiful creature she is! What a lovely, refined, sensitive\nface! And she looks GOOD, too.\"\n\n\"She is good,\" said the father, relenting.\n\n\"And, after all, that's about the best thing in a woman,\" said the\npotential reprobate.  \"If my wife wasn't good enough to keep both of us\nstraight, I don't know what would become of me.\" \"My other daughter,\"\nsaid Lapham, indicating a girl with eyes that showed large, and a face\nof singular gravity.  \"Mis' Lapham,\" he continued, touching his wife's\neffigy with his little finger.  \"My brother Willard and his\nfamily--farm at Kankakee.  Hazard Lapham and his wife--Baptist preacher\nin Kansas.  Jim and his three girls--milling business at Minneapolis.\nBen and his family--practising medicine in Fort Wayne.\"\n\nThe figures were clustered in an irregular group in front of an old\nfarm-house, whose original ugliness had been smartened up with a coat\nof Lapham's own paint, and heightened with an incongruous piazza.  The\nphotographer had not been able to conceal the fact that they were all\ndecent, honest-looking, sensible people, with a very fair share of\nbeauty among the young girls; some of these were extremely pretty, in\nfact.  He had put them into awkward and constrained attitudes, of\ncourse; and they all looked as if they had the instrument of torture\nwhich photographers call a head-rest under their occiputs.  Here and\nthere an elderly lady's face was a mere blur; and some of the younger\nchildren had twitched themselves into wavering shadows, and might have\npassed for spirit-photographs of their own little ghosts.  It was the\nstandard family-group photograph, in which most Americans have figured\nat some time or other; and Lapham exhibited a just satisfaction in it.\n\"I presume,\" he mused aloud, as he put it back on top of his desk,\n\"that we sha'n't soon get together again, all of us.\"\n\n\"And you say,\" suggested Bartley, \"that you stayed right along on the\nold place, when the rest cleared out West?\"\n\n\"No o-o-o,\" said Lapham, with a long, loud drawl; \"I cleared out West\ntoo, first off.  Went to Texas.  Texas was all the cry in those days.\nBut I got enough of the Lone Star in about three months, and I come\nback with the idea that Vermont was good enough for me.\"\n\n\"Fatted calf business?\" queried Bartley, with his pencil poised above\nhis note-book.\n\n\"I presume they were glad to see me,\" said Lapham, with dignity.\n\"Mother,\" he added gently, \"died that winter, and I stayed on with\nfather.  I buried him in the spring; and then I came down to a little\nplace called Lumberville, and picked up what jobs I could get.  I\nworked round at the saw-mills, and I was ostler a while at the hotel--I\nalways DID like a good horse.  Well, I WA'N'T exactly a college\ngraduate, and I went to school odd times.  I got to driving the stage\nafter while, and by and by I BOUGHT the stage and run the business\nmyself.  Then I hired the tavern-stand, and--well to make a long story\nshort, then I got married.  Yes,\" said Lapham, with pride, \"I married\nthe school-teacher. We did pretty well with the hotel, and my wife she\nwas always at me to paint up.  Well, I put it off, and PUT it off, as a\nman will, till one day I give in, and says I, 'Well, let's paint up.\nWhy, Pert,'--m'wife's name's Persis,--'I've got a whole paint-mine out\non the farm.  Let's go out and look at it.' So we drove out.  I'd let\nthe place for seventy-five dollars a year to a shif'less kind of a\nKanuck that had come down that way; and I'd hated to see the house with\nhim in it; but we drove out one Saturday afternoon, and we brought back\nabout a bushel of the stuff in the buggy-seat, and I tried it crude,\nand I tried it burnt; and I liked it.  M'wife she liked it too.  There\nwa'n't any painter by trade in the village, and I mixed it myself.\nWell, sir, that tavern's got that coat of paint on it yet, and it\nhain't ever had any other, and I don't know's it ever will.  Well, you\nknow, I felt as if it was a kind of harumscarum experiment, all the\nwhile; and I presume I shouldn't have tried it but I kind of liked to\ndo it because father'd always set so much store by his paint-mine. And\nwhen I'd got the first coat on,\"--Lapham called it CUT,--\"I presume I\nmust have set as much as half an hour; looking at it and thinking how\nhe would have enjoyed it.  I've had my share of luck in this world, and\nI ain't a-going to complain on my OWN account, but I've noticed that\nmost things get along too late for most people.  It made me feel bad,\nand it took all the pride out my success with the paint, thinking of\nfather.  Seemed to me I might 'a taken more interest in it when he was\nby to see; but we've got to live and learn.  Well, I called my wife\nout,--I'd tried it on the back of the house, you know,--and she left\nher dishes,--I can remember she came out with her sleeves rolled up and\nset down alongside of me on the trestle,--and says I, 'What do you\nthink, Persis?' And says she, 'Well, you hain't got a paint-mine, Silas\nLapham; you've got a GOLD-mine.' She always was just so enthusiastic\nabout things.  Well, it was just after two or three boats had burnt up\nout West, and a lot of lives lost, and there was a great cry about\nnon-inflammable paint, and I guess that was what was in her mind.\n'Well, I guess it ain't any gold-mine, Persis,' says I; 'but I guess it\nIS a paint-mine. I'm going to have it analysed, and if it turns out\nwhat I think it is, I'm going to work it.  And if father hadn't had\nsuch a long name, I should call it the Nehemiah Lapham Mineral Paint.\nBut, any rate, every barrel of it, and every keg, and every bottle, and\nevery package, big or little, has got to have the initials and figures\nN.L.f. 1835, S.L.t. 1855, on it.  Father found it in 1835, and I tried\nit in 1855.'\"\n\n\"'S.T.--1860--X.' business,\" said Bartley.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Lapham, \"but I hadn't heard of Plantation Bitters then, and\nI hadn't seen any of the fellow's labels.  I set to work and I got a\nman down from Boston; and I carried him out to the farm, and he\nanalysed it--made a regular Job of it.  Well, sir, we built a kiln, and\nwe kept a lot of that paint-ore red-hot for forty-eight hours; kept the\nKanuck and his family up, firing.  The presence of iron in the ore\nshowed with the magnet from the start; and when he came to test it, he\nfound out that it contained about seventy-five per cent. of the\nperoxide of iron.\"\n\nLapham pronounced the scientific phrases with a sort of reverent\nsatisfaction, as if awed through his pride by a little lingering\nuncertainty as to what peroxide was.  He accented it as if it were\npurr-ox-EYED; and Bartley had to get him to spell it.\n\n\"Well, and what then?\" he asked, when he had made a note of the\npercentage.\n\n\"What then?\" echoed Lapham.  \"Well, then, the fellow set down and told\nme, 'You've got a paint here,' says he, 'that's going to drive every\nother mineral paint out of the market.  Why' says he, 'it'll drive 'em\nright into the Back Bay!' Of course, I didn't know what the Back Bay\nwas then, but I begun to open my eyes; thought I'd had 'em open before,\nbut I guess I hadn't. Says he, 'That paint has got hydraulic cement in\nit, and it can stand fire and water and acids;' he named over a lot of\nthings.  Says he, 'It'll mix easily with linseed oil, whether you want\nto use it boiled or raw; and it ain't a-going to crack nor fade any;\nand it ain't a-going to scale.  When you've got your arrangements for\nburning it properly, you're going to have a paint that will stand like\nthe everlasting hills, in every climate under the sun.' Then he went\ninto a lot of particulars, and I begun to think he was drawing a\nlong-bow, and meant to make his bill accordingly.  So I kept pretty\ncool; but the fellow's bill didn't amount to anything hardly--said I\nmight pay him after I got going; young chap, and pretty easy; but every\nword he said was gospel.  Well, I ain't a-going to brag up my paint; I\ndon't suppose you came here to hear me blow.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I did,\" said Bartley.  \"That's what I want.  Tell all there is\nto tell, and I can boil it down afterward.  A man can't make a greater\nmistake with a reporter than to hold back anything out of modesty.  It\nmay be the very thing we want to know.  What we want is the whole\ntruth; and more; we've got so much modesty of our own that we can\ntemper almost any statement.\"\n\nLapham looked as if he did not quite like this tone, and he resumed a\nlittle more quietly.  \"Oh, there isn't really very much more to say\nabout the paint itself.  But you can use it for almost anything where a\npaint is wanted, inside or out.  It'll prevent decay, and it'll stop\nit, after it's begun, in tin or iron.  You can paint the inside of a\ncistern or a bath-tub with it, and water won't hurt it; and you can\npaint a steam-boiler with it, and heat won't.  You can cover a brick\nwall with it, or a railroad car, or the deck of a steamboat, and you\ncan't do a better thing for either.\"\n\n\"Never tried it on the human conscience, I suppose,\" suggested Bartley.\n\n\"No, sir,\" replied Lapham gravely.  \"I guess you want to keep that as\nfree from paint as you can, if you want much use of it.  I never cared\nto try any of it on mine.\" Lapham suddenly lifted his bulk up out of\nhis swivel-chair, and led the way out into the wareroom beyond the\noffice partitions, where rows and ranks of casks, barrels, and kegs\nstretched dimly back to the rear of the building, and diffused an\nhonest, clean, wholesome smell of oil and paint.  They were labelled\nand branded as containing each so many pounds of Lapham's Mineral\nPaint, and each bore the mystic devices, N.L.f. 1835--S.L.t. 1855.\n\"There!\" said Lapham, kicking one of the largest casks with the toe of\nhis boot, \"that's about our biggest package; and here,\" he added,\nlaying his hand affectionately on the head of a very small keg, as if\nit were the head of a child, which it resembled in size, \"this is the\nsmallest.  We used to put the paint on the market dry, but now we grind\nevery ounce of it in oil--very best quality of linseed oil--and warrant\nit.  We find it gives more satisfaction.  Now, come back to the office,\nand I'll show you our fancy brands.\"\n\nIt was very cool and pleasant in that dim wareroom, with the rafters\nshowing overhead in a cloudy perspective, and darkening away into the\nperpetual twilight at the rear of the building; and Bartley had found\nan agreeable seat on the head of a half-barrel of the paint, which he\nwas reluctant to leave.  But he rose and followed the vigorous lead of\nLapham back to the office, where the sun of a long summer afternoon was\njust beginning to glare in at the window.  On shelves opposite Lapham's\ndesk were tin cans of various sizes, arranged in tapering cylinders,\nand showing, in a pattern diminishing toward the top, the same label\nborne by the casks and barrels in the wareroom.  Lapham merely waved\nhis hand toward these; but when Bartley, after a comprehensive glance\nat them, gave his whole attention to a row of clean, smooth jars, where\ndifferent tints of the paint showed through flawless glass, Lapham\nsmiled, and waited in pleased expectation.\n\n\"Hello!\" said Bartley.  \"That's pretty!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" assented Lapham, \"it is rather nice.  It's our latest thing, and\nwe find it takes with customers first-rate. Look here!\" he said, taking\ndown one of the jars, and pointing to the first line of the label.\n\nBartley read, \"THE PERSIS BRAND,\" and then he looked at Lapham and\nsmiled.\n\n\"After HER, of course,\" said Lapham.  \"Got it up and put the first of\nit on the market her last birthday.  She was pleased.\"\n\n\"I should think she might have been,\" said Bartley, while he made a\nnote of the appearance of the jars.\n\n\"I don't know about your mentioning it in your interview,\" said Lapham\ndubiously.\n\n\"That's going into the interview, Mr. Lapham, if nothing else does.\nGot a wife myself, and I know just how you feel.\" It was in the dawn of\nBartley's prosperity on the Boston Events, before his troubles with\nMarcia had seriously begun.\n\n\"Is that so?\" said Lapham, recognising with a smile another of the vast\nmajority of married Americans; a few underrate their wives, but the\nrest think them supernal in intelligence and capability.  \"Well,\" he\nadded, \"we must see about that.  Where'd you say you lived?\"\n\n\"We don't live; we board.  Mrs. Nash, 13 Canary Place.\"\n\n\"Well, we've all got to commence that way,\" suggested Lapham\nconsolingly.\n\n\"Yes; but we've about got to the end of our string.  I expect to be\nunder a roof of my own on Clover Street before long.  I suppose,\" said\nBartley, returning to business, \"that you didn't let the grass grow\nunder your feet much after you found out what was in your paint-mine?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" answered Lapham, withdrawing his eyes from a long stare at\nBartley, in which he had been seeing himself a young man again, in the\nfirst days of his married life.  \"I went right back to Lumberville and\nsold out everything, and put all I could rake and scrape together into\npaint.  And Mis' Lapham was with me every time.  No hang back about\nHER.  I tell you she was a WOMAN!\"\n\nBartley laughed.  \"That's the sort most of us marry.\"\n\n\"No, we don't,\" said Lapham.  \"Most of us marry silly little girls\ngrown up to LOOK like women.\"\n\n\"Well, I guess that's about so,\" assented Bartley, as if upon second\nthought.\n\n\"If it hadn't been for her,\" resumed Lapham, \"the paint wouldn't have\ncome to anything.  I used to tell her it wa'n't the seventy-five per\ncent. of purr-ox-eyed of iron in the ORE that made that paint go; it\nwas the seventy-five per cent. of purr-ox-eyed of iron in HER.\"\n\n\"Good!\" cried Bartley.  \"I'll tell Marcia that.\"\n\n\"In less'n six months there wa'n't a board-fence, nor a bridge-girder,\nnor a dead wall, nor a barn, nor a face of rock in that whole region\nthat didn't have 'Lapham's Mineral Paint--Specimen' on it in the three\ncolours we begun by making.\" Bartley had taken his seat on the\nwindow-sill, and Lapham, standing before him, now put up his huge foot\nclose to Bartley's thigh; neither of them minded that.\n\n\"I've heard a good deal of talk about that S.T.--1860--X. man, and the\nstove-blacking man, and the kidney-cure man, because they advertised in\nthat way; and I've read articles about it in the papers; but I don't\nsee where the joke comes in, exactly.  So long as the people that own\nthe barns and fences don't object, I don't see what the public has got\nto do with it.  And I never saw anything so very sacred about a big\nrock, along a river or in a pasture, that it wouldn't do to put mineral\npaint on it in three colours.  I wish some of the people that talk\nabout the landscape, and WRITE about it, had to bu'st one of them rocks\nOUT of the landscape with powder, or dig a hole to bury it in, as we\nused to have to do up on the farm; I guess they'd sing a little\ndifferent tune about the profanation of scenery.  There ain't any man\nenjoys a sightly bit of nature--a smooth piece of interval with half a\ndozen good-sized wine-glass elms in it--more than I do.  But I ain't\na-going to stand up for every big ugly rock I come across, as if we\nwere all a set of dumn Druids.  I say the landscape was made for man,\nand not man for the landscape.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Bartley carelessly; \"it was made for the stove-polish man\nand the kidney-cure man.\"\n\n\"It was made for any man that knows how to use it,\" Lapham returned,\ninsensible to Bartley's irony.  \"Let 'em go and live with nature in the\nWINTER, up there along the Canada line, and I guess they'll get enough\nof her for one while.  Well--where was I?\"\n\n\"Decorating the landscape,\" said Bartley.\n\n\"Yes, sir; I started right there at Lumberville, and it give the place\na start too.  You won't find it on the map now; and you won't find it\nin the gazetteer.  I give a pretty good lump of money to build a\ntown-hall, about five years back, and the first meeting they held in it\nthey voted to change the name,--Lumberville WA'N'T a name,--and it's\nLapham now.\"\n\n\"Isn't it somewhere up in that region that they get the old Brandon\nred?\" asked Bartley.\n\n\"We're about ninety miles from Brandon.  The Brandon's a good paint,\"\nsaid Lapham conscientiously.  \"Like to show you round up at our place\nsome odd time, if you get off.\"\n\n\"Thanks.  I should like it first-rate.  WORKS there?\"\n\n\"Yes; works there.  Well, sir, just about the time I got started, the\nwar broke out; and it knocked my paint higher than a kite.  The thing\ndropped perfectly dead.  I presume that if I'd had any sort of\ninfluence, I might have got it into Government hands, for gun-carriages\nand army wagons, and may be on board Government vessels.  But I hadn't,\nand we had to face the music.  I was about broken-hearted, but m'wife\nshe looked at it another way.  'I guess it's a providence,' says she.\n'Silas, I guess you've got a country that's worth fighting for.  Any\nrate, you better go out and give it a chance.' Well, sir, I went.  I\nknew she meant business.  It might kill her to have me go, but it would\nkill her sure if I stayed.  She was one of that kind.  I went.  Her\nlast words was, 'I'll look after the paint, Si.' We hadn't but just one\nlittle girl then,--boy'd died,--and Mis' Lapham's mother was livin'\nwith us; and I knew if times DID anyways come up again, m'wife'd know\njust what to do.  So I went.  I got through; and you can call me\nColonel, if you want to.  Feel there!\" Lapham took Bartley's thumb and\nforefinger and put them on a bunch in his leg, just above the knee.\n\"Anything hard?\"\n\n\"Ball?\"\n\nLapham nodded.  \"Gettysburg. That's my thermometer.  If it wa'n't for\nthat, I shouldn't know enough to come in when it rains.\"\n\nBartley laughed at a joke which betrayed some evidences of wear.  \"And\nwhen you came back, you took hold of the paint and rushed it.\"\n\n\"I took hold of the paint and rushed it--all I could,\" said Lapham,\nwith less satisfaction than he had hitherto shown in his autobiography.\n\"But I found that I had got back to another world.  The day of small\nthings was past, and I don't suppose it will ever come again in this\ncountry.  My wife was at me all the time to take a partner--somebody\nwith capital; but I couldn't seem to bear the idea.  That paint was\nlike my own blood to me.  To have anybody else concerned in it was\nlike--well, I don't know what.  I saw it was the thing to do; but I\ntried to fight it off, and I tried to joke it off.  I used to say, 'Why\ndidn't you take a partner yourself, Persis, while I was away?' And\nshe'd say, 'Well, if you hadn't come back, I should, Si.' Always DID\nlike a joke about as well as any woman I ever saw.  Well, I had to come\nto it.  I took a partner.\" Lapham dropped the bold blue eyes with which\nhe had been till now staring into Bartley's face, and the reporter knew\nthat here was a place for asterisks in his interview, if interviews\nwere faithful.  \"He had money enough,\" continued Lapham, with a\nsuppressed sigh; \"but he didn't know anything about paint.  We hung on\ntogether for a year or two.  And then we quit.\"\n\n\"And he had the experience,\" suggested Bartley, with companionable ease.\n\n\"I had some of the experience too,\" said Lapham, with a scowl; and\nBartley divined, through the freemasonry of all who have sore places in\ntheir memories, that this was a point which he must not touch again.\n\n\"And since that, I suppose, you've played it alone.\"\n\n\"I've played it alone.\"\n\n\"You must ship some of this paint of yours to foreign countries,\nColonel?\" suggested Bartley, putting on a professional air.\n\n\"We ship it to all parts of the world.  It goes to South America, lots\nof it.  It goes to Australia, and it goes to India, and it goes to\nChina, and it goes to the Cape of Good Hope.  It'll stand any climate.\nOf course, we don't export these fancy brands much.  They're for home\nuse.  But we're introducing them elsewhere.  Here.\" Lapham pulled open\na drawer, and showed Bartley a lot of labels in different\nlanguages--Spanish, French, German, and Italian.  \"We expect to do a\ngood business in all those countries.  We've got our agencies in Cadiz\nnow, and in Paris, and in Hamburg, and in Leghorn.  It's a thing that's\nbound to make its way.  Yes, sir.  Wherever a man has got a ship, or a\nbridge, or a lock, or a house, or a car, or a fence, or a pig-pen\nanywhere in God's universe to paint, that's the paint for him, and he's\nbound to find it out sooner or later.  You pass a ton of that paint dry\nthrough a blast-furnace, and you'll get a quarter of a ton of pig-iron.\nI believe in my paint.  I believe it's a blessing to the world.  When\nfolks come in, and kind of smell round, and ask me what I mix it with,\nI always say, 'Well, in the first place, I mix it with FAITH, and after\nthat I grind it up with the best quality of boiled linseed oil that\nmoney will buy.'\"\n\nLapham took out his watch and looked at it, and Bartley perceived that\nhis audience was drawing to a close.  \"'F you ever want to run down and\ntake a look at our works, pass you over the road,\"--he called it\nRUD--\"and it sha'n't cost you a cent.\" \"Well, may be I shall,\nsometime,\" said Bartley.  \"Good afternoon, Colonel.\"\n\n\"Good afternoon.  Or--hold on! My horse down there yet, William?\" he\ncalled to the young man in the counting-room who had taken his letter\nat the beginning of the interview.  \"Oh! All right!\" he added, in\nresponse to something the young man said.\n\n\"Can't I set you down somewhere, Mr. Hubbard? I've got my horse at the\ndoor, and I can drop you on my way home.  I'm going to take Mis' Lapham\nto look at a house I'm driving piles for, down on the New Land.\"\n\n\"Don't care if I do,\" said Bartley.\n\nLapham put on a straw hat, gathered up some papers lying on his desk,\npulled down its rolling cover, turned the key in it, and gave the\npapers to an extremely handsome young woman at one of the desks in the\nouter office.  She was stylishly dressed, as Bartley saw, and her\nsmooth, yellow hair was sculpturesquely waved over a low, white\nforehead.  \"Here,\" said Lapham, with the same prompt gruff kindness\nthat he had used in addressing the young man, \"I want you should put\nthese in shape, and give me a type-writer copy to-morrow.\"\n\n\"What an uncommonly pretty girl!\" said Bartley, as they descended the\nrough stairway and found their way out to the street, past the dangling\nrope of a block and tackle wandering up into the cavernous darkness\noverhead.\n\n\"She does her work,\" said Lapham shortly.\n\nBartley mounted to the left side of the open buggy standing at the\ncurb-stone, and Lapham, gathering up the hitching-weight, slid it under\nthe buggy-seat and mounted beside him.\n\n\"No chance to speed a horse here, of course,\" said Lapham, while the\nhorse with a spirited gentleness picked her way, with a high, long\naction, over the pavement of the street.  The streets were all narrow,\nand most of them crooked, in that quarter of the town; but at the end\nof one the spars of a vessel pencilled themselves delicately against\nthe cool blue of the afternoon sky.  The air was full of a smell\npleasantly compounded of oakum, of leather, and of oil.  It was not the\nbusy season, and they met only two or three trucks heavily straggling\ntoward the wharf with their long string teams; but the cobble-stones of\nthe pavement were worn with the dint of ponderous wheels, and\ndiscoloured with iron-rust from them; here and there, in wandering\nstreaks over its surface, was the grey stain of the salt water with\nwhich the street had been sprinkled.\n\nAfter an interval of some minutes, which both men spent in looking\nround the dash-board from opposite sides to watch the stride of the\nhorse, Bartley said, with a light sigh, \"I had a colt once down in\nMaine that stepped just like that mare.\"\n\n\"Well!\" said Lapham, sympathetically recognising the bond that this\nfact created between them.  \"Well, now, I tell you what you do.  You\nlet me come for you 'most any afternoon, now, and take you out over the\nMilldam, and speed this mare a little.  I'd like to show you what this\nmare can do.  Yes, I would.\"\n\n\"All right,\" answered Bartley; \"I'll let you know my first day off.\"\n\n\"Good,\" cried Lapham.\n\n\"Kentucky?\" queried Bartley.\n\n\"No, sir.  I don't ride behind anything but Vermont; never did.  Touch\nof Morgan, of course; but you can't have much Morgan in a horse if you\nwant speed.  Hambletonian mostly.  Where'd you say you wanted to get\nout?\"\n\n\"I guess you may put me down at the Events Office, just round the\ncorner here.  I've got to write up this interview while it's fresh.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Lapham, impersonally assenting to Bartley's use of\nhim as material.\n\nHe had not much to complain of in Bartley's treatment, unless it was\nthe strain of extravagant compliment which it involved.  But the\nflattery was mainly for the paint, whose virtues Lapham did not believe\ncould be overstated, and himself and his history had been treated with\nas much respect as Bartley was capable of showing any one.  He made a\nvery picturesque thing of the discovery of the paint-mine. \"Deep in the\nheart of the virgin forests of Vermont, far up toward the line of the\nCanadian snows, on a desolate mountain-side, where an autumnal storm\nhad done its wild work, and the great trees, strewn hither and thither,\nbore witness to its violence, Nehemiah Lapham discovered, just forty\nyears ago, the mineral which the alchemy of his son's enterprise and\nenergy has transmuted into solid ingots of the most precious of metals.\nThe colossal fortune of Colonel Silas Lapham lay at the bottom of a\nhole which an uprooted tree had dug for him, and which for many years\nremained a paint-mine of no more appreciable value than a soap-mine.\"\n\nHere Bartley had not been able to forego another grin; but he\ncompensated for it by the high reverence with which he spoke of Colonel\nLapham's record during the war of the rebellion, and of the motives\nwhich impelled him to turn aside from an enterprise in which his whole\nheart was engaged, and take part in the struggle.  \"The Colonel bears\nembedded in the muscle of his right leg a little memento of the period\nin the shape of a minie-ball, which he jocularly referred to as his\nthermometer, and which relieves him from the necessity of reading 'The\nProbabilities' in his morning paper.  This saves him just so much time;\nand for a man who, as he said, has not a moment of waste time on him\nanywhere, five minutes a day are something in the course of a year.\nSimple, clear, bold, and straightforward in mind and action, Colonel\nSilas Lapham, with a prompt comprehensiveness and a never-failing\nbusiness sagacity, is, in the best sense of that much-abused term, one\nof nature's noblemen, to the last inch of his five eleven and a half.\nHis life affords an example of single-minded application and unwavering\nperseverance which our young business men would do well to emulate.\nThere is nothing showy or meretricious about the man.  He believes in\nmineral paint, and he puts his heart and soul into it.  He makes it a\nreligion; though we would not imply that it IS his religion.  Colonel\nLapham is a regular attendant at the Rev. Dr. Langworthy's church.  He\nsubscribes liberally to the Associated Charities, and no good object or\nworthy public enterprise fails to receive his support.  He is not now\nactively in politics, and his paint is not partisan; but it is an open\nsecret that he is, and always has been, a staunch Republican.  Without\nviolating the sanctities of private life, we cannot speak fully of\nvarious details which came out in the free and unembarrassed interview\nwhich Colonel Lapham accorded our representative.  But we may say that\nthe success of which he is justly proud he is also proud to attribute\nin great measure to the sympathy and energy of his wife--one of those\nwomen who, in whatever walk of life, seem born to honour the name of\nAmerican Woman, and to redeem it from the national reproach of Daisy\nMillerism.  Of Colonel Lapham's family, we will simply add that it\nconsists of two young lady daughters.\n\n\"The subject of this very inadequate sketch is building a house on the\nwater side of Beacon Street, after designs by one of our leading\narchitectural firms, which, when complete, will be one of the finest\nornaments of that exclusive avenue.  It will, we believe, be ready for\nthe occupancy of the family sometime in the spring.\"\n\nWhen Bartley had finished his article, which he did with a good deal of\ninward derision, he went home to Marcia, still smiling over the thought\nof Lapham, whose burly simplicity had peculiarly amused him.  \"He\nregularly turned himself inside out to me,\" he said, as he sat\ndescribing his interview to Marcia.\n\n\"Then I know you could make something nice out of it,\" said his wife;\n\"and that will please Mr. Witherby.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I've done pretty well; but I couldn't let myself loose on him\nthe way I wanted to.  Confound the limitations of decency, anyway! I\nshould like to have told just what Colonel Lapham thought of landscape\nadvertising in Colonel Lapham's own words.  I'll tell you one thing,\nMarsh: he had a girl there at one of the desks that you wouldn't let ME\nhave within gunshot of MY office.  Pretty? It ain't any name for it!\"\nMarcia's eyes began to blaze, and Bartley broke out into a laugh, in\nwhich he arrested himself at sight of a formidable parcel in the corner\nof the room.\n\n\"Hello! What's that?\"\n\n\"Why, I don't know what it is,\" replied Marcia tremulously.  \"A man\nbrought it just before you came in, and I didn't like to open it.\"\n\n\"Think it was some kind of infernal machine?\" asked Bartley, getting\ndown on his knees to examine the package.  \"MRS. B. Hubbard, heigh?\" He\ncut the heavy hemp string with his penknife.  \"We must look into this\nthing.  I should like to know who's sending packages to Mrs. Hubbard in\nmy absence.\" He unfolded the wrappings of paper, growing softer and\nfiner inward, and presently pulled out a handsome square glass jar,\nthrough which a crimson mass showed richly.  \"The Persis Brand!\" he\nyelled.  \"I knew it!\"\n\n\"Oh, what is it, Bartley?\" quavered Marcia.  Then, courageously drawing\na little nearer: \"Is it some kind of jam?\" she implored.  \"Jam? No!\"\nroared Bartley.  \"It's PAINT! It's mineral paint--Lapham's paint!\"\n\n\"Paint?\" echoed Marcia, as she stood over him while he stripped their\nwrappings from the jars which showed the dark blue, dark green, light\nbrown, dark brown, and black, with the dark crimson, forming the gamut\nof colour of the Lapham paint.  \"Don't TELL me it's paint that I can\nuse, Bartley!\"\n\n\"Well, I shouldn't advise you to use much of it--all at once,\" replied\nher husband.  \"But it's paint that you can use in moderation.\"\n\nMarcia cast her arms round his neck and kissed him.  \"O Bartley, I\nthink I'm the happiest girl in the world!  I was just wondering what I\nshould do.  There are places in that Clover Street house that need\ntouching up so dreadfully.  I shall be very careful.  You needn't be\nafraid I shall overdo.  But, this just saves my life.  Did you BUY it,\nBartley? You know we couldn't afford it, and you oughtn't to have done\nit! And what does the Persis Brand mean?\"\n\n\"Buy it?\" cried Bartley.  \"No! The old fool's sent it to you as a\npresent.  You'd better wait for the facts before you pitch into me for\nextravagance, Marcia.  Persis is the name of his wife; and he named it\nafter her because it's his finest brand.  You'll see it in my\ninterview.  Put it on the market her last birthday for a surprise to\nher.\"\n\n\"What old fool?\" faltered Marcia.\n\n\"Why, Lapham--the mineral paint man.\"\n\n\"Oh, what a good man!\" sighed Marcia from the bottom of her soul.\n\"Bartley! you WON'T make fun of him as you do of some of those people?\nWILL you?\"\n\n\"Nothing that HE'LL ever find out,\" said Bartley, getting up and\nbrushing off the carpet-lint from his knees.\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\nAFTER dropping Bartley Hubbard at the Events building, Lapham drove on\ndown Washington Street to Nankeen Square at the South End, where he had\nlived ever since the mistaken movement of society in that direction\nceased.  He had not built, but had bought very cheap of a terrified\ngentleman of good extraction who discovered too late that the South End\nwas not the thing, and who in the eagerness of his flight to the Back\nBay threw in his carpets and shades for almost nothing.  Mrs. Lapham\nwas even better satisfied with their bargain than the Colonel himself,\nand they had lived in Nankeen Square for twelve years.  They had seen\nthe saplings planted in the pretty oval round which the houses were\nbuilt flourish up into sturdy young trees, and their two little girls\nin the same period had grown into young ladies; the Colonel's tough\nframe had expanded into the bulk which Bartley's interview indicated;\nand Mrs. Lapham, while keeping a more youthful outline, showed the\nsharp print of the crow's-foot at the corners of her motherly eyes, and\ncertain slight creases in her wholesome cheeks.  The fact that they\nlived in an unfashionable neighbourhood was something that they had\nnever been made to feel to their personal disadvantage, and they had\nhardly known it till the summer before this story opens, when Mrs.\nLapham and her daughter Irene had met some other Bostonians far from\nBoston, who made it memorable.  They were people whom chance had\nbrought for the time under a singular obligation to the Lapham ladies,\nand they were gratefully recognisant of it.  They had ventured--a\nmother and two daughters--as far as a rather wild little Canadian\nwatering-place on the St. Lawrence, below Quebec, and had arrived some\ndays before their son and brother was expected to join them.  Two of\ntheir trunks had gone astray, and on the night of their arrival the\nmother was taken violently ill.  Mrs. Lapham came to their help, with\nher skill as nurse, and with the abundance of her own and her\ndaughter's wardrobe, and a profuse, single-hearted kindness.  When a\ndoctor could be got at, he said that but for Mrs. Lapham's timely care,\nthe lady would hardly have lived.  He was a very effusive little\nFrenchman, and fancied he was saying something very pleasant to\neverybody.\n\nA certain intimacy inevitably followed, and when the son came he was\neven more grateful than the others.  Mrs. Lapham could not quite\nunderstand why he should be as attentive to her as to Irene; but she\ncompared him with other young men about the place, and thought him\nnicer than any of them.  She had not the means of a wider comparison;\nfor in Boston, with all her husband's prosperity, they had not had a\nsocial life.  Their first years there were given to careful getting on\nLapham's part, and careful saving on his wife's.  Suddenly the money\nbegan to come so abundantly that she need not save; and then they did\nnot know what to do with it.  A certain amount could be spent on\nhorses, and Lapham spent it; his wife spent on rich and rather ugly\nclothes and a luxury of household appointments.  Lapham had not yet\nreached the picture-buying stage of the rich man's development, but\nthey decorated their house with the costliest and most abominable\nfrescoes; they went upon journeys, and lavished upon cars and hotels;\nthey gave with both hands to their church and to all the charities it\nbrought them acquainted with; but they did not know how to spend on\nsociety.  Up to a certain period Mrs. Lapham had the ladies of her\nneighbourhood in to tea, as her mother had done in the country in her\nyounger days.  Lapham's idea of hospitality was still to bring a\nheavy-buying customer home to pot-luck; neither of them imagined\ndinners.\n\nTheir two girls had gone to the public schools, where they had not got\non as fast as some of the other girls; so that they were a year behind\nin graduating from the grammar-school, where Lapham thought that they\nhad got education enough.  His wife was of a different mind; she would\nhave liked them to go to some private school for their finishing.  But\nIrene did not care for study; she preferred house-keeping, and both the\nsisters were afraid of being snubbed by the other girls, who were of a\ndifferent sort from the girls of the grammar-school; these were mostly\nfrom the parks and squares, like themselves.  It ended in their going\npart of a year.  But the elder had an odd taste of her own for reading,\nand she took some private lessons, and read books out of the\ncirculating library; the whole family were amazed at the number she\nread, and rather proud of it.\n\nThey were not girls who embroidered or abandoned themselves to\nneedle-work. Irene spent her abundant leisure in shopping for herself\nand her mother, of whom both daughters made a kind of idol, buying her\ncaps and laces out of their pin-money, and getting her dresses far\nbeyond her capacity to wear.  Irene dressed herself very stylishly, and\nspent hours on her toilet every day.  Her sister had a simpler taste,\nand, if she had done altogether as she liked, might even have slighted\ndress.  They all three took long naps every day, and sat hours together\nminutely discussing what they saw out of the window.  In her\nself-guided search for self-improvement, the elder sister went to many\nchurch lectures on a vast variety of secular subjects, and usually came\nhome with a comic account of them, and that made more matter of talk\nfor the whole family.  She could make fun of nearly everything; Irene\ncomplained that she scared away the young men whom they got acquainted\nwith at the dancing-school sociables.  They were, perhaps, not the\nwisest young men.\n\nThe girls had learned to dance at Papanti's; but they had not belonged\nto the private classes.  They did not even know of them, and a great\ngulf divided them from those who did.  Their father did not like\ncompany, except such as came informally in their way; and their mother\nhad remained too rustic to know how to attract it in the sophisticated\ncity fashion.  None of them had grasped the idea of European travel;\nbut they had gone about to mountain and sea-side resorts, the mother\nand the two girls, where they witnessed the spectacle which such\nresorts present throughout New England, of multitudes of girls, lovely,\naccomplished, exquisitely dressed, humbly glad of the presence of any\nsort of young man; but the Laphams had no skill or courage to make\nthemselves noticed, far less courted by the solitary invalid, or\nclergyman, or artist.  They lurked helplessly about in the hotel\nparlours, looking on and not knowing how to put themselves forward.\nPerhaps they did not care a great deal to do so.  They had not a\nconceit of themselves, but a sort of content in their own ways that one\nmay notice in certain families.  The very strength of their mutual\naffection was a barrier to worldly knowledge; they dressed for one\nanother; they equipped their house for their own satisfaction; they\nlived richly to themselves, not because they were selfish, but because\nthey did not know how to do otherwise.  The elder daughter did not care\nfor society, apparently.  The younger, who was but three years younger,\nwas not yet quite old enough to be ambitious of it.  With all her\nwonderful beauty, she had an innocence almost vegetable.  When her\nbeauty, which in its immaturity was crude and harsh, suddenly ripened,\nshe bloomed and glowed with the unconsciousness of a flower; she not\nmerely did not feel herself admired, but hardly knew herself\ndiscovered.  If she dressed well, perhaps too well, it was because she\nhad the instinct of dress; but till she met this young man who was so\nnice to her at Baie St. Paul, she had scarcely lived a detached,\nindividual life, so wholly had she depended on her mother and her\nsister for her opinions, almost her sensations.  She took account of\neverything he did and said, pondering it, and trying to make out\nexactly what he meant, to the inflection of a syllable, the slightest\nmovement or gesture.  In this way she began for the first time to form\nideas which she had not derived from her family, and they were none the\nless her own because they were often mistaken.\n\nSome of the things that he partly said, partly looked, she reported to\nher mother, and they talked them over, as they did everything relating\nto these new acquaintances, and wrought them into the novel point of\nview which they were acquiring.  When Mrs. Lapham returned home, she\nsubmitted all the accumulated facts of the case, and all her own\nconjectures, to her husband, and canvassed them anew.\n\nAt first he was disposed to regard the whole affair as of small\nimportance, and she had to insist a little beyond her own convictions\nin order to counteract his indifference.\n\n\"Well, I can tell you,\" she said, \"that if you think they were not the\nnicest people you ever saw, you're mightily mistaken.  They had about\nthe best manners; and they had been everywhere, and knew everything.  I\ndeclare it made me feel as if we had always lived in the backwoods.  I\ndon't know but the mother and the daughters would have let you feel so\na little, if they'd showed out all they thought; but they never did;\nand the son--well, I can't express it, Silas! But that young man had\nabout perfect ways.\"\n\n\"Seem struck up on Irene?\" asked the Colonel.\n\n\"How can I tell? He seemed just about as much struck up on me.  Anyway,\nhe paid me as much attention as he did her.  Perhaps it's more the way,\nnow, to notice the mother than it used to be.\"\n\nLapham ventured no conjecture, but asked, as he had asked already, who\nthe people were.\n\nMrs. Lapham repeated their name.  Lapham nodded his head.  \"Do you know\nthem? What business is he in?\"\n\n\"I guess he ain't in anything,\" said Lapham.\n\n\"They were very nice,\" said Mrs. Lapham impartially.\n\n\"Well, they'd ought to be,\" returned the Colonel.  \"Never done anything\nelse.\"\n\n\"They didn't seem stuck up,\" urged his wife.\n\n\"They'd no need to--with you.  I could buy him and sell him, twice\nover.\"\n\nThis answer satisfied Mrs. Lapham rather with the fact than with her\nhusband.  \"Well, I guess I wouldn't brag, Silas,\" she said.\n\nIn the winter the ladies of this family, who returned to town very\nlate, came to call on Mrs. Lapham.  They were again very polite.  But\nthe mother let drop, in apology for their calling almost at nightfall,\nthat the coachman had not known the way exactly.\n\n\"Nearly all our friends are on the New Land or on the Hill.\"\n\nThere was a barb in this that rankled after the ladies had gone; and on\ncomparing notes with her daughter, Mrs. Lapham found that a barb had\nbeen left to rankle in her mind also.\n\n\"They said they had never been in this part of the town before.\"\n\nUpon a strict search of her memory, Irene could not report that the\nfact had been stated with anything like insinuation, but it was that\nwhich gave it a more penetrating effect.\n\n\"Oh, well, of course,\" said Lapham, to whom these facts were referred.\n\"Those sort of people haven't got much business up our way, and they\ndon't come.  It's a fair thing all round.  We don't trouble the Hill or\nthe New Land much.\"\n\n\"We know where they are,\" suggested his wife thoughtfully.\n\n\"Yes,\" assented the Colonel.  \"I know where they are.  I've got a lot\nof land over on the Back Bay.\"\n\n\"You have?\" eagerly demanded his wife.\n\n\"Want me to build on it?\" he asked in reply, with a quizzical smile.\n\n\"I guess we can get along here for a while.\"\n\nThis was at night.  In the morning Mrs. Lapham said--\n\n\"I suppose we ought to do the best we can for the children, in every\nway.\"\n\n\"I supposed we always had,\" replied her husband.\n\n\"Yes, we have, according to our light.\"\n\n\"Have you got some new light?\"\n\n\"I don't know as it's light.  But if the girls are going to keep on\nliving in Boston and marry here, I presume we ought to try to get them\ninto society, some way; or ought to do something.\"\n\n\"Well, who's ever done more for their children than we have?\" demanded\nLapham, with a pang at the thought that he could possibly have been\nout-done. \"Don't they have everything they want? Don't they dress just\nas you say? Don't you go everywhere with 'em? Is there ever anything\ngoing on that's worth while that they don't see it or hear it? I don't\nknow what you mean.  Why don't you get them into society? There's money\nenough!\"\n\n\"There's got to be something besides money, I guess,\" said Mrs. Lapham,\nwith a hopeless sigh.  \"I presume we didn't go to work just the right\nway about their schooling.  We ought to have got them into some school\nwhere they'd have got acquainted with city girls--girls who could help\nthem along.\"\n\n\"Nearly everybody at Miss Smillie's was from some where else.\"\n\n\"Well, it's pretty late to think about that now,\" grumbled Lapham.\n\n\"And we've always gone our own way, and not looked out for the future.\nWe ought to have gone out more, and had people come to the house.\nNobody comes.\"\n\n\"Well, is that my fault? I guess nobody ever makes people welcomer.\"\n\n\"We ought to have invited company more.\"\n\n\"Why don't you do it now? If it's for the girls, I don't care if you\nhave the house full all the while.\"\n\nMrs. Lapham was forced to a confession full of humiliation.  \"I don't\nknow who to ask.\"\n\n\"Well, you can't expect me to tell you.\"\n\n\"No; we're both country people, and we've kept our country ways, and we\ndon't, either of us, know what to do.  You've had to work so hard, and\nyour luck was so long coming, and then it came with such a rush, that\nwe haven't had any chance to learn what to do with it.  It's just the\nsame with Irene's looks; I didn't expect she was ever going to have\nany, she WAS such a plain child, and, all at once, she's blazed out\nthis way.  As long as it was Pen that didn't seem to care for society,\nI didn't give much mind to it.  But I can see it's going to be\ndifferent with Irene.  I don't believe but what we're in the wrong\nneighbourhood.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the Colonel, \"there ain't a prettier lot on the Back Bay\nthan mine.  It's on the water side of Beacon, and it's twenty-eight\nfeet wide and a hundred and fifty deep.  Let's build on it.\"\n\nMrs. Lapham was silent a while.  \"No,\" she said finally; \"we've always\ngot along well enough here, and I guess we better stay.\"\n\nAt breakfast she said casually: \"Girls, how would you like to have your\nfather build on the New Land?\"\n\nThe girls said they did not know.  It was more convenient to the\nhorse-cars where they were.\n\nMrs. Lapham stole a look of relief at her husband, and nothing more was\nsaid of the matter.\n\nThe mother of the family who had called upon Mrs. Lapham brought her\nhusband's cards, and when Mrs. Lapham returned the visit she was in\nsome trouble about the proper form of acknowledging the civility.  The\nColonel had no card but a business card, which advertised the principal\ndepot and the several agencies of the mineral paint; and Mrs. Lapham\ndoubted, till she wished to goodness that she had never seen nor heard\nof those people, whether to ignore her husband in the transaction\naltogether, or to write his name on her own card.  She decided finally\nupon this measure, and she had the relief of not finding the family at\nhome.  As far as she could judge, Irene seemed to suffer a little\ndisappointment from the fact.\n\nFor several months there was no communication between the families.\nThen there came to Nankeen Square a lithographed circular from the\npeople on the Hill, signed in ink by the mother, and affording Mrs.\nLapham an opportunity to subscribe for a charity of undeniable merit\nand acceptability.  She submitted it to her husband, who promptly drew\na cheque for five hundred dollars.\n\nShe tore it in two.  \"I will take a cheque for a hundred, Silas,\" she\nsaid.\n\n\"Why?\" he asked, looking up guiltily at her.\n\n\"Because a hundred is enough; and I don't want to show off before them.\"\n\n\"Oh, I thought may be you did.  Well, Pert,\" he added, having satisfied\nhuman nature by the preliminary thrust, \"I guess you're about right.\nWhen do you want I should begin to build on Beacon Street?\" He handed\nher the new cheque, where she stood over him, and then leaned back in\nhis chair and looked up at her.\n\n\"I don't want you should begin at all.  What do you mean, Silas?\" She\nrested against the side of his desk.\n\n\"Well, I don't know as I mean anything.  But shouldn't you like to\nbuild? Everybody builds, at least once in a lifetime.\"\n\n\"Where is your lot? They say it's unhealthy, over there.\"\n\nUp to a certain point in their prosperity Mrs. Lapham had kept strict\naccount of all her husband's affairs; but as they expanded, and ceased\nto be of the retail nature with which women successfully grapple, the\nintimate knowledge of them made her nervous.  There was a period in\nwhich she felt that they were being ruined, but the crash had not come;\nand, since his great success, she had abandoned herself to a blind\nconfidence in her husband's judgment, which she had hitherto felt\nneeded her revision.  He came and went, day by day, unquestioned.  He\nbought and sold and got gain.  She knew that he would tell her if ever\nthings went wrong, and he knew that she would ask him whenever she was\nanxious.\n\n\"It ain't unhealthy where I've bought,\" said Lapham, rather enjoying\nher insinuation.  \"I looked after that when I was trading; and I guess\nit's about as healthy on the Back Bay as it is here, anyway.  I got\nthat lot for you, Pert; I thought you'd want to build on the Back Bay\nsome day.\"\n\n\"Pshaw!\" said Mrs. Lapham, deeply pleased inwardly, but not going to\nshow it, as she would have said.  \"I guess you want to build there\nyourself.\" She insensibly got a little nearer to her husband.  They\nliked to talk to each other in that blunt way; it is the New England\nway of expressing perfect confidence and tenderness.\n\n\"Well, I guess I do,\" said Lapham, not insisting upon the unselfish\nview of the matter.  \"I always did like the water side of Beacon.\nThere ain't a sightlier place in the world for a house.  And some day\nthere's bound to be a drive-way all along behind them houses, between\nthem and the water, and then a lot there is going to be worth the gold\nthat will cover it--COIN.  I've had offers for that lot, Pert, twice\nover what I give for it.  Yes, I have.  Don't you want to ride over\nthere some afternoon with me and see it?\" \"I'm satisfied where we be,\nSi,\" said Mrs. Lapham, recurring to the parlance of her youth in her\npathos at her husband's kindness.  She sighed anxiously, for she felt\nthe trouble a woman knows in view of any great change.  They had often\ntalked of altering over the house in which they lived, but they had\nnever come to it; and they had often talked of building, but it had\nalways been a house in the country that they had thought of.  \"I wish\nyou had sold that lot.\"\n\n\"I hain't,\" said the colonel briefly.\n\n\"I don't know as I feel much like changing our way of living.\"\n\n\"Guess we could live there pretty much as we live here.  There's all\nkinds of people on Beacon Street; you mustn't think they're all\nbig-bugs. I know one party that lives in a house he built to sell, and\nhis wife don't keep any girl.  You can have just as much style there as\nyou want, or just as little.  I guess we live as well as most of 'em\nnow, and set as good a table.  And if you come to style, I don't know\nas anybody has got more of a right to put it on than what we have.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't want to build on Beacon Street, Si,\" said Mrs. Lapham\ngently.\n\n\"Just as you please, Persis.  I ain't in any hurry to leave.\"\n\nMrs. Lapham stood flapping the cheque which she held in her right hand\nagainst the edge of her left.\n\nThe Colonel still sat looking up at her face, and watching the effect\nof the poison of ambition which he had artfully instilled into her mind.\n\nShe sighed again--a yielding sigh.  \"What are you going to do this\nafternoon?\"\n\n\"I'm going to take a turn on the Brighton road,\" said the Colonel.\n\n\"I don't believe but what I should like to go along,\" said his wife.\n\n\"All right.  You hain't ever rode behind that mare yet, Pert, and I\nwant you should see me let her out once.  They say the snow's all\npacked down already, and the going is A 1.\"\n\nAt four o'clock in the afternoon, with a cold, red winter sunset before\nthem, the Colonel and his wife were driving slowly down Beacon Street\nin the light, high-seated cutter, where, as he said, they were a pretty\ntight fit.  He was holding the mare in till the time came to speed her,\nand the mare was springily jolting over the snow, looking intelligently\nfrom side to side, and cocking this ear and that, while from her\nnostrils, her head tossing easily, she blew quick, irregular whiffs of\nsteam.\n\n\"Gay, ain't she?\" proudly suggested the Colonel.\n\n\"She IS gay,\" assented his wife.\n\nThey met swiftly dashing sleighs, and let them pass on either hand,\ndown the beautiful avenue narrowing with an admirably even sky-line in\nthe perspective.  They were not in a hurry.  The mare jounced easily\nalong, and they talked of the different houses on either side of the\nway.  They had a crude taste in architecture, and they admired the\nworst.  There were women's faces at many of the handsome windows, and\nonce in a while a young man on the pavement caught his hat suddenly\nfrom his head, and bowed in response to some salutation from within.\n\n\"I don't think our girls would look very bad behind one of those big\npanes,\" said the Colonel.\n\n\"No,\" said his wife dreamily.\n\n\"Where's the YOUNG man? Did he come with them?\"\n\n\"No; he was to spend the winter with a friend of his that has a ranch\nin Texas.  I guess he's got to do something.\"\n\n\"Yes; gentlemaning as a profession has got to play out in a generation\nor two.\"\n\nNeither of them spoke of the lot, though Lapham knew perfectly well\nwhat his wife had come with him for, and she was aware that he knew it.\nThe time came when he brought the mare down to a walk, and then slowed\nup almost to a stop, while they both turned their heads to the right\nand looked at the vacant lot, through which showed the frozen stretch\nof the Back Bay, a section of the Long Bridge, and the roofs and\nsmoke-stacks of Charlestown.\n\n\"Yes, it's sightly,\" said Mrs. Lapham, lifting her hand from the reins,\non which she had unconsciously laid it.\n\nLapham said nothing, but he let the mare out a little.\n\nThe sleighs and cutters were thickening round them.  On the Milldam it\nbecame difficult to restrict the mare to the long, slow trot into which\nhe let her break.  The beautiful landscape widened to right and left of\nthem, with the sunset redder and redder, over the low, irregular hills\nbefore them.  They crossed the Milldam into Longwood; and here, from\nthe crest of the first upland, stretched two endless lines, in which\nthousands of cutters went and came.  Some of the drivers were already\nspeeding their horses, and these shot to and fro on inner lines,\nbetween the slowly moving vehicles on either side of the road.  Here\nand there a burly mounted policeman, bulging over the pommel of his\nM'Clellan saddle, jolted by, silently gesturing and directing the\ncourse, and keeping it all under the eye of the law.  It was what\nBartley Hubbard called \"a carnival of fashion and gaiety on the\nBrighton road,\" in his account of it.  But most of the people in those\nelegant sleighs and cutters had so little the air of the great world\nthat one knowing it at all must have wondered where they and their\nmoney came from; and the gaiety of the men, at least, was expressed,\nlike that of Colonel Lapham, in a grim almost fierce, alertness; the\nwomen wore an air of courageous apprehension.  At a certain point the\nColonel said, \"I'm going to let her out, Pert,\" and he lifted and then\ndropped the reins lightly on the mare's back.\n\nShe understood the signal, and, as an admirer said, \"she laid down to\nher work.\" Nothing in the immutable iron of Lapham's face betrayed his\nsense of triumph as the mare left everything behind her on the road.\nMrs. Lapham, if she felt fear, was too busy holding her flying wraps\nabout her, and shielding her face from the scud of ice flung from the\nmare's heels, to betray it; except for the rush of her feet, the mare\nwas as silent as the people behind her; the muscles of her back and\nthighs worked more and more swiftly, like some mechanism responding to\nan alien force, and she shot to the end of the course, grazing a\nhundred encountered and rival sledges in her passage, but unmolested by\nthe policemen, who probably saw that the mare and the Colonel knew what\nthey were about, and, at any rate, were not the sort of men to\ninterfere with trotting like that.  At the end of the heat Lapham drew\nher in, and turned off on a side street into Brookline.\n\n\"Tell you what, Pert,\" he said, as if they had been quietly jogging\nalong, with time for uninterrupted thought since he last spoke, \"I've\nabout made up my mind to build on that lot.\"\n\n\"All right, Silas,\" said Mrs. Lapham; \"I suppose you know what you're\nabout.  Don't build on it for me, that's all.\"\n\nWhen she stood in the hall at home, taking off her things, she said to\nthe girls, who were helping her, \"Some day your father will get killed\nwith that mare.\"\n\n\"Did he speed her?\" asked Penelope, the elder.\n\nShe was named after her grandmother, who had in her turn inherited from\nanother ancestress the name of the Homeric matron whose peculiar merits\nwon her a place even among the Puritan Faiths, Hopes, Temperances, and\nPrudences.  Penelope was the girl whose odd serious face had struck\nBartley Hubbard in the photograph of the family group Lapham showed him\non the day of the interview.  Her large eyes, like her hair, were\nbrown; they had the peculiar look of near-sighted eyes which is called\nmooning; her complexion was of a dark pallor.\n\nHer mother did not reply to a question which might be considered\nalready answered.  \"He says he's going to build on that lot of his,\"\nshe next remarked, unwinding the long veil which she had tied round her\nneck to hold her bonnet on.  She put her hat and cloak on the hall\ntable, to be carried upstairs later, and they all went in to tea:\ncreamed oysters, birds, hot biscuit, two kinds of cake, and dishes of\nstewed and canned fruit and honey.  The women dined alone at one, and\nthe Colonel at the same hour down-town. But he liked a good hot meal\nwhen he got home in the evening.  The house flared with gas; and the\nColonel, before he sat down, went about shutting the registers, through\nwhich a welding heat came voluming up from the furnace.\n\n\"I'll be the death of that darkey YET,\" he said, \"if he don't stop\nmaking on such a fire.  The only way to get any comfort out of your\nfurnace is to take care of it yourself.\"\n\n\"Well,\" answered his wife from behind the teapot, as he sat down at\ntable with this threat, \"there's nothing to prevent you, Si.  And you\ncan shovel the snow too, if you want to--till you get over to Beacon\nStreet, anyway.\"\n\n\"I guess I can keep my own sidewalk on Beacon Street clean, if I take\nthe notion.\"\n\n\"I should like to see you at it,\" retorted his wife.\n\n\"Well, you keep a sharp lookout, and may be you will.\"\n\nTheir taunts were really expressions of affectionate pride in each\nother.  They liked to have it, give and take, that way, as they would\nhave said, right along.\n\n\"A man can be a man on Beacon Street as well as anywhere, I guess.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll do the wash, as I used to in Lumberville,\" said Mrs.\nLapham.  \"I presume you'll let me have set tubs, Si.  You know I ain't\nso young any more.\" She passed Irene a cup of Oolong tea,--none of them\nhad a sufficiently cultivated palate for Sou-chong,--and the girl\nhanded it to her father.  \"Papa,\" she asked, \"you don't really mean\nthat you're going to build over there?\"\n\n\"Don't I? You wait and see,\" said the Colonel, stirring his tea.\n\n\"I don't believe you do,\" pursued the girl.\n\n\"Is that so? I presume you'd hate to have me.  Your mother does.\" He\nsaid DOOS, of course.\n\nPenelope took the word.  \"I go in for it.  I don't see any use in not\nenjoying money, if you've got it to enjoy.  That's what it's for, I\nsuppose; though you mightn't always think so.\" She had a slow, quaint\nway of talking, that seemed a pleasant personal modification of some\nancestral Yankee drawl, and her voice was low and cozy, and so far from\nbeing nasal that it was a little hoarse.\n\n\"I guess the ayes has it, Pen,\" said her father.  \"How would it do to\nlet Irene and your mother stick in the old place here, and us go into\nthe new house?\" At times the Colonel's grammar failed him.\n\nThe matter dropped, and the Laphams lived on as before, with joking\nrecurrences to the house on the water side of Beacon.  The Colonel\nseemed less in earnest than any of them about it; but that was his way,\nhis girls said; you never could tell when he really meant a thing.\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nTOWARD the end of the winter there came a newspaper, addressed to Miss\nIrene Lapham; it proved to be a Texas newspaper, with a complimentary\naccount of the ranch of the Hon. Loring G. Stanton, which the\nrepresentative of the journal had visited.\n\n\"It must be his friend,\" said Mrs. Lapham, to whom her daughter brought\nthe paper; \"the one he's staying with.\"\n\nThe girl did not say anything, but she carried the paper to her room,\nwhere she scanned every line of it for another name.  She did not find\nit, but she cut the notice out and stuck it into the side of her\nmirror, where she could read it every morning when she brushed her\nhair, and the last thing at night when she looked at herself in the\nglass just before turning off the gas.  Her sister often read it aloud,\nstanding behind her and rendering it with elocutionary effects.\n\n\"The first time I ever heard of a love-letter in the form of a puff to\na cattle-ranch. But perhaps that's the style on the Hill.\"\n\nMrs. Lapham told her husband of the arrival of the paper, treating the\nfact with an importance that he refused to see in it.\n\n\"How do you know the fellow sent it, anyway?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Oh, I know he did.\"\n\n\"I don't see why he couldn't write to 'Rene, if he really meant\nanything.\"\n\n\"Well, I guess that wouldn't be their way,\" said Mrs. Lapham; she did\nnot at all know what their way would be.\n\nWhen the spring opened Colonel Lapham showed that he had been in\nearnest about building on the New Land.  His idea of a house was a\nbrown-stone front, four stories high, and a French roof with an\nair-chamber above.  Inside, there was to be a reception-room on the\nstreet and a dining-room back.  The parlours were to be on the second\nfloor, and finished in black walnut or party-coloured paint.  The\nchambers were to be on the three floors above, front and rear, with\nside-rooms over the front door.  Black walnut was to be used everywhere\nexcept in the attic, which was to be painted and grained to look like\nblack walnut.  The whole was to be very high-studded, and there were to\nbe handsome cornices and elaborate centre-pieces throughout, except,\nagain, in the attic.\n\nThese ideas he had formed from the inspection of many new buildings\nwhich he had seen going up, and which he had a passion for looking\ninto.  He was confirmed in his ideas by a master builder who had put up\na great many houses on the Back Bay as a speculation, and who told him\nthat if he wanted to have a house in the style, that was the way to\nhave it.\n\nThe beginnings of the process by which Lapham escaped from the master\nbuilder and ended in the hands of an architect are so obscure that it\nwould be almost impossible to trace them.  But it all happened, and\nLapham promptly developed his ideas of black walnut finish, high\nstudding, and cornices.  The architect was able to conceal the shudder\nwhich they must have sent through him.  He was skilful, as nearly all\narchitects are, in playing upon that simple instrument Man.  He began\nto touch Colonel Lapham's stops.\n\n\"Oh, certainly, have the parlours high-studded. But you've seen some of\nthose pretty old-fashioned country-houses, haven't you, where the\nentrance-story is very low-studded?\" \"Yes,\" Lapham assented.\n\n\"Well, don't you think something of that kind would have a very nice\neffect? Have the entrance-story low-studded, and your parlours on the\nnext floor as high as you please.  Put your little reception-room here\nbeside the door, and get the whole width of your house frontage for a\nsquare hall, and an easy low-tread staircase running up three sides of\nit.  I'm sure Mrs. Lapham would find it much pleasanter.\" The architect\ncaught toward him a scrap of paper lying on the table at which they\nwere sitting and sketched his idea.  \"Then have your dining-room behind\nthe hall, looking on the water.\"\n\nHe glanced at Mrs. Lapham, who said, \"Of course,\" and the architect\nwent on--\n\n\"That gets you rid of one of those long, straight, ugly\nstaircases,\"--until that moment Lapham had thought a long, straight\nstaircase the chief ornament of a house,--\"and gives you an effect of\namplitude and space.\"\n\n\"That's so!\" said Mrs. Lapham.  Her husband merely made a noise in his\nthroat.\n\n\"Then, were you thinking of having your parlours together, connected by\nfolding doors?\" asked the architect deferentially.\n\n\"Yes, of course,\" said Lapham.  \"They're always so, ain't they?\"\n\n\"Well, nearly,\" said the architect.  \"I was wondering how would it do\nto make one large square room at the front, taking the whole breadth of\nthe house, and, with this hall-space between, have a music-room back\nfor the young ladies?\"\n\nLapham looked helplessly at his wife, whose quicker apprehension had\nfollowed the architect's pencil with instant sympathy.  \"First-rate!\"\nshe cried.\n\nThe Colonel gave way.  \"I guess that would do.  It'll be kind of odd,\nwon't it?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know,\" said the architect.  \"Not so odd, I hope, as the\nother thing will be a few years from now.\" He went on to plan the rest\nof the house, and he showed himself such a master in regard to all the\npractical details that Mrs. Lapham began to feel a motherly affection\nfor the young man, and her husband could not deny in his heart that the\nfellow seemed to understand his business.  He stopped walking about the\nroom, as he had begun to do when the architect and Mrs. Lapham entered\ninto the particulars of closets, drainage, kitchen arrangements, and\nall that, and came back to the table.  \"I presume,\" he said, \"you'll\nhave the drawing-room finished in black walnut?\"\n\n\"Well, yes,\" replied the architect, \"if you like.  But some less\nexpensive wood can be made just as effective with paint.  Of course you\ncan paint black walnut too.\"\n\n\"Paint it?\" gasped the Colonel.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the architect quietly.  \"White, or a little off white.\"\n\nLapham dropped the plan he had picked up from the table.  His wife made\na little move toward him of consolation or support.\n\n\"Of course,\" resumed the architect, \"I know there has been a great\ncraze for black walnut.  But it's an ugly wood; and for a drawing-room\nthere is really nothing like white paint.  We should want to introduce\na little gold here and there.  Perhaps we might run a painted frieze\nround under the cornice--garlands of roses on a gold ground; it would\ntell wonderfully in a white room.\"\n\nThe Colonel returned less courageously to the charge.  \"I presume\nyou'll want Eastlake mantel-shelves and tiles?\" He meant this for a\nsarcastic thrust at a prevailing foible of the profession.\n\n\"Well, no,\" gently answered the architect.  \"I was thinking perhaps a\nwhite marble chimney-piece, treated in the refined Empire style, would\nbe the thing for that room.\"\n\n\"White marble!\" exclaimed the Colonel.  \"I thought that had gone out\nlong ago.\"\n\n\"Really beautiful things can't go out.  They may disappear for a little\nwhile, but they must come back.  It's only the ugly things that stay\nout after they've had their day.\"\n\nLapham could only venture very modestly, \"Hard-wood floors?\"\n\n\"In the music-room, of course,\" consented the architect.\n\n\"And in the drawing-room?\"\n\n\"Carpet. Some sort of moquette, I should say.  But I should prefer to\nconsult Mrs. Lapham's taste in that matter.\"\n\n\"And in the other rooms?\"\n\n\"Oh, carpets, of course.\"\n\n\"And what about the stairs?\"\n\n\"Carpet. And I should have the rail and banisters white--banisters\nturned or twisted.\"\n\nThe Colonel said under his breath, \"Well, I'm dumned!\" but he gave no\nutterance to his astonishment in the architect's presence.  When he\nwent at last,--the session did not end till eleven o'clock,--Lapham\nsaid, \"Well, Pert, I guess that fellow's fifty years behind, or ten\nyears ahead.  I wonder what the Ongpeer style is?\"\n\n\"I don't know.  I hated to ask.  But he seemed to understand what he\nwas talking about.  I declare, he knows what a woman wants in a house\nbetter than she does herself.\"\n\n\"And a man's simply nowhere in comparison,\" said Lapham.  But he\nrespected a fellow who could beat him at every point, and have a reason\nready, as this architect had; and when he recovered from the daze into\nwhich the complete upheaval of all his preconceived notions had left\nhim, he was in a fit state to swear by the architect.  It seemed to him\nthat he had discovered the fellow (as he always called him) and owned\nhim now, and the fellow did nothing to disturb this impression.  He\nentered into that brief but intense intimacy with the Laphams which the\nsympathetic architect holds with his clients.  He was privy to all\ntheir differences of opinion and all their disputes about the house.\nHe knew just where to insist upon his own ideas, and where to yield.\nHe was really building several other houses, but he gave the Laphams\nthe impression that he was doing none but theirs.\n\nThe work was not begun till the frost was thoroughly out of the ground,\nwhich that year was not before the end of April.  Even then it did not\nproceed very rapidly.  Lapham said they might as well take their time\nto it; if they got the walls up and the thing closed in before the snow\nflew, they could be working at it all winter.  It was found necessary\nto dig for the kitchen; at that point the original salt-marsh lay near\nthe surface, and before they began to put in the piles for the\nfoundation they had to pump.  The neighbourhood smelt like the hold of\na ship after a three years' voyage.  People who had cast their fortunes\nwith the New Land went by professing not to notice it; people who still\n\"hung on to the Hill\" put their handkerchiefs to their noses, and told\neach other the old terrible stories of the material used in filling up\nthe Back Bay.\n\nNothing gave Lapham so much satisfaction in the whole construction of\nhis house as the pile-driving. When this began, early in the summer, he\ntook Mrs. Lapham every day in his buggy and drove round to look at it;\nstopping the mare in front of the lot, and watching the operation with\neven keener interest than the little loafing Irish boys who\nsuperintended it in force.  It pleased him to hear the portable engine\nchuckle out a hundred thin whiffs of steam in carrying the big iron\nweight to the top of the framework above the pile, then seem to\nhesitate, and cough once or twice in pressing the weight against the\ndetaching apparatus.  There was a moment in which the weight had the\neffect of poising before it fell; then it dropped with a mighty whack\non the iron-bound head of the pile, and drove it a foot into the earth.\n\n\"By gracious!\" he would say, \"there ain't anything like that in THIS\nworld for BUSINESS, Persis!\"\n\nMrs. Lapham suffered him to enjoy the sight twenty or thirty times\nbefore she said, \"Well, now drive on, Si.\"\n\nBy the time the foundation was in and the brick walls had begun to go\nup, there were so few people left in the neighbourhood that she might\nindulge with impunity her husband's passion for having her clamber over\nthe floor-timbers and the skeleton stair-cases with him.  Many of the\nhouseholders had boarded up their front doors before the buds had begun\nto swell and the assessor to appear in early May; others had followed\nsoon; and Mrs. Lapham was as safe from remark as if she had been in the\ndepth of the country.  Ordinarily she and her girls left town early in\nJuly, going to one of the hotels at Nantasket, where it was convenient\nfor the Colonel to get to and from his business by the boat.  But this\nsummer they were all lingering a few weeks later, under the novel\nfascination of the new house, as they called it, as if there were no\nother in the world.\n\nLapham drove there with his wife after he had set Bartley Hubbard down\nat the Events office, but on this day something happened that\ninterfered with the solid pleasure they usually took in going over the\nhouse.  As the Colonel turned from casting anchor at the mare's head\nwith the hitching-weight, after helping his wife to alight, he\nencountered a man to whom he could not help speaking, though the man\nseemed to share his hesitation if not his reluctance at the necessity.\nHe was a tallish, thin man, with a dust-coloured face, and a dead,\nclerical air, which somehow suggested at once feebleness and tenacity.\n\nMrs. Lapham held out her hand to him.\n\n\"Why, Mr. Rogers!\" she exclaimed; and then, turning toward her husband,\nseemed to refer the two men to each other.  They shook hands, but\nLapham did not speak.  \"I didn't know you were in Boston,\" pursued Mrs.\nLapham.  \"Is Mrs. Rogers with you?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Mr. Rogers, with a voice which had the flat, succinct sound\nof two pieces of wood clapped together.  \"Mrs. Rogers is still in\nChicago.\"\n\nA little silence followed, and then Mrs Lapham said--\n\n\"I presume you are quite settled out there.\"\n\n\"No; we have left Chicago.  Mrs. Rogers has merely remained to finish\nup a little packing.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed! Are you coming back to Boston?\"\n\n\"I cannot say as yet.  We sometimes think of so doing.\"\n\nLapham turned away and looked up at the building.  His wife pulled a\nlittle at her glove, as if embarrassed, or even pained.  She tried to\nmake a diversion.\n\n\"We are building a house,\" she said, with a meaningless laugh.\n\n\"Oh, indeed,\" said Mr. Rogers, looking up at it.\n\nThen no one spoke again, and she said helplessly--\n\n\"If you come to Boston, I hope I shall see Mrs. Rogers.\"\n\n\"She will be happy to have you call,\" said Mr Rogers.\n\nHe touched his hat-brim, and made a bow forward rather than in Mrs.\nLapham's direction.\n\nShe mounted the planking that led into the shelter of the bare brick\nwalls, and her husband slowly followed.  When she turned her face\ntoward him her cheeks were burning, and tears that looked hot stood in\nher eyes.\n\n\"You left it all to me!\" she cried.  \"Why couldn't you speak a word?\"\n\n\"I hadn't anything to say to him,\" replied Lapham sullenly.\n\nThey stood a while, without looking at the work which they had come to\nenjoy, and without speaking to each other.\n\n\"I suppose we might as well go on,\" said Mrs. Lapham at last, as they\nreturned to the buggy.  The Colonel drove recklessly toward the\nMilldam.  His wife kept her veil down and her face turned from him.\nAfter a time she put her handkerchief up under her veil and wiped her\neyes, and he set his teeth and squared his jaw.\n\n\"I don't see how he always manages to appear just at the moment when he\nseems to have gone fairly out of our lives, and blight everything,\" she\nwhimpered.\n\n\"I supposed he was dead,\" said Lapham.\n\n\"Oh, don't SAY such a thing! It sounds as if you wished it.\"\n\n\"Why do you mind it? What do you let him blight everything for?\"\n\n\"I can't help it, and I don't believe I ever shall.  I don't know as\nhis being dead would help it any.  I can't ever see him without feeling\njust as I did at first.\"\n\n\"I tell you,\" said Lapham, \"it was a perfectly square thing.  And I\nwish, once for all, you would quit bothering about it.  My conscience\nis easy as far as he is concerned, and it always was.\"\n\n\"And I can't look at him without feeling as if you'd ruined him, Silas.\"\n\n\"Don't look at him, then,\" said her husband, with a scowl.  \"I want you\nshould recollect in the first place, Persis, that I never wanted a\npartner.\"\n\n\"If he hadn't put his money in when he did, you'd 'a' broken down.\"\n\n\"Well, he got his money out again, and more, too,\" said the Colonel,\nwith a sulky weariness.\n\n\"He didn't want to take it out.\"\n\n\"I gave him his choice: buy out or go out.\"\n\n\"You know he couldn't buy out then.  It was no choice at all.\"\n\n\"It was a business chance.\"\n\n\"No; you had better face the truth, Silas.  It was no chance at all.\nYou crowded him out.  A man that had saved you! No, you had got greedy,\nSilas.  You had made your paint your god, and you couldn't bear to let\nanybody else share in its blessings.\"\n\n\"I tell you he was a drag and a brake on me from the word go.  You say\nhe saved me.  Well, if I hadn't got him out he'd 'a' ruined me sooner\nor later.  So it's an even thing, as far forth as that goes.\"\n\n\"No, it ain't an even thing, and you know it, Silas.  Oh, if I could\nonly get you once to acknowledge that you did wrong about it, then I\nshould have some hope.  I don't say you meant wrong exactly, but you\ntook an advantage.  Yes, you took an advantage! You had him where he\ncouldn't help himself, and then you wouldn't show him any mercy.\"\n\n\"I'm sick of this,\" said Lapham.  \"If you'll 'tend to the house, I'll\nmanage my business without your help.\"\n\n\"You were very glad of my help once.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm tired of it now.  Don't meddle.\"\n\n\"I WILL meddle.  When I see you hardening yourself in a wrong thing,\nit's time for me to meddle, as you call it, and I will.  I can't ever\nget you to own up the least bit about Rogers, and I feel as if it was\nhurting you all the while.\"\n\n\"What do you want I should own up about a thing for when I don't feel\nwrong? I tell you Rogers hain't got anything to complain of, and that's\nwhat I told you from the start.  It's a thing that's done every day.  I\nwas loaded up with a partner that didn't know anything, and couldn't do\nanything, and I unloaded; that's all.\"\n\n\"You unloaded just at the time when you knew that your paint was going\nto be worth about twice what it ever had been; and you wanted all the\nadvantage for yourself.\"\n\n\"I had a right to it.  I made the success.\"\n\n\"Yes, you made it with Rogers's money; and when you'd made it you took\nhis share of it.  I guess you thought of that when you saw him, and\nthat's why you couldn't look him in the face.\"\n\nAt these words Lapham lost his temper.\n\n\"I guess you don't want to ride with me any more to-day,\" he said,\nturning the mare abruptly round.\n\n\"I'm as ready to go back as what you are,\" replied his wife.  \"And\ndon't you ask me to go to that house with you any more.  You can sell\nit, for all me.  I sha'n't live in it.  There's blood on it.\"\n\n\n\nIV.\n\n\nTHE silken texture of the marriage tie bears a daily strain of wrong\nand insult to which no other human relation can be subjected without\nlesion; and sometimes the strength that knits society together might\nappear to the eye of faltering faith the curse of those immediately\nbound by it.  Two people by no means reckless of each other's rights\nand feelings, but even tender of them for the most part, may tear at\neach other's heart-strings in this sacred bond with perfect impunity;\nthough if they were any other two they would not speak or look at each\nother again after the outrages they exchange.  It is certainly a\ncurious spectacle, and doubtless it ought to convince an observer of\nthe divinity of the institution.  If the husband and wife are blunt,\noutspoken people like the Laphams, they do not weigh their words; if\nthey are more refined, they weigh them very carefully, and know\naccurately just how far they will carry, and in what most sensitive\nspot they may be planted with most effect.\n\nLapham was proud of his wife, and when he married her it had been a\nrise in life for him.  For a while he stood in awe of his good fortune,\nbut this could not last, and he simply remained supremely satisfied\nwith it.  The girl who had taught school with a clear head and a strong\nhand was not afraid of work; she encouraged and helped him from the\nfirst, and bore her full share of the common burden.  She had health,\nand she did not worry his life out with peevish complaints and\nvagaries; she had sense and principle, and in their simple lot she did\nwhat was wise and right.  Their marriage was hallowed by an early\nsorrow: they lost their boy, and it was years before they could look\neach other in the face and speak of him.  No one gave up more than they\nwhen they gave up each other and Lapham went to the war.  When he came\nback and began to work, her zeal and courage formed the spring of his\nenterprise.  In that affair of the partnership she had tried to be his\nconscience, but perhaps she would have defended him if he had accused\nhimself; it was one of those things in this life which seem destined to\nawait justice, or at least judgment, in the next.  As he said, Lapham\nhad dealt fairly by his partner in money; he had let Rogers take more\nmoney out of the business than he put into it; he had, as he said,\nsimply forced out of it a timid and inefficient participant in\nadvantages which he had created.  But Lapham had not created them all.\nHe had been dependent at one time on his partner's capital.  It was a\nmoment of terrible trial.  Happy is the man for ever after who can\nchoose the ideal, the unselfish part in such an exigency! Lapham could\nnot rise to it.  He did what he could maintain to be perfectly fair.\nThe wrong, if any, seemed to be condoned to him, except when from time\nto time his wife brought it up.  Then all the question stung and burned\nanew, and had to be reasoned out and put away once more.  It seemed to\nhave an inextinguishable vitality.  It slept, but it did not die.\n\nHis course did not shake Mrs. Lapham's faith in him.  It astonished her\nat first, and it always grieved her that he could not see that he was\nacting solely in his own interest.  But she found excuses for him,\nwhich at times she made reproaches.  She vaguely perceived that his\npaint was something more than business to him; it was a sentiment,\nalmost a passion.  He could not share its management and its profit\nwith another without a measure of self-sacrifice far beyond that which\nhe must make with something less personal to him.  It was the poetry of\nthat nature, otherwise so intensely prosaic; and she understood this,\nand for the most part forbore.  She knew him good and true and\nblameless in all his life, except for this wrong, if it were a wrong;\nand it was only when her nerves tingled intolerably with some chance\nrenewal of the pain she had suffered, that she shared her anguish with\nhim in true wifely fashion.\n\nWith those two there was never anything like an explicit\nreconciliation.  They simply ignored a quarrel; and Mrs. Lapham had\nonly to say a few days after at breakfast, \"I guess the girls would\nlike to go round with you this afternoon, and look at the new house,\"\nin order to make her husband grumble out as he looked down into his\ncoffee-cup. \"I guess we better all go, hadn't we?\"\n\n\"Well, I'll see,\" she said.\n\nThere was not really a great deal to look at when Lapham arrived on the\nground in his four-seated beach-wagon.  But the walls were up, and the\nstudding had already given skeleton shape to the interior.  The floors\nwere roughly boarded over, and the stairways were in place, with\nprovisional treads rudely laid.  They had not begun to lath and plaster\nyet, but the clean, fresh smell of the mortar in the walls mingling\nwith the pungent fragrance of the pine shavings neutralised the\nVenetian odour that drew in over the water.  It was pleasantly shady\nthere, though for the matter of that the heat of the morning had all\nbeen washed out of the atmosphere by a tide of east wind setting in at\nnoon, and the thrilling, delicious cool of a Boston summer afternoon\nbathed every nerve.\n\nThe foreman went about with Mrs. Lapham, showing her where the doors\nwere to be; but Lapham soon tired of this, and having found a pine\nstick of perfect grain, he abandoned himself to the pleasure of\nwhittling it in what was to be the reception-room, where he sat looking\nout on the street from what was to be the bay-window. Here he was\npresently joined by his girls, who, after locating their own room on\nthe water side above the music-room, had no more wish to enter into\ndetails than their father.\n\n\"Come and take a seat in the bay-window, ladies,\" he called out to\nthem, as they looked in at him through the ribs of the wall.  He\njocosely made room for them on the trestle on which he sat.\n\nThey came gingerly and vaguely forward, as young ladies do when they\nwish not to seem to be going to do a thing they have made up their\nminds to do.  When they had taken their places on their trestle, they\ncould not help laughing with scorn, open and acceptable to their\nfather; and Irene curled her chin up, in a little way she had, and\nsaid, \"How ridiculous!\" to her sister.\n\n\"Well, I can tell you what,\" said the Colonel, in fond enjoyment of\ntheir young ladyishness, \"your mother wa'n't ashamed to sit with me on\na trestle when I called her out to look at the first coat of my paint\nthat I ever tried on a house.\"\n\n\"Yes; we've heard that story,\" said Penelope, with easy security of her\nfather's liking what she said.  \"We were brought up on that story.\"\n\n\"Well, it's a good story,\" said her father.\n\nAt that moment a young man came suddenly in range, who began to look up\nat the signs of building as he approached.  He dropped his eyes in\ncoming abreast of the bay-window, where Lapham sat with his girls, and\nthen his face lightened, and he took off his hat and bowed to Irene.\nShe rose mechanically from the trestle, and her face lightened too.\n\nShe was a very pretty figure of a girl, after our fashion of girls,\nround and slim and flexible, and her face was admirably regular.  But\nher great beauty--and it was very great--was in her colouring.  This\nwas of an effect for which there is no word but delicious, as we use it\nof fruit or flowers.  She had red hair, like her father in his earlier\ndays, and the tints of her cheeks and temples were such as suggested\nMay-flowers and apple-blossoms and peaches.  Instead of the grey that\noften dulls this complexion, her eyes were of a blue at once intense\nand tender, and they seemed to burn on what they looked at with a soft,\nlambent flame.  It was well understood by her sister and mother that\nher eyes always expressed a great deal more than Irene ever thought or\nfelt; but this is not saying that she was not a very sensible girl and\nvery honest.\n\nThe young man faltered perceptibly, and Irene came a little forward,\nand then there gushed from them both a smiling exchange of greeting, of\nwhich the sum was that he supposed she was out of town, and that she\nhad not known that he had got back.  A pause ensued, and flushing again\nin her uncertainty as to whether she ought or ought not to do it, she\nsaid, \"My father, Mr. Corey; and my sister.\"\n\nThe young man took off his hat again, showing his shapely head, with a\nline of wholesome sunburn ceasing where the recently and closely\nclipped hair began.  He was dressed in a fine summer check, with a blue\nwhite-dotted neckerchief, and he had a white hat, in which he looked\nvery well when he put it back on his head.  His whole dress seemed very\nfresh and new, and in fact he had cast aside his Texan habiliments only\nthe day before.\n\n\"How do you do, sir?\" said the Colonel, stepping to the window, and\nreaching out of it the hand which the young man advanced to take.\n\"Won't you come in? We're at home here.  House I'm building.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed?\" returned the young man; and he came promptly up the\nsteps, and through its ribs into the reception-room.\n\n\"Have a trestle?\" asked the Colonel, while the girls exchanged little\nshocks of terror and amusement at the eyes.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said the young man simply, and sat down.\n\n\"Mrs. Lapham is upstairs interviewing the carpenter, but she'll be down\nin a minute.\"\n\n\"I hope she's quite well,\" said Corey.  \"I supposed--I was afraid she\nmight be out of town.\"\n\n\"Well, we are off to Nantasket next week.  The house kept us in town\npretty late.\"\n\n\"It must be very exciting, building a house,\" said Corey to the elder\nsister.\n\n\"Yes, it is,\" she assented, loyally refusing in Irene's interest the\nopportunity of saying anything more.\n\nCorey turned to the latter.  \"I suppose you've all helped to plan it?\"\n\n\"Oh no; the architect and mamma did that.\"\n\n\"But they allowed the rest of us to agree, when we were good,\" said\nPenelope.\n\nCorey looked at her, and saw that she was shorter than her sister, and\nhad a dark complexion.\n\n\"It's very exciting,\" said Irene.\n\n\"Come up,\" said the Colonel, rising, \"and look round if you'd like to.\"\n\n\"I should like to, very much,\" said the young man.  He helped the young\nladies over crevasses of carpentry and along narrow paths of planking,\non which they had made their way unassisted before.  The elder sister\nleft the younger to profit solely by these offices as much as possible.\nShe walked between them and her father, who went before, lecturing on\neach apartment, and taking the credit of the whole affair more and more\nas he talked on.\n\n\"There!\" he said, \"we're going to throw out a bay-window here, so as\nget the water all the way up and down.  This is my girls' room,\" he\nadded, looking proudly at them both.\n\nIt seemed terribly intimate.  Irene blushed deeply and turned her head\naway.\n\nBut the young man took it all, apparently, as simply as their father.\n\"What a lovely lookout!\" he said.  The Back Bay spread its glassy sheet\nbefore them, empty but for a few small boats and a large schooner, with\nher sails close-furled and dripping like snow from her spars, which a\ntug was rapidly towing toward Cambridge.  The carpentry of that city,\nembanked and embowered in foliage, shared the picturesqueness of\nCharlestown in the distance.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Lapham, \"I go in for using the best rooms in your house\nyourself.  If people come to stay with you, they can put up with the\nsecond best.  Though we don't intend to have any second best.  There\nain't going to be an unpleasant room in the whole house, from top to\nbottom.\"\n\n\"Oh, I wish papa wouldn't brag so!\" breathed Irene to her sister, where\nthey stood, a little apart, looking away together.\n\nThe Colonel went on.  \"No, sir,\" he swelled out, \"I have gone in for\nmaking a regular job of it.  I've got the best architect in Boston, and\nI'm building a house to suit myself.  And if money can do it, guess I'm\ngoing to be suited.\"\n\n\"It seems very delightful,\" said Corey, \"and very original.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.  That fellow hadn't talked five minutes before I saw that he\nknew what he was about every time.\"\n\n\"I wish mamma would come!\" breathed Irene again.  \"I shall certainly go\nthrough the floor if papa says anything more.\"\n\n\"They are making a great many very pretty houses nowadays,\" said the\nyoung man.  \"It's very different from the old-fashioned building.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the Colonel, with a large toleration of tone and a deep\nbreath that expanded his ample chest, \"we spend more on our houses\nnowadays.  I started out to build a forty-thousand-dollar house.  Well,\nsir! that fellow has got me in for more than sixty thousand already,\nand I doubt if I get out of it much under a hundred.  You can't have a\nnice house for nothing.  It's just like ordering a picture of a\npainter.  You pay him enough, and he can afford to paint you a\nfirst-class picture; and if you don't, he can't. That's all there is of\nit.  Why, they tell me that A. T. Stewart gave one of those French\nfellows sixty thousand dollars for a little seven-by-nine picture the\nother day.  Yes, sir, give an architect money enough, and he'll give\nyou a nice house every time.\"\n\n\"I've heard that they're sharp at getting money to realise their\nideas,\" assented the young man, with a laugh.\n\n\"Well, I should say so!\" exclaimed the Colonel.  \"They come to you with\nan improvement that you can't resist.  It has good looks and\ncommon-sense and everything in its favour, and it's like throwing money\naway to refuse.  And they always manage to get you when your wife is\naround, and then you're helpless.\"\n\nThe Colonel himself set the example of laughing at this joke, and the\nyoung man joined him less obstreperously.  The girls turned, and he\nsaid, \"I don't think I ever saw this view to better advantage.  It's\nsurprising how well the Memorial Hall and the Cambridge spires work up,\nover there.  And the sunsets must be magnificent.\"\n\nLapham did not wait for them to reply.\n\n\"Yes, sir, it's about the sightliest view I know of.  I always did like\nthe water side of Beacon.  Long before I owned property here, or ever\nexpected to, m'wife and I used to ride down this way, and stop the\nbuggy to get this view over the water.  When people talk to me about\nthe Hill, I can understand 'em. It's snug, and it's old-fashioned, and\nit's where they've always lived.  But when they talk about Commonwealth\nAvenue, I don't know what they mean.  It don't hold a candle to the\nwater side of Beacon.  You've got just as much wind over there, and\nyou've got just as much dust, and all the view you've got is the view\nacross the street.  No, sir! when you come to the Back Bay at all, give\nme the water side of Beacon.\"\n\n\"Oh, I think you're quite right,\" said the young man.  \"The view here\nis everything.\"\n\nIrene looked \"I wonder what papa is going to say next!\" at her sister,\nwhen their mother's voice was heard overhead, approaching the opening\nin the floor where the stairs were to be; and she presently appeared,\nwith one substantial foot a long way ahead.  She was followed by the\ncarpenter, with his rule sticking out of his overalls pocket, and she\nwas still talking to him about some measurements they had been taking,\nwhen they reached the bottom, so that Irene had to say, \"Mamma, Mr.\nCorey,\" before Mrs. Lapham was aware of him.\n\nHe came forward with as much grace and speed as the uncertain footing\nwould allow, and Mrs. Lapham gave him a stout squeeze of her\ncomfortable hand.\n\n\"Why, Mr. Corey! When did you get back?\"\n\n\"Yesterday. It hardly seems as if I HAD got back.  I didn't expect to\nfind you in a new house.\"\n\n\"Well, you are our first caller.  I presume you won't expect I should\nmake excuses for the state you find it in.  Has the Colonel been doing\nthe honours?\"\n\n\"Oh yes.  And I've seen more of your house than I ever shall again, I\nsuppose.\"\n\n\"Well, I hope not,\" said Lapham.  \"There'll be several chances to see\nus in the old one yet, before we leave.\"\n\nHe probably thought this a neat, off-hand way of making the invitation,\nfor he looked at his woman-kind as if he might expect their admiration.\n\n\"Oh yes, indeed!\" said his wife.  \"We shall be very glad to see Mr.\nCorey, any time.\"\n\n\"Thank you; I shall be glad to come.\"\n\nHe and the Colonel went before, and helped the ladies down the\ndifficult descent.  Irene seemed less sure-footed than the others; she\nclung to the young man's hand an imperceptible moment longer than need\nbe, or else he detained her.  He found opportunity of saying, \"It's so\npleasant seeing you again,\" adding, \"all of you.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said the girl.  \"They must all be glad to have you at home\nagain.\"\n\nCorey laughed.\n\n\"Well, I suppose they would be, if they were at home to have me.  But\nthe fact is, there's nobody in the house but my father and myself, and\nI'm only on my way to Bar Harbour.\"\n\n\"Oh! Are they there?\"\n\n\"Yes; it seems to be the only place where my mother can get just the\ncombination of sea and mountain air that she wants.\"\n\n\"We go to Nantasket--it's convenient for papa; and I don't believe we\nshall go anywhere else this summer, mamma's so taken up with building.\nWe do nothing but talk house; and Pen says we eat and sleep house.  She\nsays it would be a sort of relief to go and live in tents for a while.\"\n\n\"She seems to have a good deal of humour,\" the young man ventured, upon\nthe slender evidence.\n\nThe others had gone to the back of the house a moment, to look at some\nsuggested change.  Irene and Corey were left standing in the doorway.\nA lovely light of happiness played over her face and etherealised its\ndelicious beauty.  She had some ado to keep herself from smiling\noutright, and the effort deepened the dimples in her cheeks; she\ntrembled a little, and the pendants shook in the tips of her pretty\nears.\n\nThe others came back directly, and they all descended the front steps\ntogether.  The Colonel was about to renew his invitation, but he caught\nhis wife's eye, and, without being able to interpret its warning\nexactly, was able to arrest himself, and went about gathering up the\nhitching-weight, while the young man handed the ladies into the\nphaeton.  Then he lifted his hat, and the ladies all bowed, and the\nLaphams drove off, Irene's blue ribbons fluttering backward from her\nhat, as if they were her clinging thoughts.\n\n\"So that's young Corey, is it?\" said the Colonel, letting the stately\nstepping, tall coupe horse make his way homeward at will with the\nbeach-wagon. \"Well, he ain't a bad-looking fellow, and he's got a good,\nfair and square, honest eye.  But I don't see how a fellow like that,\nthat's had every advantage in this world, can hang round home and let\nhis father support him.  Seems to me, if I had his health and his\neducation, I should want to strike out and do something for myself.\"\n\nThe girls on the back seat had hold of each other's hands, and they\nexchanged electrical pressures at the different points their father\nmade.\n\n\"I presume,\" said Mrs. Lapham, \"that he was down in Texas looking after\nsomething.\"\n\n\"He's come back without finding it, I guess.\"\n\n\"Well, if his father has the money to support him, and don't complain\nof the burden, I don't see why WE should.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know it's none of my business, but I don't like the principle.\nI like to see a man ACT like a man.  I don't like to see him taken care\nof like a young lady.  Now, I suppose that fellow belongs to two or\nthree clubs, and hangs around 'em all day, lookin' out the\nwindow,--I've seen 'em,--instead of tryin' to hunt up something to do\nfor an honest livin'.\"\n\n\"If I was a young man,\" Penelope struck in, \"I would belong to twenty\nclubs, if I could find them and I would hang around them all, and look\nout the window till I dropped.\"\n\n\"Oh, you would, would you?\" demanded her father, delighted with her\ndefiance, and twisting his fat head around over his shoulder to look at\nher.  \"Well, you wouldn't do it on my money, if you were a son of MINE,\nyoung lady.\"\n\n\"Oh, you wait and see,\" retorted the girl.\n\nThis made them all laugh.  But the Colonel recurred seriously to the\nsubject that night, as he was winding up his watch preparatory to\nputting it under his pillow.\n\n\"I could make a man of that fellow, if I had him in the business with\nme.  There's stuff in him.  But I spoke up the way I did because I\ndidn't choose Irene should think I would stand any kind of a loafer\n'round--I don't care who he is, or how well educated or brought up.\nAnd I guess, from the way Pen spoke up, that 'Rene saw what I was\ndriving at.\"\n\nThe girl, apparently, was less anxious about her father's ideas and\nprinciples than about the impression which he had made upon the young\nman.  She had talked it over and over with her sister before they went\nto bed, and she asked in despair, as she stood looking at Penelope\nbrushing out her hair before the glass--\n\n\"Do you suppose he'll think papa always talks in that bragging way?\"\n\n\"He'll be right if he does,\" answered her sister.  \"It's the way father\nalways does talk.  You never noticed it so much, that's all.  And I\nguess if he can't make allowance for father's bragging, he'll be a\nlittle too good.  I enjoyed hearing the Colonel go on.\"\n\n\"I know you did,\" returned Irene in distress.  Then she sighed.\n\"Didn't you think he looked very nice?\"\n\n\"Who? The Colonel?\" Penelope had caught up the habit of calling her\nfather so from her mother, and she used his title in all her jocose and\nperverse moods.\n\n\"You know very well I don't mean papa,\" pouted Irene.  \"Oh! Mr. Corey!\nWhy didn't you say Mr. Corey if you meant Mr. Corey? If I meant Mr.\nCorey, I should say Mr. Corey.  It isn't swearing! Corey, Corey, Co----\"\n\nHer sister clapped her hand over her mouth \"Will you HUSH, you wretched\nthing?\" she whimpered.  \"The whole house can hear you.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, they can hear me all over the square.  Well, I think he looked\nwell enough for a plain youth, who hadn't taken his hair out of\ncurl-papers for some time.\"\n\n\"It WAS clipped pretty close,\" Irene admitted; and they both laughed at\nthe drab effect of Mr. Corey's skull, as they remembered it.  \"Did you\nlike his nose?\" asked Irene timorously.\n\n\"Ah, now you're COMING to something,\" said Penelope.  \"I don't know\nwhether, if I had so much of a nose, I should want it all Roman.\"\n\n\"I don't see how you can expect to have a nose part one kind and part\nanother,\" argued Irene.\n\n\"Oh, I do.  Look at mine!\" She turned aside her face, so as to get a\nthree-quarters view of her nose in the glass, and crossing her hands,\nwith the brush in one of them, before her, regarded it judicially.\n\"Now, my nose started Grecian, but changed its mind before it got over\nthe bridge, and concluded to be snub the rest of the way.\"\n\n\"You've got a very pretty nose, Pen,\" said Irene, joining in the\ncontemplation of its reflex in the glass.\n\n\"Don't say that in hopes of getting me to compliment HIS, Mrs.\"--she\nstopped, and then added deliberately--\"C.!\"\n\nIrene also had her hair-brush in her hand, and now she sprang at her\nsister and beat her very softly on the shoulder with the flat of it.\n\"You mean thing!\" she cried, between her shut teeth, blushing hotly.\n\n\"Well, D., then,\" said Penelope.  \"You've nothing to say against D.?\nThough I think C. is just as nice an initial.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried the younger, for all expression of unspeakable things.\n\n\"I think he has very good eyes,\" admitted Penelope.\n\n\"Oh, he HAS! And didn't you like the way his sackcoat set? So close to\nhim, and yet free--kind of peeling away at the lapels?\"\n\n\"Yes, I should say he was a young man of great judgment.  He knows how\nto choose his tailor.\"\n\nIrene sat down on the edge of a chair.  \"It was so nice of you, Pen, to\ncome in, that way, about clubs.\"\n\n\"Oh, I didn't mean anything by it except opposition,\" said Penelope.\n\"I couldn't have father swelling on so, without saying something.\"\n\n\"How he did swell!\" sighed Irene.  \"Wasn't it a relief to have mamma\ncome down, even if she did seem to be all stocking at first?\"\n\nThe girls broke into a wild giggle, and hid their faces in each other's\nnecks.  \"I thought I SHOULD die,\" said Irene.\n\n\"'It's just like ordering a painting,'\" said Penelope, recalling her\nfather's talk, with an effect of dreamy absent-mindedness. \"'You give\nthe painter money enough, and he can afford to paint you a first-class\npicture.  Give an architect money enough, and he'll give you a\nfirst-class house, every time.'\"\n\n\"Oh, wasn't it awful!\" moaned her sister.  \"No one would ever have\nsupposed that he had fought the very idea of an architect for weeks,\nbefore he gave in.\"\n\nPenelope went on.  \"'I always did like the water side of Beacon,--long\nbefore I owned property there.  When you come to the Back Bay at all,\ngive me the water side of Beacon.'\"\n\n\"Ow-w-w-w!\" shrieked Irene.  \"DO stop!\"\n\nThe door of their mother's chamber opened below, and the voice of the\nreal Colonel called, \"What are you doing up there, girls? Why don't you\ngo to bed?\"\n\nThis extorted nervous shrieks from both of them.  The Colonel heard a\nsound of scurrying feet, whisking drapery, and slamming doors.  Then he\nheard one of the doors opened again, and Penelope said, \"I was only\nrepeating something you said when you talked to Mr. Corey.\"\n\n\"Very well, now,\" answered the Colonel.  \"You postpone the rest of it\ntill to-morrow at breakfast, and see that you're up in time to let ME\nhear it.\"\n\n\n\nV.\n\n\nAT the same moment young Corey let himself in at his own door with his\nlatch-key, and went to the library, where he found his father turning\nthe last leaves of a story in the Revue des Deux Mondes.  He was a\nwhite-moustached old gentleman, who had never been able to abandon his\npince-nez for the superior comfort of spectacles, even in the privacy\nof his own library.  He knocked the glasses off as his son came in and\nlooked up at him with lazy fondness, rubbing the two red marks that\nthey always leave on the side of the nose.\n\n\"Tom,\" he said, \"where did you get such good clothes?\"\n\n\"I stopped over a day in New York,\" replied the son, finding himself a\nchair.  \"I'm glad you like them.\"\n\n\"Yes, I always do like your clothes, Tom,\" returned the father\nthoughtfully, swinging his glasses, \"But I don't see how you can afford\n'em, I can't.\"\n\n\"Well, sir,\" said the son, who dropped the \"sir\" into his speech with\nhis father, now and then, in an old-fashioned way that was rather\ncharming, \"you see, I have an indulgent parent.\"\n\n\"Smoke?\" suggested the father, pushing toward his son a box of\ncigarettes, from which he had taken one.\n\n\"No, thank you,\" said the son.  \"I've dropped that.\"\n\n\"Ah, is that so?\" The father began to feel about on the table for\nmatches, in the purblind fashion of elderly men.  His son rose, lighted\none, and handed it to him.  \"Well,--oh, thank you, Tom!--I believe some\nstatisticians prove that if you will give up smoking you can dress very\nwell on the money your tobacco costs, even if you haven't got an\nindulgent parent.  But I'm too old to try.  Though, I confess, I should\nrather like the clothes.  Whom did you find at the club?\"\n\n\"There were a lot of fellows there,\" said young Corey, watching the\naccomplished fumigation of his father in an absent way.\n\n\"It's astonishing what a hardy breed the young club-men are,\" observed\nhis father.  \"All summer through, in weather that sends the sturdiest\nfemale flying to the sea-shore, you find the clubs filled with young\nmen, who don't seem to mind the heat in the least.\"\n\n\"Boston isn't a bad place, at the worst, in summer,\" said the son,\ndeclining to take up the matter in its ironical shape.\n\n\"I dare say it isn't, compared with Texas,\" returned the father,\nsmoking tranquilly on.  \"But I don't suppose you find many of your\nfriends in town outside of the club.\"\n\n\"No; you're requested to ring at the rear door, all the way down Beacon\nStreet and up Commonwealth Avenue.  It's rather a blank reception for\nthe returning prodigal.\"\n\n\"Ah, the prodigal must take his chance if he comes back out of season.\nBut I'm glad to have you back, Tom, even as it is, and I hope you're\nnot going to hurry away.  You must give your energies a rest.\"\n\n\"I'm sure you never had to reproach me with abnormal activity,\"\nsuggested the son, taking his father's jokes in good part.\n\n\"No, I don't know that I have,\" admitted the elder.  \"You've always\nshown a fair degree of moderation, after all.  What do you think of\ntaking up next? I mean after you have embraced your mother and sisters\nat Mount Desert.  Real estate? It seems to me that it is about time for\nyou to open out as a real-estate broker.  Or did you ever think of\nmatrimony?\"\n\n\"Well, not just in that way, sir,\" said the young man.  \"I shouldn't\nquite like to regard it as a career, you know.\"\n\n\"No, no.  I understand that.  And I quite agree with you.  But you know\nI've always contended that the affections could be made to combine\npleasure and profit.  I wouldn't have a man marry for money,--that\nwould be rather bad,--but I don't see why, when it comes to falling in\nlove, a man shouldn't fall in love with a rich girl as easily as a poor\none.  Some of the rich girls are very nice, and I should say that the\nchances of a quiet life with them were rather greater.  They've always\nhad everything, and they wouldn't be so ambitious and uneasy.  Don't\nyou think so?\"\n\n\"It would depend,\" said the son, \"upon whether a girl's people had been\nrich long enough to have given her position before she married.  If\nthey hadn't, I don't see how she would be any better than a poor girl\nin that respect.\"\n\n\"Yes, there's sense in that.  But the suddenly rich are on a level with\nany of us nowadays.  Money buys position at once.  I don't say that it\nisn't all right.  The world generally knows what it's about, and knows\nhow to drive a bargain.  I dare say it makes the new rich pay too much.\nBut there's no doubt but money is to the fore now.  It is the romance,\nthe poetry of our age.  It's the thing that chiefly strikes the\nimagination.  The Englishmen who come here are more curious about the\ngreat new millionaires than about any one else, and they respect them\nmore.  It's all very well.  I don't complain of it.\"\n\n\"And you would like a rich daughter-in-law, quite regardless, then?\"\n\n\"Oh, not quite so bad as that, Tom,\" said his father.  \"A little youth,\na little beauty, a little good sense and pretty behaviour--one mustn't\nobject to those things; and they go just as often with money as without\nit.  And I suppose I should like her people to be rather grammatical.\"\n\n\"It seems to me that you're exacting, sir,\" said the son.  \"How can you\nexpect people who have been strictly devoted to business to be\ngrammatical? Isn't that rather too much?\"\n\n\"Perhaps it is.  Perhaps you're right.  But I understood your mother to\nsay that those benefactors of hers, whom you met last summer, were very\npassably grammatical.\"\n\n\"The father isn't.\"\n\nThe elder, who had been smoking with his profile toward his son, now\nturned his face full upon him.  \"I didn't know you had seen him?\"\n\n\"I hadn't until to-day,\" said young Corey, with a little heightening of\nhis colour.  \"But I was walking down street this afternoon, and\nhappened to look round at a new house some one was putting up, and I\nsaw the whole family in the window.  It appears that Mr. Lapham is\nbuilding the house.\"\n\nThe elder Corey knocked the ash of his cigarette into the holder at his\nelbow.  \"I am more and more convinced, the longer I know you, Tom, that\nwe are descended from Giles Corey.  The gift of holding one's tongue\nseems to have skipped me, but you have it in full force.  I can't say\njust how you would behave under peine forte et dure, but under ordinary\npressure you are certainly able to keep your own counsel.  Why didn't\nyou mention this encounter at dinner? You weren't asked to plead to an\naccusation of witchcraft.\"\n\n\"No, not exactly,\" said the young man.  \"But I didn't quite see my way\nto speaking of it.  We had a good many other things before us.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's true.  I suppose you wouldn't have mentioned it now if I\nhadn't led up to it, would you?\"\n\n\"I don't know, sir.  It was rather on my mind to do so.  Perhaps it was\nI who led up to it.\"\n\nHis father laughed.  \"Perhaps you did, Tom; perhaps you did.  Your\nmother would have known you were leading up to something, but I'll\nconfess that I didn't. What is it?\"\n\n\"Nothing very definite.  But do you know that in spite of his syntax I\nrather liked him?\"\n\nThe father looked keenly at the son; but unless the boy's full\nconfidence was offered, Corey was not the man to ask it.  \"Well?\" was\nall that he said.\n\n\"I suppose that in a new country one gets to looking at people a little\nout of our tradition; and I dare say that if I hadn't passed a winter\nin Texas I might have found Colonel Lapham rather too much.\"\n\n\"You mean that there are worse things in Texas?\"\n\n\"Not that exactly.  I mean that I saw it wouldn't be quite fair to test\nhim by our standards.\"\n\n\"This comes of the error which I have often deprecated,\" said the elder\nCorey.  \"In fact I am always saying that the Bostonian ought never to\nleave Boston.  Then he knows--and then only--that there can BE no\nstandard but ours.  But we are constantly going away, and coming back\nwith our convictions shaken to their foundations.  One man goes to\nEngland, and returns with the conception of a grander social life;\nanother comes home from Germany with the notion of a more searching\nintellectual activity; a fellow just back from Paris has the absurdest\nideas of art and literature; and you revert to us from the cowboys of\nTexas, and tell us to our faces that we ought to try Papa Lapham by a\njury of his peers.  It ought to be stopped--it ought, really.  The\nBostonian who leaves Boston ought to be condemned to perpetual exile.\"\n\nThe son suffered the father to reach his climax with smiling patience.\nWhen he asked finally, \"What are the characteristics of Papa Lapham\nthat place him beyond our jurisdiction?\" the younger Corey crossed his\nlong legs, and leaned forward to take one of his knees between his\nhands.\n\n\"Well, sir, he bragged, rather.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know that bragging should exempt him from the ordinary\nprocesses.  I've heard other people brag in Boston.\"\n\n\"Ah, not just in that personal way--not about money.\"\n\n\"No, that was certainly different.\"\n\n\"I don't mean,\" said the young fellow, with the scrupulosity which\npeople could not help observing and liking in him, \"that it was more\nthan an indirect expression of satisfaction in the ability to spend.\"\n\n\"No. I should be glad to express something of the kind myself, if the\nfacts would justify me.\"\n\nThe son smiled tolerantly again.  \"But if he was enjoying his money in\nthat way, I didn't see why he shouldn't show his pleasure in it.  It\nmight have been vulgar, but it wasn't sordid.  And I don't know that it\nwas vulgar.  Perhaps his successful strokes of business were the\nromance of his life----\"\n\nThe father interrupted with a laugh.  \"The girl must be uncommonly\npretty.  What did she seem to think of her father's brag?\"\n\n\"There were two of them,\" answered the son evasively.\n\n\"Oh, two! And is the sister pretty too?\"\n\n\"Not pretty, but rather interesting.  She is like her mother.\"\n\n\"Then the pretty one isn't the father's pet?\"\n\n\"I can't say, sir.  I don't believe,\" added the young fellow, \"that I\ncan make you see Colonel Lapham just as I did.  He struck me as very\nsimple-hearted and rather wholesome.  Of course he could be tiresome;\nwe all can; and I suppose his range of ideas is limited.  But he is a\nforce, and not a bad one.  If he hasn't got over being surprised at the\neffect of rubbing his lamp.\"\n\n\"Oh, one could make out a case.  I suppose you know what you are about,\nTom.  But remember that we are Essex County people, and that in savour\nwe are just a little beyond the salt of the earth.  I will tell you\nplainly that I don't like the notion of a man who has rivalled the hues\nof nature in her wildest haunts with the tints of his mineral paint;\nbut I don't say there are not worse men.  He isn't to my taste, though\nhe might be ever so much to my conscience.\"\n\n\"I suppose,\" said the son, \"that there is nothing really to be ashamed\nof in mineral paint.  People go into all sorts of things.\"\n\nHis father took his cigarette from his mouth and once more looked his\nson full in the face.  \"Oh, is THAT it?\"\n\n\"It has crossed my mind,\" admitted the son.  \"I must do something.\nI've wasted time and money enough.  I've seen much younger men all\nthrough the West and South-west taking care of themselves.  I don't\nthink I was particularly fit for anything out there, but I am ashamed\nto come back and live upon you, sir.\"\n\nHis father shook his head with an ironical sigh.  \"Ah, we shall never\nhave a real aristocracy while this plebeian reluctance to live upon a\nparent or a wife continues the animating spirit of our youth.  It\nstrikes at the root of the whole feudal system.  I really think you owe\nme an apology, Tom.  I supposed you wished to marry the girl's money,\nand here you are, basely seeking to go into business with her father.\"\n\nYoung Corey laughed again like a son who perceives that his father is a\nlittle antiquated, but keeps a filial faith in his wit.  \"I don't know\nthat it's quite so bad as that; but the thing had certainly crossed my\nmind.  I don't know how it's to be approached, and I don't know that\nit's at all possible.  But I confess that I 'took to' Colonel Lapham\nfrom the moment I saw him.  He looked as if he 'meant business,' and I\nmean business too.\"\n\nThe father smoked thoughtfully.  \"Of course people do go into all sorts\nof things, as you say, and I don't know that one thing is more ignoble\nthan another, if it's decent and large enough.  In my time you would\nhave gone into the China trade or the India trade--though I didn't; and\na little later cotton would have been your manifest destiny--though it\nwasn't mine; but now a man may do almost anything.  The real-estate\nbusiness is pretty full.  Yes, if you have a deep inward vocation for\nit, I don't see why mineral paint shouldn't do.  I fancy it's easy\nenough approaching the matter.  We will invite Papa Lapham to dinner,\nand talk it over with him.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't think that would be exactly the way, sir,\" said the son,\nsmiling at his father's patrician unworldliness.\n\n\"No? Why not?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid it would be a bad start.  I don't think it would strike him\nas business-like.\"\n\n\"I don't see why he should be punctilious, if we're not.\"\n\n\"Ah, we might say that if he were making the advances.\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps you are right, Tom.  What is your idea?\"\n\n\"I haven't a very clear one.  It seems to me I ought to get some\nbusiness friend of ours, whose judgment he would respect, to speak a\ngood word for me.\"\n\n\"Give you a character?\"\n\n\"Yes. And of course I must go to Colonel Lapham.  My notion would be to\ninquire pretty thoroughly about him, and then, if I liked the look of\nthings, to go right down to Republic Street and let him see what he\ncould do with me, if anything.\"\n\n\"That sounds tremendously practical to me, Tom, though it may be just\nthe wrong way.  When are you going down to Mount Desert?\"\n\n\"To-morrow, I think, sir,\" said the young man.  \"I shall turn it over\nin my mind while I'm off.\"\n\nThe father rose, showing something more than his son's height, with a\nvery slight stoop, which the son's figure had not.  \"Well,\" he said,\nwhimsically, \"I admire your spirit, and I don't deny that it is\njustified by necessity.  It's a consolation to think that while I've\nbeen spending and enjoying, I have been preparing the noblest future\nfor you--a future of industry and self-reliance. You never could draw,\nbut this scheme of going into the mineral-paint business shows that you\nhave inherited something of my feeling for colour.\"\n\nThe son laughed once more, and waiting till his father was well on his\nway upstairs, turned out the gas and then hurried after him and\npreceded him into his chamber.  He glanced over it to see that\neverything was there, to his father's hand.  Then he said, \"Good night,\nsir,\" and the elder responded, \"Good night, my son,\" and the son went\nto his own room.\n\nOver the mantel in the elder Corey's room hung a portrait which he had\npainted of his own father, and now he stood a moment and looked at this\nas if struck by something novel in it.  The resemblance between his son\nand the old India merchant, who had followed the trade from Salem to\nBoston when the larger city drew it away from the smaller, must have\nbeen what struck him.  Grandfather and grandson had both the Roman nose\nwhich appears to have flourished chiefly at the formative period of the\nrepublic, and which occurs more rarely in the descendants of the\nconscript fathers, though it still characterises the profiles of a good\nmany Boston ladies.  Bromfield Corey had not inherited it, and he had\nmade his straight nose his defence when the old merchant accused him of\na want of energy.  He said, \"What could a man do whose unnatural father\nhad left his own nose away from him?\" This amused but did not satisfy\nthe merchant.  \"You must do something,\" he said; \"and it's for you to\nchoose.  If you don't like the India trade, go into something else.\nOr, take up law or medicine.  No Corey yet ever proposed to do\nnothing.\" \"Ah, then, it's quite time one of us made a beginning,\" urged\nthe man who was then young, and who was now old, looking into the\nsomewhat fierce eyes of his father's portrait.  He had inherited as\nlittle of the fierceness as of the nose, and there was nothing\npredatory in his son either, though the aquiline beak had come down to\nhim in such force.  Bromfield Corey liked his son Tom for the\ngentleness which tempered his energy.\n\n\"Well let us compromise,\" he seemed to be saying to his father's\nportrait.  \"I will travel.\" \"Travel? How long?\" the keen eyes demanded.\n\"Oh, indefinitely.  I won't be hard with you, father.\" He could see the\neyes soften, and the smile of yielding come over his father's face; the\nmerchant could not resist a son who was so much like his dead mother.\nThere was some vague understanding between them that Bromfield Corey\nwas to come back and go into business after a time, but he never did\nso.  He travelled about over Europe, and travelled handsomely,\nfrequenting good society everywhere, and getting himself presented at\nseveral courts, at a period when it was a distinction to do so.  He had\nalways sketched, and with his father's leave he fixed himself at Rome,\nwhere he remained studying art and rounding the being inherited from\nhis Yankee progenitors, till there was very little left of the\nancestral angularities.  After ten years he came home and painted that\nportrait of his father.  It was very good, if a little amateurish, and\nhe might have made himself a name as a painter of portraits if he had\nnot had so much money.  But he had plenty of money, though by this time\nhe was married and beginning to have a family.  It was absurd for him\nto paint portraits for pay, and ridiculous to paint them for nothing;\nso he did not paint them at all.  He continued a dilettante, never\nquite abandoning his art, but working at it fitfully, and talking more\nabout it than working at it.  He had his theory of Titian's method; and\nnow and then a Bostonian insisted upon buying a picture of him.  After\na while he hung it more and more inconspicuously, and said\napologetically, \"Oh yes! that's one of Bromfield Corey's things.  It\nhas nice qualities, but it's amateurish.\"\n\nIn process of time the money seemed less abundant.  There were\nshrinkages of one kind and another, and living had grown much more\nexpensive and luxurious.  For many years he talked about going back to\nRome, but he never went, and his children grew up in the usual way.\nBefore he knew it his son had him out to his class-day spread at\nHarvard, and then he had his son on his hands.  The son made various\nunsuccessful provisions for himself, and still continued upon his\nfather's hands, to their common dissatisfaction, though it was chiefly\nthe younger who repined.  He had the Roman nose and the energy without\nthe opportunity, and at one of the reversions his father said to him,\n\"You ought not to have that nose, Tom; then you would do very well.\nYou would go and travel, as I did.\"\n\n\nLAPHAM and his wife continued talking after he had quelled the\ndisturbance in his daughters' room overhead; and their talk was not\naltogether of the new house.\n\n\"I tell you,\" he said, \"if I had that fellow in the business with me I\nwould make a man of him.\"\n\n\"Well, Silas Lapham,\" returned his wife, \"I do believe you've got\nmineral paint on the brain.  Do you suppose a fellow like young Corey,\nbrought up the way he's been, would touch mineral paint with a ten-foot\npole?\"\n\n\"Why not?\" haughtily asked the Colonel.\n\n\"Well, if you don't know already, there's no use trying to tell you.\"\n\n\n\nVI.\n\n\nTHE Coreys had always had a house at Nahant, but after letting it for a\nseason or two they found they could get on without it, and sold it at\nthe son's instance, who foresaw that if things went on as they were\ngoing, the family would be straitened to the point of changing their\nmode of life altogether.  They began to be of the people of whom it was\nsaid that they stayed in town very late; and when the ladies did go\naway, it was for a brief summering in this place and that.  The father\nremained at home altogether; and the son joined them in the intervals\nof his enterprises, which occurred only too often.\n\nAt Bar Harbour, where he now went to find them, after his winter in\nTexas, he confessed to his mother that there seemed no very good\nopening there for him.  He might do as well as Loring Stanton, but he\ndoubted if Stanton was doing very well.  Then he mentioned the new\nproject which he had been thinking over.  She did not deny that there\nwas something in it, but she could not think of any young man who had\ngone into such a business as that, and it appeared to her that he might\nas well go into a patent medicine or a stove-polish.\n\n\"There was one of his hideous advertisements,\" she said, \"painted on a\nreef that we saw as we came down.\"\n\nCorey smiled.  \"Well, I suppose, if it was in a good state of\npreservation, that is proof positive of the efficacy of the paint on\nthe hulls of vessels.\"\n\n\"It's very distasteful to me, Tom,\" said his mother; and if there was\nsomething else in her mind, she did not speak more plainly of it than\nto add: \"It's not only the kind of business, but the kind of people you\nwould be mixed up with.\"\n\n\"I thought you didn't find them so very bad,\" suggested Corey.\n\n\"I hadn't seen them in Nankeen Square then.\"\n\n\"You can see them on the water side of Beacon Street when you go back.\"\n\nThen he told of his encounter with the Lapham family in their new\nhouse.  At the end his mother merely said, \"It is getting very common\ndown there,\" and she did not try to oppose anything further to his\nscheme.\n\nThe young man went to see Colonel Lapham shortly after his return to\nBoston.  He paid his visit at Lapham's office, and if he had studied\nsimplicity in his summer dress he could not have presented himself in a\nfigure more to the mind of a practical man.  His hands and neck still\nkept the brown of the Texan suns and winds, and he looked as\nbusiness-like as Lapham himself.\n\nHe spoke up promptly and briskly in the outer office, and caused the\npretty girl to look away from her copying at him.  \"Is Mr. Lapham in?\"\nhe asked; and after that moment for reflection which an array of\nbook-keepers so addressed likes to give the inquirer, a head was lifted\nfrom a ledger and nodded toward the inner office.\n\nLapham had recognised the voice, and he was standing, in considerable\nperplexity, to receive Corey, when the young man opened his painted\nglass door.  It was a hot afternoon, and Lapham was in his shirt\nsleeves.  Scarcely a trace of the boastful hospitality with which he\nhad welcomed Corey to his house a few days before lingered in his\npresent address.  He looked at the young man's face, as if he expected\nhim to despatch whatever unimaginable affair he had come upon.\n\n\"Won't you sit down? How are you? You'll excuse me,\" he added, in brief\nallusion to the shirt-sleeves. \"I'm about roasted.\"\n\nCorey laughed.  \"I wish you'd let me take off MY coat.\"\n\n\"Why, TAKE it off!\" cried the Colonel, with instant pleasure.  There is\nsomething in human nature which causes the man in his shirt-sleeves to\nwish all other men to appear in the same deshabille.\n\n\"I will, if you ask me after I've talked with you two minutes,\" said\nthe young fellow, companionably pulling up the chair offered him toward\nthe desk where Lapham had again seated himself.  \"But perhaps you\nhaven't got two minutes to give me?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I have,\" said the Colonel.  \"I was just going to knock off.  I\ncan give you twenty, and then I shall have fifteen minutes to catch the\nboat.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Corey.  \"I want you to take me into the mineral paint\nbusiness.\"\n\nThe Colonel sat dumb.  He twisted his thick neck, and looked round at\nthe door to see if it was shut.  He would not have liked to have any of\nthose fellows outside hear him, but there is no saying what sum of\nmoney he would not have given if his wife had been there to hear what\nCorey had just said.\n\n\"I suppose,\" continued the young man, \"I could have got several people\nwhose names you know to back my industry and sobriety, and say a word\nfor my business capacity.  But I thought I wouldn't trouble anybody for\ncertificates till I found whether there was a chance, or the ghost of\none, of your wanting me.  So I came straight to you.\"\n\nLapham gathered himself together as well as he could.  He had not yet\nforgiven Corey for Mrs. Lapham's insinuation that he would feel himself\ntoo good for the mineral paint business; and though he was dispersed by\nthat astounding shot at first, he was not going to let any one even\nhypothetically despise his paint with impunity.  \"How do you think I am\ngoing to take you on?\" They took on hands at the works; and Lapham put\nit as if Corey were a hand coming to him for employment.  Whether he\nsatisfied himself by this or not, he reddened a little after he had\nsaid it.\n\nCorey answered, ignorant of the offence: \"I haven't a very clear idea,\nI'm afraid; but I've been looking a little into the matter from the\noutside.\"\n\n\"I hope you hain't been paying any attention to that fellow's stuff in\nthe Events?\" Lapham interrupted.  Since Bartley's interview had\nappeared, Lapham had regarded it with very mixed feelings.  At first it\ngave him a glow of secret pleasure, blended with doubt as to how his\nwife would like the use Bartley had made of her in it.  But she had not\nseemed to notice it much, and Lapham had experienced the gratitude of\nthe man who escapes.  Then his girls had begun to make fun of it; and\nthough he did not mind Penelope's jokes much, he did not like to see\nthat Irene's gentility was wounded.  Business friends met him with the\nkind of knowing smile about it that implied their sense of the\nfraudulent character of its praise--the smile of men who had been there\nand who knew how it was themselves.  Lapham had his misgivings as to\nhow his clerks and underlings looked at it; he treated them with\nstately severity for a while after it came out, and he ended by feeling\nrather sore about it.  He took it for granted that everybody had read\nit.\n\n\"I don't know what you mean,\" replied Corey, \"I don't see the Events\nregularly.\"\n\n\"Oh, it was nothing.  They sent a fellow down here to interview me, and\nhe got everything about as twisted as he could.\"\n\n\"I believe they always do,\" said Corey.  \"I hadn't seen it.  Perhaps it\ncame out before I got home.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it did.\"\n\n\"My notion of making myself useful to you was based on a hint I got\nfrom one of your own circulars.\"\n\nLapham was proud of those circulars; he thought they read very well.\n\"What was that?\"\n\n\"I could put a little capital into the business,\" said Corey, with the\ntentative accent of a man who chances a thing.  \"I've got a little\nmoney, but I didn't imagine you cared for anything of that kind.\"\n\n\"No, sir, I don't,\" returned the Colonel bluntly.  \"I've had one\npartner, and one's enough.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" assented the young man, who doubtless had his own ideas as to\neventualities--or perhaps rather had the vague hopes of youth.  \"I\ndidn't come to propose a partnership.  But I see that you are\nintroducing your paint into the foreign markets, and there I really\nthought I might be of use to you, and to myself too.\"\n\n\"How?\" asked the Colonel scantly.\n\n\"Well, I know two or three languages pretty well.  I know French, and I\nknow German, and I've got a pretty fair sprinkling of Spanish.\"\n\n\"You mean that you can talk them?\" asked the Colonel, with the mingled\nawe and slight that such a man feels for such accomplishments.  \"Yes;\nand I can write an intelligible letter in either of them.\"\n\nLapham rubbed his nose.  \"It's easy enough to get all the letters we\nwant translated.\"\n\n\"Well,\" pursued Corey, not showing his discouragement if he felt any,\n\"I know the countries where you want to introduce this paint of yours.\nI've been there.  I've been in Germany and France and I've been in\nSouth America and Mexico; I've been in Italy, of course.  I believe I\ncould go to any of those countries and place it to advantage.\"\n\nLapham had listened with a trace of persuasion in his face, but now he\nshook his head.\n\n\"It's placing itself as fast as there's any call for it.  It wouldn't\npay us to send anybody out to look after it.  Your salary and expenses\nwould eat up about all we should make on it.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" returned the young man intrepidly, \"if you had to pay me any\nsalary and expenses.\"\n\n\"You don't propose to work for nothing?\"\n\n\"I propose to work for a commission.\" The Colonel was beginning to\nshake his head again, but Corey hurried on.  \"I haven't come to you\nwithout making some inquiries about the paint, and I know how it stands\nwith those who know best.  I believe in it.\"\n\nLapham lifted his head and looked at the young man, deeply moved.\n\n\"It's the best paint in God's universe,\" he said with the solemnity of\nprayer.\n\n\"It's the best in the market,\" said Corey; and he repeated, \"I believe\nin it.\"\n\n\"You believe in it,\" began the Colonel, and then he stopped.  If there\nhad really been any purchasing power in money, a year's income would\nhave bought Mrs. Lapham's instant presence.  He warmed and softened to\nthe young man in every way, not only because he must do so to any one\nwho believed in his paint, but because he had done this innocent person\nthe wrong of listening to a defamation of his instinct and good sense,\nand had been willing to see him suffer for a purely supposititious\noffence.\n\nCorey rose.\n\n\"You mustn't let me outstay my twenty minutes,\" he said, taking out his\nwatch.  \"I don't expect you to give a decided answer on the spot.  All\nthat I ask is that you'll consider my proposition.\"\n\n\"Don't hurry,\" said Lapham.  \"Sit still! I want to tell you about this\npaint,\" he added, in a voice husky with the feeling that his hearer\ncould not divine.  \"I want to tell you ALL about it.\"\n\n\"I could walk with you to the boat,\" suggested the young man.\n\n\"Never mind the boat! I can take the next one.  Look here!\" The Colonel\npulled open a drawer, as Corey sat down again, and took out a\nphotograph of the locality of the mine.  \"Here's where we get it.  This\nphotograph don't half do the place justice,\" he said, as if the\nimperfect art had slighted the features of a beloved face.  \"It's one\nof the sightliest places in the country, and here's the very spot \"--he\ncovered it with his huge forefinger--\"where my father found that paint,\nmore than forty--years--ago. Yes, sir!\"\n\nHe went on, and told the story in unsparing detail, while his chance\nfor the boat passed unheeded, and the clerks in the outer office hung\nup their linen office coats and put on their seersucker or flannel\nstreet coats.  The young lady went too, and nobody was left but the\nporter, who made from time to time a noisy demonstration of fastening a\ndistant blind, or putting something in place.  At last the Colonel\nroused himself from the autobiographical delight of the history of his\npaint.  \"Well, sir, that's the story.\"\n\n\"It's an interesting story,\" said Corey, with a long breath, as they\nrose together, and Lapham put on his coat.\n\n\"That's what it is,\" said the Colonel.  \"Well!\" he added, \"I don't see\nbut what we've got to have another talk about this thing.  It's a\nsurprise to me, and I don't see exactly how you're going to make it\npay.\"\n\n\"I'm willing to take the chances,\" answered Corey.  \"As I said, I\nbelieve in it.  I should try South America first.  I should try Chili.\"\n\n\"Look here!\" said Lapham, with his watch in his hand.  \"I like to get\nthings over.  We've just got time for the six o'clock boat.  Why don't\nyou come down with me to Nantasket? I can give you a bed as well as\nnot.  And then we can finish up.\"\n\nThe impatience of youth in Corey responded to the impatience of\ntemperament in his elder.  \"Why, I don't see why I shouldn't,\" he\nallowed himself to say.  \"I confess I should like to have it finished\nup myself, if it could be finished up in the right way.\"\n\n\"Well, we'll see.  Dennis!\" Lapham called to the remote porter, and the\nman came.  \"Want to send any word home?\" he asked Corey.\n\n\"No; my father and I go and come as we like, without keeping account of\neach other.  If I don't come home, he knows that I'm not there.  That's\nall.\"\n\n\"Well, that's convenient.  You'll find you can't do that when you're\nmarried.  Never mind, Dennis,\" said the Colonel.\n\nHe had time to buy two newspapers on the wharf before he jumped on\nboard the steam-boat with Corey.  \"Just made it,\" he said; \"and that's\nwhat I like to do.  I can't stand it to be aboard much more than a\nminute before she shoves out.\" He gave one of the newspapers to Corey\nas he spoke, and set him the example of catching up a camp-stool on\ntheir way to that point on the boat which his experience had taught him\nwas the best.  He opened his paper at once and began to run over its\nnews, while the young man watched the spectacular recession of the\ncity, and was vaguely conscious of the people about him, and of the gay\nlife of the water round the boat.  The air freshened; the craft thinned\nin number; they met larger sail, lagging slowly inward in the afternoon\nlight; the islands of the bay waxed and waned as the steamer approached\nand left them behind.\n\n\"I hate to see them stirring up those Southern fellows again,\" said the\nColonel, speaking into the paper on his lap.  \"Seems to me it's time to\nlet those old issues go.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the young man.  \"What are they doing now?\"\n\n\"Oh, stirring up the Confederate brigadiers in Congress.  I don't like\nit.  Seems to me, if our party hain't got any other stock-in-trade, we\nbetter shut up shop altogether.\" Lapham went on, as he scanned his\nnewspaper, to give his ideas of public questions, in a fragmentary way,\nwhile Corey listened patiently, and waited for him to come back to\nbusiness.  He folded up his paper at last, and stuffed it into his coat\npocket.  \"There's one thing I always make it a rule to do,\" he said,\n\"and that is to give my mind a complete rest from business while I'm\ngoing down on the boat.  I like to get the fresh air all through me,\nsoul and body.  I believe a man can give his mind a rest, just the same\nas he can give his legs a rest, or his back.  All he's got to do is to\nuse his will-power. Why, I suppose, if I hadn't adopted some such rule,\nwith the strain I've had on me for the last ten years, I should 'a'\nbeen a dead man long ago.  That's the reason I like a horse.  You've\ngot to give your mind to the horse; you can't help it, unless you want\nto break your neck; but a boat's different, and there you got to use\nyour will-power.  You got to take your mind right up and put it where\nyou want it.  I make it a rule to read the paper on the boat----Hold\non!\" he interrupted himself to prevent Corey from paying his fare to\nthe man who had come round for it.  \"I've got tickets.  And when I get\nthrough the paper, I try to get somebody to talk to, or I watch the\npeople.  It's an astonishing thing to me where they all come from.\nI've been riding up and down on these boats for six or seven years, and\nI don't know but very few of the faces I see on board.  Seems to be a\nperfectly fresh lot every time.  Well, of course! Town's full of\nstrangers in the summer season, anyway, and folks keep coming down from\nthe country.  They think it's a great thing to get down to the beach,\nand they've all heard of the electric light on the water, and they want\nto see it.  But you take faces now! The astonishing thing to me is not\nwhat a face tells, but what it don't tell.  When you think of what a\nman is, or a woman is, and what most of 'em have been through before\nthey get to be thirty, it seems as if their experience would burn right\nthrough.  But it don't. I like to watch the couples, and try to make\nout which are engaged, or going to be, and which are married, or better\nbe.  But half the time I can't make any sort of guess.  Of course,\nwhere they're young and kittenish, you can tell; but where they're\nanyways on, you can't.  Heigh?\"\n\n\"Yes, I think you're right,\" said Corey, not perfectly reconciled to\nphilosophy in the place of business, but accepting it as he must.\n\n\"Well,\" said the Colonel, \"I don't suppose it was meant we should know\nwhat was in each other's minds.  It would take a man out of his own\nhands.  As long as he's in his own hands, there's some hopes of his\ndoing something with himself; but if a fellow has been found out--even\nif he hasn't been found out to be so very bad--it's pretty much all up\nwith him.  No, sir.  I don't want to know people through and through.\"\n\nThe greater part of the crowd on board--and, of course, the boat was\ncrowded--looked as if they might not only be easily but safely known.\nThere was little style and no distinction among them; they were people\nwho were going down to the beach for the fun or the relief of it, and\nwere able to afford it.  In face they were commonplace, with nothing\nbut the American poetry of vivid purpose to light them up, where they\ndid not wholly lack fire.  But they were nearly all shrewd and\nfriendly-looking, with an apparent readiness for the humorous intimacy\nnative to us all.  The women were dandified in dress, according to\ntheir means and taste, and the men differed from each other in degrees\nof indifference to it.  To a straw-hatted population, such as ours is\nin summer, no sort of personal dignity is possible.  We have not even\nthe power over observers which comes from the fantasticality of an\nEnglishman when he discards the conventional dress.  In our straw hats\nand our serge or flannel sacks we are no more imposing than a crowd of\nboys.\n\n\"Some day,\" said Lapham, rising as the boat drew near the wharf of the\nfinal landing, \"there's going to be an awful accident on these boats.\nJust look at that jam.\"\n\nHe meant the people thickly packed on the pier, and under strong\nrestraint of locks and gates, to prevent them from rushing on board the\nboat and possessing her for the return trip before she had landed her\nNantasket passengers.\n\n\"Overload 'em every time,\" he continued, with a sort of dry, impersonal\nconcern at the impending calamity, as if it could not possibly include\nhim.  \"They take about twice as many as they ought to carry, and about\nten times as many as they could save if anything happened.  Yes, sir,\nit's bound to come.  Hello! There's my girl!\" He took out his folded\nnewspaper and waved it toward a group of phaetons and barouches drawn\nup on the pier a little apart from the pack of people, and a lady in\none of them answered with a flourish of her parasol.\n\nWhen he had made his way with his guest through the crowd, she began to\nspeak to her father before she noticed Corey.  \"Well, Colonel, you've\nimproved your last chance.  We've been coming to every boat since four\no'clock,--or Jerry has,--and I told mother that I would come myself\nonce, and see if I couldn't fetch you; and if I failed, you could walk\nnext time.  You're getting perfectly spoiled.\"\n\nThe Colonel enjoyed letting her scold him to the end before he said,\nwith a twinkle of pride in his guest and satisfaction in her probably\nbeing able to hold her own against any discomfiture, \"I've brought Mr.\nCorey down for the night with me, and I was showing him things all the\nway, and it took time.\"\n\nThe young fellow was at the side of the open beach-wagon, making a\nquick bow, and Penelope Lapham was cozily drawling, \"Oh, how do you do,\nMr. Corey?\" before the Colonel had finished his explanation.\n\n\"Get right in there, alongside of Miss Lapham, Mr. Corey,\" he said,\npulling himself up into the place beside the driver.  \"No, no,\" he had\nadded quickly, at some signs of polite protest in the young man, \"I\ndon't give up the best place to anybody.  Jerry, suppose you let me\nhave hold of the leathers a minute.\"\n\nThis was his way of taking the reins from the driver; and in half the\ntime he specified, he had skilfully turned the vehicle on the pier,\namong the crooked lines and groups of foot-passengers, and was spinning\nup the road toward the stretch of verandaed hotels and restaurants in\nthe sand along the shore.  \"Pretty gay down here,\" he said, indicating\nall this with a turn of his whip, as he left it behind him.  \"But I've\ngot about sick of hotels; and this summer I made up my mind that I'd\ntake a cottage.  Well, Pen, how are the folks?\" He looked half-way\nround for her answer, and with the eye thus brought to bear upon her he\nwas able to give her a wink of supreme content.  The Colonel, with no\nsort of ulterior design, and nothing but his triumph over Mrs. Lapham\ndefinitely in his mind, was feeling, as he would have said, about right.\n\n\nThe girl smiled a daughter's amusement at her father's boyishness.  \"I\ndon't think there's much change since morning.  Did Irene have a\nheadache when you left?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the Colonel.\n\n\"Well, then, there's that to report.\"\n\n\"Pshaw!\" said the Colonel with vexation in his tone.\n\n\"I'm sorry Miss Irene isn't well,\" said Corey politely.\n\n\"I think she must have got it from walking too long on the beach.  The\nair is so cool here that you forget how hot the sun is.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's true,\" assented Corey.\n\n\"A good night's rest will make it all right,\" suggested the Colonel,\nwithout looking round.  \"But you girls have got to look out.\"\n\n\"If you're fond of walking,\" said Corey, \"I suppose you find the beach\na temptation.\"\n\n\"Oh, it isn't so much that,\" returned the girl.  \"You keep walking on\nand on because it's so smooth and straight before you.  We've been here\nso often that we know it all by heart--just how it looks at high tide,\nand how it looks at low tide, and how it looks after a storm.  We're as\nwell acquainted with the crabs and stranded jelly-fish as we are with\nthe children digging in the sand and the people sitting under\numbrellas.  I think they're always the same, all of them.\"\n\nThe Colonel left the talk to the young people.  When he spoke next it\nwas to say, \"Well, here we are!\" and he turned from the highway and\ndrove up in front of a brown cottage with a vermilion roof, and a group\nof geraniums clutching the rock that cropped up in the loop formed by\nthe road.  It was treeless and bare all round, and the ocean,\nunnecessarily vast, weltered away a little more than a stone's-cast\nfrom the cottage.  A hospitable smell of supper filled the air, and\nMrs. Lapham was on the veranda, with that demand in her eyes for her\nbelated husband's excuses, which she was obliged to check on her tongue\nat sight of Corey.\n\n\n\nVII.\n\n\nTHE exultant Colonel swung himself lightly down from his seat.  \"I've\nbrought Mr. Corey with me,\" he nonchalantly explained.\n\nMrs. Lapham made their guest welcome, and the Colonel showed him to his\nroom, briefly assuring himself that there was nothing wanting there.\nThen he went to wash his own hands, carelessly ignoring the eagerness\nwith which his wife pursued him to their chamber.\n\n\"What gave Irene a headache?\" he asked, making himself a fine lather\nfor his hairy paws.\n\n\"Never you mind Irene,\" promptly retorted his wife.  \"How came he to\ncome? Did you press him? If you DID, I'll never forgive you, Silas!\"\n\nThe Colonel laughed, and his wife shook him by the shoulder to make him\nlaugh lower.  \"'Sh!\" she whispered.  \"Do you want him to hear EVERY\nthing? DID you urge him?\"\n\nThe Colonel laughed the more.  He was going to get all the good out of\nthis.  \"No, I didn't urge him.  Seemed to want to come.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it.  Where did you meet him?\"\n\n\"At the office.\"\n\n\"What office?\"\n\n\"Mine.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! What was he doing there?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing much.\"\n\n\"What did he come for?\" \"Come for? Oh! he SAID he wanted to go into the\nmineral paint business.\"\n\nMrs. Lapham dropped into a chair, and watched his bulk shaken with\nsmothered laughter.  \"Silas Lapham,\" she gasped, \"if you try to get off\nany more of those things on me----\"\n\nThe Colonel applied himself to the towel.  \"Had a notion he could work\nit in South America.  I don't know what he's up to.\"\n\n\"Never mind!\" cried his wife.  \"I'll get even with you YET.\"\n\n\"So I told him he had better come down and talk it over,\" continued the\nColonel, in well-affected simplicity.  \"I knew he wouldn't touch it\nwith a ten-foot pole.\"\n\n\"Go on!\" threatened Mrs. Lapham.\n\n\"Right thing to do, wa'n't it?\"\n\nA tap was heard at the door, and Mrs. Lapham answered it.  A maid\nannounced supper.  \"Very well,\" she said, \"come to tea now.  But I'll\nmake you pay for this, Silas.\"\n\nPenelope had gone to her sister's room as soon as she entered the house.\n\n\"Is your head any better, 'Rene?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes, a little,\" came a voice from the pillows.  \"But I shall not come\nto tea.  I don't want anything.  If I keep still, I shall be all right\nby morning.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm sorry,\" said the elder sister.  \"He's come down with father.\"\n\n\"He hasn't! Who?\" cried Irene, starting up in simultaneous denial and\ndemand.\n\n\"Oh, well, if you say he hasn't, what's the use of my telling you who?\"\n\n\"Oh, how can you treat me so!\" moaned the sufferer.  \"What do you mean,\nPen?\"\n\n\"I guess I'd better not tell you,\" said Penelope, watching her like a\ncat playing with a mouse.  \"If you're not coming to tea, it would just\nexcite you for nothing.\"\n\nThe mouse moaned and writhed upon the bed.\n\n\"Oh, I wouldn't treat YOU so!\"\n\nThe cat seated herself across the room, and asked quietly--\n\n\n\"Well, what could you do if it WAS Mr. Corey? You couldn't come to tea,\nyou say.  But HE'LL excuse you.  I've told him you had a headache.\nWhy, of course you can't come! It would be too barefaced. But you\nneedn't be troubled, Irene; I'll do my best to make the time pass\npleasantly for him.\" Here the cat gave a low titter, and the mouse\ngirded itself up with a momentary courage and self-respect.\n\n\"I should think you would be ashamed to come here and tease me so.\"\n\n\"I don't see why you shouldn't believe me,\" argued Penelope.  \"Why\nshouldn't he come down with father, if father asked him? and he'd be\nsure to if he thought of it.  I don't see any p'ints about that frog\nthat's any better than any other frog.\"\n\nThe sense of her sister's helplessness was too much for the tease; she\nbroke down in a fit of smothered laughter, which convinced her victim\nthat it was nothing but an ill-timed joke.\n\n\"Well, Pen, I wouldn't use you so,\" she whimpered.\n\nPenelope threw herself on the bed beside her.\n\n\"Oh, poor Irene! He IS here.  It's a solemn fact.\" And she caressed and\nsoothed her sister, while she choked with laughter.  \"You must get up\nand come out.  I don't know what brought him here, but here he is.\"\n\n\"It's too late now,\" said Irene desolately.  Then she added, with a\nwilder despair: \"What a fool I was to take that walk!\"\n\n\"Well,\" coaxed her sister, \"come out and get some tea.  The tea will do\nyou good.\"\n\n\"No, no; I can't come.  But send me a cup here.\"\n\n\"Yes, and then perhaps you can see him later in the evening.\"\n\n\"I shall not see him at all.\"\n\nAn hour after Penelope came back to her sister's room and found her\nbefore her glass.  \"You might as well have kept still, and been well by\nmorning, 'Rene,\" she said.  \"As soon as we were done father said,\n'Well, Mr. Corey and I have got to talk over a little matter of\nbusiness, and we'll excuse you, ladies.' He looked at mother in a way\nthat I guess was pretty hard to bear.  'Rene, you ought to have heard\nthe Colonel swelling at supper.  It would have made you feel that all\nhe said the other day was nothing.\"\n\nMrs. Lapham suddenly opened the door.\n\n\"Now, see here, Pen,\" she said, as she closed it behind her, \"I've had\njust as much as I can stand from your father, and if you don't tell me\nthis instant what it all means----\"\n\nShe left the consequences to imagination, and Penelope replied with her\nmock soberness--\n\n\"Well, the Colonel does seem to be on his high horse, ma'am. But you\nmustn't ask me what his business with Mr. Corey is, for I don't know.\nAll that I know is that I met them at the landing, and that they\nconversed all the way down--on literary topics.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! What do you think it is?\"\n\n\"Well, if you want my candid opinion, I think this talk about business\nis nothing but a blind.  It seems a pity Irene shouldn't have been up\nto receive him,\" she added.\n\nIrene cast a mute look of imploring at her mother, who was too much\npreoccupied to afford her the protection it asked.\n\n\"Your father said he wanted to go into the business with him.\"\n\nIrene's look changed to a stare of astonishment and mystification, but\nPenelope preserved her imperturbability.\n\n\"Well, it's a lucrative business, I believe.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't believe a word of it!\" cried Mrs. Lapham.  \"And so I\ntold your father.\"\n\n\"Did it seem to convince him?\" inquired Penelope.\n\nHer mother did not reply.  \"I know one thing,\" she said.  \"He's got to\ntell me every word, or there'll be no sleep for him THIS night.\"\n\n\"Well, ma'am,\" said Penelope, breaking down in one of her queer laughs,\n\"I shouldn't be a bit surprised if you were right.\"\n\n\"Go on and dress, Irene,\" ordered her mother, \"and then you and Pen\ncome out into the parlour.  They can have just two hours for business,\nand then we must all be there to receive him.  You haven't got headache\nenough to hurt you.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's all gone now,\" said the girl.\n\nAt the end of the limit she had given the Colonel, Mrs. Lapham looked\ninto the dining-room, which she found blue with his smoke.\n\n\"I think you gentlemen will find the parlour pleasanter now, and we can\ngive it up to you.\"\n\n\"Oh no, you needn't,\" said her husband.  \"We've got about through.\"\nCorey was already standing, and Lapham rose too.  \"I guess we can join\nthe ladies now.  We can leave that little point till to-morrow.\"\n\nBoth of the young ladies were in the parlour when Corey entered with\ntheir father, and both were frankly indifferent to the few books and\nthe many newspapers scattered about on the table where the large lamp\nwas placed.  But after Corey had greeted Irene he glanced at the novel\nunder his eye, and said, in the dearth that sometimes befalls people at\nsuch times: \"I see you're reading Middlemarch.  Do you like George\nEliot?\"\n\n\"Who?\" asked the girl.\n\nPenelope interposed.  \"I don't believe Irene's read it yet.  I've just\ngot it out of the library; I heard so much talk about it.  I wish she\nwould let you find out a little about the people for yourself,\" she\nadded.  But here her father struck in--\n\n\"I can't get the time for books.  It's as much as I can do to keep up\nwith the newspapers; and when night comes, I'm tired, and I'd rather go\nout to the theatre, or a lecture, if they've got a good stereopticon to\ngive you views of the places.  But I guess we all like a play better\nthan 'most anything else.  I want something that'll make me laugh.  I\ndon't believe in tragedy.  I think there's enough of that in real life\nwithout putting it on the stage.  Seen 'Joshua Whitcomb'?\"\n\nThe whole family joined in the discussion, and it appeared that they\nall had their opinions of the plays and actors.  Mrs. Lapham brought\nthe talk back to literature.  \"I guess Penelope does most of our\nreading.\"\n\n\"Now, mother, you're not going to put it all on me!\" said the girl, in\ncomic protest.\n\nHer mother laughed, and then added, with a sigh: \"I used to like to get\nhold of a good book when I was a girl; but we weren't allowed to read\nmany novels in those days.  My mother called them all LIES.  And I\nguess she wasn't so very far wrong about some of them.\"\n\n\"They're certainly fictions,\" said Corey, smiling.\n\n\"Well, we do buy a good many books, first and last,\" said the Colonel,\nwho probably had in mind the costly volumes which they presented to one\nanother on birthdays and holidays.  \"But I get about all the reading I\nwant in the newspapers.  And when the girls want a novel, I tell 'em to\nget it out of the library.  That's what the library's for.  Phew!\" he\npanted, blowing away the whole unprofitable subject.  \"How close you\nwomen-folks like to keep a room! You go down to the sea-side or up to\nthe mountains for a change of air, and then you cork yourselves into a\nroom so tight you don't have any air at all.  Here! You girls get on\nyour bonnets, and go and show Mr. Corey the view of the hotels from the\nrocks.\"\n\nCorey said that he should be delighted.  The girls exchanged looks with\neach other, and then with their mother.  Irene curved her pretty chin\nin comment upon her father's incorrigibility, and Penelope made a droll\nmouth, but the Colonel remained serenely content with his finesse.  \"I\ngot 'em out of the way,\" he said, as soon as they were gone, and before\nhis wife had time to fall upon him, \"because I've got through my talk\nwith him, and now I want to talk with YOU.  It's just as I said,\nPersis; he wants to go into the business with me.\"\n\n\"It's lucky for you,\" said his wife, meaning that now he would not be\nmade to suffer for attempting to hoax her.  But she was too intensely\ninterested to pursue that matter further.  \"What in the world do you\nsuppose he means by it?\"\n\n\"Well, I should judge by his talk that he had been trying a good many\ndifferent things since he left college, and he hain't found just the\nthing he likes--or the thing that likes him.  It ain't so easy.  And\nnow he's got an idea that he can take hold of the paint and push it in\nother countries--push it in Mexico and push it in South America.  He's\na splendid Spanish scholar,\"--this was Lapham's version of Corey's\nmodest claim to a smattering of the language,--\"and he's been among the\nnatives enough to know their ways.  And he believes in the paint,\"\nadded the Colonel.\n\n\"I guess he believes in something else besides the paint,\" said Mrs.\nLapham.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Well, Silas Lapham, if you can't see NOW that he's after Irene, I\ndon't know what ever CAN open your eyes.  That's all.\"\n\nThe Colonel pretended to give the idea silent consideration, as if it\nhad not occurred to him before.  \"Well, then, all I've got to say is,\nthat he's going a good way round.  I don't say you're wrong, but if\nit's Irene, I don't see why he should want to go off to South America\nto get her.  And that's what he proposes to do.  I guess there's some\npaint about it too, Persis.  He says he believes in it,\"--the Colonel\ndevoutly lowered his voice,--\"and he's willing to take the agency on\nhis own account down there, and run it for a commission on what he can\nsell.\"\n\n\"Of course! He isn't going to take hold of it any way so as to feel\nbeholden to you.  He's got too much pride for that.\"\n\n\"He ain't going to take hold of it at all, if he don't mean paint in\nthe first place and Irene afterward.  I don't object to him, as I know,\neither way, but the two things won't mix; and I don't propose he shall\npull the wool over my eyes--or anybody else.  But, as far as heard\nfrom, up to date, he means paint first, last, and all the time.  At any\nrate, I'm going to take him on that basis.  He's got some pretty good\nideas about it, and he's been stirred up by this talk, just now, about\ngetting our manufactures into the foreign markets.  There's an\noverstock in everything, and we've got to get rid of it, or we've got\nto shut down till the home demand begins again.  We've had two or three\nsuch flurries before now, and they didn't amount to much.  They say we\ncan't extend our commerce under the high tariff system we've got now,\nbecause there ain't any sort of reciprocity on our side,--we want to\nhave the other fellows show all the reciprocity,--and the English have\ngot the advantage of us every time.  I don't know whether it's so or\nnot; but I don't see why it should apply to my paint.  Anyway, he wants\nto try it, and I've about made up my mind to let him.  Of course I\nain't going to let him take all the risk.  I believe in the paint TOO,\nand I shall pay his expenses anyway.\"\n\n\"So you want another partner after all?\" Mrs. Lapham could not forbear\nsaying.\n\n\"Yes, if that's your idea of a partner.  It isn't mine,\" returned her\nhusband dryly.\n\n\"Well, if you've made up your mind, Si, I suppose you're ready for\nadvice,\" said Mrs. Lapham.\n\nThe Colonel enjoyed this.  \"Yes, I am.  What have you got to say\nagainst it?\"\n\n\"I don't know as I've got anything.  I'm satisfied if you are.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"When is he going to start for South America?\"\n\n\"I shall take him into the office a while.  He'll get off some time in\nthe winter.  But he's got to know the business first.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed! Are you going to take him to board in the family?\"\n\n\"What are you after, Persis?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing! I presume he will feel free to visit in the family, even\nif he don't board with us.\"\n\n\"I presume he will.\"\n\n\"And if he don't use his privileges, do you think he'll be a fit person\nto manage your paint in South America?\"\n\nThe Colonel reddened consciously.  \"I'm not taking him on that basis.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, you are! You may pretend you ain't to yourself, but you\nmustn't pretend so to me.  Because I know you.\"\n\nThe Colonel laughed.  \"Pshaw!\" he said.\n\nMrs. Lapham continued: \"I don't see any harm in hoping that he'll take\na fancy to her.  But if you really think it won't do to mix the two\nthings, I advise you not to take Mr. Corey into the business.  It will\ndo all very well if he DOES take a fancy to her; but if he don't, you\nknow how you'll feel about it.  And I know you well enough, Silas, to\nknow that you can't do him justice if that happens.  And I don't think\nit's right you should take this step unless you're pretty sure.  I can\nsee that you've set your heart on this thing.\"\n\n\"I haven't set my heart on it at all,\" protested Lapham.\n\n\"And if you can't bring it about, you're going to feel unhappy over\nit,\" pursued his wife, regardless of his protest.\n\n\"Oh, very well,\" he said.  \"If you know more about what's in my mind\nthan I do, there's no use arguing, as I can see.\"\n\nHe got up, to carry off his consciousness, and sauntered out of the\ndoor on to his piazza.  He could see the young people down on the\nrocks, and his heart swelled in his breast.  He had always said that he\ndid not care what a man's family was, but the presence of young Corey\nas an applicant to him for employment, as his guest, as the possible\nsuitor of his daughter, was one of the sweetest flavours that he had\nyet tasted in his success.  He knew who the Coreys were very well, and,\nin his simple, brutal way, he had long hated their name as a symbol of\nsplendour which, unless he should live to see at least three\ngenerations of his descendants gilded with mineral paint, he could not\nhope to realise in his own.  He was acquainted in a business way with\nthe tradition of old Phillips Corey, and he had heard a great many\nthings about the Corey who had spent his youth abroad and his father's\nmoney everywhere, and done nothing but say smart things.  Lapham could\nnot see the smartness of some of them which had been repeated to him.\nOnce he had encountered the fellow, and it seemed to Lapham that the\ntall, slim, white-moustached man, with the slight stoop, was everything\nthat was offensively aristocratic.  He had bristled up aggressively at\nthe name when his wife told how she had made the acquaintance of the\nfellow's family the summer before, and he had treated the notion of\nyoung Corey's caring for Irene with the contempt which such a\nridiculous superstition deserved.  He had made up his mind about young\nCorey beforehand; yet when he met him he felt an instant liking for\nhim, which he frankly acknowledged, and he had begun to assume the\nburden of his wife's superstition, of which she seemed now ready to\naccuse him of being the inventor.\n\nNothing had moved his thick imagination like this day's events since\nthe girl who taught him spelling and grammar in the school at\nLumberville had said she would have him for her husband.\n\nThe dark figures, stationary on the rocks, began to move, and he could\nsee that they were coming toward the house.  He went indoors, so as not\nto appear to have been watching them.\n\n\n\nVIII.\n\n\nA WEEK after she had parted with her son at Bar Harbour, Mrs. Corey\nsuddenly walked in upon her husband in their house in Boston.  He was\nat breakfast, and he gave her the patronising welcome with which the\nhusband who has been staying in town all summer receives his wife when\nshe drops down upon him from the mountains or the sea-side. For a\nlittle moment she feels herself strange in the house, and suffers\nherself to be treated like a guest, before envy of his comfort vexes\nher back into possession and authority.  Mrs. Corey was a lady, and she\ndid not let her envy take the form of open reproach.\n\n\"Well, Anna, you find me here in the luxury you left me to.  How did\nyou leave the girls?\"\n\n\"The girls were well,\" said Mrs. Corey, looking absently at her\nhusband's brown velvet coat, in which he was so handsome.  No man had\never grown grey more beautifully.  His hair, while not remaining dark\nenough to form a theatrical contrast with his moustache, was yet some\nshades darker, and, in becoming a little thinner, it had become a\nlittle more gracefully wavy.  His skin had the pearly tint which that\nof elderly men sometimes assumes, and the lines which time had traced\nupon it were too delicate for the name of wrinkles.  He had never had\nany personal vanity, and there was no consciousness in his good looks\nnow.\n\n\"I am glad of that.  The boy I have with me,\" he returned; \"that is,\nwhen he IS with me.\"\n\n\"Why, where is he?\" demanded the mother.\n\n\"Probably carousing with the boon Lapham somewhere.  He left me\nyesterday afternoon to go and offer his allegiance to the Mineral Paint\nKing, and I haven't seen him since.\"\n\n\"Bromfield!\" cried Mrs. Corey.  \"Why didn't you stop him?\"\n\n\"Well, my dear, I'm not sure that it isn't a very good thing.\"\n\n\"A good thing? It's horrid!\"\n\n\"No, I don't think so.  It's decent.  Tom had found out--without\nconsulting the landscape, which I believe proclaims it everywhere----\"\n\n\"Hideous!\"\n\n\"That it's really a good thing; and he thinks that he has some ideas in\nregard to its dissemination in the parts beyond seas.\"\n\n\"Why shouldn't he go into something else?\" lamented the mother.\n\n\"I believe he has gone into nearly everything else and come out of it.\nSo there is a chance of his coming out of this.  But as I had nothing\nto suggest in place of it, I thought it best not to interfere.  In\nfact, what good would my telling him that mineral paint was nasty have\ndone? I dare say YOU told him it was nasty.\"\n\n\"Yes! I did.\"\n\n\"And you see with what effect, though he values your opinion three\ntimes as much as he values mine.  Perhaps you came up to tell him again\nthat it was nasty?\"\n\n\"I feel very unhappy about it.  He is throwing himself away.  Yes, I\nshould like to prevent it if I could!\"\n\nThe father shook his head.\n\n\"If Lapham hasn't prevented it, I fancy it's too late.  But there may\nbe some hopes of Lapham.  As for Tom's throwing himself away, I don't\nknow.  There's no question but he is one of the best fellows under the\nsun.  He's tremendously energetic, and he has plenty of the kind of\nsense which we call horse; but he isn't brilliant.  No, Tom is not\nbrilliant.  I don't think he would get on in a profession, and he's\ninstinctively kept out of everything of the kind.  But he has got to do\nsomething.  What shall he do? He says mineral paint, and really I don't\nsee why he shouldn't. If money is fairly and honestly earned, why\nshould we pretend to care what it comes out of, when we don't really\ncare? That superstition is exploded everywhere.\"\n\n\"Oh, it isn't the paint alone,\" said Mrs. Corey; and then she\nperceptibly arrested herself, and made a diversion in continuing: \"I\nwish he had married some one.\"\n\n\"With money?\" suggested her husband.  \"From time to time I have\nattempted Tom's corruption from that side, but I suspect Tom has a\nconscience against it, and I rather like him for it.  I married for\nlove myself,\" said Corey, looking across the table at his wife.\n\nShe returned his look tolerantly, though she felt it right to say,\n\"What nonsense!\"\n\n\"Besides,\" continued her husband, \"if you come to money, there is the\npaint princess.  She will have plenty.\"\n\n\"Ah, that's the worst of it,\" sighed the mother.  \"I suppose I could\nget on with the paint----\"\n\n\"But not with the princess? I thought you said she was a very pretty,\nwell-behaved girl?\"\n\n\"She is very pretty, and she is well-behaved; but there is nothing of\nher.  She is insipid; she is very insipid.\"\n\n\"But Tom seemed to like her flavour, such as it was?\"\n\n\"How can I tell? We were under a terrible obligation to them, and I\nnaturally wished him to be polite to them.  In fact, I asked him to be\nso.\"\n\n\"And he was too polite.\"\n\n\"I can't say that he was.  But there is no doubt that the child is\nextremely pretty.\"\n\n\"Tom says there are two of them.  Perhaps they will neutralise each\nother.\"\n\n\"Yes, there is another daughter,\" assented Mrs. Corey.  \"I don't see\nhow you can joke about such things, Bromfield,\" she added.\n\n\"Well, I don't either, my dear, to tell you the truth.  My hardihood\nsurprises me.  Here is a son of mine whom I see reduced to making his\nliving by a shrinkage in values.  It's very odd,\" interjected Corey,\n\"that some values should have this peculiarity of shrinking.  You never\nhear of values in a picture shrinking; but rents, stocks, real\nestate--all those values shrink abominably.  Perhaps it might be argued\nthat one should put all his values into pictures; I've got a good many\nof mine there.\"\n\n\"Tom needn't earn his living,\" said Mrs. Corey, refusing her husband's\njest.  \"There's still enough for all of us.\"\n\n\"That is what I have sometimes urged upon Tom.  I have proved to him\nthat with economy, and strict attention to business, he need do nothing\nas long as he lives.  Of course he would be somewhat restricted, and it\nwould cramp the rest of us; but it is a world of sacrifices and\ncompromises.  He couldn't agree with me, and he was not in the least\nmoved by the example of persons of quality in Europe, which I alleged\nin support of the life of idleness.  It appears that he wishes to do\nsomething--to do something for himself.  I am afraid that Tom is\nselfish.\"\n\nMrs. Corey smiled wanly.  Thirty years before, she had married the rich\nyoung painter in Rome, who said so much better things than he\npainted--charming things, just the things to please the fancy of a girl\nwho was disposed to take life a little too seriously and practically.\nShe saw him in a different light when she got him home to Boston; but\nhe had kept on saying the charming things, and he had not done much\nelse.  In fact, he had fulfilled the promise of his youth.  It was a\ngood trait in him that he was not actively but only passively\nextravagant.  He was not adventurous with his money; his tastes were as\nsimple as an Italian's; he had no expensive habits.  In the process of\ntime he had grown to lead a more and more secluded life.  It was hard\nto get him out anywhere, even to dinner.  His patience with their\nnarrowing circumstances had a pathos which she felt the more the more\nshe came into charge of their joint life.  At times it seemed too bad\nthat the children and their education and pleasures should cost so\nmuch.  She knew, besides, that if it had not been for them she would\nhave gone back to Rome with him, and lived princely there for less than\nit took to live respectably in Boston.\n\n\"Tom hasn't consulted me,\" continued his father, \"but he has consulted\nother people.  And he has arrived at the conclusion that mineral paint\nis a good thing to go into.  He has found out all about it, and about\nits founder or inventor.  It's quite impressive to hear him talk.  And\nif he must do something for himself, I don't see why his egotism\nshouldn't as well take that form as another.  Combined with the paint\nprincess, it isn't so agreeable; but that's only a remote possibility,\nfor which your principal ground is your motherly solicitude.  But even\nif it were probable and imminent, what could you do? The chief\nconsolation that we American parents have in these matters is that we\ncan do nothing.  If we were Europeans, even English, we should take\nsome cognisance of our children's love affairs, and in some measure\nteach their young affections how to shoot.  But it is our custom to\nignore them until they have shot, and then they ignore us.  We are\naltogether too delicate to arrange the marriages of our children; and\nwhen they have arranged them we don't like to say anything, for fear we\nshould only make bad worse.  The right way is for us to school\nourselves to indifference.  That is what the young people have to do\nelsewhere, and that is the only logical result of our position here.\nIt is absurd for us to have any feeling about what we don't interfere\nwith.\"\n\n\"Oh, people do interfere with their children's marriages very often,\"\nsaid Mrs. Corey.\n\n\"Yes, but only in a half-hearted way, so as not to make it disagreeable\nfor themselves if the marriages go on in spite of them, as they're\npretty apt to do.  Now, my idea is that I ought to cut Tom off with a\nshilling.  That would be very simple, and it would be economical.  But\nyou would never consent, and Tom wouldn't mind it.\"\n\n\"I think our whole conduct in regard to such things is wrong,\" said\nMrs. Corey.\n\n\"Oh, very likely.  But our whole civilisation is based upon it.  And\nwho is going to make a beginning? To which father in our acquaintance\nshall I go and propose an alliance for Tom with his daughter? I should\nfeel like an ass.  And will you go to some mother, and ask her sons in\nmarriage for our daughters? You would feel like a goose.  No; the only\nmotto for us is, Hands off altogether.\"\n\n\"I shall certainly speak to Tom when the time comes,\" said Mrs. Corey.\n\n\"And I shall ask leave to be absent from your discomfiture, my dear,\"\nanswered her husband.\n\nThe son returned that afternoon, and confessed his surprise at finding\nhis mother in Boston.  He was so frank that she had not quite the\ncourage to confess in turn why she had come, but trumped up an excuse.\n\n\"Well, mother,\" he said promptly, \"I have made an engagement with Mr.\nLapham.\"\n\n\"Have you, Tom?\" she asked faintly.\n\n\"Yes. For the present I am going to have charge of his foreign\ncorrespondence, and if I see my way to the advantage I expect to find\nin it, I am going out to manage that side of his business in South\nAmerica and Mexico.  He's behaved very handsomely about it.  He says\nthat if it appears for our common interest, he shall pay me a salary as\nwell as a commission.  I've talked with Uncle Jim, and he thinks it's a\ngood opening.\"\n\n\"Your Uncle Jim does?\" queried Mrs. Corey in amaze.\n\n\"Yes; I consulted him the whole way through, and I've acted on his\nadvice.\"\n\nThis seemed an incomprehensible treachery on her brother's part.\n\n\"Yes; I thought you would like to have me.  And besides, I couldn't\npossibly have gone to any one so well fitted to advise me.\"\n\nHis mother said nothing.  In fact, the mineral paint business, however\npainful its interest, was, for the moment, superseded by a more\npoignant anxiety.  She began to feel her way cautiously toward this.\n\n\"Have you been talking about your business with Mr. Lapham all night?\"\n\n\"Well, pretty much,\" said her son, with a guiltless laugh.  \"I went to\nsee him yesterday afternoon, after I had gone over the whole ground\nwith Uncle Jim, and Mr. Lapham asked me to go down with him and finish\nup.\"\n\n\"Down?\" repeated Mrs. Corey.  \"Yes, to Nantasket.  He has a cottage\ndown there.\"\n\n\"At Nantasket?\" Mrs. Corey knitted her brows a little.  \"What in the\nworld can a cottage at Nantasket be like?\"\n\n\"Oh, very much like a 'cottage' anywhere.  It has the usual allowance\nof red roof and veranda.  There are the regulation rocks by the sea;\nand the big hotels on the beach about a mile off, flaring away with\nelectric lights and roman-candles at night.  We didn't have them at\nNahant.\"\n\n\"No,\" said his mother.  \"Is Mrs. Lapham well? And her daughter?\"\n\n\"Yes, I think so,\" said the young man.  \"The young ladies walked me\ndown to the rocks in the usual way after dinner, and then I came back\nand talked paint with Mr. Lapham till midnight.  We didn't settle\nanything till this morning coming up on the boat.\"\n\n\"What sort of people do they seem to be at home?\"\n\n\"What sort? Well, I don't know that I noticed.\" Mrs. Corey permitted\nherself the first part of a sigh of relief; and her son laughed, but\napparently not at her.  \"They're just reading Middlemarch.  They say\nthere's so much talk about it.  Oh, I suppose they're very good people.\nThey seemed to be on very good terms with each other.\"\n\n\"I suppose it's the plain sister who's reading Middlemarch.\"\n\n\"Plain? Is she plain?\" asked the young man, as if searching his\nconsciousness.  \"Yes, it's the older one who does the reading,\napparently.  But I don't believe that even she overdoes it.  They like\nto talk better.  They reminded me of Southern people in that.\" The\nyoung man smiled, as if amused by some of his impressions of the Lapham\nfamily.  \"The living, as the country people call it, is tremendously\ngood.  The Colonel--he's a colonel--talked of the coffee as his wife's\ncoffee, as if she had personally made it in the kitchen, though I\nbelieve it was merely inspired by her.  And there was everything in the\nhouse that money could buy.  But money has its limitations.\"\n\nThis was a fact which Mrs. Corey was beginning to realise more and more\nunpleasantly in her own life; but it seemed to bring her a certain\ncomfort in its application to the Laphams.  \"Yes, there is a point\nwhere taste has to begin,\" she said.\n\n\"They seemed to want to apologise to me for not having more books,\"\nsaid Corey.  \"I don't know why they should.  The Colonel said they\nbought a good many books, first and last; but apparently they don't\ntake them to the sea-side.\"\n\n\"I dare say they NEVER buy a NEW book.  I've met some of these moneyed\npeople lately, and they lavish on every conceivable luxury, and then\nborrow books, and get them in the cheap paper editions.\"\n\n\"I fancy that's the way with the Lapham family,\" said the young man,\nsmilingly.  \"But they are very good people.  The other daughter is\nhumorous.\"\n\n\"Humorous?\" Mrs. Corey knitted her brows in some perplexity.  \"Do you\nmean like Mrs. Sayre?\" she asked, naming the lady whose name must come\ninto every Boston mind when humour is mentioned.\n\n\"Oh no; nothing like that.  She never says anything that you can\nremember; nothing in flashes or ripples; nothing the least literary.\nBut it's a sort of droll way of looking at things; or a droll medium\nthrough which things present themselves.  I don't know.  She tells what\nshe's seen, and mimics a little.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Mrs. Corey coldly.  After a moment she asked: \"And is Miss\nIrene as pretty as ever?\"\n\n\"She's a wonderful complexion,\" said the son unsatisfactorily.  \"I\nshall want to be by when father and Colonel Lapham meet,\" he added,\nwith a smile.\n\n\"Ah, yes, your father!\" said the mother, in that way in which a wife at\nonce compassionates and censures her husband to their children.\n\n\"Do you think it's really going to be a trial to him?\" asked the young\nman quickly.\n\n\"No, no, I can't say it is.  But I confess I wish it was some other\nbusiness, Tom.\"\n\n\"Well, mother, I don't see why.  The principal thing looked at now is\nthe amount of money; and while I would rather starve than touch a\ndollar that was dirty with any sort of dishonesty----\"\n\n\"Of course you would, my son!\" interposed his mother proudly.\n\n\"I shouldn't at all mind its having a little mineral paint on it.  I'll\nuse my influence with Colonel Lapham--if I ever have any--to have his\npaint scraped off the landscape.\"\n\n\"I suppose you won't begin till the autumn.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I shall,\" said the son, laughing at his mother's simple\nignorance of business.  \"I shall begin to-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"To-morrow morning!\"\n\n\"Yes. I've had my desk appointed already, and I shall be down there at\nnine in the morning to take possession.\"\n\n\"Tom,\" cried his mother, \"why do you think Mr. Lapham has taken you\ninto business so readily? I've always heard that it was so hard for\nyoung men to get in.\"\n\n\"And do you think I found it easy with him? We had about twelve hours'\nsolid talk.\"\n\n\"And you don't suppose it was any sort of--personal consideration?\"\n\n\"Why, I don't know exactly what you mean, mother.  I suppose he likes\nme.\"\n\nMrs. Corey could not say just what she meant.  She answered,\nineffectually enough--\n\n\"Yes. You wouldn't like it to be a favour, would you?\"\n\n\"I think he's a man who may be trusted to look after his own interest.\nBut I don't mind his beginning by liking me.  It'll be my own fault if\nI don't make myself essential to him.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Corey.\n\n\"Well,\" demanded her husband, at their first meeting after her\ninterview with their son, \"what did you say to Tom?\"\n\n\"Very little, if anything.  I found him with his mind made up, and it\nwould only have distressed him if I had tried to change it.\"\n\n\"That is precisely what I said, my dear.\"\n\n\"Besides, he had talked the matter over fully with James, and seems to\nhave been advised by him.  I can't understand James.\"\n\n\"Oh! it's in regard to the paint, and not the princess, that he's made\nup his mind.  Well, I think you were wise to let him alone, Anna.  We\nrepresent a faded tradition.  We don't really care what business a man\nis in, so it is large enough, and he doesn't advertise offensively; but\nwe think it fine to affect reluctance.\"\n\n\"Do you really feel so, Bromfield?\" asked his wife seriously.\n\n\"Certainly I do.  There was a long time in my misguided youth when I\nsupposed myself some sort of porcelain; but it's a relief to be of the\ncommon clay, after all, and to know it.  If I get broken, I can be\neasily replaced.\"\n\n\"If Tom must go into such a business,\" said Mrs. Corey, \"I'm glad James\napproves of it.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid it wouldn't matter to Tom if he didn't; and I don't know\nthat I should care,\" said Corey, betraying the fact that he had perhaps\nhad a good deal of his brother-in-law's judgment in the course of his\nlife.  \"You had better consult him in regard to Tom's marrying the\nprincess.\"\n\n\"There is no necessity at present for that,\" said Mrs. Corey, with\ndignity.  After a moment, she asked, \"Should you feel quite so easy if\nit were a question of that, Bromfield?\"\n\n\"It would be a little more personal.\"\n\n\"You feel about it as I do.  Of course, we have both lived too long,\nand seen too much of the world, to suppose we can control such things.\nThe child is good, I haven't the least doubt, and all those things can\nbe managed so that they wouldn't disgrace us.  But she has had a\ncertain sort of bringing up.  I should prefer Tom to marry a girl with\nanother sort, and this business venture of his increases the chances\nthat he won't. That's all.\"\n\n\"''Tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door, but 'twill\nserve.'\"\n\n\"I shouldn't like it.\"\n\n\"Well, it hasn't happened yet.\"\n\n\"Ah, you never can realise anything beforehand.\"\n\n\"Perhaps that has saved me some suffering.  But you have at least the\nconsolation of two anxieties at once.  I always find that a great\nadvantage.  You can play one off against the other.\"\n\nMrs. Corey drew a long breath as if she did not experience the\nsuggested consolation; and she arranged to quit, the following\nafternoon, the scene of her defeat, which she had not had the courage\nto make a battlefield.  Her son went down to see her off on the boat,\nafter spending his first day at his desk in Lapham's office.  He was in\na gay humour, and she departed in a reflected gleam of his good\nspirits.  He told her all about it, as he sat talking with her at the\nstern of the boat, lingering till the last moment, and then stepping\nashore, with as little waste of time as Lapham himself, on the\ngang-plank which the deck-hands had laid hold of.  He touched his hat\nto her from the wharf to reassure her of his escape from being carried\naway with her, and the next moment his smiling face hid itself in the\ncrowd.\n\nHe walked on smiling up the long wharf, encumbered with trucks and\nhacks and piles of freight, and, taking his way through the deserted\nbusiness streets beyond this bustle, made a point of passing the door\nof Lapham's warehouse, on the jambs of which his name and paint were\nlettered in black on a square ground of white.  The door was still\nopen, and Corey loitered a moment before it, tempted to go upstairs and\nfetch away some foreign letters which he had left on his desk, and\nwhich he thought he might finish up at home.  He was in love with his\nwork, and he felt the enthusiasm for it which nothing but the work we\ncan do well inspires in us.  He believed that he had found his place in\nthe world, after a good deal of looking, and he had the relief, the\nrepose, of fitting into it.  Every little incident of the momentous,\nuneventful day was a pleasure in his mind, from his sitting down at his\ndesk, to which Lapham's boy brought him the foreign letters, till his\nrising from it an hour ago.  Lapham had been in view within his own\noffice, but he had given Corey no formal reception, and had, in fact,\nnot spoken to him till toward the end of the forenoon, when he suddenly\ncame out of his den with some more letters in his hand, and after a\nbrief \"How d'ye do?\" had spoken a few words about them, and left them\nwith him.  He was in his shirt-sleeves again, and his sanguine person\nseemed to radiate the heat with which he suffered.  He did not go out\nto lunch, but had it brought to him in his office, where Corey saw him\neating it before he left his own desk to go out and perch on a swinging\nseat before the long counter of a down-town restaurant.  He observed\nthat all the others lunched at twelve, and he resolved to anticipate\nhis usual hour.  When he returned, the pretty girl who had been\nclicking away at a type-writer all the morning was neatly putting out\nof sight the evidences of pie from the table where her machine stood,\nand was preparing to go on with her copying.  In his office Lapham lay\nasleep in his arm-chair, with a newspaper over his face.\n\nNow, while Corey lingered at the entrance to the stairway, these two\ncame down the stairs together, and he heard Lapham saying, \"Well, then,\nyou better get a divorce.\"\n\nHe looked red and excited, and the girl's face, which she veiled at\nsight of Corey, showed traces of tears.  She slipped round him into the\nstreet.\n\nBut Lapham stopped, and said, with the show of no feeling but surprise:\n\"Hello, Corey! Did you want to go up?\"\n\n\"Yes; there were some letters I hadn't quite got through with.\"\n\n\"You'll find Dennis up there.  But I guess you better let them go till\nto-morrow. I always make it a rule to stop work when I'm done.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you're right,\" said Corey, yielding.\n\n\"Come along down as far as the boat with me.  There's a little matter I\nwant to talk over with you.\"\n\nIt was a business matter, and related to Corey's proposed connection\nwith the house.\n\nThe next day the head book-keeper, who lunched at the long counter of\nthe same restaurant with Corey, began to talk with him about Lapham.\nWalker had not apparently got his place by seniority; though with his\nforehead, bald far up toward the crown, and his round smooth face, one\nmight have taken him for a plump elder, if he had not looked equally\nlike a robust infant.  The thick drabbish yellow moustache was what\narrested decision in either direction, and the prompt vigour of all his\nmovements was that of a young man of thirty, which was really Walker's\nage.  He knew, of course, who Corey was, and he had waited for a man\nwho might look down on him socially to make the overtures toward\nsomething more than business acquaintance; but, these made, he was\nreadily responsive, and drew freely on his philosophy of Lapham and his\naffairs.\n\n\"I think about the only difference between people in this world is that\nsome know what they want, and some don't. Well, now,\" said Walker,\nbeating the bottom of his salt-box to make the salt come out, \"the old\nman knows what he wants every time.  And generally he gets it.  Yes,\nsir, he generally gets it.  He knows what he's about, but I'll be\nblessed if the rest of us do half the time.  Anyway, we don't till he's\nready to let us.  You take my position in most business houses.  It's\nconfidential.  The head book-keeper knows right along pretty much\neverything the house has got in hand.  I'll give you my word I don't.\nHe may open up to you a little more in your department, but, as far as\nthe rest of us go, he don't open up any more than an oyster on a hot\nbrick.  They say he had a partner once; I guess he's dead.  I wouldn't\nlike to be the old man's partner.  Well, you see, this paint of his is\nlike his heart's blood.  Better not try to joke him about it.  I've\nseen people come in occasionally and try it.  They didn't get much fun\nout of it.\"\n\nWhile he talked, Walker was plucking up morsels from his plate, tearing\noff pieces of French bread from the long loaf, and feeding them into\nhis mouth in an impersonal way, as if he were firing up an engine.\n\n\"I suppose he thinks,\" suggested Corey, \"that if he doesn't tell,\nnobody else will.\"\n\nWalker took a draught of beer from his glass, and wiped the foam from\nhis moustache.\n\n\"Oh, but he carries it too far! It's a weakness with him.  He's just so\nabout everything.  Look at the way he keeps it up about that\ntype-writer girl of his.  You'd think she was some princess travelling\nincognito.  There isn't one of us knows who she is, or where she came\nfrom, or who she belongs to.  He brought her and her machine into the\noffice one morning, and set 'em down at a table, and that's all there\nis about it, as far as we're concerned.  It's pretty hard on the girl,\nfor I guess she'd like to talk; and to any one that didn't know the old\nman----\" Walker broke off and drained his glass of what was left in it.\n\nCorey thought of the words he had overheard from Lapham to the girl.\nBut he said, \"She seems to be kept pretty busy.\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" said Walker; \"there ain't much loafing round the place, in\nany of the departments, from the old man's down.  That's just what I\nsay.  He's got to work just twice as hard, if he wants to keep\neverything in his own mind.  But he ain't afraid of work.  That's one\ngood thing about him.  And Miss Dewey has to keep step with the rest of\nus.  But she don't look like one that would take to it naturally.  Such\na pretty girl as that generally thinks she does enough when she looks\nher prettiest.\"\n\n\"She's a pretty girl,\" said Corey, non-committally. \"But I suppose a\ngreat many pretty girls have to earn their living.\"\n\n\"Don't any of 'em like to do it,\" returned the book-keeper.  \"They\nthink it's a hardship, and I don't blame 'em. They have got a right to\nget married, and they ought to have the chance.  And Miss Dewey's\nsmart, too.  She's as bright as a biscuit.  I guess she's had trouble.\nI shouldn't be much more than half surprised if Miss Dewey wasn't Miss\nDewey, or hadn't always been.  Yes, sir,\" continued the book-keeper,\nwho prolonged the talk as they walked back to Lapham's warehouse\ntogether, \"I don't know exactly what it is,--it isn't any one thing in\nparticular,--but I should say that girl had been married.  I wouldn't\nspeak so freely to any of the rest, Mr. Corey,--I want you to\nunderstand that,--and it isn't any of my business, anyway; but that's\nmy opinion.\"\n\nCorey made no reply, as he walked beside the book-keeper, who\ncontinued--\n\n\"It's curious what a difference marriage makes in people.  Now, I know\nthat I don't look any more like a bachelor of my age than I do like the\nman in the moon, and yet I couldn't say where the difference came in,\nto save me.  And it's just so with a woman.  The minute you catch sight\nof her face, there's something in it that tells you whether she's\nmarried or not.  What do you suppose it is?\"\n\n\"I'm sure I don't know,\" said Corey, willing to laugh away the topic.\n\"And from what I read occasionally of some people who go about\nrepeating their happiness, I shouldn't say that the intangible\nevidences were always unmistakable.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course,\" admitted Walker, easily surrendering his position.\n\"All signs fail in dry weather.  Hello! What's that?\" He caught Corey\nby the arm, and they both stopped.\n\nAt a corner, half a block ahead of them, the summer noon solitude of\nthe place was broken by a bit of drama.  A man and woman issued from\nthe intersecting street, and at the moment of coming into sight the\nman, who looked like a sailor, caught the woman by the arm, as if to\ndetain her.  A brief struggle ensued, the woman trying to free herself,\nand the man half coaxing, half scolding.  The spectators could now see\nthat he was drunk; but before they could decide whether it was a case\nfor their interference or not, the woman suddenly set both hands\nagainst the man's breast and gave him a quick push.  He lost his\nfooting and tumbled into a heap in the gutter.  The woman faltered an\ninstant, as if to see whether he was seriously hurt, and then turned\nand ran.\n\nWhen Corey and the book-keeper re-entered the office, Miss Dewey had\nfinished her lunch, and was putting a sheet of paper into her\ntype-writer. She looked up at them with her eyes of turquoise blue,\nunder her low white forehead, with the hair neatly rippled over it, and\nthen began to beat the keys of her machine.\n\n\n\nIX.\n\n\nLAPHAM had the pride which comes of self-making, and he would not\nopenly lower his crest to the young fellow he had taken into his\nbusiness.  He was going to be obviously master in his own place to\nevery one; and during the hours of business he did nothing to\ndistinguish Corey from the half-dozen other clerks and book-keepers in\nthe outer office, but he was not silent about the fact that Bromfield\nCorey's son had taken a fancy to come to him.  \"Did you notice that\nfellow at the desk facing my type-writer girl? Well, sir, that's the\nson of Bromfield Corey--old Phillips Corey's grandson.  And I'll say\nthis for him, that there isn't a man in the office that looks after his\nwork better.  There isn't anything he's too good for.  He's right here\nat nine every morning, before the clock gets in the word.  I guess it's\nhis grandfather coming out in him.  He's got charge of the foreign\ncorrespondence.  We're pushing the paint everywhere.\" He flattered\nhimself that he did not lug the matter in.  He had been warned against\nthat by his wife, but he had the right to do Corey justice, and his\nbrag took the form of illustration.  \"Talk about training for\nbusiness--I tell you it's all in the man himself! I used to believe in\nwhat old Horace Greeley said about college graduates being the poorest\nkind of horned cattle; but I've changed my mind a little.  You take\nthat fellow Corey.  He's been through Harvard, and he's had about every\nadvantage that a fellow could have.  Been everywhere, and talks half a\ndozen languages like English.  I suppose he's got money enough to live\nwithout lifting a hand, any more than his father does; son of Bromfield\nCorey, you know.  But the thing was in him.  He's a natural-born\nbusiness man; and I've had many a fellow with me that had come up out\nof the street, and worked hard all his life, without ever losing his\noriginal opposition to the thing.  But Corey likes it.  I believe the\nfellow would like to stick at that desk of his night and day.  I don't\nknow where he got it.  I guess it must be his grandfather, old Phillips\nCorey; it often skips a generation, you know.  But what I say is, a\nthing has got to be born in a man; and if it ain't born in him, all the\nprivations in the world won't put it there, and if it is, all the\ncollege training won't take it out.\"\n\nSometimes Lapham advanced these ideas at his own table, to a guest whom\nhe had brought to Nantasket for the night.  Then he suffered exposure\nand ridicule at the hands of his wife, when opportunity offered.  She\nwould not let him bring Corey down to Nantasket at all.\n\n\"No, indeed!\" she said.  \"I am not going to have them think we're\nrunning after him.  If he wants to see Irene, he can find out ways of\ndoing it for himself.\"\n\n\"Who wants him to see Irene?\" retorted the Colonel angrily.\n\n\"I do,\" said Mrs. Lapham.  \"And I want him to see her without any of\nyour connivance, Silas.  I'm not going to have it said that I put my\ngirls at anybody.  Why don't you invite some of your other clerks?\"\n\n\"He ain't just like the other clerks.  He's going to take charge of a\npart of the business.  It's quite another thing.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed!\" said Mrs. Lapham vexatiously.  \"Then you ARE going to\ntake a partner.\"\n\n\"I shall ask him down if I choose!\" returned the Colonel, disdaining\nher insinuation.\n\nHis wife laughed with the fearlessness of a woman who knows her husband.\n\n\"But you won't choose when you've thought it over, Si.\" Then she\napplied an emollient to his chafed surface.  \"Don't you suppose I feel\nas you do about it? I know just how proud you are, and I'm not going to\nhave you do anything that will make you feel meeching afterward.  You\njust let things take their course.  If he wants Irene, he's going to\nfind out some way of seeing her; and if he don't, all the plotting and\nplanning in the world isn't going to make him.\"\n\n\"Who's plotting?\" again retorted the Colonel, shuddering at the\nutterance of hopes and ambitions which a man hides with shame, but a\nwoman talks over as freely and coolly as if they were items of a\nmilliner's bill.\n\n\"Oh, not you!\" exulted his wife.  \"I understand what you want.  You\nwant to get this fellow, who is neither partner nor clerk, down here to\ntalk business with him.  Well, now, you just talk business with him at\nthe office.\"\n\nThe only social attention which Lapham succeeded in offering Corey was\nto take him in his buggy, now and then, for a spin out over the\nMill-dam. He kept the mare in town, and on a pleasant afternoon he\nliked to knock off early, as he phrased it, and let the mare out a\nlittle.  Corey understood something about horses, though in a\npassionless way, and he would have preferred to talk business when\nobliged to talk horse.  But he deferred to his business superior with\nthe sense of discipline which is innate in the apparently insubordinate\nAmerican nature.  If Corey could hardly have helped feeling the social\ndifference between Lapham and himself, in his presence he silenced his\ntraditions, and showed him all the respect that he could have exacted\nfrom any of his clerks.  He talked horse with him, and when the Colonel\nwished he talked house.  Besides himself and his paint Lapham had not\nmany other topics; and if he had a choice between the mare and the\nedifice on the water side of Beacon Street, it was just now the latter.\nSometimes, in driving in or out, he stopped at the house, and made\nCorey his guest there, if he might not at Nantasket; and one day it\nhappened that the young man met Irene there again.  She had come up\nwith her mother alone, and they were in the house, interviewing the\ncarpenter as before, when the Colonel jumped out of his buggy and cast\nanchor at the pavement.  More exactly, Mrs. Lapham was interviewing the\ncarpenter, and Irene was sitting in the bow-window on a trestle, and\nlooking out at the driving.  She saw him come up with her father, and\nbowed and blushed.  Her father went on up-stairs to find her mother,\nand Corey pulled up another trestle which he found in the back part of\nthe room.  The first floorings had been laid throughout the house, and\nthe partitions had been lathed so that one could realise the shape of\nthe interior.\n\n\"I suppose you will sit at this window a good deal,\" said the young man.\n\n\"Yes, I think it will be very nice.  There's so much more going on than\nthere is in the Square.\"\n\n\"It must be very interesting to you to see the house grow.\"\n\n\"It is.  Only it doesn't seem to grow so fast as I expected.\"\n\n\"Why, I'm amazed at the progress your carpenter has made every time I\ncome.\"\n\nThe girl looked down, and then lifting her eyes she said, with a sort\nof timorous appeal--\n\n\"I've been reading that book since you were down at Nantasket.\"\n\n\"Book?\" repeated Corey, while she reddened with disappointment.  \"Oh\nyes.  Middlemarch.  Did you like it?\"\n\n\"I haven't got through with it yet.  Pen has finished it.\"\n\n\"What does she think of it?\"\n\n\"Oh, I think she likes it very well.  I haven't heard her talk about it\nmuch.  Do you like it?\"\n\n\"Yes; I liked it immensely.  But it's several years since I read it.\"\n\n\"I didn't know it was so old.  It's just got into the Seaside Library,\"\nshe urged, with a little sense of injury in her tone.\n\n\"Oh, it hasn't been out such a very great while,\" said Corey politely.\n\"It came a little before DANIEL DERONDA.\"\n\nThe girl was again silent.  She followed the curl of a shaving on the\nfloor with the point of her parasol.\n\n\"Do you like that Rosamond Vincy?\" she asked, without looking up.\n\nCorey smiled in his kind way.\n\n\"I didn't suppose she was expected to have any friends.  I can't say I\nliked her.  But I don't think I disliked her so much as the author\ndoes.  She's pretty hard on her good-looking\"--he was going to say\ngirls, but as if that might have been rather personal, he\nsaid--\"people.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's what Pen says.  She says she doesn't give her any chance\nto be good.  She says she should have been just as bad as Rosamond if\nshe had been in her place.\"\n\nThe young man laughed.  \"Your sister is very satirical, isn't she?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Irene, still intent upon the convolutions of the\nshaving.  \"She keeps us laughing.  Papa thinks there's nobody that can\ntalk like her.\" She gave the shaving a little toss from her, and took\nthe parasol up across her lap.  The unworldliness of the Lapham girls\ndid not extend to their dress; Irene's costume was very stylish, and\nshe governed her head and shoulders stylishly.  \"We are going to have\nthe back room upstairs for a music-room and library,\" she said abruptly.\n\n\"Yes?\" returned Corey.  \"I should think that would be charming.\"\n\n\"We expected to have book-cases, but the architect wants to build the\nshelves in.\"\n\nThe fact seemed to be referred to Corey for his comment.\n\n\"It seems to me that would be the best way.  They'll look like part of\nthe room then.  You can make them low, and hang your pictures above\nthem.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's what he said.\" The girl looked out of the window in\nadding, \"I presume with nice bindings it will look very well.\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing furnishes a room like books.\"\n\n\"No. There will have to be a good many of them.\"\n\n\"That depends upon the size of your room and the number of your\nshelves.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course! I presume,\" said Irene, thoughtfully, \"we shall have to\nhave Gibbon.\"\n\n\"If you want to read him,\" said Corey, with a laugh of sympathy for an\nimaginable joke.\n\n\"We had a great deal about him at school.  I believe we had one of his\nbooks.  Mine's lost, but Pen will remember.\"\n\nThe young man looked at her, and then said, seriously, \"You'll want\nGreene, of course, and Motley, and Parkman.\"\n\n\"Yes. What kind of writers are they?\"\n\n\"They're historians too.\"\n\n\"Oh yes; I remember now.  That's what Gibbon was.  Is it Gibbon or\nGibbons?\"\n\nThe young man decided the point with apparently superfluous delicacy.\n\"Gibbon, I think.\"\n\n\"There used to be so many of them,\" said Irene gaily.  \"I used to get\nthem mixed up with each other, and I couldn't tell them from the poets.\nShould you want to have poetry?\"\n\n\"Yes; I suppose some edition of the English poets.\"\n\n\"We don't any of us like poetry.  Do you like it?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I don't very much,\" Corey owned.  \"But, of course, there\nwas a time when Tennyson was a great deal more to me than he is now.\"\n\n\"We had something about him at school too.  I think I remember the\nname.  I think we ought to have ALL the American poets.\"\n\n\"Well, not all.  Five or six of the best: you want Longfellow and\nBryant and Whittier and Holmes and Emerson and Lowell.\"\n\nThe girl listened attentively, as if making mental note of the names.\n\n\"And Shakespeare,\" she added.  \"Don't you like Shakespeare's plays?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, very much.\"\n\n\"I used to be perfectly crazy about his plays.  Don't you think\n'Hamlet' is splendid? We had ever so much about Shakespeare.  Weren't\nyou perfectly astonished when you found out how many other plays of his\nthere were? I always thought there was nothing but 'Hamlet' and 'Romeo\nand Juliet' and 'Macbeth' and 'Richard III.' and 'King Lear,' and that\none that Robeson and Crane have--oh yes! 'Comedy of Errors.'\"\n\n\"Those are the ones they usually play,\" said Corey.\n\n\"I presume we shall have to have Scott's works,\" said Irene, returning\nto the question of books.\n\n\"Oh yes.\"\n\n\"One of the girls used to think he was GREAT.  She was always talking\nabout Scott.\" Irene made a pretty little amiably contemptuous mouth.\n\"He isn't American, though?\" she suggested.\n\n\"No,\" said Corey; \"he's Scotch, I believe.\"\n\nIrene passed her glove over her forehead.  \"I always get him mixed up\nwith Cooper.  Well, papa has got to get them.  If we have a library, we\nhave got to have books in it.  Pen says it's perfectly ridiculous\nhaving one.  But papa thinks whatever the architect says is right.  He\nfought him hard enough at first.  I don't see how any one can keep the\npoets and the historians and novelists separate in their mind.  Of\ncourse papa will buy them if we say so.  But I don't see how I'm ever\ngoing to tell him which ones.\" The joyous light faded out of her face\nand left it pensive.\n\n\"Why, if you like,\" said the young man, taking out his pencil, \"I'll\nput down the names we've been talking about.\"\n\nHe clapped himself on his breast pockets to detect some lurking scrap\nof paper.\n\n\"Will you?\" she cried delightedly.  \"Here! take one of my cards,\" and\nshe pulled out her card-case. \"The carpenter writes on a three-cornered\nblock and puts it into his pocket, and it's so uncomfortable he can't\nhelp remembering it.  Pen says she's going to adopt the\nthree-cornered-block plan with papa.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Corey.  \"I believe I'll use your card.\" He crossed\nover to her, and after a moment sat down on the trestle beside her.\nShe looked over the card as he wrote.  \"Those are the ones we\nmentioned, but perhaps I'd better add a few others.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you,\" she said, when he had written the card full on both\nsides.  \"He has got to get them in the nicest binding, too.  I shall\ntell him about their helping to furnish the room, and then he can't\nobject.\" She remained with the card, looking at it rather wistfully.\n\nPerhaps Corey divined her trouble of mind.  \"If he will take that to\nany bookseller, and tell him what bindings he wants, he will fill the\norder for him.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you very much,\" she said, and put the card back into her\ncard-case with great apparent relief.  Then she turned her lovely face\ntoward the young man, beaming with the triumph a woman feels in any bit\nof successful manoeuvring, and began to talk with recovered gaiety of\nother things, as if, having got rid of a matter annoying out of all\nproportion to its importance, she was now going to indemnify herself.\n\nCorey did not return to his own trestle.  She found another shaving\nwithin reach of her parasol, and began poking that with it, and trying\nto follow it through its folds.  Corey watched her a while.\n\n\"You seem to have a great passion for playing with shavings,\" he said.\n\"Is it a new one?\"\n\n\"New what?\"\n\n\"Passion.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" she said, dropping her eyelids, and keeping on with her\neffort.  She looked shyly aslant at him.  \"Perhaps you don't approve of\nplaying with shavings?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I do.  I admire it very much.  But it seems rather difficult.\nI've a great ambition to put my foot on the shaving's tail and hold it\nfor you.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the girl.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said the young man.  He did so, and now she ran her\nparasol point easily through it.  They looked at each other and\nlaughed.  \"That was wonderful.  Would you like to try another?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"No, I thank you,\" she replied.  \"I think one will do.\"\n\nThey both laughed again, for whatever reason or no reason, and then the\nyoung girl became sober.  To a girl everything a young man does is of\nsignificance; and if he holds a shaving down with his foot while she\npokes through it with her parasol, she must ask herself what he means\nby it.\n\n\"They seem to be having rather a long interview with the carpenter\nto-day,\" said Irene, looking vaguely toward the ceiling.  She turned\nwith polite ceremony to Corey.  \"I'm afraid you're letting them keep\nyou.  You mustn't.\"\n\n\"Oh no.  You're letting me stay,\" he returned.\n\nShe bridled and bit her lip for pleasure.  \"I presume they will be down\nbefore a great while.  Don't you like the smell of the wood and the\nmortar? It's so fresh.\"\n\n\"Yes, it's delicious.\" He bent forward and picked up from the floor the\nshaving with which they had been playing, and put it to his nose.\n\"It's like a flower.  May I offer it to you?\" he asked, as if it had\nbeen one.\n\n\"Oh, thank you, thank you!\" She took it from him and put it into her\nbelt, and then they both laughed once more.\n\nSteps were heard descending.  When the elder people reached the floor\nwhere they were sitting, Corey rose and presently took his leave.\n\n\"What makes you so solemn, 'Rene?\" asked Mrs. Lapham.\n\n\"Solemn?\" echoed the girl.  \"I'm not a BIT solemn.  What CAN you mean?\"\n\nCorey dined at home that evening, and as he sat looking across the\ntable at his father, he said, \"I wonder what the average literature of\nnon-cultivated people is.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said the elder, \"I suspect the average is pretty low even with\ncultivated people.  You don't read a great many books yourself, Tom.\"\n\n\"No, I don't,\" the young man confessed.  \"I read more books when I was\nwith Stanton, last winter, than I had since I was a boy.  But I read\nthem because I must--there was nothing else to do.  It wasn't because I\nwas fond of reading.  Still I think I read with some sense of\nliterature and the difference between authors.  I don't suppose that\npeople generally do that; I have met people who had read books without\ntroubling themselves to find out even the author's name, much less\ntrying to decide upon his quality.  I suppose that's the way the vast\nmajority of people read.\"\n\n\"Yes. If authors were not almost necessarily recluses, and ignorant of\nthe ignorance about them, I don't see how they could endure it.  Of\ncourse they are fated to be overwhelmed by oblivion at last, poor\nfellows; but to see it weltering all round them while they are in the\nvery act of achieving immortality must be tremendously discouraging.  I\ndon't suppose that we who have the habit of reading, and at least a\nnodding acquaintance with literature, can imagine the bestial darkness\nof the great mass of people--even people whose houses are rich and\nwhose linen is purple and fine.  But occasionally we get glimpses of\nit.  I suppose you found the latest publications lying all about in\nLapham cottage when you were down there?\"\n\nYoung Corey laughed.  \"It wasn't exactly cumbered with them.\"\n\n\"No?\"\n\n\"To tell the truth, I don't suppose they ever buy books.  The young\nladies get novels that they hear talked of out of the circulating\nlibrary.\"\n\n\"Had they knowledge enough to be ashamed of their ignorance?\"\n\n\"Yes, in certain ways--to a certain degree.\"\n\n\"It's a curious thing, this thing we call civilisation,\" said the elder\nmusingly.  \"We think it is an affair of epochs and of nations.  It's\nreally an affair of individuals.  One brother will be civilised and the\nother a barbarian.  I've occasionally met young girls who were so\nbrutally, insolently, wilfully indifferent to the arts which make\ncivilisation that they ought to have been clothed in the skins of wild\nbeasts and gone about barefoot with clubs over their shoulders.  Yet\nthey were of polite origin, and their parents were at least respectful\nof the things that these young animals despised.\"\n\n\"I don't think that is exactly the case with the Lapham family,\" said\nthe son, smiling.  \"The father and mother rather apologised about not\ngetting time to read, and the young ladies by no means scorned it.\"\n\n\"They are quite advanced!\"\n\n\"They are going to have a library in their Beacon Street house.\"\n\n\"Oh, poor things! How are they ever going to get the books together?\"\n\n\"Well, sir,\" said the son, colouring a little, \"I have been indirectly\napplied to for help.\"\n\n\"You, Tom!\" His father dropped back in his chair and laughed.\n\n\"I recommended the standard authors,\" said the son.\n\n\"Oh, I never supposed your PRUDENCE would be at fault, Tom!\"\n\n\"But seriously,\" said the young man, generously smiling in sympathy\nwith his father's enjoyment, \"they're not unintelligent people.  They\nare very quick, and they are shrewd and sensible.\"\n\n\"I have no doubt that some of the Sioux are so.  But that is not saying\nthat they are civilised.  All civilisation comes through literature\nnow, especially in our country.  A Greek got his civilisation by\ntalking and looking, and in some measure a Parisian may still do it.\nBut we, who live remote from history and monuments, we must read or we\nmust barbarise.  Once we were softened, if not polished, by religion;\nbut I suspect that the pulpit counts for much less now in civilising.\"\n\n\"They're enormous devourers of newspapers, and theatre-goers; and they\ngo a great deal to lectures.  The Colonel prefers them with the\nstereopticon.\"\n\n\"They might get a something in that way,\" said the elder thoughtfully.\n\"Yes, I suppose one must take those things into account--especially the\nnewspapers and the lectures.  I doubt if the theatre is a factor in\ncivilisation among us.  I dare say it doesn't deprave a great deal, but\nfrom what I've seen of it I should say that it was intellectually\ndegrading.  Perhaps they might get some sort of lift from it; I don't\nknow.  Tom!\" he added, after a moment's reflection.  \"I really think I\nought to see this patron of yours.  Don't you think it would be rather\ndecent in me to make his acquaintance?\"\n\n\"Well, if you have the fancy, sir,\" said the young man.  \"But there's\nno sort of obligation.  Colonel Lapham would be the last man in the\nworld to want to give our relation any sort of social character.  The\nmeeting will come about in the natural course of things.\"\n\n\"Ah, I didn't intend to propose anything immediate,\" said the father.\n\"One can't do anything in the summer, and I should prefer your mother's\nsuperintendence.  Still, I can't rid myself of the idea of a dinner.\nIt appears to me that there ought to be a dinner.\"\n\n\"Oh, pray don't feel that there's any necessity.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the elder, with easy resignation, \"there's at least no\nhurry.\"\n\n\n\"There is one thing I don't like,\" said Lapham, in the course of one of\nthose talks which came up between his wife and himself concerning\nCorey, \"or at least I don't understand it; and that's the way his\nfather behaves.  I don't want to force myself on any man; but it seems\nto me pretty queer the way he holds off.  I should think he would take\nenough interest in his son to want to know something about his\nbusiness.  What is he afraid of?\" demanded Lapham angrily.  \"Does he\nthink I'm going to jump at a chance to get in with him, if he gives me\none? He's mightily mistaken if he does.  I don't want to know him.\"\n\n\"Silas,\" said his wife, making a wife's free version of her husband's\nwords, and replying to their spirit rather than their letter, \"I hope\nyou never said a word to Mr. Corey to let him know the way you feel.\"\n\n\"I never mentioned his father to him!\" roared the Colonel.  \"That's the\nway I feel about it!\"\n\n\"Because it would spoil everything.  I wouldn't have them think we\ncared the least thing in the world for their acquaintance.  We\nshouldn't be a bit better off.  We don't know the same people they do,\nand we don't care for the same kind of things.\"\n\nLapham was breathless with resentment of his wife's implication.\n\"Don't I tell you,\" he gasped, \"that I don't want to know them? Who\nbegan it? They're friends of yours if they're anybody's.\"\n\n\"They're distant acquaintances of mine,\" returned Mrs. Lapham quietly;\n\"and this young Corey is a clerk of yours.  And I want we should hold\nourselves so that when they get ready to make the advances we can meet\nthem half-way or not, just as we choose.\"\n\n\"That's what grinds me,\" cried her husband.  \"Why should we wait for\nthem to make the advances? Why shouldn't we make 'em? Are they any\nbetter than we are?  My note of hand would be worth ten times what\nBromfield Corey's is on the street to-day. And I made MY money.  I\nhaven't loafed my life away.\"\n\n\"Oh, it isn't what you've got, and it isn't what you've done exactly.\nIt's what you are.\"\n\n\"Well, then, what's the difference?\"\n\n\"None that really amounts to anything, or that need give you any\ntrouble, if you don't think of it.  But he's been all his life in\nsociety, and he knows just what to say and what to do, and he can talk\nabout the things that society people like to talk about, and\nyou--can't.\"\n\nLapham gave a furious snort.  \"And does that make him any better?\"\n\n\"No. But it puts him where he can make the advances without demeaning\nhimself, and it puts you where you can't. Now, look here, Silas Lapham!\nYou understand this thing as well as I do.  You know that I appreciate\nyou, and that I'd sooner die than have you humble yourself to a living\nsoul.  But I'm not going to have you coming to me, and pretending that\nyou can meet Bromfield Corey as an equal on his own ground.  You can't.\nHe's got a better education than you, and if he hasn't got more brains\nthan you, he's got different.  And he and his wife, and their fathers\nand grandfathers before 'em, have always had a high position, and you\ncan't help it.  If you want to know them, you've got to let them make\nthe advances.  If you don't, all well and good.\"\n\n\"I guess,\" said the chafed and vanquished Colonel, after a moment for\nswallowing the pill, \"that they'd have been in a pretty fix if you'd\nwaited to let them make the advances last summer.\"\n\n\"That was a different thing altogether.  I didn't know who they were,\nor may be I should have waited.  But all I say now is that if you've\ngot young Corey into business with you, in hopes of our getting into\nsociety with his father, you better ship him at once.  For I ain't\ngoing to have it on that basis.\"\n\n\"Who wants to have it on that basis?\" retorted her husband.\n\n\"Nobody, if you don't,\" said Mrs. Lapham tranquilly.\n\nIrene had come home with the shaving in her belt, unnoticed by her\nfather, and unquestioned by her mother.  But her sister saw it at once,\nand asked her what she was doing with it.\n\n\"Oh, nothing,\" said Irene, with a joyful smile of self-betrayal, taking\nthe shaving carefully out, and laying it among the laces and ribbons in\nher drawer.\n\n\"Hadn't you better put it in water, 'Rene? It'll be all wilted by\nmorning,\" said Pen.\n\n\"You mean thing!\" cried the happy girl.  \"It isn't a flower!\"\n\n\"Oh, I thought it was a whole bouquet.  Who gave it to you?\"\n\n\"I shan't tell you,\" said Irene saucily.\n\n\"Oh, well, never mind.  Did you know Mr. Corey had been down here this\nafternoon, walking on the beach with me?\"\n\n\"He wasn't--he wasn't at all! He was at the house with ME.  There! I've\ncaught you fairly.\"\n\n\"Is that so?\" drawled Penelope.  \"Then I never could guess who gave you\nthat precious shaving.\"\n\n\"No, you couldn't!\" said Irene, flushing beautifully.  \"And you may\nguess, and you may guess, and you may guess!\" With her lovely eyes she\ncoaxed her sister to keep on teasing her, and Penelope continued the\ncomedy with the patience that women have for such things.\n\n\"Well, I'm not going to try, if it's no use.  But I didn't know it had\ngot to be the fashion to give shavings instead of flowers.  But there's\nsome sense in it.  They can be used for kindlings when they get old,\nand you can't do anything with old flowers.  Perhaps he'll get to\nsending 'em by the barrel.\"\n\nIrene laughed for pleasure in this tormenting.  \"O Pen, I want to tell\nyou how it all happened.\"\n\n\"Oh, he DID give it to you, then? Well, I guess I don't care to hear.\"\n\n\"You shall, and you've got to!\" Irene ran and caught her sister, who\nfeigned to be going out of the room, and pushed her into a chair.\n\"There, now!\" She pulled up another chair, and hemmed her in with it.\n\"He came over, and sat down on the trestle alongside of me----\"\n\n\"What? As close as you are to me now?\"\n\n\"You wretch! I will GIVE it to you! No, at a proper distance.  And here\nwas this shaving on the floor, that I'd been poking with my parasol----\"\n\n\"To hide your embarrassment.\"\n\n\"Pshaw! I wasn't a bit embarrassed.  I was just as much at my ease! And\nthen he asked me to let him hold the shaving down with his foot, while\nI went on with my poking.  And I said yes he might----\"\n\n\"What a bold girl! You said he might hold a shaving down for you?\"\n\n\"And then--and then----\" continued Irene, lifting her eyes absently,\nand losing herself in the beatific recollection, \"and then----Oh yes!\nThen I asked him if he didn't like the smell of pine shavings.  And\nthen he picked it up, and said it smelt like a flower.  And then he\nasked if he might offer it to me--just for a joke, you know.  And I\ntook it, and stuck it in my belt.  And we had such a laugh! We got into\na regular gale.  And O Pen, what do you suppose he meant by it?\" She\nsuddenly caught herself to her sister's breast, and hid her burning\nface on her shoulder.\n\n\"Well, there used to be a book about the language of flowers.  But I\nnever knew much about the language of shavings, and I can't say\nexactly----\"\n\n\"Oh, don't--DON'T, Pen!\" and here Irene gave over laughing, and began\nto sob in her sister's arms.\n\n\"Why, 'Rene!\" cried the elder girl.\n\n\"You KNOW he didn't mean anything.  He doesn't care a bit about me.  He\nhates me! He despises me! Oh, what shall I do?\"\n\nA trouble passed over the face of the sister as she silently comforted\nthe child in her arms; then the drolling light came back into her eyes.\n\"Well, 'Rene, YOU haven't got to do ANYthing.  That's one advantage\ngirls have got--if it IS an advantage.  I'm not always sure.\"\n\nIrene's tears turned to laughing again.  When she lifted her head it\nwas to look into the mirror confronting them, where her beauty showed\nall the more brilliant for the shower that had passed over it.  She\nseemed to gather courage from the sight.\n\n\"It must be awful to have to DO,\" she said, smiling into her own face.\n\"I don't see how they ever can.\"\n\n\"Some of 'em can't--especially when there's such a tearing beauty\naround.\"\n\n\"Oh, pshaw, Pen! you know that isn't so.  You've got a real pretty\nmouth, Pen,\" she added thoughtfully, surveying the feature in the\nglass, and then pouting her own lips for the sake of that effect on\nthem.\n\n\"It's a useful mouth,\" Penelope admitted; \"I don't believe I could get\nalong without it now, I've had it so long.\"\n\n\"It's got such a funny expression--just the mate of the look in your\neyes; as if you were just going to say something ridiculous.  He said,\nthe very first time he saw you, that he knew you were humorous.\"\n\n\"Is it possible? It must be so, if the Grand Mogul said it.  Why didn't\nyou tell me so before, and not let me keep on going round just like a\ncommon person?\"\n\nIrene laughed as if she liked to have her sister take his praises in\nthat way rather than another.\n\n\"I've got such a stiff, prim kind of mouth,\" she said, drawing it down,\nand then looking anxiously at it.\n\n\"I hope you didn't put on that expression when he offered you the\nshaving.  If you did, I don't believe he'll ever give you another\nsplinter.\"\n\nThe severe mouth broke into a lovely laugh, and then pressed itself in\na kiss against Penelope's cheek.\n\n\"There! Be done, you silly thing! I'm not going to have you accepting\nME before I've offered myself, ANYWAY.\" She freed herself from her\nsister's embrace, and ran from her round the room.\n\nIrene pursued her, in the need of hiding her face against her shoulder\nagain.  \"O Pen! O Pen!\" she cried.\n\n\nThe next day, at the first moment of finding herself alone with her\neldest daughter, Mrs. Lapham asked, as if knowing that Penelope must\nhave already made it subject of inquiry: \"What was Irene doing with\nthat shaving in her belt yesterday?\"\n\n\"Oh, just some nonsense of hers with Mr. Corey.  He gave it to her at\nthe new house.\" Penelope did not choose to look up and meet her\nmother's grave glance.\n\n\"What do you think he meant by it?\"\n\nPenelope repeated Irene's account of the affair, and her mother\nlistened without seeming to derive much encouragement from it.\n\n\"He doesn't seem like one to flirt with her,\" she said at last.  Then,\nafter a thoughtful pause: \"Irene is as good a girl as ever breathed,\nand she's a perfect beauty.  But I should hate the day when a daughter\nof mine was married for her beauty.\"\n\n\"You're safe as far as I'm concerned, mother.\"\n\nMrs. Lapham smiled ruefully.  \"She isn't really equal to him, Pen.  I\nmisdoubted that from the first, and it's been borne in upon me more and\nmore ever since.  She hasn't mind enough.\" \"I didn't know that a man\nfell in love with a girl's intellect,\" said Penelope quietly.\n\n\"Oh no.  He hasn't fallen in love with Irene at all.  If he had, it\nwouldn't matter about the intellect.\"\n\nPenelope let the self-contradiction pass.\n\n\"Perhaps he has, after all.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Mrs. Lapham.  \"She pleases him when he sees her.  But he\ndoesn't try to see her.\"\n\n\"He has no chance.  You won't let father bring him here.\"\n\n\"He would find excuses to come without being brought, if he wished to\ncome,\" said the mother.  \"But she isn't in his mind enough to make him.\nHe goes away and doesn't think anything more about her.  She's a child.\nShe's a good child, and I shall always say it; but she's nothing but a\nchild.  No, she's got to forget him.\"\n\n\"Perhaps that won't be so easy.\"\n\n\"No, I presume not.  And now your father has got the notion in his\nhead, and he will move heaven and earth to bring it to pass.  I can see\nthat he's always thinking about it.\"\n\n\"The Colonel has a will of his own,\" observed the girl, rocking to and\nfro where she sat looking at her mother.\n\n\"I wish we had never met them!\" cried Mrs. Lapham.  \"I wish we had\nnever thought of building! I wish he had kept away from your father's\nbusiness!\"\n\n\"Well, it's too late now, mother,\" said the girl.  \"Perhaps it isn't so\nbad as you think.\"\n\n\"Well, we must stand it, anyway,\" said Mrs. Lapham, with the grim\nantique Yankee submission.\n\n\"Oh yes, we've got to stand it,\" said Penelope, with the quaint modern\nAmerican fatalism.\n\n\n\nX.\n\n\nIT was late June, almost July, when Corey took up his life in Boston\nagain, where the summer slips away so easily.  If you go out of town\nearly, it seems a very long summer when you come back in October; but\nif you stay, it passes swiftly, and, seen foreshortened in its flight,\nseems scarcely a month's length.  It has its days of heat, when it is\nvery hot, but for the most part it is cool, with baths of the east wind\nthat seem to saturate the soul with delicious freshness.  Then there\nare stretches of grey westerly weather, when the air is full of the\nsentiment of early autumn, and the frying, of the grasshopper in the\nblossomed weed of the vacant lots on the Back Bay is intershot with the\ncarol of crickets; and the yellowing leaf on the long slope of Mt.\nVernon Street smites the sauntering observer with tender melancholy.\nThe caterpillar, gorged with the spoil of the lindens on Chestnut, and\nweaving his own shroud about him in his lodgment on the brick-work,\nrecords the passing of summer by mid-July; and if after that comes\nAugust, its breath is thick and short, and September is upon the\nsojourner before he has fairly had time to philosophise the character\nof the town out of season.\n\nBut it must have appeared that its most characteristic feature was the\nabsence of everybody he knew.  This was one of the things that\ncommended Boston to Bromfield Corey during the summer; and if his son\nhad any qualms about the life he had entered upon with such vigour, it\nmust have been a relief to him that there was scarcely a soul left to\nwonder or pity.  By the time people got back to town the fact of his\nconnection with the mineral paint man would be an old story, heard afar\noff with different degrees of surprise, and considered with different\ndegrees of indifference.  A man has not reached the age of twenty-six\nin any community where he was born and reared without having had his\ncapacity pretty well ascertained; and in Boston the analysis is\nconducted with an unsparing thoroughness which may fitly impress the\nun-Bostonian mind, darkened by the popular superstition that the\nBostonians blindly admire one another.  A man's qualities are sifted as\nclosely in Boston as they doubtless were in Florence or Athens; and, if\nfinal mercy was shown in those cities because a man was, with all his\nlimitations, an Athenian or Florentine, some abatement might as justly\nbe made in Boston for like reason.  Corey's powers had been gauged in\ncollege, and he had not given his world reason to think very\ndifferently of him since he came out of college.  He was rated as an\nenergetic fellow, a little indefinite in aim, with the smallest amount\nof inspiration that can save a man from being commonplace.  If he was\nnot commonplace, it was through nothing remarkable in his mind, which\nwas simply clear and practical, but through some combination of\nqualities of the heart that made men trust him, and women call him\nsweet--a word of theirs which conveys otherwise indefinable\nexcellences.  Some of the more nervous and excitable said that Tom\nCorey was as sweet as he could live; but this perhaps meant no more\nthan the word alone.  No man ever had a son less like him than\nBromfield Corey.  If Tom Corey had ever said a witty thing, no one\ncould remember it; and yet the father had never said a witty thing to a\nmore sympathetic listener than his own son.  The clear mind which\nproduced nothing but practical results reflected everything with\ncharming lucidity; and it must have been this which endeared Tom Corey\nto every one who spoke ten words with him.  In a city where people have\ngood reason for liking to shine, a man who did not care to shine must\nbe little short of universally acceptable without any other effort for\npopularity; and those who admired and enjoyed Bromfield Corey loved his\nson.  Yet, when it came to accounting for Tom Corey, as it often did in\na community where every one's generation is known to the remotest\ndegrees of cousinship, they could not trace his sweetness to his\nmother, for neither Anna Bellingham nor any of her family, though they\nwere so many blocks of Wenham ice for purity and rectangularity, had\never had any such savour; and, in fact, it was to his father, whose\nhabit of talk wronged it in himself, that they had to turn for this\nquality of the son's. They traced to the mother the traits of\npracticality and common-sense in which he bordered upon the\ncommonplace, and which, when they had dwelt upon them, made him seem\nhardly worth the close inquiry they had given him.\n\nWhile the summer wore away he came and went methodically about his\nbusiness, as if it had been the business of his life, sharing his\nfather's bachelor liberty and solitude, and expecting with equal\npatience the return of his mother and sisters in the autumn.  Once or\ntwice he found time to run down to Mt.  Desert and see them; and then\nhe heard how the Philadelphia and New York people were getting in\neverywhere, and was given reason to regret the house at Nahant which he\nhad urged to be sold.  He came back and applied himself to his desk\nwith a devotion that was exemplary rather than necessary; for Lapham\nmade no difficulty about the brief absences which he asked, and set no\nterm to the apprenticeship that Corey was serving in the office before\nsetting off upon that mission to South America in the early winter, for\nwhich no date had yet been fixed.\n\nThe summer was a dull season for the paint as well as for everything\nelse.  Till things should brisk up, as Lapham said, in the fall, he was\nletting the new house take a great deal of his time.  AEsthetic ideas\nhad never been intelligibly presented to him before, and he found a\ndelight in apprehending them that was very grateful to his imaginative\narchitect.  At the beginning, the architect had foreboded a series of\nmortifying defeats and disastrous victories in his encounters with his\nclient; but he had never had a client who could be more reasonably led\non from one outlay to another.  It appeared that Lapham required but to\nunderstand or feel the beautiful effect intended, and he was ready to\npay for it.  His bull-headed pride was concerned in a thing which the\narchitect made him see, and then he believed that he had seen it\nhimself, perhaps conceived it.  In some measure the architect seemed to\nshare his delusion, and freely said that Lapham was very suggestive.\nTogether they blocked out windows here, and bricked them up there; they\nchanged doors and passages; pulled down cornices and replaced them with\nothers of different design; experimented with costly devices of\ndecoration, and went to extravagant lengths in novelties of finish.\nMrs. Lapham, beginning with a woman's adventurousness in the unknown\nregion, took fright at the reckless outlay at last, and refused to let\nher husband pass a certain limit.  He tried to make her believe that a\nfar-seeing economy dictated the expense; and that if he put the money\ninto the house, he could get it out any time by selling it.  She would\nnot be persuaded.\n\n\"I don't want you should sell it.  And you've put more money into it\nnow than you'll ever get out again, unless you can find as big a goose\nto buy it, and that isn't likely.  No, sir! You just stop at a hundred\nthousand, and don't you let him get you a cent beyond.  Why, you're\nperfectly bewitched with that fellow! You've lost your head, Silas\nLapham, and if you don't look out you'll lose your money too.\"\n\nThe Colonel laughed; he liked her to talk that way, and promised he\nwould hold up a while.\n\n\"But there's no call to feel anxious, Pert.  It's only a question what\nto do with the money.  I can reinvest it; but I never had so much of it\nto spend before.\"\n\n\"Spend it, then,\" said his wife; \"don't throw it away!  And how came\nyou to have so much more money than you know what to do with, Silas\nLapham?\" she added.\n\n\"Oh, I've made a very good thing in stocks lately.\"\n\n\"In stocks? When did you take up gambling for a living?\"\n\n\"Gambling? Stuff! What gambling? Who said it was gambling?\"\n\n\"You have; many a time.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, buying and selling on a margin.  But this was a bona fide\ntransaction.  I bought at forty-three for an investment, and I sold at\na hundred and seven; and the money passed both times.\"\n\n\"Well, you better let stocks alone,\" said his wife, with the\nconservatism of her sex.  \"Next time you'll buy at a hundred and seven\nand sell at forty three.  Then where'll you be?\"\n\n\"Left,\" admitted the Colonel.\n\n\"You better stick to paint a while yet.\" The Colonel enjoyed this too,\nand laughed again with the ease of a man who knows what he is about.  A\nfew days after that he came down to Nantasket with the radiant air\nwhich he wore when he had done a good thing in business and wanted his\nwife's sympathy.  He did not say anything of what had happened till he\nwas alone with her in their own room; but he was very gay the whole\nevening, and made several jokes which Penelope said nothing but very\ngreat prosperity could excuse: they all understood these moods of his.\n\n\"Well, what is it, Silas?\" asked his wife when the time came.  \"Any\nmore big-bugs wanting to go into the mineral paint business with you?\"\n\n\"Something better than that.\"\n\n\"I could think of a good many better things,\" said his wife, with a\nsigh of latent bitterness.  \"What's this one?\"\n\n\"I've had a visitor.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Can't you guess?\"\n\n\"I don't want to try.  Who was it?\"\n\n\"Rogers.\"\n\nMrs. Lapham sat down with her hands in her lap, and stared at the smile\non her husband's face, where he sat facing her.\n\n\"I guess you wouldn't want to joke on that subject, Si,\" she said, a\nlittle hoarsely, \"and you wouldn't grin about it unless you had some\ngood news.  I don't know what the miracle is, but if you could tell\nquick----\"\n\nShe stopped like one who can say no more.\n\n\"I will, Persis,\" said her husband, and with that awed tone in which he\nrarely spoke of anything but the virtues of his paint.  \"He came to\nborrow money of me, and I lent him it.  That's the short of it.  The\nlong----\"\n\n\"Go on,\" said his wife, with gentle patience.\n\n\"Well, Pert, I was never so much astonished in my life as I was to see\nthat man come into my office.  You might have knocked me down with--I\ndon't know what.\"\n\n\"I don't wonder.  Go on!\"\n\n\"And he was as much embarrassed as I was.  There we stood, gaping at\neach other, and I hadn't hardly sense enough to ask him to take a\nchair.  I don't know just how we got at it.  And I don't remember just\nhow it was that he said he came to come to me.  But he had got hold of\na patent right that he wanted to go into on a large scale, and there he\nwas wanting me to supply him the funds.\"\n\n\"Go on!\" said Mrs. Lapham, with her voice further in her throat.\n\n\"I never felt the way you did about Rogers, but I know how you always\ndid feel, and I guess I surprised him with my answer.  He had brought\nalong a lot of stock as security----\"\n\n\"You didn't take it, Silas!\" his wife flashed out.\n\n\"Yes, I did, though,\" said Lapham.  \"You wait.  We settled our\nbusiness, and then we went into the old thing, from the very start.\nAnd we talked it all over.  And when we got through we shook hands.\nWell, I don't know when it's done me so much good to shake hands with\nanybody.\"\n\n\"And you told him--you owned up to him that you were in the wrong,\nSilas?\"\n\n\"No, I didn't,\" returned the Colonel promptly; \"for I wasn't. And\nbefore we got through, I guess he saw it the same as I did.\"\n\n\"Oh, no matter! so you had the chance to show how you felt.\"\n\n\"But I never felt that way,\" persisted the Colonel.  \"I've lent him the\nmoney, and I've kept his stocks.  And he got what he wanted out of me.\"\n\n\"Give him back his stocks!\"\n\n\"No, I shan't. Rogers came to borrow.  He didn't come to beg.  You\nneedn't be troubled about his stocks.  They're going to come up in\ntime; but just now they're so low down that no bank would take them as\nsecurity, and I've got to hold them till they do rise.  I hope you're\nsatisfied now, Persis,\" said her husband; and he looked at her with the\nwillingness to receive the reward of a good action which we all feel\nwhen we have performed one.  \"I lent him the money you kept me from\nspending on the house.\"\n\n\"Truly, Si? Well, I'm satisfied,\" said Mrs. Lapham, with a deep\ntremulous breath.  \"The Lord has been good to you, Silas,\" she\ncontinued solemnly.  \"You may laugh if you choose, and I don't know as\nI believe in his interfering a great deal; but I believe he's\ninterfered this time; and I tell you, Silas, it ain't always he gives\npeople a chance to make it up to others in this life.  I've been afraid\nyou'd die, Silas, before you got the chance; but he's let you live to\nmake it up to Rogers.\"\n\n\"I'm glad to be let live,\" said Lapham stubbornly, \"but I hadn't\nanything to make up to Milton K. Rogers.  And if God has let me live\nfor that----\"\n\n\"Oh, say what you please, Si! Say what you please, now you've done it!\nI shan't stop you.  You've taken the one spot--the one SPECK--off you\nthat was ever there, and I'm satisfied.\"\n\n\"There wa'n't ever any speck there,\" Lapham held out, lapsing more and\nmore into his vernacular; \"and what I done I done for you, Persis.\"\n\n\"And I thank you for your own soul's sake, Silas.\"\n\n\"I guess my soul's all right,\" said Lapham.\n\n\"And I want you should promise me one thing more.\"\n\n\"Thought you said you were satisfied?\"\n\n\"I am.  But I want you should promise me this: that you won't let\nanything tempt you--anything!--to ever trouble Rogers for that money\nyou lent him.  No matter what happens--no matter if you lose it all.\nDo you promise?\"\n\n\"Why, I don't ever EXPECT to press him for it.  That's what I said to\nmyself when I lent it.  And of course I'm glad to have that old trouble\nhealed up.  I don't THINK I ever did Rogers any wrong, and I never did\nthink so; but if I DID do it--IF I did--I'm willing to call it square,\nif I never see a cent of my money back again.\"\n\n\"Well, that's all,\" said his wife.\n\nThey did not celebrate his reconciliation with his old enemy--for such\nthey had always felt him to be since he ceased to be an ally--by any\nshow of joy or affection.  It was not in their tradition, as stoical\nfor the woman as for the man, that they should kiss or embrace each\nother at such a moment.  She was content to have told him that he had\ndone his duty, and he was content with her saying that.  But before she\nslept she found words to add that she always feared the selfish part he\nhad acted toward Rogers had weakened him, and left him less able to\novercome any temptation that might beset him; and that was one reason\nwhy she could never be easy about it.  Now she should never fear for\nhim again.\n\nThis time he did not explicitly deny her forgiving impeachment.  \"Well,\nit's all past and gone now, anyway; and I don't want you should think\nanything more about it.\"\n\nHe was man enough to take advantage of the high favour in which he\nstood when he went up to town, and to abuse it by bringing Corey down\nto supper.  His wife could not help condoning the sin of disobedience\nin him at such a time.  Penelope said that between the admiration she\nfelt for the Colonel's boldness and her mother's forbearance, she was\nhardly in a state to entertain company that evening; but she did what\nshe could.\n\nIrene liked being talked to better than talking, and when her sister\nwas by she was always, tacitly or explicitly, referring to her for\nconfirmation of what she said.  She was content to sit and look pretty\nas she looked at the young man and listened to her sister's drolling.\nShe laughed and kept glancing at Corey to make sure that he was\nunderstanding her.  When they went out on the veranda to see the moon\non the water, Penelope led the way and Irene followed.\n\nThey did not look at the moonlight long.  The young man perched on the\nrail of the veranda, and Irene took one of the red-painted\nrocking-chairs where she could conveniently look at him and at her\nsister, who sat leaning forward lazily and running on, as the phrase\nis.  That low, crooning note of hers was delicious; her face, glimpsed\nnow and then in the moonlight as she turned it or lifted it a little,\nhad a fascination which kept his eye.  Her talk was very unliterary,\nand its effect seemed hardly conscious.  She was far from epigram in\nher funning.  She told of this trifle and that; she sketched the\ncharacters and looks of people who had interested her, and nothing\nseemed to have escaped her notice; she mimicked a little, but not much;\nshe suggested, and then the affair represented itself as if without her\nagency.  She did not laugh; when Corey stopped she made a soft cluck in\nher throat, as if she liked his being amused, and went on again.\n\nThe Colonel, left alone with his wife for the first time since he had\ncome from town, made haste to take the word.  \"Well, Pert, I've\narranged the whole thing with Rogers, and I hope you'll be satisfied to\nknow that he owes me twenty thousand dollars, and that I've got\nsecurity from him to the amount of a fourth of that, if I was to force\nhis stocks to a sale.\"\n\n\"How came he to come down with you?\" asked Mrs. Lapham.\n\n\"Who? Rogers?\"\n\n\"Mr. Corey.\"\n\n\"Corey? Oh!\" said Lapham, affecting not to have thought she could mean\nCorey.  \"He proposed it.\"\n\n\"Likely!\" jeered his wife, but with perfect amiability.\n\n\"It's so,\" protested the Colonel.  \"We got talking about a matter just\nbefore I left, and he walked down to the boat with me; and then he said\nif I didn't mind he guessed he'd come along down and go back on the\nreturn boat.  Of course I couldn't let him do that.\"\n\n\"It's well for you you couldn't.\"\n\n\"And I couldn't do less than bring him here to tea.\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly not.\"\n\n\"But he ain't going to stay the night--unless,\" faltered Lapham, \"you\nwant him to.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course, I want him to! I guess he'll stay, probably.\"\n\n\"Well, you know how crowded that last boat always is, and he can't get\nany other now.\"\n\nMrs. Lapham laughed at the simple wile.  \"I hope you'll be just as well\nsatisfied, Si, if it turns out he doesn't want Irene after all.\"\n\n\"Pshaw, Persis! What are you always bringing that up for?\" pleaded the\nColonel.  Then he fell silent, and presently his rude, strong face was\nclouded with an unconscious frown.\n\n\"There!\" cried his wife, startling him from his abstraction.  \"I see\nhow you'd feel; and I hope that you'll remember who you've got to\nblame.\"\n\n\"I'll risk it,\" said Lapham, with the confidence of a man used to\nsuccess.\n\nFrom the veranda the sound of Penelope's lazy tone came through the\nclosed windows, with joyous laughter from Irene and peals from Corey.\n\n\"Listen to that!\" said her father within, swelling up with\ninexpressible satisfaction.  \"That girl can talk for twenty, right\nstraight along.  She's better than a circus any day.  I wonder what\nshe's up to now.\"\n\n\"Oh, she's probably getting off some of those yarns of hers, or telling\nabout some people.  She can't step out of the house without coming back\nwith more things to talk about than most folks would bring back from\nJapan.  There ain't a ridiculous person she's ever seen but what she's\ngot something from them to make you laugh at; and I don't believe we've\never had anybody in the house since the girl could talk that she hain't\ngot some saying from, or some trick that'll paint 'em out so't you can\nsee 'em and hear 'em. Sometimes I want to stop her; but when she gets\ninto one of her gales there ain't any standing up against her.  I guess\nit's lucky for Irene that she's got Pen there to help entertain her\ncompany.  I can't ever feel down where Pen is.\"\n\n\"That's so,\" said the Colonel.  \"And I guess she's got about as much\nculture as any of them.  Don't you?\"\n\n\"She reads a great deal,\" admitted her mother.  \"She seems to be at it\nthe whole while.  I don't want she should injure her health, and\nsometimes I feel like snatchin' the books away from her.  I don't know\nas it's good for a girl to read so much, anyway, especially novels.  I\ndon't want she should get notions.\"\n\n\"Oh, I guess Pen'll know how to take care of herself,\" said Lapham.\n\n\"She's got sense enough.  But she ain't so practical as Irene.  She's\nmore up in the clouds--more of what you may call a dreamer.  Irene's\nwide-awake every minute; and I declare, any one to see these two\ntogether when there's anything to be done, or any lead to be taken,\nwould say Irene was the oldest, nine times out of ten.  It's only when\nthey get to talking that you can see Pen's got twice as much brains.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Lapham, tacitly granting this point, and leaning back in\nhis chair in supreme content.  \"Did you ever see much nicer girls\nanywhere?\"\n\nHis wife laughed at his pride.  \"I presume they're as much swans as\nanybody's geese.\"\n\n\"No; but honestly, now!\"\n\n\"Oh, they'll do; but don't you be silly, if you can help it, Si.\"\n\nThe young people came in, and Corey said it was time for his boat.\nMrs. Lapham pressed him to stay, but he persisted, and he would not let\nthe Colonel send him to the boat; he said he would rather walk.\nOutside, he pushed along toward the boat, which presently he could see\nlying at her landing in the bay, across the sandy tract to the left of\nthe hotels.  From time to time he almost stopped in his rapid walk, as\na man does whose mind is in a pleasant tumult; and then he went forward\nat a swifter pace.  \"She's charming!\" he said, and he thought he had\nspoken aloud.  He found himself floundering about in the deep sand,\nwide of the path; he got back to it, and reached the boat just before\nshe started.  The clerk came to take his fare, and Corey looked\nradiantly up at him in his lantern-light, with a smile that he must\nhave been wearing a long time; his cheek was stiff with it.  Once some\npeople who stood near him edged suddenly and fearfully away, and then\nhe suspected himself of having laughed outright.\n\n\n\nXI.\n\n\nCOREY put off his set smile with the help of a frown, of which he first\nbecame aware after reaching home, when his father asked--\n\n\"Anything gone wrong with your department of the fine arts to-day, Tom?\"\n\n\"Oh no--no, sir,\" said the son, instantly relieving his brows from the\nstrain upon them, and beaming again.  \"But I was thinking whether you\nwere not perhaps right in your impression that it might be well for you\nto make Colonel Lapham's acquaintance before a great while.\"\n\n\"Has he been suggesting it in any way?\" asked Bromfield Corey, laying\naside his book and taking his lean knee between his clasped hands.\n\n\"Oh, not at all!\" the young man hastened to reply.  \"I was merely\nthinking whether it might not begin to seem intentional, your not doing\nit.\"\n\n\"Well, Tom, you know I have been leaving it altogether to you----\"\n\n\"Oh, I understand, of course, and I didn't mean to urge anything of the\nkind----\"\n\n\"You are so very much more of a Bostonian than I am, you know, that\nI've been waiting your motion in entire confidence that you would know\njust what to do, and when to do it.  If I had been left quite to my own\nlawless impulses, I think I should have called upon your padrone at\nonce.  It seems to me that my father would have found some way of\nshowing that he expected as much as that from people placed in the\nrelation to him that we hold to Colonel Lapham.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\" asked the young man.\n\n\"Yes. But you know I don't pretend to be an authority in such matters.\nAs far as they go, I am always in the hands of your mother and you\nchildren.\"\n\n\"I'm very sorry, sir.  I had no idea I was over-ruling your judgment.\nI only wanted to spare you a formality that didn't seem quite a\nnecessity yet.  I'm very sorry,\" he said again, and this time with more\ncomprehensive regret.  \"I shouldn't like to have seemed remiss with a\nman who has been so considerate of me.  They are all very good-natured.\"\n\n\"I dare say,\" said Bromfield Corey, with the satisfaction which no\nelder can help feeling in disabling the judgment of a younger man,\n\"that it won't be too late if I go down to your office with you\nto-morrow.\"\n\n\"No, no.  I didn't imagine your doing it at once, sir.\"\n\n\"Ah, but nothing can prevent me from doing a thing when once I take the\nbit in my teeth,\" said the father, with the pleasure which men of weak\nwill sometimes take in recognising their weakness.  \"How does their new\nhouse get on?\"\n\n\"I believe they expect to be in it before New Year.\"\n\n\"Will they be a great addition to society?\" asked Bromfield Corey, with\nunimpeachable seriousness.\n\n\"I don't quite know what you mean,\" returned the son, a little uneasily.\n\n\"Ah, I see that you do, Tom.\"\n\n\"No one can help feeling that they are all people of good sense\nand--right ideas.\"\n\n\"Oh, that won't do.  If society took in all the people of right ideas\nand good sense, it would expand beyond the calling capacity of its most\nactive members.  Even your mother's social conscientiousness could not\ncompass it.  Society is a very different sort of thing from good sense\nand right ideas.  It is based upon them, of course, but the airy,\ngraceful, winning superstructure which we all know demands different\nqualities.  Have your friends got these qualities,--which may be felt,\nbut not defined?\"\n\nThe son laughed.  \"To tell you the truth, sir, I don't think they have\nthe most elemental ideas of society, as we understand it.  I don't\nbelieve Mrs. Lapham ever gave a dinner.\"\n\n\"And with all that money!\" sighed the father.\n\n\"I don't believe they have the habit of wine at table.  I suspect that\nwhen they don't drink tea and coffee with their dinner, they drink\nice-water.\"\n\n\"Horrible!\" said Bromfield Corey.\n\n\"It appears to me that this defines them.\"\n\n\"Oh yes.  There are people who give dinners, and who are not\ncognoscible.  But people who have never yet given a dinner, how is\nsociety to assimilate them?\"\n\n\"It digests a great many people,\" suggested the young man.\n\n\"Yes; but they have always brought some sort of sauce piquante with\nthem.  Now, as I understand you, these friends of yours have no such\nsauce.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know about that!\" cried the son.\n\n\"Oh, rude, native flavours, I dare say.  But that isn't what I mean.\nWell, then, they must spend.  There is no other way for them to win\ntheir way to general regard.  We must have the Colonel elected to the\nTen O'clock Club, and he must put himself down in the list of those\nwilling to entertain.  Any one can manage a large supper.  Yes, I see a\ngleam of hope for him in that direction.\"\n\nIn the morning Bromfield Corey asked his son whether he should find\nLapham at his place as early as eleven.\n\n\"I think you might find him even earlier.  I've never been there before\nhim.  I doubt if the porter is there much sooner.\"\n\n\"Well, suppose I go with you, then?\"\n\n\"Why, if you like, sir,\" said the son, with some deprecation.\n\n\"Oh, the question is, will HE like?\"\n\n\"I think he will, sir;\" and the father could see that his son was very\nmuch pleased.\n\nLapham was rending an impatient course through the morning's news when\nthey appeared at the door of his inner room.  He looked up from the\nnewspaper spread on the desk before him, and then he stood up, making\nan indifferent feint of not knowing that he knew Bromfield Corey by\nsight.\n\n\"Good morning, Colonel Lapham,\" said the son, and Lapham waited for him\nto say further, \"I wish to introduce my father.\" Then he answered,\n\"Good morning,\" and added rather sternly for the elder Corey, \"How do\nyou do, sir? Will you take a chair?\" and he pushed him one.\n\nThey shook hands and sat down, and Lapham said to his subordinate,\n\"Have a seat;\" but young Corey remained standing, watching them in\ntheir observance of each other with an amusement which was a little\nuneasy.  Lapham made his visitor speak first by waiting for him to do\nso.\n\n\"I'm glad to make your acquaintance, Colonel Lapham, and I ought to\nhave come sooner to do so.  My father in your place would have expected\nit of a man in my place at once, I believe.  But I can't feel myself\naltogether a stranger as it is.  I hope Mrs. Lapham is well? And your\ndaughter?\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Lapham, \"they're quite well.\"\n\n\"They were very kind to my wife----\"\n\n\"Oh, that was nothing!\" cried Lapham.  \"There's nothing Mrs. Lapham\nlikes better than a chance of that sort.  Mrs. Corey and the young\nladies well?\"\n\n\"Very well, when I heard from them.  They're out of town.\"\n\n\"Yes, so I understood,\" said Lapham, with a nod toward the son.  \"I\nbelieve Mr. Corey, here, told Mrs. Lapham.\" He leaned back in his\nchair, stiffly resolute to show that he was not incommoded by the\nexchange of these civilities.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Bromfield Corey.  \"Tom has had the pleasure which I hope\nfor of seeing you all.  I hope you're able to make him useful to you\nhere?\" Corey looked round Lapham's room vaguely, and then out at the\nclerks in their railed enclosure, where his eye finally rested on an\nextremely pretty girl, who was operating a type-writer.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" replied Lapham, softening for the first time with this\napproach to business, \"I guess it will be our own fault if we don't. By\nthe way, Corey,\" he added, to the younger man, as he gathered up some\nletters from his desk, \"here's something in your line.  Spanish or\nFrench, I guess.\"\n\n\"I'll run them over,\" said Corey, taking them to his desk.\n\nHis father made an offer to rise.\n\n\"Don't go,\" said Lapham, gesturing him down again.  \"I just wanted to\nget him away a minute.  I don't care to say it to his face,--I don't\nlike the principle,--but since you ask me about it, I'd just as lief\nsay that I've never had any young man take hold here equal to your son.\nI don't know as you care.\"\n\n\"You make me very happy,\" said Bromfield Corey.  \"Very happy indeed.\nI've always had the idea that there was something in my son, if he\ncould only find the way to work it out.  And he seems to have gone into\nyour business for the love of it.\"\n\n\"He went to work in the right way, sir! He told me about it.  He looked\ninto it.  And that paint is a thing that will bear looking into.\"\n\n\"Oh yes.  You might think he had invented it, if you heard him\ncelebrating it.\"\n\n\"Is that so?\" demanded Lapham, pleased through and through.  \"Well,\nthere ain't any other way.  You've got to believe in a thing before you\ncan put any heart in it.  Why, I had a partner in this thing once,\nalong back just after the war, and he used to be always wanting to\ntinker with something else.  'Why,' says I, 'you've got the best thing\nin God's universe now.  Why ain't you satisfied?' I had to get rid of\nhim at last.  I stuck to my paint, and that fellow's drifted round\npretty much all over the whole country, whittling his capital down all\nthe while, till here the other day I had to lend him some money to\nstart him new.  No, sir, you've got to believe in a thing.  And I\nbelieve in your son.  And I don't mind telling you that, so far as he's\ngone, he's a success.\"\n\n\"That's very kind of you.\"\n\n\"No kindness about it.  As I was saying the other day to a friend of\nmine, I've had many a fellow right out of the street that had to work\nhard all his life, and didn't begin to take hold like this son of\nyours.\"\n\nLapham expanded with profound self-satisfaction. As he probably\nconceived it, he had succeeded in praising, in a perfectly casual way,\nthe supreme excellence of his paint, and his own sagacity and\nbenevolence; and here he was sitting face to face with Bromfield Corey,\npraising his son to him, and receiving his grateful acknowledgments as\nif he were the father of some office-boy whom Lapham had given a place\nhalf but of charity.\n\n\"Yes, sir, when your son proposed to take hold here, I didn't have much\nfaith in his ideas, that's the truth.  But I had faith in him, and I\nsaw that he meant business from the start.  I could see it was born in\nhim.  Any one could.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid he didn't inherit it directly from me,\" said Bromfield\nCorey; \"but it's in the blood, on both sides.\" \"Well, sir, we can't\nhelp those things,\" said Lapham compassionately.  \"Some of us have got\nit, and some of us haven't. The idea is to make the most of what we\nHAVE got.\"\n\n\"Oh yes; that is the idea.  By all means.\"\n\n\"And you can't ever tell what's in you till you try.  Why, when I\nstarted this thing, I didn't more than half understand my own strength.\nI wouldn't have said, looking back, that I could have stood the wear\nand tear of what I've been through.  But I developed as I went along.\nIt's just like exercising your muscles in a gymnasium.  You can lift\ntwice or three times as much after you've been in training a month as\nyou could before.  And I can see that it's going to be just so with\nyour son.  His going through college won't hurt him,--he'll soon slough\nall that off,--and his bringing up won't; don't be anxious about it.  I\nnoticed in the army that some of the fellows that had the most go-ahead\nwere fellows that hadn't ever had much more to do than girls before the\nwar broke out.  Your son will get along.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Bromfield Corey, and smiled--whether because his\nspirit was safe in the humility he sometimes boasted, or because it was\ntriply armed in pride against anything the Colonel's kindness could do.\n\n\"He'll get along.  He's a good business man, and he's a fine fellow.\nMUST you go?\" asked Lapham, as Bromfield Corey now rose more\nresolutely.  \"Well, glad to see you.  It was natural you should want to\ncome and see what he was about, and I'm glad you did.  I should have\nfelt just so about it.  Here is some of our stuff,\" he said, pointing\nout the various packages in his office, including the Persis Brand.\n\n\"Ah, that's very nice, very nice indeed,\" said his visitor.  \"That\ncolour through the jar--very rich--delicious.  Is Persis Brand a name?\"\n\nLapham blushed.\n\n\"Well, Persis is.  I don't know as you saw an interview that fellow\npublished in the Events a while back?\"\n\n\"What is the Events?\"\n\n\"Well, it's that new paper Witherby's started.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Bromfield Corey, \"I haven't seen it.  I read The Daily,\" he\nexplained; by which he meant The Daily Advertiser, the only daily there\nis in the old-fashioned Bostonian sense.\n\n\"He put a lot of stuff in my mouth that I never said,\" resumed Lapham;\n\"but that's neither here nor there, so long as you haven't seen it.\nHere's the department your son's in,\" and he showed him the foreign\nlabels.  Then he took him out into the warehouse to see the large\npackages.  At the head of the stairs, where his guest stopped to nod to\nhis son and say \"Good-bye, Tom,\" Lapham insisted upon going down to the\nlower door with him \"Well, call again,\" he said in hospitable\ndismissal.  \"I shall always be glad to see you.  There ain't a great\ndeal doing at this season.\" Bromfield Corey thanked him, and let his\nhand remain perforce in Lapham's lingering grasp.  \"If you ever like to\nride after a good horse----\" the Colonel began.\n\n\"Oh, no, no, no; thank you! The better the horse, the more I should be\nscared.  Tom has told me of your driving!\"\n\n\"Ha, ha, ha!\" laughed the Colonel.  \"Well! every one to his taste.\nWell, good morning, sir!\" and he suffered him to go.\n\n\"Who is the old man blowing to this morning?\" asked Walker, the\nbook-keeper, making an errand to Corey's desk.\n\n\"My father.\"\n\n\"Oh! That your father? I thought he must be one of your Italian\ncorrespondents that you'd been showing round, or Spanish.\"\n\nIn fact, as Bromfield Corey found his way at his leisurely pace up\nthrough the streets on which the prosperity of his native city was\nfounded, hardly any figure could have looked more alien to its life.\nHe glanced up and down the facades and through the crooked vistas like\na stranger, and the swarthy fruiterer of whom he bought an apple,\napparently for the pleasure of holding it in his hand, was not\nsurprised that the purchase should be transacted in his own tongue.\n\nLapham walked back through the outer office to his own room without\nlooking at Corey, and during the day he spoke to him only of business\nmatters.  That must have been his way of letting Corey see that he was\nnot overcome by the honour of his father's visit.  But he presented\nhimself at Nantasket with the event so perceptibly on his mind that his\nwife asked: \"Well, Silas, has Rogers been borrowing any more money of\nyou? I don't want you should let that thing go too far.  You've done\nenough.\"\n\n\"You needn't be afraid.  I've seen the last of Rogers for one while.\"\nHe hesitated, to give the fact an effect of no importance.  \"Corey's\nfather called this morning.\"\n\n\"Did he?\" said Mrs. Lapham, willing to humour his feint of\nindifference.  \"Did HE want to borrow some money too?\" \"Not as I\nunderstood.\" Lapham was smoking at great ease, and his wife had some\ncrocheting on the other side of the lamp from him.\n\nThe girls were on the piazza looking at the moon on the water again.\n\"There's no man in it to-night,\" Penelope said, and Irene laughed\nforlornly.\n\n\"What DID he want, then?\" asked Mrs. Lapham.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know.  Seemed to be just a friendly call.  Said he ought\nto have come before.\"\n\nMrs. Lapham was silent a while.  Then she said: \"Well, I hope you're\nsatisfied now.\"\n\nLapham rejected the sympathy too openly offered.  \"I don't know about\nbeing satisfied.  I wa'n't in any hurry to see him.\"\n\nHis wife permitted him this pretence also.  \"What sort of a person is\nhe, anyway?\"\n\n\"Well, not much like his son.  There's no sort of business about him.\nI don't know just how you'd describe him.  He's tall; and he's got\nwhite hair and a moustache; and his fingers are very long and limber.\nI couldn't help noticing them as he sat there with his hands on the top\nof his cane.  Didn't seem to be dressed very much, and acted just like\nanybody.  Didn't talk much.  Guess I did most of the talking.  Said he\nwas glad I seemed to be getting along so well with his son.  He asked\nafter you and Irene; and he said he couldn't feel just like a stranger.\nSaid you had been very kind to his wife.  Of course I turned it off.\nYes,\" said Lapham thoughtfully, with his hands resting on his knees,\nand his cigar between the fingers of his left hand, \"I guess he meant\nto do the right thing, every way.  Don't know as I ever saw a much\npleasanter man.  Dunno but what he's about the pleasantest man I ever\ndid see.\" He was not letting his wife see in his averted face the\nstruggle that revealed itself there--the struggle of stalwart\nachievement not to feel flattered at the notice of sterile elegance,\nnot to be sneakingly glad of its amiability, but to stand up and look\nat it with eyes on the same level.  God, who made us so much like\nhimself, but out of the dust, alone knows when that struggle will end.\nThe time had been when Lapham could not have imagined any worldly\nsplendour which his dollars could not buy if he chose to spend them for\nit; but his wife's half discoveries, taking form again in his ignorance\nof the world, filled him with helpless misgiving.  A cloudy vision of\nsomething unpurchasable, where he had supposed there was nothing, had\ncowed him in spite of the burly resistance of his pride.\n\n\"I don't see why he shouldn't be pleasant,\" said Mrs. Lapham.  \"He's\nnever done anything else.\"\n\nLapham looked up consciously, with an uneasy laugh.  \"Pshaw, Persis!\nyou never forget anything?\"\n\n\"Oh, I've got more than that to remember.  I suppose you asked him to\nride after the mare?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Lapham, reddening guiltily, \"he said he was afraid of a\ngood horse.\"\n\n\"Then, of course, you hadn't asked him.\" Mrs. Lapham crocheted in\nsilence, and her husband leaned back in his chair and smoked.\n\nAt last he said, \"I'm going to push that house forward.  They're\nloafing on it.  There's no reason why we shouldn't be in it by\nThanksgiving.  I don't believe in moving in the dead of winter.\"\n\n\"We can wait till spring.  We're very comfortable in the old place,\"\nanswered his wife.  Then she broke out on him: \"What are you in such a\nhurry to get into that house for? Do you want to invite the Coreys to a\nhouse-warming?\"\n\nLapham looked at her without speaking.\n\n\"Don't you suppose I can see through you I declare, Silas Lapham, if I\ndidn't know different, I should say you were about the biggest fool!\nDon't you know ANYthing?  Don't you know that it wouldn't do to ask\nthose people to our house before they've asked us to theirs? They'd\nlaugh in our faces!\"\n\n\"I don't believe they'd laugh in our faces.  What's the difference\nbetween our asking them and their asking us?\" demanded the Colonel\nsulkily.\n\n\"Oh, well! If you don t see!\"\n\n\"Well, I DON'T see.  But I don't want to ask them to the house.  I\nsuppose, if I want to, I can invite him down to a fish dinner at\nTaft's.\"\n\nMrs. Lapham fell back in her chair, and let her work drop in her lap\nwith that \"Tckk!\" in which her sex knows how to express utter contempt\nand despair.\n\n\"What's the matter?\"\n\n\"Well, if you DO such a thing, Silas, I'll never speak to you again!\nIt's no USE! It's NO use! I did think, after you'd behaved so well\nabout Rogers, I might trust you a little.  But I see I can't. I presume\nas long as you live you'll have to be nosed about like a perfect--I\ndon't know what!\"\n\n\"What are you making such a fuss about?\" demanded Lapham, terribly\ncrestfallen, but trying to pluck up a spirit.  \"I haven't done anything\nyet.  I can't ask your advice about anything any more without having\nyou fly out.  Confound it! I shall do as I please after this.\"\n\nBut as if he could not endure that contemptuous atmosphere, he got up,\nand his wife heard him in the dining-room pouring himself out a glass\nof ice-water, and then heard him mount the stairs to their room, and\nslam its door after him.\n\n\"Do you know what your father's wanting to do now?\" Mrs. Lapham asked\nher eldest daughter, who lounged into the parlour a moment with her\nwrap stringing from her arm, while the younger went straight to bed.\n\"He wants to invite Mr. Corey's father to a fish dinner at Taft's!\"\n\nPenelope was yawning with her hand on her mouth; she stopped, and, with\na laugh of amused expectance, sank into a chair, her shoulders shrugged\nforward.\n\n\"Why! what in the world has put the Colonel up to that?\"\n\n\"Put him up to it! There's that fellow, who ought have come to see him\nlong ago, drops into his office this morning, and talks five minutes\nwith him, and your father is flattered out of his five senses.  He's\ncrazy to get in with those people, and I shall have a perfect battle to\nkeep him within bounds.\"\n\n\"Well, Persis, ma'am, you can't say but what you began it,\" said\nPenelope.\n\n\"Oh yes, I began it,\" confessed Mrs. Lapham.  \"Pen,\" she broke out,\n\"what do you suppose he means by it?\"\n\n\"Who? Mr. Corey's father? What does the Colonel think?\"\n\n\"Oh, the Colonel!\" cried Mrs. Lapham.  She added tremulously: \"Perhaps\nhe IS right.  He DID seem to take a fancy to her last summer, and now\nif he's called in that way . . .\" She left her daughter to distribute\nthe pronouns aright, and resumed: \"Of course, I should have said once\nthat there wasn't any question about it.  I should have said so last\nyear; and I don't know what it is keeps me from saying so now.  I\nsuppose I know a little more about things than I did; and your father's\nbeing so bent on it sets me all in a twitter.  He thinks his money can\ndo everything.  Well, I don't say but what it can, a good many.  And\n'Rene is as good a child as ever there was; and I don't see but what\nshe's pretty-appearing enough to suit any one.  She's pretty-behaved,\ntoo; and she IS the most capable girl.  I presume young men don't care\nvery much for such things nowadays; but there ain't a great many girls\ncan go right into the kitchen, and make such a custard as she did\nyesterday.  And look at the way she does, through the whole house! She\ncan't seem to go into a room without the things fly right into their\nplaces.  And if she had to do it to-morrow, she could make all her own\ndresses a great deal better than them we pay to do it.  I don't say but\nwhat he's about as nice a fellow as ever stepped.  But there! I'm\nashamed of going on so.\"\n\n\"Well, mother,\" said the girl after a pause, in which she looked as if\na little weary of the subject, \"why do you worry about it? If it's to\nbe it'll be, and if it isn't----\"\n\n\"Yes, that's what I tell your father.  But when it comes to myself, I\nsee how hard it is for him to rest quiet.  I'm afraid we shall all do\nsomething we'll repent of afterwards.\"\n\n\"Well, ma'am,\" said Penelope, \"I don't intend to do anything wrong; but\nif I do, I promise not to be sorry for it.  I'll go that far.  And I\nthink I wouldn't be sorry for it beforehand, if I were in your place,\nmother.  Let the Colonel go on! He likes to manoeuvre, and he isn't\ngoing to hurt any one.  The Corey family can take care of themselves, I\nguess.\"\n\nShe laughed in her throat, drawing down the corners of her mouth, and\nenjoying the resolution with which her mother tried to fling off the\nburden of her anxieties.  \"Pen! I believe you're right.  You always do\nsee things in such a light! There! I don't care if he brings him down\nevery day.\"\n\n\"Well, ma'am,\" said Pen, \"I don't believe 'Rene would, either.  She's\njust so indifferent!\"\n\nThe Colonel slept badly that night, and in the morning Mrs. Lapham came\nto breakfast without him.\n\n\"Your father ain't well,\" she reported.  \"He's had one of his turns.\"\n\n\"I should have thought he had two or three of them,\" said Penelope, \"by\nthe stamping round I heard.  Isn't he coming to breakfast?\"\n\n\"Not just yet,\" said her mother.  \"He's asleep, and he'll be all right\nif he gets his nap out.  I don't want you girls should make any great\nnoise.\" \"Oh, we'll be quiet enough,\" returned Penelope.  \"Well, I'm\nglad the Colonel isn't sojering.  At first I thought he might be\nsojering.\" She broke into a laugh, and, struggling indolently with it,\nlooked at her sister.  \"You don't think it'll be necessary for anybody\nto come down from the office and take orders from him while he's laid\nup, do you, mother?\" she inquired.\n\n\"Pen!\" cried Irene.\n\n\"He'll be well enough to go up on the ten o'clock boat,\" said the\nmother sharply.\n\n\"I think papa works too hard all through the summer.  Why don't you\nmake him take a rest, mamma?\" asked Irene.\n\n\"Oh, take a rest! The man slaves harder every year.  It used to be so\nthat he'd take a little time off now and then; but I declare, he hardly\never seems to breathe now away from his office.  And this year he says\nhe doesn't intend to go down to Lapham, except to see after the works\nfor a few days.  I don't know what to do with the man any more! Seems\nas if the more money he got, the more he wanted to get.  It scares me\nto think what would happen to him if he lost it.  I know one thing,\"\nconcluded Mrs. Lapham.  \"He shall not go back to the office to-day.\"\n\n\"Then he won't go up on the ten o'clock boat,\" Pen reminded her.\n\n\"No, he won't. You can just drive over to the hotel as soon as you're\nthrough, girls, and telegraph that he's not well, and won't be at the\noffice till to-morrow. I'm not going to have them send anybody down\nhere to bother him.\"\n\n\"That's a blow,\" said Pen.  \"I didn't know but they might send----\" she\nlooked demurely at her sister--\"Dennis!\"\n\n\"Mamma!\" cried Irene.\n\n\"Well, I declare, there's no living with this family any more,\" said\nPenelope.\n\n\"There, Pen, be done!\" commanded her mother.  But perhaps she did not\nintend to forbid her teasing.  It gave a pleasant sort of reality to\nthe affair that was in her mind, and made what she wished appear not\nonly possible but probable.\n\nLapham got up and lounged about, fretting and rebelling as each boat\ndeparted without him, through the day; before night he became very\ncross, in spite of the efforts of the family to soothe him, and\ngrumbled that he had been kept from going up to town.  \"I might as well\nhave gone as not,\" he repeated, till his wife lost her patience.\n\n\"Well, you shall go to-morrow, Silas, if you have to be carried to the\nboat.\"\n\n\"I declare,\" said Penelope, \"the Colonel don't pet worth a cent.\"\n\nThe six o'clock boat brought Corey.  The girls were sitting on the\npiazza, and Irene saw him first.\n\n\"O Pen!\" she whispered, with her heart in her face; and Penelope had no\ntime for mockery before he was at the steps.\n\n\"I hope Colonel Lapham isn't ill,\" he said, and they could hear their\nmother engaged in a moral contest with their father indoors.\n\n\"Go and put on your coat! I say you shall! It don't matter HOW he sees\nyou at the office, shirt-sleeves or not.  You're in a gentleman's house\nnow--or you ought to be--and you shan't see company in your\ndressing-gown.\"\n\nPenelope hurried in to subdue her mother's anger.\n\n\"Oh, he's very much better, thank you!\" said Irene, speaking up loudly\nto drown the noise of the controversy.\n\n\"I'm glad of that,\" said Corey, and when she led him indoors the\nvanquished Colonel met his visitor in a double-breasted frock-coat,\nwhich he was still buttoning up.  He could not persuade himself at once\nthat Corey had not come upon some urgent business matter, and when he\nwas clear that he had come out of civility, surprise mingled with his\ngratification that he should be the object of solicitude to the young\nman.  In Lapham's circle of acquaintance they complained when they were\nsick, but they made no womanish inquiries after one another's health,\nand certainly paid no visits of sympathy till matters were serious.  He\nwould have enlarged upon the particulars of his indisposition if he had\nbeen allowed to do so; and after tea, which Corey took with them, he\nwould have remained to entertain him if his wife had not sent him to\nbed.  She followed him to see that he took some medicine she had\nprescribed for him, but she went first to Penelope's room, where she\nfound the girl with a book in her hand, which she was not reading.\n\n\"You better go down,\" said the mother.  \"I've got to go to your father,\nand Irene is all alone with Mr. Corey; and I know she'll be on pins and\nneedles without you're there to help make it go off.\"\n\n\"She'd better try to get along without me, mother,\" said Penelope\nsoberly.  \"I can't always be with them.\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied Mrs. Lapham, \"then I must.  There'll be a perfect\nQuaker meeting down there.\"\n\n\"Oh, I guess 'Rene will find something to say if you leave her to\nherself.  Or if she don't, HE must.  It'll be all right for you to go\ndown when you get ready; but I shan't go till toward the last.  If he's\ncoming here to see Irene--and I don't believe he's come on father's\naccount--he wants to see her and not me.  If she can't interest him\nalone, perhaps he'd as well find it out now as any time.  At any rate,\nI guess you'd better make the experiment.  You'll know whether it's a\nsuccess if he comes again.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the mother, \"may be you're right.  I'll go down directly.\nIt does seem as if he did mean something, after all.\"\n\nMrs. Lapham did not hasten to return to her guest.  In her own girlhood\nit was supposed that if a young man seemed to be coming to see a girl,\nit was only common-sense to suppose that he wished to see her alone;\nand her life in town had left Mrs. Lapham's simple traditions in this\nrespect unchanged.  She did with her daughter as her mother would have\ndone with her.\n\nWhere Penelope sat with her book, she heard the continuous murmur of\nvoices below, and after a long interval she heard her mother descend.\nShe did not read the open book that lay in her lap, though she kept her\neyes fast on the print.  Once she rose and almost shut the door, so\nthat she could scarcely hear; then she opened it wide again with a\nself-disdainful air, and resolutely went back to her book, which again\nshe did not read.  But she remained in her room till it was nearly time\nfor Corey to return to his boat.\n\nWhen they were alone again, Irene made a feint of scolding her for\nleaving her to entertain Mr. Corey.\n\n\"Why! didn't you have a pleasant call?\" asked Penelope.\n\nIrene threw her arms round her.  \"Oh, it was a SPLENDID call! I didn't\nsuppose I could make it go off so well.  We talked nearly the whole\ntime about you!\"\n\n\"I don't think THAT was a very interesting subject.\"\n\n\"He kept asking about you.  He asked everything.  You don't know how\nmuch he thinks of you, Pen.  O Pen!  what do you think made him come?\nDo you think he really did come to see how papa was?\" Irene buried her\nface in her sister's neck.\n\nPenelope stood with her arms at her side, submitting.  \"Well,\" she\nsaid, \"I don't think he did, altogether.\"\n\nIrene, all glowing, released her.  \"Don't you--don't you REALLY? O Pen!\ndon't you think he IS nice? Don't you think he's handsome? Don't you\nthink I behaved horridly when we first met him this evening, not\nthanking him for coming? I know he thinks I've no manners.  But it\nseemed as if it would be thanking him for coming to see me.  Ought I to\nhave asked him to come again, when he said good-night? I didn't; I\ncouldn't. Do you believe he'll think I don't want him to? You don't\nbelieve he would keep coming if he didn't--want to----\"\n\n\"He hasn't kept coming a great deal, yet,\" suggested Penelope.\n\n\"No; I know he hasn't. But if he--if he should?\"\n\n\"Then I should think he wanted to.\"\n\n\"Oh, would you--WOULD you? Oh, how good you always are, Pen! And you\nalways say what you think.  I wish there was some one coming to see you\ntoo.  That's all that I don't like about it.  Perhaps----He was telling\nabout his friend there in Texas----\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Penelope, \"his friend couldn't call often from Texas.  You\nneedn't ask Mr. Corey to trouble about me, 'Rene. I think I can manage\nto worry along, if you're satisfied.\"\n\n\"Oh, I AM, Pen.  When do you suppose he'll come again?\" Irene pushed\nsome of Penelope's things aside on the dressing-case, to rest her elbow\nand talk at ease.  Penelope came up and put them back.\n\n\"Well, not to-night,\" she said; \"and if that's what you're sitting up\nfor----\"\n\nIrene caught her round the neck again, and ran out of the room.\n\nThe Colonel was packed off on the eight o'clock boat the next morning;\nbut his recovery did not prevent Corey from repeating his visit in a\nweek.  This time Irene came radiantly up to Penelope's room, where she\nhad again withdrawn herself.  \"You must come down, Pen,\" she said.\n\"He's asked if you're not well, and mamma says you've got to come.\"\n\nAfter that Penelope helped Irene through with her calls, and talked\nthem over with her far into the night after Corey was gone.  But when\nthe impatient curiosity of her mother pressed her for some opinion of\nthe affair, she said, \"You know as much as I do, mother.\"\n\n\"Don't he ever say anything to you about her--praise her up, any?\"\n\n\"He's never mentioned Irene to me.\"\n\n\"He hasn't to me, either,\" said Mrs. Lapham, with a sigh of trouble.\n\"Then what makes him keep coming?\"\n\n\"I can't tell you.  One thing, he says there isn't a house open in\nBoston where he's acquainted.  Wait till some of his friends get back,\nand then if he keeps coming, it'll be time to inquire.\"\n\n\"Well!\" said the mother; but as the weeks passed she was less and less\nable to attribute Corey's visits to his loneliness in town, and turned\nto her husband for comfort.\n\n\"Silas, I don't know as we ought to let young Corey keep coming so.  I\ndon't quite like it, with all his family away.\"\n\n\"He's of age,\" said the Colonel.  \"He can go where he pleases.  It\ndon't matter whether his family's here or not.\"\n\n\"Yes, but if they don't want he should come? Should you feel just right\nabout letting him?\"\n\n\"How're you going to stop him? I swear, Persis, I don't know what's got\nover you! What is it? You didn't use to be so.  But to hear you talk,\nyou'd think those Coreys were too good for this world, and we wa'n't\nfit for 'em to walk on.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to have 'em say we took an advantage of their being away\nand tolled him on.\"\n\n\"I should like to HEAR 'em say it!\" cried Lapham.  \"Or anybody!\"\n\n\"Well,\" said his wife, relinquishing this point of anxiety, \"I can't\nmake out whether he cares anything for her or not.  And Pen can't tell\neither; or else she won't.\"\n\n\"Oh, I guess he cares for her, fast enough,\" said the Colonel.\n\n\"I can't make out that he's said or done the first thing to show it.\"\n\n\"Well, I was better than a year getting my courage up.\"\n\n\"Oh, that was different,\" said Mrs. Lapham, in contemptuous dismissal\nof the comparison, and yet with a certain fondness.  \"I guess, if he\ncared for her, a fellow in his position wouldn't be long getting up his\ncourage to speak to Irene.\"\n\nLapham brought his fist down on the table between them.\n\n\"Look here, Persis! Once for all, now, don't you ever let me hear you\nsay anything like that again! I'm worth nigh on to a million, and I've\nmade it every cent myself; and my girls are the equals of anybody, I\ndon't care who it is.  He ain't the fellow to take on any airs; but if\nhe ever tries it with me, I'll send him to the right about mighty\nquick.  I'll have a talk with him, if----\"\n\n\"No, no; don't do that!\" implored his wife.  \"I didn't mean anything.\nI don't know as I meant ANYthing.  He's just as unassuming as he can\nbe, and I think Irene's a match for anybody.  You just let things go\non.  It'll be all right.  You never can tell how it is with young\npeople.  Perhaps SHE'S offish.  Now you ain't--you ain't going to say\nanything?\"\n\nLapham suffered himself to be persuaded, the more easily, no doubt,\nbecause after his explosion he must have perceived that his pride\nitself stood in the way of what his pride had threatened.  He contented\nhimself with his wife's promise that she would never again present that\noffensive view of the case, and she did not remain without a certain\nsupport in his sturdy self-assertion.\n\n\n\nXII.\n\n\nMRS.  COREY returned with her daughters in the early days of October,\nhaving passed three or four weeks at Intervale after leaving Bar\nHarbour.  They were somewhat browner than they were when they left town\nin June, but they were not otherwise changed.  Lily, the elder of the\ngirls, had brought back a number of studies of kelp and toadstools,\nwith accessory rocks and rotten logs, which she would never finish up\nand never show any one, knowing the slightness of their merit.  Nanny,\nthe younger, had read a great many novels with a keen sense of their\ninaccuracy as representations of life, and had seen a great deal of\nlife with a sad regret for its difference from fiction.  They were both\nnice girls, accomplished, well-dressed of course, and well enough\nlooking; but they had met no one at the seaside or the mountains whom\ntheir taste would allow to influence their fate, and they had come home\nto the occupations they had left, with no hopes and no fears to\ndistract them.\n\nIn the absence of these they were fitted to take the more vivid\ninterest in their brother's affairs, which they could see weighed upon\ntheir mother's mind after the first hours of greeting.\n\n\"Oh, it seems to have been going on, and your father has never written\na word about it,\" she said, shaking her head.\n\n\"What good would it have done?\" asked Nanny, who was little and fair,\nwith rings of light hair that filled a bonnet-front very prettily; she\nlooked best in a bonnet.  \"It would only have worried you.  He could\nnot have stopped Tom; you couldn't, when you came home to do it.\"\n\n\"I dare say papa didn't know much about it,\" suggested Lily.  She was a\ntall, lean, dark girl, who looked as if she were not quite warm enough,\nand whom you always associated with wraps of different aesthetic effect\nafter you had once seen her.\n\nIt is a serious matter always to the women of his family when a young\nman gives them cause to suspect that he is interested in some other\nwoman.  A son-in-law or brother-in-law does not enter the family; he\nneed not be caressed or made anything of; but the son's or brother's\nwife has a claim upon his mother and sisters which they cannot deny.\nSome convention of their sex obliges them to show her affection, to\nlike or to seem to like her, to take her to their intimacy, however\nodious she may be to them.  With the Coreys it was something more than\nan affair of sentiment.  They were by no means poor, and they were not\ndependent money-wise upon Tom Corey; but the mother had come, without\nknowing it, to rely upon his sense, his advice in everything, and the\nsisters, seeing him hitherto so indifferent to girls, had insensibly\ngrown to regard him as altogether their own till he should be released,\nnot by his marriage, but by theirs, an event which had not approached\nwith the lapse of time.  Some kinds of girls--they believed that they\ncould readily have chosen a kind--might have taken him without taking\nhim from them; but this generosity could not be hoped for in such a\ngirl as Miss Lapham.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" urged their mother, \"it would not be so bad.  She seemed an\naffectionate little thing with her mother, without a great deal of\ncharacter though she was so capable about some things.\"\n\n\"Oh, she'll be an affectionate little thing with Tom too, you may be\nsure,\" said Nanny.  \"And that characterless capability becomes the most\nin tense narrow-mindedness.  She'll think we were against her from the\nbeginning.\"\n\n\"She has no cause for that,\" Lily interposed, \"and we shall not give\nher any.\"\n\n\"Yes, we shall,\" retorted Nanny.  \"We can't help it; and if we can't,\nher own ignorance would be cause enough.\"\n\n\"I can't feel that she's altogether ignorant,\" said Mrs. Corey justly.\n\n\"Of course she can read and write,\" admitted Nanny.\n\n\"I can't imagine what he finds to talk about with her,\" said Lily.\n\n\"Oh, THAT'S very simple,\" returned her sister.\n\n\"They talk about themselves, with occasional references to each other.\nI have heard people 'going on' on the hotel piazzas.  She's\nembroidering, or knitting, or tatting, or something of that kind; and\nhe says she seems quite devoted to needlework, and she says, yes, she\nhas a perfect passion for it, and everybody laughs at her for it; but\nshe can't help it, she always was so from a child, and supposes she\nalways shall be,--with remote and minute particulars.  And she ends by\nsaying that perhaps he does not like people to tat, or knit, or\nembroider, or whatever.  And he says, oh, yes, he does; what could make\nher think such a thing? but for his part he likes boating rather\nbetter, or if you're in the woods camping.  Then she lets him take up\none corner of her work, and perhaps touch her fingers; and that\nencourages him to say that he supposes nothing could induce her to drop\nher work long enough to go down on the rocks, or out among the\nhuckleberry bushes; and she puts her head on one side, and says she\ndoesn't know really.  And then they go, and he lies at her feet on the\nrocks, or picks huckleberries and drops them in her lap, and they go on\ntalking about themselves, and comparing notes to see how they differ\nfrom each other.  And----\"\n\n\"That will do, Nanny,\" said her mother.\n\nLily smiled autumnally.  \"Oh, disgusting!\"\n\n\"Disgusting? Not at all!\" protested her sister.  \"It's very amusing\nwhen you see it, and when you do it----\"\n\n\"It's always a mystery what people see in each other,\" observed Mrs.\nCorey severely.\n\n\"Yes,\" Nanny admitted, \"but I don't know that there is much comfort for\nus in the application.\" \"No, there isn't,\" said her mother.\n\n\"The most that we can do is to hope for the best till we know the\nworst.  Of course we shall make the best of the worst when it comes.\"\n\n\"Yes, and perhaps it would not be so very bad.  I was saying to your\nfather when I was here in July that those things can always be managed.\nYou must face them as if they were nothing out of the way, and try not\nto give any cause for bitterness among ourselves.\"\n\n\"That's true.  But I don't believe in too much resignation beforehand.\nIt amounts to concession,\" said Nanny.\n\n\"Of course we should oppose it in all proper ways,\" returned her mother.\n\nLily had ceased to discuss the matter.  In virtue of her artistic\ntemperament, she was expected not to be very practical.  It was her\nmother and her sister who managed, submitting to the advice and consent\nof Corey what they intended to do.\n\n\"Your father wrote me that he had called on Colonel Lapham at his place\nof business,\" said Mrs. Corey, seizing her first chance of approaching\nthe subject with her son.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Corey.  \"A dinner was father's idea, but he came down to a\ncall, at my suggestion.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Mrs. Corey, in a tone of relief, as if the statement threw a\nnew light on the fact that Corey had suggested the visit.  \"He said so\nlittle about it in his letter that I didn't know just how it came\nabout.\"\n\n\"I thought it was right they should meet,\" explained the son, \"and so\ndid father.  I was glad that I suggested it, afterward; it was\nextremely gratifying to Colonel Lapham.\"\n\n\"Oh, it was quite right in every way.  I suppose you have seen\nsomething of the family during the summer.\"\n\n\"Yes, a good deal.  I've been down at Nantasket rather often.\"\n\nMrs. Corey let her eyes droop.  Then she asked: \"Are they well?\"\n\n\"Yes, except Lapham himself, now and then.  I went down once or twice\nto see him.  He hasn't given himself any vacation this summer; he has\nsuch a passion for his business that I fancy he finds it hard being\naway from it at any time, and he's made his new house an excuse for\nstaying.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, his house! Is it to be something fine?\"\n\n\"Yes; it's a beautiful house.  Seymour is doing it.\"\n\n\"Then, of course, it will be very handsome.  I suppose the young ladies\nare very much taken up with it; and Mrs. Lapham.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Lapham, yes.  I don't think the young ladies care so much about\nit.\"\n\n\"It must be for them.  Aren't they ambitious?\" asked Mrs. Corey,\ndelicately feeling her way.\n\nHer son thought a while.  Then he answered with a smile--\n\n\"No, I don't really think they are.  They are unambitious, I should\nsay.\" Mrs. Corey permitted herself a long breath.  But her son added,\n\"It's the parents who are ambitious for them,\" and her respiration\nbecame shorter again.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said.\n\n\"They're very simple, nice girls,\" pursued Corey.  \"I think you'll like\nthe elder, when you come to know her.\"\n\nWhen you come to know her.  The words implied an expectation that the\ntwo families were to be better acquainted.\n\n\"Then she is more intellectual than her sister?\" Mrs. Corey ventured.\n\n\"Intellectual?\" repeated her son.  \"No; that isn't the word, quite.\nThough she certainly has more mind.\"\n\n\"The younger seemed very sensible.\"\n\n\"Oh, sensible, yes.  And as practical as she's pretty.  She can do all\nsorts of things, and likes to be doing them.  Don't you think she's an\nextraordinary beauty?\"\n\n\"Yes--yes, she is,\" said Mrs. Corey, at some cost.\n\n\"She's good, too,\" said Corey, \"and perfectly innocent and transparent.\nI think you will like her the better the more you know her.\"\n\n\"I thought her very nice from the beginning,\" said the mother\nheroically; and then nature asserted itself in her.  \"But I should be\nafraid that she might perhaps be a little bit tiresome at last; her\nrange of ideas seemed so extremely limited.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's what I was afraid of.  But, as a matter of fact, she\nisn't. She interests you by her very limitations.  You can see the\nworking of her mind, like that of a child.  She isn't at all conscious\neven of her beauty.\"\n\n\"I don't believe young men can tell whether girls are conscious or\nnot,\" said Mrs. Corey.  \"But I am not saying the Miss Laphams are\nnot----\" Her son sat musing, with an inattentive smile on his face.\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Oh! nothing.  I was thinking of Miss Lapham and something she was\nsaying.  She's very droll, you know.\"\n\n\"The elder sister? Yes, you told me that.  Can you see the workings of\nher mind too?\"\n\n\"No; she's everything that's unexpected.\" Corey fell into another\nreverie, and smiled again; but he did not offer to explain what amused\nhim, and his mother would not ask.\n\n\"I don't know what to make of his admiring the girl so frankly,\" she\nsaid afterward to her husband.  \"That couldn't come naturally till\nafter he had spoken to her, and I feel sure that he hasn't yet.\"\n\n\"You women haven't risen yet--it's an evidence of the backwardness of\nyour sex--to a conception of the Bismarck idea in diplomacy.  If a man\npraises one woman, you still think he's in love with another.  Do you\nmean that because Tom didn't praise the elder sister so much, he HAS\nspoken to HER?\"\n\nMrs. Corey refused the consequence, saying that it did not follow.\n\"Besides, he did praise her.\"\n\n\"You ought to be glad that matters are in such good shape, then.  At\nany rate, you can do absolutely nothing.\"\n\n\"Oh! I know it,\" sighed Mrs. Corey.  \"I wish Tom would be a little\nopener with me.\"\n\n\"He's as open as it's in the nature of an American-born son to be with\nhis parents.  I dare say if you'd asked him plumply what he meant in\nregard to the young lady, he would have told you--if he knew.\"\n\n\"Why, don't you think he does know, Bromfield?\"\n\n\"I'm not at all sure he does.  You women think that because a young man\ndangles after a girl, or girls, he's attached to them.  It doesn't at\nall follow.  He dangles because he must, and doesn't know what to do\nwith his time, and because they seem to like it.  I dare say that Tom\nhas dangled a good deal in this instance because there was nobody else\nin town.\"\n\n\"Do you really think so?\"\n\n\"I throw out the suggestion.  And it strikes me that a young lady\ncouldn't do better than stay in or near Boston during the summer.  Most\nof the young men are here, kept by business through the week, with\nevenings available only on the spot, or a few miles off.  What was the\nproportion of the sexes at the seashore and the mountains?\"\n\n\"Oh, twenty girls at least for even an excuse of a man.  It's shameful.\"\n\n\"You see, I am right in one part of my theory.  Why shouldn't I be\nright in the rest?\"\n\n\"I wish you were.  And yet I can't say that I do.  Those things are\nvery serious with girls.  I shouldn't like Tom to have been going to\nsee those people if he meant nothing by it.\"\n\n\"And you wouldn't like it if he did.  You are difficult, my dear.\" Her\nhusband pulled an open newspaper toward him from the table.\n\n\"I feel that it wouldn't be at all like him to do so,\" said Mrs. Corey,\ngoing on to entangle herself in her words, as women often do when their\nideas are perfectly clear.  \"Don't go to reading, please, Bromfield! I\nam really worried about this matter I must know how much it means.  I\ncan't let it go on so.  I don't see how you can rest easy without\nknowing.\"\n\n\"I don't in the least know what's going to become of me when I die; and\nyet I sleep well,\" replied Bromfield Corey, putting his newspaper aside.\n\n\"Ah! but this is a very different thing.\"\n\n\"So much more serious? Well, what can you do? We had this out when you\nwere here in the summer, and you agreed with me then that we could do\nnothing.  The situation hasn't changed at all.\"\n\n\"Yes, it has; it has continued the same,\" said Mrs. Corey, again\nexpressing the fact by a contradiction in terms.  \"I think I must ask\nTom outright.\"\n\n\"You know you can't do that, my dear.\"\n\n\"Then why doesn't he tell us?\"\n\n\"Ah, that's what HE can't do, if he's making love to Miss Irene--that's\nher name, I believe--on the American plan.  He will tell us after he\nhas told HER.  That was the way I did.  Don't ignore our own youth,\nAnna.  It was a long while ago, I'll admit.\"\n\n\"It was very different,\" said Mrs. Corey, a little shaken.\n\n\"I don't see how.  I dare say Mamma Lapham knows whether Tom is in love\nwith her daughter or not; and no doubt Papa Lapham knows it at second\nhand.  But we shall not know it until the girl herself does.  Depend\nupon that.  Your mother knew, and she told your father; but my poor\nfather knew nothing about it till we were engaged; and I had been\nhanging about--dangling, as you call it----\"\n\n\"No, no; YOU called it that.\"\n\n\"Was it I?--for a year or more.\"\n\nThe wife could not refuse to be a little consoled by the image of her\nyoung love which the words conjured up, however little she liked its\nrelation to her son's interest in Irene Lapham.  She smiled pensively.\n\"Then you think it hasn't come to an understanding with them yet?\"\n\n\"An understanding? Oh, probably.\"\n\n\"An explanation, then?\"\n\n\"The only logical inference from what we've been saying is that it\nhasn't. But I don't ask you to accept it on that account.  May I read\nnow, my dear?\"\n\n\"Yes, you may read now,\" said Mrs. Corey, with one of those sighs which\nperhaps express a feminine sense of the unsatisfactoriness of husbands\nin general, rather than a personal discontent with her own.\n\n\"Thank you, my dear; then I think I'll smoke too,\" said Bromfield\nCorey, lighting a cigar.\n\nShe left him in peace, and she made no further attempt upon her son's\nconfidence.  But she was not inactive for that reason.  She did not, of\ncourse, admit to herself, and far less to others, the motive with which\nshe went to pay an early visit to the Laphams, who had now come up from\nNantasket to Nankeen Square.  She said to her daughters that she had\nalways been a little ashamed of using her acquaintance with them to get\nmoney for her charity, and then seeming to drop it.  Besides, it seemed\nto her that she ought somehow to recognise the business relation that\nTom had formed with the father; they must not think that his family\ndisapproved of what he had done.  \"Yes, business is business,\" said\nNanny, with a laugh.  \"Do you wish us to go with you again?\"\n\n\"No; I will go alone this time,\" replied the mother with dignity.\n\nHer coupe now found its way to Nankeen Square without difficulty, and\nshe sent up a card, which Mrs. Lapham received in the presence of her\ndaughter Penelope.\n\n\"I presume I've got to see her,\" she gasped.\n\n\"Well, don't look so guilty, mother,\" joked the girl; \"you haven't been\ndoing anything so VERY wrong.\"\n\n\"It seems as if I HAD.  I don't know what's come over me.  I wasn't\nafraid of the woman before, but now I don't seem to feel as if I could\nlook her in the face.  He's been coming here of his own accord, and I\nfought against his coming long enough, goodness knows.  I didn't want\nhim to come.  And as far forth as that goes, we're as respectable as\nthey are; and your father's got twice their money, any day.  We've no\nneed to go begging for their favour.  I guess they were glad enough to\nget him in with your father.\"\n\n\"Yes, those are all good points, mother,\" said the girl; \"and if you\nkeep saying them over, and count a hundred every time before you speak,\nI guess you'll worry through.\"\n\nMrs. Lapham had been fussing distractedly with her hair and ribbons, in\npreparation for her encounter with Mrs. Corey.  She now drew in a long\nquivering breath, stared at her daughter without seeing her, and\nhurried downstairs.  It was true that when she met Mrs. Corey before\nshe had not been awed by her; but since then she had learned at least\nher own ignorance of the world, and she had talked over the things she\nhad misconceived and the things she had shrewdly guessed so much that\nshe could not meet her on the former footing of equality.  In spite of\nas brave a spirit and as good a conscience as woman need have, Mrs.\nLapham cringed inwardly, and tremulously wondered what her visitor had\ncome for.  She turned from pale to red, and was hardly coherent in her\ngreetings; she did not know how they got to where Mrs. Corey was saying\nexactly the right things about her son's interest and satisfaction in\nhis new business, and keeping her eyes fixed on Mrs. Lapham's, reading\nher uneasiness there, and making her feel, in spite of her indignant\ninnocence, that she had taken a base advantage of her in her absence to\nget her son away from her and marry him to Irene.  Then, presently,\nwhile this was painfully revolving itself in Mrs. Lapham's mind, she\nwas aware of Mrs. Corey's asking if she was not to have the pleasure of\nseeing Miss Irene.\n\n\"No; she's out, just now,\" said Mrs. Lapham.  \"I don't know just when\nshe'll be in.  She went to get a book.\" And here she turned red again,\nknowing that Irene had gone to get the book because it was one that\nCorey had spoken of.\n\n\"Oh! I'm sorry,\" said Mrs. Corey.  \"I had hoped to see her.  And your\nother daughter, whom I never met?\"\n\n\"Penelope?\" asked Mrs. Lapham, eased a little.  \"She is at home.  I\nwill go and call her.\" The Laphams had not yet thought of spending\ntheir superfluity on servants who could be rung for; they kept two\ngirls and a man to look after the furnace, as they had for the last ten\nyears.  If Mrs. Lapham had rung in the parlour, her second girl would\nhave gone to the street door to see who was there.  She went upstairs\nfor Penelope herself, and the girl, after some rebellious derision,\nreturned with her.\n\nMrs. Corey took account of her, as Penelope withdrew to the other side\nof the room after their introduction, and sat down, indolently\nsubmissive on the surface to the tests to be applied, and following\nMrs. Corey's lead of the conversation in her odd drawl.\n\n\"You young ladies will be glad to be getting into your new house,\" she\nsaid politely.\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Penelope.  \"We're so used to this one.\"\n\nMrs. Corey looked a little baffled, but she said sympathetically, \"Of\ncourse, you will be sorry to leave your old home.\"\n\nMrs. Lapham could not help putting in on behalf of her daughters: \"I\nguess if it was left to the girls to say, we shouldn't leave it at all.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed!\" said Mrs. Corey; \"are they so much attached?  But I can\nquite understand it.  My children would be heart-broken too if we were\nto leave the old place.\" She turned to Penelope.  \"But you must think\nof the lovely new house, and the beautiful position.\"\n\n\"Yes, I suppose we shall get used to them too,\" said Penelope, in\nresponse to this didactic consolation.\n\n\"Oh, I could even imagine your getting very fond of them,\" pursued Mrs.\nCorey patronisingly.  \"My son has told me of the lovely outlook you're\nto have over the water.  He thinks you have such a beautiful house.  I\nbelieve he had the pleasure of meeting you all there when he first came\nhome.\"\n\n\"Yes, I think he was our first visitor.\"\n\n\"He is a great admirer of your house,\" said Mrs. Corey, keeping her\neyes very sharply, however politely, on Penelope's face, as if to\nsurprise there the secret of any other great admiration of her son's\nthat might helplessly show itself.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the girl, \"he's been there several times with father; and\nhe wouldn't be allowed to overlook any of its good points.\"\n\nHer mother took a little more courage from her daughter's tranquillity.\n\n\"The girls make such fun of their father's excitement about his\nbuilding, and the way he talks it into everybody.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed!\" said Mrs. Corey, with civil misunderstanding and inquiry.\n\nPenelope flushed, and her mother went on: \"I tell him he's more of a\nchild about it than any of them.\"\n\n\"Young people are very philosophical nowadays,\" remarked Mrs. Corey.\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" said Mrs. Lapham.  \"I tell them they've always had\neverything, so that nothing's a surprise to them.  It was different\nwith us in our young days.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Corey, without assenting.\n\n\"I mean the Colonel and myself,\" explained Mrs. Lapham.\n\n\"Oh yes--yes!\" said Mrs. Corey.\n\n\"I'm sure,\" the former went on, rather helplessly, \"we had to work hard\nenough for everything we got.  And so we appreciated it.\"\n\n\"So many things were not done for young people then,\" said Mrs. Corey,\nnot recognising the early-hardships standpoint of Mrs. Lapham.  \"But I\ndon't know that they are always the better for it now,\" she added\nvaguely, but with the satisfaction we all feel in uttering a just\ncommonplace.\n\n\"It's rather hard living up to blessings that you've always had,\" said\nPenelope.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Mrs. Corey distractedly, and coming back to her slowly\nfrom the virtuous distance to which she had absented herself.  She\nlooked at the girl searchingly again, as if to determine whether this\nwere a touch of the drolling her son had spoken of.  But she only\nadded: \"You will enjoy the sunsets on the Back Bay so much.\" \"Well, not\nunless they're new ones,\" said Penelope.  \"I don't believe I could\npromise to enjoy any sunsets that I was used to, a great deal.\"\n\nMrs. Corey looked at her with misgiving, hardening into dislike.  \"No,\"\nshe breathed vaguely.  \"My son spoke of the fine effect of the lights\nabout the hotel from your cottage at Nantasket,\" she said to Mrs.\nLapham.\n\n\"Yes, they're splendid!\" exclaimed that lady.  \"I guess the girls went\ndown every night with him to see them from the rocks.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Corey, a little dryly; and she permitted herself to\nadd: \"He spoke of those rocks.  I suppose both you young ladies spend a\ngreat deal of your time on them when you're there.  At Nahant my\nchildren were constantly on them.\"\n\n\"Irene likes the rocks,\" said Penelope.  \"I don't care much about\nthem,--especially at night.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed! I suppose you find it quite as well looking at the lights\ncomfortably from the veranda.\"\n\n\"No; you can't see them from the house.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Mrs. Corey.  After a perceptible pause, she turned to Mrs.\nLapham.  \"I don't know what my son would have done for a breath of sea\nair this summer, if you had not allowed him to come to Nantasket.  He\nwasn't willing to leave his business long enough to go anywhere else.\"\n\n\"Yes, he's a born business man,\" responded Mrs. Lapham\nenthusiastically.  \"If it's born in you, it's bound to come out.\nThat's what the Colonel is always saying about Mr. Corey.  He says it's\nborn in him to be a business man, and he can't help it.\" She recurred\nto Corey gladly because she felt that she had not said enough of him\nwhen his mother first spoke of his connection with the business.  \"I\ndon't believe,\" she went on excitedly, \"that Colonel Lapham has ever\nhad anybody with him that he thought more of.\"\n\n\"You have all been very kind to my son,\" said Mrs. Corey in\nacknowledgment, and stiffly bowing a little, \"and we feel greatly\nindebted to you.  Very much so.\" At these grateful expressions Mrs.\nLapham reddened once more, and murmured that it had been very pleasant\nto them, she was sure.  She glanced at her daughter for support, but\nPenelope was looking at Mrs. Corey, who doubtless saw her from the\ncorner of her eyes, though she went on speaking to her mother.\n\n\"I was sorry to hear from him that Mr.--Colonel?--Lapham had not been\nquite well this summer.  I hope he's better now?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, indeed,\" replied Mrs. Lapham; \"he's all right now.  He's\nhardly ever been sick, and he don't know how to take care of himself.\nThat's all.  We don't any of us; we're all so well.\"\n\n\"Health is a great blessing,\" sighed Mrs. Corey.\n\n\"Yes, so it is.  How is your oldest daughter?\" inquired Mrs. Lapham.\n\"Is she as delicate as ever?\"\n\n\"She seems to be rather better since we returned.\" And now Mrs. Corey,\nas if forced to the point, said bunglingly that the young ladies had\nwished to come with her, but had been detained.  She based her\nstatement upon Nanny's sarcastic demand; and, perhaps seeing it topple\na little, she rose hastily, to get away from its fall.  \"But we shall\nhope for some--some other occasion,\" she said vaguely, and she put on a\nparting smile, and shook hands with Mrs. Lapham and Penelope, and then,\nafter some lingering commonplaces, got herself out of the house.\n\nPenelope and her mother were still looking at each other, and trying to\ngrapple with the effect or purport of the visit, when Irene burst in\nupon them from the outside.\n\n\"O mamma! wasn't that Mrs. Corey's carriage just drove away?\"\n\nPenelope answered with her laugh.  \"Yes! You've just missed the most\ndelightful call, 'Rene. So easy and pleasant every way.  Not a bit\nstiff! Mrs. Corey was so friendly!  She didn't make one feel at all as\nif she'd bought me, and thought she'd given too much; and mother held\nup her head as if she were all wool and a yard wide, and she would just\nlike to have anybody deny it.\"\n\nIn a few touches of mimicry she dashed off a sketch of the scene: her\nmother's trepidation, and Mrs. Corey's well-bred repose and polite\nscrutiny of them both.  She ended by showing how she herself had sat\nhuddled up in a dark corner, mute with fear.\n\n\"If she came to make us say and do the wrong thing, she must have gone\naway happy; and it's a pity you weren't here to help, Irene.  I don't\nknow that I aimed to make a bad impression, but I guess I\nsucceeded--even beyond my deserts.\" She laughed; then suddenly she\nflashed out in fierce earnest.  \"If I missed doing anything that could\nmake me as hateful to her as she made herself to me----\" She checked\nherself, and began to laugh.  Her laugh broke, and the tears started\ninto her eyes; she ran out of the room, and up the stairs.\n\n\"What--what does it mean?\" asked Irene in a daze.\n\nMrs. Lapham was still in the chilly torpor to which Mrs. Corey's call\nhad reduced her.  Penelope's vehemence did not rouse her.  She only\nshook her head absently, and said, \"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Why should Pen care what impression she made? I didn't suppose it\nwould make any difference to her whether Mrs. Corey liked her or not.\"\n\n\"I didn't, either.  But I could see that she was just as nervous as she\ncould be, every minute of the time.  I guess she didn't like Mrs. Corey\nany too well from the start, and she couldn't seem to act like herself.\"\n\n\"Tell me about it, mamma,\" said Irene, dropping into a chair.\n\n\nMrs. Corey described the interview to her husband on her return home.\n\"Well, and what are your inferences?\" he asked.\n\n\"They were extremely embarrassed and excited--that is, the mother.  I\ndon't wish to do her injustice, but she certainly behaved consciously.\"\n\n\"You made her feel so, I dare say, Anna.  I can imagine how terrible\nyou must have been in the character of an accusing spirit, too\nlady-like to say anything.  What did you hint?\"\n\n\"I hinted nothing,\" said Mrs. Corey, descending to the weakness of\ndefending herself.  \"But I saw quite enough to convince me that the\ngirl is in love with Tom, and the mother knows it.\"\n\n\"That was very unsatisfactory.  I supposed you went to find out whether\nTom was in love with the girl.  Was she as pretty as ever?\"\n\n\"I didn't see her; she was not at home; I saw her sister.\"\n\n\"I don't know that I follow you quite, Anna.  But no matter.  What was\nthe sister like?\"\n\n\"A thoroughly disagreeable young woman.\"\n\n\"What did she do?\"\n\n\"Nothing. She's far too sly for that.  But that was the impression.\"\n\n\"Then you didn't find her so amusing as Tom does?\"\n\n\"I found her pert.  There's no other word for it.  She says things to\npuzzle you and put you out.\"\n\n\"Ah, that was worse than pert, Anna; that was criminal.  Well, let us\nthank heaven the younger one is so pretty.\"\n\nMrs. Corey did not reply directly.  \"Bromfield,\" she said, after a\nmoment of troubled silence, \"I have been thinking over your plan, and I\ndon't see why it isn't the right thing.\"\n\n\"What is my plan?\" inquired Bromfield Corey.\n\n\"A dinner.\"\n\nHer husband began to laugh.  \"Ah, you overdid the accusing-spirit\nbusiness, and this is reparation.\" But Mrs. Corey hurried on, with\ncombined dignity and anxiety--\n\n\"We can't ignore Tom's intimacy with them--it amounts to that; it will\nprobably continue even if it's merely a fancy, and we must seem to know\nit; whatever comes of it, we can't disown it.  They are very simple,\nunfashionable people, and unworldly; but I can't say that they are\noffensive, unless--unless,\" she added, in propitiation of her husband's\nsmile, \"unless the father--how did you find the father?\" she implored.\n\n\"He will be very entertaining,\" said Corey, \"if you start him on his\npaint.  What was the disagreeable daughter like? Shall you have her?\"\n\n\"She's little and dark.  We must have them all,\" Mrs. Corey sighed.\n\"Then you don't think a dinner would do?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I do.  As you say, we can't disown Tom's relation to them,\nwhatever it is.  We had much better recognise it, and make the best of\nthe inevitable.  I think a Lapham dinner would be delightful.\" He\nlooked at her with delicate irony in his voice and smile, and she\nfetched another sigh, so deep and sore now that he laughed outright.\n\"Perhaps,\" he suggested, \"it would be the best way of curing Tom of his\nfancy, if he has one.  He has been seeing her with the dangerous\nadvantages which a mother knows how to give her daughter in the family\ncircle, and with no means of comparing her with other girls.  You must\ninvite several other very pretty girls.\"\n\n\"Do you really think so, Bromfield?\" asked Mrs. Corey, taking courage a\nlittle.  \"That might do,\" But her spirits visibly sank again.  \"I don't\nknow any other girl half so pretty.\"\n\n\"Well, then, better bred.\"\n\n\"She is very lady-like, very modest, and pleasing.\"\n\n\"Well, more cultivated.\"\n\n\"Tom doesn't get on with such people.\"\n\n\"Oh, you wish him to marry her, I see.\"\n\n\"No, no.\"\n\n\"Then you'd better give the dinner to bring them together, to promote\nthe affair.\"\n\n\"You know I don't want to do that, Bromfield.  But I feel that we must\ndo something.  If we don't, it has a clandestine appearance.  It isn't\njust to them.  A dinner won't leave us in any worse position, and may\nleave us in a better.  Yes,\" said Mrs. Corey, after another thoughtful\ninterval, \"we must have them--have them all.  It could be very simple.\"\n\n\"Ah, you can't give a dinner under a bushel, if I take your meaning, my\ndear.  If we do this at all, we mustn't do it as if we were ashamed of\nit.  We must ask people to meet them.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" sighed Mrs. Corey.  \"There are not many people in town yet,\" she\nadded, with relief that caused her husband another smile.  \"There\nreally seems a sort of fatality about it,\" she concluded religiously.\n\n\"Then you had better not struggle against it.  Go and reconcile Lily\nand Nanny to it as soon as possible.\"\n\nMrs. Corey blanched a little.  \"But don't you think it will be the best\nthing, Bromfield?\"\n\n\"I do indeed, my dear.  The only thing that shakes my faith in the\nscheme is the fact that I first suggested it.  But if you have adopted\nit, it must be all right, Anna.  I can't say that I expected it.\"\n\n\"No,\" said his wife, \"it wouldn't do.\"\n\n\n\nXIII.\n\n\nHAVING distinctly given up the project of asking the Laphams to dinner,\nMrs. Corey was able to carry it out with the courage of sinners who\nhave sacrificed to virtue by frankly acknowledging its superiority to\ntheir intended transgression.  She did not question but the Laphams\nwould come; and she only doubted as to the people whom she should\ninvite to meet them.  She opened the matter with some trepidation to\nher daughters, but neither of them opposed her; they rather looked at\nthe scheme from her own point of view, and agreed with her that nothing\nhad really yet been done to wipe out the obligation to the Laphams\nhelplessly contracted the summer before, and strengthened by that\nill-advised application to Mrs. Lapham for charity.  Not only the\nprincipal of their debt of gratitude remained, but the accruing\ninterest.  They said, What harm could giving the dinner possibly do\nthem? They might ask any or all of their acquaintance without\ndisadvantage to themselves; but it would be perfectly easy to give the\ndinner just the character they chose, and still flatter the ignorance\nof the Laphams.  The trouble would be with Tom, if he were really\ninterested in the girl; but he could not say anything if they made it a\nfamily dinner; he could not feel anything.  They had each turned in her\nown mind, as it appeared from a comparison of ideas, to one of the most\ncomprehensive of those cousinships which form the admiration and terror\nof the adventurer in Boston society.  He finds himself hemmed in and\nleft out at every turn by ramifications that forbid him all hope of\nsafe personality in his comments on people; he is never less secure\nthan when he hears some given Bostonian denouncing or ridiculing\nanother.  If he will be advised, he will guard himself from concurring\nin these criticisms, however just they appear, for the probability is\nthat their object is a cousin of not more than one remove from the\ncensor.  When the alien hears a group of Boston ladies calling one\nanother, and speaking of all their gentlemen friends, by the familiar\nabbreviations of their Christian names, he must feel keenly the exile\nto which he was born; but he is then, at least, in comparatively little\ndanger; while these latent and tacit cousinships open pitfalls at every\nstep around him, in a society where Middlesexes have married Essexes\nand produced Suffolks for two hundred and fifty years.\n\nThese conditions, however, so perilous to the foreigner, are a source\nof strength and security to those native to them.  An uncertain\nacquaintance may be so effectually involved in the meshes of such a\ncousinship, as never to be heard of outside of it and tremendous\nstories are told of people who have spent a whole winter in Boston, in\na whirl of gaiety, and who, the original guests of the Suffolks,\ndiscover upon reflection that they have met no one but Essexes and\nMiddlesexes.\n\nMrs. Corey's brother James came first into her mind, and she thought\nwith uncommon toleration of the easy-going, uncritical, good-nature of\nhis wife.  James Bellingham had been the adviser of her son throughout,\nand might be said to have actively promoted his connection with Lapham.\nShe thought next of the widow of her cousin, Henry Bellingham, who had\nlet her daughter marry that Western steamboat man, and was fond of her\nson-in-law; she might be expected at least to endure the paint-king and\nhis family.  The daughters insisted so strongly upon Mrs. Bellingham's\nson Charles, that Mrs. Corey put him down--if he were in town; he might\nbe in Central America; he got on with all sorts of people.  It seemed\nto her that she might stop at this: four Laphams, five Coreys, and four\nBellinghams were enough.\n\n\"That makes thirteen,\" said Nanny.  \"You can have Mr. and Mrs. Sewell.\"\n\n\"Yes, that is a good idea,\" assented Mrs. Corey.  \"He is our minister,\nand it is very proper.\"\n\n\"I don't see why you don't have Robert Chase.  It is a pity he\nshouldn't see her--for the colour.\"\n\n\"I don't quite like the idea of that,\" said Mrs. Corey; \"but we can\nhave him too, if it won't make too many.\" The painter had married into\na poorer branch of the Coreys, and his wife was dead.  \"Is there any\none else?\"\n\n\"There is Miss Kingsbury.\"\n\n\"We have had her so much.  She will begin to think we are using her.\"\n\n\"She won't mind; she's so good-natured.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" the mother summed up, \"there are four Laphams, five\nCoreys, four Bellinghams, one Chase, and one Kingsbury--fifteen. Oh!\nand two Sewells.  Seventeen.  Ten ladies and seven gentlemen.  It\ndoesn't balance very well, and it's too large.\"\n\n\"Perhaps some of the ladies won't come,\" suggested Lily.\n\n\"Oh, the ladies always come,\" said Nanny.\n\nTheir mother reflected.  \"Well, I will ask them.  The ladies will\nrefuse in time to let us pick up some gentlemen somewhere; some more\nartists.  Why! we must have Mr. Seymour, the architect; he's a\nbachelor, and he's building their house, Tom says.\"\n\nHer voice fell a little when she mentioned her son's name, and she told\nhim of her plan, when he came home in the evening, with evident\nmisgiving.\n\n\"What are you doing it for, mother?\" he asked, looking at her with his\nhonest eyes.\n\nShe dropped her own in a little confusion.  \"I won't do it at all, my\ndear,\" she said, \"if you don't approve.  But I thought--You know we\nhave never made any proper acknowledgment of their kindness to us at\nBaie St. Paul.  Then in the winter, I'm ashamed to say, I got money\nfrom her for a charity I was interested in; and I hate the idea of\nmerely USING people in that way.  And now your having been at their\nhouse this summer--we can't seem to disapprove of that; and your\nbusiness relations to him----\"\n\n\"Yes, I see,\" said Corey.  \"Do you think it amounts to a dinner?\"\n\n\"Why, I don't know,\" returned his mother.  \"We shall have hardly any\none out of our family connection.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Corey assented, \"it might do.  I suppose what you wish is to\ngive them a pleasure.\"\n\n\"Why, certainly.  Don't you think they'd like to come?\"\n\n\"Oh, they'd like to come; but whether it would be a pleasure after they\nwere here is another thing.  I should have said that if you wanted to\nhave them, they would enjoy better being simply asked to meet our own\nimmediate family.\"\n\n\"That's what I thought of in the first place, but your father seemed to\nthink it implied a social distrust of them; and we couldn't afford to\nhave that appearance, even to ourselves.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he was right.\"\n\n\"And besides, it might seem a little significant.\"\n\nCorey seemed inattentive to this consideration.  \"Whom did you think of\nasking?\" His mother repeated the names.  \"Yes, that would do,\" he said,\nwith a vague dissatisfaction.\n\n\"I won't have it at all, if you don't wish, Tom.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, have it; perhaps you ought.  Yes, I dare say it's right.  What\ndid you mean by a family dinner seeming significant?\"\n\nHis mother hesitated.  When it came to that, she did not like to\nrecognise in his presence the anxieties that had troubled her.  But \"I\ndon't know,\" she said, since she must.  \"I shouldn't want to give that\nyoung girl, or her mother, the idea that we wished to make more of the\nacquaintance than--than you did, Tom.\"\n\nHe looked at her absent-mindedly, as if he did not take her meaning.\nBut he said, \"Oh yes, of course,\" and Mrs. Corey, in the uncertainty in\nwhich she seemed destined to remain concerning this affair, went off\nand wrote her invitation to Mrs. Lapham.  Later in the evening, when\nthey again found themselves alone, her son said, \"I don't think I\nunderstood you, mother, in regard to the Laphams.  I think I do now.  I\ncertainly don't wish you to make more of the acquaintance than I have\ndone.  It wouldn't be right; it might be very unfortunate.  Don't give\nthe dinner!\"\n\n\"It's too late now, my son,\" said Mrs. Corey.  \"I sent my note to Mrs.\nLapham an hour ago.\" Her courage rose at the trouble which showed in\nCorey's face.  \"But don't be annoyed by it, Tom.  It isn't a family\ndinner, you know, and everything can be managed without embarrassment.\nIf we take up the affair at this point, you will seem to have been\nmerely acting for us; and they can't possibly understand anything more.\"\n\n\"Well, well! Let it go! I dare say it's all right. At any rate, it can't\nbe helped now.\"\n\n\"I don't wish to help it, Tom,\" said Mrs. Corey, with a cheerfullness\nwhich the thought of the Laphams had never brought her before.  \"I am\nsure it is quite fit and proper, and we can make them have a very\npleasant time.  They are good, inoffensive people, and we owe it to\nourselves not to be afraid to show that we have felt their kindness to\nus, and his appreciation of you.\"\n\n\"Well,\" consented Corey.  The trouble that his mother had suddenly cast\noff was in his tone; but she was not sorry.  It was quite time that he\nshould think seriously of his attitude toward these people if he had\nnot thought of it before, but, according to his father's theory, had\nbeen merely dangling.\n\nIt was a view of her son's character that could hardly have pleased her\nin different circumstances, yet it was now unquestionably a consolation\nif not wholly a pleasure.  If she considered the Laphams at all, it was\nwith the resignation which we feel at the evils of others, even when\nthey have not brought them on themselves.\n\nMrs. Lapham, for her part, had spent the hours between Mrs. Corey's\nvisit and her husband's coming home from business in reaching the same\nconclusion with regard to Corey; and her spirits were at the lowest\nwhen they sat down to supper.  Irene was downcast with her; Penelope\nwas purposely gay; and the Colonel was beginning, after his first plate\nof the boiled ham,--which, bristling with cloves, rounded its bulk on a\nwide platter before him,--to take note of the surrounding mood, when\nthe door-bell jingled peremptorily, and the girl left waiting on the\ntable to go and answer it.  She returned at once with a note for Mrs.\nLapham, which she read, and then, after a helpless survey of her\nfamily, read again.\n\n\"Why, what IS it, mamma?\" asked Irene, while the Colonel, who had taken\nup his carving-knife for another attack on the ham, held it drawn half\nacross it.\n\n\"Why, I don't know what it does mean,\" answered Mrs. Lapham\ntremulously, and she let the girl take the note from her.\n\nIrene ran it over, and then turned to the name at the end with a joyful\ncry and a flush that burned to the top of her forehead.  Then she began\nto read it once more.\n\nThe Colonel dropped his knife and frowned impatiently, and Mrs. Lapham\nsaid, \"You read it out loud, if you know what to make of it, Irene.\"\nBut Irene, with a nervous scream of protest, handed it to her father,\nwho performed the office.\n\n\"DEAR MRS.  LAPHAM:\n\n\"Will you and General Lapham----\"\n\n\"I didn't know I was a general,\" grumbled Lapham.  \"I guess I shall\nhave to be looking up my back pay.  Who is it writes this, anyway?\" he\nasked, turning the letter over for the signature.\n\n\"Oh, never mind.  Read it through!\" cried his wife, with a kindling\nglance of triumph at Penelope, and he resumed--\n\n\"--and your daughters give us the pleasure of your company at dinner on\nThursday, the 28th, at half-past six.\n\n\"Yours sincerely,\n\n\"ANNA B. COREY.\"\n\nThe brief invitation had been spread over two pages, and the Colonel\nhad difficulties with the signature which he did not instantly\nsurmount.  When he had made out the name and pronounced it, he looked\nacross at his wife for an explanation.\n\n\"I don't know what it all means,\" she said, shaking her head and\nspeaking with a pleased flutter.  \"She was here this afternoon, and I\nshould have said she had come to see how bad she could make us feel.  I\ndeclare I never felt so put down in my life by anybody.\"\n\n\"Why, what did she do? What did she say?\" Lapham was ready, in his\ndense pride, to resent any affront to his blood, but doubtful, with the\nevidence of this invitation to the contrary, if any affront had been\noffered.  Mrs. Lapham tried to tell him, but there was really nothing\ntangible; and when she came to put it into words, she could not make\nout a case.  Her husband listened to her excited attempt, and then he\nsaid, with judicial superiority, \"I guess nobody's been trying to make\nyou feel bad, Persis.  What would she go right home and invite you to\ndinner for, if she'd acted the way you say?\"\n\nIn this view it did seem improbable, and Mrs. Lapham was shaken.  She\ncould only say, \"Penelope felt just the way I did about it.\"\n\nLapham looked at the girl, who said, \"Oh, I can't prove it! I begin to\nthink it never happened.  I guess it didn't.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" said her father, and he sat frowning thoughtfully a\nwhile--ignoring her mocking irony, or choosing to take her seriously.\n\"You can't really put your finger on anything,\" he said to his wife,\n\"and it ain't likely there is anything.  Anyway, she's done the proper\nthing by you now.\"\n\nMrs. Lapham faltered between her lingering resentment and the appeals\nof her flattered vanity.  She looked from Penelope's impassive face to\nthe eager eyes of Irene.  \"Well--just as you say, Silas.  I don't know\nas she WAS so very bad.  I guess may be she was embarrassed some----\"\n\n\"That's what I told you, mamma, from the start,\" interrupted Irene.\n\"Didn't I tell you she didn't mean anything by it? It's just the way\nshe acted at Baie St. Paul, when she got well enough to realise what\nyou'd done for her!\"\n\nPenelope broke into a laugh.  \"Is that her way of showing her\ngratitude? I'm sorry I didn't understand that before.\"\n\nIrene made no effort to reply.  She merely looked from her mother to\nher father with a grieved face for their protection, and Lapham said,\n\"When we've done supper, you answer her, Persis.  Say we'll come.\"\n\n\"With one exception,\" said Penelope.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" demanded her father, with a mouth full of ham.\n\"Oh, nothing of importance.  Merely that I'm not going.\"\n\nLapham gave himself time to swallow his morsel, and his rising wrath\nwent down with it.  \"I guess you'll change your mind when the time\ncomes,\" he said.  \"Anyway, Persis, you say we'll all come, and then, if\nPenelope don't want to go, you can excuse her after we get there.\nThat's the best way.\"\n\nNone of them, apparently, saw any reason why the affair should not be\nleft in this way, or had a sense of the awful and binding nature of a\ndinner engagement.  If she believed that Penelope would not finally\nchange her mind and go, no doubt Mrs. Lapham thought that Mrs. Corey\nwould easily excuse her absence.  She did not find it so simple a\nmatter to accept the invitation.  Mrs. Corey had said \"Dear Mrs.\nLapham,\" but Mrs. Lapham had her doubts whether it would not be a\nservile imitation to say \"Dear Mrs. Corey\" in return; and she was\ntormented as to the proper phrasing throughout and the precise\ntemperature which she should impart to her politeness.  She wrote an\nunpractised, uncharacteristic round hand, the same in which she used to\nset the children's copies at school, and she subscribed herself, after\nsome hesitation between her husband's given name and her own, \"Yours\ntruly, Mrs. S. Lapham.\"\n\nPenelope had gone to her room, without waiting to be asked to advise or\ncriticise; but Irene had decided upon the paper, and on the whole, Mrs.\nLapham's note made a very decent appearance on the page.\n\nWhen the furnace-man came, the Colonel sent him out to post it in the\nbox at the corner of the square.  He had determined not to say anything\nmore about the matter before the girls, not choosing to let them see\nthat he was elated; he tried to give the effect of its being an\neveryday sort of thing, abruptly closing the discussion with his order\nto Mrs. Lapham to accept; but he had remained swelling behind his\nnewspaper during her prolonged struggle with her note, and he could no\nlonger hide his elation when Irene followed her sister upstairs.\n\n\"Well, Pers,\" he demanded, \"what do you say now?\"\n\nMrs. Lapham had been sobered into something of her former misgiving by\nher difficulties with her note.  \"Well, I don't know what TO say.  I\ndeclare, I'm all mixed up about it, and I don't know as we've begun as\nwe can carry out in promising to go.  I presume,\" she sighed, \"that we\ncan all send some excuse at the last moment, if we don't want to go.\"\n\n\"I guess we can carry out, and I guess we shan't want to send any\nexcuse,\" bragged the Colonel.  \"If we're ever going to be anybody at\nall, we've got to go and see how it's done.  I presume we've got to\ngive some sort of party when we get into the new house, and this gives\nthe chance to ask 'em back again.  You can't complain now but what\nthey've made the advances, Persis?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Mrs. Lapham lifelessly; \"I wonder why they wanted to do it.\nOh, I suppose it's all right,\" she added in deprecation of the anger\nwith her humility which she saw rising in her husband's face; \"but if\nit's all going to be as much trouble as that letter, I'd rather be\nwhipped.  I don't know what I'm going to wear; or the girls either.  I\ndo wonder--I've heard that people go to dinner in low-necks. Do you\nsuppose it's the custom?\"\n\n\"How should I know?\" demanded the Colonel.  \"I guess you've got clothes\nenough.  Any rate, you needn't fret about it.  You just go round to\nWhite's or Jordan & Marsh's, and ask for a dinner dress.  I guess\nthat'll settle it; they'll know.  Get some of them imported dresses.  I\nsee 'em in the window every time I pass; lots of 'em.\"\n\n\"Oh, it ain't the dress!\" said Mrs. Lapham.  \"I don't suppose but what\nwe could get along with that; and I want to do the best we can for the\nchildren; but I don't know what we're going to talk about to those\npeople when we get there.  We haven't got anything in common with them.\nOh, I don't say they're any better,\" she again made haste to say in\narrest of her husband's resentment.  \"I don't believe they are; and I\ndon't see why they should be.  And there ain't anybody has got a better\nright to hold up their head than you have, Silas.  You've got plenty of\nmoney, and you've made every cent of it.\"\n\n\"I guess I shouldn't amounted to much without you, Persis,\" interposed\nLapham, moved to this justice by her praise.\n\n\"Oh, don't talk about ME!\" protested the wife.  \"Now that you've made\nit all right about Rogers, there ain't a thing in this world against\nyou.  But still, for all that, I can see--and I can feel it when I\ncan't see it--that we're different from those people.  They're\nwell-meaning enough, and they'd excuse it, I presume, but we're too old\nto learn to be like them.\"\n\n\"The children ain't,\" said Lapham shrewdly.\n\n\"No, the children ain't,\" admitted his wife, \"and that's the only thing\nthat reconciles me to it.\"\n\n\"You see how pleased Irene looked when I read it?\"\n\n\"Yes, she was pleased.\"\n\n\"And I guess Penelope'll think better of it before the time comes.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, we do it for them.  But whether we're doing the best thing for\n'em, goodness knows.  I'm not saying anything against HIM.  Irene'll be\na lucky girl to get him, if she wants him.  But there! I'd ten times\nrather she was going to marry such a fellow as you were, Si, that had\nto make every inch of his own way, and she had to help him.  It's in\nher!\"\n\nLapham laughed aloud for pleasure in his wife's fondness; but neither\nof them wished that he should respond directly to it.  \"I guess, if it\nwa'n't for me, he wouldn't have a much easier time.  But don't you\nfret! It's all coming out right.  That dinner ain't a thing for you to\nbe uneasy about.  It'll pass off perfectly easy and natural.\"\n\nLapham did not keep his courageous mind quite to the end of the week\nthat followed.  It was his theory not to let Corey see that he was set\nup about the invitation, and when the young man said politely that his\nmother was glad they were able to come, Lapham was very short with him.\nHe said yes, he believed that Mrs. Lapham and the girls were going.\nAfterward he was afraid Corey might not understand that he was coming\ntoo; but he did not know how to approach the subject again, and Corey\ndid not, so he let it pass.  It worried him to see all the preparation\nthat his wife and Irene were making, and he tried to laugh at them for\nit; and it worried him to find that Penelope was making no preparation\nat all for herself, but only helping the others.  He asked her what\nshould she do if she changed her mind at the last moment and concluded\nto go, and she said she guessed she should not change her mind, but if\nshe did, she would go to White's with him and get him to choose her an\nimported dress, he seemed to like them so much.  He was too proud to\nmention the subject again to her.\n\nFinally, all that dress-making in the house began to scare him with\nvague apprehensions in regard to his own dress.  As soon as he had\ndetermined to go, an ideal of the figure in which he should go\npresented itself to his mind.  He should not wear any dress-coat,\nbecause, for one thing, he considered that a man looked like a fool in\na dress-coat, and, for another thing, he had none--had none on\nprinciple.  He would go in a frock-coat and black pantaloons, and\nperhaps a white waistcoat, but a black cravat anyway.  But as soon as\nhe developed this ideal to his family, which he did in pompous disdain\nof their anxieties about their own dress, they said he should not go\nso.  Irene reminded him that he was the only person without a\ndress-coat at a corps reunion dinner which he had taken her to some\nyears before, and she remembered feeling awfully about it at the time.\nMrs. Lapham, who would perhaps have agreed of herself, shook her head\nwith misgiving.  \"I don't see but what you'll have to get you one, Si,\"\nshe said.  \"I don't believe they ever go without 'em to a private\nhouse.\"\n\nHe held out openly, but on his way home the next day, in a sudden\npanic, he cast anchor before his tailor's door and got measured for a\ndress-coat. After that he began to be afflicted about his waist-coat,\nconcerning which he had hitherto been airily indifferent.  He tried to\nget opinion out of his family, but they were not so clear about it as\nthey were about the frock.  It ended in their buying a book of\netiquette, which settled the question adversely to a white waistcoat.\nThe author, however, after being very explicit in telling them not to\neat with their knives, and above all not to pick their teeth with their\nforks,--a thing which he said no lady or gentleman ever did,--was still\nfar from decided as to the kind of cravat Colonel Lapham ought to wear:\nshaken on other points, Lapham had begun to waver also concerning the\nblack cravat.  As to the question of gloves for the Colonel, which\nsuddenly flashed upon him one evening, it appeared never to have\nentered the thoughts of the etiquette man, as Lapham called him.  Other\nauthors on the same subject were equally silent, and Irene could only\nremember having heard, in some vague sort of way, that gentlemen did\nnot wear gloves so much any more.\n\nDrops of perspiration gathered on Lapham's forehead in the anxiety of\nthe debate; he groaned, and he swore a little in the compromise\nprofanity which he used.\n\n\"I declare,\" said Penelope, where she sat purblindly sewing on a bit of\ndress for Irene, \"the Colonel's clothes are as much trouble as\nanybody's. Why don't you go to Jordan & Marsh's and order one of the\nimported dresses for yourself, father?\" That gave them all the relief\nof a laugh over it, the Colonel joining in piteously.\n\nHe had an awful longing to find out from Corey how he ought to go.  He\nformulated and repeated over to himself an apparently careless\nquestion, such as, \"Oh, by the way, Corey, where do you get your\ngloves?\" This would naturally lead to some talk on the subject, which\nwould, if properly managed, clear up the whole trouble.  But Lapham\nfound that he would rather die than ask this question, or any question\nthat would bring up the dinner again.  Corey did not recur to it, and\nLapham avoided the matter with positive fierceness.  He shunned talking\nwith Corey at all, and suffered in grim silence.\n\nOne night, before they fell asleep, his wife said to him, \"I was\nreading in one of those books to-day, and I don't believe but what\nwe've made a mistake if Pen holds out that she won't go.\"\n\n\"Why?\" demanded Lapham, in the dismay which beset him at every fresh\nrecurrence to the subject.\n\n\"The book says that it's very impolite not to answer a dinner\ninvitation promptly.  Well, we've done that all right,--at first I\ndidn't know but what we had been a little too quick, may be,--but then\nit says if you're not going, that it's the height of rudeness not to\nlet them know at once, so that they can fill your place at the table.\"\n\nThe Colonel was silent for a while.  \"Well, I'm dumned,\" he said\nfinally, \"if there seems to be any end to this thing.  If it was to do\nover again, I'd say no for all of us.\"\n\n\"I've wished a hundred times they hadn't asked us; but it's too late to\nthink about that now.  The question is, what are we going to do about\nPenelope?\"\n\n\"Oh, I guess she'll go, at the last moment.\"\n\n\"She says she won't. She took a prejudice against Mrs. Corey that day,\nand she can't seem to get over it.\"\n\n\"Well, then, hadn't you better write in the morning, as soon as you're\nup, that she ain't coming?\"\n\nMrs. Lapham sighed helplessly.  \"I shouldn't know how to get it in.\nIt's so late now; I don't see how I could have the face.\"\n\n\"Well, then, she's got to go, that's all.\"\n\n\"She's set she won't.\"\n\n\"And I'm set she shall,\" said Lapham with the loud obstinacy of a man\nwhose women always have their way.\n\nMrs. Lapham was not supported by the sturdiness of his proclamation.\n\nBut she did not know how to do what she knew she ought to do about\nPenelope, and she let matters drift.  After all, the child had a right\nto stay at home if she did not wish to go.  That was what Mrs. Lapham\nfelt, and what she said to her husband next morning, bidding him let\nPenelope alone, unless she chose herself to go.  She said it was too\nlate now to do anything, and she must make the best excuse she could\nwhen she saw Mrs. Corey.  She began to wish that Irene and her father\nwould go and excuse her too.  She could not help saying this, and then\nshe and Lapham had some unpleasant words.\n\n\"Look here!\" he cried.  \"Who wanted to go in for these people in the\nfirst place? Didn't you come home full of 'em last year, and want me to\nsell out here and move somewheres else because it didn't seem to suit\n'em? And now you want to put it all on me! I ain't going to stand it.\"\n\n\"Hush!\" said his wife.  \"Do you want to raise the house? I didn't put\nit on you, as you say.  You took it on yourself.  Ever since that\nfellow happened to come into the new house that day, you've been\nperfectly crazy to get in with them.  And now you're so afraid you\nshall do something wrong before 'em, you don't hardly dare to say your\nlife's your own.  I declare, if you pester me any more about those\ngloves, Silas Lapham, I won't go.\"\n\n\"Do you suppose I want to go on my own account?\" he demanded furiously.\n\n\"No,\" she admitted.  \"Of course I don't. I know very well that you're\ndoing it for Irene; but, for goodness gracious' sake, don't worry our\nlives out, and make yourself a perfect laughing-stock before the\nchildren.\"\n\nWith this modified concession from her, the quarrel closed in sullen\nsilence on Lapham's part.  The night before the dinner came, and the\nquestion of his gloves was still unsettled, and in a fair way to remain\nso.  He had bought a pair, so as to be on the safe side, perspiring in\ncompany with the young lady who sold them, and who helped him try them\non at the shop; his nails were still full of the powder which she had\nplentifully peppered into them in order to overcome the resistance of\nhis blunt fingers.  But he was uncertain whether he should wear them.\nThey had found a book at last that said the ladies removed their gloves\non sitting down at table, but it said nothing about gentlemen's gloves.\nHe left his wife where she stood half hook-and-eyed at her glass in her\nnew dress, and went down to his own den beyond the parlour.  Before he\nshut his door he caught a glimpse of Irene trailing up and down before\nthe long mirror in HER new dress, followed by the seamstress on her\nknees; the woman had her mouth full of pins, and from time to time she\nmade Irene stop till she could put one of the pins into her train;\nPenelope sat in a corner criticising and counselling.  It made Lapham\nsick, and he despised himself and all his brood for the trouble they\nwere taking.  But another glance gave him a sight of the young girl's\nface in the mirror, beautiful and radiant with happiness, and his heart\nmelted again with paternal tenderness and pride.  It was going to be a\ngreat pleasure to Irene, and Lapham felt that she was bound to cut out\nanything there.  He was vexed with Penelope that she was not going too;\nhe would have liked to have those people hear her talk.  He held his\ndoor a little open, and listened to the things she was \"getting off\"\nthere to Irene.  He showed that he felt really hurt and disappointed\nabout Penelope, and the girl's mother made her console him the next\nevening before they all drove away without her.  \"You try to look on\nthe bright side of it, father.  I guess you'll see that it's best I\ndidn't go when you get there.  Irene needn't open her lips, and they\ncan all see how pretty she is; but they wouldn't know how smart I was\nunless I talked, and maybe then they wouldn't.\"\n\nThis thrust at her father's simple vanity in her made him laugh; and\nthen they drove away, and Penelope shut the door, and went upstairs\nwith her lips firmly shutting in a sob.\n\n\n\nXIV.\n\n\nTHE Coreys were one of the few old families who lingered in Bellingham\nPlace, the handsome, quiet old street which the sympathetic observer\nmust grieve to see abandoned to boarding-houses. The dwellings are\nstately and tall, and the whole place wears an air of aristocratic\nseclusion, which Mrs. Corey's father might well have thought assured\nwhen he left her his house there at his death.  It is one of two\nevidently designed by the same architect who built some houses in a\ncharacteristic taste on Beacon Street opposite the Common.  It has a\nwooden portico, with slender fluted columns, which have always been\npainted white, and which, with the delicate mouldings of the cornice,\nform the sole and sufficient decoration of the street front; nothing\ncould be simpler, and nothing could be better.  Within, the architect\nhas again indulged his preference for the classic; the roof of the\nvestibule, wide and low, rests on marble columns, slim and fluted like\nthe wooden columns without, and an ample staircase climbs in a\ngraceful, easy curve from the tesselated pavement.  Some carved\nVenetian scrigni stretched along the wall; a rug lay at the foot of the\nstairs; but otherwise the simple adequacy of the architectural\nintention had been respected, and the place looked bare to the eyes of\nthe Laphams when they entered.  The Coreys had once kept a man, but\nwhen young Corey began his retrenchments the man had yielded to the\nneat maid who showed the Colonel into the reception-room and asked the\nladies to walk up two flights.\n\nHe had his charges from Irene not to enter the drawing-room without her\nmother, and he spent five minutes in getting on his gloves, for he had\ndesperately resolved to wear them at last.  When he had them on, and\nlet his large fists hang down on either side, they looked, in the\nsaffron tint which the shop-girl said his gloves should be of, like\ncanvased hams.  He perspired with doubt as he climbed the stairs, and\nwhile he waited on the landing for Mrs. Lapham and Irene to come down\nfrom above before going into the drawing-room, he stood staring at his\nhands, now open and now shut, and breathing hard.  He heard quiet\ntalking beyond the portiere within, and presently Tom Corey came out.\n\n\"Ah, Colonel Lapham! Very glad to see you.\"\n\nLapham shook hands with him and gasped, \"Waiting for Mis' Lapham,\" to\naccount for his presence.  He had not been able to button his right\nglove, and he now began, with as much indifference as he could assume,\nto pull them both off, for he saw that Corey wore none.  By the time he\nhad stuffed them into the pocket of his coat-skirt his wife and\ndaughter descended.\n\nCorey welcomed them very cordially too, but looked a little mystified.\nMrs. Lapham knew that he was silently inquiring for Penelope, and she\ndid not know whether she ought to excuse her to him first or not.  She\nsaid nothing, and after a glance toward the regions where Penelope\nmight conjecturably be lingering, he held aside the portiere for the\nLaphams to pass, and entered the room with them.\n\nMrs. Lapham had decided against low-necks on her own responsibility,\nand had entrenched herself in the safety of a black silk, in which she\nlooked very handsome.  Irene wore a dress of one of those shades which\nonly a woman or an artist can decide to be green or blue, and which to\nother eyes looks both or neither, according to their degrees of\nignorance.  If it was more like a ball dress than a dinner dress, that\nmight be excused to the exquisite effect.  She trailed, a delicate\nsplendour, across the carpet in her mother's sombre wake, and the\nconsciousness of success brought a vivid smile to her face.  Lapham,\npallid with anxiety lest he should somehow disgrace himself, giving\nthanks to God that he should have been spared the shame of wearing\ngloves where no one else did, but at the same time despairing that\nCorey should have seen him in them, had an unwonted aspect of almost\npathetic refinement.\n\nMrs. Corey exchanged a quick glance of surprise and relief with her\nhusband as she started across the room to meet her guests, and in her\ngratitude to them for being so irreproachable, she threw into her\nmanner a warmth that people did not always find there.  \"General\nLapham?\" she said, shaking hands in quick succession with Mrs. Lapham\nand Irene, and now addressing herself to him.\n\n\"No, ma'am, only Colonel,\" said the honest man, but the lady did not\nhear him.  She was introducing her husband to Lapham's wife and\ndaughter, and Bromfield Corey was already shaking his hand and saying\nhe was very glad to see him again, while he kept his artistic eye on\nIrene, and apparently could not take it off.  Lily Corey gave the\nLapham ladies a greeting which was physically rather than socially\ncold, and Nanny stood holding Irene's hand in both of hers a moment,\nand taking in her beauty and her style with a generous admiration which\nshe could afford, for she was herself faultlessly dressed in the quiet\ntaste of her city, and looking very pretty.  The interval was long\nenough to let every man present confide his sense of Irene's beauty to\nevery other; and then, as the party was small, Mrs. Corey made\neverybody acquainted.  When Lapham had not quite understood, he held\nthe person's hand, and, leaning urbanely forward, inquired, \"What\nname?\" He did that because a great man to whom he had been presented on\nthe platform at a public meeting had done so to him, and he knew it\nmust be right.\n\nA little lull ensued upon the introductions, and Mrs. Corey said\nquietly to Mrs. Lapham, \"Can I send any one to be of use to Miss\nLapham?\" as if Penelope must be in the dressing-room.\n\nMrs. Lapham turned fire-red, and the graceful forms in which she had\nbeen intending to excuse her daughter's absence went out of her head.\n\"She isn't upstairs,\" she said, at her bluntest, as country people are\nwhen embarrassed.  \"She didn't feel just like coming to-night.  I don't\nknow as she's feeling very well.\"\n\nMrs. Corey emitted a very small \"O!\"--very small, very cold,--which\nbegan to grow larger and hotter and to burn into Mrs. Lapham's soul\nbefore Mrs. Corey could add, \"I'm very sorry.  It's nothing serious, I\nhope?\"\n\nRobert Chase, the painter, had not come, and Mrs. James Bellingham was\nnot there, so that the table really balanced better without Penelope;\nbut Mrs. Lapham could not know this, and did not deserve to know it.\nMrs. Corey glanced round the room, as if to take account of her guests,\nand said to her husband, \"I think we are all here, then,\" and he came\nforward and gave his arm to Mrs. Lapham.  She perceived then that in\ntheir determination not to be the first to come they had been the last,\nand must have kept the others waiting for them.\n\nLapham had never seen people go down to dinner arm-in-arm before, but\nhe knew that his wife was distinguished in being taken out by the host,\nand he waited in jealous impatience to see if Tom Corey would offer his\narm to Irene.  He gave it to that big girl they called Miss Kingsbury,\nand the handsome old fellow whom Mrs. Corey had introduced as her\ncousin took Irene out.  Lapham was startled from the misgiving in which\nthis left him by Mrs. Corey's passing her hand through his arm, and he\nmade a sudden movement forward, but felt himself gently restrained.\nThey went out the last of all; he did not know why, but he submitted,\nand when they sat down he saw that Irene, although she had come in with\nthat Mr. Bellingham, was seated beside young Corey, after all.\n\nHe fetched a long sigh of relief when he sank into his chair and felt\nhimself safe from error if he kept a sharp lookout and did only what\nthe others did.  Bellingham had certain habits which he permitted\nhimself, and one of these was tucking the corner of his napkin into his\ncollar; he confessed himself an uncertain shot with a spoon, and\ndefended his practice on the ground of neatness and common-sense.\nLapham put his napkin into his collar too, and then, seeing that no one\nbut Bellingham did it, became alarmed and took it out again slyly.  He\nnever had wine on his table at home, and on principle he was a\nprohibitionist; but now he did not know just what to do about the\nglasses at the right of his plate.  He had a notion to turn them all\ndown, as he had read of a well-known politician's doing at a public\ndinner, to show that he did not take wine; but, after twiddling with\none of them a moment, he let them be, for it seemed to him that would\nbe a little too conspicuous, and he felt that every one was looking.\nHe let the servant fill them all, and he drank out of each, not to\nappear odd.  Later, he observed that the young ladies were not taking\nwine, and he was glad to see that Irene had refused it, and that Mrs.\nLapham was letting it stand untasted.  He did not know but he ought to\ndecline some of the dishes, or at least leave most of some on his\nplate, but he was not able to decide; he took everything and ate\neverything.\n\nHe noticed that Mrs. Corey seemed to take no more trouble about the\ndinner than anybody, and Mr. Corey rather less; he was talking busily\nto Mrs. Lapham, and Lapham caught a word here and there that convinced\nhim she was holding her own.  He was getting on famously himself with\nMrs. Corey, who had begun with him about his new house; he was telling\nher all about it, and giving her his ideas.  Their conversation\nnaturally included his architect across the table; Lapham had been\ndelighted and secretly surprised to find the fellow there; and at\nsomething Seymour said the talk spread suddenly, and the pretty house\nhe was building for Colonel Lapham became the general theme.  Young\nCorey testified to its loveliness, and the architect said laughingly\nthat if he had been able to make a nice thing of it, he owed it to the\npractical sympathy of his client.\n\n\"Practical sympathy is good,\" said Bromfield Corey; and, slanting his\nhead confidentially to Mrs. Lapham, he added, \"Does he bleed your\nhusband, Mrs. Lapham? He's a terrible fellow for appropriations!\"\n\nMrs. Lapham laughed, reddening consciously, and said she guessed the\nColonel knew how to take care of himself.  This struck Lapham, then\ndraining his glass of sauterne, as wonderfully discreet in his wife.\nBromfield Corey leaned back in his chair a moment.  \"Well, after all,\nyou can't say, with all your modern fuss about it, that you do much\nbetter now than the old fellows who built such houses as this.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said the architect, \"nobody can do better than well.  Your house\nis in perfect taste; you know I've always admired it; and I don't think\nit's at all the worse for being old-fashioned. What we've done is\nlargely to go back of the hideous style that raged after they forgot\nhow to make this sort of house.  But I think we may claim a better\nfeeling for structure.  We use better material, and more wisely; and by\nand by we shall work out something more characteristic and original.\"\n\n\"With your chocolates and olives, and your clutter of bric-a-brac?\"\n\n\"All that's bad, of course, but I don't mean that.  I don't wish to\nmake you envious of Colonel Lapham, and modesty prevents my saying,\nthat his house is prettier,--though I may have my convictions,--but\nit's better built.  All the new houses are better built.  Now, your\nhouse----\"\n\n\"Mrs. Corey's house,\" interrupted the host, with a burlesque haste in\ndisclaiming responsibility for it that made them all laugh.  \"My\nancestral halls are in Salem, and I'm told you couldn't drive a nail\ninto their timbers; in fact, I don't know that you would want to do it.\"\n\n\"I should consider it a species of sacrilege,\" answered Seymour, \"and I\nshall be far from pressing the point I was going to make against a\nhouse of Mrs. Corey's.\"\n\nThis won Seymour the easy laugh, and Lapham silently wondered that the\nfellow never got off any of those things to him.\n\n\"Well,\" said Corey, \"you architects and the musicians are the true and\nonly artistic creators.  All the rest of us, sculptors, painters,\nnovelists, and tailors, deal with forms that we have before us; we try\nto imitate, we try to represent.  But you two sorts of artists create\nform.  If you represent, you fail.  Somehow or other you do evolve the\ncamel out of your inner consciousness.\"\n\n\"I will not deny the soft impeachment,\" said the architect, with a\nmodest air.\n\n\"I dare say.  And you'll own that it's very handsome of me to say this,\nafter your unjustifiable attack on Mrs. Corey's property.\"\n\nBromfield Corey addressed himself again to Mrs. Lapham, and the talk\nsubdivided itself as before.  It lapsed so entirely away from the\nsubject just in hand, that Lapham was left with rather a good idea, as\nhe thought it, to perish in his mind, for want of a chance to express\nit.  The only thing like a recurrence to what they had been saying was\nBromfield Corey's warning Mrs. Lapham, in some connection that Lapham\nlost, against Miss Kingsbury.  \"She's worse,\" he was saying, \"when it\ncomes to appropriations than Seymour himself.  Depend upon it, Mrs.\nLapham, she will give you no peace of your mind, now she's met you,\nfrom this out.  Her tender mercies are cruel; and I leave you to supply\nthe content from your own scriptural knowledge.  Beware of her, and all\nher works.  She calls them works of charity; but heaven knows whether\nthey are.  It don't stand to reason that she gives the poor ALL the\nmoney she gets out of people.  I have my own belief\"--he gave it in a\nwhisper for the whole table to hear--\"that she spends it for champagne\nand cigars.\"\n\nLapham did not know about that kind of talking; but Miss Kingsbury\nseemed to enjoy the fun as much as anybody, and he laughed with the\nrest.\n\n\"You shall be asked to the very next debauch of the committee, Mr.\nCorey; then you won't dare expose us,\" said Miss Kingsbury.\n\n\"I wonder you haven't been down upon Corey to go to the Chardon Street\nhome and talk with your indigent Italians in their native tongue,\" said\nCharles Bellingham.  \"I saw in the Transcript the other night that you\nwanted some one for the work.\"\n\n\"We did think of Mr. Corey,\" replied Miss Kingsbury; \"but we reflected\nthat he probably wouldn't talk with them at all; he would make them\nkeep still to be sketched, and forget all about their wants.\"\n\nUpon the theory that this was a fair return for Corey's pleasantry, the\nothers laughed again.\n\n\"There is one charity,\" said Corey, pretending superiority to Miss\nKingsbury's point, \"that is so difficult, I wonder it hasn't occurred\nto a lady of your courageous invention.\"\n\n\"Yes?\" said Miss Kingsbury.  \"What is that?\"\n\n\"The occupation, by deserving poor of neat habits, of all the\nbeautiful, airy, wholesome houses that stand empty the whole summer\nlong, while their owners are away in their lowly cots beside the sea.\"\n\n\"Yes, that is terrible,\" replied Miss Kingsbury, with quick\nearnestness, while her eyes grew moist.  \"I have often thought of our\ngreat, cool houses standing useless here, and the thousands of poor\ncreatures stifling in their holes and dens, and the little children\ndying for wholesome shelter.  How cruelly selfish we are!\"\n\n\"That is a very comfortable sentiment, Miss Kingsbury,\" said Corey,\n\"and must make you feel almost as if you had thrown open No. 31 to the\nwhole North End.  But I am serious about this matter.  I spend my\nsummers in town, and I occupy my own house, so that I can speak\nimpartially and intelligently; and I tell you that in some of my walks\non the Hill and down on the Back Bay, nothing but the surveillance of\nthe local policeman prevents my offering personal violence to those\nlong rows of close-shuttered, handsome, brutally insensible houses.  If\nI were a poor man, with a sick child pining in some garret or cellar at\nthe North End, I should break into one of them, and camp out on the\ngrand piano.\"\n\n\"Surely, Bromfield,\" said his wife, \"you don't consider what havoc such\npeople would make with the furniture of a nice house!\"\n\n\"That is true,\" answered Corey, with meek conviction.  \"I never thought\nof that.\"\n\n\"And if you were a poor man with a sick child, I doubt if you'd have so\nmuch heart for burglary as you have now,\" said James Bellingham.\n\n\"It's wonderful how patient they are,\" said the minister.  \"The\nspectacle of the hopeless comfort the hard-working poor man sees must\nbe hard to bear.\"\n\nLapham wanted to speak up and say that he had been there himself, and\nknew how such a man felt.  He wanted to tell them that generally a poor\nman was satisfied if he could make both ends meet; that he didn't envy\nany one his good luck, if he had earned it, so long as he wasn't\nrunning under himself.  But before he could get the courage to address\nthe whole table, Sewell added, \"I suppose he don't always think of it.\"\n\n\"But some day he WILL think about it,\" said Corey.  \"In fact, we rather\ninvite him to think about it, in this country.\"\n\n\"My brother-in-law,\" said Charles Bellingham, with the pride a man\nfeels in a mentionably remarkable brother-in-law, \"has no end of\nfellows at work under him out there at Omaha, and he says it's the\nfellows from countries where they've been kept from thinking about it\nthat are discontented.  The Americans never make any trouble.  They\nseem to understand that so long as we give unlimited opportunity,\nnobody has a right to complain.\"\n\n\"What do you hear from Leslie?\" asked Mrs. Corey, turning from these\nprofitless abstractions to Mrs. Bellingham.\n\n\"You know,\" said that lady in a lower tone, \"that there is another\nbaby?\"\n\n\"No! I hadn't heard of it!\"\n\n\"Yes; a boy.  They have named him after his uncle.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Charles Bellingham, joining in.  \"He is said to be a noble\nboy, and to resemble me.\"\n\n\"All boys of that tender age are noble,\" said Corey, \"and look like\nanybody you wish them to resemble.  Is Leslie still home-sick for the\nbean-pots of her native Boston?\"\n\n\"She is getting over it, I fancy,\" replied Mrs. Bellingham.  \"She's\nvery much taken up with Mr. Blake's enterprises, and leads a very\nexciting life.  She says she's like people who have been home from\nEurope three years; she's past the most poignant stage of regret, and\nhasn't reached the second, when they feel that they must go again.\"\n\nLapham leaned a little toward Mrs. Corey, and said of a picture which\nhe saw on the wall opposite, \"Picture of your daughter, I presume?\"\n\n\"No; my daughter's grandmother.  It's a Stewart Newton; he painted a\ngreat many Salem beauties.  She was a Miss Polly Burroughs.  My\ndaughter IS like her, don't you think?\" They both looked at Nanny Corey\nand then at the portrait.  \"Those pretty old-fashioned dresses are\ncoming in again.  I'm not surprised you took it for her.  The\nothers\"--she referred to the other portraits more or less darkling on\nthe walls--\"are my people; mostly Copleys.\"\n\nThese names, unknown to Lapham, went to his head like the wine he was\ndrinking; they seemed to carry light for the moment, but a film of\ndeeper darkness followed.  He heard Charles Bellingham telling funny\nstories to Irene and trying to amuse the girl; she was laughing, and\nseemed very happy.  From time to time Bellingham took part in the\ngeneral talk between the host and James Bellingham and Miss Kingsbury\nand that minister, Mr. Sewell.  They talked of people mostly; it\nastonished Lapham to hear with what freedom they talked.  They\ndiscussed these persons unsparingly; James Bellingham spoke of a man\nknown to Lapham for his business success and great wealth as not a\ngentleman; his cousin Charles said he was surprised that the fellow had\nkept from being governor so long.\n\nWhen the latter turned from Irene to make one of these excursions into\nthe general talk, young Corey talked to her; and Lapham caught some\nwords from which it seemed that they were speaking of Penelope.  It\nvexed him to think she had not come; she could have talked as well as\nany of them; she was just as bright; and Lapham was aware that Irene\nwas not as bright, though when he looked at her face, triumphant in its\nyoung beauty and fondness, he said to himself that it did not make any\ndifference.  He felt that he was not holding up his end of the line,\nhowever.  When some one spoke to him he could only summon a few words\nof reply, that seemed to lead to nothing; things often came into his\nmind appropriate to what they were saying, but before he could get them\nout they were off on something else; they jumped about so, he could not\nkeep up; but he felt, all the same, that he was not doing himself\njustice.\n\nAt one time the talk ran off upon a subject that Lapham had never heard\ntalked of before; but again he was vexed that Penelope was not there,\nto have her say; he believed that her say would have been worth hearing.\n\nMiss Kingsbury leaned forward and asked Charles Bellingham if he had\nread Tears, Idle Tears, the novel that was making such a sensation; and\nwhen he said no, she said she wondered at him.  \"It's perfectly\nheart-breaking, as you'll imagine from the name; but there's such a\ndear old-fashioned hero and heroine in it, who keep dying for each\nother all the way through, and making the most wildly satisfactory and\nunnecessary sacrifices for each other.  You feel as if you'd done them\nyourself.\"\n\n\"Ah, that's the secret of its success,\" said Bromfield Corey.  \"It\nflatters the reader by painting the characters colossal, but with his\nlimp and stoop, so that he feels himself of their supernatural\nproportions.  You've read it, Nanny?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said his daughter.  \"It ought to have been called Slop, Silly\nSlop.\"\n\n\"Oh, not quite SLOP, Nanny,\" pleaded Miss Kingsbury.\n\n\"It's astonishing,\" said Charles Bellingham, \"how we do like the books\nthat go for our heart-strings. And I really suppose that you can't put\na more popular thing than self-sacrifice into a novel.  We do like to\nsee people suffering sublimely.\"\n\n\"There was talk some years ago,\" said James Bellingham, \"about novels\ngoing out.\" \"They're just coming in!\" cried Miss Kingsbury.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Sewell, the minister.  \"And I don't think there ever\nwas a time when they formed the whole intellectual experience of more\npeople.  They do greater mischief than ever.\"\n\n\"Don't be envious, parson,\" said the host.\n\n\"No,\" answered Sewell.  \"I should be glad of their help.  But those\nnovels with old-fashioned heroes and heroines in them--excuse me, Miss\nKingsbury--are ruinous!\"\n\n\"Don't you feel like a moral wreck, Miss Kingsbury?\" asked the host.\n\nBut Sewell went on: \"The novelists might be the greatest possible help\nto us if they painted life as it is, and human feelings in their true\nproportion and relation, but for the most part they have been and are\naltogether noxious.\"\n\nThis seemed sense to Lapham; but Bromfield Corey asked: \"But what if\nlife as it is isn't amusing? Aren't we to be amused?\"\n\n\"Not to our hurt,\" sturdily answered the minister.  \"And the\nself-sacrifice painted in most novels like this----\"\n\n\"Slop, Silly Slop?\" suggested the proud father of the inventor of the\nphrase.\n\n\"Yes--is nothing but psychical suicide, and is as wholly immoral as the\nspectacle of a man falling upon his sword.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know but you're right, parson,\" said the host; and the\nminister, who had apparently got upon a battle-horse of his, careered\nonward in spite of some tacit attempts of his wife to seize the bridle.\n\n\"Right? To be sure I am right.  The whole business of love, and\nlove-making and marrying, is painted by the novelists in a monstrous\ndisproportion to the other relations of life.  Love is very sweet, very\npretty----\"\n\n\"Oh, THANK you, Mr. Sewell,\" said Nanny Corey, in a way that set them\nall laughing.\n\n\"But it's the affair, commonly, of very young people, who have not yet\ncharacter and experience enough to make them interesting.  In novels\nit's treated, not only as if it were the chief interest of life, but\nthe sole interest of the lives of two ridiculous young persons; and it\nis taught that love is perpetual, that the glow of a true passion lasts\nfor ever; and that it is sacrilege to think or act otherwise.\" \"Well,\nbut isn't that true, Mr. Sewell?\" pleaded Miss Kingsbury.\n\n\"I have known some most estimable people who had married a second\ntime,\" said the minister, and then he had the applause with him.\nLapham wanted to make some open recognition of his good sense, but\ncould not.\n\n\"I suppose the passion itself has been a good deal changed,\" said\nBromfield Corey, \"since the poets began to idealise it in the days of\nchivalry.\"\n\n\"Yes; and it ought to be changed again,\" said Mr. Sewell.\n\n\"What! Back?\"\n\n\"I don't say that.  But it ought to be recognised as something natural\nand mortal, and divine honours, which belong to righteousness alone,\nought not to be paid it.\"\n\n\"Oh, you ask too much, parson,\" laughed his host, and the talk wandered\naway to something else.\n\nIt was not an elaborate dinner; but Lapham was used to having\neverything on the table at once, and this succession of dishes\nbewildered him; he was afraid perhaps he was eating too much.  He now\nno longer made any pretence of not drinking his wine, for he was\nthirsty, and there was no more water, and he hated to ask for any.  The\nice-cream came, and then the fruit.  Suddenly Mrs. Corey rose, and said\nacross the table to her husband, \"I suppose you will want your coffee\nhere.\" And he replied, \"Yes; we'll join you at tea.\"\n\nThe ladies all rose, and the gentlemen got up with them.  Lapham\nstarted to follow Mrs. Corey, but the other men merely stood in their\nplaces, except young Corey, who ran and opened the door for his mother.\nLapham thought with shame that it was he who ought to have done that;\nbut no one seemed to notice, and he sat down again gladly, after\nkicking out one of his legs which had gone to sleep.\n\nThey brought in cigars with coffee, and Bromfield Corey advised Lapham\nto take one that he chose for him.  Lapham confessed that he liked a\ngood cigar about as well as anybody, and Corey said: \"These are new.  I\nhad an Englishman here the other day who was smoking old cigars in the\nsuperstition that tobacco improved with age, like wine.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Lapham, \"anybody who had ever lived off a tobacco country\ncould tell him better than that.\" With the fuming cigar between his\nlips he felt more at home than he had before.  He turned sidewise in\nhis chair and, resting one arm on the back, intertwined the fingers of\nboth hands, and smoked at large ease.  James Bellingham came and sat\ndown by him.  \"Colonel Lapham, weren't you with the 96th Vermont when\nthey charged across the river in front of Pickensburg, and the rebel\nbattery opened fire on them in the water?\"\n\nLapham slowly shut his eyes and slowly dropped his head for assent,\nletting out a white volume of smoke from the corner of his mouth.\n\n\"I thought so,\" said Bellingham.  \"I was with the 85th Massachusetts,\nand I sha'n't forget that slaughter.  We were all new to it still.\nPerhaps that's why it made such an impression.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" suggested Charles Bellingham.  \"Was there anything much\nmore impressive afterward? I read of it out in Missouri, where I was\nstationed at the time, and I recollect the talk of some old army men\nabout it.  They said that death-rate couldn't be beaten.  I don't know\nthat it ever was.\"\n\n\"About one in five of us got out safe,\" said Lapham, breaking his\ncigar-ash off on the edge of a plate.  James Bellingham reached him a\nbottle of Apollinaris.  He drank a glass, and then went on smoking.\n\nThey all waited, as if expecting him to speak, and then Corey said:\n\"How incredible those things seem already!  You gentlemen KNOW that\nthey happened; but are you still able to believe it?\"\n\n\"Ah, nobody FEELS that anything happened,\" said Charles Bellingham.\n\"The past of one's experience doesn't differ a great deal from the past\nof one's knowledge.  It isn't much more probable; it's really a great\ndeal less vivid than some scenes in a novel that one read when a boy.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure of that,\" said James Bellingham.\n\n\"Well, James, neither am I,\" consented his cousin, helping himself from\nLapham's Apollinaris bottle.  \"There would be very little talking at\ndinner if one only said the things that one was sure of.\"\n\nThe others laughed, and Bromfield Corey remarked thoughtfully, \"What\nastonishes the craven civilian in all these things is the\nabundance--the superabundance--of heroism.  The cowards were the\nexception; the men that were ready to die, the rule.\"\n\n\"The woods were full of them,\" said Lapham, without taking his cigar\nfrom his mouth.\n\n\"That's a nice little touch in School,\" interposed Charles Bellingham,\n\"where the girl says to the fellow who was at Inkerman, 'I should think\nyou would be so proud of it,' and he reflects a while, and says, 'Well,\nthe fact is, you know, there were so many of us.'\"\n\n\"Yes, I remember that,\" said James Bellingham, smiling for pleasure in\nit.  \"But I don't see why you claim the credit of being a craven\ncivilian, Bromfield,\" he added, with a friendly glance at his\nbrother-in-law, and with the willingness Boston men often show to turn\none another's good points to the light in company; bred so intimately\ntogether at school and college and in society, they all know these\npoints.  \"A man who was out with Garibaldi in '48,\" continued James\nBellingham.\n\n\"Oh, a little amateur red-shirting,\" Corey interrupted in deprecation.\n\"But even if you choose to dispute my claim, what has become of all the\nheroism? Tom, how many club men do you know who would think it sweet\nand fitting to die for their country?\"\n\n\"I can't think of a great many at the moment, sir,\" replied the son,\nwith the modesty of his generation.\n\n\"And I couldn't in '61,\" said his uncle.  \"Nevertheless they were\nthere.\"\n\n\"Then your theory is that it's the occasion that is wanting,\" said\nBromfield Corey.  \"But why shouldn't civil service reform, and the\nresumption of specie payment, and a tariff for revenue only, inspire\nheroes? They are all good causes.\"\n\n\"It's the occasion that's wanting,\" said James Bellingham, ignoring the\npersiflage.  \"And I'm very glad of it.\"\n\n\"So am I,\" said Lapham, with a depth of feeling that expressed itself\nin spite of the haze in which his brain seemed to float.  There was a\ngreat deal of the talk that he could not follow; it was too quick for\nhim; but here was something he was clear of.  \"I don't want to see any\nmore men killed in my time.\" Something serious, something sombre must\nlurk behind these words, and they waited for Lapham to say more; but\nthe haze closed round him again, and he remained silent, drinking\nApollinaris.\n\n\"We non-combatants were notoriously reluctant to give up fighting,\"\nsaid Mr. Sewell, the minister; \"but I incline to think Colonel Lapham\nand Mr. Bellingham may be right.  I dare say we shall have the heroism\nagain if we have the occasion.  Till it comes, we must content\nourselves with the every-day generosities and sacrifices.  They make up\nin quantity what they lack in quality, perhaps.\" \"They're not so\npicturesque,\" said Bromfield Corey.  \"You can paint a man dying for his\ncountry, but you can't express on canvas a man fulfilling the duties of\na good citizen.\"\n\n\"Perhaps the novelists will get at him by and by,\" suggested Charles\nBellingham.  \"If I were one of these fellows, I shouldn't propose to\nmyself anything short of that.\"\n\n\"What? the commonplace?\" asked his cousin.\n\n\"Commonplace? The commonplace is just that light, impalpable, aerial\nessence which they've never got into their confounded books yet.  The\nnovelist who could interpret the common feelings of commonplace people\nwould have the answer to 'the riddle of the painful earth' on his\ntongue.\"\n\n\"Oh, not so bad as that, I hope,\" said the host; and Lapham looked from\none to the other, trying to make out what they were at.  He had never\nbeen so up a tree before.\n\n\"I suppose it isn't well for us to see human nature at white heat\nhabitually,\" continued Bromfield Corey, after a while.  \"It would make\nus vain of our species.  Many a poor fellow in that war and in many\nanother has gone into battle simply and purely for his country's sake,\nnot knowing whether, if he laid down his life, he should ever find it\nagain, or whether, if he took it up hereafter, he should take it up in\nheaven or hell.  Come, parson!\" he said, turning to the minister, \"what\nhas ever been conceived of omnipotence, of omniscience, so sublime, so\ndivine as that?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" answered the minister quietly.  \"God has never been imagined\nat all.  But if you suppose such a man as that was Authorised, I think\nit will help you to imagine what God must be.\"\n\n\"There's sense in that,\" said Lapham.  He took his cigar out of his\nmouth, and pulled his chair a little toward the table, on which he\nplaced his ponderous fore-arms.  \"I want to tell you about a fellow I\nhad in my own company when we first went out.  We were all privates to\nbegin with; after a while they elected me captain--I'd had the tavern\nstand, and most of 'em knew me.  But Jim Millon never got to be\nanything more than corporal; corporal when he was killed.\" The others\narrested themselves in various attitudes of attention, and remained\nlistening to Lapham with an interest that profoundly flattered him.\nNow, at last, he felt that he was holding up his end of the rope.  \"I\ncan't say he went into the thing from the highest motives, altogether;\nour motives are always pretty badly mixed, and when there's such a\nhurrah-boys as there was then, you can't tell which is which.  I\nsuppose Jim Millon's wife was enough to account for his going, herself.\nShe was a pretty bad assortment,\" said Lapham, lowering his voice and\nglancing round at the door to make sure that it was shut, \"and she used\nto lead Jim ONE kind of life.  Well, sir,\" continued Lapham,\nsynthetising his auditors in that form of address, \"that fellow used to\nsave every cent of his pay and send it to that woman.  Used to get me\nto do it for him.  I tried to stop him.  'Why, Jim,' said I, 'you know\nwhat she'll do with it.' 'That's so, Cap,' says he, 'but I don't know\nwhat she'll do without it.' And it did keep her straight--straight as a\nstring--as long as Jim lasted.  Seemed as if there was something\nmysterious about it.  They had a little girl,--about as old as my\noldest girl,--and Jim used to talk to me about her.  Guess he done it\nas much for her as for the mother; and he said to me before the last\naction we went into, 'I should like to turn tail and run, Cap.  I ain't\ncomin' out o' this one.  But I don't suppose it would do.' 'Well, not\nfor you, Jim,' said I. 'I want to live,' he says; and he bust out\ncrying right there in my tent.  'I want to live for poor Molly and\nZerrilla'--that's what they called the little one; I dunno where they\ngot the name.  'I ain't ever had half a chance; and now she's doing\nbetter, and I believe we should get along after this.' He set there\ncryin' like a baby.  But he wa'n't no baby when he went into action.  I\nhated to look at him after it was over, not so much because he'd got a\nball that was meant for me by a sharpshooter--he saw the devil takin'\naim, and he jumped to warn me--as because he didn't look like Jim; he\nlooked like--fun; all desperate and savage.  I guess he died hard.\"\n\nThe story made its impression, and Lapham saw it.  \"Now I say,\" he\nresumed, as if he felt that he was going to do himself justice, and say\nsomething to heighten the effect his story had produced.  At the same\ntime he was aware of a certain want of clearness.  He had the idea, but\nit floated vague, elusive, in his brain.  He looked about as if for\nsomething to precipitate it in tangible shape.\n\n\"Apollinaris?\" asked Charles Bellingham, handing the bottle from the\nother side.  He had drawn his chair closer than the rest to Lapham's,\nand was listening with great interest.  When Mrs. Corey asked him to\nmeet Lapham, he accepted gladly.  \"You know I go in for that sort of\nthing, Anna.  Since Leslie's affair we're rather bound to do it.  And I\nthink we meet these practical fellows too little.  There's always\nsomething original about them.\" He might naturally have believed that\nthe reward of his faith was coming.\n\n\"Thanks, I will take some of this wine,\" said Lapham, pouring himself a\nglass of Madeira from a black and dusty bottle caressed by a label\nbearing the date of the vintage.  He tossed off the wine, unconscious\nof its preciousness, and waited for the result.  That cloudiness in his\nbrain disappeared before it, but a mere blank remained.  He not only\ncould not remember what he was going to say, but he could not recall\nwhat they had been talking about.  They waited, looking at him, and he\nstared at them in return.  After a while he heard the host saying,\n\"Shall we join the ladies?\"\n\nLapham went, trying to think what had happened.  It seemed to him a\nlong time since he had drunk that wine.\n\nMiss Corey gave him a cup of tea, where he stood aloof from his wife,\nwho was talking with Miss Kingsbury and Mrs. Sewell; Irene was with\nMiss Nanny Corey.  He could not hear what they were talking about; but\nif Penelope had come, he knew that she would have done them all credit.\nHe meant to let her know how he felt about her behaviour when he got\nhome.  It was a shame for her to miss such a chance.  Irene was looking\nbeautiful, as pretty as all the rest of them put together, but she was\nnot talking, and Lapham perceived that at a dinner-party you ought to\ntalk.  He was himself conscious of having, talked very well.  He now\nwore an air of great dignity, and, in conversing with the other\ngentlemen, he used a grave and weighty deliberation.  Some of them\nwanted him to go into the library.  There he gave his ideas of books.\nHe said he had not much time for anything but the papers; but he was\ngoing to have a complete library in his new place.  He made an\nelaborate acknowledgment to Bromfield Corey of his son's kindness in\nsuggesting books for his library; he said that he had ordered them all,\nand that he meant to have pictures.  He asked Mr. Corey who was about\nthe best American painter going now.  \"I don't set up to be a judge of\npictures, but I know what I like,\" he said.  He lost the reserve which\nhe had maintained earlier, and began to boast.  He himself introduced\nthe subject of his paint, in a natural transition from pictures; he\nsaid Mr. Corey must take a run up to Lapham with him some day, and see\nthe Works; they would interest him, and he would drive him round the\ncountry; he kept most of his horses up there, and he could show Mr.\nCorey some of the finest Jersey grades in the country.  He told about\nhis brother William, the judge at Dubuque; and a farm he had out there\nthat paid for itself every year in wheat.  As he cast off all fear, his\nvoice rose, and he hammered his arm-chair with the thick of his hand\nfor emphasis.  Mr. Corey seemed impressed; he sat perfectly quiet,\nlistening, and Lapham saw the other gentlemen stop in their talk every\nnow and then to listen.  After this proof of his ability to interest\nthem, he would have liked to have Mrs. Lapham suggest again that he was\nunequal to their society, or to the society of anybody else.  He\nsurprised himself by his ease among men whose names had hitherto\noverawed him.  He got to calling Bromfield Corey by his surname alone.\nHe did not understand why young Corey seemed so preoccupied, and he\ntook occasion to tell the company how he had said to his wife the first\ntime he saw that fellow that he could make a man of him if he had him\nin the business; and he guessed he was not mistaken.  He began to tell\nstories of the different young men he had had in his employ.  At last\nhe had the talk altogether to himself; no one else talked, and he\ntalked unceasingly.  It was a great time; it was a triumph.\n\nHe was in this successful mood when word came to him that Mrs. Lapham\nwas going; Tom Corey seemed to have brought it, but he was not sure.\nAnyway, he was not going to hurry.  He made cordial invitations to each\nof the gentlemen to drop in and see him at his office, and would not be\nsatisfied till he had exacted a promise from each.  He told Charles\nBellingham that he liked him, and assured James Bellingham that it had\nalways been his ambition to know him, and that if any one had said when\nhe first came to Boston that in less than ten years he should be\nhobnobbing with Jim Bellingham, he should have told that person he\nlied.  He would have told anybody he lied that had told him ten years\nago that a son of Bromfield Corey would have come and asked him to take\nhim into the business.  Ten years ago he, Silas Lapham, had come to\nBoston a little worse off than nothing at all, for he was in debt for\nhalf the money that he had bought out his partner with, and here he was\nnow worth a million, and meeting you gentlemen like one of you.  And\nevery cent of that was honest money,--no speculation,--every copper of\nit for value received.  And here, only the other day, his old partner,\nwho had been going to the dogs ever since he went out of the business,\ncame and borrowed twenty thousand dollars of him! Lapham lent it\nbecause his wife wanted him to: she had always felt bad about the\nfellow's having to go out of the business.\n\nHe took leave of Mr. Sewell with patronising affection, and bade him\ncome to him if he ever got into a tight place with his parish work; he\nwould let him have all the money he wanted; he had more money than he\nknew what to do with.  \"Why, when your wife sent to mine last fall,\" he\nsaid, turning to Mr. Corey, \"I drew my cheque for five hundred dollars,\nbut my wife wouldn't take more than one hundred; said she wasn't going\nto show off before Mrs. Corey.  I call that a pretty good joke on Mrs.\nCorey.  I must tell her how Mrs. Lapham done her out of a cool four\nhundred dollars.\"\n\nHe started toward the door of the drawing-room to take leave of the\nladies; but Tom Corey was at his elbow, saying, \"I think Mrs. Lapham is\nwaiting for you below, sir,\" and in obeying the direction Corey gave\nhim toward another door he forgot all about his purpose, and came away\nwithout saying good-night to his hostess.\n\nMrs. Lapham had not known how soon she ought to go, and had no idea\nthat in her quality of chief guest she was keeping the others.  She\nstayed till eleven o'clock, and was a little frightened when she found\nwhat time it was; but Mrs. Corey, without pressing her to stay longer,\nhad said it was not at all late.  She and Irene had had a perfect time.\nEverybody had been very polite, on the way home they celebrated the\namiability of both the Miss Coreys and of Miss Kingsbury.  Mrs. Lapham\nthought that Mrs. Bellingham was about the pleasantest person she ever\nsaw; she had told her all about her married daughter who had married an\ninventor and gone to live in Omaha--a Mrs. Blake.\n\n\"If it's that car-wheel Blake,\" said Lapham proudly, \"I know all about\nhim.  I've sold him tons of the paint.\"\n\n\"Pooh, papa! How you do smell of smoking!\" cried Irene.\n\n\"Pretty strong, eh?\" laughed Lapham, letting down a window of the\ncarriage.  His heart was throbbing wildly in the close air, and he was\nglad of the rush of cold that came in, though it stopped his tongue,\nand he listened more and more drowsily to the rejoicings that his wife\nand daughter exchanged.  He meant to have them wake Penelope up and\ntell her what she had lost; but when he reached home he was too sleepy\nto suggest it.  He fell asleep as soon as his head touched the pillow,\nfull of supreme triumph.\n\nBut in the morning his skull was sore with the unconscious, night-long\nache; and he rose cross and taciturn.  They had a silent breakfast.  In\nthe cold grey light of the morning the glories of the night before\nshowed poorer.  Here and there a painful doubt obtruded itself and\nmarred them with its awkward shadow.  Penelope sent down word that she\nwas not well, and was not coming to breakfast, and Lapham was glad to\ngo to his office without seeing her.\n\nHe was severe and silent all day with his clerks, and peremptory with\ncustomers.  Of Corey he was slyly observant, and as the day wore away\nhe grew more restively conscious.  He sent out word by his office-boy\nthat he would like to see Mr. Corey for a few minutes after closing.\nThe type-writer girl had lingered too, as if she wished to speak with\nhim, and Corey stood in abeyance as she went toward Lapham's door.\n\n\"Can't see you to-night, Zerrilla,\" he said bluffly, but not unkindly.\n\"Perhaps I'll call at the house, if it's important.\"\n\n\"It is,\" said the girl, with a spoiled air of insistence.\n\n\"Well,\" said Lapham, and, nodding to Corey to enter, he closed the door\nupon her.  Then he turned to the young, man and demanded: \"Was I drunk\nlast night?\"\n\n\n\nXV.\n\n\nLAPHAM'S strenuous face was broken up with the emotions that had forced\nhim to this question: shame, fear of the things that must have been\nthought of him, mixed with a faint hope that he might be mistaken,\nwhich died out at the shocked and pitying look in Corey's eyes.\n\n\"Was I drunk?\" he repeated.  \"I ask you, because I was never touched by\ndrink in my life before, and I don't know.\" He stood with his huge\nhands trembling on the back of his chair, and his dry lips apart, as he\nstared at Corey.\n\n\"That is what every one understood, Colonel Lapham,\" said the young\nman.  \"Every one saw how it was.  Don't----\"\n\n\"Did they talk it over after I left?\" asked Lapham vulgarly.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" said Corey, blushing, \"my father doesn't talk his guests\nover with one another.\" He added, with youthful superfluity, \"You were\namong gentlemen.\"\n\n\"I was the only one that wasn't a gentleman there!\" lamented Lapham.\n\"I disgraced you! I disgraced my family! I mortified your father before\nhis friends!\" His head dropped.  \"I showed that I wasn't fit to go with\nyou.  I'm not fit for any decent place.  What did I say? What did I\ndo?\" he asked, suddenly lifting his head and confronting Corey.  \"Out\nwith it! If you could bear to see it and hear it, I had ought to bear\nto know it!\"\n\n\"There was nothing--really nothing,\" said Corey.  \"Beyond the fact that\nyou were not quite yourself, there was nothing whatever.  My father DID\nspeak of it to me,\" he confessed, \"when we were alone.  He said that he\nwas afraid we had not been thoughtful of you, if you were in the habit\nof taking only water; I told him I had not seen wine at your table.\nThe others said nothing about you.\"\n\n\"Ah, but what did they think?\"\n\n\"Probably what we did: that it was purely a misfortune--an accident.\"\n\n\"I wasn't fit to be there,\" persisted Lapham.  \"Do you want to leave?\"\nhe asked, with savage abruptness.\n\n\"Leave?\" faltered the young man.\n\n\"Yes; quit the business? Cut the whole connection?\"\n\n\"I haven't the remotest idea of it!\" cried Corey in amazement.  \"Why in\nthe world should I?\" \"Because you're a gentleman, and I'm not, and it\nain't right I should be over you.  If you want to go, I know some\nparties that would be glad to get you.  I will give you up if you want\nto go before anything worse happens, and I shan't blame you.  I can\nhelp you to something better than I can offer you here, and I will.\"\n\n\"There's no question of my going, unless you wish it,\" said Corey.  \"If\nyou do----\"\n\n\"Will you tell your father,\" interrupted Lapham, \"that I had a notion\nall the time that I was acting the drunken blackguard, and that I've\nsuffered for it all day? Will you tell him I don't want him to notice\nme if we ever meet, and that I know I'm not fit to associate with\ngentlemen in anything but a business way, if I am that?\"\n\n\"Certainly I shall do nothing of the kind,\" retorted Corey.  \"I can't\nlisten to you any longer.  What you say is shocking to me--shocking in\na way you can't think.\"\n\n\"Why, man!\" exclaimed Lapham, with astonishment; \"if I can stand it,\nYOU can!\"\n\n\"No,\" said Corey, with a sick look, \"that doesn't follow.  You may\ndenounce yourself, if you will; but I have my reasons for refusing to\nhear you--my reasons why I CAN'T hear you.  If you say another word I\nmust go away.\"\n\n\"I don't understand you,\" faltered Lapham, in bewilderment, which\nabsorbed even his shame.\n\n\"You exaggerate the effect of what has happened,\" said the young man.\n\"It's enough, more than enough, for you to have mentioned the matter to\nme, and I think it's unbecoming in me to hear you.\"\n\nHe made a movement toward the door, but Lapham stopped him with the\ntragic humility of his appeal.  \"Don't go yet! I can't let you.  I've\ndisgusted you,--I see that; but I didn't mean to.  I--I take it back.\"\n\n\"Oh, there's nothing to take back,\" said Corey, with a repressed\nshudder for the abasement which he had seen.  \"But let us say no more\nabout it--think no more.  There wasn't one of the gentlemen present\nlast night who didn't understand the matter precisely as my father and\nI did, and that fact must end it between us two.\"\n\nHe went out into the larger office beyond, leaving Lapham helpless to\nprevent his going.  It had become a vital necessity with him to think\nthe best of Lapham, but his mind was in a whirl of whatever thoughts\nwere most injurious.  He thought of him the night before in the company\nof those ladies and gentlemen, and he quivered in resentment of his\nvulgar, braggart, uncouth nature.  He recognised his own allegiance to\nthe exclusiveness to which he was born and bred, as a man perceives his\nduty to his country when her rights are invaded.  His eye fell on the\nporter going about in his shirt-sleeves to make the place fast for the\nnight, and he said to himself that Dennis was not more plebeian than\nhis master; that the gross appetites, the blunt sense, the purblind\nambition, the stupid arrogance were the same in both, and the\ndifference was in a brute will that probably left the porter the\ngentler man of the two.  The very innocence of Lapham's life in the\ndirection in which he had erred wrought against him in the young man's\nmood: it contained the insult of clownish inexperience.  Amidst the\nstings and flashes of his wounded pride, all the social traditions, all\nthe habits of feeling, which he had silenced more and more by force of\nwill during the past months, asserted their natural sway, and he rioted\nin his contempt of the offensive boor, who was even more offensive in\nhis shame than in his trespass.  He said to himself that he was a\nCorey, as if that were somewhat; yet he knew that at the bottom of his\nheart all the time was that which must control him at last, and which\nseemed sweetly to be suffering his rebellion, secure of his submission\nin the end.  It was almost with the girl's voice that it seemed to\nplead with him, to undo in him, effect by effect, the work of his\nindignant resentment, to set all things in another and fairer light, to\ngive him hopes, to suggest palliations, to protest against injustices.\nIt WAS in Lapham's favour that he was so guiltless in the past, and now\nCorey asked himself if it were the first time he could have wished a\nguest at his father's table to have taken less wine; whether Lapham was\nnot rather to be honoured for not knowing how to contain his folly\nwhere a veteran transgressor might have held his tongue.  He asked\nhimself, with a thrill of sudden remorse, whether, when Lapham humbled\nhimself in the dust so shockingly, he had shown him the sympathy to\nwhich such ABANDON had the right; and he had to own that he had met him\non the gentlemanly ground, sparing himself and asserting the\nsuperiority of his sort, and not recognising that Lapham's humiliation\ncame from the sense of wrong, which he had helped to accumulate upon\nhim by superfinely standing aloof and refusing to touch him.\n\nHe shut his desk and hurried out into the early night, not to go\nanywhere, but to walk up and down, to try to find his way out of the\nchaos, which now seemed ruin, and now the materials out of which fine\nactions and a happy life might be shaped.  Three hours later he stood\nat Lapham's door.\n\nAt times what he now wished to do had seemed for ever impossible, and\nagain it had seemed as if he could not wait a moment longer.  He had\nnot been careless, but very mindful of what he knew must be the\nfeelings of his own family in regard to the Laphams, and he had not\nconcealed from himself that his family had great reason and justice on\ntheir side in not wishing him to alienate himself from their common\nlife and associations.  The most that he could urge to himself was that\nthey had not all the reason and justice; but he had hesitated and\ndelayed because they had so much.  Often he could not make it appear\nright that he should merely please himself in what chiefly concerned\nhimself.  He perceived how far apart in all their experiences and\nideals the Lapham girls and his sisters were; how different Mrs. Lapham\nwas from his mother; how grotesquely unlike were his father and Lapham;\nand the disparity had not always amused him.\n\nHe had often taken it very seriously, and sometimes he said that he\nmust forego the hope on which his heart was set.  There had been many\ntimes in the past months when he had said that he must go no further,\nand as often as he had taken this stand he had yielded it, upon this or\nthat excuse, which he was aware of trumping up.  It was part of the\ncomplication that he should be unconscious of the injury he might be\ndoing to some one besides his family and himself; this was the defect\nof his diffidence; and it had come to him in a pang for the first time\nwhen his mother said that she would not have the Laphams think she\nwished to make more of the acquaintance than he did; and then it had\ncome too late.  Since that he had suffered quite as much from the fear\nthat it might not be as that it might be so; and now, in the mood,\nromantic and exalted, in which he found himself concerning Lapham, he\nwas as far as might be from vain confidence.  He ended the question in\nhis own mind by affirming to himself that he was there, first of all,\nto see Lapham and give him an ultimate proof of his own perfect faith\nand unabated respect, and to offer him what reparation this involved\nfor that want of sympathy--of humanity--which he had shown.\n\n\n\nXVI.\n\n\nTHE Nova Scotia second-girl who answered Corey's ring said that Lapham\nhad not come home yet.\n\n\"Oh,\" said the young man, hesitating on the outer step.\n\n\"I guess you better come in,\" said the girl, \"I'll go and see when\nthey're expecting him.\"\n\nCorey was in the mood to be swayed by any chance.  He obeyed the\nsuggestion of the second-girl's patronising friendliness, and let her\nshut him into the drawing-room, while she went upstairs to announce him\nto Penelope.  \"Did you tell him father wasn't at home?\"\n\n\"Yes. He seemed so kind of disappointed, I told him to come in, and I'd\nsee when he WOULD be in,\" said the girl, with the human interest which\nsometimes replaces in the American domestic the servile deference of\nother countries.\n\nA gleam of amusement passed over Penelope's face, as she glanced at\nherself in the glass.  \"Well,\" she cried finally, dropping from her\nshoulders the light shawl in which she had been huddled over a book\nwhen Corey rang, \"I will go down.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said the girl, and Penelope began hastily to amend the\ndisarray of her hair, which she tumbled into a mass on the top of her\nlittle head, setting off the pale dark of her complexion with a flash\nof crimson ribbon at her throat.  She moved across the carpet once or\ntwice with the quaint grace that belonged to her small figure, made a\ndissatisfied grimace at it in the glass, caught a handkerchief out of a\ndrawer and slid it into her pocket, and then descended to Corey.\n\nThe Lapham drawing-room in Nankeen Square was in the parti-coloured\npaint which the Colonel had hoped to repeat in his new house: the trim\nof the doors and windows was in light green and the panels in salmon;\nthe walls were a plain tint of French grey paper, divided by gilt\nmouldings into broad panels with a wide stripe of red velvet paper\nrunning up the corners; the chandelier was of massive imitation bronze;\nthe mirror over the mantel rested on a fringed mantel-cover of green\nreps, and heavy curtains of that stuff hung from gilt lambrequin frames\nat the window; the carpet was of a small pattern in crude green, which,\nat the time Mrs. Lapham bought it, covered half the new floors in\nBoston.  In the panelled spaces on the walls were some stone-coloured\nlandscapes, representing the mountains and canyons of the West, which\nthe Colonel and his wife had visited on one of the early official\nrailroad excursions.  In front of the long windows looking into the\nSquare were statues, kneeling figures which turned their backs upon the\ncompany within-doors, and represented allegories of Faith and Prayer to\npeople without.  A white marble group of several figures, expressing an\nItalian conception of Lincoln Freeing the Slaves,--a Latin negro and\nhis wife,--with our Eagle flapping his wings in approval, at Lincoln's\nfeet, occupied one corner, and balanced the what-not of an earlier\nperiod in another.  These phantasms added their chill to that imparted\nby the tone of the walls, the landscapes, and the carpets, and\ncontributed to the violence of the contrast when the chandelier was\nlighted up full glare, and the heat of the whole furnace welled up from\nthe registers into the quivering atmosphere on one of the rare\noccasions when the Laphams invited company.\n\nCorey had not been in this room before; the family had always received\nhim in what they called the sitting-room.  Penelope looked into this\nfirst, and then she looked into the parlour, with a smile that broke\ninto a laugh as she discovered him standing under the single burner\nwhich the second-girl had lighted for him in the chandelier.\n\n\"I don't understand how you came to be put in there,\" she said, as she\nled the way to the cozier place, \"unless it was because Alice thought\nyou were only here on probation, anyway.  Father hasn't got home yet,\nbut I'm expecting him every moment; I don't know what's keeping him.\nDid the girl tell you that mother and Irene were out?\"\n\n\"No, she didn't say.  It's very good of you to see me.\" She had not\nseen the exaltation which he had been feeling, he perceived with half a\nsigh; it must all be upon this lower level; perhaps it was best so.\n\"There was something I wished to say to your father----I hope,\" he\nbroke off, \"you're better to-night.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, thank you,\" said Penelope, remembering that she had not been\nwell enough to go to dinner the night before.\n\n\"We all missed you very much.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you! I'm afraid you wouldn't have missed me if I had been\nthere.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, we should,\" said Corey, \"I assure you.\"\n\nThey looked at each other.\n\n\"I really think I believed I was saying something,\" said the girl.\n\n\"And so did I,\" replied the young man.  They laughed rather wildly, and\nthen they both became rather grave.\n\nHe took the chair she gave him, and looked across at her, where she sat\non the other side of the hearth, in a chair lower than his, with her\nhands dropped in her lap, and the back of her head on her shoulders as\nshe looked up at him.  The soft-coal fire in the grate purred and\nflickered; the drop-light cast a mellow radiance on her face.  She let\nher eyes fall, and then lifted them for an irrelevant glance at the\nclock on the mantel.\n\n\"Mother and Irene have gone to the Spanish Students' concert.\"\n\n\"Oh, have they?\" asked Corey; and he put his hat, which he had been\nholding in his hand, on the floor beside his chair.\n\nShe looked down at it for no reason, and then looked up at his face for\nno other, and turned a little red.  Corey turned a little red himself.\nShe who had always been so easy with him now became a little\nconstrained.\n\n\"Do you know how warm it is out-of-doors?\" he asked.\n\n\"No, is it warm? I haven't been out all day.\"\n\n\"It's like a summer night.\"\n\nShe turned her face towards the fire, and then started abruptly.\n\"Perhaps it's too warm for you here?\"\n\n\"Oh no, it's very comfortable.\"\n\n\"I suppose it's the cold of the last few days that's still in the\nhouse.  I was reading with a shawl on when you came.\"\n\n\"I interrupted you.\"\n\n\"Oh no.  I had finished the book.  I was just looking over it again.\"\n\n\"Do you like to read books over?\"\n\n\"Yes; books that I like at all.\"\n\n\"That was it?\" asked Corey.\n\nThe girl hesitated.  \"It has rather a sentimental name.  Did you ever\nread it?--Tears, Idle Tears.\"\n\n\"Oh yes; they were talking of that last night; it's a famous book with\nladies.  They break their hearts over it.  Did it make you cry?\"\n\n\"Oh, it's pretty easy to cry over a book,\" said Penelope, laughing;\n\"and that one is very natural till you come to the main point.  Then\nthe naturalness of all the rest makes that seem natural too; but I\nguess it's rather forced.\"\n\n\"Her giving him up to the other one?\"\n\n\"Yes; simply because she happened to know that the other one had cared\nfor him first.  Why should she have done it? What right had she?\"\n\n\"I don't know.  I suppose that the self-sacrifice----\"\n\n\"But it WASN'T self-sacrifice--or not self-sacrifice alone.  She was\nsacrificing him too; and for some one who couldn't appreciate him half\nas much as she could.  I'm provoked with myself when I think how I\ncried over that book--for I did cry.  It's silly--it's wicked for any\none to do what that girl did.  Why can't they let people have a chance\nto behave reasonably in stories?\"\n\n\"Perhaps they couldn't make it so attractive,\" suggested Corey, with a\nsmile.\n\n\"It would be novel, at any rate,\" said the girl.  \"But so it would in\nreal life, I suppose,\" she added.\n\n\"I don't know.  Why shouldn't people in love behave sensibly?\"\n\n\"That's a very serious question,\" said Penelope gravely.  \"I couldn't\nanswer it,\" and she left him the embarrassment of supporting an inquiry\nwhich she had certainly instigated herself.  She seemed to have finally\nrecovered her own ease in doing this.  \"Do you admire our autumnal\ndisplay, Mr. Corey?\"\n\n\"Your display?\"\n\n\"The trees in the Square.  WE think it's quite equal to an opening at\nJordan & Marsh's.\"\n\n\"Ah, I'm afraid you wouldn't let me be serious even about your maples.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I should--if you like to be serious.\"\n\n\"Don't you?\"\n\n\"Well not about serious matters.  That's the reason that book made me\ncry.\"\n\n\"You make fun of everything.  Miss Irene was telling me last night\nabout you.\"\n\n\"Then it's no use for me to deny it so soon.  I must give Irene a\ntalking to.\"\n\n\"I hope you won't forbid her to talk about you!\"\n\nShe had taken up a fan from the table, and held it, now between her\nface and the fire, and now between her face and him.  Her little\nvisage, with that arch, lazy look in it, topped by its mass of dusky\nhair, and dwindling from the full cheeks to the small chin, had a\nJapanese effect in the subdued light, and it had the charm which comes\nto any woman with happiness.  It would be hard to say how much of this\nshe perceived that he felt.  They talked about other things a while,\nand then she came back to what he had said.  She glanced at him\nobliquely round her fan, and stopped moving it.  \"Does Irene talk about\nme?\" she asked.  \"I think so--yes.  Perhaps it's only I who talk about\nyou.  You must blame me if it's wrong,\" he returned.\n\n\"Oh, I didn't say it was wrong,\" she replied.  \"But I hope if you said\nanything very bad of me you'll let me know what it was, so that I can\nreform----\"\n\n\"No, don't change, please!\" cried the young man.\n\nPenelope caught her breath, but went on resolutely,--\"or rebuke you\nfor speaking evil of dignities.\" She looked down at the fan, now flat\nin her lap, and tried to govern her head, but it trembled, and she\nremained looking down.  Again they let the talk stray, and then it was\nhe who brought it back to themselves, as if it had not left them.\n\n\"I have to talk OF you,\" said Corey, \"because I get to talk TO you so\nseldom.\"\n\n\"You mean that I do all the talking when we're--together?\" She glanced\nsidewise at him; but she reddened after speaking the last word.\n\n\"We're so seldom together,\" he pursued.\n\n\"I don't know what you mean----\"\n\n\"Sometimes I've thought--I've been afraid that you avoided me.\"\n\n\"Avoided you?\"\n\n\"Yes! Tried not to be alone with me.\"\n\nShe might have told him that there was no reason why she should be\nalone with him, and that it was very strange he should make this\ncomplaint of her.  But she did not.  She kept looking down at the fan,\nand then she lifted her burning face and looked at the clock again.\n\"Mother and Irene will be sorry to miss you,\" she gasped.\n\nHe instantly rose and came towards her.  She rose too, and mechanically\nput out her hand.  He took it as if to say good-night. \"I didn't mean\nto send you away,\" she besought him.\n\n\"Oh, I'm not going,\" he answered simply.  \"I wanted to say--to say that\nit's I who make her talk about you.  To say I----There is something I\nwant to say to you; I've said it so often to myself that I feel as if\nyou must know it.\" She stood quite still, letting him keep her hand,\nand questioning his face with a bewildered gaze.  \"You MUST know--she\nmust have told you--she must have guessed----\" Penelope turned white,\nbut outwardly quelled the panic that sent the blood to her heart.\n\"I--I didn't expect--I hoped to have seen your father--but I must speak\nnow, whatever----I love you!\"\n\nShe freed her hand from both of those he had closed upon it, and went\nback from him across the room with a sinuous spring.  \"ME!\" Whatever\npotential complicity had lurked in her heart, his words brought her\nonly immeasurable dismay.\n\nHe came towards her again.  \"Yes, you.  Who else?\"\n\nShe fended him off with an imploring gesture.  \"I thought--I--it\nwas----\"\n\nShe shut her lips tight, and stood looking at him where he remained in\nsilent amaze.  Then her words came again, shudderingly.  \"Oh, what have\nyou done?\"\n\n\"Upon my soul,\" he said, with a vague smile, \"I don't know.  I hope no\nharm?\"\n\n\"Oh, don't laugh!\" she cried, laughing hysterically herself.  \"Unless\nyou want me to think you the greatest wretch in the world!\"\n\n\"I?\" he responded.  \"For heaven's sake tell me what you mean!\"\n\n\"You know I can't tell you.  Can you say--can you put your hand on your\nheart and say that--you--say you never meant--that you meant me--all\nalong?\"\n\n\"Yes!--yes! Who else? I came here to see your father, and to tell him\nthat I wished to tell you this--to ask him----But what does it matter?\nYou must have known it--you must have seen--and it's for you to answer\nme.  I've been abrupt, I know, and I've startled you; but if you love\nme, you can forgive that to my loving you so long before I spoke.\"\n\nShe gazed at him with parted lips.\n\n\"Oh, mercy! What shall I do? If it's true--what you say--you must go!\"\nshe said.  \"And you must never come any more.  Do you promise that?\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" said the young man.  \"Why should I promise such a\nthing--so abominably wrong? I could obey if you didn't love me----\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't! Indeed I don't! Now will you obey.\"\n\n\"No. I don't believe you.\" \"Oh!\"\n\nHe possessed himself of her hand again.\n\n\"My love--my dearest! What is this trouble, that you can't tell it? It\ncan't be anything about yourself.  If it is anything about any one\nelse, it wouldn't make the least difference in the world, no matter\nwhat it was.  I would be only too glad to show by any act or deed I\ncould that nothing could change me towards you.\"\n\n\"Oh, you don't understand!\"\n\n\"No, I don't. You must tell me.\"\n\n\"I will never do that.\"\n\n\"Then I will stay here till your mother comes, and ask her what it is.\"\n\n\"Ask HER?\"\n\n\"Yes! Do you think I will give you up till I know why I must?\"\n\n\"You force me to it! Will you go if I tell you, and never let any human\ncreature know what you have said to me?\"\n\n\"Not unless you give me leave.\"\n\n\"That will be never.  Well, then----\" She stopped, and made two or\nthree ineffectual efforts to begin again.  \"No, no! I can't. You must\ngo!\"\n\n\"I will not go!\"\n\n\"You said you--loved me.  If you do, you will go.\"\n\nHe dropped the hands he had stretched towards her, and she hid her face\nin her own.\n\n\"There!\" she said, turning it suddenly upon him.  \"Sit down there.  And\nwill you promise me--on your honour--not to speak--not to try to\npersuade me--not to--touch me? You won't touch me?\"\n\n\"I will obey you, Penelope.\"\n\n\"As if you were never to see me again? As if I were dying?\"\n\n\"I will do what you say.  But I shall see you again; and don't talk of\ndying.  This is the beginning of life----\"\n\n\"No. It's the end,\" said the girl, resuming at last something of the\nhoarse drawl which the tumult of her feeling had broken into those\nhalf-articulate appeals.  She sat down too, and lifted her face towards\nhim.  \"It's the end of life for me, because I know now that I must have\nbeen playing false from the beginning.  You don't know what I mean, and\nI can never tell you.  It isn't my secret--it's some one else's.\nYou--you must never come here again.  I can't tell you why, and you\nmust never try to know.  Do you promise?\"\n\n\"You can forbid me.  I must do what you say.\"\n\n\"I do forbid you, then.  And you shall not think I am cruel----\"\n\n\"How could I think that?\"\n\n\"Oh, how hard you make it!\"\n\nCorey laughed for very despair.  \"Can I make it easier by disobeying\nyou?\"\n\n\"I know I am talking crazily.  But I'm not crazy.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" he said, with some wild notion of comforting her; \"but try to\ntell me this trouble! There is nothing under heaven--no calamity, no\nsorrow--that I wouldn't gladly share with you, or take all upon myself\nif I could!\"\n\n\"I know! But this you can't. Oh, my----\"\n\n\"Dearest! Wait! Think! Let me ask your mother--your father----\"\n\nShe gave a cry.\n\n\"No! If you do that, you will make me hate you! Will you----\"\n\nThe rattling of a latch-key was heard in the outer door.\n\n\"Promise!\" cried Penelope.\n\n\"Oh, I promise!\"\n\n\"Good-bye!\" She suddenly flung her arms round his neck, and, pressing\nher cheek tight against his, flashed out of the room by one door as her\nfather entered it by another.\n\nCorey turned to him in a daze.  \"I--I called to speak with you--about a\nmatter----But it's so late now.  I'll--I'll see you to-morrow.\"\n\n\"No time like the present,\" said Lapham, with a fierceness that did not\nseem referable to Corey.  He had his hat still on, and he glared at the\nyoung man out of his blue eyes with a fire that something else must\nhave kindled there.\n\n\"I really can't now,\" said Corey weakly.  \"It will do quite as well\nto-morrow. Good night, sir.\"\n\n\"Good night,\" answered Lapham abruptly, following him to the door, and\nshutting it after him.  \"I think the devil must have got into pretty\nmuch everybody to-night,\" he muttered, coming back to the room, where\nhe put down his hat.  Then he went to the kitchen-stairs and called\ndown, \"Hello, Alice! I want something to eat!\"\n\n\n\nXVII.\n\n\n\"WHAT's the reason the girls never get down to breakfast any more?\"\nasked Lapham, when he met his wife at the table in the morning.  He had\nbeen up an hour and a half, and he spoke with the severity of a hungry\nman.  \"It seems to me they don't amount to ANYthing.  Here I am, at my\ntime of life, up the first one in the house.  I ring the bell for the\ncook at quarter-past six every morning, and the breakfast is on the\ntable at half-past seven right along, like clockwork, but I never see\nanybody but you till I go to the office.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, you do, Si,\" said his wife soothingly.  \"The girls are nearly\nalways down.  But they're young, and it tires them more than it does us\nto get up early.\"\n\n\"They can rest afterwards.  They don't do anything after they ARE up,\"\ngrumbled Lapham.\n\n\"Well, that's your fault, ain't it?  You oughtn't to have made so much\nmoney, and then they'd have had to work.\" She laughed at Lapham's\nSpartan mood, and went on to excuse the young people.  \"Irene's been up\ntwo nights hand running, and Penelope says she ain't well.  What makes\nyou so cross about the girls? Been doing something you're ashamed of?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you when I've been doing anything to be ashamed of,\" growled\nLapham.\n\n\"Oh no, you won't!\" said his wife jollily.  \"You'll only be hard on the\nrest of us.  Come now, Si; what is it?\"\n\nLapham frowned into his coffee with sulky dignity, and said, without\nlooking up, \"I wonder what that fellow wanted here last night?\" \"What\nfellow?\"\n\n\"Corey. I found him here when I came home, and he said he wanted to see\nme; but he wouldn't stop.\"\n\n\"Where was he?\"\n\n\"In the sitting-room.\"\n\n\"Was Pen there?\"\n\n\"I didn't see her.\"\n\nMrs. Lapham paused, with her hand on the cream-jug. \"Why, what in the\nland did he want? Did he say he wanted you?\"\n\n\"That's what he said.\"\n\n\"And then he wouldn't stay?\"\n\n\"Well, then, I'll tell you just what it is, Silas Lapham.  He came\nhere\"--she looked about the room and lowered her voice--\"to see you\nabout Irene, and then he hadn't the courage.\"\n\n\"I guess he's got courage enough to do pretty much what he wants to,\"\nsaid Lapham glumly.  \"All I know is, he was here.  You better ask Pen\nabout it, if she ever gets down.\"\n\n\"I guess I shan't wait for her,\" said Mrs. Lapham; and, as her husband\nclosed the front door after him, she opened that of her daughter's room\nand entered abruptly.\n\nThe girl sat at the window, fully dressed, and as if she had been\nsitting there a long time.  Without rising, she turned her face towards\nher mother.  It merely showed black against the light, and revealed\nnothing till her mother came close to her with successive questions.\n\"Why, how long have you been up, Pen? Why don't you come to your\nbreakfast? Did you see Mr. Corey when he called last night? Why, what's\nthe matter with you? What have you been crying about?\"\n\n\"Have I been crying?\"\n\n\"Yes! Your cheeks are all wet!\"\n\n\"I thought they were on fire.  Well, I'll tell you what's happened.\"\nShe rose, and then fell back in her chair.  \"Lock the door!\" she\nordered, and her mother mechanically obeyed.  \"I don't want Irene in\nhere.  There's nothing the matter.  Only, Mr. Corey offered himself to\nme last night.\"\n\nHer mother remained looking at her, helpless, not so much with amaze,\nperhaps, as dismay.  \"Oh, I'm not a ghost! I wish I was! You had better\nsit down, mother.  You have got to know all about it.\"\n\nMrs. Lapham dropped nervelessly into the chair at the other window, and\nwhile the girl went slowly but briefly on, touching only the vital\npoints of the story, and breaking at times into a bitter drollery, she\nsat as if without the power to speak or stir.\n\n\"Well, that's all, mother.  I should say I had dreamt, it, if I had\nslept any last night; but I guess it really happened.\"\n\nThe mother glanced round at the bed, and said, glad to occupy herself\ndelayingly with the minor care: \"Why, you have been sitting up all\nnight! You will kill yourself.\"\n\n\"I don't know about killing myself, but I've been sitting up all\nnight,\" answered the girl.  Then, seeing that her mother remained\nblankly silent again, she demanded, \"Why don't you blame me, mother?\nWhy don't you say that I led him on, and tried to get him away from\nher?  Don't you believe I did?\"\n\nHer mother made her no answer, as if these ravings of self-accusal\nneeded none.  \"Do you think,\" she asked simply, \"that he got the idea\nyou cared for him?\"\n\n\"He knew it! How could I keep it from him? I said I didn't--at first!\"\n\n\"It was no use,\" sighed the mother.  \"You might as well said you did.\nIt couldn't help Irene any, if you didn't.\"\n\n\"I always tried to help her with him, even when I----\"\n\n\"Yes, I know.  But she never was equal to him.  I saw that from the\nstart; but I tried to blind myself to it.  And when he kept coming----\"\n\n\"You never thought of me!\" cried the girl, with a bitterness that\nreached her mother's heart.  \"I was nobody! I couldn't feel! No one\ncould care for me!\" The turmoil of despair, of triumph, of remorse and\nresentment, which filled her soul, tried to express itself in the words.\n\n\"No,\" said the mother humbly.  \"I didn't think of you.  Or I didn't\nthink of you enough.  It did come across me sometimes that may\nbe----But it didn't seem as if----And your going on so for Irene----\"\n\n\"You let me go on.  You made me always go and talk with him for her,\nand you didn't think I would talk to him for myself.  Well, I didn't!\"\n\n\"I'm punished for it.  When did you--begin to care for him!\"\n\n\"How do I know? What difference does it make? It's all over now, no\nmatter when it began.  He won't come here any more, unless I let him.\"\nShe could not help betraying her pride in this authority of hers, but\nshe went on anxiously enough, \"What will you say to Irene? She's safe\nas far as I'm concerned; but if he don't care for her, what will you\ndo?\"\n\n\"I don't know what to do,\" said Mrs. Lapham.  She sat in an apathy from\nwhich she apparently could not rouse herself.  \"I don't see as anything\ncan be done.\"\n\nPenelope laughed in a pitying derision.\n\n\"Well, let things go on then.  But they won't go on.\"\n\n\"No, they won't go on,\" echoed her mother.  \"She's pretty enough, and\nshe's capable; and your father's got the money--I don't know what I'm\nsaying! She ain't equal to him, and she never was.  I kept feeling it\nall the time, and yet I kept blinding myself.\"\n\n\"If he had ever cared for her,\" said Penelope, \"it wouldn't have\nmattered whether she was equal to him or not.  I'M not equal to him\neither.\"\n\nHer mother went on: \"I might have thought it was you; but I had got\nset----Well! I can see it all clear enough, now it's too late.  I don't\nknow what to do.\"\n\n\"And what do you expect me to do?\" demanded the girl.  \"Do you want ME\nto go to Irene and tell her that I've got him away from her?\"\n\n\"O good Lord!\" cried Mrs. Lapham.  \"What shall I do? What do you want I\nshould do, Pen?\"\n\n\"Nothing for me,\" said Penelope.  \"I've had it out with myself.  Now do\nthe best you can for Irene.\"\n\n\"I couldn't say you had done wrong, if you was to marry him to-day.\"\n\n\"Mother!\"\n\n\"No, I couldn't. I couldn't say but what you had been good and\nfaithfull all through, and you had a perfect right to do it.  There\nain't any one to blame.  He's behaved like a gentleman, and I can see\nnow that he never thought of her, and that it was you all the while.\nWell, marry him, then! He's got the right, and so have you.\"\n\n\"What about Irene? I don't want you to talk about me.  I can take care\nof myself.\"\n\n\"She's nothing but a child.  It's only a fancy with her.  She'll get\nover it.  She hain't really got her heart set on him.\"\n\n\"She's got her heart set on him, mother.  She's got her whole life set\non him.  You know that.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's so,\" said the mother, as promptly as if she had been\narguing to that rather than the contrary effect.\n\n\"If I could give him to her, I would.  But he isn't mine to give.\" She\nadded in a burst of despair, \"He isn't mine to keep!\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Mrs. Lapham, \"she has got to bear it.  I don't know what's\nto come of it all.  But she's got to bear her share of it.\" She rose\nand went toward the door.\n\nPenelope ran after her in a sort of terror.  \"You're not going to tell\nIrene?\" she gasped, seizing her mother by either shoulder.\n\n\"Yes, I am,\" said Mrs. Lapham.  \"If she's a woman grown, she can bear a\nwoman's burden.\"\n\n\"I can't let you tell Irene,\" said the girl, letting fall her face on\nher mother's neck.  \"Not Irene,\" she moaned.  \"I'm afraid to let you.\nHow can I ever look at her again?\"\n\n\"Why, you haven't done anything, Pen,\" said her mother soothingly.\n\n\"I wanted to! Yes, I must have done something.  How could I help it? I\ndid care for him from the first, and I must have tried to make him like\nme.  Do you think I did? No, no! You mustn't tell Irene! Not--\nnot--yet! Mother! Yes! I did try to get him from her!\" she cried,\nlifting her head, and suddenly looking her mother in the face with\nthose large dim eyes of hers.  \"What do you think? Even last night! It\nwas the first time I ever had him all to myself, for myself, and I know\nnow that I tried to make him think that I was pretty and--funny. And I\ndidn't try to make him think of her.  I knew that I pleased him, and I\ntried to please him more.  Perhaps I could have kept him from saying\nthat he cared for me; but when I saw he did--I must have seen it--I\ncouldn't.  I had never had him to myself, and for myself before.  I\nneedn't have seen him at all, but I wanted to see him; and when I was\nsitting there alone with him, how do I know what I did to let him feel\nthat I cared for him? Now, will you tell Irene? I never thought he did\ncare for me, and never expected him to.  But I liked him.  Yes--I did\nlike him! Tell her that! Or else I will.\"\n\n\"If it was to tell her he was dead,\" began Mrs. Lapham absently.\n\n\"How easy it would be!\" cried the girl in self-mockery.  \"But he's\nworse than dead to her; and so am I. I've turned it over a million\nways, mother; I've looked at it in every light you can put it in, and I\ncan't make anything but misery out of it.  You can see the misery at\nthe first glance, and you can't see more or less if you spend your life\nlooking at it.\" She laughed again, as if the hopelessness of the thing\namused her.  Then she flew to the extreme of self-assertion. \"Well, I\nHAVE a right to him, and he has a right to me.  If he's never done\nanything to make her think he cared for her,--and I know he hasn't;\nit's all been our doing, then he's free and I'm free.  We can't make\nher happy whatever we do; and why shouldn't I----No, that won't do! I\nreached that point before!\" She broke again into her desperate laugh.\n\"You may try now, mother!\"\n\n\"I'd best speak to your father first----\"\n\nPenelope smiled a little more forlornly than she had laughed.\n\n\"Well, yes; the Colonel will have to know.  It isn't a trouble that I\ncan keep to myself exactly.  It seems to belong to too many other\npeople.\"\n\nHer mother took a crazy encouragement from her return to her old way of\nsaying things.  \"Perhaps he can think of something.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't doubt but the Colonel will know just what to do!\"\n\n\"You mustn't be too down-hearted about it.  It--it'll all come\nright----\"\n\n\"You tell Irene that, mother.\"\n\nMrs. Lapham had put her hand on the door-key; she dropped it, and\nlooked at the girl with a sort of beseeching appeal for the comfort she\ncould not imagine herself.  \"Don't look at me, mother,\" said Penelope,\nshaking her head.  \"You know that if Irene were to die without knowing\nit, it wouldn't come right for me.\"\n\n\"Pen!\"\n\n\"I've read of cases where a girl gives up the man that loves her so as\nto make some other girl happy that the man doesn't love.  That might be\ndone.\"\n\n\"Your father would think you were a fool,\" said Mrs. Lapham, finding a\nsort of refuge in her strong disgust for the pseudo heroism.  \"No! If\nthere's to be any giving up, let it be by the one that shan't make\nanybody but herself suffer.  There's trouble and sorrow enough in the\nworld, without MAKING it on purpose!\"\n\nShe unlocked the door, but Penelope slipped round and set herself\nagainst it.  \"Irene shall not give up!\"\n\n\"I will see your father about it,\" said the mother.  \"Let me out\nnow----\"\n\n\"Don't let Irene come here!\"\n\n\"No. I will tell her that you haven't slept.  Go to bed now, and try to\nget some rest.  She isn't up herself yet.  You must have some\nbreakfast.\"\n\n\"No; let me sleep if I can.  I can get something when I wake up.  I'll\ncome down if I can't sleep.  Life has got to go on.  It does when\nthere's a death in the house, and this is only a little worse.\"\n\n\"Don't you talk nonsense!\" cried Mrs. Lapham, with angry authority.\n\n\"Well, a little better, then,\" said Penelope, with meek concession.\n\nMrs. Lapham attempted to say something, and could not.  She went out\nand opened Irene's door.  The girl lifted her head drowsily from her\npillow \"Don't disturb your sister when you get up, Irene.  She hasn't\nslept well----\"\n\n\"PLEASE don't talk! I'm almost DEAD with sleep!\" returned Irene.  \"Do\ngo, mamma! I shan't disturb her.\" She turned her face down in the\npillow, and pulled the covering up over her ears.\n\nThe mother slowly closed the door and went downstairs, feeling\nbewildered and baffled almost beyond the power to move.  The time had\nbeen when she would have tried to find out why this judgment had been\nsent upon her.  But now she could not feel that the innocent suffering\nof others was inflicted for her fault; she shrank instinctively from\nthat cruel and egotistic misinterpretation of the mystery of pain and\nloss.  She saw her two children, equally if differently dear to her,\ndestined to trouble that nothing could avert, and she could not blame\neither of them; she could not blame the means of this misery to them;\nhe was as innocent as they, and though her heart was sore against him\nin this first moment, she could still be just to him in it.  She was a\nwoman who had been used to seek the light by striving; she had hitherto\nliterally worked to it.  But it is the curse of prosperity that it\ntakes work away from us, and shuts that door to hope and health of\nspirit.  In this house, where everything had come to be done for her,\nshe had no tasks to interpose between her and her despair.  She sat\ndown in her own room and let her hands fall in her lap,--the hands that\nhad once been so helpful and busy,--and tried to think it all out.  She\nhad never heard of the fate that was once supposed to appoint the\nsorrows of men irrespective of their blamelessness or blame, before the\ntime when it came to be believed that sorrows were penalties; but in\nher simple way she recognised something like that mythic power when she\nrose from her struggle with the problem, and said aloud to herself,\n\"Well, the witch is in it.\" Turn which way she would, she saw no escape\nfrom the misery to come--the misery which had come already to Penelope\nand herself, and that must come to Irene and her father.  She started\nwhen she definitely thought of her husband, and thought with what\nviolence it would work in every fibre of his rude strength.  She feared\nthat, and she feared something worse--the effect which his pride and\nambition might seek to give it; and it was with terror of this, as well\nas the natural trust with which a woman must turn to her husband in any\nanxiety at last, that she felt she could not wait for evening to take\ncounsel with him.  When she considered how wrongly he might take it\nall, it seemed as if it were already known to him, and she was\nimpatient to prevent his error.\n\nShe sent out for a messenger, whom she despatched with a note to his\nplace of business: \"Silas, I should like to ride with you this\nafternoon.  Can't you come home early? Persis.\" And she was at dinner\nwith Irene, evading her questions about Penelope, when answer came that\nhe would be at the house with the buggy at half-past two.  It is easy\nto put off a girl who has but one thing in her head; but though Mrs.\nLapham could escape without telling anything of Penelope, she could not\nescape seeing how wholly Irene was engrossed with hopes now turned so\nvain and impossible.  She was still talking of that dinner, of nothing\nbut that dinner, and begging for flattery of herself and praise of him,\nwhich her mother had till now been so ready to give.\n\n\"Seems to me you don't take very much interest, mamma!\" she said,\nlaughing and blushing at one point.\n\n\"Yes,--yes, I do,\" protested Mrs. Lapham, and then the girl prattled on.\n\n\"I guess I shall get one of those pins that Nanny Corey had in her\nhair.  I think it would become me, don't you?\" \"Yes; but Irene--I don't\nlike to have you go on so, till--unless he's said something to\nshow--You oughtn't to give yourself up to thinking----\" But at this the\ngirl turned so white, and looked such reproach at her, that she added\nfrantically: \"Yes, get the pin.  It is just the thing for you! But\ndon't disturb Penelope.  Let her alone till I get back.  I'm going out\nto ride with your father.  He'll be here in half an hour.  Are you\nthrough? Ring, then.  Get yourself that fan you saw the other day.\nYour father won't say anything; he likes to have you look well.  I\ncould see his eyes on you half the time the other night.\"\n\n\"I should have liked to have Pen go with me,\" said Irene, restored to\nher normal state of innocent selfishness by these flatteries.  \"Don't\nyou suppose she'll be up in time? What's the matter with her that she\ndidn't sleep?\"\n\n\"I don't know.  Better let her alone.\"\n\n\"Well,\" submitted Irene.\n\n\n\nXVIII.\n\n\nMRS.  LAPHAM went away to put on her bonnet and cloak, and she was\nwaiting at the window when her husband drove up.  She opened the door\nand ran down the steps.  \"Don't get out; I can help myself in,\" and she\nclambered to his side, while he kept the fidgeting mare still with\nvoice and touch.\n\n\"Where do you want I should go?\" he asked, turning the buggy.\n\n\"Oh, I don't care.  Out Brookline way, I guess.  I wish you hadn't\nbrought this fool of a horse,\" she gave way petulantly.  \"I wanted to\nhave a talk.\"\n\n\"When I can't drive this mare and talk too, I'll sell out altogether,\"\nsaid Lapham.  \"She'll be quiet enough when she's had her spin.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said his wife; and while they were making their way across the\ncity to the Milldam she answered certain questions he asked about some\npoints in the new house.\n\n\"I should have liked to have you stop there,\" he began; but she\nanswered so quickly, \"Not to-day,\" that he gave it up and turned his\nhorse's head westward when they struck Beacon Street.\n\nHe let the mare out, and he did not pull her in till he left the\nBrighton road and struck off under the low boughs that met above one of\nthe quiet streets of Brookline, where the stone cottages, with here and\nthere a patch of determined ivy on their northern walls, did what they\ncould to look English amid the glare of the autumnal foliage.  The\nsmooth earthen track under the mare's hoofs was scattered with flakes\nof the red and yellow gold that made the air luminous around them, and\nthe perspective was gay with innumerable tints and tones.\n\n\"Pretty sightly,\" said Lapham, with a long sigh, letting the reins lie\nloose in his vigilant hand, to which he seemed to relegate the whole\ncharge of the mare.  \"I want to talk with you about Rogers, Persis.\nHe's been getting in deeper and deeper with me; and last night he\npestered me half to death to go in with him in one of his schemes.  I\nain't going to blame anybody, but I hain't got very much confidence in\nRogers.  And I told him so last night.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't talk to me about Rogers!\" his wife broke in.  \"There's\nsomething a good deal more important than Rogers in the world, and more\nimportant than your business.  It seems as if you couldn't think of\nanything else--that and the new house.  Did you suppose I wanted to\nride so as to talk Rogers with you?\" she demanded, yielding to the\nnecessity a wife feels of making her husband pay for her suffering,\neven if he has not inflicted it.  \"I declare----\"\n\n\"Well, hold on, now!\" said Lapham.  \"What DO you want to talk about?\nI'm listening.\"\n\nHis wife began, \"Why, it's just this, Silas Lapham!\" and then she broke\noff to say, \"Well, you may wait, now--starting me wrong, when it's hard\nenough anyway.\"\n\nLapham silently turned his whip over and over in his hand and waited.\n\n\"Did you suppose,\" she asked at last, \"that that young Corey had been\ncoming to see Irene?\"\n\n\"I don't know what I supposed,\" replied Lapham sullenly.  \"You always\nsaid so.\" He looked sharply at her under his lowering brows.\n\n\"Well, he hasn't,\" said Mrs. Lapham; and she replied to the frown that\nblackened on her husband's face.  \"And I can tell you what, if you take\nit in that way I shan't speak another word.\"\n\n\"Who's takin' it what way?\" retorted Lapham savagely.  \"What are you\ndrivin' at?\"\n\n\"I want you should promise that you'll hear me out quietly.\"\n\n\"I'll hear you out if you'll give me a chance.  I haven't said a word\nyet.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm not going to have you flying into forty furies, and looking\nlike a perfect thunder-cloud at the very start.  I've had to bear it,\nand you've got to bear it too.\"\n\n\"Well, let me have a chance at it, then.\"\n\n\"It's nothing to blame anybody about, as I can see, and the only\nquestion is, what's the best thing to do about it.  There's only one\nthing we can do; for if he don't care for the child, nobody wants to\nmake him.  If he hasn't been coming to see her, he hasn't, and that's\nall there is to it.\"\n\n\"No, it ain't!\" exclaimed Lapham.\n\n\"There!\" protested his wife.\n\n\"If he hasn't been coming to see her, what HAS he been coming for?\"\n\n\"He's been coming to see Pen!\" cried the wife.  \"NOW are you\nsatisfied?\" Her tone implied that he had brought it all upon them; but\nat the sight of the swift passions working in his face to a perfect\ncomprehension of the whole trouble, she fell to trembling, and her\nbroken voice lost all the spurious indignation she had put into it.  \"O\nSilas! what are we going to do about it? I'm afraid it'll kill Irene.\"\n\nLapham pulled off the loose driving-glove from his right hand with the\nfingers of his left, in which the reins lay.  He passed it over his\nforehead, and then flicked from it the moisture it had gathered there.\nHe caught his breath once or twice, like a man who meditates a struggle\nwith superior force and then remains passive in its grasp.\n\nHis wife felt the need of comforting him, as she had felt the need of\nafflicting him.  \"I don't say but what it can be made to come out all\nright in the end.  All I say is, I don't see my way clear yet.\"\n\n\"What makes you think he likes Pen?\" he asked quietly.\n\n\"He told her so last night, and she told me this morning.  Was he at\nthe office to-day?\"\n\n\"Yes, he was there.  I haven't been there much myself.  He didn't say\nanything to me.  Does Irene know?\"\n\n\"No; I left her getting ready to go out shopping.  She wants to get a\npin like the one Nanny Corey had on.\" \"O my Lord!\" groaned Lapham.\n\n\"It's been Pen from the start, I guess, or almost from the start.  I\ndon't say but what he was attracted some by Irene at the very first;\nbut I guess it's been Pen ever since he saw her; and we've taken up\nwith a notion, and blinded ourselves with it.  Time and again I've had\nmy doubts whether he cared for Irene any; but I declare to goodness,\nwhen he kept coming, I never hardly thought of Pen, and I couldn't help\nbelieving at last he DID care for Irene.  Did it ever strike you he\nmight be after Pen?\"\n\n\"No. I took what you said.  I supposed you knew.\"\n\n\"Do you blame me, Silas?\" she asked timidly.\n\n\"No. What's the use of blaming? We don't either of us want anything but\nthe children's good.  What's it all of it for, if it ain't for that?\nThat's what we've both slaved for all our lives.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know.  Plenty of people LOSE their children,\" she suggested.\n\n\"Yes, but that don't comfort me any.  I never was one to feel good\nbecause another man felt bad.  How would you have liked it if some one\nhad taken comfort because his boy lived when ours died? No, I can't do\nit.  And this is worse than death, someways.  That comes and it goes;\nbut this looks as if it was one of those things that had come to stay.\nThe way I look at it, there ain't any hope for anybody.  Suppose we\ndon't want Pen to have him; will that help Irene any, if he don't want\nher? Suppose we don't want to let him have either; does that help\neither!\"\n\n\"You talk,\" exclaimed Mrs. Lapham, \"as if our say was going to settle\nit.  Do you suppose that Penelope Lapham is a girl to take up with a\nfellow that her sister is in love with, and that she always thought was\nin love with her sister, and go off and be happy with him?  Don't you\nbelieve but what it would come back to her, as long as she breathed the\nbreath of life, how she'd teased her about him, as I've heard Pen tease\nIrene, and helped to make her think he was in love with her, by showing\nthat she thought so herself? It's ridiculous!\"\n\nLapham seemed quite beaten down by this argument.  His huge head hung\nforward over his breast; the reins lay loose in his moveless hand; the\nmare took her own way.  At last he lifted his face and shut his heavy\njaws.\n\n\"Well?\" quavered his wife.\n\n\"Well,\" he answered, \"if he wants her, and she wants him, I don't see\nwhat that's got to do with it.\" He looked straight forward, and not at\nhis wife.\n\nShe laid her hands on the reins.  \"Now, you stop right here, Silas\nLapham! If I thought that--if I really believed you could be willing to\nbreak that poor child's heart, and let Pen disgrace herself by marrying\na man that had as good as killed her sister, just because you wanted\nBromfield Corey's son for a son-in-law----\"\n\nLapham turned his face now, and gave her a look.  \"You had better NOT\nbelieve that, Persis! Get up!\" he called to the mare, without glancing\nat her, and she sprang forward.  \"I see you've got past being any use\nto yourself on this subject.\"\n\n\"Hello!\" shouted a voice in front of him.  \"Where the devil you goin'\nto?\"\n\n\"Do you want to KILL somebody!\" shrieked his wife.\n\nThere was a light crash, and the mare recoiled her length, and\nseparated their wheels from those of the open buggy in front which\nLapham had driven into.  He made his excuses to the occupant; and the\naccident relieved the tension of their feelings, and left them far from\nthe point of mutual injury which they had reached in their common\ntrouble and their unselfish will for their children's good.\n\nIt was Lapham who resumed the talk.  \"I'm afraid we can't either of us\nsee this thing in the right light.  We're too near to it.  I wish to\nthe Lord there was somebody to talk to about it.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said his wife; \"but there ain't anybody.\"\n\n\"Well, I dunno,\" suggested Lapham, after a moment; \"why not talk to the\nminister of your church? May be he could see some way out of it.\"\n\nMrs. Lapham shook her head hopelessly.  \"It wouldn't do.  I've never\ntaken up my connection with the church, and I don't feel as if I'd got\nany claim on him.\"\n\n\"If he's anything of a man, or anything of a preacher, you HAVE got a\nclaim on him,\" urged Lapham; and he spoiled his argument by adding,\n\"I've contributed enough MONEY to his church.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's nothing,\" said Mrs. Lapham.  \"I ain't well enough\nacquainted with Dr. Langworthy, or else I'm TOO well.  No; if I was to\nask any one, I should want to ask a total stranger.  But what's the\nuse, Si? Nobody could make us see it any different from what it is, and\nI don't know as I should want they should.\"\n\nIt blotted out the tender beauty of the day, and weighed down their\nhearts ever more heavily within them.  They ceased to talk of it a\nhundred times, and still came back to it.  They drove on and on.  It\nbegan to be late.  \"I guess we better go back, Si,\" said his wife; and\nas he turned without speaking, she pulled her veil down and began to\ncry softly behind it, with low little broken sobs.\n\nLapham started the mare up and drove swiftly homeward.  At last his\nwife stopped crying and began trying to find her pocket.  \"Here, take\nmine, Persis,\" he said kindly, offering her his handkerchief, and she\ntook it and dried her eyes with it.  \"There was one of those fellows\nthere the other night,\" he spoke again, when his wife leaned back\nagainst the cushions in peaceful despair, \"that I liked the looks of\nabout as well as any man I ever saw.  I guess he was a pretty good man.\nIt was that Mr. Sewell.\"\n\nHe looked at his wife, but she did not say anything.  \"Persis,\" he\nresumed, \"I can't bear to go back with nothing settled in our minds.  I\ncan't bear to let you.\"\n\n\"We must, Si,\" returned his wife, with gentle gratitude.  Lapham\ngroaned.  \"Where does he live?\" she asked.\n\n\"On Bolingbroke Street.  He gave me his number.\"\n\n\"Well, it wouldn't do any good.  What could he say to us?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know as he could say anything,\" said Lapham hopelessly;\nand neither of them said anything more till they crossed the Milldam\nand found themselves between the rows of city houses.\n\n\"Don't drive past the new house, Si,\" pleaded his wife.  \"I couldn't\nbear to see it.  Drive--drive up Bolingbroke Street.  We might as well\nsee where he DOES live.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Lapham.  He drove along slowly.  \"That's the place,\" he\nsaid finally, stopping the mare and pointing with his whip.\n\n\"It wouldn't do any good,\" said his wife, in a tone which he understood\nas well as he understood her words.  He turned the mare up to the\ncurbstone.\n\n\"You take the reins a minute,\" he said, handing them to his wife.\n\nHe got down and rang the bell, and waited till the door opened; then he\ncame back and lifted his wife out.  \"He's in,\" he said.\n\nHe got the hitching-weight from under the buggy-seat and made it fast\nto the mare's bit.\n\n\"Do you think she'll stand with that?\" asked Mrs. Lapham.\n\n\"I guess so.  If she don't, no matter.\"\n\n\"Ain't you afraid she'll take cold,\" she persisted, trying to make\ndelay.\n\n\"Let her!\" said Lapham.  He took his wife's trembling hand under his\narm, and drew her to the door.\n\n\"He'll think we're crazy,\" she murmured in her broken pride.\n\n\"Well, we ARE,\" said Lapham.  \"Tell him we'd like to see him alone a\nwhile,\" he said to the girl who was holding the door ajar for him, and\nshe showed him into the reception-room, which had been the Protestant\nconfessional for many burdened souls before their time, coming, as they\ndid, with the belief that they were bowed down with the only misery\nlike theirs in the universe; for each one of us must suffer long to\nhimself before he can learn that he is but one in a great community of\nwretchedness which has been pitilessly repeating itself from the\nfoundation of the world.\n\nThey were as loath to touch their trouble when the minister came in as\nif it were their disgrace; but Lapham did so at last, and, with a\nsimple dignity which he had wanted in his bungling and apologetic\napproaches, he laid the affair clearly before the minister's\ncompassionate and reverent eye.  He spared Corey's name, but he did not\npretend that it was not himself and his wife and their daughters who\nwere concerned.\n\n\"I don't know as I've got any right to trouble you with this thing,\" he\nsaid, in the moment while Sewell sat pondering the case, \"and I don't\nknow as I've got any warrant for doing it.  But, as I told my wife\nhere, there was something about you--I don't know whether it was\nanything you SAID exactly--that made me feel as if you could help us.\nI guess I didn't say so much as that to her; but that's the way I felt.\nAnd here we are.  And if it ain't all right.\"\n\n\"Surely,\" said Sewell, \"it's all right.  I thank you for coming--for\ntrusting your trouble to me.  A time comes to every one of us when we\ncan't help ourselves, and then we must get others to help us.  If\npeople turn to me at such a time, I feel sure that I was put into the\nworld for something--if nothing more than to give my pity, my sympathy.\"\n\nThe brotherly words, so plain, so sincere, had a welcome in them that\nthese poor outcasts of sorrow could not doubt.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Lapham huskily, and his wife began to wipe the tears again\nunder her veil.\n\nSewell remained silent, and they waited till he should speak.  \"We can\nbe of use to one another here, because we can always be wiser for some\none else than we can for ourselves.  We can see another's sins and\nerrors in a more merciful light--and that is always a fairer\nlight--than we can our own; and we can look more sanely at others'\nafflictions.\" He had addressed these words to Lapham; now he turned to\nhis wife.  \"If some one had come to you, Mrs. Lapham, in just this\nperplexity, what would you have thought?\"\n\n\"I don't know as I understand you,\" faltered Mrs. Lapham.\n\nSewell repeated his words, and added, \"I mean, what do you think some\none else ought to do in your place?\"\n\n\"Was there ever any poor creatures in such a strait before?\" she asked,\nwith pathetic incredulity.\n\n\"There's no new trouble under the sun,\" said the minister.\n\n\"Oh, if it was any one else, I should say--I should say--Why, of\ncourse! I should say that their duty was to let----\" She paused.\n\n\"One suffer instead of three, if none is to blame?\" suggested Sewell.\n\"That's sense, and that's justice.  It's the economy of pain which\nnaturally suggests itself, and which would insist upon itself, if we\nwere not all perverted by traditions which are the figment of the\nshallowest sentimentality.  Tell me, Mrs. Lapham, didn't this come into\nyour mind when you first learned how matters stood?\"\n\n\"Why, yes, it flashed across me.  But I didn't think it could be right.\"\n\n\"And how was it with you, Mr. Lapham?\"\n\n\"Why, that's what I thought, of course.  But I didn't see my way----\"\n\n\"No,\" cried the minister, \"we are all blinded, we are all weakened by a\nfalse ideal of self-sacrifice. It wraps us round with its meshes, and\nwe can't fight our way out of it.  Mrs. Lapham, what made you feel that\nit might be better for three to suffer than one?\"\n\n\"Why, she did herself.  I know she would die sooner than take him away\nfrom her.\"\n\n\"I supposed so!\" cried the minister bitterly.  \"And yet she is a\nsensible girl, your daughter?\"\n\n\"She has more common-sense----\"\n\n\"Of course! But in such a case we somehow think it must be wrong to use\nour common-sense. I don't know where this false ideal comes from,\nunless it comes from the novels that befool and debauch almost every\nintelligence in some degree.  It certainly doesn't come from\nChristianity, which instantly repudiates it when confronted with it.\nYour daughter believes, in spite of her common-sense, that she ought to\nmake herself and the man who loves her unhappy, in order to assure the\nlife-long wretchedness of her sister, whom he doesn't love, simply\nbecause her sister saw him and fancied him first! And I'm sorry to say\nthat ninety-nine young people out of a hundred--oh, nine hundred and\nninety-nine out of a thousand!--would consider that noble and beautiful\nand heroic; whereas you know at the bottom of your hearts that it would\nbe foolish and cruel and revolting.  You know what marriage is! And\nwhat it must be without love on both sides.\"\n\nThe minister had grown quite heated and red in the face.\n\n\"I lose all patience!\" he went on vehemently.  \"This poor child of\nyours has somehow been brought to believe that it will kill her sister\nif her sister does not have what does not belong to her, and what it is\nnot in the power of all the world, or any soul in the world, to give\nher.  Her sister will suffer--yes, keenly!--in heart and in pride; but\nshe will not die.  You will suffer too, in your tenderness for her; but\nyou must do your duty.  You must help her to give up.  You would be\nguilty if you did less.  Keep clearly in mind that you are doing right,\nand the only possible good.  And God be with you!\"\n\n\n\nXIX.\n\n\n\"HE talked sense, Persis,\" said Lapham gently, as he mounted to his\nwife's side in the buggy and drove slowly homeward through the dusk.\n\n\"Yes, he talked sense,\" she admitted.  But she added bitterly, \"I\nguess, if he had it to DO! Oh, he's right, and it's got to be done.\nThere ain't any other way for it.  It's sense; and, yes, it's justice.\"\nThey walked to their door after they left the horse at the livery\nstable around the corner, where Lapham kept it.  \"I want you should\nsend Irene up to our room as soon as we get in, Silas.\"\n\n\"Why, ain't you going to have any supper first?\" faltered Lapham with\nhis latch-key in the lock.\n\n\"No. I can't lose a minute.  If I do, I shan't do it at all.\"\n\n\"Look here, Persis,\" said her husband tenderly, \"let me do this thing.\"\n\n\"Oh, YOU!\" said his wife, with a woman's compassionate scorn for a\nman's helplessness in such a case.  \"Send her right up.  And I shall\nfeel----\" She stopped to spare him.\n\nThen she opened the door, and ran up to her room without waiting to\nspeak to Irene, who had come into the hall at the sound of her father's\nkey in the door.\n\n\"I guess your mother wants to see you upstairs,\" said Lapham, looking\naway.\n\nHer mother turned round and faced the girl's wondering look as Irene\nentered the chamber, so close upon her that she had not yet had time to\nlay off her bonnet; she stood with her wraps still on her arm.\n\n\"Irene!\" she said harshly, \"there is something you have got to bear.\nIt's a mistake we've all made.  He don't care anything for you.  He\nnever did.  He told Pen so last night.  He cares for her.\"\n\nThe sentences had fallen like blows.  But the girl had taken them\nwithout flinching.  She stood up immovable, but the delicate rose-light\nof her complexion went out and left her colourless.  She did not offer\nto speak.\n\n\"Why don't you say something?\" cried her mother.  \"Do you want to kill\nme, Irene?\"\n\n\"Why should I want to hurt you, mamma?\" the girl replied steadily, but\nin an alien voice.  \"There's nothing to say.  I want to see Pen a\nminute.\"\n\nShe turned and left the room.  As she mounted the stairs that led to\nher own and her sister's rooms on the floor above, her mother\nhelplessly followed.  Irene went first to her own room at the front of\nthe house, and then came out leaving the door open and the gas flaring\nbehind her.  The mother could see that she had tumbled many things out\nof the drawers of her bureau upon the marble top.\n\nShe passed her mother, where she stood in the entry.  \"You can come\ntoo, if you want to, mamma,\" she said.\n\nShe opened Penelope's door without knocking, and went in.  Penelope sat\nat the window, as in the morning.  Irene did not go to her; but she\nwent and laid a gold hair-pin on her bureau, and said, without looking\nat her, \"There's a pin that I got to-day, because it was like his\nsister's. It won't become a dark person so well, but you can have it.\"\n\nShe stuck a scrap of paper in the side of Penelope's mirror.  \"There's\nthat account of Mr. Stanton's ranch.  You'll want to read it, I\npresume.\"\n\nShe laid a withered boutonniere on the bureau beside the pin.  \"There's\nhis button-hole bouquet.  He left it by his plate, and I stole it.\"\n\nShe had a pine-shaving fantastically tied up with a knot of ribbon, in\nher hand.  She held it a moment; then, looking deliberately at\nPenelope, she went up to her, and dropped it in her lap without a word.\nShe turned, and, advancing a few steps, tottered and seemed about to\nfall.\n\nHer mother sprang forward with an imploring cry, \"O 'Rene, 'Rene,\n'Rene!\"\n\nIrene recovered herself before her mother could reach her.  \"Don't\ntouch me,\" she said icily.  \"Mamma, I'm going to put on my things.  I\nwant papa to walk with me.  I'm choking here.\"\n\n\"I--I can't let you go out, Irene, child,\" began her mother.\n\n\"You've got to,\" replied the girl.  \"Tell papa ta hurry his supper.\"\n\n\"O poor soul! He doesn't want any supper.  HE knows it too.\"\n\n\"I don't want to talk about that.  Tell him to get ready.\"\n\nShe left them once more.\n\nMrs. Lapham turned a hapless glance upon Penelope.\n\n\"Go and tell him, mother,\" said the girl.  \"I would, if I could.  If\nshe can walk, let her.  It's the only thing for her.\" She sat still;\nshe did not even brush to the floor the fantastic thing that lay in her\nlap, and that sent up faintly the odour of the sachet powder with which\nIrene liked to perfume her boxes.\n\nLapham went out with the unhappy child, and began to talk with her,\ncrazily, incoherently, enough.\n\nShe mercifully stopped him.  \"Don't talk, papa.  I don't want any one\nshould talk with me.\"\n\nHe obeyed, and they walked silently on and on.  In their aimless course\nthey reached the new house on the water side of Beacon, and she made\nhim stop, and stood looking up at it.  The scaffolding which had so\nlong defaced the front was gone, and in the light of the gas-lamp\nbefore it all the architectural beauty of the facade was suggested, and\nmuch of the finely felt detail was revealed.  Seymour had pretty nearly\nsatisfied himself in that rich facade; certainly Lapham had not stinted\nhim of the means.\n\n\"Well,\" said the girl, \"I shall never live in it,\" and she began to\nwalk on.\n\nLapham's sore heart went down, as he lumbered heavily after her.  \"Oh\nyes, you will, Irene.  You'll have lots of good times there yet.\"\n\n\"No,\" she answered, and said nothing more about it.  They had not\ntalked of their trouble at all, and they did not speak of it now.\nLapham understood that she was trying to walk herself weary, and he was\nglad to hold his peace and let her have her way.  She halted him once\nmore before the red and yellow lights of an apothecary's window.\n\n\"Isn't there something they give you to make you sleep?\" she asked\nvaguely.  \"I've got to sleep to-night!\"\n\nLapham trembled.  \"I guess you don't want anything, Irene.\"\n\n\"Yes, I do! Get me something!\" she retorted wilfully.  \"If you don't, I\nshall die.  I MUST sleep.\"\n\nThey went in, and Lapham asked for something to make a nervous person\nsleep.  Irene stood poring over the show-case full of brushes and\ntrinkets, while the apothecary put up the bromide, which he guessed\nwould be about the best thing.  She did not show any emotion; her face\nwas like a stone, while her father's expressed the anguish of his\nsympathy.  He looked as if he had not slept for a week; his fat eyelids\ndrooped over his glassy eyes, and his cheeks and throat hung flaccid.\nHe started as the apothecary's cat stole smoothly up and rubbed itself\nagainst his leg; and it was to him that the man said, \"You want to take\na table-spoonful of that, as long as you're awake.  I guess it won't\ntake a great many to fetch you.\" \"All right,\" said Lapham, and paid and\nwent out.  \"I don't know but I SHALL want some of it,\" he said, with a\njoyless laugh.\n\nIrene came closer up to him and took his arm.  He laid his heavy paw on\nher gloved fingers.  After a while she said, \"I want you should let me\ngo up to Lapham to-morrow.\"\n\n\"To Lapham? Why, to-morrow's Sunday, Irene! You can't go to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Well, Monday, then.  I can live through one day here.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the father passively.  He made no pretence of asking her\nwhy she wished to go, nor any attempt to dissuade her.\n\n\"Give me that bottle,\" she said, when he opened the door at home for\nher, and she ran up to her own room.\n\nThe next morning Irene came to breakfast with her mother; the Colonel\nand Penelope did not appear, and Mrs. Lapham looked sleep-broken and\ncareworn.\n\nThe girl glanced at her.  \"Don't you fret about me, mamma,\" she said.\n\"I shall get along.\" She seemed herself as steady and strong as rock.\n\n\"I don't like to see you keeping up so, Irene,\" replied her mother.\n\"It'll be all the worse for you when you do break.  Better give way a\nlittle at the start.\"\n\n\"I shan't break, and I've given way all I'm going to.  I'm going to\nLapham to-morrow,--I want you should go with me, mamma,--and I guess I\ncan keep up one day here.  All about it is, I don't want you should say\nanything, or LOOK anything.  And, whatever I do, I don't want you\nshould try to stop me.  And, the first thing, I'm going to take her\nbreakfast up to her.  Don't!\" she cried, intercepting the protest on\nher mother's lips.  \"I shall not let it hurt Pen, if I can help it.\nShe's never done a thing nor thought a thing to wrong me.  I had to fly\nout at her last night; but that's all over now, and I know just what\nI've got to bear.\"\n\nShe had her way unmolested.  She carried Penelope's breakfast to her,\nand omitted no care or attention that could make the sacrifice\ncomplete, with an heroic pretence that she was performing no unusual\nservice.  They did not speak, beyond her saying, in a clear dry note,\n\"Here's your breakfast, Pen,\" and her sister's answering, hoarsely and\ntremulously, \"Oh, thank you, Irene.\" And, though two or three times\nthey turned their faces toward each other while Irene remained in the\nroom, mechanically putting its confusion to rights, their eyes did not\nmeet.  Then Irene descended upon the other rooms, which she set in\norder, and some of which she fiercely swept and dusted.  She made the\nbeds; and she sent the two servants away to church as soon as they had\neaten their breakfast, telling them that she would wash their dishes.\nThroughout the morning her father and mother heard her about the work\nof getting dinner, with certain silences which represented the moments\nwhen she stopped and stood stock-still, and then, readjusting her\nburden, forced herself forward under it again.\n\nThey sat alone in the family room, out of which their two girls seemed\nto have died.  Lapham could not read his Sunday papers, and she had no\nheart to go to church, as she would have done earlier in life when in\ntrouble.  Just then she was obscurely feeling that the church was\nsomehow to blame for that counsel of Mr. Sewell's on which they had\nacted.\n\n\"I should like to know,\" she said, having brought the matter up,\n\"whether he would have thought it was such a light matter if it had\nbeen his own children.  Do you suppose he'd have been so ready to act\non his own advice if it HAD been?\"\n\n\"He told us the right thing to do, Persis,--the only thing.  We\ncouldn't let it go on,\" urged her husband gently.\n\n\"Well, it makes me despise Pen! Irene's showing twice the character\nthat she is, this very minute.\"\n\nThe mother said this so that the father might defend her daughter to\nher.  He did not fail.  \"Irene's got the easiest part, the way I look\nat it.  And you'll see that Pen'll know how to behave when the time\ncomes.\"\n\n\"What do you want she should do?\"\n\n\"I haven't got so far as that yet.  What are we going to do about\nIrene?\"\n\n\"What do you want Pen should do,\" repeated Mrs. Lapham, \"when it comes\nto it?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't want she should take him, for ONE thing,\" said Lapham.\n\nThis seemed to satisfy Mrs. Lapham as to her husband, and she said in\ndefence of Corey, \"Why, I don't see what HE'S done.  It's all been our\ndoing.\"\n\n\"Never mind that now.  What about Irene?\"\n\n\"She says she's going to Lapham to-morrow. She feels that she's got to\nget away somewhere.  It's natural she should.\"\n\n\"Yes, and I presume it will be about the best thing FOR her.  Shall you\ngo with her?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well.\" He comfortlessly took up a newspaper again, and she rose with a\nsigh, and went to her room to pack some things for the morrow's journey.\n\nAfter dinner, when Irene had cleared away the last trace of it in\nkitchen and dining-room with unsparing punctilio, she came downstairs,\ndressed to go out, and bade her father come to walk with her again.  It\nwas a repetition of the aimlessness of the last night's wanderings.\nThey came back, and she got tea for them, and after that they heard her\nstirring about in her own room, as if she were busy about many things;\nbut they did not dare to look in upon her, even after all the noises\nhad ceased, and they knew she had gone to bed.\n\n\"Yes; it's a thing she's got to fight out by herself,\" said Mrs Lapham.\n\n\"I guess she'll get along,\" said Lapham.  \"But I don't want you should\nmisjudge Pen either.  She's all right too.  She ain't to blame.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know.  But I can't work round to it all at once.  I shan't\nmisjudge her, but you can't expect me to get over it right away.\"\n\n\"Mamma,\" said Irene, when she was hurrying their departure the next\nmorning, \"what did she tell him when he asked her?\"\n\n\"Tell him?\" echoed the mother; and after a while she added, \"She didn't\ntell him anything.\"\n\n\"Did she say anything, about me?\"\n\n\"She said he mustn't come here any more.\"\n\nIrene turned and went into her sister's room.  \"Good-bye, Pen,\" she\nsaid, kissing her with an effect of not seeing or touching her.  \"I\nwant you should tell him all about it.  If he's half a man, he won't\ngive up till he knows why you won't have him; and he has a right to\nknow.\"\n\n\"It wouldn't make any difference.  I couldn't have him after----\"\n\n\"That's for you to say.  But if you don't tell him about me, I will.\"\n\n\"'Rene!\" \"Yes! You needn't say I cared for him.  But you can say that\nyou all thought he--cared for--me.\"\n\n\"O Irene----\"\n\n\"Don't!\" Irene escaped from the arms that tried to cast themselves\nabout her.  \"You are all right, Pen.  You haven't done anything.\nYou've helped me all you could.  But I can't--yet.\"\n\nShe went out of the room and summoned Mrs. Lapham with a sharp \"Now,\nmamma!\" and went on putting the last things into her trunks.\n\nThe Colonel went to the station with them, and put them on the train.\nHe got them a little compartment to themselves in the Pullman car; and\nas he stood leaning with his lifted hands against the sides of the\ndoorway, he tried to say something consoling and hopeful: \"I guess\nyou'll have an easy ride, Irene.  I don't believe it'll be dusty, any,\nafter the rain last night.\"\n\n\"Don't you stay till the train starts, papa,\" returned the girl, in\nrigid rejection of his futilities.  \"Get off, now.\"\n\n\"Well, if you want I should,\" he said, glad to be able to please her in\nanything.  He remained on the platform till the cars started.  He saw\nIrene bustling about in the compartment, making her mother comfortable\nfor the journey; but Mrs. Lapham did not lift her head.  The train\nmoved off, and he went heavily back to his business.\n\nFrom time to time during the day, when he caught a glimpse of him,\nCorey tried to make out from his face whether he knew what had taken\nplace between him and Penelope.  When Rogers came in about time of\nclosing, and shut himself up with Lapham in his room, the young man\nremained till the two came out together and parted in their\nsalutationless fashion.\n\nLapham showed no surprise at seeing Corey still there, and merely\nanswered, \"Well!\" when the young man said that he wished to speak with\nhim, and led the way back to his room.\n\nCorey shut the door behind them.  \"I only wish to speak to you in case\nyou know of the matter already; for otherwise I'm bound by a promise.\"\n\n\"I guess I know what you mean.  It's about Penelope.\"\n\n\"Yes, it's about Miss Lapham.  I am greatly attached to her--you'll\nexcuse my saying it; I couldn't excuse myself if I were not.\"\n\n\"Perfectly excusable,\" said Lapham.  \"It's all right.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm glad to hear you say that!\" cried the young fellow joyfully.\n\"I want you to believe that this isn't a new thing or an unconsidered\nthing with me--though it seemed so unexpected to her.\"\n\nLapham fetched a deep sigh.  \"It's all right as far as I'm\nconcerned--or her mother.  We've both liked you first-rate.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"But there seems to be something in Penelope's mind--I don't know--\"\nThe Colonel consciously dropped his eyes.\n\n\"She referred to something--I couldn't make out what--but I hoped--I\nhoped--that with your leave I might overcome it--the barrier--whatever\nit was.  Miss Lapham--Penelope--gave me the hope--that I\nwas--wasn't--indifferent to her----\"\n\n\"Yes, I guess that's so,\" said Lapham.  He suddenly lifted his head,\nand confronted the young fellow's honest face with his own face, so\ndifferent in its honesty.  \"Sure you never made up to any one else at\nthe same time?\"\n\n\"NEVER! Who could imagine such a thing? If that's all, I can easily.\"\n\n\"I don't say that's all, nor that that's it.  I don't want you should\ngo upon that idea.  I just thought, may be--you hadn't thought of it.\"\n\n\"No, I certainly hadn't thought of it! Such a thing would have been so\nimpossible to me that I couldn't have thought of it; and it's so\nshocking to me now that I don't know what to say to it.\"\n\n\"Well, don't take it too much to heart,\" said Lapham, alarmed at the\nfeeling he had excited; \"I don't say she thought so.  I was trying to\nguess--trying to----\"\n\n\"If there is anything I can say or do to convince you----\"\n\n\"Oh, it ain't necessary to say anything.  I'm all right.\"\n\n\"But Miss Lapham! I may see her again? I may try to convince her\nthat----\"\n\nHe stopped in distress, and Lapham afterwards told his wife that he\nkept seeing the face of Irene as it looked when he parted with her in\nthe car; and whenever he was going to say yes, he could not open his\nlips.  At the same time he could not help feeling that Penelope had a\nright to what was her own, and Sewell's words came back to him.\nBesides, they had already put Irene to the worst suffering.  Lapham\ncompromised, as he imagined.  \"You can come round to-night and see ME,\nif you want to,\" he said; and he bore grimly the gratitude that the\nyoung man poured out upon him.\n\nPenelope came down to supper and took her mother's place at the head of\nthe table.\n\nLapham sat silent in her presence as long as he could bear it.  Then he\nasked, \"How do you feel to-night, Pen?\"\n\n\"Oh, like a thief,\" said the girl.  \"A thief that hasn't been arrested\nyet.\"\n\nLapham waited a while before he said, \"Well, now, your mother and I\nwant you should hold up on that a while.\"\n\n\"It isn't for you to say.  It's something I can't hold up on.\"\n\n\"Yes, I guess you can.  If I know what's happened, then what's happened\nis a thing that nobody is to blame for.  And we want you should make\nthe best of it and not the worst.  Heigh? It ain't going to help Irene\nany for you to hurt yourself--or anybody else; and I don't want you\nshould take up with any such crazy notion.  As far as heard from, you\nhaven't stolen anything, and whatever you've got belongs to you.\"\n\n\"Has he been speaking to you, father?\"\n\n\"Your mother's been speaking to me.\"\n\n\"Has HE been speaking to you?\"\n\n\"That's neither here nor there.\"\n\n\"Then he's broken his word, and I will never speak to him again!\"\n\n\"If he was any such fool as to promise that he wouldn't talk to me on a\nsubject\"--Lapham drew a deep breath, and then made the plunge--\"that I\nbrought up----\"\n\n\"Did you bring it up?\"\n\n\"The same as brought up--the quicker he broke his word the better; and\nI want you should act upon that idea.  Recollect that it's my business,\nand your mother's business, as well as yours, and we're going to have\nour say.  He hain't done anything wrong, Pen, nor anything that he's\ngoing to be punished for.  Understand that.  He's got to have a reason,\nif you're not going to have him.  I don't say you've got to have him; I\nwant you should feel perfectly free about that; but I DO say you've got\nto give him a reason.\"\n\n\"Is he coming here?\"\n\n\"I don't know as you'd call it COMING----\"\n\n\"Yes, you do, father!\" said the girl, in forlorn amusement at his\nshuffling.\n\n\"He's coming here to see ME----\"\n\n\"When's he coming?\"\n\n\"I don't know but he's coming to-night.\"\n\n\"And you want I should see him?\"\n\n\"I don't know but you'd better.\"\n\n\"All right.  I'll see him.\"\n\nLapham drew a long deep breath of suspicion inspired by this\nacquiescence.  \"What you going to do?\" he asked presently.\n\n\"I don't know yet,\" answered the girl sadly.  \"It depends a good deal\nupon what he does.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Lapham, with the hungriness of unsatisfied anxiety in his\ntone.  When Corey's card was brought into the family-room where he and\nPenelope were sitting, he went into the parlour to find him.  \"I guess\nPenelope wants to see you,\" he said; and, indicating the family-room,\nhe added, \"She's in there,\" and did not go back himself.\n\nCorey made his way to the girl's presence with open trepidation, which\nwas not allayed by her silence and languor.  She sat in the chair where\nshe had sat the other night, but she was not playing with a fan now.\n\nHe came toward her, and then stood faltering.  A faint smile quivered\nover her face at the spectacle of his subjection.  \"Sit down, Mr.\nCorey,\" she said.  \"There's no reason why we shouldn't talk it over\nquietly; for I know you will think I'm right.\"\n\n\"I'm sure of that,\" he answered hopefully.  \"When I saw that your\nfather knew of it to-day, I asked him to let me see you again.  I'm\nafraid that I broke my promise to you--technically----\"\n\n\"It had to be broken.\" He took more courage at her words.  \"But I've\nonly come to do whatever you say, and not to be an--annoyance to\nyou----\"\n\n\"Yes, you have to know; but I couldn't tell you before.  Now they all\nthink I should.\"\n\nA tremor of anxiety passed over the young man's face, on which she kept\nher eyes steadily fixed.\n\n\"We supposed it--it was--Irene----\"\n\nHe remained blank a moment, and then he said with a smile of relief, of\ndeprecation, of protest, of amazement, of compassion--\n\n\"OH! Never! Never for an instant! How could you think such a thing? It\nwas impossible! I never thought of her.  But I see--I see! I can\nexplain--no, there's nothing to explain! I have never knowingly done or\nsaid a thing from first to last to make you think that.  I see how\nterrible it is!\" he said; but he still smiled, as if he could not take\nit seriously.  \"I admired her beauty--who could help doing that?--and I\nthought her very good and sensible.  Why, last winter in Texas, I told\nStanton about our meeting in Canada, and we agreed--I only tell you to\nshow you how far I always was from what you thought--that he must come\nNorth and try to see her, and--and--of course, it all sounds very\nsilly!--and he sent her a newspaper with an account of his ranch in\nit----\"\n\n\"She thought it came from you.\"\n\n\"Oh, good heavens! He didn't tell me till after he'd done it.  But he\ndid it for a part of our foolish joke.  And when I met your sister\nagain, I only admired her as before.  I can see, now, how I must have\nseemed to be seeking her out; but it was to talk of you with her--I\nnever talked of anything else if I could help it, except when I changed\nthe subject because I was ashamed to be always talking of you.  I see\nhow distressing it is for all of you.  But tell me that you believe me!\"\n\n\"Yes, I must.  It's all been our mistake----\"\n\n\"It has indeed! But there's no mistake about my loving you, Penelope,\"\nhe said; and the old-fashioned name, at which she had often mocked, was\nsweet to her from his lips.\n\n\"That only makes it worse!\" she answered.\n\n\"Oh no!\" he gently protested.  \"It makes it better.  It makes it right.\nHow is it worse? How is it wrong?\"\n\n\"Can't you see? You must understand all now! Don't you see that if she\nbelieved so too, and if she----\" She could not go on.\n\n\"Did she--did your sister--think that too?\" gasped Corey.\n\n\"She used to talk with me about you; and when you say you care for me\nnow, it makes me feel like the vilest hypocrite in the world.  That day\nyou gave her the list of books, and she came down to Nantasket, and\nwent on about you, I helped her to flatter herself--oh! I don't see how\nshe can forgive me.  But she knows I can never forgive myself! That's\nthe reason she can do it.  I can see now,\" she went on, \"how I must\nhave been trying to get you from her.  I can't endure it! The only way\nis for me never to see you or speak to you again!\" She laughed\nforlornly.  \"That would be pretty hard on you, if you cared.\"\n\n\"I do care--all the world!\"\n\n\"Well, then, it would if you were going to keep on caring.  You won't\nlong, if you stop coming now.\"\n\n\"Is this all, then? Is it the end?\"\n\n\"It's--whatever it is.  I can't get over the thought of her.  Once I\nthought I could, but now I see that I can't. It seems to grow worse.\nSometimes I feel as if it would drive me crazy.\"\n\nHe sat looking at her with lacklustre eyes.  The light suddenly came\nback into them.  \"Do you think I could love you if you had been false\nto her? I know you have been true to her, and truer still to yourself.\nI never tried to see her, except with the hope of seeing you too.  I\nsupposed she must know that I was in love with you.  From the first\ntime I saw you there that afternoon, you filled my fancy.  Do you think\nI was flirting with the child, or--no, you don't think that! We have\nnot done wrong.  We have not harmed any one knowingly.  We have a right\nto each other----\"\n\n\"No! no! you must never speak to me of this again.  If you do, I shall\nknow that you despise me.\"\n\n\"But how will that help her? I don't love HER.\"\n\n\"Don't say that to me! I have said that to myself too much.\"\n\n\"If you forbid me to love you, it won't make me love her,\" he persisted.\n\nShe was about to speak, but she caught her breath without doing so, and\nmerely stared at him.  \"I must do what you say,\" he continued.  \"But\nwhat good will it do her? You can't make her happy by making yourself\nunhappy.\"\n\n\"Do you ask me to profit by a wrong?\"\n\n\"Not for the world.  But there is no wrong!\"\n\n\"There is something--I don't know what.  There's a wall between us.  I\nshall dash myself against it as long as I live; but that won't break\nit.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" he groaned.  \"We have done no wrong.  Why should we suffer from\nanother's mistake as if it were our sin?\"\n\n\"I don't know.  But we must suffer.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I WILL not, for my part, and I will not let you.  If you\ncare for me----\"\n\n\"You had no right to know it.\"\n\n\"You make it my privilege to keep you from doing wrong for the right's\nsake.  I'm sorry, with all my heart and soul, for this error; but I\ncan't blame myself, and I won't deny myself the happiness I haven't\ndone anything to forfeit.  I will never give you up.  I will wait as\nlong as you please for the time when you shall feel free from this\nmistake; but you shall be mine at last.  Remember that.  I might go\naway for months--a year, even; but that seems a cowardly and guilty\nthing, and I'm not afraid, and I'm not guilty, and I'm going to stay\nhere and try to see you.\"\n\nShe shook her head.  \"It won't change anything? Don't you see that\nthere's no hope for us?\"\n\n\"When is she coming back?\" he asked.\n\n\"I don't know.  Mother wants father to come and take her out West for a\nwhile.\"\n\n\"She's up there in the country with your mother yet?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nHe was silent; then he said desperately--\n\n\"Penelope, she is very young; and perhaps--perhaps she might meet----\"\n\n\"It would make no difference.  It wouldn't change it for me.\"\n\n\"You are cruel--cruel to yourself, if you love me, and cruel to me.\nDon't you remember that night--before I spoke--you were talking of that\nbook; and you said it was foolish and wicked to do as that girl did.\nWhy is it different with you, except that you give me nothing, and can\nnever give me anything when you take yourself away?  If it were anybody\nelse, I am sure you would say----\"\n\n\"But it isn't anybody else, and that makes it impossible.  Sometimes I\nthink it might be if I would only say so to myself, and then all that I\nsaid to her about you comes up----\"\n\n\"I will wait.  It can't always come up.  I won't urge you any longer\nnow.  But you will see it differently--more clearly.  Good-bye--no!\nGood night! I shall come again to-morrow. It will surely come right,\nand, whatever happens, you have done no wrong.  Try to keep that in\nmind.  I am so happy, in spite of all!\"\n\nHe tried to take her hand, but she put it behind her.  \"No, no! I can't\nlet you--yet!\"\n\n\n\nXX.\n\n\nAFTER a week Mrs. Lapham returned, leaving Irene alone at the old\nhomestead in Vermont.  \"She's comfortable there--as comfortable as she\ncan be anywheres, I guess,\" she said to her husband as they drove\ntogether from the station, where he had met her in obedience to her\ntelegraphic summons.  \"She keeps herself busy helping about the house;\nand she goes round amongst the hands in their houses.  There's\nsickness, and you know how helpful she is where there's sickness.  She\ndon't complain any.  I don't know as I've heard a word out of her mouth\nsince we left home; but I'm afraid it'll wear on her, Silas.\"\n\n\"You don't look over and above well yourself, Persis,\" said her husband\nkindly.\n\n\"Oh, don't talk about me.  What I want to know is whether you can't get\nthe time to run off with her somewhere.  I wrote to you about Dubuque.\nShe'll work herself down, I'm afraid; and THEN I don't know as she'll\nbe over it.  But if she could go off, and be amused--see new people----\"\n\n\"I could MAKE the time,\" said Lapham, \"if I had to.  But, as it\nhappens, I've got to go out West on business,--I'll tell you about\nit,--and I'll take Irene along.\"\n\n\"Good!\" said his wife.  \"That's about the best thing I've heard yet.\nWhere you going?\"\n\n\"Out Dubuque way.\"\n\n\"Anything the matter with Bill's folks?\"\n\n\"No. It's business.\"\n\n\"How's Pen?\"\n\n\"I guess she ain't much better than Irene.\"\n\n\"He been about any?\"\n\n\"Yes. But I can't see as it helps matters much.\"\n\n\"Tchk!\" Mrs. Lapham fell back against the carriage cushions.  \"I\ndeclare, to see her willing to take the man that we all thought wanted\nher sister! I can't make it seem right.\"\n\n\"It's right,\" said Lapham stoutly; \"but I guess she ain't willing; I\nwish she was.  But there don't seem to be any way out of the thing,\nanywhere.  It's a perfect snarl.  But I don't want you should be\nanyways ha'sh with Pen.\"\n\nMrs. Lapham answered nothing; but when she met Penelope she gave the\ngirl's wan face a sharp look, and began to whimper on her neck.\n\nPenelope's tears were all spent.  \"Well, mother,\" she said, \"you come\nback almost as cheerful as you went away.  I needn't ask if 'Rene's in\ngood spirits.  We all seem to be overflowing with them.  I suppose this\nis one way of congratulating me.  Mrs. Corey hasn't been round to do it\nyet.\"\n\n\"Are you--are you engaged to him, Pen?\" gasped her mother.\n\n\"Judging by my feelings, I should say not.  I feel as if it was a last\nwill and testament.  But you'd better ask him when he comes.\"\n\n\"I can't bear to look at him.\"\n\n\"I guess he's used to that.  He don't seem to expect to be looked at.\nWell! we're all just where we started.  I wonder how long it will keep\nup.\"\n\nMrs. Lapham reported to her husband when he came home at night--he had\nleft his business to go and meet her, and then, after a desolate dinner\nat the house, had returned to the office again--that Penelope was fully\nas bad as Irene.  \"And she don't know how to work it off.  Irene keeps\ndoing; but Pen just sits in her room and mopes.  She don't even read.\nI went up this afternoon to scold her about the state the house was\nin--you can see that Irene's away by the perfect mess; but when I saw\nher through the crack of the door I hadn't the heart.  She sat there\nwith her hands in her lap, just staring.  And, my goodness! she JUMPED\nso when she saw me; and then she fell back, and began to laugh, and\nsaid she, 'I thought it was my ghost, mother!' I felt as if I should\ngive way.\"\n\nLapham listened jadedly, and answered far from the point.  \"I guess\nI've got to start out there pretty soon, Persis.\"\n\n\"How soon?\"\n\n\"Well, to-morrow morning.\"\n\nMrs. Lapham sat silent.  Then, \"All right,\" she said.  \"I'll get you\nready.\"\n\n\"I shall run up to Lapham for Irene, and then I'll push on through\nCanada.  I can get there about as quick.\"\n\n\"Is it anything you can tell me about, Silas?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Lapham.  \"But it's a long story, and I guess you've got\nyour hands pretty full as it is.  I've been throwing good money after\nbad,--the usual way,--and now I've got to see if I can save the\npieces.\"\n\nAfter a moment Mrs. Lapham asked, \"Is it--Rogers?\"\n\n\"It's Rogers.\"\n\n\"I didn't want you should get in any deeper with him.\"\n\n\"No. You didn't want I should press him either; and I had to do one or\nthe other.  And so I got in deeper.\"\n\n\"Silas,\" said his wife, \"I'm afraid I made you!\"\n\n\"It's all right, Persis, as far forth as that goes.  I was glad to make\nit up with him--I jumped at the chance.  I guess Rogers saw that he had\na soft thing in me, and he's worked it for all it was worth.  But it'll\nall come out right in the end.\"\n\nLapham said this as if he did not care to talk any more about it.  He\nadded casually, \"Pretty near everybody but the fellows that owe ME seem\nto expect me to do a cash business, all of a sudden.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that you've got payments to make, and that people are not\npaying YOU?\"\n\nLapham winced a little.  \"Something like that,\" he said, and he lighted\na cigar.  \"But when I tell you it's all right, I mean it, Persis.  I\nain't going to let the grass grow under my feet, though,--especially\nwhile Rogers digs the ground away from the roots.\"\n\n\"What are you going to do?\"\n\n\"If it has to come to that, I'm going to squeeze him.\" Lapham's\ncountenance lighted up with greater joy than had yet visited it since\nthe day they had driven out to Brookline.  \"Milton K. Rogers is a\nrascal, if you want to know; or else all the signs fail.  But I guess\nhe'll find he's got his come-uppance.\" Lapham shut his lips so that the\nshort, reddish-grey beard stuck straight out on them.\n\n\"What's he done?\"\n\n\"What's he done? Well, now, I'll tell you what he's done, Persis, since\nyou think Rogers is such a saint, and that I used him so badly in\ngetting him out of the business.  He's been dabbling in every sort of\nfool thing you can lay your tongue to,--wild-cat stocks, patent-rights,\nland speculations, oil claims,--till he's run through about everything.\nBut he did have a big milling property out on the line of the P. Y. &\nX.,--saw-mills and grist-mills and lands,--and for the last eight years\nhe's been doing a land-office business with 'em--business that would\nhave made anybody else rich.  But you can't make Milton K. Rogers rich,\nany more than you can fat a hide-bound colt.  It ain't in him.  He'd\nrun through Vanderbilt, Jay Gould, and Tom Scott rolled into one in\nless than six months, give him a chance, and come out and want to\nborrow money of you.  Well, he won't borrow any more money of ME; and\nif he thinks I don't know as much about that milling property as he\ndoes he's mistaken.  I've taken his mills, but I guess I've got the\ninside track; Bill's kept me posted; and now I'm going out there to see\nhow I can unload; and I shan't mind a great deal if Rogers is under the\nload when it's off once.\"\n\n\"I don't understand you, Silas.\"\n\n\"Why, it's just this.  The Great Lacustrine & Polar Railroad has leased\nthe P. Y. & X. for ninety-nine years,--bought it, practically,--and\nit's going to build car-works right by those mills, and it may want\nthem.  And Milton K. Rogers knew it when he turned 'em in on me.\"\n\n\"Well, if the road wants them, don't that make the mills valuable? You\ncan get what you ask for them!\"\n\n\"Can I? The P. Y. & X. is the only road that runs within fifty miles of\nthe mills, and you can't get a foot of lumber nor a pound of flour to\nmarket any other way.  As long as he had a little local road like the\nP. Y. & X. to deal with, Rogers could manage; but when it come to a big\nthrough line like the G. L. & P., he couldn't stand any chance at all.\nIf such a road as that took a fancy to his mills, do you think it would\npay what he asked? No, sir! He would take what the road offered, or\nelse the road would tell him to carry his flour and lumber to market\nhimself.\"\n\n\"And do you suppose he knew the G. L. & P. wanted the mills when he\nturned them in on you?\" asked Mrs. Lapham aghast, and falling\nhelplessly into his alphabetical parlance.\n\nThe Colonel laughed scoffingly.  \"Well, when Milton K. Rogers don't\nknow which side his bread's buttered on! I don't understand,\" he added\nthoughtfully, \"how he's always letting it fall on the buttered side.\nBut such a man as that is sure to have a screw loose in him somewhere.\"\nMrs. Lapham sat discomfited.  All that she could say was, \"Well, I want\nyou should ask yourself whether Rogers would ever have gone wrong, or\ngot into these ways of his, if it hadn't been for your forcing him out\nof the business when you did.  I want you should think whether you're\nnot responsible for everything he's done since.\"\n\n\"You go and get that bag of mine ready,\" said Lapham sullenly.  \"I\nguess I can take care of myself.  And Milton K. Rogers too,\" he added.\n\n\nThat evening Corey spent the time after dinner in his own room, with\nrestless excursions to the library, where his mother sat with his\nfather and sisters, and showed no signs of leaving them.  At last, in\ncoming down, he encountered her on the stairs, going up.  They both\nstopped consciously.\n\n\"I would like to speak with you, mother.  I have been waiting to see\nyou alone.\"\n\n\"Come to my room,\" she said.\n\n\"I have a feeling that you know what I want to say,\" he began there.\n\nShe looked up at him where he stood by the chimney-piece, and tried to\nput a cheerful note into her questioning \"Yes?\"\n\n\"Yes; and I have a feeling that you won't like it--that you won't\napprove of it.  I wish you did--I wish you could!\"\n\n\"I'm used to liking and approving everything you do, Tom.  If I don't\nlike this at once, I shall try to like it--you know that--for your\nsake, whatever it is.\"\n\n\"I'd better be short,\" he said, with a quick sigh.  \"It's about Miss\nLapham.\" He hastened to add, \"I hope it isn't surprising to you.  I'd\nhave told you before, if I could.\"\n\n\"No, it isn't surprising.  I was afraid--I suspected something of the\nkind.\"\n\nThey were both silent in a painful silence.\n\n\"Well, mother?\" he asked at last.\n\n\"If it's something you've quite made up mind to----\"\n\n\"It is!\"\n\n\"And if you've already spoken to her----\"\n\n\"I had to do that first, of course.\"\n\n\"There would be no use of my saying anything, even if I disliked it.\"\n\n\"You do dislike it!\"\n\n\"No--no! I can't say that.  Of course I should have preferred it if you\nhad chosen some nice girl among those that you had been brought up\nwith--some friend or associate of your sisters, whose people we had\nknown----\"\n\n\"Yes, I understand that, and I can assure you that I haven't been\nindifferent to your feelings.  I have tried to consider them from the\nfirst, and it kept me hesitating in a way that I'm ashamed to think of;\nfor it wasn't quite right towards--others. But your feelings and my\nsisters' have been in my mind, and if I couldn't yield to what I\nsupposed they must be, entirely----\"\n\nEven so good a son and brother as this, when it came to his love\naffair, appeared to think that he had yielded much in considering the\nfeelings of his family at all.\n\nHis mother hastened to comfort him.  \"I know--I know.  I've seen for\nsome time that this might happen, Tom, and I have prepared myself for\nit.  I have talked it over with your father, and we both agreed from\nthe beginning that you were not to be hampered by our feeling.\nStill--it is a surprise.  It must be.\"\n\n\"I know it.  I can understand your feeling.  But I'm sure that it's one\nthat will last only while you don't know her well.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm sure of that, Tom.  I'm sure that we shall all be fond of\nher,--for your sake at first, even--and I hope she'll like us.\"\n\n\"I am quite certain of that,\" said Corey, with that confidence which\nexperience does not always confirm in such cases.  \"And your taking it\nas you do lifts a tremendous load off me.\"\n\nBut he sighed so heavily, and looked so troubled, that his mother said,\n\"Well, now, you mustn't think of that any more.  We wish what is for\nyour happiness, my son, and we will gladly reconcile ourselves to\nanything that might have been disagreeable.  I suppose we needn't speak\nof the family.  We must both think alike about them.  They have\ntheir--drawbacks, but they are thoroughly good people, and I satisfied\nmyself the other night that they were not to be dreaded.\" She rose, and\nput her arm round his neck.  \"And I wish you joy, Tom! If she's half as\ngood as you are, you will both be very happy.\" She was going to kiss\nhim, but something in his looks stopped her--an absence, a trouble,\nwhich broke out in his words.\n\n\"I must tell you, mother! There's been a complication--a\nmistake--that's a blight on me yet, and that it sometimes seems as if\nwe couldn't escape from.  I wonder if you can help us! They all thought\nI meant--the other sister.\"\n\n\"O Tom! But how COULD they?\"\n\n\"I don't know.  It seemed so glaringly plain--I was ashamed of making\nit so outright from the beginning.  But they did.  Even she did,\nherself!\"\n\n\"But where could they have thought your eyes were--your taste? It\nwouldn't be surprising if any one were taken with that wonderful\nbeauty; and I'm sure she's good too.  But I'm astonished at them! To\nthink you could prefer that little, black, odd creature, with her\njoking and----\"\n\n\"MOTHER!\" cried the young man, turning a ghastly face of warning upon\nher.\n\n\"What do you mean, Tom?\"\n\n\"Did you--did--did you think so too--that it was IRENE I meant?\"\n\n\"Why, of course!\"\n\nHe stared at her hopelessly.\n\n\"O my son!\" she said, for all comment on the situation.\n\n\"Don't reproach me, mother! I couldn't stand it.\"\n\n\"No. I didn't mean to do that.  But how--HOW could it happen?\"\n\n\"I don't know.  When she first told me that they had understood it so,\nI laughed--almost--it was so far from me.  But now when you seem to\nhave had the same idea--Did you all think so?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThey remained looking at each other.  Then Mrs. Corey began: \"It did\npass through my mind once--that day I went to call upon them--that it\nmight not be as we thought; but I knew so little of--of----\"\n\n\"Penelope,\" Corey mechanically supplied.\n\n\"Is that her name?--I forgot--that I only thought of you in relation to\nher long enough to reject the idea; and it was natural after our seeing\nsomething of the other one last year, that I might suppose you had\nformed some--attachment----\"\n\n\"Yes; that's what they thought too.  But I never thought of her as\nanything but a pretty child.  I was civil to her because you wished it;\nand when I met her here again, I only tried to see her so that I could\ntalk with her about her sister.\"\n\n\"You needn't defend yourself to ME, Tom,\" said his mother, proud to say\nit to him in his trouble.  \"It's a terrible business for them, poor\nthings,\" she added.  \"I don't know how they could get over it.  But, of\ncourse, sensible people must see----\"\n\n\"They haven't got over it.  At least she hasn't. Since it's happened,\nthere's been nothing that hasn't made me prouder and fonder of her! At\nfirst I WAS charmed with her--my fancy was taken; she delighted me--I\ndon't know how; but she was simply the most fascinating person I ever\nsaw.  Now I never think of that.  I only think how good she is--how\npatient she is with me, and how unsparing she is of herself.  If she\nwere concerned alone--if I were not concerned too--it would soon end.\nShe's never had a thought for anything but her sister's feeling and\nmine from the beginning.  I go there,--I know that I oughtn't, but I\ncan't help it,--and she suffers it, and tries not to let me see that\nshe is suffering it.  There never was any one like her--so brave, so\ntrue, so noble.  I won't give her up--I can't. But it breaks my heart\nwhen she accuses herself of what was all MY doing.  We spend our time\ntrying to reason out of it, but we always come back to it at last, and\nI have to hear her morbidly blaming herself.  Oh!\"\n\nDoubtless Mrs. Corey imagined some reliefs to this suffering, some\nqualifications of this sublimity in a girl she had disliked so\ndistinctly; but she saw none in her son's behaviour, and she gave him\nher further sympathy.  She tried to praise Penelope, and said that it\nwas not to be expected that she could reconcile herself at once to\neverything.  \"I shouldn't have liked it in her if she had.  But time\nwill bring it all right.  And if she really cares for you----\"\n\n\"I extorted that from her.\"\n\n\"Well, then, you must look at it in the best light you can.  There is\nno blame anywhere, and the mortification and pain is something that\nmust be lived down.  That's all.  And don't let what I said grieve you,\nTom.  You know I scarcely knew her, and I--I shall be sure to like any\none you like, after all.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" said the young man drearily.  \"Will you tell father?\"\n\n\"If you wish.\"\n\n\"He must know.  And I couldn't stand any more of this, just yet--any\nmore mistake.\"\n\n\"I will tell him,\" said Mrs. Corey; and it was naturally the next thing\nfor a woman who dwelt so much on decencies to propose: \"We must go to\ncall on her--your sisters and I. They have never seen her even; and\nshe mustn't be allowed to think we're indifferent to her, especially\nunder the circumstances.\"\n\n\"Oh no! Don't go--not yet,\" cried Corey, with an instinctive perception\nthat nothing could be worse for him.  \"We must wait--we must be\npatient.  I'm afraid it would be painful to her now.\"\n\nHe turned away without speaking further; and his mother's eyes followed\nhim wistfully to the door.  There were some questions that she would\nhave liked to ask him; but she had to content herself with trying to\nanswer them when her husband put them to her.\n\nThere was this comfort for her always in Bromfield Corey, that he never\nwas much surprised at anything, however shocking or painful.  His\nstandpoint in regard to most matters was that of the sympathetic\nhumorist who would be glad to have the victim of circumstance laugh\nwith him, but was not too much vexed when the victim could not.  He\nlaughed now when his wife, with careful preparation, got the facts of\nhis son's predicament fully under his eye.\n\n\"Really, Bromfield,\" she said, \"I don't see how you can laugh.  Do you\nsee any way out of it?\"\n\n\"It seems to me that the way has been found already.  Tom has told his\nlove to the right one, and the wrong one knows it.  Time will do the\nrest.\"\n\n\"If I had so low an opinion of them all as that, it would make me very\nunhappy.  It's shocking to think of it.\"\n\n\"It is upon the theory of ladies and all young people,\" said her\nhusband, with a shrug, feeling his way to the matches on the mantel,\nand then dropping them with a sign, as if recollecting that he must not\nsmoke there.  \"I've no doubt Tom feels himself an awful sinner.  But\napparently he's resigned to his sin; he isn't going to give her up.\"\n\n\"I'm glad to say, for the sake of human nature, that SHE isn't\nresigned--little as I like her,\" cried Mrs. Corey.\n\nHer husband shrugged again.  \"Oh, there mustn't be any indecent haste.\nShe will instinctively observe the proprieties.  But come, now, Anna!\nyou mustn't pretend to me here, in the sanctuary of home, that\npractically the human affections don't reconcile themselves to any\nsituation that the human sentiments condemn.  Suppose the wrong sister\nhad died: would the right one have had any scruple in marrying Tom,\nafter they had both 'waited a proper time,' as the phrase is?\"\n\n\"Bromfield, you're shocking!\"\n\n\"Not more shocking than reality.  You may regard this as a second\nmarriage.\" He looked at her with twinkling eyes, full of the triumph\nthe spectator of his species feels in signal exhibitions of human\nnature.  \"Depend upon it, the right sister will be reconciled; the\nwrong one will be consoled; and all will go merry as a marriage bell--a\nsecond marriage bell.  Why, it's quite like a romance!\" Here he laughed\noutright again.\n\n\"Well,\" sighed the wife, \"I could almost wish the right one, as you\ncall her, would reject Tom, I dislike her so much.\"\n\n\"Ah, now you're talking business, Anna,\" said her husband, with his\nhands spread behind the back he turned comfortably to the fire.  \"The\nwhole Lapham tribe is distasteful to me.  As I don't happen to have\nseen our daughter-in-law elect, I have still the hope--which you're\ndisposed to forbid me--that she may not be quite so unacceptable as the\nothers.\"\n\n\"Do you really feel so, Bromfield?\" anxiously inquired his wife.\n\n\"Yes--I think I do;\" and he sat down, and stretched out his long legs\ntoward the fire.\n\n\"But it's very inconsistent of you to oppose the matter now, when\nyou've shown so much indifference up to this time.  You've told me, all\nalong, that it was of no use to oppose it.\"\n\n\"So I have.  I was convinced of that at the beginning, or my reason\nwas.  You know very well that I am equal to any trial, any sacrifice,\nday after to-morrow; but when it comes to-day it's another thing.  As\nlong as this crisis decently kept its distance, I could look at it with\nan impartial eye; but now that it seems at hand, I find that, while my\nreason is still acquiescent, my nerves are disposed to--excuse the\nphrase--kick. I ask myself, what have I done nothing for, all my life,\nand lived as a gentleman should, upon the earnings of somebody else, in\nthe possession of every polite taste and feeling that adorns leisure,\nif I'm to come to this at last? And I find no satisfactory answer.  I\nsay to myself that I might as well have yielded to the pressure all\nround me, and gone to work, as Tom has.\"\n\nMrs. Corey looked at him forlornly, divining the core of real\nrepugnance that existed in his self-satire.\n\n\"I assure you, my dear,\" he continued, \"that the recollection of what I\nsuffered from the Laphams at that dinner of yours is an anguish still.\nIt wasn't their behaviour,--they behaved well enough--or ill enough;\nbut their conversation was terrible.  Mrs. Lapham's range was strictly\ndomestic; and when the Colonel got me in the library, he poured mineral\npaint all over me, till I could have been safely warranted not to crack\nor scale in any climate.  I suppose we shall have to see a good deal of\nthem.  They will probably come here every Sunday night to tea.  It's a\nperspective without a vanishing-point.\"\n\n\"It may not be so bad, after all,\" said his wife; and she suggested for\nhis consolation that he knew very little about the Laphams yet.\n\nHe assented to the fact.  \"I know very little about them, and about my\nother fellow-beings. I dare say that I should like the Laphams better\nif I knew them better.  But in any case, I resign myself.  And we must\nkeep in view the fact that this is mainly Tom's affair, and if his\naffections have regulated it to his satisfaction, we must be content.\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" sighed Mrs. Corey.  \"And perhaps it won't turn out so badly.\nIt's a great comfort to know that you feel just as I do about it.\"\n\n\"I do,\" said her husband, \"and more too.\"\n\nIt was she and her daughters who would be chiefly annoyed by the Lapham\nconnection; she knew that.  But she had to begin to bear the burden by\nhelping her husband to bear his light share of it.  To see him so\ndepressed dismayed her, and she might well have reproached him more\nsharply than she did for showing so much indifference, when she was so\nanxious, at first.  But that would not have served any good end now.\nShe even answered him patiently when he asked her, \"What did you say to\nTom when he told you it was the other one?\"\n\n\"What could I say? I could do nothing, but try to take back what I had\nsaid against her.\"\n\n\"Yes, you had quite enough to do, I suppose.  It's an awkward business.\nIf it had been the pretty one, her beauty would have been our excuse.\nBut the plain one--what do you suppose attracted him in her?\"\n\nMrs. Corey sighed at the futility of the question.  \"Perhaps I did her\ninjustice.  I only saw her a few moments.  Perhaps I got a false\nimpression.  I don't think she's lacking in sense, and that's a great\nthing.  She'll be quick to see that we don't mean unkindness, and\ncan't, by anything we say or do, when she's Tom's wife.\" She pronounced\nthe distasteful word with courage, and went on: \"The pretty one might\nnot have been able to see that.  She might have got it into her head\nthat we were looking down on her; and those insipid people are terribly\nstubborn.  We can come to some understanding with this one; I'm sure of\nthat.\" She ended by declaring that it was now their duty to help Tom\nout of his terrible predicament.\n\n\"Oh, even the Lapham cloud has a silver lining,\" said Corey.  \"In fact,\nit seems really to have all turned out for the best, Anna; though it's\nrather curious to find you the champion of the Lapham side, at last.\nConfess, now, that the right girl has secretly been your choice all\nalong, and that while you sympathise with the wrong one, you rejoice in\nthe tenacity with which the right one is clinging to her own!\" He added\nwith final seriousness, \"It's just that she should, and, so far as I\nunderstand the case, I respect her for it.\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" sighed Mrs. Corey.  \"It's natural, and it's right.\" But she\nadded, \"I suppose they're glad of him on any terms.\"\n\n\"That is what I have been taught to believe,\" said her husband.  \"When\nshall we see our daughter-in-law elect? I find myself rather impatient\nto have that part of it over.\"\n\nMrs. Corey hesitated.  \"Tom thinks we had better not call, just yet.\"\n\n\"She has told him of your terrible behaviour when you called before?\"\n\n\"No, Bromfield! She couldn't be so vulgar as that?\"\n\n\"But anything short of it?\"\n\n\n\nXXI.\n\n\nLAPHAM was gone a fortnight.  He was in a sullen humour when he came\nback, and kept himself shut close within his own den at the office the\nfirst day.  He entered it in the morning without a word to his clerks\nas he passed through the outer room, and he made no sign throughout the\nforenoon, except to strike savagely on his desk-bell from time to time,\nand send out to Walker for some book of accounts or a letter-file. His\nboy confidentially reported to Walker that the old man seemed to have\ngot a lot of papers round; and at lunch the book-keeper said to Corey,\nat the little table which they had taken in a corner together, in\ndefault of seats at the counter, \"Well, sir, I guess there's a cold\nwave coming.\"\n\nCorey looked up innocently, and said, \"I haven't read the weather\nreport.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Walker continued, \"it's coming.  Areas of rain along the\nwhole coast, and increased pressure in the region of the private\noffice.  Storm-signals up at the old man's door now.\"\n\nCorey perceived that he was speaking figuratively, and that his\nmeteorology was entirely personal to Lapham.  \"What do you mean?\" he\nasked, without vivid interest in the allegory, his mind being full of\nhis own tragi-comedy.\n\n\"Why, just this: I guess the old man's takin' in sail.  And I guess\nhe's got to.  As I told you the first time we talked about him, there\ndon't any one know one-quarter as much about the old man's business as\nthe old man does himself; and I ain't betraying any confidence when I\nsay that I guess that old partner of his has got pretty deep into his\nbooks.  I guess he's over head and ears in 'em, and the old man's gone\nin after him, and he's got a drownin' man's grip round his neck.  There\nseems to be a kind of a lull--kind of a dead calm, I call it--in the\npaint market just now; and then again a ten-hundred-thousand-dollar man\ndon't build a hundred-thousand-dollar house without feeling the drain,\nunless there's a regular boom.  And just now there ain't any boom at\nall.  Oh, I don't say but what the old man's got anchors to windward;\nguess he HAS; but if he's GOIN' to leave me his money, I wish he'd left\nit six weeks ago.  Yes, sir, I guess there's a cold wave comin'; but\nyou can't generally 'most always tell, as a usual thing, where the old\nman's concerned, and it's ONLY a guess.\" Walker began to feed in his\nbreaded chop with the same nervous excitement with which he abandoned\nhimself to the slangy and figurative excesses of his talks.  Corey had\nlistened with a miserable curiosity and compassion up to a certain\nmoment, when a broad light of hope flashed upon him.  It came from\nLapham's potential ruin; and the way out of the labyrinth that had\nhitherto seemed so hopeless was clear enough, if another's disaster\nwould befriend him, and give him the opportunity to prove the\nunselfishness of his constancy.  He thought of the sum of money that\nwas his own, and that he might offer to lend, or practically give, if\nthe time came; and with his crude hopes and purposes formlessly\nexulting in his heart, he kept on listening with an unchanged\ncountenance.\n\nWalker could not rest till he had developed the whole situation, so far\nas he knew it.  \"Look at the stock we've got on hand.  There's going to\nbe an awful shrinkage on that, now! And when everybody is shutting\ndown, or running half-time, the works up at Lapham are going full chip,\njust the same as ever.  Well, it's his pride.  I don't say but what\nit's a good sort of pride, but he likes to make his brags that the\nfire's never been out in the works since they started, and that no\nman's work or wages has ever been cut down yet at Lapham, it don't\nmatter WHAT the times are.  Of course,\" explained Walker, \"I shouldn't\ntalk so to everybody; don't know as I should talk so to anybody but\nyou, Mr. Corey.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" assented Corey.\n\n\"Little off your feed to-day,\" said Walker, glancing at Corey's plate.\n\n\"I got up with a headache.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, if you're like me you'll carry it round all day, then.  I\ndon't know a much meaner thing than a headache--unless it's earache, or\ntoothache, or some other kind of ache I'm pretty hard to suit, when it\ncomes to diseases.  Notice how yellow the old man looked when he came\nin this morning? I don't like to see a man of his build look\nyellow--much.\" About the middle of the afternoon the dust-coloured face\nof Rogers, now familiar to Lapham's clerks, showed itself among them.\n\"Has Colonel Lapham returned yet?\" he asked, in his dry, wooden tones,\nof Lapham's boy.\n\n\"Yes, he's in his office,\" said the boy; and as Rogers advanced, he\nrose and added, \"I don't know as you can see him to-day. His orders are\nnot to let anybody in.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed!\" said Rogers; \"I think he will see ME!\" and he pressed\nforward.\n\n\"Well, I'll have to ask,\" returned the boy; and hastily preceding\nRogers, he put his head in at Lapham's door, and then withdrew it.\n\"Please to sit down,\" he said; \"he'll see you pretty soon;\" and, with\nan air of some surprise, Rogers obeyed.  His sere, dull-brown whiskers\nand the moustache closing over both lips were incongruously and\nillogically clerical in effect, and the effect was heightened for no\nreason by the parchment texture of his skin; the baldness extending to\nthe crown of his head was like a baldness made up for the stage.  What\nhis face expressed chiefly was a bland and beneficent caution.  Here,\nyou must have said to yourself, is a man of just, sober, and prudent\nviews, fixed purposes, and the good citizenship that avoids debt and\nhazard of every kind.\n\n\"What do you want?\" asked Lapham, wheeling round in his swivel-chair as\nRogers entered his room, and pushing the door shut with his foot,\nwithout rising.\n\nRogers took the chair that was not offered him, and sat with his\nhat-brim on his knees, and its crown pointed towards Lapham.  \"I want\nto know what you are going to do,\" he answered with sufficient\nself-possession.\n\n\"I'll tell you, first, what I've done,\" said Lapham.  \"I've been to\nDubuque, and I've found out all about that milling property you turned\nin on me.  Did you know that the G. L. & P. had leased the P. Y. & X.?\"\n\n\"I some suspected that it might.\"\n\n\"Did you know it when you turned the property in on me?  Did you know\nthat the G. L. & P. wanted to buy the mills?\"\n\n\"I presumed the road would give a fair price for them,\" said Rogers,\nwinking his eyes in outward expression of inwardly blinking the point.\n\n\"You lie,\" said Lapham, as quietly as if correcting him in a slight\nerror; and Rogers took the word with equal sang froid.  \"You knew the\nroad wouldn't give a fair price for the mills.  You knew it would give\nwhat it chose, and that I couldn't help myself, when you let me take\nthem.  You're a thief, Milton K. Rogers, and you stole money I lent\nyou.\" Rogers sat listening, as if respectfully considering the\nstatements.  \"You knew how I felt about that old matter--or my wife\ndid; and that I wanted to make it up to you, if you felt anyway badly\nused.  And you took advantage of it.  You've got money out of me, in\nthe first place, on securities that wa'n't worth thirty-five cents on\nthe dollar, and you've let me in for this thing, and that thing, and\nyou've bled me every time.  And all I've got to show for it is a\nmilling property on a line of road that can squeeze me, whenever it\nwants to, as dry as it pleases.  And you want to know what I'm going to\ndo? I'm going to squeeze YOU.  I'm going to sell these collaterals of\nyours,\"--he touched a bundle of papers among others that littered his\ndesk,--\"and I'm going to let the mills go for what they'll fetch.  I\nain't going to fight the G. L. & P.\"\n\nLapham wheeled about in his chair and turned his burly back on his\nvisitor, who sat wholly unmoved.\n\n\"There are some parties,\" he began, with a dry tranquillity ignoring\nLapham's words, as if they had been an outburst against some third\nperson, who probably merited them, but in whom he was so little\ninterested that he had been obliged to use patience in listening to his\ncondemnation,--\"there are some English parties who have been making\ninquiries in regard to those mills.\"\n\n\"I guess you're lying, Rogers,\" said Lapham, without looking round.\n\n\"Well, all that I have to ask is that you will not act hastily.\"\n\n\"I see you don't think I'm in earnest!\" cried Lapham, facing fiercely\nabout.  \"You think I'm fooling, do you?\" He struck his bell, and\n\"William,\" he ordered the boy who answered it, and who stood waiting\nwhile he dashed off a note to the brokers and enclosed it with the\nbundle of securities in a large envelope, \"take these down to Gallop &\nPaddock's, in State Street, right away.  Now go!\" he said to Rogers,\nwhen the boy had closed the door after him; and he turned once more to\nhis desk.\n\nRogers rose from his chair, and stood with his hat in his hand.  He was\nnot merely dispassionate in his attitude and expression, he was\nimpartial.  He wore the air of a man who was ready to return to\nbusiness whenever the wayward mood of his interlocutor permitted.\n\"Then I understand,\" he said, \"that you will take no action in regard\nto the mills till I have seen the parties I speak of.\"\n\nLapham faced about once more, and sat looking up into the visage of\nRogers in silence.  \"I wonder what you're up to,\" he said at last; \"I\nshould like to know.\" But as Rogers made no sign of gratifying his\ncuriosity, and treated this last remark of Lapham's as of the\nirrelevance of all the rest, he said, frowning, \"You bring me a party\nthat will give me enough for those mills to clear me of you, and I'll\ntalk to you.  But don't you come here with any man of straw.  And I'll\ngive you just twenty-four hours to prove yourself a swindler again.\"\n\nOnce more Lapham turned his back, and Rogers, after looking\nthoughtfully into his hat a moment, cleared his throat, and quietly\nwithdrew, maintaining to the last his unprejudiced demeanour.\n\nLapham was not again heard from, as Walker phrased it, during the\nafternoon, except when the last mail was taken in to him; then the\nsound of rending envelopes, mixed with that of what seemed suppressed\nswearing, penetrated to the outer office.  Somewhat earlier than the\nusual hour for closing, he appeared there with his hat on and his\novercoat buttoned about him.  He said briefly to his boy, \"William, I\nshan't be back again this afternoon,\" and then went to Miss Dewey and\nleft a number of letters on her table to be copied, and went out.\nNothing had been said, but a sense of trouble subtly diffused itself\nthrough those who saw him go out.\n\nThat evening as he sat down with his wife alone at tea, he asked,\n\"Ain't Pen coming to supper?\"\n\n\"No, she ain't,\" said his wife.  \"I don't know as I like the way she's\ngoing on, any too well.  I'm afraid, if she keeps on, she'll be down\nsick.  She's got deeper feelings than Irene.\"\n\nLapham said nothing, but having helped himself to the abundance of his\ntable in his usual fashion, he sat and looked at his plate with an\nindifference that did not escape the notice of his wife.  \"What's the\nmatter with YOU?\" she asked.\n\n\"Nothing. I haven't got any appetite.\"\n\n\"What's the matter?\" she persisted.\n\n\"Trouble's the matter; bad luck and lots of it's the matter,\" said\nLapham.  \"I haven't ever hid anything from you, Persis, well you asked\nme, and it's too late to begin now.  I'm in a fix.  I'll tell you what\nkind of a fix, if you think it'll do you any good; but I guess you'll\nbe satisfied to know that it's a fix.\"\n\n\"How much of a one?\" she asked with a look of grave, steady courage in\nher eyes.\n\n\"Well, I don't know as I can tell, just yet,\" said Lapham, avoiding\nthis look.  \"Things have been dull all the fall, but I thought they'd\nbrisk up come winter.  They haven't.  There have been a lot of\nfailures, and some of 'em owed me, and some of 'em had me on their\npaper; and----\" Lapham stopped.\n\n\"And what?\" prompted his wife.\n\nHe hesitated before he added, \"And then--Rogers.\"\n\n\"I'm to blame for that,\" said Mrs. Lapham.  \"I forced you to it.\"\n\n\"No; I was as willing to go into it as what you were,\" answered Lapham.\n\"I don't want to blame anybody.\"\n\nMrs. Lapham had a woman's passion for fixing responsibility; she could\nnot help saying, as soon as acquitted, \"I warned you against him,\nSilas.  I told you not to let him get in any deeper with you.\"\n\n\"Oh yes.  I had to help him to try to get my money back.  I might as\nwell poured water into a sieve.  And now--\" Lapham stopped.\n\n\"Don't be afraid to speak out to me, Silas Lapham.  If it comes to the\nworst, I want to know it--I've got to know it.  What did I ever care\nfor the money? I've had a happy home with you ever since we were\nmarried, and I guess I shall have as long as you live, whether we go on\nto the Back Bay, or go back to the old house at Lapham.  I know who's\nto blame, and I blame myself.  It was my forcing Rogers on to you.\" She\ncame back to this with her helpless longing, inbred in all Puritan\nsouls, to have some one specifically suffer for the evil in the world,\neven if it must be herself.\n\n\"It hasn't come to the worst yet, Persis,\" said her husband.  \"But I\nshall have to hold up on the new house a little while, till I can see\nwhere I am.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't care if we had to sell it,\" cried his wife, in passionate\nself-condemnation. \"I should be GLAD if we had to, as far as I'm\nconcerned.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't,\" said Lapham.\n\n\"I know!\" said his wife; and she remembered ruefully how his heart was\nset on it.\n\nHe sat musing.  \"Well, I guess it's going to come out all right in the\nend.  Or, if it ain't,\" he sighed, \"we can't help it.  May be Pen\nneedn't worry so much about Corey, after all,\" he continued, with a\nbitter irony new to him.  \"It's an ill wind that blows nobody good.\nAnd there's a chance,\" he ended, with a still bitterer laugh, \"that\nRogers will come to time, after all.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it!\" exclaimed Mrs. Lapham, with a gleam of hope in\nher eyes.  \"What chance?\"\n\n\"One in ten million,\" said Lapham; and her face fell again.  \"He says\nthere are some English parties after him to buy these mills.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well, I gave him twenty-four hours to prove himself a liar.\"\n\n\"You don't believe there are any such parties?\"\n\n\"Not in THIS world.\"\n\n\"But if there were?\"\n\n\"Well, if there were, Persis----But pshaw!\"\n\n\"No, no!\" she pleaded eagerly.  \"It don't seem as if he COULD be such a\nvillain.  What would be the use of his pretending? If he brought the\nparties to you.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Lapham scornfully, \"I'd let them have the mills at the\nprice Rogers turned 'em in on me at.  I don't want to make anything on\n'em. But guess I shall hear from the G. L. & P. first.  And when they\nmake their offer, I guess I'll have to accept it, whatever it is.  I\ndon't think they'll have a great many competitors.\"\n\nMrs. Lapham could not give up her hope.  \"If you could get your price\nfrom those English parties before they knew that the G. L. & P. wanted\nto buy the mills, would it let you out with Rogers?\"\n\n\"Just about,\" said Lapham.\n\n\"Then I know he'll move heaven and earth to bring it about.  I KNOW you\nwon't be allowed to suffer for doing him a kindness, Silas.  He CAN'T\nbe so ungrateful! Why, why SHOULD he pretend to have any such parties\nin view when he hasn't? Don't you be down-hearted, Si.  You'll see that\nhe'll be round with them to-morrow.\"\n\nLapham laughed, but she urged so many reasons for her belief in Rogers\nthat Lapham began to rekindle his own faith a little.  He ended by\nasking for a hot cup of tea; and Mrs. Lapham sent the pot out and had a\nfresh one steeped for him.  After that he made a hearty supper in the\nrevulsion from his entire despair; and they fell asleep that night\ntalking hopefully of his affairs, which he laid before her fully, as he\nused to do when he first started in business.  That brought the old\ntimes back, and he said: \"If this had happened then, I shouldn't have\ncared much.  I was young then, and I wasn't afraid of anything.  But I\nnoticed that after I passed fifty I began to get scared easier.  I\ndon't believe I could pick up, now, from a regular knock-down.\"\n\n\"Pshaw! YOU scared, Silas Lapham?\" cried his wife proudly.  \"I should\nlike to see the thing that ever scared you; or the knockdown that YOU\ncouldn't pick up from!\"\n\n\"Is that so, Persis?\" he asked, with the joy her courage gave him.\n\nIn the middle of the night she called to him, in a voice which the\ndarkness rendered still more deeply troubled: \"Are you awake, Silas?\"\n\n\"Yes; I'm awake.\"\n\n\"I've been thinking about those English parties, Si----\"\n\n\"So've I.\"\n\n\"And I can't make it out but what you'd be just as bad as Rogers, every\nbit and grain, if you were to let them have the mills----\"\n\n\"And not tell 'em what the chances were with the G. L. & P.? I thought\nof that, and you needn't be afraid.\"\n\nShe began to bewail herself, and to sob convulsively: \"O Silas! O\nSilas!\" Heaven knows in what measure the passion of her soul was mired\nwith pride in her husband's honesty, relief from an apprehended\nstruggle, and pity for him.\n\n\"Hush, hush, Persis!\" he besought her.  \"You'll wake Pen if you keep on\nthat way.  Don't cry any more! You mustn't.\"\n\n\"Oh, let me cry, Silas! It'll help me.  I shall be all right in a\nminute.  Don't you mind.\" She sobbed herself quiet.  \"It does seem too\nhard,\" she said, when she could speak again, \"that you have to give up\nthis chance when Providence had fairly raised it up for you.\"\n\n\"I guess it wa'n't Providence raised it up,\" said Lapham.  \"Any rate,\nit's got to go.  Most likely Rogers was lyin', and there ain't any such\nparties; but if there were, they couldn't have the mills from me\nwithout the whole story.  Don't you be troubled, Persis.  I'm going to\npull through all right.\" \"Oh, I ain't afraid.  I don't suppose but what\nthere's plenty would help you, if they knew you needed it, Si.\"\n\n\"They would if they knew I DIDN'T need it,\" said Lapham sardonically.\n\n\"Did you tell Bill how you stood?\"\n\n\"No, I couldn't bear to.  I've been the rich one so long, that I\ncouldn't bring myself to own up that I was in danger.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Besides, it didn't look so ugly till to-day. But I guess we shan't let\nugly looks scare us.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\n\nXXII.\n\n\nTHE morning postman brought Mrs. Lapham a letter from Irene, which was\nchiefly significant because it made no reference whatever to the writer\nor her state of mind.  It gave the news of her uncle's family; it told\nof their kindness to her; her cousin Will was going to take her and his\nsisters ice-boating on the river, when it froze.\n\nBy the time this letter came, Lapham had gone to his business, and the\nmother carried it to Penelope to talk over.  \"What do you make out of\nit?\" she asked; and without waiting to be answered she said, \"I don't\nknow as I believe in cousins marrying, a great deal; but if Irene and\nWill were to fix it up between 'em----\" She looked vaguely at Penelope.\n\n\"It wouldn't make any difference as far as I was concerned,\" replied\nthe girl listlessly.\n\nMrs. Lapham lost her patience.\n\n\"Well, then, I'll tell you what, Penelope!\" she exclaimed.  \"Perhaps\nit'll make a difference to you if you know that your father's in REAL\ntrouble.  He's harassed to death, and he was awake half the night,\ntalking about it.  That abominable Rogers has got a lot of money away\nfrom him; and he's lost by others that he's helped,\"--Mrs. Lapham put\nit in this way because she had no time to be explicit,--\"and I want you\nshould come out of your room now, and try to be of some help and\ncomfort to him when he comes home to-night.  I guess Irene wouldn't\nmope round much, if she was here,\" she could not help adding.\n\nThe girl lifted herself on her elbow.  \"What's that you say about\nfather?\" she demanded eagerly.  \"Is he in trouble? Is he going to lose\nhis money? Shall we have to stay in this house?\"\n\n\"We may be very GLAD to stay in this house,\" said Mrs. Lapham, half\nangry with herself for having given cause for the girl's conjectures,\nand half with the habit of prosperity in her child, which could\nconceive no better of what adversity was.  \"And I want you should get\nup and show that you've got some feeling for somebody in the world\nbesides yourself.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'll get UP!\" said the girl promptly, almost cheerfully.\n\n\"I don't say it's as bad now as it looked a little while ago,\" said her\nmother, conscientiously hedging a little from the statement which she\nhad based rather upon her feelings than her facts.  \"Your father thinks\nhe'll pull through all right, and I don't know but what he will.  But I\nwant you should see if you can't do something to cheer him up and keep\nhim from getting so perfectly down-hearted as he seems to get, under\nthe load he's got to carry.  And stop thinking about yourself a while,\nand behave yourself like a sensible girl.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said the girl; \"I will.  You needn't be troubled about me\nany more.\"\n\nBefore she left her room she wrote a note, and when she came down she\nwas dressed to go out-of-doors and post it herself.  The note was to\nCorey:--\n\n\"Do not come to see me any more till you hear from me.  I have a reason\nwhich I cannot give you now; and you must not ask what it is.\"\n\nAll day she went about in a buoyant desperation, and she came down to\nmeet her father at supper.\n\n\"Well, Persis,\" he said scornfully, as he sat down, \"we might as well\nsaved our good resolutions till they were wanted.  I guess those\nEnglish parties have gone back on Rogers.\"\n\n\"Do you mean he didn't come?\"\n\n\"He hadn't come up to half-past five,\" said Lapham.\n\n\"Tchk!\" uttered his wife.  \"But I guess I shall pull through without\nMr. Rogers,\" continued Lapham.  \"A firm that I didn't think COULD\nweather it is still afloat, and so far forth as the danger goes of\nbeing dragged under with it, I'm all right.\" Penelope came in.  \"Hello,\nPen!\" cried her father.  \"It ain't often I meet YOU nowadays.\" He put\nup his hand as she passed his chair, and pulled her down and kissed her.\n\n\"No,\" she said; \"but I thought I'd come down to-night and cheer you up\na little.  I shall not talk; the sight of me will be enough.\"\n\nHer father laughed out.  \"Mother been telling you? Well, I WAS pretty\nblue last night; but I guess I was more scared than hurt.  How'd you\nlike to go to the theatre to-night?  Sellers at the Park.  Heigh?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know.  Don't you think they could get along without me\nthere?\"\n\n\"No; couldn't work it at all,\" cried the Colonel.  \"Let's all go.\nUnless,\" he added inquiringly, \"there's somebody coming here?\"\n\n\"There's nobody coming,\" said Penelope.\n\n\"Good! Then we'll go.  Mother, don't you be late now.\"\n\n\"Oh, I shan't keep you waiting,\" said Mrs. Lapham.  She had thought of\ntelling what a cheerful letter she had got from Irene; but upon the\nwhole it seemed better not to speak of Irene at all just then.  After\nthey returned from the theatre, where the Colonel roared through the\ncomedy, with continual reference of his pleasure to Penelope, to make\nsure that she was enjoying it too, his wife said, as if the whole\naffair had been for the girl's distraction rather than his, \"I don't\nbelieve but what it's going to come out all right about the children;\"\nand then she told him of the letter, and the hopes she had founded upon\nit.\n\n\"Well, perhaps you're right, Persis,\" he consented.\n\n\"I haven't seen Pen so much like herself since it happened.  I declare,\nwhen I see the way she came out to-night, just to please you, I don't\nknow as I want you should get over all your troubles right away.\"\n\n\"I guess there'll be enough to keep Pen going for a while yet,\" said\nthe Colonel, winding up his watch.\n\nBut for a time there was a relief, which Walker noted, in the\natmosphere at the office, and then came another cold wave, slighter\nthan the first, but distinctly felt there, and succeeded by another\nrelief.  It was like the winter which was wearing on to the end of the\nyear, with alternations of freezing weather, and mild days stretching\nto weeks, in which the snow and ice wholly disappeared.  It was none\nthe less winter, and none the less harassing for these fluctuations,\nand Lapham showed in his face and temper the effect of like\nfluctuations in his affairs.  He grew thin and old, and both at home\nand at his office he was irascible to the point of offence.  In these\ndays Penelope shared with her mother the burden of their troubled home,\nand united with her in supporting the silence or the petulance of the\ngloomy, secret man who replaced the presence of jolly prosperity there.\nLapham had now ceased to talk of his troubles, and savagely resented\nhis wife's interference.  \"You mind your own business, Persis,\" he said\none day, \"if you've got any;\" and after that she left him mainly to\nPenelope, who did not think of asking him questions.\n\n\"It's pretty hard on you, Pen,\" she said.\n\n\"That makes it easier for me,\" returned the girl, who did not otherwise\nrefer to her own trouble.\n\nIn her heart she had wondered a little at the absolute obedience of\nCorey, who had made no sign since receiving her note.  She would have\nliked to ask her father if Corey was sick; she would have liked him to\nask her why Corey did not come any more.  Her mother went on--\n\n\"I don't believe your father knows WHERE he stands.  He works away at\nthose papers he brings home here at night, as if he didn't half know\nwhat he was about.  He always did have that close streak in him, and I\ndon't suppose but what he's been going into things he don't want\nanybody else to know about, and he's kept these accounts of his own.\"\n\nSometimes he gave Penelope figures to work at, which he would not\nsubmit to his wife's nimbler arithmetic.  Then she went to bed and left\nthem sitting up till midnight, struggling with problems in which they\nwere both weak.  But she could see that the girl was a comfort to her\nfather, and that his troubles were a defence and shelter to her.  Some\nnights she could hear them going out together, and then she lay awake\nfor their return from their long walk.  When the hour or day of respite\ncame again, the home felt it first.  Lapham wanted to know what the\nnews from Irene was; he joined his wife in all her cheerful\nspeculations, and tried to make her amends for his sullen reticence and\nirritability.  Irene was staying on at Dubuque.  There came a letter\nfrom her, saying that her uncle's people wanted her to spend the winter\nthere.  \"Well, let her,\" said Lapham.  \"It'll be the best thing for\nher.\"\n\nLapham himself had letters from his brother at frequent intervals.  His\nbrother was watching the G. L. & P., which as yet had made no offer for\nthe mills.  Once, when one of these letters came, he submitted to his\nwife whether, in the absence of any positive information that the road\nwanted the property, he might not, with a good conscience, dispose of\nit to the best advantage to anybody who came along.\n\nShe looked wistfully at him; it was on the rise from a season of deep\ndepression with him.  \"No, Si,\" she said; \"I don't see how you could do\nthat.\"\n\nHe did not assent and submit, as he had done at first, but began to\nrail at the unpracticality of women; and then he shut some papers he\nhad been looking over into his desk, and flung out of the room.\n\nOne of the papers had slipped through the crevice of the lid, and lay\nupon the floor.  Mrs. Lapham kept on at her sewing, but after a while\nshe picked the paper up to lay it on the desk.  Then she glanced at it,\nand saw that it was a long column of dates and figures, recording\nsuccessive sums, never large ones, paid regularly to \"Wm. M.\" The dates\ncovered a year, and the sum amounted at least to several hundreds.\n\nMrs. Lapham laid the paper down on the desk, and then she took it up\nagain and put it into her work-basket, meaning to give it to him.  When\nhe came in she saw him looking absent-mindedly about for something, and\nthen going to work upon his papers, apparently without it.  She thought\nshe would wait till he missed it definitely, and then give him the\nscrap she had picked up.  It lay in her basket, and after some days it\nfound its way under the work in it, and she forgot it.\n\n\n\nXXIII.\n\n\nSINCE New Year's there had scarcely been a mild day, and the streets\nwere full of snow, growing foul under the city feet and hoofs, and\nrenewing its purity from the skies with repeated falls, which in turn\nlost their whiteness, beaten down, and beaten black and hard into a\nsolid bed like iron.  The sleighing was incomparable, and the air was\nfull of the din of bells; but Lapham's turnout was not of those that\nthronged the Brighton road every afternoon; the man at the\nlivery-stable sent him word that the mare's legs were swelling.\n\nHe and Corey had little to do with each other.  He did not know how\nPenelope had arranged it with Corey; his wife said she knew no more\nthan he did, and he did not like to ask the girl herself, especially as\nCorey no longer came to the house.  He saw that she was cheerfuller\nthan she had been, and helpfuller with him and her mother.  Now and\nthen Lapham opened his troubled soul to her a little, letting his\nthought break into speech without preamble or conclusion.  Once he\nsaid--\n\n\"Pen, I presume you know I'm in trouble.\"\n\n\"We all seem to be there,\" said the girl.\n\n\"Yes, but there's a difference between being there by your own fault\nand being there by somebody else's.\"\n\n\"I don't call it his fault,\" she said.\n\n\"I call it mine,\" said the Colonel.\n\nThe girl laughed.  Her thought was of her own care, and her father's\nwholly of his.  She must come to his ground.  \"What have you been doing\nwrong?\"\n\n\"I don't know as you'd call it wrong.  It's what people do all the\ntime.  But I wish I'd let stocks alone.  It's what I always promised\nyour mother I would do.  But there's no use cryin' over spilt milk; or\nwatered stock, either.\"\n\n\"I don't think there's much use crying about anything.  If it could\nhave been cried straight, it would have been all right from the start,\"\nsaid the girl, going back to her own affair; and if Lapham had not been\nso deeply engrossed in his, he might have seen how little she cared for\nall that money could do or undo.  He did not observe her enough to see\nhow variable her moods were in those days, and how often she sank from\nsome wild gaiety into abject melancholy; how at times she was fiercely\ndefiant of nothing at all, and at others inexplicably humble and\npatient.  But no doubt none of these signs had passed unnoticed by his\nwife, to whom Lapham said one day, when he came home, \"Persis, what's\nthe reason Pen don't marry Corey?\"\n\n\"You know as well as I do, Silas,\" said Mrs. Lapham, with an inquiring\nlook at him for what lay behind his words.\n\n\"Well, I think it's all tomfoolery, the way she's going on.  There\nain't any rhyme nor reason to it.\" He stopped, and his wife waited.\n\"If she said the word, I could have some help from them.\" He hung his\nhead, and would not meet his wife's eye.\n\n\"I guess you're in a pretty bad way, Si,\" she said pityingly, \"or you\nwouldn't have come to that.\"\n\n\"I'm in a hole,\" said Lapham, \"and I don't know where to turn.  You\nwon't let me do anything about those mills----\"\n\n\"Yes, I'll let you,\" said his wife sadly.\n\nHe gave a miserable cry.  \"You know I can't do anything, if you do.  O\nmy Lord!\"\n\nShe had not seen him so low as that before.  She did not know what to\nsay.  She was frightened, and could only ask, \"Has it come to the\nworst?\"\n\n\"The new house has got to go,\" he answered evasively.\n\nShe did not say anything.  She knew that the work on the house had been\nstopped since the beginning of the year.  Lapham had told the architect\nthat he preferred to leave it unfinished till the spring, as there was\nno prospect of their being able to get into it that winter; and the\narchitect had agreed with him that it would not hurt it to stand.  Her\nheart was heavy for him, though she could not say so.  They sat\ntogether at the table, where she had come to be with him at his belated\nmeal.  She saw that he did not eat, and she waited for him to speak\nagain, without urging him to take anything.  They were past that.\n\n\"And I've sent orders to shut down at the Works,\" he added.\n\n\"Shut down at the Works!\" she echoed with dismay.  She could not take\nit in.  The fire at the Works had never been out before since it was\nfirst kindled.  She knew how he had prided himself upon that; how he\nhad bragged of it to every listener, and had always lugged the fact in\nas the last expression of his sense of success.  \"O Silas!\"\n\n\"What's the use?\" he retorted.  \"I saw it was coming a month ago.\nThere are some fellows out in West Virginia that have been running the\npaint as hard as they could.  They couldn't do much; they used to put\nit on the market raw.  But lately they got to baking it, and now\nthey've struck a vein of natural gas right by their works, and they pay\nten cents for fuel, where I pay a dollar, and they make as good a\npaint.  Anybody can see where it's going to end.  Besides, the market's\nover-stocked.  It's glutted.  There wa'n't anything to do but to shut\nDOWN, and I've SHUT down.\"\n\n\"I don't know what's going to become of the hands in the middle of the\nwinter, this way,\" said Mrs. Lapham, laying hold of one definite\nthought which she could grasp in the turmoil of ruin that whirled\nbefore her eyes.\n\n\"I don't care what becomes of the hands,\" cried Lapham.  \"They've\nshared my luck; now let 'em share the other thing.  And if you're so\nvery sorry for the hands, I wish you'd keep a little of your pity for\nME.  Don't you know what shutting down the Works means?\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed I do, Silas,\" said his wife tenderly.\n\n\"Well, then!\" He rose, leaving his supper untasted, and went into the\nsitting-room, where she presently found him, with that everlasting\nconfusion of papers before him on the desk.  That made her think of the\npaper in her work-basket, and she decided not to make the careworn,\ndistracted man ask her for it, after all.  She brought it to him.\n\nHe glanced blankly at it and then caught it from her, turning red and\nlooking foolish.  \"Where'd you get that?\"\n\n\"You dropped it on the floor the other night, and I picked it up.  Who\nis 'Wm. M.'?\"\n\n\"'Wm. M.'!\" he repeated, looking confusedly at her, and then at the\npaper.  \"Oh,--it's nothing.\" He tore the paper into small pieces, and\nwent and dropped them into the fire.  When Mrs. Lapham came into the\nroom in the morning, before he was down, she found a scrap of the\npaper, which must have fluttered to the hearth; and glancing at it she\nsaw that the words were \"Mrs. M.\" She wondered what dealings with a\nwoman her husband could have, and she remembered the confusion he had\nshown about the paper, and which she had thought was because she had\nsurprised one of his business secrets.  She was still thinking of it\nwhen he came down to breakfast, heavy-eyed, tremulous, with deep seams\nand wrinkles in his face.\n\nAfter a silence which he did not seem inclined to break, \"Silas,\" she\nasked, \"who is 'Mrs. M.'?\"\n\nHe stared at her.  \"I don't know what you're talking about.\"\n\n\"Don't you?\" she returned mockingly.  \"When you do, you tell me.  Do\nyou want any more coffee?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Well, then, you can ring for Alice when you've finished.  I've got\nsome things to attend to.\" She rose abruptly, and left the room.\nLapham looked after her in a dull way, and then went on with his\nbreakfast.  While he still sat at his coffee, she flung into the room\nagain, and dashed some papers down beside his plate.  \"Here are some\nmore things of yours, and I'll thank you to lock them up in your desk\nand not litter my room with them, if you please.\" Now he saw that she\nwas angry, and it must be with him.  It enraged him that in such a time\nof trouble she should fly out at him in that way.  He left the house\nwithout trying to speak to her.  That day Corey came just before\nclosing, and, knocking at Lapham's door, asked if he could speak with\nhim a few moments.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Lapham, wheeling round in his swivel-chair and kicking\nanother towards Corey.  \"Sit down.  I want to talk to you.  I'd ought\nto tell you you're wasting your time here.  I spoke the other day about\nyour placin' yourself better, and I can help you to do it, yet.  There\nain't going to be the out-come for the paint in the foreign markets\nthat we expected, and I guess you better give it up.\"\n\n\"I don't wish to give it up,\" said the young fellow, setting his lips.\n\"I've as much faith in it as ever; and I want to propose now what I\nhinted at in the first place.  I want to put some money into the\nbusiness.\"\n\n\"Some money!\" Lapham leaned towards him, and frowned as if he had not\nquite understood, while he clutched the arms of his chair.\n\n\"I've got about thirty thousand dollars that I could put in, and if you\ndon't want to consider me a partner--I remember that you objected to a\npartner--you can let me regard it as an investment.  But I think I see\nthe way to doing something at once in Mexico, and I should like to feel\nthat I had something more than a drummer's interest in the venture.\"\n\nThe men sat looking into each other's eyes.  Then Lapham leaned back in\nhis chair, and rubbed his hand hard and slowly over his face.  His\nfeatures were still twisted with some strong emotion when he took it\naway.  \"Your family know about this?\"\n\n\"My Uncle James knows.\"\n\n\"He thinks it would be a good plan for you?\"\n\n\"He thought that by this time I ought to be able to trust my own\njudgment.\"\n\n\"Do you suppose I could see your uncle at his office?\"\n\n\"I imagine he's there.\"\n\n\"Well, I want to have a talk with him, one of these days.\" He sat\npondering a while, and then rose, and went with Corey to his door.  \"I\nguess I shan't change my mind about taking you into the business in\nthat way,\" he said coldly.  \"If there was any reason why I shouldn't at\nfirst, there's more now.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir,\" answered the young man, and went to close his desk.\nThe outer office was empty; but while Corey was putting his papers in\norder it was suddenly invaded by two women, who pushed by the\nprotesting porter on the stairs and made their way towards Lapham's\nroom.  One of them was Miss Dewey, the type-writer girl, and the other\nwas a woman whom she would resemble in face and figure twenty years\nhence, if she led a life of hard work varied by paroxysms of hard\ndrinking.\n\n\"That his room, Z'rilla?\" asked this woman, pointing towards Lapham's\ndoor with a hand that had not freed itself from the fringe of dirty\nshawl under which it had hung.  She went forward without waiting for\nthe answer, but before she could reach it the door opened, and Lapham\nstood filling its space.\n\n\"Look here, Colonel Lapham!\" began the woman, in a high key of\nchallenge.  \"I want to know if this is the way you're goin' back on me\nand Z'rilla?\"\n\n\"What do you want?\" asked Lapham.\n\n\"What do I want? What do you s'pose I want? I want the money to pay my\nmonth's rent; there ain't a bite to eat in the house; and I want some\nmoney to market.\"\n\nLapham bent a frown on the woman, under which she shrank back a step.\n\"You've taken the wrong way to get it.  Clear out!\"\n\n\"I WON'T clear out!\" said the woman, beginning to whimper.\n\n\"Corey!\" said Lapham, in the peremptory voice of a master,--he had\nseemed so indifferent to Corey's presence that the young man thought he\nmust have forgotten he was there,--\"Is Dennis anywhere round?\"\n\n\"Yissor,\" said Dennis, answering for himself from the head of the\nstairs, and appearing in the ware-room.\n\nLapham spoke to the woman again.  \"Do you want I should call a hack, or\ndo you want I should call an officer?\"\n\nThe woman began to cry into an end of her shawl.  \"I don't know what\nwe're goin' to do.\"\n\n\"You're going to clear out,\" said Lapham.  \"Call a hack, Dennis.  If\nyou ever come here again, I'll have you arrested.  Mind that! Zerrilla,\nI shall want you early to-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said the girl meekly; she and her mother shrank out after\nthe porter.\n\nLapham shut his door without a word.\n\nAt lunch the next day Walker made himself amends for Corey's reticence\nby talking a great deal.  He talked about Lapham, who seemed to have,\nmore than ever since his apparent difficulties began, the fascination\nof an enigma for his book-keeper, and he ended by asking, \"Did you see\nthat little circus last night?\"\n\n\"What little circus?\" asked Corey in his turn.\n\n\"Those two women and the old man.  Dennis told me about it.  I told him\nif he liked his place he'd better keep his mouth shut.\"\n\n\"That was very good advice,\" said Corey.\n\n\"Oh, all right, if you don't want to talk.  Don't know as I should in\nyour place,\" returned Walker, in the easy security he had long felt\nthat Corey had no intention of putting on airs with him.  \"But I'll\ntell you what: the old man can't expect it of everybody.  If he keeps\nthis thing up much longer, it's going to be talked about.  You can't\nhave a woman walking into your place of business, and trying to\nbulldoze you before your porter, without setting your porter to\nthinking.  And the last thing you want a porter to do is to think; for\nwhen a porter thinks, he thinks wrong.\"\n\n\"I don't see why even a porter couldn't think right about that affair,\"\nreplied Corey.  \"I don't know who the woman was, though I believe she\nwas Miss Dewey's mother; but I couldn't see that Colonel Lapham showed\nanything but a natural resentment of her coming to him in that way.  I\nshould have said she was some rather worthless person whom he'd been\nbefriending, and that she had presumed upon his kindness.\"\n\n\"Is that so? What do you think of his never letting Miss Dewey's name\ngo on the books?\"\n\n\"That it's another proof it's a sort of charity of his.  That's the\nonly way to look at it.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'M all right.\" Walker lighted a cigar and began to smoke, with\nhis eyes closed to a fine straight line.  \"It won't do for a\nbook-keeper to think wrong, any more than a porter, I suppose.  But I\nguess you and I don't think very different about this thing.\"\n\n\"Not if you think as I do,\" replied Corey steadily; \"and I know you\nwould do that if you had seen the 'circus' yourself.  A man doesn't\ntreat people who have a disgraceful hold upon him as he treated them.\"\n\n\"It depends upon who he is,\" said Walker, taking his cigar from his\nmouth.  \"I never said the old man was afraid of anything.\"\n\n\"And character,\" continued Corey, disdaining to touch the matter\nfurther, except in generalities, \"must go for something.  If it's to be\nthe prey of mere accident and appearance, then it goes for nothing.\"\n\n\"Accidents will happen in the best regulated families,\" said Walker,\nwith vulgar, good-humoured obtuseness that filled Corey with\nindignation.  Nothing, perhaps, removed his matter-of-fact nature\nfurther from the commonplace than a certain generosity of instinct,\nwhich I should not be ready to say was always infallible.\n\nThat evening it was Miss Dewey's turn to wait for speech with Lapham\nafter the others were gone.  He opened his door at her knock, and stood\nlooking at her with a worried air.  \"Well, what do you want, Zerrilla?\"\nhe asked, with a sort of rough kindness.\n\n\"I want to know what I'm going to do about Hen.  He's back again; and\nhe and mother have made it up, and they both got to drinking last night\nafter I went home, and carried on so that the neighbours came in.\"\n\nLapham passed his hand over his red and heated face.  \"I don't know\nwhat I'm going to do.  You're twice the trouble that my own family is,\nnow.  But I know what I'd do, mighty quick, if it wasn't for you,\nZerrilla,\" he went on relentingly.  \"I'd shut your mother up\nsomewheres, and if I could get that fellow off for a three years'\nvoyage----\"\n\n\"I declare,\" said Miss Dewey, beginning to whimper, \"it seems as if he\ncame back just so often to spite me.  He's never gone more than a year\nat the furthest, and you can't make it out habitual drunkenness,\neither, when it's just sprees.  I'm at my wit's end.\"\n\n\"Oh, well, you mustn't cry around here,\" said Lapham soothingly.\n\n\"I know it,\" said Miss Dewey.  \"If I could get rid of Hen, I could\nmanage well enough with mother.  Mr. Wemmel would marry me if I could\nget the divorce.  He's said so over and over again.\"\n\n\"I don't know as I like that very well,\" said Lapham, frowning.  \"I\ndon't know as I want you should get married in any hurry again.  I\ndon't know as I like your going with anybody else just yet.\"\n\n\"Oh, you needn't be afraid but what it'll be all right.  It'll be the\nbest thing all round, if I can marry him.\"\n\n\"Well!\" said Lapham impatiently; \"I can't think about it now.  I\nsuppose they've cleaned everything out again?\"\n\n\"Yes, they have,\" said Zerrilla; \"there isn't a cent left.\"\n\n\"You're a pretty expensive lot,\" said Lapham.  \"Well, here!\" He took\nout his pocket-book and gave her a note.  \"I'll be round to-night and\nsee what can be done.\"\n\nHe shut himself into his room again, and Zerrilla dried her tears, put\nthe note into her bosom, and went her way.\n\nLapham kept the porter nearly an hour later.  It was then six o'clock,\nthe hour at which the Laphams usually had tea; but all custom had been\nbroken up with him during the past months, and he did not go home now.\nHe determined, perhaps in the extremity in which a man finds relief in\ncombating one care with another, to keep his promise to Miss Dewey, and\nat the moment when he might otherwise have been sitting down at his own\ntable he was climbing the stairs to her lodging in the old-fashioned\ndwelling which had been portioned off into flats.  It was in a region\nof depots, and of the cheap hotels, and \"ladies' and gents'\"\ndining-rooms, and restaurants with bars, which abound near depots; and\nLapham followed to Miss Dewey's door a waiter from one of these, who\nbore on a salver before him a supper covered with a napkin.  Zerrilla\nhad admitted them, and at her greeting a young fellow in the shabby\nshore-suit of a sailor, buttoning imperfectly over the nautical blue\nflannel of his shirt, got up from where he had been sitting, on one\nside of the stove, and stood infirmly on his feet, in token of\nreceiving the visitor.  The woman who sat on the other side did not\nrise, but began a shrill, defiant apology.\n\n\"Well, I don't suppose but what you'll think we're livin' on the fat o'\nthe land, right straight along, all the while.  But it's just like\nthis.  When that child came in from her work, she didn't seem to have\nthe spirit to go to cookin' anything, and I had such a bad night last\nnight I was feelin' all broke up, and s'd I, what's the use, anyway? By\nthe time the butcher's heaved in a lot o' bone, and made you pay for\nthe suet he cuts away, it comes to the same thing, and why not GIT it\nfrom the rest'rant first off, and save the cost o' your fire? s'd I.\"\n\n\"What have you got there under your apron? A bottle?\" demanded Lapham,\nwho stood with his hat on and his hands in his pockets, indifferent\nalike to the ineffective reception of the sailor and the chair Zerrilla\nhad set him.\n\n\"Well, yes, it's a bottle,\" said the woman, with an assumption of\nvirtuous frankness.  \"It's whisky; I got to have something to rub my\nrheumatism with.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" grumbled Lapham.  \"You've been rubbing HIS rheumatism too, I\nsee.\"\n\nHe twisted his head in the direction of the sailor, now softly and\nrhythmically waving to and fro on his feet.\n\n\"He hain't had a drop to-day in THIS house!\" cried the woman.\n\n\"What are you doing around here?\" said Lapham, turning fiercely upon\nhim.  \"You've got no business ashore.  Where's your ship? Do you think\nI'm going to let you come here and eat your wife out of house and home,\nand then give money to keep the concern going?\"\n\n\"Just the very words I said when he first showed his face here,\nyist'day. Didn't I, Z'rilla?\" said the woman, eagerly joining in the\nrebuke of her late boon companion.  \"You got no business here, Hen, s'd\nI. You can't come here to live on me and Z'rilla, s'd I. You want to go\nback to your ship, s'd I. That's what I said.\"\n\nThe sailor mumbled, with a smile of tipsy amiability for Lapham,\nsomething about the crew being discharged.\n\n\"Yes,\" the woman broke in, \"that's always the way with these coasters.\nWhy don't you go off on some them long v'y'ges? s'd I. It's pretty hard\nwhen Mr. Wemmel stands ready to marry Z'rilla and provide a comfortable\nhome for us both--I hain't got a great many years more to live, and I\nSHOULD like to get some satisfaction out of 'em, and not be beholden\nand dependent all my days,--to have Hen, here, blockin' the way.  I\ntell him there'd be more money for him in the end; but he can't seem to\nmake up his mind to it.\"\n\n\"Well, now, look here,\" said Lapham.  \"I don't care anything about all\nthat.  It's your own business, and I'm not going to meddle with it.\nBut it's my business who lives off me; and so I tell you all three, I'm\nwilling to take care of Zerrilla, and I'm willing to take care of her\nmother----\"\n\n\"I guess if it hadn't been for that child's father,\" the mother\ninterpolated, \"you wouldn't been here to tell the tale, Colonel Lapham.\"\n\n\"I know all about that,\" said Lapham.  \"But I'll tell you what, Mr.\nDewey, I'm not going to support YOU.\"\n\n\"I don't see what Hen's done,\" said the old woman impartially.\n\n\"He hasn't done anything, and I'm going to stop it.  He's got to get a\nship, and he's got to get out of this.  And Zerrilla needn't come back\nto work till he does.  I'm done with you all.\"\n\n\"Well, I vow,\" said the mother, \"if I ever heard anything like it!\nDidn't that child's father lay down his life for you? Hain't you said\nit yourself a hundred times?  And don't she work for her money, and\nslave for it mornin', noon, and night? You talk as if we was beholden\nto you for the very bread in our mouths.  I guess if it hadn't been for\nJim, you wouldn't been here crowin' over us.\"\n\n\"You mind what I say.  I mean business this time,\" said Lapham, turning\nto the door.\n\nThe woman rose and followed him, with her bottle in her hand.  \"Say,\nColonel! what should you advise Z'rilla to do about Mr. Wemmel? I tell\nher there ain't any use goin' to the trouble to git a divorce without\nshe's sure about him.  Don't you think we'd ought to git him to sign a\npaper, or something, that he'll marry her if she gits it? I don't like\nto have things going at loose ends the way they are.  It ain't sense.\nIt ain't right.\"\n\nLapham made no answer to the mother anxious for her child's future, and\nconcerned for the moral questions involved.  He went out and down the\nstairs, and on the pavement at the lower door he almost struck against\nRogers, who had a bag in his hand, and seemed to be hurrying towards\none of the depots.  He halted a little, as if to speak to Lapham; but\nLapham turned his back abruptly upon him, and took the other direction.\n\nThe days were going by in a monotony of adversity to him, from which he\ncould no longer escape, even at home.  He attempted once or twice to\ntalk of his troubles to his wife, but she repulsed him sharply; she\nseemed to despise and hate him; but he set himself doggedly to make a\nconfession to her, and he stopped her one night, as she came into the\nroom where he sat--hastily upon some errand that was to take her\ndirectly away again.\n\n\"Persis, there's something I've got to tell you.\"\n\nShe stood still, as if fixed against her will, to listen.\n\n\"I guess you know something about it already, and I guess it set you\nagainst me.\"\n\n\"Oh, I guess not, Colonel Lapham.  You go your way, and I go mine.\nThat's all.\"\n\nShe waited for him to speak, listening with a cold, hard smile on her\nface.\n\n\"I don't say it to make favour with you, because I don't want you to\nspare me, and I don't ask you; but I got into it through Milton K.\nRogers.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Mrs. Lapham contemptuously.\n\n\"I always felt the way I said about it--that it wa'n't any better than\ngambling, and I say so now.  It's like betting on the turn of a card;\nand I give you my word of honour, Persis, that I never was in it at all\ntill that scoundrel began to load me up with those wild-cat securities\nof his.  Then it seemed to me as if I ought to try to do something to\nget somewhere even.  I know it's no excuse; but watching the market to\nsee what the infernal things were worth from day to day, and seeing it\ngo up, and seeing it go down, was too much for me; and, to make a long\nstory short, I began to buy and sell on a margin--just what I told you\nI never would do.  I seemed to make something--I did make something;\nand I'd have stopped, I do believe, if I could have reached the figure\nI'd set in my own mind to start with; but I couldn't fetch it.  I began\nto lose, and then I began to throw good money after bad, just as I\nalways did with everything that Rogers ever came within a mile of.\nWell, what's the use? I lost the money that would have carried me out\nof this, and I shouldn't have had to shut down the Works, or sell the\nhouse, or----\"\n\nLapham stopped.  His wife, who at first had listened with\nmystification, and then dawning incredulity, changing into a look of\nrelief that was almost triumph, lapsed again into severity.  \"Silas\nLapham, if you was to die the next minute, is this what you started to\ntell me?\"\n\n\"Why, of course it is.  What did you suppose I started to tell you?\"\n\n\"And--look me in the eyes!--you haven't got anything else on your mind\nnow?\"\n\n\"No! There's trouble enough, the Lord knows; but there's nothing else\nto tell you.  I suppose Pen gave you a hint about it.  I dropped\nsomething to her.  I've been feeling bad about it, Persis, a good\nwhile, but I hain't had the heart to speak of it.  I can't expect you\nto say you like it.  I've been a fool, I'll allow, and I've been\nsomething worse, if you choose to say so; but that's all.  I haven't\nhurt anybody but myself--and you and the children.\"\n\nMrs. Lapham rose and said, with her face from him, as she turned\ntowards the door, \"It's all right, Silas.  I shan't ever bring it up\nagainst you.\"\n\nShe fled out of the room, but all that evening she was very sweet with\nhim, and seemed to wish in all tacit ways to atone for her past\nunkindness.\n\nShe made him talk of his business, and he told her of Corey's offer,\nand what he had done about it.  She did not seem to care for his part\nin it, however; at which Lapham was silently disappointed a little, for\nhe would have liked her to praise him.\n\n\"He did it on account of Pen!\"\n\n\"Well, he didn't insist upon it, anyway,\" said Lapham, who must have\nobscurely expected that Corey would recognise his own magnanimity by\nrepeating his offer.  If the doubt that follows a self-devoted\naction--the question whether it was not after all a needless folly--is\nmixed, as it was in Lapham's case, with the vague belief that we might\nhave done ourselves a good turn without great risk of hurting any one\nelse by being a little less unselfish, it becomes a regret that is hard\nto bear.  Since Corey spoke to him, some things had happened that gave\nLapham hope again.\n\n\"I'm going to tell her about it,\" said his wife, and she showed herself\nimpatient to make up for the time she had lost.  \"Why didn't you tell\nme before, Silas?\"\n\n\"I didn't know we were on speaking terms before,\" said Lapham sadly.\n\n\"Yes, that's true,\" she admitted, with a conscious flush.  \"I hope he\nwon't think Pen's known about it all this while.\"\n\n\n\nXXIV.\n\n\nTHAT evening James Bellingham came to see Corey after dinner, and went\nto find him in his own room.\n\n\"I've come at the instance of Colonel Lapham,\" said the uncle.  \"He was\nat my office to-day, and I had a long talk with him.  Did you know that\nhe was in difficulties?\"\n\n\"I fancied that he was in some sort of trouble.  And I had the\nbook-keeper's conjectures--he doesn't really know much about it.\"\n\n\"Well, he thinks it time--on all accounts--that you should know how he\nstands, and why he declined that proposition of yours.  I must say he\nhas behaved very well--like a gentleman.\"\n\n\"I'm not surprised.\"\n\n\"I am.  It's hard to behave like a gentleman where your interest is\nvitally concerned.  And Lapham doesn't strike me as a man who's in the\nhabit of acting from the best in him always.\"\n\n\"Do any of us?\" asked Corey.\n\n\"Not all of us, at any rate,\" said Bellingham.  \"It must have cost him\nsomething to say no to you, for he's just in that state when he\nbelieves that this or that chance, however small, would save him.\"\n\nCorey was silent.  \"Is he really in such a bad way?\"\n\n\"It's hard to tell just where he stands.  I suspect that a hopeful\ntemperament and fondness for round numbers have always caused him to\nset his figures beyond his actual worth.  I don't say that he's been\ndishonest about it, but he's had a loose way of estimating his assets;\nhe's reckoned his wealth on the basis of his capital, and some of his\ncapital is borrowed.  He's lost heavily by some of the recent failures,\nand there's been a terrible shrinkage in his values.  I don't mean\nmerely in the stock of paint on hand, but in a kind of competition\nwhich has become very threatening.  You know about that West Virginian\npaint?\"\n\nCorey nodded.\n\n\"Well, he tells me that they've struck a vein of natural gas out there\nwhich will enable them to make as good a paint as his own at a cost of\nmanufacturing so low that they can undersell him everywhere.  If this\nproves to be the case, it will not only drive his paint out of the\nmarket, but will reduce the value of his Works--the whole plant--at\nLapham to a merely nominal figure.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Corey dejectedly.  \"I've understood that he had put a\ngreat deal of money into his Works.\"\n\n\"Yes, and he estimated his mine there at a high figure.  Of course it\nwill be worth little or nothing if the West Virginia paint drives his\nout.  Then, besides, Lapham has been into several things outside of his\nown business, and, like a good many other men who try outside things,\nhe's kept account of them himself; and he's all mixed up about them.\nHe's asked me to look into his affairs with him, and I've promised to\ndo so.  Whether he can be tided over his difficulties remains to be\nseen.  I'm afraid it will take a good deal of money to do it--a great\ndeal more than he thinks, at least.  He believes comparatively little\nwould do it.  I think differently.  I think that anything less than a\ngreat deal would be thrown away on him.  If it were merely a question\nof a certain sum--even a large sum--to keep him going, it might be\nmanaged; but it's much more complicated.  And, as I say, it must have\nbeen a trial to him to refuse your offer.\"\n\nThis did not seem to be the way in which Bellingham had meant to\nconclude.  But he said no more; and Corey made him no response.\n\nHe remained pondering the case, now hopefully, now doubtfully, and\nwondering, whatever his mood was, whether Penelope knew anything of the\nfact with which her mother went nearly at the same moment to acquaint\nher.\n\n\"Of course, he's done it on your account,\" Mrs. Lapham could not help\nsaying.\n\n\"Then he was very silly.  Does he think I would let him give father\nmoney? And if father lost it for him, does he suppose it would make it\nany easier for me? I think father acted twice as well.  It was very\nsilly.\"\n\nIn repeating the censure, her look was not so severe as her tone; she\neven smiled a little, and her mother reported to her father that she\nacted more like herself than she had yet since Corey's offer.\n\n\"I think, if he was to repeat his offer, she would have him now,\" said\nMrs. Lapham.\n\n\"Well, I'll let her know if he does,\" said the Colonel.\n\n\"I guess he won't do it to you!\" she cried.\n\n\"Who else will he do it to?\" he demanded.\n\nThey perceived that they had each been talking of a different offer.\n\nAfter Lapham went to his business in the morning the postman brought\nanother letter from Irene, which was full of pleasant things that were\nhappening to her; there was a great deal about her cousin Will, as she\ncalled him.  At the end she had written, \"Tell Pen I don't want she\nshould be foolish.\" \"There!\" said Mrs. Lapham.  \"I guess it's going to\ncome out right, all round;\" and it seemed as if even the Colonel's\ndifficulties were past.  \"When your father gets through this, Pen,\" she\nasked impulsively, \"what shall you do?\"\n\n\"What have you been telling Irene about me?\"\n\n\"Nothing much.  What should you do?\"\n\n\"It would be a good deal easier to say what I should do if father\ndidn't,\" said the girl.\n\n\"I know you think it was nice in him to make your father that offer,\"\nurged the mother.\n\n\"It was nice, yes; but it was silly,\" said the girl.  \"Most nice things\nare silly, I suppose,\" she added.\n\nShe went to her room and wrote a letter.  It was very long, and very\ncarefully written; and when she read it over, she tore it into small\npieces.  She wrote another one, short and hurried, and tore that up\ntoo.  Then she went back to her mother, in the family room, and asked\nto see Irene's letter, and read it over to herself.  \"Yes, she seems to\nbe having a good time,\" she sighed.  \"Mother, do you think I ought to\nlet Mr. Corey know that I know about it?\"\n\n\"Well, I should think it would be a pleasure to him,\" said Mrs. Lapham\njudicially.\n\n\"I'm not so sure of that the way I should have to tell him.  I should\nbegin by giving him a scolding.  Of course, he meant well by it, but\ncan't you see that it wasn't very flattering! How did he expect it\nwould change me?\"\n\n\"I don't believe he ever thought of that.\"\n\n\"Don't you? Why?\"\n\n\"Because you can see that he isn't one of that kind.  He might want to\nplease you without wanting to change you by what he did.\"\n\n\"Yes. He must have known that nothing would change me,--at least,\nnothing that he could do.  I thought of that.  I shouldn't like him to\nfeel that I couldn't appreciate it, even if I did think it was silly.\nShould you write to him?\"\n\n\"I don't see why not.\"\n\n\"It would be too pointed.  No, I shall just let it go.  I wish he\nhadn't done it.\"\n\n\"Well, he has done it.\" \"And I've tried to write to him about it--two\nletters: one so humble and grateful that it couldn't stand up on its\nedge, and the other so pert and flippant.  Mother, I wish you could\nhave seen those two letters! I wish I had kept them to look at if I\never got to thinking I had any sense again.  They would take the\nconceit out of me.\"\n\n\"What's the reason he don't come here any more?\"\n\n\"Doesn't he come?\" asked Penelope in turn, as if it were something she\nhad not noticed particularly.\n\n\"You'd ought to know.\"\n\n\"Yes.\" She sat silent a while.  \"If he doesn't come, I suppose it's\nbecause he's offended at something I did.\"\n\n\"What did you do?\"\n\n\"Nothing. I--wrote to him--a little while ago.  I suppose it was very\nblunt, but I didn't believe he would be angry at it.  But this--this\nthat he's done shows he was angry, and that he wasn't just seizing the\nfirst chance to get out of it.\"\n\n\"What have you done, Pen?\" demanded her mother sharply.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know.  All the mischief in the world, I suppose.  I'll\ntell you.  When you first told me that father was in trouble with his\nbusiness, I wrote to him not to come any more till I let him.  I said I\ncouldn't tell him why, and he hasn't been here since.  I'm sure I don't\nknow what it means.\"\n\nHer mother looked at her with angry severity.  \"Well, Penelope Lapham!\nFor a sensible child, you ARE the greatest goose I ever saw.  Did you\nthink he would come here and SEE if you wouldn't let him come?\"\n\n\"He might have written,\" urged the girl.\n\nHer mother made that despairing \"Tchk!\" with her tongue, and fell back\nin her chair.  \"I should have DESPISED him if he had written.  He's\nacted just exactly right, and you--you've acted--I don't know HOW\nyou've acted.  I'm ashamed of you.  A girl that could be so sensible\nfor her sister, and always say and do just the right thing, and then\nwhen it comes to herself to be such a DISGUSTING simpleton!\"\n\n\"I thought I ought to break with him at once, and not let him suppose\nthat there was any hope for him or me if father was poor.  It was my\none chance, in this whole business, to do anything heroic, and I jumped\nat it.  You mustn't think, because I can laugh at it now, that I wasn't\nin earnest, mother! I WAS--dead! But the Colonel has gone to ruin so\ngradually, that he's spoilt everything.  I expected that he would be\nbankrupt the next day, and that then HE would understand what I meant.\nBut to have it drag along for a fortnight seems to take all the heroism\nout of it, and leave it as flat!\" She looked at her mother with a smile\nthat shone through her tears, and a pathos that quivered round her\njesting lips.  \"It's easy enough to be sensible for other people.  But\nwhen it comes to myself, there I am! Especially, when I want to do what\nI oughtn't so much that it seems as if doing what I didn't want to do\nMUST be doing what I ought! But it's been a great success one way,\nmother.  It's helped me to keep up before the Colonel.  If it hadn't\nbeen for Mr. Corey's staying away, and my feeling so indignant with him\nfor having been badly treated by me, I shouldn't have been worth\nanything at all.\"\n\nThe tears started down her cheeks, but her mother said, \"Well, now, go\nalong, and write to him.  It don't matter what you say, much; and don't\nbe so very particular.\"\n\nHer third attempt at a letter pleased her scarcely better than the\nrest, but she sent it, though it seemed so blunt and awkward.  She\nwrote:--\n\n\nDEAR FRIEND,--I expected when I sent you that note, that you would\nunderstand, almost the next day, why I could not see you any more.  You\nmust know now, and you must not think that if anything happened to my\nfather, I should wish you to help him.  But that is no reason why I\nshould not thank you, and I do thank you, for offering.  It was like\nyou, I will say that.\n\nYours sincerely, PENELOPE LAPHAM.\n\n\nShe posted her letter, and he sent his reply in the evening, by hand:--\n\n\nDEAREST,--What I did was nothing, till you praised it.  Everything I\nhave and am is yours.  Won't you send a line by the bearer, to say that\nI may come to see you? I know how you feel; but I am sure that I can\nmake you think differently.  You must consider that I loved you without\na thought of your father's circumstances, and always shall.\n\nT. C.\n\n\nThe generous words were blurred to her eyes by the tears that sprang\ninto them.  But she could only write in answer:--\n\n\n\"Please do not come; I have made up my mind.  As long as this trouble\nis hanging over us, I cannot see you.  And if father is unfortunate,\nall is over between us.\"\n\n\nShe brought his letter to her mother, and told her what she had written\nin reply.  Her mother was thoughtful a while before she said, with a\nsigh, \"Well, I hope you've begun as you can carry out, Pen.\"\n\n\"Oh, I shall not have to carry out at all.  I shall not have to do\nanything.  That's one comfort--the only comfort.\" She went away to her\nown room, and when Mrs. Lapham told her husband of the affair, he was\nsilent at first, as she had been.  Then he said, \"I don't know as I\nshould have wanted her to done differently; I don't know as she could.\nIf I ever come right again, she won't have anything to feel meeching\nabout; and if I don't, I don't want she should be beholden to anybody.\nAnd I guess that's the way she feels.\"\n\nThe Coreys in their turn sat in judgment on the fact which their son\nfelt bound to bring to their knowledge.\n\n\"She has behaved very well,\" said Mrs. Corey, to whom her son had\nspoken.\n\n\"My dear,\" said her husband, with his laugh, \"she has behaved TOO well.\nIf she had studied the whole situation with the most artful eye to its\nmastery, she could not possibly have behaved better.\"\n\nThe process of Lapham's financial disintegration was like the course of\nsome chronic disorder, which has fastened itself upon the constitution,\nbut advances with continual reliefs, with apparent amelioration, and at\ntimes seems not to advance at all, when it gives hope of final recovery\nnot only to the sufferer, but to the eye of science itself.  There were\nmoments when James Bellingham, seeing Lapham pass this crisis and that,\nbegan to fancy that he might pull through altogether; and at these\nmoments, when his adviser could not oppose anything but experience and\nprobability to the evidence of the fact, Lapham was buoyant with\ncourage, and imparted his hopefulness to his household.  Our theory of\ndisaster, of sorrow, of affliction, borrowed from the poets and\nnovelists, is that it is incessant; but every passage in our own lives\nand in the lives of others, so far as we have witnessed them, teaches\nus that this is false.  The house of mourning is decorously darkened to\nthe world, but within itself it is also the house of laughing.  Bursts\nof gaiety, as heartfelt as its grief, relieve the gloom, and the\nstricken survivors have their jests together, in which the thought of\nthe dead is tenderly involved, and a fond sense, not crazier than many\nothers, of sympathy and enjoyment beyond the silence, justifies the\nsunnier mood before sorrow rushes back, deploring and despairing, and\nmaking it all up again with the conventional fitness of things.\nLapham's adversity had this quality in common with bereavement.  It was\nnot always like the adversity we figure in allegory; it had its moments\nof being like prosperity, and if upon the whole it was continual, it\nwas not incessant.  Sometimes there was a week of repeated reverses,\nwhen he had to keep his teeth set and to hold on hard to all his\nhopefulness; and then days came of negative result or slight success,\nwhen he was full of his jokes at the tea-table, and wanted to go to the\ntheatre, or to do something to cheer Penelope up.  In some miraculous\nway, by some enormous stroke of success which should eclipse the\nbrightest of his past prosperity, he expected to do what would\nreconcile all difficulties, not only in his own affairs, but in hers\ntoo.  \"You'll see,\" he said to his wife; \"it's going to come out all\nright.  Irene'll fix it up with Bill's boy, and then she'll be off\nPen's mind; and if things go on as they've been going for the last two\ndays, I'm going to be in a position to do the favours myself, and Pen\ncan feel that SHE'S makin' a sacrifice, and then I guess may be she'll\ndo it.  If things turn out as I expect now, and times ever do get any\nbetter generally, I can show Corey that I appreciate his offer.  I can\noffer him the partnership myself then.\"\n\nEven in the other moods, which came when everything had been going\nwrong, and there seemed no way out of the net, there were points of\nconsolation to Lapham and his wife.  They rejoiced that Irene was safe\nbeyond the range of their anxieties, and they had a proud satisfaction\nthat there had been no engagement between Corey and Penelope, and that\nit was she who had forbidden it.  In the closeness of interest and\nsympathy in which their troubles had reunited them, they confessed to\neach other that nothing would have been more galling to their pride\nthan the idea that Lapham should not have been able to do everything\nfor his daughter that the Coreys might have expected.  Whatever\nhappened now, the Coreys could not have it to say that the Laphams had\ntried to bring any such thing about.\n\nBellingham had lately suggested an assignment to Lapham, as the best\nway out of his difficulties.  It was evident that he had not the money\nto meet his liabilities at present, and that he could not raise it\nwithout ruinous sacrifices, that might still end in ruin after all.  If\nhe made the assignment, Bellingham argued, he could gain time and make\nterms; the state of things generally would probably improve, since it\ncould not be worse, and the market, which he had glutted with his\npaint, might recover and he could start again.  Lapham had not agreed\nwith him.  When his reverses first began it had seemed easy for him to\ngive up everything, to let the people he owed take all, so only they\nwould let him go out with clean hands; and he had dramatised this\nfeeling in his talk with his wife, when they spoke together of the\nmills on the G. L. & P. But ever since then it had been growing harder,\nand he could not consent even to seem to do it now in the proposed\nassignment.  He had not found other men so very liberal or faithful\nwith him; a good many of them appeared to have combined to hunt him\ndown; a sense of enmity towards all his creditors asserted itself in\nhim; he asked himself why they should not suffer a little too.  Above\nall, he shrank from the publicity of the assignment.  It was open\nconfession that he had been a fool in some way; he could not bear to\nhave his family--his brother the judge, especially, to whom he had\nalways appeared the soul of business wisdom--think him imprudent or\nstupid.  He would make any sacrifice before it came to that.  He\ndetermined in parting with Bellingham to make the sacrifice which he\nhad oftenest in his mind, because it was the hardest, and to sell his\nnew house.  That would cause the least comment.  Most people would\nsimply think that he had got a splendid offer, and with his usual luck\nhad made a very good thing of it; others who knew a little more about\nhim would say that he was hauling in his horns, but they could not\nblame him; a great many other men were doing the same in those hard\ntimes--the shrewdest and safest men: it might even have a good effect.\nHe went straight from Bellingham's office to the real-estate broker in\nwhose hands he meant to put his house, for he was not the sort of man\nto shilly-shally when he had once made up his mind.  But he found it\nhard to get his voice up out of his throat, when he said he guessed he\nwould get the broker to sell that new house of his on the water side of\nBeacon.  The broker answered cheerfully, yes; he supposed Colonel\nLapham knew it was a pretty dull time in real estate?  and Lapham said\nyes, he knew that, but he should not sell at a sacrifice, and he did\nnot care to have the broker name him or describe the house definitely\nunless parties meant business.  Again the broker said yes; and he\nadded, as a joke Lapham would appreciate, that he had half a dozen\nhouses on the water side of Beacon, on the same terms; that nobody\nwanted to be named or to have his property described.\n\nIt did, in fact, comfort Lapham a little to find himself in the same\nboat with so many others; he smiled grimly, and said in his turn, yes,\nhe guessed that was about the size of it with a good many people.  But\nhe had not the heart to tell his wife what he had done, and he sat\ntaciturn that whole evening, without even going over his accounts, and\nwent early to bed, where he lay tossing half the night before he fell\nasleep.  He slept at last only upon the promise he made himself that he\nwould withdraw the house from the broker's hands; but he went heavily\nto his own business in the morning without doing so.  There was no such\nrush, anyhow, he reflected bitterly; there would be time to do that a\nmonth later, probably.\n\nIt struck him with a sort of dismay when a boy came with a note from a\nbroker, saying that a party who had been over the house in the fall had\ncome to him to know whether it could be bought, and was willing to pay\nthe cost of the house up to the time he had seen it.  Lapham took\nrefuge in trying to think who the party could be; he concluded that it\nmust have been somebody who had gone over it with the architect, and he\ndid not like that; but he was aware that this was not an answer to the\nbroker, and he wrote that he would give him an answer in the morning.\n\nNow that it had come to the point, it did not seem to him that he could\npart with the house.  So much of his hope for himself and his children\nhad gone into it that the thought of selling it made him tremulous and\nsick.  He could not keep about his work steadily, and with his nerves\nshaken by want of sleep, and the shock of this sudden and unexpected\nquestion, he left his office early, and went over to look at the house\nand try to bring himself to some conclusion here.  The long procession\nof lamps on the beautiful street was flaring in the clear red of the\nsunset towards which it marched, and Lapham, with a lump in his throat,\nstopped in front of his house and looked at their multitude.  They were\nnot merely a part of the landscape; they were a part of his pride and\nglory, his success, his triumphant life's work which was fading into\nfailure in his helpless hands.  He ground his teeth to keep down that\nlump, but the moisture in his eyes blurred the lamps, and the keen pale\ncrimson against which it made them flicker.  He turned and looked up,\nas he had so often done, at the window-spaces, neatly glazed for the\nwinter with white linen, and recalled the night when he had stopped\nwith Irene before the house, and she had said that she should never\nlive there, and he had tried to coax her into courage about it.  There\nwas no such facade as that on the whole street, to his thinking.\nThrough his long talks with the architect, he had come to feel almost\nas intimately and fondly as the architect himself the satisfying\nsimplicity of the whole design and the delicacy of its detail.  It\nappealed to him as an exquisite bit of harmony appeals to the unlearned\near, and he recognised the difference between this fine work and the\nobstreperous pretentiousness of the many overloaded house-fronts which\nSeymour had made him notice for his instruction elsewhere on the Back\nBay.  Now, in the depths of his gloom, he tried to think what Italian\ncity it was where Seymour said he had first got the notion of treating\nbrick-work in that way.\n\nHe unlocked the temporary door with the key he always carried, so that\nhe could let himself in and out whenever he liked, and entered the\nhouse, dim and very cold with the accumulated frigidity of the whole\nwinter in it, and looking as if the arrest of work upon it had taken\nplace a thousand years before.  It smelt of the unpainted woods and the\nclean, hard surfaces of the plaster, where the experiments in\ndecoration had left it untouched; and mingled with these odours was\nthat of some rank pigments and metallic compositions which Seymour had\nused in trying to realise a certain daring novelty of finish, which had\nnot proved successful.  Above all, Lapham detected the peculiar odour\nof his own paint, with which the architect had been greatly interested\none day, when Lapham showed it to him at the office.  He had asked\nLapham to let him try the Persis Brand in realising a little idea he\nhad for the finish of Mrs. Lapham's room.  If it succeeded they could\ntell her what it was, for a surprise.\n\nLapham glanced at the bay-window in the reception-room, where he sat\nwith his girls on the trestles when Corey first came by; and then he\nexplored the whole house to the attic, in the light faintly admitted\nthrough the linen sashes.  The floors were strewn with shavings and\nchips which the carpenters had left, and in the music-room these had\nbeen blown into long irregular windrows by the draughts through a wide\nrent in the linen sash.  Lapham tried to pin it up, but failed, and\nstood looking out of it over the water.  The ice had left the river,\nand the low tide lay smooth and red in the light of the sunset.  The\nCambridge flats showed the sad, sodden yellow of meadows stripped bare\nafter a long sleep under snow; the hills, the naked trees, the spires\nand roofs had a black outline, as if they were objects in a landscape\nof the French school.\n\nThe whim seized Lapham to test the chimney in the music-room; it had\nbeen tried in the dining-room below, and in his girls' fireplaces\nabove, but here the hearth was still clean.  He gathered some shavings\nand blocks together, and kindled them, and as the flame mounted gaily\nfrom them, he pulled up a nail-keg which he found there and sat down to\nwatch it.  Nothing could have been better; the chimney was a perfect\nsuccess; and as Lapham glanced out of the torn linen sash he said to\nhimself that that party, whoever he was, who had offered to buy his\nhouse might go to the devil; he would never sell it as long as he had a\ndollar.  He said that he should pull through yet; and it suddenly came\ninto his mind that, if he could raise the money to buy out those West\nVirginia fellows, he should be all right, and would have the whole game\nin his own hand.  He slapped himself on the thigh, and wondered that he\nhad never thought of that before; and then, lighting a cigar with a\nsplinter from the fire, he sat down again to work the scheme out in his\nown mind.  He did not hear the feet heavily stamping up the stairs, and\ncoming towards the room where he sat; and the policeman to whom the\nfeet belonged had to call out to him, smoking at his chimney-corner,\nwith his back turned to the door, \"Hello! what are you doing here?\"\n\n\"What's that to you?\" retorted Lapham, wheeling half round on his\nnail-keg.\n\n\"I'll show you,\" said the officer, advancing upon him, and then\nstopping short as he recognised him.  \"Why, Colonel Lapham! I thought\nit was some tramp got in here!\"\n\n\"Have a cigar?\" said Lapham hospitably.  \"Sorry there ain't another\nnail-keg.\"\n\nThe officer took the cigar.  \"I'll smoke it outside.  I've just come\non, and I can't stop.  Tryin' your chimney?\"\n\n\"Yes, I thought I'd see how it would draw, in here.  It seems to go\nfirst-rate.\"\n\nThe policeman looked about him with an eye of inspection.  \"You want to\nget that linen window, there, mended up.\"\n\n\"Yes, I'll speak to the builder about that.  It can go for one night.\"\n\nThe policeman went to the window and failed to pin the linen together\nwhere Lapham had failed before.  \"I can't fix it.\" He looked round once\nmore, and saying, \"Well, good night,\" went out and down the stairs.\n\nLapham remained by the fire till he had smoked his cigar; then he rose\nand stamped upon the embers that still burned with his heavy boots, and\nwent home.  He was very cheerful at supper.  He told his wife that he\nguessed he had a sure thing of it now, and in another twenty-four hours\nhe should tell her just how.  He made Penelope go to the theatre with\nhim, and when they came out, after the play, the night was so fine that\nhe said they must walk round by the new house and take a look at it in\nthe starlight.  He said he had been there before he came home, and\ntried Seymour's chimney in the music-room, and it worked like a charm.\n\nAs they drew near Beacon Street they were aware of unwonted stir and\ntumult, and presently the still air transmitted a turmoil of sound,\nthrough which a powerful and incessant throbbing made itself felt.  The\nsky had reddened above them, and turning the corner at the Public\nGarden, they saw a black mass of people obstructing the perspective of\nthe brightly-lighted street, and out of this mass a half-dozen engines,\nwhose strong heart-beats had already reached them, sent up volumes of\nfire-tinged smoke and steam from their funnels.  Ladders were planted\nagainst the facade of a building, from the roof of which a mass of\nflame burnt smoothly upward, except where here and there it seemed to\npull contemptuously away from the heavy streams of water which the\nfiremen, clinging like great beetles to their ladders, poured in upon\nit.\n\nLapham had no need to walk down through the crowd, gazing and\ngossiping, with shouts and cries and hysterical laughter, before the\nburning house, to make sure that it was his.\n\n\"I guess I done it, Pen,\" was all he said.\n\nAmong the people who were looking at it were a party who seemed to have\nrun out from dinner in some neighbouring house; the ladies were\nfantastically wrapped up, as if they had flung on the first things they\ncould seize.\n\n\"Isn't it perfectly magnificent!\" cried a pretty girl.  \"I wouldn't\nhave missed it on any account.  Thank you so much, Mr. Symington, for\nbringing us out!\"\n\n\"Ah, I thought you'd like it,\" said this Mr. Symington, who must have\nbeen the host; \"and you can enjoy it without the least compunction,\nMiss Delano, for I happen to know that the house belongs to a man who\ncould afford to burn one up for you once a year.\"\n\n\"Oh, do you think he would, if I came again?\"\n\n\"I haven't the least doubt of it.  We don't do things by halves in\nBoston.\"\n\n\"He ought to have had a coat of his noncombustible paint on it,\" said\nanother gentleman of the party.\n\nPenelope pulled her father away toward the first carriage she could\nreach of a number that had driven up.  \"Here, father! get into this.\"\n\n\"No, no; I couldn't ride,\" he answered heavily, and he walked home in\nsilence.  He greeted his wife with, \"Well, Persis, our house is gone!\nAnd I guess I set it on fire myself;\" and while he rummaged among the\npapers in his desk, still with his coat and hat on, his wife got the\nfacts as she could from Penelope.  She did not reproach him.  Here was\na case in which his self-reproach must be sufficiently sharp without\nany edge from her.  Besides, her mind was full of a terrible thought.\n\n\"O Silas,\" she faltered, \"they'll think you set it on fire to get the\ninsurance!\"\n\nLapham was staring at a paper which he held in his hand.  \"I had a\nbuilder's risk on it, but it expired last week.  It's a dead loss.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank the merciful Lord!\" cried his wife.\n\n\"Merciful!\" said Lapham.  \"Well, it's a queer way of showing it.\"\n\nHe went to bed, and fell into the deep sleep which sometimes follows a\ngreat moral shock.  It was perhaps rather a torpor than a sleep.\n\n\n\nXXV.\n\n\nLAPHAM awoke confused, and in a kind of remoteness from the loss of the\nnight before, through which it loomed mistily.  But before he lifted\nhis head from the pillow, it gathered substance and weight against\nwhich it needed all his will to bear up and live.  In that moment he\nwished that he had not wakened, that he might never have wakened; but\nhe rose, and faced the day and its cares.\n\nThe morning papers brought the report of the fire, and the conjectured\nloss.  The reporters somehow had found out the fact that the loss fell\nentirely upon Lapham; they lighted up the hackneyed character of their\nstatements with the picturesque interest OF the coincidence that the\npolicy had expired only the week before; heaven knows how they knew it.\nThey said that nothing remained of the building but the walls; and\nLapham, on his way to business, walked up past the smoke-stained shell.\nThe windows looked like the eye-sockets of a skull down upon the\nblackened and trampled snow of the street; the pavement was a sheet of\nice, and the water from the engines had frozen, like streams of tears,\ndown the face of the house, and hung in icy tags from the window-sills\nand copings.\n\nHe gathered himself up as well as he could, and went on to his office.\nThe chance of retrieval that had flashed upon him, as he sat smoking by\nthat ruined hearth the evening before, stood him in such stead now as a\nsole hope may; and he said to himself that, having resolved not to sell\nhis house, he was no more crippled by its loss than he would have been\nby letting his money lie idle in it; what he might have raised by\nmortgage on it could be made up in some other way; and if they would\nsell he could still buy out the whole business of that West Virginia\ncompany, mines, plant, stock on hand, good-will, and everything, and\nunite it with his own.  He went early in the afternoon to see\nBellingham, whose expressions of condolence for his loss he cut short\nwith as much politeness as he knew how to throw into his impatience.\nBellingham seemed at first a little dazzled with the splendid courage\nof his scheme; it was certainly fine in its way; but then he began to\nhave his misgivings.\n\n\"I happen to know that they haven't got much money behind them,\" urged\nLapham.  \"They'll jump at an offer.\"\n\nBellingham shook his head.  \"If they can show profit on the old\nmanufacture, and prove they can make their paint still cheaper and\nbetter hereafter, they can have all the money they want.  And it will\nbe very difficult for you to raise it if you're threatened by them.\nWith that competition, you know what your plant at Lapham would be\nworth, and what the shrinkage on your manufactured stock would be.\nBetter sell out to them,\" he concluded, \"if they will buy.\"\n\n\"There ain't money enough in this country to buy out my paint,\" said\nLapham, buttoning up his coat in a quiver of resentment.  \"Good\nafternoon, sir.\" Men are but grown-up boys after all.  Bellingham\nwatched this perversely proud and obstinate child fling petulantly out\nof his door, and felt a sympathy for him which was as truly kind as it\nwas helpless.\n\nBut Lapham was beginning to see through Bellingham, as he believed.\nBellingham was, in his way, part of that conspiracy by which Lapham's\ncreditors were trying to drive him to the wall.  More than ever now he\nwas glad that he had nothing to do with that cold-hearted,\nself-conceited race, and that the favours so far were all from his\nside.  He was more than ever determined to show them, every one of\nthem, high and low, that he and his children could get along without\nthem, and prosper and triumph without them.  He said to himself that if\nPenelope were engaged to Corey that very minute, he would make her\nbreak with him.\n\nHe knew what he should do now, and he was going to do it without loss\nof time.  He was going on to New York to see those West Virginia\npeople; they had their principal office there, and he intended to get\nat their ideas, and then he intended to make them an offer.  He managed\nthis business better than could possibly have been expected of a man in\nhis impassioned mood.  But when it came really to business, his\npractical instincts, alert and wary, came to his aid against the\npassions that lay in wait to betray after they ceased to dominate him.\nHe found the West Virginians full of zeal and hope, but in ten minutes\nhe knew that they had not yet tested their strength in the money\nmarket, and had not ascertained how much or how little capital they\ncould command.  Lapham himself, if he had had so much, would not have\nhesitated to put a million dollars into their business.  He saw, as\nthey did not see, that they had the game in their own hands, and that\nif they could raise the money to extend their business, they could ruin\nhim.  It was only a question of time, and he was on the ground first.\nHe frankly proposed a union of their interests.  He admitted that they\nhad a good thing, and that he should have to fight them hard; but he\nmeant to fight them to the death unless they could come to some sort of\nterms.  Now, the question was whether they had better go on and make a\nheavy loss for both sides by competition, or whether they had better\nform a partnership to run both paints and command the whole market.\nLapham made them three propositions, each of which was fair and open:\nto sell out to them altogether; to buy them out altogether; to join\nfacilities and forces with them, and go on in an invulnerable alliance.\nLet them name a figure at which they would buy, a figure at which they\nwould sell, a figure at which they would combine,--or, in other words,\nthe amount of capital they needed.\n\nThey talked all day, going out to lunch together at the Astor House,\nand sitting with their knees against the counter on a row of stools\nbefore it for fifteen minutes of reflection and deglutition, with their\nhats on, and then returning to the basement from which they emerged.\nThe West Virginia company's name was lettered in gilt on the wide low\nwindow, and its paint, in the form of ore, burnt, and mixed, formed a\ndisplay on the window shelf Lapham examined it and praised it; from\ntime to time they all recurred to it together; they sent out for some\nof Lapham's paint and compared it, the West Virginians admitting its\nformer superiority.  They were young fellows, and country persons, like\nLapham, by origin, and they looked out with the same amused, undaunted\nprovincial eyes at the myriad metropolitan legs passing on the pavement\nabove the level of their window.  He got on well with them.  At last,\nthey said what they would do.  They said it was nonsense to talk of\nbuying Lapham out, for they had not the money; and as for selling out,\nthey would not do it, for they knew they had a big thing.  But they\nwould as soon use his capital to develop it as anybody else's, and if\nhe could put in a certain sum for this purpose, they would go in with\nhim.  He should run the works at Lapham and manage the business in\nBoston, and they would run the works at Kanawha Falls and manage the\nbusiness in New York.  The two brothers with whom Lapham talked named\ntheir figure, subject to the approval of another brother at Kanawha\nFalls, to whom they would write, and who would telegraph his answer, so\nthat Lapham could have it inside of three days.  But they felt\nperfectly sure that he would approve; and Lapham started back on the\neleven o'clock train with an elation that gradually left him as he drew\nnear Boston, where the difficulties of raising this sum were to be over\ncome.  It seemed to him, then, that those fellows had put it up on him\npretty steep, but he owned to himself that they had a sure thing, and\nthat they were right in believing they could raise the same sum\nelsewhere; it would take all OF it, he admitted, to make their paint\npay on the scale they had the right to expect.  At their age, he would\nnot have done differently; but when he emerged, old, sore, and\nsleep-broken, from the sleeping-car in the Albany depot at Boston, he\nwished with a pathetic self-pity that they knew how a man felt at his\nage.  A year ago, six months ago, he would have laughed at the notion\nthat it would be hard to raise the money.  But he thought ruefully of\nthat immense stock of paint on hand, which was now a drug in the\nmarket, of his losses by Rogers and by the failures of other men, of\nthe fire that had licked up so many thousands in a few hours; he\nthought with bitterness of the tens of thousands that he had gambled\naway in stocks, and of the commissions that the brokers had pocketed\nwhether he won or lost; and he could not think of any securities on\nwhich he could borrow, except his house in Nankeen Square, or the mine\nand works at Lapham.  He set his teeth in helpless rage when he thought\nof that property out on the G. L. & P., that ought to be worth so much,\nand was worth so little if the Road chose to say so.\n\nHe did not go home, but spent most of the day shining round, as he\nwould have expressed it, and trying to see if he could raise the money.\nBut he found that people of whom he hoped to get it were in the\nconspiracy which had been formed to drive him to the wall.  Somehow,\nthere seemed a sense of his embarrassments abroad.  Nobody wanted to\nlend money on the plant at Lapham without taking time to look into the\nstate of the business; but Lapham had no time to give, and he knew that\nthe state of the business would not bear looking into.  He could raise\nfifteen thousand on his Nankeen Square house, and another fifteen on\nhis Beacon Street lot, and this was all that a man who was worth a\nmillion by rights could do! He said a million, and he said it in\ndefiance of Bellingham, who had subjected his figures to an analysis\nwhich wounded Lapham more than he chose to show at the time, for it\nproved that he was not so rich and not so wise as he had seemed.  His\nhurt vanity forbade him to go to Bellingham now for help or advice; and\nif he could have brought himself to ask his brothers for money, it\nwould have been useless; they were simply well-to-do Western people,\nbut not capitalists on the scale he required.\n\nLapham stood in the isolation to which adversity so often seems to\nbring men.  When its test was applied, practically or theoretically, to\nall those who had seemed his friends, there was none who bore it; and\nhe thought with bitter self-contempt of the people whom he had\nbefriended in their time of need.  He said to himself that he had been\na fool for that; and he scorned himself for certain acts of\nscrupulosity by which he had lost money in the past.  Seeing the moral\nforces all arrayed against him, Lapham said that he would like to have\nthe chance offered him to get even with them again; he thought he\nshould know how to look out for himself.  As he understood it, he had\nseveral days to turn about in, and he did not let one day's failure\ndishearten him.  The morning after his return he had, in fact, a gleam\nof luck that gave him the greatest encouragement for the moment.  A man\ncame in to inquire about one of Rogers's wild-cat patents, as Lapham\ncalled them, and ended by buying it.  He got it, of course, for less\nthan Lapham took it for, but Lapham was glad to be rid of it for\nsomething, when he had thought it worth nothing; and when the\ntransaction was closed, he asked the purchaser rather eagerly if he\nknew where Rogers was; it was Lapham's secret belief that Rogers had\nfound there was money in the thing, and had sent the man to buy it.\nBut it appeared that this was a mistake; the man had not come from\nRogers, but had heard of the patent in another way; and Lapham was\nastonished in the afternoon, when his boy came to tell him that Rogers\nwas in the outer office, and wished to speak with him.\n\n\"All right,\" said Lapham, and he could not command at once the severity\nfor the reception of Rogers which he would have liked to use.  He found\nhimself, in fact, so much relaxed towards him by the morning's touch of\nprosperity that he asked him to sit down, gruffly, of course, but\ndistinctly; and when Rogers said in his lifeless way, and with the\neffect of keeping his appointment of a month before, \"Those English\nparties are in town, and would like to talk with you in reference to\nthe mills,\" Lapham did not turn him out-of-doors.\n\nHe sat looking at him, and trying to make out what Rogers was after;\nfor he did not believe that the English parties, if they existed, had\nany notion of buying his mills.\n\n\"What if they are not for sale?\" he asked.  \"You know that I've been\nexpecting an offer from the G. L. & P.\"\n\n\"I've kept watch of that.  They haven't made you any offer,\" said\nRogers quietly.\n\n\"And did you think,\" demanded Lapham, firing up, \"that I would turn\nthem in on somebody else as you turned them in on me, when the chances\nare that they won't be worth ten cents on the dollar six months from\nnow?\"\n\n\"I didn't know what you would do,\" said Rogers non-committally.  \"I've\ncome here to tell you that these parties stand ready to take the mills\noff your hands at a fair valuation--at the value I put upon them when I\nturned them in.\"\n\n\"I don't believe you!\" cried Lapham brutally, but a wild predatory hope\nmade his heart leap so that it seemed to turn over in his breast.  \"I\ndon't believe there are any such parties to begin with; and in the next\nplace, I don't believe they would buy at any such figure;\nunless--unless you've lied to them, as you've lied to me.  Did you tell\nthem about the G. L. & P.?\"\n\nRogers looked compassionately at him, but he answered, with unvaried\ndryness, \"I did not think that necessary.\"\n\nLapham had expected this answer, and he had expected or intended to\nbreak out in furious denunciation of Rogers when he got it; but he only\nfound himself saying, in a sort of baffled gasp, \"I wonder what your\ngame is!\"\n\nRogers did not reply categorically, but he answered, with his impartial\ncalm, and as if Lapham had said nothing to indicate that he differed at\nall with him as to disposing of the property in the way he had\nsuggested: \"If we should succeed in selling, I should be able to repay\nyou your loans, and should have a little capital for a scheme that I\nthink of going into.\"\n\n\"And do you think that I am going to steal these men's money to help\nyou plunder somebody in a new scheme?\" answered Lapham.  The sneer was\non behalf of virtue, but it was still a sneer.\n\n\"I suppose the money would be useful to you too, just now.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because I know that you have been trying to borrow.\"\n\nAt this proof of wicked omniscience in Rogers, the question whether he\nhad better not regard the affair as a fatality, and yield to his\ndestiny, flashed upon Lapham; but he answered, \"I shall want money a\ngreat deal worse than I've ever wanted it yet, before I go into such\nrascally business with you.  Don't you know that we might as well knock\nthese parties down on the street, and take the money out of their\npockets?\"\n\n\"They have come on,\" answered Rogers, \"from Portland to see you.  I\nexpected them some weeks ago, but they disappointed me.  They arrived\non the Circassian last night; they expected to have got in five days\nago, but the passage was very stormy.\"\n\n\"Where are they?\" asked Lapham, with helpless irrelevance, and feeling\nhimself somehow drifted from his moorings by Rogers's shipping\nintelligence.\n\n\"They are at Young's. I told them we would call upon them after dinner\nthis evening; they dine late.\"\n\n\"Oh, you did, did you?\" asked Lapham, trying to drop another anchor for\na fresh clutch on his underlying principles.  \"Well, now, you go and\ntell them that I said I wouldn't come.\"\n\n\"Their stay is limited,\" remarked Rogers.  \"I mentioned this evening\nbecause they were not certain they could remain over another night.\nBut if to-morrow would suit you better----\"\n\n\"Tell 'em I shan't come at all,\" roared Lapham, as much in terror as\ndefiance, for he felt his anchor dragging.  \"Tell 'em I shan't come at\nall! Do you understand that?\"\n\n\"I don't see why you should stickle as to the matter of going to them,\"\nsaid Rogers; \"but if you think it will be better to have them approach\nyou, I suppose I can bring them to you.\"\n\n\"No, you can't! I shan't let you! I shan't see them! I shan't have\nanything to do with them.  NOW do you understand?\"\n\n\"I inferred from our last interview,\" persisted Rogers, unmoved by all\nthis violent demonstration of Lapham's, \"that you wished to meet these\nparties.  You told me that you would give me time to produce them; and\nI have promised them that you would meet them; I have committed myself.\"\n\nIt was true that Lapham had defied Rogers to bring on his men, and had\nimplied his willingness to negotiate with them.  That was before he had\ntalked the matter over with his wife, and perceived his moral\nresponsibility in it; even she had not seen this at once.  He could not\nenter into this explanation with Rogers; he could only say, \"I said I'd\ngive you twenty-four hours to prove yourself a liar, and you did it.  I\ndidn't say twenty-four days.\"\n\n\"I don't see the difference,\" returned Rogers.  \"The parties are here\nnow, and that proves that I was acting in good faith at the time.\nThere has been no change in the posture of affairs.  You don't know now\nany more than you knew then that the G. L. & P. is going to want the\nproperty.  If there's any difference, it's in favour of the Road's\nhaving changed its mind.\"\n\nThere was some sense in this, and Lapham felt it--felt it only too\neagerly, as he recognised the next instant.\n\nRogers went on quietly: \"You're not obliged to sell to these parties\nwhen you meet them; but you've allowed me to commit myself to them by\nthe promise that you would talk with them.\"\n\n\"'Twan't a promise,\" said Lapham.\n\n\"It was the same thing; they have come out from England on my guaranty\nthat there was such and such an opening for their capital; and now what\nam I to say to them?  It places me in a ridiculous position.\" Rogers\nurged his grievance calmly, almost impersonally, making his appeal to\nLapham's sense of justice.  \"I CAN'T go back to those parties and tell\nthem you won't see them.  It's no answer to make.  They've got a right\nto know why you won't see them.\"\n\n\"Very well, then!\" cried Lapham; \"I'll come and TELL them why.  Who\nshall I ask for? When shall I be there?\"\n\n\"At eight o'clock, please,\" said Rogers, rising, without apparent alarm\nat his threat, if it was a threat.  \"And ask for me; I've taken a room\nat the hotel for the present.\"\n\n\"I won't keep you five minutes when I get there,\" said Lapham; but he\ndid not come away till ten o'clock.\n\nIt appeared to him as if the very devil was in it.  The Englishmen\ntreated his downright refusal to sell as a piece of bluff, and talked\non as though it were merely the opening of the negotiation.  When he\nbecame plain with them in his anger, and told them why he would not\nsell, they seemed to have been prepared for this as a stroke of\nbusiness, and were ready to meet it.\n\n\"Has this fellow,\" he demanded, twisting his head in the direction of\nRogers, but disdaining to notice him otherwise, \"been telling you that\nit's part of my game to say this? Well, sir, I can tell you, on my\nside, that there isn't a slipperier rascal unhung in America than\nMilton K. Rogers!\"\n\nThe Englishmen treated this as a piece of genuine American humour, and\nreturned to the charge with unabated courage.  They owned now, that a\nperson interested with them had been out to look at the property, and\nthat they were satisfied with the appearance of things.  They developed\nfurther the fact that they were not acting solely, or even principally,\nin their own behalf, but were the agents of people in England who had\nprojected the colonisation of a sort of community on the spot, somewhat\nafter the plan of other English dreamers, and that they were satisfied,\nfrom a careful inspection, that the resources and facilities were those\nbest calculated to develop the energy and enterprise of the proposed\ncommunity.  They were prepared to meet Mr. Lapham--Colonel, they begged\nhis pardon, at the instance of Rogers--at any reasonable figure, and\nwere quite willing to assume the risks he had pointed out.  Something\nin the eyes of these men, something that lurked at an infinite depth\nbelow their speech, and was not really in their eyes when Lapham looked\nagain, had flashed through him a sense of treachery in them.  He had\nthought them the dupes of Rogers; but in that brief instant he had seen\nthem--or thought he had seen them--his accomplices, ready to betray the\ninterests of which they went on to speak with a certain comfortable\njocosity, and a certain incredulous slight of his show of integrity.\nIt was a deeper game than Lapham was used to, and he sat looking with a\nsort of admiration from one Englishman to the other, and then to\nRogers, who maintained an exterior of modest neutrality, and whose air\nsaid, \"I have brought you gentlemen together as the friend of all\nparties, and I now leave you to settle it among yourselves.  I ask\nnothing, and expect nothing, except the small sum which shall accrue to\nme after the discharge of my obligations to Colonel Lapham.\"\n\nWhile Rogers's presence expressed this, one of the Englishmen was\nsaying, \"And if you have any scruple in allowin' us to assume this\nrisk, Colonel Lapham, perhaps you can console yourself with the fact\nthat the loss, if there is to be any, will fall upon people who are\nable to bear it--upon an association of rich and charitable people.\nBut we're quite satisfied there will be no loss,\" he added savingly.\n\"All you have to do is to name your price, and we will do our best to\nmeet it.\"\n\nThere was nothing in the Englishman's sophistry very shocking to\nLapham.  It addressed itself in him to that easy-going, not evilly\nintentioned, potential immorality which regards common property as\ncommon prey, and gives us the most corrupt municipal governments under\nthe sun--which makes the poorest voter, when he has tricked into place,\nas unscrupulous in regard to others' money as an hereditary prince.\nLapham met the Englishman's eye, and with difficulty kept himself from\nwinking.  Then he looked away, and tried to find out where he stood, or\nwhat he wanted to do.  He could hardly tell.  He had expected to come\ninto that room and unmask Rogers, and have it over.  But he had\nunmasked Rogers without any effect whatever, and the play had only\nbegun.  He had a whimsical and sarcastic sense of its being very\ndifferent from the plays at the theatre.  He could not get up and go\naway in silent contempt; he could not tell the Englishmen that he\nbelieved them a pair of scoundrels and should have nothing to do with\nthem; he could no longer treat them as innocent dupes.  He remained\nbaffled and perplexed, and the one who had not spoken hitherto\nremarked--\n\n\"Of course we shan't 'aggle about a few pound, more or less.  If\nColonel Lapham's figure should be a little larger than ours, I've no\ndoubt 'e'll not be too 'ard upon us in the end.\"\n\nLapham appreciated all the intent of this subtle suggestion, and\nunderstood as plainly as if it had been said in so many words, that if\nthey paid him a larger price, it was to be expected that a certain\nportion of the purchase-money was to return to their own hands.  Still\nhe could not move; and it seemed to him that he could not speak.\n\n\"Ring that bell, Mr. Rogers,\" said the Englishman who had last spoken,\nglancing at the annunciator button in the wall near Rogers's head, \"and\n'ave up something 'of, can't you? I should like TO wet me w'istle, as\nyou say 'ere, and Colonel Lapham seems to find it rather dry work.\"\n\nLapham jumped to his feet, and buttoned his overcoat about him.  He\nremembered with terror the dinner at Corey's where he had disgraced and\nbetrayed himself, and if he went into this thing at all, he was going\ninto it sober.  \"I can't stop,\" he said, \"I must be going.\"\n\n\"But you haven't given us an answer yet, Mr. Lapham,\" said the first\nEnglishman with a successful show of dignified surprise.\n\n\"The only answer I can give you now is, NO,\" said Lapham.  \"If you want\nanother, you must let me have time to think it over.\"\n\n\"But 'ow much time?\" said the other Englishman.  \"We're pressed for\ntime ourselves, and we hoped for an answer--'oped for a hanswer,\" he\ncorrected himself, \"at once.  That was our understandin' with Mr.\nRogers.\"\n\n\"I can't let you know till morning, anyway,\" said Lapham, and he went\nout, as his custom often was, without any parting salutation.  He\nthought Rogers might try to detain him; but Rogers had remained seated\nwhen the others got to their feet, and paid no attention to his\ndeparture.\n\nHe walked out into the night air, every pulse throbbing with the strong\ntemptation.  He knew very well those men would wait, and gladly wait,\ntill the morning, and that the whole affair was in his hands.  It made\nhim groan in spirit to think that it was.  If he had hoped that some\nchance might take the decision from him, there was no such chance, in\nthe present or future, that he could see.  It was for him alone to\ncommit this rascality--if it was a rascality--or not.\n\nHe walked all the way home, letting one car after another pass him on\nthe street, now so empty of other passing, and it was almost eleven\no'clock when he reached home.  A carriage stood before his house, and\nwhen he let himself in with his key, he heard talking in the\nfamily-room. It came into his head that Irene had got back\nunexpectedly, and that the sight of her was somehow going to make it\nharder for him; then he thought it might be Corey, come upon some\ndesperate pretext to see Penelope; but when he opened the door he saw,\nwith a certain absence of surprise, that it was Rogers.  He was\nstanding with his back to the fireplace, talking to Mrs. Lapham, and he\nhad been shedding tears; dry tears they seemed, and they had left a\nsort of sandy, glistening trace on his cheeks.  Apparently he was not\nashamed of them, for the expression with which he met Lapham was that\nof a man making a desperate appeal in his own cause, which was\nidentical with that of humanity, if not that of justice.\n\n\"I some expected,\" began Rogers, \"to find you here----\"\n\n\"No, you didn't,\" interrupted Lapham; \"you wanted to come here and make\na poor mouth to Mrs. Lapham before I got home.\"\n\n\"I knew that Mrs. Lapham would know what was going on,\" said Rogers\nmore candidly, but not more virtuously, for that he could not, \"and I\nwished her to understand a point that I hadn't put to you at the hotel,\nand that I want you should consider.  And I want you should consider me\na little in this business too; you're not the only one that's\nconcerned, I tell you, and I've been telling Mrs. Lapham that it's my\none chance; that if you don't meet me on it, my wife and children will\nbe reduced to beggary.\"\n\n\"So will mine,\" said Lapham, \"or the next thing to it.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I want you to give me this chance to get on my feet again.\nYou've no right to deprive me of it; it's unchristian.  In our dealings\nwith each other we should be guided by the Golden Rule, as I was saying\nto Mrs. Lapham before you came in.  I told her that if I knew myself, I\nshould in your place consider the circumstances of a man in mine, who\nhad honourably endeavoured to discharge his obligations to me, and had\npatiently borne my undeserved suspicions.  I should consider that man's\nfamily, I told Mrs. Lapham.\"\n\n\"Did you tell her that if I went in with you and those fellows, I\nshould be robbing the people who trusted them?\"\n\n\"I don't see what you've got to do with the people that sent them here.\nThey are rich people, and could bear it if it came to the worst.  But\nthere's no likelihood, now, that it will come to the worst; you can see\nyourself that the Road has changed its mind about buying.  And here am\nI without a cent in the world; and my wife is an invalid.  She needs\ncomforts, she needs little luxuries, and she hasn't even the\nnecessaries; and you want to sacrifice her to a mere idea! You don't\nknow in the first place that the Road will ever want to buy; and if it\ndoes, the probability is that with a colony like that planted on its\nline, it would make very different terms from what it would with you or\nme.  These agents are not afraid, and their principals are rich people;\nand if there was any loss, it would be divided up amongst them so that\nthey wouldn't any of them feel it.\"\n\nLapham stole a troubled glance at his wife, and saw that there was no\nhelp in her.  Whether she was daunted and confused in her own\nconscience by the outcome, so evil and disastrous, of the reparation to\nRogers which she had forced her husband to make, or whether her\nperceptions had been blunted and darkened by the appeals which Rogers\nhad now used, it would be difficult to say.  Probably there was a\nmixture of both causes in the effect which her husband felt in her, and\nfrom which he turned, girding himself anew, to Rogers.\n\n\"I have no wish to recur to the past,\" continued Rogers, with growing\nsuperiority.  \"You have shown a proper spirit in regard to that, and\nyou have done what you could to wipe it out.\"\n\n\"I should think I had,\" said Lapham.  \"I've used up about a hundred and\nfifty thousand dollars trying.\"\n\n\"Some of my enterprises,\" Rogers admitted, \"have been unfortunate,\nseemingly; but I have hopes that they will yet turn out well--in time.\nI can't understand why you should be so mindful of others now, when you\nshowed so little regard for me then.  I had come to your aid at a time\nwhen you needed help, and when you got on your feet you kicked me out\nof the business.  I don't complain, but that is the fact; and I had to\nbegin again, after I had supposed myself settled in life, and establish\nmyself elsewhere.\"\n\nLapham glanced again at his wife; her head had fallen; he could see\nthat she was so rooted in her old remorse for that questionable act of\nhis, amply and more than fully atoned for since, that she was helpless,\nnow in the crucial moment, when he had the utmost need of her insight.\nHe had counted upon her; he perceived now that when he had thought it\nwas for him alone to decide, he had counted upon her just spirit to\nstay his own in its struggle to be just.  He had not forgotten how she\nheld out against him only a little while ago, when he asked her whether\nhe might not rightfully sell in some such contingency as this; and it\nwas not now that she said or even looked anything in favour of Rogers,\nbut that she was silent against him, which dismayed Lapham.  He\nswallowed the lump that rose in his throat, the self-pity, the pity for\nher, the despair, and said gently, \"I guess you better go to bed,\nPersis.  It's pretty late.\"\n\nShe turned towards the door, when Rogers said, with the obvious\nintention of detaining her through her curiosity--\n\n\"But I let that pass.  And I don't ask now that you should sell to\nthese men.\"\n\nMrs. Lapham paused, irresolute.\n\n\"What are you making this bother for, then?\" demanded Lapham.  \"What DO\nyou want?\"\n\n\"What I've been telling your wife here.  I want you should sell to me.\nI don't say what I'm going to do with the property, and you will not\nhave an iota of responsibility, whatever happens.\"\n\nLapham was staggered, and he saw his wife's face light up with eager\nquestion.\n\n\"I want that property,\" continued Rogers, \"and I've got the money to\nbuy it.  What will you take for it? If it's the price you're standing\nout for----\"\n\n\"Persis,\" said Lapham, \"go to bed,\" and he gave her a look that meant\nobedience for her.  She went out of the door, and left him with his\ntempter.\n\n\"If you think I'm going to help you whip the devil round the stump,\nyou're mistaken in your man, Milton Rogers,\" said Lapham, lighting a\ncigar.  \"As soon as I sold to you, you would sell to that other pair of\nrascals.  I smelt 'em out in half a minute.\"\n\n\"They are Christian gentlemen,\" said Rogers.  \"But I don't purpose\ndefending them; and I don't purpose telling you what I shall or shall\nnot do with the property when it is in my hands again.  The question\nis, Will you sell, and, if so, what is your figure? You have got\nnothing whatever to do with it after you've sold.\"\n\nIt was perfectly true.  Any lawyer would have told him the same.  He\ncould not help admiring Rogers for his ingenuity, and every selfish\ninterest of his nature joined with many obvious duties to urge him to\nconsent.  He did not see why he should refuse.  There was no longer a\nreason.  He was standing out alone for nothing, any one else would say.\nHe smoked on as if Rogers were not there, and Rogers remained before\nthe fire as patient as the clock ticking behind his head on the mantel,\nand showing the gleam of its pendulum beyond his face on either side.\nBut at last he said, \"Well?\"\n\n\"Well,\" answered Lapham, \"you can't expect me to give you an answer\nto-night, any more than before.  You know that what you've said now\nhasn't changed the thing a bit.  I wish it had.  The Lord knows, I want\nto be rid of the property fast enough.\" \"Then why don't you sell to me?\nCan't you see that you will not be responsible for what happens after\nyou have sold?\"\n\n\"No, I can't see that; but if I can by morning, I'll sell.\"\n\n\"Why do you expect to know any better by morning?  You're wasting time\nfor nothing!\" cried Rogers, in his disappointment.  \"Why are you so\nparticular? When you drove me out of the business you were not so very\nparticular.\"\n\nLapham winced.  It was certainly ridiculous for man who had once so\nselfishly consulted his own interests to be stickling now about the\nrights of others.\n\n\"I guess nothing's going to happen overnight,\" he answered sullenly.\n\"Anyway, I shan't say what I shall do till morning.\"\n\n\"What time can I see you in the morning?\"\n\n\"Half-past nine.\"\n\nRogers buttoned his coat, and went out of the room without another\nword.  Lapham followed him to close the street-door after him.\n\nHis wife called down to him from above as he approached the room again,\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I've told him I'd let him know in the morning.\"\n\n\"Want I should come down and talk with you?\"\n\n\"No,\" answered Lapham, in the proud bitterness which his isolation\nbrought, \"you couldn't do any good.\" He went in and shut the door, and\nby and by his wife heard him begin walking up and down; and then the\nrest of the night she lay awake and listened to him walking up and\ndown.  But when the first light whitened the window, the words of the\nScripture came into her mind: \"And there wrestled a man with him until\nthe breaking of the day.... And he said, Let me go, for the day\nbreaketh.  And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.\"\n\nShe could not ask him anything when they met, but he raised his dull\neyes after the first silence, and said, \"I don't know what I'm going to\nsay to Rogers.\"\n\nShe could not speak; she did not know what to say, and she saw her\nhusband when she followed him with her eyes from the window, drag\nheavily down toward the corner, where he was to take, the horse-car.\n\nHe arrived rather later than usual at his office, and he found his\nletters already on his table.  There was one, long and\nofficial-looking, with a printed letter-heading on the outside, and\nLapham had no need to open it in order to know that it was the offer of\nthe Great Lacustrine & Polar Railroad for his mills.  But he went\nmechanically through the verification of his prophetic fear, which was\nalso his sole hope, and then sat looking blankly at it.\n\nRogers came promptly at the appointed time, and Lapham handed him the\nletter.  He must have taken it all in at a glance, and seen the\nimpossibility of negotiating any further now, even with victims so\npliant and willing as those Englishmen.\n\n\"You've ruined me!\" Rogers broke out.  \"I haven't a cent left in the\nworld! God help my poor wife!\"\n\nHe went out, and Lapham remained staring at the door which closed upon\nhim.  This was his reward for standing firm for right and justice to\nhis own destruction: to feel like a thief and a murderer.\n\n\n\nXXVI.\n\n\nLATER in the forenoon came the despatch from the West Virginians in New\nYork, saying their brother assented to their agreement; and it now\nremained for Lapham to fulfil his part of it.  He was ludicrously far\nfrom able to do this; and unless he could get some extension of time\nfrom them, he must lose this chance, his only chance, to retrieve\nhimself.  He spent the time in a desperate endeavour to raise the\nmoney, but he had not raised the half of it when the banks closed.\nWith shame in his heart he went to Bellingham, from whom he had parted\nso haughtily, and laid his plan before him.  He could not bring himself\nto ask Bellingham's help, but he told him what he proposed to do.\nBellingham pointed out that the whole thing was an experiment, and that\nthe price asked was enormous, unless a great success were morally\ncertain.  He advised delay, he advised prudence; he insisted that\nLapham ought at least to go out to Kanawha Falls, and see the mines and\nworks before he put any such sum into the development of the enterprise.\n\n\"That's all well enough,\" cried Lapham; \"but if I don't clinch this\noffer within twenty-four hours, they'll withdraw it, and go into the\nmarket; and then where am I?\"\n\n\"Go on and see them again,\" said Bellingham.  \"They can't be so\nperemptory as that with you.  They must give you time to look at what\nthey want to sell.  If it turns out what you hope, then--I'll see what\ncan be done.  But look into it thoroughly.\"\n\n\"Well!\" cried Lapham, helplessly submitting.  He took out his watch,\nand saw that he had forty minutes to catch the four o'clock train.  He\nhurried back to his office, and put together some papers preparatory to\ngoing, and despatched a note by his boy to Mrs. Lapham saying that he\nwas starting for New York, and did not know just when he should get\nback.\n\nThe early spring day was raw and cold.  As he went out through the\noffice he saw the clerks at work with their street-coats and hats on;\nMiss Dewey had her jacket dragged up on her shoulders, and looked\nparticularly comfortless as she operated her machine with her red\nfingers.  \"What's up?\" asked Lapham, stopping a moment.\n\n\"Seems to be something the matter with the steam,\" she answered, with\nthe air of unmerited wrong habitual with so many pretty women who have\nto work for a living.\n\n\"Well, take your writer into my room.  There's a fire in the stove\nthere,\" said Lapham, passing out.\n\nHalf an hour later his wife came into the outer office.  She had passed\nthe day in a passion of self-reproach, gradually mounting from the\nmental numbness in which he had left her, and now she could wait no\nlonger to tell him that she saw how she had forsaken him in his hour of\ntrial and left him to bear it alone.  She wondered at herself in shame\nand dismay; she wondered that she could have been so confused as to the\nreal point by that old wretch of a Rogers, that she could have let him\nhoodwink her so, even for a moment.  It astounded her that such a thing\nshould have happened, for if there was any virtue upon which this good\nwoman prided herself, in which she thought herself superior to her\nhusband, it was her instant and steadfast perception of right and\nwrong, and the ability to choose the right to her own hurt.  But she\nhad now to confess, as each of us has had likewise to confess in his\nown case, that the very virtue on which she had prided herself was the\nthing that had played her false; that she had kept her mind so long\nupon that old wrong which she believed her husband had done this man\nthat she could not detach it, but clung to the thought of reparation\nfor it when she ought to have seen that he was proposing a piece of\nroguery as the means.  The suffering which Lapham must inflict on him\nif he decided against him had been more to her apprehension than the\nharm he might do if he decided for him.  But now she owned her\nlimitations to herself, and above everything in the world she wished\nthe man whom her conscience had roused and driven on whither her\nintelligence had not followed, to do right, to do what he felt to be\nright, and nothing else.  She admired and revered him for going beyond\nher, and she wished to tell him that she did not know what he had\ndetermined to do about Rogers, but that she knew it was right, and\nwould gladly abide the consequences with him, whatever they were.\n\nShe had not been near his place of business for nearly a year, and her\nheart smote her tenderly as she looked about her there, and thought of\nthe early days when she knew as much about the paint as he did; she\nwished that those days were back again.  She saw Corey at his desk, and\nshe could not bear to speak to him; she dropped her veil that she need\nnot recognise him, and pushed on to Lapham's room, and opening the door\nwithout knocking, shut it behind her.\n\nThen she became aware with intolerable disappointment that her husband\nwas not there.  Instead, a very pretty girl sat at his desk, operating\na typewriter.  She seemed quite at home, and she paid Mrs. Lapham the\nscant attention which such young women often bestow upon people not\npersonally interesting to them.  It vexed the wife that any one else\nshould seem to be helping her husband about business that she had once\nbeen so intimate with; and she did not at all like the girl's\nindifference to her presence.  Her hat and sack hung on a nail in one\ncorner, and Lapham's office coat, looking intensely like him to his\nwife's familiar eye, hung on a nail in the other corner; and Mrs.\nLapham liked even less than the girl's good looks this domestication of\nher garments in her husband's office.  She began to ask herself\nexcitedly why he should be away from his office when she happened to\ncome; and she had not the strength at the moment to reason herself out\nof her unreasonableness.\n\n\"When will Colonel Lapham be in, do you suppose?\" she sharply asked of\nthe girl.\n\n\"I couldn't say exactly,\" replied the girl, without looking round.\n\n\"Has he been out long?\"\n\n\"I don't know as I noticed,\" said the girl, looking up at the clock,\nwithout looking at Mrs. Lapham.  She went on working her machine.\n\n\"Well, I can't wait any longer,\" said the wife abruptly.  \"When Colonel\nLapham comes in, you please tell him Mrs. Lapham wants to see him.\"\n\nThe girl started to her feet and turned toward Mrs. Lapham with a red\nand startled face, which she did not lift to confront her.\n\"Yes--yes--I will,\" she faltered.\n\nThe wife went home with a sense of defeat mixed with an irritation\nabout this girl which she could not quell or account for.  She found\nher husband's message, and it seemed intolerable that he should have\ngone to New York without seeing her; she asked herself in vain what the\nmysterious business could be that took him away so suddenly.  She said\nto herself that he was neglecting her; he was leaving her out a little\ntoo much; and in demanding of herself why he had never mentioned that\ngirl there in his office, she forgot how much she had left herself out\nof his business life.  That was another curse of their prosperity.\nWell, she was glad the prosperity was going; it had never been\nhappiness.  After this she was going to know everything as she used.\n\nShe tried to dismiss the whole matter till Lapham returned; and if\nthere had been anything for her to do in that miserable house, as she\ncalled it in her thought, she might have succeeded.  But again the\ncurse was on her; there was nothing to do; and the looks of that girl\nkept coming back to her vacancy, her disoccupation.  She tried to make\nherself something to do, but that beauty, which she had not liked,\nfollowed her amid the work of overhauling the summer clothing, which\nIrene had seen to putting away in the fall.  Who was the thing, anyway?\nIt was very strange, her being there; why did she jump up in that\nfrightened way when Mrs. Lapham had named herself?\n\nAfter dark, that evening, when the question had worn away its poignancy\nfrom mere iteration, a note for Mrs. Lapham was left at the door by a\nmessenger who said there was no answer.  \"A note for me?\" she said,\nstaring at the unknown, and somehow artificial-looking, handwriting of\nthe superscription.  Then she opened it and read: \"Ask your husband\nabout his lady copying-clerk.  A Friend and Well-wisher,\" who signed\nthe note, gave no other name.\n\nMrs. Lapham sat helpless with it in her hand.  Her brain reeled; she\ntried to fight the madness off; but before Lapham came back the second\nmorning, it had become, with lessening intervals of sanity and release,\na demoniacal possession.  She passed the night without sleep, without\nrest, in the frenzy of the cruellest of the passions, which covers with\nshame the unhappy soul it possesses, and murderously lusts for the\nmisery of its object.  If she had known where to find her husband in\nNew York, she would have followed him; she waited his return in an\necstasy of impatience.  In the morning he came back, looking spent and\nhaggard.  She saw him drive up to the door, and she ran to let him in\nherself.\n\n\"Who is that girl you've got in your office, Silas Lapham?\" she\ndemanded, when her husband entered.\n\n\"Girl in my office?\"\n\n\"Yes! Who is she? What is she doing there?\"\n\n\"Why, what have you heard about her?\"\n\n\"Never you mind what I've heard.  Who is she? IS IT MRS. M. THAT YOU\nGAVE THAT MONEY TO? I want to know who she is! I want to know what a\nrespectable man, with grown-up girls of his own, is doing with such a\nlooking thing as that in his office? I want to know how long she's been\nthere? I want to know what she's there at all for?\"\n\nHe had mechanically pushed her before him into the long, darkened\nparlour, and he shut himself in there with her now, to keep the\nhousehold from hearing her lifted voice.  For a while he stood\nbewildered, and could not have answered if he would, and then he would\nnot.  He merely asked, \"Have I ever accused you of anything wrong,\nPersis?\"\n\n\"You no need to!\" she answered furiously, placing herself against the\nclosed door.\n\n\"Did you ever know me to do anything out of the way?\"\n\n\"That isn't what I asked you.\"\n\n\"Well, I guess you may find out about that girl yourself.  Get away\nfrom the door.\"\n\n\"I won't get away from the door.\"\n\nShe felt herself set lightly aside, and her husband opened the door and\nwent out.  \"I WILL find out about her,\" she screamed after him.  \"I'll\nfind out, and I'll disgrace you.  I'll teach you how to treat me----\"\n\nThe air blackened round her: she reeled to the sofa and then she found\nherself waking from a faint.  She did not know how long she had lain\nthere, she did not care.  In a moment her madness came whirling back\nupon her.  She rushed up to his room; it was empty; the closet-doors\nstood ajar and the drawers were open; he must have packed a bag hastily\nand fled.  She went out and wandered crazily up and down till she found\na hack.  She gave the driver her husband's business address, and told\nhim to drive there as fast as he could; and three times she lowered the\nwindow to put her head out and ask him if he could not hurry.  A\nthousand things thronged into her mind to support her in her evil will.\nShe remembered how glad and proud that man had been to marry her, and\nhow everybody said she was marrying beneath her when she took him.  She\nremembered how good she had always been to him, how perfectly devoted,\nslaving early and late to advance him, and looking out for his\ninterests in all things, and sparing herself in nothing.  If it had not\nbeen for her, he might have been driving stage yet; and since their\ntroubles had begun, the troubles which his own folly and imprudence had\nbrought on them, her conduct had been that of a true and faithful wife.\nWas HE the sort of man to be allowed to play her false with impunity?\nShe set her teeth and drew her breath sharply through them when she\nthought how willingly she had let him befool her, and delude her about\nthat memorandum of payments to Mrs. M., because she loved him so much,\nand pitied him for his cares and anxieties.  She recalled his\nconfusion, his guilty looks.\n\nShe plunged out of the carriage so hastily when she reached the office\nthat she did not think of paying the driver; and he had to call after\nher when she had got half-way up the stairs.  Then she went straight to\nLapham's room, with outrage in her heart.  There was again no one there\nbut that type-writer girl; she jumped to her feet in a fright, as Mrs.\nLapham dashed the door to behind her and flung up her veil.\n\nThe two women confronted each other.\n\n\"Why, the good land!\" cried Mrs. Lapham, \"ain't you Zerrilla Millon?\"\n\n\"I--I'm married,\" faltered the girl \"My name's Dewey, now.\"\n\n\"You're Jim Millon's daughter, anyway.  How long have you been here?\"\n\n\"I haven't been here regularly; I've been here off and on ever since\nlast May.\"\n\n\"Where's your mother?\"\n\n\"She's here--in Boston.\"\n\nMrs. Lapham kept her eyes on the girl, but she dropped, trembling, into\nher husband's chair, and a sort of amaze and curiosity were in her\nvoice instead of the fury she had meant to put there.\n\n\"The Colonel,\" continued Zerrilla, \"he's been helping us, and he's got\nme a type-writer, so that I can help myself a little.  Mother's doing\npretty well now; and when Hen isn't around we can get along.\"\n\n\"That your husband?\"\n\n\"I never wanted to marry him; but he promised to try to get something\nto do on shore; and mother was all for it, because he had a little\nproperty then, and I thought may be I'd better.  But it's turned out\njust as I said and if he don't stay away long enough this time to let\nme get the divorce,--he's agreed to it, time and again,--I don't know\nwhat we're going to do.\" Zerrilla's voice fell, and the trouble which\nshe could keep out of her face usually, when she was comfortably warmed\nand fed and prettily dressed, clouded it in the presence of a\nsympathetic listener.  \"I saw it was you, when you came in the other\nday,\" she went on; \"but you didn't seem to know me.  I suppose the\nColonel's told you that there's a gentleman going to marry me--Mr.\nWemmel's his name--as soon as I get the divorce; but sometimes I'm\ncompletely discouraged; it don't seem as if I ever could get it.\"\n\nMrs. Lapham would not let her know that she was ignorant of the fact\nattributed to her knowledge.  She remained listening to Zerrilla, and\npiecing out the whole history of her presence there from the facts of\nthe past, and the traits of her husband's character.  One of the things\nshe had always had to fight him about was that idea of his that he was\nbound to take care of Jim Millon's worthless wife and her child because\nMillon had got the bullet that was meant for him.  It was a perfect\nsuperstition of his; she could not beat it out of him; but she had made\nhim promise the last time he had done anything for that woman that it\nshould BE the last time.  He had then got her a little house in one of\nthe fishing ports, where she could take the sailors to board and wash\nfor, and earn an honest living if she would keep straight.  That was\nfive or six years ago, and Mrs. Lapham had heard nothing of Mrs. Millon\nsince; she had heard quite enough of her before; and had known her idle\nand baddish ever since she was the worst little girl at school in\nLumberville, and all through her shameful girlhood, and the married\ndays which she had made so miserable to the poor fellow who had given\nher his decent name and a chance to behave herself.  Mrs. Lapham had no\nmercy on Moll Millon, and she had quarrelled often enough with her\nhusband for befriending her.  As for the child, if the mother would put\nZerrilla out with some respectable family, that would be ONE thing; but\nas long as she kept Zerrilla with her, she was against letting her\nhusband do anything for either of them.  He had done ten times as much\nfor them now as he had any need to, and she had made him give her his\nsolemn word that he would do no more.  She saw now that she was wrong\nto make him give it, and that he must have broken it again and again\nfor the reason that he had given when she once scolded him for throwing\naway his money on that hussy--\n\n\"When I think of Jim Millon, I've got to; that's all.\"\n\nShe recalled now that whenever she had brought up the subject of Mrs.\nMillon and her daughter, he had seemed shy of it, and had dropped it\nwith some guess that they were getting along now.  She wondered that\nshe had not thought at once of Mrs. Millon when she saw that memorandum\nabout Mrs. M.; but the woman had passed so entirely out of her life,\nthat she had never dreamt of her in connection with it.  Her husband\nhad deceived her, yet her heart was no longer hot against him, but\nrather tenderly grateful that his deceit was in this sort, and not in\nthat other.  All cruel and shameful doubt of him went out of it.  She\nlooked at this beautiful girl, who had blossomed out of her knowledge\nsince she saw her last, and she knew that she was only a blossomed\nweed, of the same worthless root as her mother, and saved, if saved,\nfrom the same evil destiny, by the good of her father in her; but so\nfar as the girl and her mother were concerned, Mrs. Lapham knew that\nher husband was to blame for nothing but his wilful, wrong-headed,\nkind-heartedness, which her own exactions had turned into deceit.  She\nremained a while, questioning the girl quietly about herself and her\nmother, and then, with a better mind towards Zerrilla, at least, than\nshe had ever had before, she rose up and went out.  There must have\nbeen some outer hint of the exhaustion in which the subsidence of her\nexcitement had left her within, for before she had reached the head of\nthe stairs, Corey came towards her.\n\n\"Can I be of any use to you, Mrs. Lapham? The Colonel was here just\nbefore you came in, on his way to the train.\"\n\n\"Yes,--yes. I didn't know--I thought perhaps I could catch him here.\nBut it don't matter.  I wish you would let some one go with me to get a\ncarriage,\" she begged feebly.\n\n\"I'll go with you myself,\" said the young fellow, ignoring the\nstrangeness in her manner.  He offered her his arm in the twilight of\nthe staircase, and she was glad to put her trembling hand through it,\nand keep it there till he helped her into a hack which he found for\nher.  He gave the driver her direction, and stood looking a little\nanxiously at her.\n\n\"I thank you; I am all right now,\" she said, and he bade the man drive\non.\n\nWhen she reached home she went to bed, spent with the tumult of her\nemotions and sick with shame and self-reproach.  She understood now, as\nclearly as if he had told her in as many words, that if he had\nbefriended those worthless jades--the Millons characterised themselves\nso, even to Mrs. Lapham's remorse--secretly and in defiance of her, it\nwas because he dreaded her blame, which was so sharp and bitter, for\nwhat he could not help doing.  It consoled her that he had defied her,\ndeceived her; when he came back she should tell him that; and then it\nflashed upon her that she did not know where he was gone, or whether he\nwould ever come again.  If he never came, it would be no more than she\ndeserved; but she sent for Penelope, and tried to give herself hopes of\nescape from this just penalty.\n\nLapham had not told his daughter where he was going; she had heard him\npacking his bag, and had offered to help him; but he had said he could\ndo it best, and had gone off, as he usually did, without taking leave\nof any one.\n\n\"What were you talking about so loud, down in the parlour,\" she asked\nher mother, \"just before he came up. Is there any new trouble?\"\n\n\"No; it was nothing.\"\n\n\"I couldn't tell.  Once I thought you were laughing.\" She went about,\nclosing the curtains on account of her mother's headache, and doing\nawkwardly and imperfectly the things that Irene would have done so\nskilfully for her comfort.\n\nThe day wore away to nightfall, and then Mrs. Lapham said she MUST\nknow.  Penelope said there was no one to ask; the clerks would all be\ngone home, and her mother said yes, there was Mr. Corey; they could\nsend and ask him; he would know.\n\nThe girl hesitated.  \"Very well,\" she said, then, scarcely above a\nwhisper, and she presently laughed huskily.  \"Mr. Corey seems fated to\ncome in, somewhere.  I guess it's a Providence, mother.\"\n\nShe sent off a note, inquiring whether he could tell her just where her\nfather had expected to be that night; and the answer came quickly back\nthat Corey did not know, but would look up the book-keeper and inquire.\nThis office brought him in person, an hour later, to tell Penelope that\nthe Colonel was to be at Lapham that night and next day.\n\n\"He came in from New York, in a great hurry, and rushed off as soon as\nhe could pack his bag,\" Penelope explained, \"and we hadn't a chance to\nask him where he was to be to-night. And mother wasn't very well,\nand----\"\n\n\"I thought she wasn't looking well when she was at the office to-day.\nAnd so I thought I would come rather than send,\" Corey explained in his\nturn.\n\n\"Oh, thank you!\"\n\n\"If there is anything I can do--telegraph Colonel Lapham, or anything?\"\n\n\"Oh no, thank you; mother's better now.  She merely wanted to be sure\nwhere he was.\"\n\nHe did not offer to go, upon this conclusion of his business, but hoped\nhe was not keeping her from her mother.  She thanked him once again,\nand said no, that her mother was much better since she had had a cup of\ntea; and then they looked at each other, and without any apparent\nexchange of intelligence he remained, and at eleven o'clock he was\nstill there.  He was honest in saying he did not know it was so late;\nbut he made no pretence of being sorry, and she took the blame to\nherself.\n\n\"I oughtn't to have let you stay,\" she said.  \"But with father gone,\nand all that trouble hanging over us----\"\n\nShe was allowing him to hold her hand a moment at the door, to which\nshe had followed him.\n\n\"I'm so glad you could let me!\" he said, \"and I want to ask you now\nwhen I may come again.  But if you need me, you'll----\"\n\nA sharp pull at the door-bell outside made them start asunder, and at a\nsign from Penelope, who knew that the maids were abed by this time, he\nopened it.\n\n\"Why, Irene!\" shrieked the girl.\n\nIrene entered with the hackman, who had driven her unheard to the door,\nfollowing with her small bags, and kissed her sister with resolute\ncomposure.  \"That's all,\" she said to the hackman.  \"I gave my checks\nto the expressman,\" she explained to Penelope.\n\nCorey stood helpless.  Irene turned upon him, and gave him her hand.\n\"How do you do, Mr. Corey?\" she said, with a courage that sent a thrill\nof admiring gratitude through him.  \"Where's mamma, Pen? Papa gone to\nbed?\"\n\nPenelope faltered out some reply embodying the facts, and Irene ran up\nthe stairs to her mother's room.  Mrs. Lapham started up in bed at her\napparition.\n\n\"Irene Lapham.\"\n\n\"Uncle William thought he ought to tell me the trouble papa was in; and\ndid you think I was going to stay off there junketing, while you were\ngoing through all this at home, and Pen acting so silly, too? You ought\nto have been ashamed to let me stay so long! I started just as soon as\nI could pack.  Did you get my despatch? I telegraphed from Springfield.\nBut it don't matter, now.  Here I am.  And I don't think I need have\nhurried on Pen's account,\" she added, with an accent prophetic of the\nsort of old maid she would become, if she happened not to marry.\n\n\"Did you see him?\" asked her mother.  \"It's the first time he's been\nhere since she told him he mustn't come.\"\n\n\"I guess it isn't the last time, by the looks,\" said Irene, and before\nshe took off her bonnet she began to undo some of Penelope's mistaken\narrangements of the room.\n\nAt breakfast, where Corey and his mother met the next morning before\nhis father and sisters came down, he told her, with embarrassment which\ntold much more, that he wished now that she would go and call upon the\nLaphams.\n\nMrs. Corey turned a little pale, but shut her lips tight and mourned in\nsilence whatever hopes she had lately permitted herself.  She answered\nwith Roman fortitude: \"Of course, if there's anything between you and\nMiss Lapham, your family ought to recognise it.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Corey.\n\n\"You were reluctant to have me call at first, but now if the affair is\ngoing on----\"\n\n\"It is! I hope--yes, it is!\"\n\n\"Then I ought to go and see her, with your sisters; and she ought to\ncome here and--we ought all to see her and make the matter public.  We\ncan't do so too soon.  It will seem as if we were ashamed if we don't.\"\n\n\"Yes, you are quite right, mother,\" said the young man gratefully, \"and\nI feel how kind and good you are.  I have tried to consider you in this\nmatter, though I don't seem to have done so; I know what your rights\nare, and I wish with all my heart that I were meeting even your tastes\nperfectly.  But I know you will like her when you come to know her.\nIt's been very hard for her every way--about her sister,--and she's\nmade a great sacrifice for me.  She's acted nobly.\"\n\nMrs. Corey, whose thoughts cannot always be reported, said she was sure\nof it, and that all she desired was her son's happiness.\n\n\"She's been very unwilling to consider it an engagement on that\naccount, and on account of Colonel Lapham's difficulties.  I should\nlike to have you go, now, for that very reason.  I don't know just how\nserious the trouble is; but it isn't a time when we can seem\nindifferent.\"\n\nThe logic of this was not perhaps so apparent to the glasses of fifty\nas to the eyes of twenty-six; but Mrs. Corey, however she viewed it,\ncould not allow herself to blench before the son whom she had taught\nthat to want magnanimity was to be less than gentlemanly.  She\nanswered, with what composure she could, \"I will take your sisters,\"\nand then she made some natural inquiries about Lapham's affairs.  \"Oh,\nI hope it will come out all right,\" Corey said, with a lover's vague\nsmile, and left her.  When his father came down, rubbing his long hands\ntogether, and looking aloof from all the cares of the practical world,\nin an artistic withdrawal, from which his eye ranged over the\nbreakfast-table before he sat down, Mrs. Corey told him what she and\ntheir son had been saying.\n\nHe laughed, with a delicate impersonal appreciation of the predicament.\n\"Well, Anna, you can't say but if you ever were guilty of supposing\nyourself porcelain, this is a just punishment of your arrogance.  Here\nyou are bound by the very quality on which you've prided yourself to\nbehave well to a bit of earthenware who is apparently in danger of\nlosing the gilding that rendered her tolerable.\"\n\n\"We never cared for the money,\" said Mrs. Corey.  \"You know that.\"\n\n\"No; and now we can't seem to care for the loss of it.  That would be\nstill worse.  Either horn of the dilemma gores us.  Well, we still have\nthe comfort we had in the beginning; we can't help ourselves; and we\nshould only make bad worse by trying.  Unless we can look to Tom's\ninamorata herself for help.\"\n\nMrs. Corey shook her head so gloomily that her husband broke off with\nanother laugh.  But at the continued trouble of her face, he said,\nsympathetically: \"My dear, I know it's a very disagreeable affair; and\nI don't think either of us has failed to see that it was so from the\nbeginning.  I have had my way of expressing my sense of it, and you\nyours, but we have always been of the same mind about it.  We would\nboth have preferred to have Tom marry in his own set; the Laphams are\nabout the last set we could have wished him to marry into.  They ARE\nuncultivated people, and so far as I have seen them, I'm not able to\nbelieve that poverty will improve them.  Still, it may.  Let us hope\nfor the best, and let us behave as well as we know how.  I'm sure YOU\nwill behave well, and I shall try.  I'm going with you to call on Miss\nLapham.  This is a thing that can't be done by halves!\"\n\nHe cut his orange in the Neapolitan manner, and ate it in quarters.\n\n\n\nXXVII.\n\n\nIRENE did not leave her mother in any illusion concerning her cousin\nWill and herself.  She said they had all been as nice to her as they\ncould be, and when Mrs. Lapham hinted at what had been in her\nthoughts,--or her hopes, rather,--Irene severely snubbed the notion.\nShe said that he was as good as engaged to a girl out there, and that\nhe had never dreamt of her.  Her mother wondered at her severity; in\nthese few months the girl had toughened and hardened; she had lost all\nher babyish dependence and pliability; she was like iron; and here and\nthere she was sharpened to a cutting edge.  It had been a life and\ndeath struggle with her; she had conquered, but she had also\nnecessarily lost much.  Perhaps what she had lost was not worth\nkeeping; but at any rate she had lost it.\n\nShe required from her mother a strict and accurate account of her\nfather's affairs, so far as Mrs Lapham knew them; and she showed a\nbusiness-like quickness in comprehending them that Penelope had never\npretended to.  With her sister she ignored the past as completely as it\nwas possible to do; and she treated both Corey and Penelope with the\njustice which their innocence of voluntary offence deserved.  It was a\ndifficult part, and she kept away from them as much as she could.  She\nhad been easily excused, on a plea of fatigue from her journey, when\nMr. and Mrs. Corey had called the day after her arrival, and Mrs.\nLapham being still unwell, Penelope received them alone.\n\nThe girl had instinctively judged best that they should know the worst\nat once, and she let them have the full brunt of the drawing-room,\nwhile she was screwing her courage up to come down and see them.  She\nwas afterwards--months afterwards--able to report to Corey that when\nshe entered the room his father was sitting with his hat on his knees,\na little tilted away from the Emancipation group, as if he expected the\nLincoln to hit him, with that lifted hand of benediction; and that Mrs.\nCorey looked as if she were not sure but the Eagle pecked.  But for the\ntime being Penelope was as nearly crazed as might be by the\ncomplications of her position, and received her visitors with a piteous\ndistraction which could not fail of touching Bromfield Corey's\nItalianised sympatheticism.  He was very polite and tender with her at\nfirst, and ended by making a joke with her, to which Penelope\nresponded, in her sort.  He said he hoped they parted friends, if not\nquite acquaintances; and she said she hoped they would be able to\nrecognise each other if they ever met again.\n\n\"That is what I meant by her pertness,\" said Mrs Corey, when they were\ndriving away.\n\n\"Was it very pert?\" he queried.  \"The child had to answer something.\"\n\n\"I would much rather she had answered nothing, under the\ncircumstances,\" said Mrs. Corey.  \"However!\" she added hopelessly.\n\"Oh, she's a merry little grig, you can see that, and there's no harm\nin her.  I can understand a little why a formal fellow like Tom should\nbe taken with her.  She hasn't the least reverence, I suppose, and\njoked with the young man from the beginning.  You must remember, Anna,\nthat there was a time when you liked my joking.\"\n\n\"It was a very different thing!\"\n\n\"But that drawing-room,\" pursued Corey; \"really, I don't see how Tom\nstands that.  Anna, a terrible thought occurs to me! Fancy Tom being\nmarried in front of that group, with a floral horse-shoe in tuberoses\ncoming down on either side of it!\"\n\n\"Bromfield!\" cried his wife, \"you are unmerciful.\"\n\n\"No, no, my dear,\" he argued; \"merely imaginative.  And I can even\nimagine that little thing finding Tom just the least bit slow, at\ntimes, if it were not for his goodness.  Tom is so kind that I'm\nconvinced he sometimes feels your joke in his heart when his head isn't\nquite clear about it.  Well, we will not despond, my dear.\"\n\n\"Your father seemed actually to like her,\" Mrs. Corey reported to her\ndaughters, very much shaken in her own prejudices by the fact.  If the\ngirl were not so offensive to his fastidiousness, there might be some\nhope that she was not so offensive as Mrs. Corey had thought.  \"I\nwonder how she will strike YOU,\" she concluded, looking from one\ndaughter to another, as if trying to decide which of them would like\nPenelope least.\n\nIrene's return and the visit of the Coreys formed a distraction for the\nLaphams in which their impending troubles seemed to hang further aloof;\nbut it was only one of those reliefs which mark the course of\nadversity, and it was not one of the cheerful reliefs.  At any other\ntime, either incident would have been an anxiety and care for Mrs.\nLapham which she would have found hard to bear; but now she almost\nwelcomed them.  At the end of three days Lapham returned, and his wife\nmet him as if nothing unusual had marked their parting; she reserved\nher atonement for a fitter time; he would know now from the way she\nacted that she felt all right towards him.  He took very little note of\nher manner, but met his family with an austere quiet that puzzled her,\nand a sort of pensive dignity that refined his rudeness to an effect\nthat sometimes comes to such natures after long sickness, when the\nanimal strength has been taxed and lowered.  He sat silent with her at\nthe table after their girls had left them alone, and seeing that he did\nnot mean to speak, she began to explain why Irene had come home, and to\npraise her.\n\n\"Yes, she done right,\" said Lapham.  \"It was time for her to come,\" he\nadded gently.\n\nThen he was silent again, and his wife told him of Corey's having been\nthere, and of his father's and mother's calling.  \"I guess Pen's\nconcluded to make it up,\" she said.\n\n\"Well, we'll see about that,\" said Lapham; and now she could no longer\nforbear to ask him about his affairs.\n\n\"I don't know as I've got any right to know anything about it,\" she\nsaid humbly, with remote allusion to her treatment of him.  \"But I\ncan't help wanting to know.  How ARE things going, Si?\"\n\n\"Bad,\" he said, pushing his plate from him, and tilting himself back in\nhis chair.  \"Or they ain't going at all.  They've stopped.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Si?\" she persisted, tenderly.\n\n\"I've got to the end of my string.  To-morrow I shall call a meeting of\nmy creditors, and put myself in their hands.  If there's enough left to\nsatisfy them, I'm satisfied.\" His voice dropped in his throat; he\nswallowed once or twice, and then did not speak.\n\n\"Do you mean that it's all over with you?\" she asked fearfully.\n\nHe bowed his big head, wrinkled and grizzled; and after awhile he said,\n\"It's hard to realise it; but I guess there ain't any doubt about it.\"\nHe drew a long breath, and then he explained to her about the West\nVirginia people, and how he had got an extension of the first time they\nhad given him, and had got a man to go up to Lapham with him and look\nat the works,--a man that had turned up in New York, and wanted to put\nmoney in the business.  His money would have enabled Lapham to close\nwith the West Virginians.  \"The devil was in it, right straight along,\"\nsaid Lapham.  \"All I had to do was to keep quiet about that other\ncompany.  It was Rogers and his property right over again.  He liked\nthe look of things, and he wanted to go into the business, and he had\nthe money--plenty; it would have saved me with those West Virginia\nfolks.  But I had to tell him how I stood.  I had to tell him all about\nit, and what I wanted to do.  He began to back water in a minute, and\nthe next morning I saw that it was up with him.  He's gone back to New\nYork.  I've lost my last chance.  Now all I've got to do is to save the\npieces.\"\n\n\"Will--will--everything go?\" she asked.\n\n\"I can't tell, yet.  But they shall have a chance at everything--every\ndollar, every cent.  I'm sorry for you, Persis--and the girls.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't talk of US!\" She was trying to realise that the simple, rude\nsoul to which her heart clove in her youth, but which she had put to\nsuch cruel proof, with her unsparing conscience and her unsparing\ntongue, had been equal to its ordeals, and had come out unscathed and\nunstained.  He was able in his talk to make so little of them; he\nhardly seemed to see what they were; he was apparently not proud of\nthem, and certainly not glad; if they were victories of any sort, he\nbore them with the patience of defeat.  His wife wished to praise him,\nbut she did not know how; so she offered him a little reproach, in\nwhich alone she touched the cause of her behaviour at parting.\n\"Silas,\" she asked, after a long gaze at him, \"why didn't you tell me\nyou had Jim Millon's girl there?\"\n\n\"I didn't suppose you'd like it, Persis,\" he answered.  \"I did intend\nto tell you at first, but then I put--I put it off.  I thought you'd\ncome round some day, and find it out for yourself.\"\n\n\"I'm punished,\" said his wife, \"for not taking enough interest in your\nbusiness to even come near it.  If we're brought back to the day of\nsmall things, I guess it's a lesson for me, Silas.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know about the lesson,\" he said wearily.\n\nThat night she showed him the anonymous scrawl which had kindled her\nfury against him.  He turned it listlessly over in his hand.  \"I guess\nI know who it's from,\" he said, giving it back to her, \"and I guess you\ndo too, Persis.\"\n\n\"But how--how could he----\"\n\n\"Mebbe he believed it,\" said Lapham, with patience that cut her more\nkeenly than any reproach.  \"YOU did.\"\n\nPerhaps because the process of his ruin had been so gradual, perhaps\nbecause the excitement of preceding events had exhausted their capacity\nfor emotion, the actual consummation of his bankruptcy brought a\nrelief, a repose to Lapham and his family, rather than a fresh\nsensation of calamity.  In the shadow of his disaster they returned to\nsomething like their old, united life; they were at least all together\nagain; and it will be intelligible to those whom life has blessed with\nvicissitude, that Lapham should come home the evening after he had\ngiven up everything, to his creditors, and should sit down to his\nsupper so cheerful that Penelope could joke him in the old way, and\ntell him that she thought from his looks they had concluded to pay him\na hundred cents on every dollar he owed them.\n\nAs James Bellingham had taken so much interest in his troubles from the\nfirst, Lapham thought he ought to tell him, before taking the final\nstep, just how things stood with him, and what he meant to do.\nBellingham made some futile inquiries about his negotiations with the\nWest Virginians, and Lapham told him they had come to nothing.  He\nspoke of the New York man, and the chance that he might have sold out\nhalf his business to him.  \"But, of course, I had to let him know how\nit was about those fellows.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Bellingham, not seeing till afterwards the full\nsignificance of Lapham's action.\n\nLapham said nothing about Rogers and the Englishmen.  He believed that\nhe had acted right in that matter, and he was satisfied; but he did not\ncare to have Bellingham, or anybody, perhaps, think he had been a fool.\n\nAll those who were concerned in his affairs said he behaved well, and\neven more than well, when it came to the worst.  The prudence, the good\nsense, which he had shown in the first years of his success, and of\nwhich his great prosperity seemed to have bereft him, came back, and\nthese qualities, used in his own behalf, commended him as much to his\ncreditors as the anxiety he showed that no one should suffer by him;\nthis even made some of them doubtful of his sincerity.  They gave him\ntime, and there would have been no trouble in his resuming on the old\nbasis, if the ground had not been cut from under him by the competition\nof the West Virginia company.  He saw himself that it was useless to\ntry to go on in the old way, and he preferred to go back and begin the\nworld anew where he had first begun it, in the hills at Lapham.  He put\nthe house at Nankeen Square, with everything else he had, into the\npayment of his debts, and Mrs. Lapham found it easier to leave it for\nthe old farmstead in Vermont than it would have been to go from that\nhome of many years to the new house on the water side of Beacon.  This\nthing and that is embittered to us, so that we may be willing to\nrelinquish it; the world, life itself, is embittered to most of us, so\nthat we are glad to have done with them at last; and this home was\nhaunted with such memories to each of those who abandoned it that to go\nwas less exile than escape.  Mrs. Lapham could not look into Irene's\nroom without seeing the girl there before her glass, tearing the poor\nlittle keep-sakes of her hapless fancy from their hiding-places to take\nthem and fling them in passionate renunciation upon her sister; she\ncould not come into the sitting-room, where her little ones had grown\nup, without starting at the thought of her husband sitting so many\nweary nights at his desk there, trying to fight his way back to hope\nout of the ruin into which he was slipping.  When she remembered that\nnight when Rogers came, she hated the place.  Irene accepted her\nrelease from the house eagerly, and was glad to go before and prepare\nfor the family at Lapham.  Penelope was always ashamed of her\nengagement there; it must seem better somewhere else and she was glad\nto go too.  No one but Lapham in fact, felt the pang of parting in all\nits keenness.  Whatever regret the others had was softened to them by\nthe likeness of their flitting to many of those removals for the summer\nwhich they made in the late spring when they left Nankeen Square; they\nwere going directly into the country instead of to the seaside first;\nbut Lapham, who usually remained in town long after they had gone, knew\nall the difference.  For his nerves there was no mechanical sense of\ncoming back; this was as much the end of his proud, prosperous life as\ndeath itself could have been.  He was returning to begin life anew, but\nhe knew as well as he knew that he should not find his vanished youth\nin his native hills, that it could never again be the triumph that it\nhad been.  That was impossible, not only in his stiffened and weakened\nforces, but in the very nature of things.  He was going back, by grace\nof the man whom he owed money, to make what he could out of the one\nchance which his successful rivals had left him.\n\nIn one phase his paint had held its own against bad times and ruinous\ncompetition, and it was with the hope of doing still more with the\nPersis Brand that he now set himself to work.  The West Virginia people\nconfessed that they could not produce those fine grades, and they\nwillingly left the field to him.  A strange, not ignoble friendliness\nexisted between Lapham and the three brothers; they had used him\nfairly; it was their facilities that had conquered him, not their\nill-will; and he recognised in them without enmity the necessity to\nwhich he had yielded.  If he succeeded in his efforts to develop his\npaint in this direction, it must be for a long time on a small scale\ncompared with his former business, which it could never equal, and he\nbrought to them the flagging energies of an elderly man.  He was more\nbroken than he knew by his failure; it did not kill, as it often does,\nbut it weakened the spring once so strong and elastic.  He lapsed more\nand more into acquiescence with his changed condition, and that\nbragging note of his was rarely sounded.  He worked faithfully enough\nin his enterprise, but sometimes he failed to seize occasions that in\nhis younger days he would have turned to golden account.  His wife saw\nin him a daunted look that made her heart ache for him.\n\nOne result of his friendly relations with the West Virginia people was\nthat Corey went in with them, and the fact that he did so solely upon\nLapham's advice, and by means of his recommendation, was perhaps the\nColonel's proudest consolation.  Corey knew the business thoroughly,\nand after half a year at Kanawha Falls and in the office at New York,\nhe went out to Mexico and Central America, to see what could be done\nfor them upon the ground which he had theoretically studied with Lapham.\n\nBefore he went he came up to Vermont, and urged Penelope to go with\nhim.  He was to be first in the city of Mexico, and if his mission was\nsuccessful he was to be kept there and in South America several years,\nwatching the new railroad enterprises and the development of mechanical\nagriculture and whatever other undertakings offered an opening for the\nintroduction of the paint.  They were all young men together, and\nCorey, who had put his money into the company, had a proprietary\ninterest in the success which they were eager to achieve.\n\n\"There's no more reason now and no less than ever there was,\" mused\nPenelope, in counsel with her mother, \"why I should say Yes, or why I\nshould say No. Everything else changes, but this is just where it was a\nyear ago.  It don't go backward, and it don't go forward.  Mother, I\nbelieve I shall take the bit in my teeth--if anybody will put it there!\"\n\n\"It isn't the same as it was,\" suggested her mother.  \"You can see that\nIrene's all over it.\"\n\n\"That's no credit to me,\" said Penelope.  \"I ought to be just as much\nashamed as ever.\"\n\n\"You no need ever to be ashamed.\"\n\n\"That's true, too,\" said the girl.  \"And I can sneak off to Mexico with\na good conscience if I could make up my mind to it.\"  She laughed.\n\"Well, if I could be SENTENCED to be married, or somebody would up and\nforbid the banns! I don't know what to do about it.\"\n\nHer mother left her to carry her hesitation back to Corey, and she said\nnow, they had better go all over it and try to reason it out.  \"And I\nhope that whatever I do, it won't be for my own sake, but for--others!\"\n\nCorey said he was sure of that, and looked at her with eyes of patient\ntenderness.\n\n\"I don't say it is wrong,\" she proceeded, rather aimlessly, \"but I\ncan't make it seem right.  I don't know whether I can make you\nunderstand, but the idea of being happy, when everybody else is so\nmiserable, is more than I can endure.  It makes me wretched.\"\n\n\"Then perhaps that's your share of the common suffering,\" suggested\nCorey, smiling.\n\n\"Oh, you know it isn't! You know it's nothing.  Oh! One of the reasons\nis what I told you once before, that as long as father is in trouble I\ncan't let you think of me.  Now that he's lost everything--?\" She bent\nher eyes inquiringly upon him, as if for the effect of this argument.\n\n\"I don't think that's a very good reason,\" he answered seriously, but\nsmiling still.  \"Do you believe me when I tell you that I love you?\"\n\n\"Why, I suppose I must,\" she said, dropping her eyes.\n\n\"Then why shouldn't I think all the more of you on account of your\nfather's loss? You didn't suppose I cared for you because he was\nprosperous?\"\n\nThere was a shade of reproach, ever so delicate and gentle, in his\nsmiling question, which she felt.\n\n\"No, I couldn't think such a thing of you.  I--I don't know what I\nmeant.  I meant that----\" She could not go on and say that she had felt\nherself more worthy of him because of her father's money; it would not\nhave been true; yet there was no other explanation.  She stopped, and\ncast a helpless glance at him.\n\nHe came to her aid.  \"I understand why you shouldn't wish me to suffer\nby your father's misfortunes.\"\n\n\"Yes, that was it; and there is too great a difference every way.  We\nought to look at that again.  You mustn't pretend that you don't know\nit, for that wouldn't be true.  Your mother will never like me, and\nperhaps--perhaps I shall not like her.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Corey, a little daunted, \"you won't have to marry my\nfamily.\"\n\n\"Ah, that isn't the point!\"\n\n\"I know it,\" he admitted.  \"I won't pretend that I don't see what you\nmean; but I'm sure that all the differences would disappear when you\ncame to know my family better.  I'm not afraid but you and my mother\nwill like each other--she can't help it!\" he exclaimed, less judicially\nthan he had hitherto spoken, and he went on to urge some points of\ndoubtful tenability.  \"We have our ways, and you have yours; and while\nI don't say but what you and my mother and sisters would be a little\nstrange together at first, it would soon wear off, on both sides.\nThere can't be anything hopelessly different in you all, and if there\nwere it wouldn't be any difference to me.\"\n\n\"Do you think it would be pleasant to have you on my side against your\nmother?\"\n\n\"There won't be any sides.  Tell me just what it is you're afraid of.\"\n\n\"Afraid?\"\n\n\"Thinking of, then.\"\n\n\"I don't know.  It isn't anything they say or do,\" she explained, with\nher eyes intent on his.  \"It's what they are.  I couldn't be natural\nwith them, and if I can't be natural with people, I'm disagreeable.\"\n\n\"Can you be natural with me?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm not afraid of you.  I never was.  That was the trouble, from\nthe beginning.\"\n\n\"Well, then, that's all that's necessary.  And it never was the least\ntrouble to me!\"\n\n\"It made me untrue to Irene.\"\n\n\"You mustn't say that! You were always true to her.\"\n\n\"She cared for you first.\"\n\n\"Well, but I never cared for her at all!\" he besought her.\n\n\"She thought you did.\"\n\n\"That was nobody's fault, and I can't let you make it yours.  My\ndear----\"\n\n\"Wait. We must understand each other,\" said Penelope, rising from her\nseat to prevent an advance he was making from his; \"I want you to\nrealise the whole affair.  Should you want a girl who hadn't a cent in\nthe world, and felt different in your mother's company, and had cheated\nand betrayed her own sister?\"\n\n\"I want you!\"\n\n\"Very well, then, you can't have me.  I should always despise myself.\nI ought to give you up for all these reasons.  Yes, I must.\" She looked\nat him intently, and there was a tentative quality in her affirmations.\n\n\"Is this your answer?\" he said.  \"I must submit.  If I asked too much\nof you, I was wrong.  And--good-bye.\"\n\nHe held out his hand, and she put hers in it.  \"You think I'm\ncapricious and fickle!\" she said.  \"I can't help it--I don't know\nmyself.  I can't keep to one thing for half a day at a time.  But it's\nright for us to part--yes, it must be.  It must be,\" she repeated; \"and\nI shall try to remember that.  Good-bye! I will try to keep that in my\nmind, and you will too--you won't care, very soon! I didn't mean\nTHAT--no; I know how true you are; but you will soon look at me\ndifferently; and see that even IF there hadn't been this about Irene, I\nwas not the one for you.  You do think so, don't you?\" she pleaded,\nclinging to his hand.  \"I am not at all what they would like--your\nfamily; I felt that.  I am little, and black, and homely, and they\ndon't understand my way of talking, and now that we've lost\neverything--No, I'm not fit.  Good-bye. You're quite right, not to have\npatience with me any longer.  I've tried you enough.  I ought to be\nwilling to marry you against their wishes if you want me to, but I\ncan't make the sacrifice--I'm too selfish for that----\" All at once she\nflung herself on his breast.  \"I can't even give you up! I shall never\ndare look any one in the face again.  Go, go! But take me with you! I\ntried to do without you! I gave it a fair trial, and it was a dead\nfailure.  O poor Irene! How could she give you up?\"\n\nCorey went back to Boston immediately, and left Penelope, as he must,\nto tell her sister that they were to be married.  She was spared from\nthe first advance toward this by an accident or a misunderstanding.\nIrene came straight to her after Corey was gone, and demanded,\n\"Penelope Lapham, have you been such a ninny as to send that man away\non my account?\"\n\nPenelope recoiled from this terrible courage; she did not answer\ndirectly, and Irene went on, \"Because if you did, I'll thank you to\nbring him back again.  I'm not going to have him thinking that I'm\ndying for a man that never cared for me.  It's insulting, and I'm not\ngoing to stand it.  Now, you just send for him!\"\n\n\"Oh, I will, 'Rene,\" gasped Penelope.  And then she added, shamed out\nof her prevarication by Irene's haughty magnanimity, \"I have.  That\nis--he's coming back----\"\n\nIrene looked at her a moment, and then, whatever thought was in her\nmind, said fiercely, \"Well!\" and left her to her dismay--her dismay and\nher relief, for they both knew that this was the last time they should\never speak of that again.\n\nThe marriage came after so much sorrow and trouble, and the fact was\nreceived with so much misgiving for the past and future, that it\nbrought Lapham none of the triumph in which he had once exulted at the\nthought of an alliance with the Coreys.  Adversity had so far been his\nfriend that it had taken from him all hope of the social success for\nwhich people crawl and truckle, and restored him, through failure and\ndoubt and heartache, the manhood which his prosperity had so nearly\nstolen from him.  Neither he nor his wife thought now that their\ndaughter was marrying a Corey; they thought only that she was giving\nherself to the man who loved her, and their acquiescence was sobered\nstill further by the presence of Irene.  Their hearts were far more\nwith her.\n\nAgain and again Mrs. Lapham said she did not see how she could go\nthrough it.  \"I can't make it seem right,\" she said.\n\n\"It IS right,\" steadily answered the Colonel.\n\n\"Yes, I know.  But it don't SEEM so.\"\n\n\nIt would be easy to point out traits in Penelope's character which\nfinally reconciled all her husband's family and endeared her to them.\nThese things continually happen in novels; and the Coreys, as they had\nalways promised themselves to do, made the best, and not the worst of\nTom's marriage.\n\nThey were people who could value Lapham's behaviour as Tom reported it\nto them.  They were proud of him, and Bromfield Corey, who found a\ndelicate, aesthetic pleasure in the heroism with which Lapham had\nwithstood Rogers and his temptations--something finely dramatic and\nunconsciously effective,--wrote him a letter which would once have\nflattered the rough soul almost to ecstasy, though now he affected to\nslight it in showing it.  \"It's all right if it makes it more\ncomfortable for Pen,\" he said to his wife.\n\nBut the differences remained uneffaced, if not uneffaceable, between\nthe Coreys and Tom Corey's wife.  \"If he had only married the Colonel!\"\nsubtly suggested Nanny Corey.\n\nThere was a brief season of civility and forbearance on both sides,\nwhen he brought her home before starting for Mexico, and her\nfather-in-law made a sympathetic feint of liking Penelope's way of\ntalking, but it is questionable if even he found it so delightful as\nher husband did.  Lily Corey made a little, ineffectual sketch of her,\nwhich she put by with other studies to finish up, sometime, and found\nher rather picturesque in some ways.  Nanny got on with her better than\nthe rest, and saw possibilities for her in the country to which she was\ngoing.  \"As she's quite unformed, socially,\" she explained to her\nmother, \"there is a chance that she will form herself on the Spanish\nmanner, if she stays there long enough, and that when she comes back\nshe will have the charm of, not olives, perhaps, but tortillas,\nwhatever they are: something strange and foreign, even if it's\nborrowed.  I'm glad she's going to Mexico.  At that distance we\ncan--correspond.\"\n\nHer mother sighed, and said bravely that she was sure they all got on\nvery pleasantly as it was, and that she was perfectly satisfied if Tom\nwas.\n\nThere was, in fact, much truth in what she said of their harmony with\nPenelope.  Having resolved, from the beginning, to make the best of the\nworst, it might almost be said that they were supported and consoled in\ntheir good intentions by a higher power.  This marriage had not, thanks\nto an over-ruling Providence, brought the succession of Lapham teas\nupon Bromfield Corey which he had dreaded; the Laphams were far off in\ntheir native fastnesses, and neither Lily nor Nanny Corey was obliged\nto sacrifice herself to the conversation of Irene; they were not even\ncalled upon to make a social demonstration for Penelope at a time when,\nmost people being still out of town, it would have been so easy; she\nand Tom had both begged that there might be nothing of that kind; and\nthough none of the Coreys learned to know her very well in the week she\nspent with them, they did not find it hard to get on with her.  There\nwere even moments when Nanny Corey, like her father, had glimpses of\nwhat Tom had called her humour, but it was perhaps too unlike their own\nto be easily recognisable.\n\nWhether Penelope, on her side, found it more difficult to harmonise, I\ncannot say.  She had much more of the harmonising to do, since they\nwere four to one; but then she had gone through so much greater trials\nbefore.  When the door of their carriage closed and it drove off with\nher and her husband to the station, she fetched a long sigh.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Corey, who ought to have known better.\n\n\"Oh, nothing.  I don't think I shall feel strange amongst the Mexicans\nnow.\"\n\nHe looked at her with a puzzled smile, which grew a little graver, and\nthen he put his arm round her and drew her closer to him.  This made\nher cry on his shoulder.  \"I only meant that I should have you all to\nmyself.\" There is no proof that she meant more, but it is certain that\nour manners and customs go for more in life than our qualities.  The\nprice that we pay for civilisation is the fine yet impassable\ndifferentiation of these.  Perhaps we pay too much; but it will not be\npossible to persuade those who have the difference in their favour that\nthis is so.  They may be right; and at any rate, the blank misgiving,\nthe recurring sense of disappointment to which the young people's\ndeparture left the Coreys is to be considered.  That was the end of\ntheir son and brother for them; they felt that; and they were not mean\nor unamiable people.\n\nHe remained three years away.  Some changes took place in that time.\nOne of these was the purchase by the Kanawha Falls Company of the mines\nand works at Lapham.  The transfer relieved Lapham of the load of debt\nwhich he was still labouring under, and gave him an interest in the\nvaster enterprise of the younger men, which he had once vainly hoped to\ngrasp all in his own hand.  He began to tell of this coincidence as\nsomething very striking; and pushing on more actively the special\nbranch of the business left to him, he bragged, quite in his old way,\nof its enormous extension.  His son-in-law, he said, was pushing it in\nMexico and Central America: an idea that they had originally had in\ncommon.  Well, young blood was what was wanted in a thing of that kind.\nNow, those fellows out in West Virginia: all young, and a perfect team!\n\nFor himself, he owned that he had made mistakes; he could see just\nwhere the mistakes were--put his finger right on them.  But one thing\nhe could say: he had been no man's enemy but his own; every dollar,\nevery cent had gone to pay his debts; he had come out with clean hands.\nHe said all this, and much more, to Mr. Sewell the summer after he sold\nout, when the minister and his wife stopped at Lapham on their way\nacross from the White Mountains to Lake Champlain; Lapham had found\nthem on the cars, and pressed them to stop off.\n\nThere were times when Mrs. Lapham had as great pride in the\nclean-handedness with which Lapham had come out as he had himself, but\nher satisfaction was not so constant.  At those times, knowing the\ntemptations he had resisted, she thought him the noblest and grandest\nof men; but no woman could endure to live in the same house with a\nperfect hero, and there were other times when she reminded him that if\nhe had kept his word to her about speculating in stocks, and had looked\nafter the insurance of his property half as carefully as he had looked\nafter a couple of worthless women who had no earthly claim on him, they\nwould not be where they were now.  He humbly admitted it all, and left\nher to think of Rogers herself.  She did not fail to do so, and the\nthought did not fail to restore him to her tenderness again.\n\n\nI do not know how it is that clergymen and physicians keep from telling\ntheir wives the secrets confided to them; perhaps they can trust their\nwives to find them out for themselves whenever they wish.  Sewell had\nlaid before his wife the case of the Laphams after they came to consult\nwith him about Corey's proposal to Penelope, for he wished to be\nconfirmed in his belief that he had advised them soundly; but he had\nnot given her their names, and he had not known Corey's himself.  Now\nhe had no compunctions in talking the affair over with her without the\nveil of ignorance which she had hitherto assumed, for she declared that\nas soon as she heard of Corey's engagement to Penelope, the whole thing\nhad flashed upon her.  \"And that night at dinner I could have told the\nchild that he was in love with her sister by the way he talked about\nher; I heard him; and if she had not been so blindly in love with him\nherself, she would have known it too.  I must say, I can't help feeling\na sort of contempt for her sister.\"\n\n\"Oh, but you must not!\" cried Sewell.  \"That is wrong, cruelly wrong.\nI'm sure that's out of your novel-reading, my dear, and not out of your\nheart.  Come! It grieves me to hear you say such a thing as that.\"\n\n\"Oh, I dare say this pretty thing has got over it--how much character\nshe has got!--and I suppose she'll see somebody else.\"\n\nSewell had to content himself with this partial concession.  As a\nmatter of fact, unless it was the young West Virginian who had come on\nto arrange the purchase of the Works, Irene had not yet seen any one,\nand whether there was ever anything between them is a fact that would\nneed a separate inquiry.  It is certain that at the end of five years\nafter the disappointment which she met so bravely, she was still\nunmarried.  But she was even then still very young, and her life at\nLapham had been varied by visits to the West.  It had also been varied\nby an invitation, made with the politest resolution by Mrs. Corey, to\nvisit in Boston, which the girl was equal to refusing in the same\nspirit.\n\nSewell was intensely interested in the moral spectacle which Lapham\npresented under his changed conditions.  The Colonel, who was more the\nColonel in those hills than he could ever have been on the Back Bay,\nkept him and Mrs. Sewell over night at his house; and he showed the\nminister minutely round the Works and drove him all over his farm.  For\nthis expedition he employed a lively colt which had not yet come of\nage, and an open buggy long past its prime, and was no more ashamed of\nhis turnout than of the finest he had ever driven on the Milldam.  He\nwas rather shabby and slovenly in dress, and he had fallen unkempt,\nafter the country fashion, as to his hair and beard and boots.  The\nhouse was plain, and was furnished with the simpler moveables out of\nthe house in Nankeen Square.  There were certainly all the necessaries,\nbut no luxuries unless the statues of Prayer and Faith might be so\nconsidered.  The Laphams now burned kerosene, of course, and they had\nno furnace in the winter; these were the only hardships the Colonel\ncomplained of; but he said that as soon as the company got to paying\ndividends again,--he was evidently proud of the outlays that for the\npresent prevented this,--he should put in steam heat and naphtha-gas.\nHe spoke freely of his failure, and with a confidence that seemed\ninspired by his former trust in Sewell, whom, indeed, he treated like\nan intimate friend, rather than an acquaintance of two or three\nmeetings.  He went back to his first connection with Rogers, and he put\nbefore Sewell hypothetically his own conclusions in regard to the\nmatter.\n\n\"Sometimes,\" he said, \"I get to thinking it all over, and it seems to\nme I done wrong about Rogers in the first place; that the whole trouble\ncame from that.  It was just like starting a row of bricks.  I tried to\ncatch up and stop 'em from going, but they all tumbled, one after\nanother.  It wa'n't in the nature of things that they could be stopped\ntill the last brick went.  I don't talk much with my wife, any more\nabout it; but I should like to know how it strikes you.\"\n\n\"We can trace the operation of evil in the physical world,\" replied the\nminister, \"but I'm more and more puzzled about it in the moral world.\nThere its course is often so very obscure; and often it seems to\ninvolve, so far as we can see, no penalty whatever.  And in your own\ncase, as I understand, you don't admit--you don't feel sure--that you\never actually did wrong this man----\"\n\n\"Well, no; I don't. That is to say----\"\n\nHe did not continue, and after a while Sewell said, with that subtle\nkindness of his, \"I should be inclined to think--nothing can be thrown\nquite away; and it can't be that our sins only weaken us--that your\nfear of having possibly behaved selfishly toward this man kept you on\nyour guard, and strengthened you when you were brought face to face\nwith a greater\"--he was going to say temptation, but he saved Lapham's\npride, and said--\"emergency.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\"\n\n\"I think that there may be truth in what I suggest.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know what it was,\" said Lapham; \"all I know is that when\nit came to the point, although I could see that I'd got to go under\nunless I did it--that I couldn't sell out to those Englishmen, and I\ncouldn't let that man put his money into my business without I told him\njust how things stood.\"\n\nAs Sewell afterwards told his wife, he could see that the loss of his\nfortune had been a terrible trial to Lapham, just because his\nprosperity had been so gross and palpable; and he had now a burning\ndesire to know exactly how, at the bottom of his heart, Lapham still\nfelt. \"And do you ever have any regrets?\" he delicately inquired of\nhim.\n\n\"About what I done? Well, it don't always seem as if I done it,\"\nreplied Lapham. \"Seems sometimes as if it was a hole opened for me,\nand I crept out of it. I don't know,\" he added thoughtfully, biting\nthe corner of his stiff moustache. \"I don't know as I should always\nsay it paid; but if I done it, and the thing was to do over again,\nright in the same way, I guess I should have to do it.\"",
