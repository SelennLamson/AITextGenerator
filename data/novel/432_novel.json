The situation\ninvolved is gathered up betimes, that is in the second chapter of Book\nFifth, for the reader’s benefit, into as few words as possible—planted\nor “sunk,” stiffly and saliently, in the centre of the current, almost\nperhaps to the obstruction of traffic. Never can a composition of this\nsort have sprung straighter from a dropped grain of suggestion, and\nnever can that grain, developed, overgrown and smothered, have yet\nlurked more in the mass as an independent particle. The whole case, in\nfine, is in Lambert Strether’s irrepressible outbreak to little Bilham\non the Sunday afternoon in Gloriani’s garden, the candour with which he\nyields, for his young friend’s enlightenment, to the charming\nadmonition of that crisis. The idea of the tale resides indeed in the\nvery fact that an hour of such unprecedented ease should have been felt\nby him _as_ a crisis, and he is at pains to express it for us as neatly\nas we could desire. The remarks to which he thus gives utterance\ncontain the essence of “The Ambassadors,” his fingers close, before he\nhas done, round the stem of the full-blown flower; which, after that\nfashion, he continues officiously to present to us. “Live all you can;\nit’s a mistake not to. It doesn’t so much matter what you do in\nparticular so long as you have your life. If you haven’t had that what\n_have_ you had? I’m too old—too old at any rate for what I see. What\none loses one loses; make no mistake about that. Still, we have the\nillusion of freedom; therefore don’t, like me to-day, be without the\nmemory of that illusion. I was either, at the right time, too stupid or\ntoo intelligent to have it, and now I’m a case of reaction against the\nmistake. Do what you like so long as you don’t make it. For it _was_ a\nmistake. Live, live!” Such is the gist of Strether’s appeal to the\nimpressed youth, whom he likes and whom he desires to befriend; the\nword “mistake” occurs several times, it will be seen, in the course of\nhis remarks—which gives the measure of the signal warning he feels\nattached to his case. He has accordingly missed too much, though\nperhaps after all constitutionally qualified for a better part, and he\nwakes up to it in conditions that press the spring of a terrible\nquestion. _Would_ there yet perhaps be time for reparation?—reparation,\nthat is, for the injury done his character; for the affront, he is\nquite ready to say, so stupidly put upon it and in which he has even\nhimself had so clumsy a hand? The answer to which is that he now at all\nevents _sees_; so that the business of my tale and the march of my\naction, not to say the precious moral of everything, is just my\ndemonstration of this process of vision.\n\nNothing can exceed the closeness with which the whole fits again into\nits germ. That had been given me bodily, as usual, by the spoken word,\nfor I was to take the image over exactly as I happened to have met it.\nA friend had repeated to me, with great appreciation, a thing or two\nsaid to him by a man of distinction, much his senior, and to which a\nsense akin to that of Strether’s melancholy eloquence might be\nimputed—said as chance would have, and so easily might, in Paris, and\nin a charming old garden attached to a house of art, and on a Sunday\nafternoon of summer, many persons of great interest being present. The\nobservation there listened to and gathered up had contained part of the\n“note” that I was to recognise on the spot as to my purpose—had\ncontained in fact the greater part; the rest was in the place and the\ntime and the scene they sketched: these constituents clustered and\ncombined to give me further support, to give me what I may call the\nnote absolute. There it stands, accordingly, full in the tideway;\ndriven in, with hard taps, like some strong stake for the noose of a\ncable, the swirl of the current roundabout it. What amplified the hint\nto more than the bulk of hints in general was the gift with it of the\nold Paris garden, for in that token were sealed up values infinitely\nprecious. There was of course the seal to break and each item of the\npacket to count over and handle and estimate; but somehow, in the light\nof the hint, all the elements of a situation of the sort most to my\ntaste were there. I could even remember no occasion on which, so\nconfronted, I had found it of a livelier interest to take stock, in\nthis fashion, of suggested wealth. For I think, verily, that there are\ndegrees of merit in subjects—in spite of the fact that to treat even\none of the most ambiguous with due decency we must for the time, for\nthe feverish and prejudiced hour, at least figure its merit and its\ndignity as _possibly_ absolute. What it comes to, doubtless, is that\neven among the supremely good—since with such alone is it one’s theory\nof one’s honour to be concerned—there is an ideal _beauty_ of goodness\nthe invoked action of which is to raise the artistic faith to its\nmaximum. Then truly, I hold, one’s theme may be said to shine, and that\nof “The Ambassadors,” I confess, wore this glow for me from beginning\nto end. Fortunately thus I am able to estimate this as, frankly, quite\nthe best, “all round,” of all my productions; any failure of that\njustification would have made such an extreme of complacency publicly\nfatuous.\n\nI recall then in this connexion no moment of subjective intermittence,\nnever one of those alarms as for a suspected hollow beneath one’s feet,\na felt ingratitude in the scheme adopted, under which confidence fails\nand opportunity seems but to mock. If the motive of “The Wings of the\nDove,” as I have noted, was to worry me at moments by a sealing-up of\nits face—though without prejudice to its again, of a sudden, fairly\ngrimacing with expression—so in this other business I had absolute\nconviction and constant clearness to deal with; it had been a frank\nproposition, the whole bunch of data, installed on my premises like a\nmonotony of fine weather. (The order of composition, in these things, I\nmay mention, was reversed by the order of publication; the earlier\nwritten of the two books having appeared as the later.) Even under the\nweight of my hero’s years I could feel my postulate firm; even under\nthe strain of the difference between those of Madame de Vionnet and\nthose of Chad Newsome, a difference liable to be denounced as shocking,\nI could still feel it serene. Nothing resisted, nothing betrayed, I\nseem to make out, in this full and sound sense of the matter; it shed\nfrom any side I could turn it to the same golden glow. I rejoiced in\nthe promise of a hero so mature, who would give me thereby the more to\nbite into—since it’s only into thickened motive and accumulated\ncharacter, I think, that the painter of life bites more than a little.\nMy poor friend should have accumulated character, certainly; or rather\nwould be quite naturally and handsomely possessed of it, in the sense\nthat he would have, and would always have felt he had, imagination\ngalore, and that this yet wouldn’t have wrecked him. It was\nimmeasurable, the opportunity to “do” a man of imagination, for if\n_there_ mightn’t be a chance to “bite,” where in the world might it be?\nThis personage of course, so enriched, wouldn’t give me, for his type,\nimagination in _predominance_ or as his prime faculty, nor should I, in\nview of other matters, have found that convenient. So particular a\nluxury—some occasion, that is, for study of the high gift in _supreme_\ncommand of a case or of a career—would still doubtless come on the day\nI should be ready to pay for it; and till then might, as from far back,\nremain hung up well in view and just out of reach. The comparative case\nmeanwhile would serve—it was only on the minor scale that I had treated\nmyself even to comparative cases.\n\nI was to hasten to add however that, happy stopgaps as the minor scale\nhad thus yielded, the instance in hand should enjoy the advantage of\nthe full range of the major; since most immediately to the point was\nthe question of that _supplement_ of situation logically involved in\nour gentleman’s impulse to deliver himself in the Paris garden on the\nSunday afternoon—or if not involved by strict logic then all ideally\nand enchantingly implied in it. (I say “ideally,” because I need scarce\nmention that for development, for expression of its maximum, my\nglimmering story was, at the earliest stage, to have nipped the thread\nof connexion with the possibilities of the actual reported speaker.\n_He_ remains but the happiest of accidents; his actualities, all too\ndefinite, precluded any range of possibilities; it had only been his\ncharming office to project upon that wide field of the artist’s\nvision—which hangs there ever in place like the white sheet suspended\nfor the figures of a child’s magic-lantern—a more fantastic and more\nmoveable shadow.) No privilege of the teller of tales and the handler\nof puppets is more delightful, or has more of the suspense and the\nthrill of a game of difficulty breathlessly played, than just this\nbusiness of looking for the unseen and the occult, in a scheme\nhalf-grasped, by the light or, so to speak, by the clinging scent, of\nthe gage already in hand. No dreadful old pursuit of the hidden slave\nwith bloodhounds and the rag of association can ever, for “excitement,”\nI judge, have bettered it at its best. For the dramatist always, by the\nvery law of his genius, believes not only in a possible right issue\nfrom the rightly-conceived tight place; he does much more than this—he\nbelieves, irresistibly, in the necessary, the precious “tightness” of\nthe place (whatever the issue) on the strength of any respectable hint.\nIt being thus the respectable hint that I had with such avidity picked\nup, what would be the story to which it would most inevitably form the\ncentre? It is part of the charm attendant on such questions that the\n“story,” with the omens true, as I say, puts on from this stage the\nauthenticity of concrete existence. It then is, essentially—it begins\nto be, though it may more or less obscurely lurk, so that the point is\nnot in the least what to make of it, but only, very delightfully and\nvery damnably, where to put one’s hand on it.\n\nIn which truth resides surely much of the interest of that admirable\nmixture for salutary application which we know as art. Art deals with\nwhat we see, it must first contribute full-handed that ingredient; it\nplucks its material, otherwise expressed, in the garden of life—which\nmaterial elsewhere grown is stale and uneatable. But it has no sooner\ndone this than it has to take account of a _process_—from which only\nwhen it’s the basest of the servants of man, incurring ignominious\ndismissal with no “character,” does it, and whether under some muddled\npretext of morality or on any other, pusillanimously edge away. The\nprocess, that of the expression, the literal squeezing-out, of value is\nanother affair—with which the happy luck of mere finding has little to\ndo. The joys of finding, at this stage, are pretty well over; that\nquest of the subject as a whole by “matching,” as the ladies say at the\nshops, the big piece with the snippet, having ended, we assume, with a\ncapture. The subject is found, and if the problem is then transferred\nto the ground of what to do with it the field opens out for any amount\nof doing. This is precisely the infusion that, as I submit, completes\nthe strong mixture. It is on the other hand the part of the business\nthat can least be likened to the chase with horn and hound. It’s all a\nsedentary part—involves as much ciphering, of sorts, as would merit the\nhighest salary paid to a chief accountant. Not, however, that the chief\naccountant hasn’t _his_ gleams of bliss; for the felicity, or at least\nthe equilibrium of the artist’s state dwells less, surely, in the\nfurther delightful complications he can smuggle in than in those he\nsucceeds in keeping out. He sows his seed at the risk of too thick a\ncrop; wherefore yet again, like the gentlemen who audit ledgers, he\nmust keep his head at any price. In consequence of all which, for the\ninterest of the matter, I might seem here to have my choice of\nnarrating my “hunt” for Lambert Strether, of describing the capture of\nthe shadow projected by my friend’s anecdote, or of reporting on the\noccurrences subsequent to that triumph. But I had probably best attempt\na little to glance in each direction; since it comes to me again and\nagain, over this licentious record, that one’s bag of adventures,\nconceived or conceivable, has been only half-emptied by the mere\ntelling of one’s story. It depends so on what one means by that\nequivocal quantity. There is the story of one’s hero, and then, thanks\nto the intimate connexion of things, the story of one’s story itself. I\nblush to confess it, but if one’s a dramatist one’s a dramatist, and\nthe latter imbroglio is liable on occasion to strike me as really the\nmore objective of the two.\n\nThe philosophy imputed to him in that beautiful outbreak, the hour\nthere, amid such happy provision, striking for him, would have been\nthen, on behalf of my man of imagination, to be logically and, as the\nartless craft of comedy has it, “led up” to; the probable course to\nsuch a goal, the goal of so conscious a predicament, would have in\nshort to be finely calculated. Where has he come from and why has he\ncome, what is he doing (as we Anglo-Saxons, and we only, say, in our\nforedoomed clutch of exotic aids to expression) in that _galère?_ To\nanswer these questions plausibly, to answer them as under\ncross-examination in the witness-box by counsel for the prosecution, in\nother words satisfactorily to account for Strether and for his\n“peculiar tone,” was to possess myself of the entire fabric. At the\nsame time the clue to its whereabouts would lie in a certain principle\nof probability: he wouldn’t have indulged in his peculiar tone without\na reason; it would take a felt predicament or a false position to give\nhim so ironic an accent. One hadn’t been noting “tones” all one’s life\nwithout recognising when one heard it the voice of the false position.\nThe dear man in the Paris garden was then admirably and unmistakeably\n_in_ one—which was no small point gained; what next accordingly\nconcerned us was the determination of _this_ identity. One could only\ngo by probabilities, but there was the advantage that the most general\nof the probabilities were virtual certainties. Possessed of our\nfriend’s nationality, to start with, there was a general probability in\nhis narrower localism; which, for that matter, one had really but to\nkeep under the lens for an hour to see it give up its secrets. He would\nhave issued, our rueful worthy, from the very heart of New England—at\nthe heels of which matter of course a perfect train of secrets tumbled\nfor me into the light. They had to be sifted and sorted, and I shall\nnot reproduce the detail of that process; but unmistakeably they were\nall there, and it was but a question, auspiciously, of picking among\nthem. What the “position” would infallibly be, and why, on his hands,\nit had turned “false”—these inductive steps could only be as rapid as\nthey were distinct. I accounted for everything—and “everything” had by\nthis time become the most promising quantity—by the view that he had\ncome to Paris in some state of mind which was literally undergoing, as\na result of new and unexpected assaults and infusions, a change almost\nfrom hour to hour. He had come with a view that might have been figured\nby a clear green liquid, say, in a neat glass phial; and the liquid,\nonce poured into the open cup of _application_, once exposed to the\naction of another air, had begun to turn from green to red, or\nwhatever, and might, for all he knew, be on its way to purple, to\nblack, to yellow. At the still wilder extremes represented perhaps, for\nall he could say to the contrary, by a variability so violent, he would\nat first, naturally, but have gazed in surprise and alarm; whereby the\n_situation_ clearly would spring from the play of wildness and the\ndevelopment of extremes. I saw in a moment that, should this\ndevelopment proceed both with force and logic, my “story” would leave\nnothing to be desired. There is always, of course, for the\nstory-teller, the irresistible determinant and the incalculable\nadvantage of his interest in the story _as such_; it is ever,\nobviously, overwhelmingly, the prime and precious thing (as other than\nthis I have never been able to see it); as to which what makes for it,\nwith whatever headlong energy, may be said to pale before the energy\nwith which it simply makes for itself. It rejoices, none the less, at\nits best, to seem to offer itself in a light, to seem to know, and with\nthe very last knowledge, what it’s about—liable as it yet is at moments\nto be caught by us with its tongue in its cheek and absolutely no\nwarrant but its splendid impudence. Let us grant then that the\nimpudence is always there—there, so to speak, for grace and effect and\n_allure_; there, above all, because the Story is just the spoiled child\nof art, and because, as we are always disappointed when the pampered\ndon’t “play up,” we like it, to that extent, to look all its character.\nIt probably does so, in truth, even when we most flatter ourselves that\nwe negotiate with it by treaty.\n\nAll of which, again, is but to say that the _steps_, for my fable,\nplaced themselves with a prompt and, as it were, functional\nassurance—an air quite as of readiness to have dispensed with logic had\nI been in fact too stupid for my clue. Never, positively, none the\nless, as the links multiplied, had I felt less stupid than for the\ndetermination of poor Strether’s errand and for the apprehension of his\nissue. These things continued to fall together, as by the neat action\nof their own weight and form, even while their commentator scratched\nhis head about them; he easily sees now that they were always well in\nadvance of him. As the case completed itself he had in fact, from a\ngood way behind, to catch up with them, breathless and a little\nflurried, as he best could. _The_ false position, for our belated man\nof the world—belated because he had endeavoured so long to escape being\none, and now at last had really to face his doom—the false position for\nhim, I say, was obviously to have presented himself at the gate of that\nboundless menagerie primed with a moral scheme of the most approved\npattern which was yet framed to break down on any approach to vivid\nfacts; that is to any at all liberal appreciation of them. There would\nhave been of course the case of the Strether prepared, wherever\npresenting himself, only to judge and to feel meanly; but _he_ would\nhave moved for me, I confess, enveloped in no legend whatever. The\nactual man’s note, from the first of our seeing it struck, is the note\nof discrimination, just as his drama is to become, under stress, the\ndrama of discrimination. It would have been his blest imagination, we\nhave seen, that had already helped him to discriminate; the element\nthat was for so much of the pleasure of my cutting thick, as I have\nintimated, into his intellectual, into his moral substance. Yet here it\nwas, at the same time, just here, that a shade for a moment fell across\nthe scene.\n\nThere was the dreadful little old tradition, one of the platitudes of\nthe human comedy, that people’s moral scheme _does_ break down in\nParis; that nothing is more frequently observed; that hundreds of\nthousands of more or less hypocritical or more or less cynical persons\nannually visit the place for the sake of the probable catastrophe, and\nthat I came late in the day to work myself up about it. There was in\nfine the _trivial_ association, one of the vulgarest in the world; but\nwhich give me pause no longer, I think, simply because its vulgarity is\nso advertised. The revolution performed by Strether under the influence\nof the most interesting of great cities was to have nothing to do with\nany _bêtise_ of the imputably “tempted” state; he was to be thrown\nforward, rather, thrown quite with violence, upon his lifelong trick of\nintense reflexion: which friendly test indeed was to bring him out,\nthrough winding passages, through alternations of darkness and light,\nvery much _in_ Paris, but with the surrounding scene itself a minor\nmatter, a mere symbol for more things than had been dreamt of in the\nphilosophy of Woollett. Another surrounding scene would have done as\nwell for our show could it have represented a place in which Strether’s\nerrand was likely to lie and his crisis to await him. The _likely_\nplace had the great merit of sparing me preparations; there would have\nbeen too many involved—not at all impossibilities, only rather worrying\nand delaying difficulties—in positing elsewhere Chad Newsome’s\ninteresting relation, his so interesting complexity of relations.\nStrether’s appointed stage, in fine, could be but Chad’s most luckily\nselected one. The young man had gone in, as they say, for circumjacent\ncharm; and where he would have found it, by the turn of his mind, most\n“authentic,” was where his earnest friend’s analysis would most find\n_him_; as well as where, for that matter, the former’s whole analytic\nfaculty would be led such a wonderful dance.\n\n“The Ambassadors” had been, all conveniently, “arranged for”; its first\nappearance was from month to month, in the _North American Review_\nduring 1903, and I had been open from far back to any pleasant\nprovocation for ingenuity that might reside in one’s actively\nadopting—so as to make it, in its way, a small compositional\nlaw—recurrent breaks and resumptions. I had made up my mind here\nregularly to exploit and enjoy these often rather rude jolts—having\nfound, as I believed an admirable way to it; yet every question of form\nand pressure, I easily remember, paled in the light of the major\npropriety, recognised as soon as really weighed; that of employing but\none centre and keeping it all within my hero’s compass. The thing was\nto be so much this worthy’s intimate adventure that even the projection\nof his consciousness upon it from beginning to end without intermission\nor deviation would probably still leave a part of its value for him,\nand _a fortiori_ for ourselves, unexpressed. I might, however, express\nevery grain of it that there would be room for—on condition of\ncontriving a splendid particular economy. Other persons in no small\nnumber were to people the scene, and each with his or her axe to grind,\nhis or her situation to treat, his or her coherency not to fail of, his\nor her relation to my leading motive, in a word, to establish and carry\non. But Strether’s sense of these things, and Strether’s only, should\navail me for showing them; I should know them but through his more or\nless groping knowledge of them, since his very gropings would figure\namong his most interesting motions, and a full observance of the rich\nrigour I speak of would give me more of the effect I should be most\n“after” than all other possible observances together. It would give me\na large unity, and that in turn would crown me with the grace to which\nthe enlightened story-teller will at any time, for his interest,\nsacrifice if need be all other graces whatever. I refer of course to\nthe grace of intensity, which there are ways of signally achieving and\nways of signally missing—as we see it, all round us, helplessly and\nwoefully missed. Not that it isn’t, on the other hand, a virtue\neminently subject to appreciation—there being no strict, no absolute\nmeasure of it; so that one may hear it acclaimed where it has quite\nescaped one’s perception, and see it unnoticed where one has gratefully\nhailed it. After all of which I am not sure, either, that the immense\namusement of the whole cluster of difficulties so arrayed may not\noperate, for the fond fabulist, when judicious not less than fond, as\nhis best of determinants. That charming principle is always there, at\nall events, to keep interest fresh: it is a principle, we remember,\nessentially ravenous, without scruple and without mercy, appeased with\nno cheap nor easy nourishment. It enjoys the costly sacrifice and\nrejoices thereby in the very odour of difficulty—even as ogres, with\ntheir “Fee-faw-fum!” rejoice in the smell of the blood of Englishmen.\n\nThus it was, at all events, that the ultimate, though after all so\nspeedy, definition of my gentleman’s job—his coming out, all solemnly\nappointed and deputed, to “save” Chad, and his then finding the young\nman so disobligingly and, at first, so bewilderingly not lost that a\nnew issue altogether, in the connexion, prodigiously faces them, which\nhas to be dealt with in a new light—promised as many calls on ingenuity\nand on the higher branches of the compositional art as one could\npossibly desire. Again and yet again, as, from book to book, I proceed\nwith my survey, I find no source of interest equal to this verification\nafter the fact, as I may call it, and the more in detail the better, of\nthe scheme of consistency “gone in” for. As always—since the charm\nnever fails—the retracing of the process from point to point brings\nback the old illusion. The old intentions bloom again and flower—in\nspite of all the blossoms they were to have dropped by the way. This is\nthe charm, as I say, of adventure _transposed_—the thrilling ups and\ndowns, the intricate ins and outs of the compositional problem, made\nafter such a fashion admirably objective, becoming the question at\nissue and keeping the author’s heart in his mouth. Such an element, for\ninstance, as his intention that Mrs. Newsome, away off with her finger\non the pulse of Massachusetts, should yet be no less intensely than\ncircuitously present through the whole thing, should be no less felt as\nto be reckoned with than the most direct exhibition, the finest\nportrayal at first hand could make her, such a sign of artistic good\nfaith, I say, once it’s unmistakeably there, takes on again an\nactuality not too much impaired by the comparative dimness of the\nparticular success. Cherished intention too inevitably acts and\noperates, in the book, about fifty times as little as I had fondly\ndreamt it might; but that scarce spoils for me the pleasure of\nrecognising the fifty ways in which I had sought to provide for it. The\nmere charm of seeing such an idea constituent, in its degree; the\nfineness of the measures taken—a real extension, if successful, of the\nvery terms and possibilities of representation and figuration—such\nthings alone were, after this fashion, inspiring, such things alone\nwere a gage of the probable success of that dissimulated calculation\nwith which the whole effort was to square. But oh the cares begotten,\nnone the less, of that same “judicious” sacrifice to a particular form\nof interest! One’s work should have composition, because composition\nalone is positive beauty; but all the while—apart from one’s inevitable\nconsciousness too of the dire paucity of readers ever recognising or\never missing positive beauty—how, as to the cheap and easy, at every\nturn, how, as to immediacy and facility, and even as to the commoner\nvivacity, positive beauty might have to be sweated for and paid for!\nOnce achieved and installed it may always be trusted to make the poor\nseeker feel he would have blushed to the roots of his hair for failing\nof it; yet, how, as its virtue can be essentially but the virtue of the\nwhole, the wayside traps set in the interest of muddlement and pleading\nbut the cause of the moment, of the particular bit in itself, have to\nbe kicked out of the path! All the sophistications in life, for\nexample, might have appeared to muster on behalf of the menace—the\nmenace to a bright variety—involved in Strether’s having all the\nsubjective “say,” as it were, to himself.\n\nHad I, meanwhile, made him at once hero and historian, endowed him with\nthe romantic privilege of the “first person”—the darkest abyss of\nromance this, inveterately, when enjoyed on the grand scale—variety,\nand many other queer matters as well, might have been smuggled in by a\nback door. Suffice it, to be brief, that the first person, in the long\npiece, is a form foredoomed to looseness and that looseness, never much\nmy affair, had never been so little so as on this particular occasion.\nAll of which reflexions flocked to the standard from the moment—a very\nearly one—the question of how to keep my form amusing while sticking so\nclose to my central figure and constantly taking its pattern from him\nhad to be faced. He arrives (arrives at Chester) as for the dreadful\npurpose of giving his creator “no end” to tell about him—before which\nrigorous mission the serenest of creators might well have quailed. I\nwas far from the serenest; I was more than agitated enough to reflect\nthat, grimly deprived of one alternative or one substitute for\n“telling,” I must address myself tooth and nail to another. I couldn’t,\nsave by implication, make other persons tell _each other_ about\nhim—blest resource, blest necessity, of the drama, which reaches its\neffects of unity, all remarkably, by paths absolutely opposite to the\npaths of the novel: with other persons, save as they were primarily\n_his_ persons (not he primarily but one of theirs), I had simply\nnothing to do. I had relations for him none the less, by the mercy of\nProvidence, quite as much as if my exhibition was to be a muddle; if I\ncould only by implication and a show of consequence make other persons\ntell each other about him, I could at least make him tell _them_\nwhatever in the world he must; and could so, by the same token—which\nwas a further luxury thrown in—see straight into the deep differences\nbetween what that could do for me, or at all events for _him_, and the\nlarge ease of “autobiography.” It may be asked why, if one so keeps to\none’s hero, one shouldn’t make a single mouthful of “method,” shouldn’t\nthrow the reins on his neck and, letting them flap there as free as in\n“Gil Blas” or in “David Copperfield,” equip him with the double\nprivilege of subject and object—a course that has at least the merit of\nbrushing away questions at a sweep. The answer to which is, I think,\nthat one makes that surrender only if one is prepared _not_ to make\ncertain precious discriminations.\n\nThe “first person” then, so employed, is addressed by the author\ndirectly to ourselves, his possible readers, whom he has to reckon\nwith, at the best, by our English tradition, so loosely and vaguely\nafter all, so little respectfully, on so scant a presumption of\nexposure to criticism. Strether, on the other hand, encaged and\nprovided for as “The Ambassadors” encages and provides, has to keep in\nview proprieties much stiffer and more salutary than any our straight\nand credulous gape are likely to bring home to him, has exhibitional\nconditions to meet, in a word, that forbid the terrible _fluidity_ of\nself-revelation. I may seem not to better the case for my\ndiscrimination if I say that, for my first care, I had thus inevitably\nto set him up a confidant or two, to wave away with energy the custom\nof the seated mass of explanation after the fact, the inserted block of\nmerely referential narrative, which flourishes so, to the shame of the\nmodern impatience, on the serried page of Balzac, but which seems\nsimply to appal our actual, our general weaker, digestion. “Harking\nback to make up” took at any rate more doing, as the phrase is, not\nonly than the reader of to-day demands, but than he will tolerate at\nany price any call upon him either to understand or remotely to\nmeasure; and for the beauty of the thing when done the current\neditorial mind in particular appears wholly without sense. It is not,\nhowever, primarily for either of these reasons, whatever their weight,\nthat Strether’s friend Waymarsh is so keenly clutched at, on the\nthreshold of the book, or that no less a pounce is made on Maria\nGostrey—without even the pretext, either, of _her_ being, in essence,\nStrether’s friend. She is the reader’s friend much rather—in\nconsequence of dispositions that make him so eminently require one; and\nshe acts in that capacity, and _really_ in that capacity alone, with\nexemplary devotion from beginning to and of the book. She is an\nenrolled, a direct, aid to lucidity; she is in fine, to tear off her\nmask, the most unmitigated and abandoned of _ficelles_. Half the\ndramatist’s art, as we well know—since if we don’t it’s not the fault\nof the proofs that lie scattered about us—is in the use of _ficelles_;\nby which I mean in a deep dissimulation of his dependence on them.\nWaymarsh only to a slighter degree belongs, in the whole business, less\nto my subject than to my treatment of it; the interesting proof, in\nthese connexions, being that one has but to take one’s subject for the\nstuff of drama to interweave with enthusiasm as many Gostreys as need\nbe.\n\nThe material of “The Ambassadors,” conforming in this respect exactly\nto that of “The Wings of the Dove,” published just before it, is taken\nabsolutely for the stuff of drama; so that, availing myself of the\nopportunity given me by this edition for some prefatory remarks on the\nlatter work, I had mainly to make on its behalf the point of its scenic\nconsistency. It disguises that virtue, in the oddest way in the world,\nby just _looking_, as we turn its pages, as little scenic as possible;\nbut it sharply divides itself, just as the composition before us does,\ninto the parts that prepare, that tend in fact to over-prepare, for\nscenes, and the parts, or otherwise into the scenes, that justify and\ncrown the preparation. It may definitely be said, I think, that\neverything in it that is not scene (not, I of course mean, complete and\nfunctional scene, treating _all_ the submitted matter, as by logical\nstart, logical turn, and logical finish) is discriminated preparation,\nis the fusion and synthesis of picture. These alternations propose\nthemselves all recogniseably, I think, from an early stage, as the very\nform and figure of “The Ambassadors”; so that, to repeat, such an agent\nas Miss Gostrey pre-engaged at a high salary, but waits in the draughty\nwing with her shawl and her smelling-salts. Her function speaks at once\nfor itself, and by the time she has dined with Strether in London and\ngone to a play with him her intervention as a _ficelle_ is, I hold,\nexpertly justified. Thanks to it we have treated scenically, and\nscenically alone, the whole lumpish question of Strether’s “past,”\nwhich has seen us more happily on the way than anything else could have\ndone; we have strained to a high lucidity and vivacity (or at least we\nhope we have) certain indispensable facts; we have seen our two or\nthree immediate friends all conveniently and profitably in “action”; to\nsay nothing of our beginning to descry others, of a remoter intensity,\ngetting into motion, even if a bit vaguely as yet, for our further\nenrichment. Let my first point be here that the scene in question, that\nin which the whole situation at Woollett and the complex forces that\nhave propelled my hero to where this lively extractor of his value and\ndistiller of his essence awaits him, is normal and entire, is really an\nexcellent _standard_ scene; copious, comprehensive, and accordingly\nnever short, but with its office as definite as that of the hammer on\nthe gong of the clock, the office of expressing _all that is in_ the\nhour.\n\nThe “_ficelle_” character of the subordinate party is as artfully\ndissimulated, throughout, as may be, and to that extent that, with the\nseams or joints of Maria Gostrey’s ostensible connectedness taken\nparticular care of, duly smoothed over, that is, and anxiously kept\nfrom showing as “pieced on,” this figure doubtless achieves, after a\nfashion, something of the dignity of a prime idea: which circumstance\nbut shows us afresh how many quite incalculable but none the less clear\nsources of enjoyment for the infatuated artist, how many copious\nsprings of our never-to-be-slighted “fun” for the reader and critic\nsusceptible of contagion, may sound their incidental plash as soon as\nan artistic process begins to enjoy free development. Exquisite—in\nillustration of this—the mere interest and amusement of such at once\n“creative” and critical questions as how and where and why to make Miss\nGostrey’s false connexion carry itself, under a due high polish, as a\nreal one. Nowhere is it more of an artful expedient for mere\nconsistency of form, to mention a case, than in the last “scene” of the\nbook, where its function is to give or to add nothing whatever, but\nonly to express as vividly as possible certain things quite other than\nitself and that are of the already fixed and appointed measure. Since,\nhowever, all art is _expression_, and is thereby vividness, one was to\nfind the door open here to any amount of delightful dissimulation.\nThese verily are the refinements and ecstasies of method—amid which, or\ncertainly under the influence of any exhilarated demonstration of\nwhich, one must keep one’s head and not lose one’s way. To cultivate an\nadequate intelligence for them and to make that sense operative is\npositively to find a charm in any produced ambiguity of appearance that\nis not by the same stroke, and all helplessly, an ambiguity of sense.\nTo project imaginatively, for my hero, a relation that has nothing to\ndo with the matter (the matter of my subject) but has everything to do\nwith the manner (the manner of my presentation of the same) and yet to\ntreat it, at close quarters and for fully economic expression’s\npossible sake, as if it were important and essential—to do that sort of\nthing and yet muddle nothing may easily become, as one goes, a signally\nattaching proposition; even though it all remains but part and parcel,\nI hasten to recognise, of the merely general and related question of\nexpressional curiosity and expressional decency.\n\nI am moved to add after so much insistence on the scenic side of my\nlabour that I have found the steps of re-perusal almost as much waylaid\nhere by quite another style of effort in the same signal interest—or\nhave in other words not failed to note how, even so associated and so\ndiscriminated, the finest proprieties and charms of the non-scenic may,\nunder the right hand for them, still keep their intelligibility and\nassert their office. Infinitely suggestive such an observation as this\nlast on the whole delightful head, where representation is concerned,\nof possible variety, of effective expressional change and contrast. One\nwould like, at such an hour as this, for critical licence, to go into\nthe matter of the noted inevitable deviation (from too fond an original\nvision) that the exquisite treachery even of the straightest execution\nmay ever be trusted to inflict even on the most mature plan—the case\nbeing that, though one’s last reconsidered production always seems to\nbristle with that particular evidence, “The Ambassadors” would place a\nflood of such light at my service. I must attach to my final remark\nhere a different import; noting in the other connexion I just glanced\nat that such passages as that of my hero’s first encounter with Chad\nNewsome, absolute attestations of the non-scenic form though they be,\nyet lay the firmest hand too—so far at least as intention goes—on\nrepresentational effect. To report at all closely and completely of\nwhat “passes” on a given occasion is inevitably to become more or less\nscenic; and yet in the instance I allude to, _with_ the conveyance,\nexpressional curiosity and expressional decency are sought and arrived\nat under quite another law. The true inwardness of this may be at\nbottom but that one of the suffered treacheries has consisted\nprecisely, for Chad’s whole figure and presence, of a direct\npresentability diminished and compromised—despoiled, that is, of its\n_proportional_ advantage; so that, in a word, the whole economy of his\nauthor’s relation to him has at important points to be redetermined.\nThe book, however, critically viewed, is touchingly full of these\ndisguised and repaired losses, these insidious recoveries, these\nintensely redemptive consistencies. The pages in which Mamie Pocock\ngives her appointed and, I can’t but think, duly felt lift to the whole\naction by the so inscrutably-applied side-stroke or short-cut of our\njust watching and as quite at an angle of vision as yet untried, her\nsingle hour of suspense in the hotel salon, in our partaking of her\nconcentrated study of the sense of matters bearing on her own case, all\nthe bright warm Paris afternoon, from the balcony that overlooks the\nTuileries garden—these are as marked an example of the representational\nvirtue that insists here and there on being, for the charm of\nopposition and renewal, other than the scenic. It wouldn’t take much to\nmake me further argue that from an equal play of such oppositions the\nbook gathers an intensity that fairly adds to the dramatic—though the\nlatter is supposed to be the sum of all intensities; or that has at any\nrate nothing to fear from juxtaposition with it. I consciously fail to\nshrink in fact from that extravagance—I risk it rather, for the sake of\nthe moral involved; which is not that the particular production before\nus exhausts the interesting questions it raises, but that the Novel\nremains still, under the right persuasion, the most independent, most\nelastic, most prodigious of literary forms.\n\n\n HENRY JAMES.\n\n\n\nBook First\n\n I\n\nStrether’s first question, when he reached the hotel, was about his\nfriend; yet on his learning that Waymarsh was apparently not to arrive\ntill evening he was not wholly disconcerted. A telegram from him\nbespeaking a room “only if not noisy,” reply paid, was produced for the\nenquirer at the office, so that the understanding they should meet at\nChester rather than at Liverpool remained to that extent sound. The\nsame secret principle, however, that had prompted Strether not\nabsolutely to desire Waymarsh’s presence at the dock, that had led him\nthus to postpone for a few hours his enjoyment of it, now operated to\nmake him feel he could still wait without disappointment. They would\ndine together at the worst, and, with all respect to dear old\nWaymarsh—if not even, for that matter, to himself—there was little fear\nthat in the sequel they shouldn’t see enough of each other. The\nprinciple I have just mentioned as operating had been, with the most\nnewly disembarked of the two men, wholly instinctive—the fruit of a\nsharp sense that, delightful as it would be to find himself looking,\nafter so much separation, into his comrade’s face, his business would\nbe a trifle bungled should he simply arrange for this countenance to\npresent itself to the nearing steamer as the first “note,” of Europe.\nMixed with everything was the apprehension, already, on Strether’s\npart, that it would, at best, throughout, prove the note of Europe in\nquite a sufficient degree.\n\nThat note had been meanwhile—since the previous afternoon, thanks to\nthis happier device—such a consciousness of personal freedom as he\nhadn’t known for years; such a deep taste of change and of having above\nall for the moment nobody and nothing to consider, as promised already,\nif headlong hope were not too foolish, to colour his adventure with\ncool success. There were people on the ship with whom he had easily\nconsorted—so far as ease could up to now be imputed to him—and who for\nthe most part plunged straight into the current that set from the\nlanding-stage to London; there were others who had invited him to a\ntryst at the inn and had even invoked his aid for a “look round” at the\nbeauties of Liverpool; but he had stolen away from every one alike, had\nkept no appointment and renewed no acquaintance, had been indifferently\naware of the number of persons who esteemed themselves fortunate in\nbeing, unlike himself, “met,” and had even independently, unsociably,\nalone, without encounter or relapse and by mere quiet evasion, given\nhis afternoon and evening to the immediate and the sensible. They\nformed a qualified draught of Europe, an afternoon and an evening on\nthe banks of the Mersey, but such as it was he took his potion at least\nundiluted. He winced a little, truly, at the thought that Waymarsh\nmight be already at Chester; he reflected that, should he have to\ndescribe himself there as having “got in” so early, it would be\ndifficult to make the interval look particularly eager; but he was like\na man who, elatedly finding in his pocket more money than usual,\nhandles it a while and idly and pleasantly chinks it before addressing\nhimself to the business of spending. That he was prepared to be vague\nto Waymarsh about the hour of the ship’s touching, and that he both\nwanted extremely to see him and enjoyed extremely the duration of\ndelay—these things, it is to be conceived, were early signs in him that\nhis relation to his actual errand might prove none of the simplest. He\nwas burdened, poor Strether—it had better be confessed at the\noutset—with the oddity of a double consciousness. There was detachment\nin his zeal and curiosity in his indifference.\n\nAfter the young woman in the glass cage had held up to him across her\ncounter the pale-pink leaflet bearing his friend’s name, which she\nneatly pronounced, he turned away to find himself, in the hall, facing\na lady who met his eyes as with an intention suddenly determined, and\nwhose features—not freshly young, not markedly fine, but on happy terms\nwith each other—came back to him as from a recent vision. For a moment\nthey stood confronted; then the moment placed her: he had noticed her\nthe day before, noticed her at his previous inn, where—again in the\nhall—she had been briefly engaged with some people of his own ship’s\ncompany. Nothing had actually passed between them, and he would as\nlittle have been able to say what had been the sign of her face for him\non the first occasion as to name the ground of his present recognition.\nRecognition at any rate appeared to prevail on her own side as\nwell—which would only have added to the mystery. All she now began by\nsaying to him nevertheless was that, having chanced to catch his\nenquiry, she was moved to ask, by his leave, if it were possibly a\nquestion of Mr. Waymarsh of Milrose Connecticut—Mr. Waymarsh the\nAmerican lawyer.\n\n“Oh yes,” he replied, “my very well-known friend. He’s to meet me here,\ncoming up from Malvern, and I supposed he’d already have arrived. But\nhe doesn’t come till later, and I’m relieved not to have kept him. Do\nyou know him?” Strether wound up.\n\nIt wasn’t till after he had spoken that he became aware of how much\nthere had been in him of response; when the tone of her own rejoinder,\nas well as the play of something more in her face—something more, that\nis, than its apparently usual restless light—seemed to notify him.\n“I’ve met him at Milrose—where I used sometimes, a good while ago, to\nstay; I had friends there who were friends of his, and I’ve been at his\nhouse. I won’t answer for it that he would know me,” Strether’s new\nacquaintance pursued; “but I should be delighted to see him. Perhaps,”\nshe added, “I shall—for I’m staying over.” She paused while our friend\ntook in these things, and it was as if a good deal of talk had already\npassed. They even vaguely smiled at it, and Strether presently observed\nthat Mr. Waymarsh would, no doubt, be easily to be seen. This, however,\nappeared to affect the lady as if she might have advanced too far. She\nappeared to have no reserves about anything. “Oh,” she said, “he won’t\ncare!”—and she immediately thereupon remarked that she believed\nStrether knew the Munsters; the Munsters being the people he had seen\nher with at Liverpool.\n\nBut he didn’t, it happened, know the Munsters well enough to give the\ncase much of a lift; so that they were left together as if over the\nmere laid table of conversation. Her qualification of the mentioned\nconnexion had rather removed than placed a dish, and there seemed\nnothing else to serve. Their attitude remained, none the less, that of\nnot forsaking the board; and the effect of this in turn was to give\nthem the appearance of having accepted each other with an absence of\npreliminaries practically complete. They moved along the hall together,\nand Strether’s companion threw off that the hotel had the advantage of\na garden. He was aware by this time of his strange inconsequence: he\nhad shirked the intimacies of the steamer and had muffled the shock of\nWaymarsh only to find himself forsaken, in this sudden case, both of\navoidance and of caution. He passed, under this unsought protection and\nbefore he had so much as gone up to his room, into the garden of the\nhotel, and at the end of ten minutes had agreed to meet there again, as\nsoon as he should have made himself tidy, the dispenser of such good\nassurances. He wanted to look at the town, and they would forthwith\nlook together. It was almost as if she had been in possession and\nreceived him as a guest. Her acquaintance with the place presented her\nin a manner as a hostess, and Strether had a rueful glance for the lady\nin the glass cage. It was as if this personage had seen herself\ninstantly superseded.\n\nWhen in a quarter of an hour he came down, what his hostess saw, what\nshe might have taken in with a vision kindly adjusted, was the lean,\nthe slightly loose figure of a man of the middle height and something\nmore perhaps than the middle age—a man of five-and-fifty, whose most\nimmediate signs were a marked bloodless brownness of face, a thick dark\nmoustache, of characteristically American cut, growing strong and\nfalling low, a head of hair still abundant but irregularly streaked\nwith grey, and a nose of bold free prominence, the even line, the high\nfinish, as it might have been called, of which, had a certain effect of\nmitigation. A perpetual pair of glasses astride of this fine ridge, and\na line, unusually deep and drawn, the prolonged pen-stroke of time,\naccompanying the curve of the moustache from nostril to chin, did\nsomething to complete the facial furniture that an attentive observer\nwould have seen catalogued, on the spot, in the vision of the other\nparty to Strether’s appointment. She waited for him in the garden, the\nother party, drawing on a pair of singularly fresh soft and elastic\nlight gloves and presenting herself with a superficial readiness which,\nas he approached her over the small smooth lawn and in the watery\nEnglish sunshine, he might, with his rougher preparation, have marked\nas the model for such an occasion. She had, this lady, a perfect plain\npropriety, an expensive subdued suitability, that her companion was not\nfree to analyse, but that struck him, so that his consciousness of it\nwas instantly acute, as a quality quite new to him. Before reaching her\nhe stopped on the grass and went through the form of feeling for\nsomething, possibly forgotten, in the light overcoat he carried on his\narm; yet the essence of the act was no more than the impulse to gain\ntime. Nothing could have been odder than Strether’s sense of himself as\nat that moment launched in something of which the sense would be quite\ndisconnected from the sense of his past and which was literally\nbeginning there and then. It had begun in fact already upstairs and\nbefore the dressing glass that struck him as blocking further, so\nstrangely, the dimness of the window of his dull bedroom; begun with a\nsharper survey of the elements of Appearance than he had for a long\ntime been moved to make. He had during those moments felt these\nelements to be not so much to his hand as he should have liked, and\nthen had fallen back on the thought that they were precisely a matter\nas to which help was supposed to come from what he was about to do. He\nwas about to go up to London, so that hat and necktie might wait. What\nhad come as straight to him as a ball in a well-played game—and caught\nmoreover not less neatly—was just the air, in the person of his friend,\nof having seen and chosen, the air of achieved possession of those\nvague qualities and quantities that collectively figured to him as the\nadvantage snatched from lucky chances. Without pomp or circumstance,\ncertainly, as her original address to him, equally with his own\nresponse, had been, he would have sketched to himself his impression of\nher as: “Well, she’s more thoroughly civilized—!” If “More thoroughly\nthan _whom?_” would not have been for him a sequel to this remark, that\nwas just by reason of his deep consciousness of the bearing of his\ncomparison.\n\nThe amusement, at all events, of a civilisation intenser was\nwhat—familiar compatriot as she was, with the full tone of the\ncompatriot and the rattling link not with mystery but only with dear\ndyspeptic Waymarsh—she appeared distinctly to promise. His pause while\nhe felt in his overcoat was positively the pause of confidence, and it\nenabled his eyes to make out as much of a case for her, in proportion,\nas her own made out for himself. She affected him as almost insolently\nyoung; but an easily carried five-and-thirty could still do that. She\nwas, however, like himself marked and wan; only it naturally couldn’t\nhave been known to him how much a spectator looking from one to the\nother might have discerned that they had in common. It wouldn’t for\nsuch a spectator have been altogether insupposable that, each so finely\nbrown and so sharply spare, each confessing so to dents of surface and\naids to sight, to a disproportionate nose and a head delicately or\ngrossly grizzled, they might have been brother and sister. On this\nground indeed there would have been a residuum of difference; such a\nsister having surely known in respect to such a brother the extremity\nof separation, and such a brother now feeling in respect to such a\nsister the extremity of surprise. Surprise, it was true, was not on the\nother hand what the eyes of Strether’s friend most showed him while she\ngave him, stroking her gloves smoother, the time he appreciated. They\nhad taken hold of him straightway measuring him up and down as if they\nknew how; as if he were human material they had already in some sort\nhandled. Their possessor was in truth, it may be communicated, the\nmistress of a hundred cases or categories, receptacles of the mind,\nsubdivisions for convenience, in which, from a full experience, she\npigeon-holed her fellow mortals with a hand as free as that of a\ncompositor scattering type. She was as equipped in this particular as\nStrether was the reverse, and it made an opposition between them which\nhe might well have shrunk from submitting to if he had fully suspected\nit. So far as he did suspect it he was on the contrary, after a short\nshake of his consciousness, as pleasantly passive as might be. He\nreally had a sort of sense of what she knew. He had quite the sense\nthat she knew things he didn’t, and though this was a concession that\nin general he found not easy to make to women, he made it now as\ngood-humouredly as if it lifted a burden. His eyes were so quiet behind\nhis eternal nippers that they might almost have been absent without\nchanging his face, which took its expression mainly, and not least its\nstamp of sensibility, from other sources, surface and grain and form.\nHe joined his guide in an instant, and then felt she had profited still\nbetter than he by his having been for the moments just mentioned, so at\nthe disposal of her intelligence. She knew even intimate things about\nhim that he hadn’t yet told her and perhaps never would. He wasn’t\nunaware that he had told her rather remarkably many for the time, but\nthese were not the real ones. Some of the real ones, however,\nprecisely, were what she knew.\n\nThey were to pass again through the hall of the inn to get into the\nstreet, and it was here she presently checked him with a question.\n“Have you looked up my name?”\n\nHe could only stop with a laugh. “Have you looked up mine?”\n\n“Oh dear, yes—as soon as you left me. I went to the office and asked.\nHadn’t _you_ better do the same?”\n\nHe wondered. “Find out who you are?—after the uplifted young woman\nthere has seen us thus scrape acquaintance!”\n\nShe laughed on her side now at the shade of alarm in his amusement.\n“Isn’t it a reason the more? If what you’re afraid of is the injury for\nme—my being seen to walk off with a gentleman who has to ask who I am—I\nassure you I don’t in the least mind. Here, however,” she continued,\n“is my card, and as I find there’s something else again I have to say\nat the office, you can just study it during the moment I leave you.”\n\nShe left him after he had taken from her the small pasteboard she had\nextracted from her pocket-book, and he had extracted another from his\nown, to exchange with it, before she came back. He read thus the simple\ndesignation “Maria Gostrey,” to which was attached, in a corner of the\ncard, with a number, the name of a street, presumably in Paris, without\nother appreciable identity than its foreignness. He put the card into\nhis waistcoat pocket, keeping his own meanwhile in evidence; and as he\nleaned against the door-post he met with the smile of a straying\nthought what the expanse before the hotel offered to his view. It was\npositively droll to him that he should already have Maria Gostrey,\nwhoever she was—of which he hadn’t really the least idea—in a place of\nsafe keeping. He had somehow an assurance that he should carefully\npreserve the little token he had just tucked in. He gazed with unseeing\nlingering eyes as he followed some of the implications of his act,\nasking himself if he really felt admonished to qualify it as disloyal.\nIt was prompt, it was possibly even premature, and there was little\ndoubt of the expression of face the sight of it would have produced in\na certain person. But if it was “wrong”—why then he had better not have\ncome out at all. At this, poor man, had he already—and even before\nmeeting Waymarsh—arrived. He had believed he had a limit, but the limit\nhad been transcended within thirty-six hours. By how long a space on\nthe plane of manners or even of morals, moreover, he felt still more\nsharply after Maria Gostrey had come back to him and with a gay\ndecisive “So now—!” led him forth into the world. This counted, it\nstruck him as he walked beside her with his overcoat on an arm, his\numbrella under another and his personal pasteboard a little stiffly\nretained between forefinger and thumb, this struck him as really, in\ncomparison his introduction to things. It hadn’t been “Europe” at\nLiverpool no—not even in the dreadful delightful impressive streets the\nnight before—to the extent his present companion made it so. She hadn’t\nyet done that so much as when, after their walk had lasted a few\nminutes and he had had time to wonder if a couple of sidelong glances\nfrom her meant that he had best have put on gloves she almost pulled\nhim up with an amused challenge. “But why—fondly as it’s so easy to\nimagine your clinging to it—don’t you put it away? Or if it’s an\ninconvenience to you to carry it, one’s often glad to have one’s card\nback. The fortune one spends in them!”\n\nThen he saw both that his way of marching with his own prepared tribute\nhad affected her as a deviation in one of those directions he couldn’t\nyet measure, and that she supposed this emblem to be still the one he\nhad received from her. He accordingly handed her the card as if in\nrestitution, but as soon as she had it she felt the difference and,\nwith her eyes on it, stopped short for apology. “I like,” she observed,\n“your name.”\n\n“Oh,” he answered, “you won’t have heard of it!” Yet he had his reasons\nfor not being sure but that she perhaps might.\n\nAh it was but too visible! She read it over again as one who had never\nseen it. “‘Mr. Lewis Lambert Strether’”—she sounded it almost as freely\nas for any stranger. She repeated however that she liked\nit—“particularly the Lewis Lambert. It’s the name of a novel of\nBalzac’s.”\n\n“Oh I know that!” said Strether.\n\n“But the novel’s an awfully bad one.”\n\n“I know that too,” Strether smiled. To which he added with an\nirrelevance that was only superficial: “I come from Woollett\nMassachusetts.” It made her for some reason—the irrelevance or\nwhatever—laugh. Balzac had described many cities, but hadn’t described\nWoollett Massachusetts. “You say that,” she returned, “as if you wanted\none immediately to know the worst.”\n\n“Oh I think it’s a thing,” he said, “that you must already have made\nout. I feel it so that I certainly must look it, speak it, and, as\npeople say there, ‘act’ it. It sticks out of me, and you knew surely\nfor yourself as soon as you looked at me.”\n\n“The worst, you mean?”\n\n“Well, the fact of where I come from. There at any rate it _is_; so\nthat you won’t be able, if anything happens, to say I’ve not been\nstraight with you.”\n\n“I see”—and Miss Gostrey looked really interested in the point he had\nmade. “But what do you think of as happening?”\n\nThough he wasn’t shy—which was rather anomalous—Strether gazed about\nwithout meeting her eyes; a motion that was frequent with him in talk,\nyet of which his words often seemed not at all the effect. “Why that\nyou should find me too hopeless.” With which they walked on again\ntogether while she answered, as they went, that the most “hopeless” of\nher countryfolk were in general precisely those she liked best. All\nsorts of other pleasant small things—small things that were yet large\nfor him—flowered in the air of the occasion, but the bearing of the\noccasion itself on matters still remote concerns us too closely to\npermit us to multiply our illustrations. Two or three, however, in\ntruth, we should perhaps regret to lose. The tortuous wall—girdle, long\nsince snapped, of the little swollen city, half held in place by\ncareful civic hands—wanders in narrow file between parapets smoothed by\npeaceful generations, pausing here and there for a dismantled gate or a\nbridged gap, with rises and drops, steps up and steps down, queer\ntwists, queer contacts, peeps into homely streets and under the brows\nof gables, views of cathedral tower and waterside fields, of huddled\nEnglish town and ordered English country. Too deep almost for words was\nthe delight of these things to Strether; yet as deeply mixed with it\nwere certain images of his inward picture. He had trod this walks in\nthe far-off time, at twenty-five; but that, instead of spoiling it,\nonly enriched it for present feeling and marked his renewal as a thing\nsubstantial enough to share. It was with Waymarsh he should have shared\nit, and he was now accordingly taking from him something that was his\ndue. He looked repeatedly at his watch, and when he had done so for the\nfifth time Miss Gostrey took him up.\n\n“You’re doing something that you think not right.”\n\nIt so touched the place that he quite changed colour and his laugh grew\nalmost awkward. “Am I enjoying it as much as _that?_”\n\n“You’re not enjoying it, I think, so much as you ought.”\n\n“I see”—he appeared thoughtfully to agree. “Great is my privilege.”\n\n“Oh it’s not your privilege! It has nothing to do with _me_. It has to\ndo with yourself. Your failure’s general.”\n\n“Ah there you are!” he laughed. “It’s the failure of Woollett. _That’s_\ngeneral.”\n\n“The failure to enjoy,” Miss Gostrey explained, “is what I mean.”\n\n“Precisely. Woollett isn’t sure it ought to enjoy. If it were it would.\nBut it hasn’t, poor thing,” Strether continued, “any one to show it\nhow. It’s not like me. I have somebody.”\n\nThey had stopped, in the afternoon sunshine—constantly pausing, in\ntheir stroll, for the sharper sense of what they saw—and Strether\nrested on one of the high sides of the old stony groove of the little\nrampart. He leaned back on this support with his face to the tower of\nthe cathedral, now admirably commanded by their station, the high\nred-brown mass, square and subordinately spired and crocketed,\nretouched and restored, but charming to his long-sealed eyes and with\nthe first swallows of the year weaving their flight all round it. Miss\nGostrey lingered near him, full of an air, to which she more and more\njustified her right, of understanding the effect of things. She quite\nconcurred. “You’ve indeed somebody.” And she added: “I wish you _would_\nlet me show you how!”\n\n“Oh I’m afraid of you!” he cheerfully pleaded.\n\nShe kept on him a moment, through her glasses and through his own, a\ncertain pleasant pointedness. “Ah no, you’re not! You’re not in the\nleast, thank goodness! If you had been we shouldn’t so soon have found\nourselves here together. I think,” she comfortably concluded, “you\ntrust me.”\n\n“I think I do!—but that’s exactly what I’m afraid of. I shouldn’t mind\nif I didn’t. It’s falling thus in twenty minutes so utterly into your\nhands. I dare say,” Strether continued, “it’s a sort of thing you’re\nthoroughly familiar with; but nothing more extraordinary has ever\nhappened to me.”\n\nShe watched him with all her kindness. “That means simply that you’ve\nrecognised me—which _is_ rather beautiful and rare. You see what I am.”\nAs on this, however, he protested, with a good-humoured headshake, a\nresignation of any such claim, she had a moment of explanation. “If\nyou’ll only come on further as you _have_ come you’ll at any rate make\nout. My own fate has been too many for me, and I’ve succumbed to it.\nI’m a general guide—to ‘Europe,’ don’t you know? I wait for people—I\nput them through. I pick them up—I set them down. I’m a sort of\nsuperior ‘courier-maid.’ I’m a companion at large. I take people, as\nI’ve told you, about. I never sought it—it has come to me. It has been\nmy fate, and one’s fate one accepts. It’s a dreadful thing to have to\nsay, in so wicked a world, but I verily believe that, such as you see\nme, there’s nothing I don’t know. I know all the shops and the\nprices—but I know worse things still. I bear on my back the huge load\nof our national consciousness, or, in other words—for it comes to\nthat—of our nation itself. Of what is our nation composed but of the\nmen and women individually on my shoulders? I don’t do it, you know,\nfor any particular advantage. I don’t do it, for instance—some people\ndo, you know—for money.”\n\nStrether could only listen and wonder and weigh his chance. “And yet,\naffected as you are then to so many of your clients, you can scarcely\nbe said to do it for love.” He waited a moment. “How do we reward you?”\n\nShe had her own hesitation, but “You don’t!” she finally returned,\nsetting him again in motion. They went on, but in a few minutes, though\nwhile still thinking over what she had said, he once more took out his\nwatch; mechanically, unconsciously and as if made nervous by the mere\nexhilaration of what struck him as her strange and cynical wit. He\nlooked at the hour without seeing it, and then, on something again said\nby his companion, had another pause. “You’re really in terror of him.”\n\nHe smiled a smile that he almost felt to be sickly. “Now you can see\nwhy I’m afraid of you.”\n\n“Because I’ve such illuminations? Why they’re all for your help! It’s\nwhat I told you,” she added, “just now. You feel as if this were\nwrong.”\n\nHe fell back once more, settling himself against the parapet as if to\nhear more about it. “Then get me out!”\n\nHer face fairly brightened for the joy of the appeal, but, as if it\nwere a question of immediate action, she visibly considered. “Out of\nwaiting for him?—of seeing him at all?”\n\n“Oh no—not that,” said poor Strether, looking grave. “I’ve got to wait\nfor him—and I want very much to see him. But out of the terror. You did\nput your finger on it a few minutes ago. It’s general, but it avails\nitself of particular occasions. That’s what it’s doing for me now. I’m\nalways considering something else; something else, I mean, than the\nthing of the moment. The obsession of the other thing is the terror.\nI’m considering at present for instance something else than _you_.”\n\nShe listened with charming earnestness. “Oh you oughtn’t to do that!”\n\n“It’s what I admit. Make it then impossible.”\n\nShe continued to think. “Is it really an ‘order’ from you?—that I shall\ntake the job? _Will_ you give yourself up?”\n\nPoor Strether heaved his sigh. “If I only could! But that’s the deuce\nof it—that I never can. No—I can’t.”\n\nShe wasn’t, however, discouraged. “But you want to at least?”\n\n“Oh unspeakably!”\n\n“Ah then, if you’ll try!”—and she took over the job, as she had called\nit, on the spot. “Trust me!” she exclaimed, and the action of this, as\nthey retraced their steps, was presently to make him pass his hand into\nher arm in the manner of a benign dependent paternal old person who\nwishes to be “nice” to a younger one. If he drew it out again indeed as\nthey approached the inn this may have been because, after more talk had\npassed between them, the relation of age, or at least of\nexperience—which, for that matter, had already played to and fro with\nsome freedom—affected him as incurring a readjustment. It was at all\nevents perhaps lucky that they arrived in sufficiently separate fashion\nwithin range of the hotel-door. The young lady they had left in the\nglass cage watched as if she had come to await them on the threshold.\nAt her side stood a person equally interested, by his attitude, in\ntheir return, and the effect of the sight of whom was instantly to\ndetermine for Strether another of those responsive arrests that we have\nhad so repeatedly to note. He left it to Miss Gostrey to name, with the\nfine full bravado as it almost struck him, of her “Mr. Waymarsh!” what\nwas to have been, what—he more than ever felt as his short stare of\nsuspended welcome took things in—would have been, but for herself, his\ndoom. It was already upon him even at that distance—Mr. Waymarsh was\nfor _his_ part joyless.\n\n\n II\n\nHe had none the less to confess to this friend that evening that he\nknew almost nothing about her, and it was a deficiency that Waymarsh,\neven with his memory refreshed by contact, by her own prompt and lucid\nallusions and enquiries, by their having publicly partaken of dinner in\nher company, and by another stroll, to which she was not a stranger,\nout into the town to look at the cathedral by moonlight—it was a blank\nthat the resident of Milrose, though admitting acquaintance with the\nMunsters, professed himself unable to fill. He had no recollection of\nMiss Gostrey, and two or three questions that she put to him about\nthose members of his circle had, to Strether’s observation, the same\neffect he himself had already more directly felt—the effect of\nappearing to place all knowledge, for the time, on this original\nwoman’s side. It interested him indeed to mark the limits of any such\nrelation for her with his friend as there could possibly be a question\nof, and it particularly struck him that they were to be marked\naltogether in Waymarsh’s quarter. This added to his own sense of having\ngone far with her—gave him an early illustration of a much shorter\ncourse. There was a certitude he immediately grasped—a conviction that\nWaymarsh would quite fail, as it were, and on whatever degree of\nacquaintances to profit by her.\n\nThere had been after the first interchange among the three a talk of\nsome five minutes in the hall, and then the two men had adjourned to\nthe garden, Miss Gostrey for the time disappearing. Strether in due\ncourse accompanied his friend to the room he had bespoken and had,\nbefore going out, scrupulously visited; where at the end of another\nhalf-hour he had no less discreetly left him. On leaving him he\nrepaired straight to his own room, but with the prompt effect of\nfeeling the compass of that chamber resented by his condition. There he\nenjoyed at once the first consequence of their reunion. A place was too\nsmall for him after it that had seemed large enough before. He had\nawaited it with something he would have been sorry, have been almost\nashamed not to recognise as emotion, yet with a tacit assumption at the\nsame time that emotion would in the event find itself relieved. The\nactual oddity was that he was only more excited; and his excitement—to\nwhich indeed he would have found it difficult instantly to give a\nname—brought him once more downstairs and caused him for some minutes\nvaguely to wander. He went once more to the garden; he looked into the\npublic room, found Miss Gostrey writing letters and backed out; he\nroamed, fidgeted and wasted time; but he was to have his more intimate\nsession with his friend before the evening closed.\n\nIt was late—not till Strether had spent an hour upstairs with him—that\nthis subject consented to betake himself to doubtful rest. Dinner and\nthe subsequent stroll by moonlight—a dream, on Strether’s part, of\nromantic effects rather prosaically merged in a mere missing of thicker\ncoats—had measurably intervened, and this midnight conference was the\nresult of Waymarsh’s having (when they were free, as he put it, of\ntheir fashionable friend) found the smoking-room not quite what he\nwanted, and yet bed what he wanted less. His most frequent form of\nwords was that he knew himself, and they were applied on this occasion\nto his certainty of not sleeping. He knew himself well enough to know\nthat he should have a night of prowling unless he should succeed, as a\npreliminary, in getting prodigiously tired. If the effort directed to\nthis end involved till a late hour the presence of Strether—consisted,\nthat is, in the detention of the latter for full discourse—there was\nyet an impression of minor discipline involved for our friend in the\npicture Waymarsh made as he sat in trousers and shirt on the edge of\nhis couch. With his long legs extended and his large back much bent, he\nnursed alternately, for an almost incredible time, his elbows and his\nbeard. He struck his visitor as extremely, as almost wilfully\nuncomfortable; yet what had this been for Strether, from that first\nglimpse of him disconcerted in the porch of the hotel, but the\npredominant notes. The discomfort was in a manner contagious, as well\nas also in a manner inconsequent and unfounded; the visitor felt that\nunless he should get used to it—or unless Waymarsh himself should—it\nwould constitute a menace for his own prepared, his own already\nconfirmed, consciousness of the agreeable. On their first going up\ntogether to the room Strether had selected for him Waymarsh had looked\nit over in silence and with a sigh that represented for his companion,\nif not the habit of disapprobation, at least the despair of felicity;\nand this look had recurred to Strether as the key of much he had since\nobserved. “Europe,” he had begun to gather from these things, had up to\nnow rather failed of its message to him; he hadn’t got into tune with\nit and had at the end of three months almost renounced any such\nexpectation.\n\nHe really appeared at present to insist on that by just perching there\nwith the gas in his eyes. This of itself somehow conveyed the futility\nof single rectifications in a multiform failure. He had a large\nhandsome head and a large sallow seamed face—a striking significant\nphysiognomic total, the upper range of which, the great political brow,\nthe thick loose hair, the dark fuliginous eyes, recalled even to a\ngeneration whose standard had dreadfully deviated the impressive image,\nfamiliar by engravings and busts, of some great national worthy of the\nearlier part of the mid-century. He was of the personal type—and it was\nan element in the power and promise that in their early time Strether\nhad found in him—of the American statesman, the statesman trained in\n“Congressional halls,” of an elder day. The legend had been in later\nyears that as the lower part of his face, which was weak, and slightly\ncrooked, spoiled the likeness, this was the real reason for the growth\nof his beard, which might have seemed to spoil it for those not in the\nsecret. He shook his mane; he fixed, with his admirable eyes, his\nauditor or his observer; he wore no glasses and had a way, partly\nformidable, yet also partly encouraging, as from a representative to a\nconstituent, of looking very hard at those who approached him. He met\nyou as if you had knocked and he had bidden you enter. Strether, who\nhadn’t seen him for so long an interval, apprehended him now with a\nfreshness of taste, and had perhaps never done him such ideal justice.\nThe head was bigger, the eyes finer, than they need have been for the\ncareer; but that only meant, after all, that the career was itself\nexpressive. What it expressed at midnight in the gas-glaring bedroom at\nChester was that the subject of it had, at the end of years, barely\nescaped, by flight in time, a general nervous collapse. But this very\nproof of the full life, as the full life was understood at Milrose,\nwould have made to Strether’s imagination an element in which Waymarsh\ncould have floated easily had he only consented to float. Alas nothing\nso little resembled floating as the rigour with which, on the edge of\nhis bed, he hugged his posture of prolonged impermanence. It suggested\nto his comrade something that always, when kept up, worried him—a\nperson established in a railway-coach with a forward inclination. It\nrepresented the angle at which poor Waymarsh was to sit through the\nordeal of Europe.\n\nThanks to the stress of occupation, the strain of professions, the\nabsorption and embarrassment of each, they had not, at home, during\nyears before this sudden brief and almost bewildering reign of\ncomparative ease, found so much as a day for a meeting; a fact that was\nin some degree an explanation of the sharpness with which most of his\nfriend’s features stood out to Strether. Those he had lost sight of\nsince the early time came back to him; others that it was never\npossible to forget struck him now as sitting, clustered and expectant,\nlike a somewhat defiant family-group, on the doorstep of their\nresidence. The room was narrow for its length, and the occupant of the\nbed thrust so far a pair of slippered feet that the visitor had almost\nto step over them in his recurrent rebounds from his chair to fidget\nback and forth. There were marks the friends made on things to talk\nabout, and on things not to, and one of the latter in particular fell\nlike the tap of chalk on the blackboard. Married at thirty, Waymarsh\nhad not lived with his wife for fifteen years, and it came up vividly\nbetween them in the glare of the gas that Strether wasn’t to ask about\nher. He knew they were still separate and that she lived at hotels,\ntravelled in Europe, painted her face and wrote her husband abusive\nletters, of not one of which, to a certainty, that sufferer spared\nhimself the perusal; but he respected without difficulty the cold\ntwilight that had settled on this side of his companion’s life. It was\na province in which mystery reigned and as to which Waymarsh had never\nspoken the informing word. Strether, who wanted to do him the highest\njustice wherever he _could_ do it, singularly admired him for the\ndignity of this reserve, and even counted it as one of the\ngrounds—grounds all handled and numbered—for ranking him, in the range\nof their acquaintance, as a success. He _was_ a success, Waymarsh, in\nspite of overwork, or prostration, of sensible shrinkage, of his wife’s\nletters and of his not liking Europe. Strether would have reckoned his\nown career less futile had he been able to put into it anything so\nhandsome as so much fine silence. One might one’s self easily have left\nMrs. Waymarsh; and one would assuredly have paid one’s tribute to the\nideal in covering with that attitude the derision of having been left\nby her. Her husband had held his tongue and had made a large income;\nand these were in especial the achievements as to which Strether envied\nhim. Our friend had had indeed on his side too a subject for silence,\nwhich he fully appreciated; but it was a matter of a different sort,\nand the figure of the income he had arrived at had never been high\nenough to look any one in the face.\n\n“I don’t know as I quite see what you require it for. You don’t appear\nsick to speak of.” It was of Europe Waymarsh thus finally spoke.\n\n“Well,” said Strether, who fell as much as possible into step, “I guess\nI don’t _feel_ sick now that I’ve started. But I had pretty well run\ndown before I did start.”\n\nWaymarsh raised his melancholy look. “Ain’t you about up to your usual\naverage?”\n\nIt was not quite pointedly sceptical, but it seemed somehow a plea for\nthe purest veracity, and it thereby affected our friend as the very\nvoice of Milrose. He had long since made a mental distinction—though\nnever in truth daring to betray it—between the voice of Milrose and the\nvoice even of Woollett. It was the former he felt, that was most in the\nreal tradition. There had been occasions in his past when the sound of\nit had reduced him to temporary confusion, and the present, for some\nreason, suddenly became such another. It was nevertheless no light\nmatter that the very effect of his confusion should be to make him\nagain prevaricate. “That description hardly does justice to a man to\nwhom it has done such a lot of good to see _you_.”\n\nWaymarsh fixed on his washing-stand the silent detached stare with\nwhich Milrose in person, as it were, might have marked the\nunexpectedness of a compliment from Woollett, and Strether for his\npart, felt once more like Woollett in person. “I mean,” his friend\npresently continued, “that your appearance isn’t as bad as I’ve seen\nit: it compares favourably with what it was when I last noticed it.” On\nthis appearance Waymarsh’s eyes yet failed to rest; it was almost as if\nthey obeyed an instinct of propriety, and the effect was still stronger\nwhen, always considering the basin and jug, he added: “You’ve filled\nout some since then.”\n\n“I’m afraid I have,” Strether laughed: “one does fill out some with all\none takes in, and I’ve taken in, I dare say, more than I’ve natural\nroom for. I was dog-tired when I sailed.” It had the oddest sound of\ncheerfulness.\n\n“_I_ was dog-tired,” his companion returned, “when I arrived, and it’s\nthis wild hunt for rest that takes all the life out of me. The fact is,\nStrether—and it’s a comfort to have you here at last to say it to;\nthough I don’t know, after all, that I’ve really waited; I’ve told it\nto people I’ve met in the cars—the fact is, such a country as this\nain’t my _kind_ of country anyway. There ain’t a country I’ve seen over\nhere that _does_ seem my kind. Oh I don’t say but what there are plenty\nof pretty places and remarkable old things; but the trouble is that I\ndon’t seem to feel anywhere in tune. That’s one of the reasons why I\nsuppose I’ve gained so little. I haven’t had the first sign of that\nlift I was led to expect.” With this he broke out more earnestly. “Look\nhere—I want to go back.”\n\nHis eyes were all attached to Strether’s now, for he was one of the men\nwho fully face you when they talk of themselves. This enabled his\nfriend to look at him hard and immediately to appear to the highest\nadvantage in his eyes by doing so. “That’s a genial thing to say to a\nfellow who has come out on purpose to meet you!”\n\nNothing could have been finer, on this, than Waymarsh’s sombre glow.\n“_Have_ you come out on purpose?”\n\n“Well—very largely.”\n\n“I thought from the way you wrote there was something back of it.”\n\nStrether hesitated. “Back of my desire to be with you?”\n\n“Back of your prostration.”\n\nStrether, with a smile made more dim by a certain consciousness, shook\nhis head. “There are all the causes of it!”\n\n“And no particular cause that seemed most to drive you?”\n\nOur friend could at last conscientiously answer. “Yes. One. There _is_\na matter that has had much to do with my coming out.”\n\nWaymarsh waited a little. “Too private to mention?”\n\n“No, not too private—for _you_. Only rather complicated.”\n\n“Well,” said Waymarsh, who had waited again, “I _may_ lose my mind over\nhere, but I don’t know as I’ve done so yet.”\n\n“Oh you shall have the whole thing. But not tonight.”\n\nWaymarsh seemed to sit stiffer and to hold his elbows tighter. “Why\nnot—if I can’t sleep?”\n\n“Because, my dear man, I _can!_”\n\n“Then where’s your prostration?”\n\n“Just in that—that I can put in eight hours.” And Strether brought it\nout that if Waymarsh didn’t “gain” it was because he didn’t go to bed:\nthe result of which was, in its order, that, to do the latter justice,\nhe permitted his friend to insist on his really getting settled.\nStrether, with a kind coercive hand for it, assisted him to this\nconsummation, and again found his own part in their relation\nauspiciously enlarged by the smaller touches of lowering the lamp and\nseeing to a sufficiency of blanket. It somehow ministered for him to\nindulgence to feel Waymarsh, who looked unnaturally big and black in\nbed, as much tucked in as a patient in a hospital and, with his\ncovering up to his chin, as much simplified by it. He hovered in vague\npity, to be brief, while his companion challenged him out of the\nbedclothes. “Is she really after you? Is that what’s behind?”\n\nStrether felt an uneasiness at the direction taken by his companion’s\ninsight, but he played a little at uncertainty. “Behind my coming out?”\n\n“Behind your prostration or whatever. It’s generally felt, you know,\nthat she follows you up pretty close.”\n\nStrether’s candour was never very far off. “Oh it has occurred to you\nthat I’m literally running away from Mrs. Newsome?”\n\n“Well, I haven’t _known_ but what you are. You’re a very attractive\nman, Strether. You’ve seen for yourself,” said Waymarsh “what that lady\ndownstairs makes of it. Unless indeed,” he rambled on with an effect\nbetween the ironic and the anxious, “it’s you who are after _her_. Is\nMrs. Newsome _over_ here?” He spoke as with a droll dread of her.\n\nIt made his friend—though rather dimly—smile. “Dear no; she’s safe,\nthank goodness—as I think I more and more feel—at home. She thought of\ncoming, but she gave it up. I’ve come in a manner instead of her; and\ncome to that extent—for you’re right in your inference—on her business.\nSo you see there _is_ plenty of connexion.”\n\nWaymarsh continued to see at least all there was. “Involving\naccordingly the particular one I’ve referred to?”\n\nStrether took another turn about the room, giving a twitch to his\ncompanion’s blanket and finally gaining the door. His feeling was that\nof a nurse who had earned personal rest by having made everything\nstraight. “Involving more things than I can think of breaking ground on\nnow. But don’t be afraid—you shall have them from me: you’ll probably\nfind yourself having quite as much of them as you can do with. I\nshall—if we keep together—very much depend on your impression of some\nof them.”\n\nWaymarsh’s acknowledgement of this tribute was characteristically\nindirect. “You mean to say you don’t believe we _will_ keep together?”\n\n“I only glance at the danger,” Strether paternally said, “because when\nI hear you wail to go back I seem to see you open up such possibilities\nof folly.”\n\nWaymarsh took it—silent a little—like a large snubbed child “What are\nyou going to do with me?”\n\nIt was the very question Strether himself had put to Miss Gostrey, and\nhe wondered if he had sounded like that. But _he_ at least could be\nmore definite. “I’m going to take you right down to London.”\n\n“Oh I’ve been down to London!” Waymarsh more softly moaned. “I’ve no\nuse, Strether, for anything down there.”\n\n“Well,” said Strether, good-humouredly, “I guess you’ve some use for\n_me_.”\n\n“So I’ve got to go?”\n\n“Oh you’ve got to go further yet.”\n\n“Well,” Waymarsh sighed, “do your damnedest! Only you _will_ tell me\nbefore you lead me on all the way—?”\n\nOur friend had again so lost himself, both for amusement and for\ncontrition, in the wonder of whether he had made, in his own challenge\nthat afternoon, such another figure, that he for an instant missed the\nthread. “Tell you—?”\n\n“Why what you’ve got on hand.”\n\nStrether hesitated. “Why it’s such a matter as that even if I\npositively wanted I shouldn’t be able to keep it from you.”\n\nWaymarsh gloomily gazed. “What does that mean then but that your trip\nis just _for_ her?”\n\n“For Mrs. Newsome? Oh it certainly is, as I say. Very much.”\n\n“Then why do you also say it’s for me?”\n\nStrether, in impatience, violently played with his latch. “It’s simple\nenough. It’s for both of you.”\n\nWaymarsh at last turned over with a groan. “Well, _I_ won’t marry you!”\n\n“Neither, when it comes to that—!” But the visitor had already laughed\nand escaped.\n\n\n III\n\nHe had told Miss Gostrey he should probably take, for departure with\nWaymarsh, some afternoon train, and it thereupon in the morning\nappeared that this lady had made her own plan for an earlier one. She\nhad breakfasted when Strether came into the coffee-room; but, Waymarsh\nnot having yet emerged, he was in time to recall her to the terms of\ntheir understanding and to pronounce her discretion overdone. She was\nsurely not to break away at the very moment she had created a want. He\nhad met her as she rose from her little table in a window, where, with\nthe morning papers beside her, she reminded him, as he let her know, of\nMajor Pendennis breakfasting at his club—a compliment of which she\nprofessed a deep appreciation; and he detained her as pleadingly as if\nhe had already—and notably under pressure of the visions of the\nnight—learned to be unable to do without her. She must teach him at all\nevents, before she went, to order breakfast as breakfast was ordered in\nEurope, and she must especially sustain him in the problem of ordering\nfor Waymarsh. The latter had laid upon his friend, by desperate sounds\nthrough the door of his room, dreadful divined responsibilities in\nrespect to beefsteak and oranges—responsibilities which Miss Gostrey\ntook over with an alertness of action that matched her quick\nintelligence. She had before this weaned the expatriated from\ntraditions compared with which the matutinal beefsteak was but the\ncreature of an hour, and it was not for her, with some of her memories,\nto falter in the path though she freely enough declared, on reflexion,\nthat there was always in such cases a choice of opposed policies.\n“There are times when to give them their head, you know—!”\n\nThey had gone to wait together in the garden for the dressing of the\nmeal, and Strether found her more suggestive than ever “Well, what?”\n\n“Is to bring about for them such a complexity of relations—unless\nindeed we call it a simplicity!—that the situation _has_ to wind itself\nup. They want to go back.”\n\n“And you want them to go!” Strether gaily concluded.\n\n“I always want them to go, and I send them as fast as I can.’\n\n“Oh I know—you take them to Liverpool.”\n\n“Any port will serve in a storm. I’m—with all my other functions—an\nagent for repatriation. I want to re-people our stricken country. What\nwill become of it else? I want to discourage others.”\n\nThe ordered English garden, in the freshness of the day, was delightful\nto Strether, who liked the sound, under his feet, of the tight fine\ngravel, packed with the chronic damp, and who had the idlest eye for\nthe deep smoothness of turf and the clean curves of paths. “Other\npeople?”\n\n“Other countries. Other people—yes. I want to encourage our own.”\n\nStrether wondered. “Not to come? Why then do you ‘meet’ them—since it\ndoesn’t appear to be to stop them?”\n\n“Oh that they shouldn’t come is as yet too much to ask. What I attend\nto is that they come quickly and return still more so. I meet them to\nhelp it to be over as soon as possible, and though I don’t stop them\nI’ve my way of putting them through. That’s my little system; and, if\nyou want to know,” said Maria Gostrey, “it’s my real secret, my\ninnermost mission and use. I only seem, you see, to beguile and\napprove; but I’ve thought it all out and I’m working all the while\nunderground. I can’t perhaps quite give you my formula, but I think\nthat practically I succeed. I send you back spent. So you stay back.\nPassed through my hands—”\n\n“We don’t turn up again?” The further she went the further he always\nsaw himself able to follow. “I don’t want your formula—I feel quite\nenough, as I hinted yesterday, your abysses. Spent!” he echoed. “If\nthat’s how you’re arranging so subtly to send me I thank you for the\nwarning.”\n\nFor a minute, amid the pleasantness—poetry in tariffed items, but all\nthe more, for guests already convicted, a challenge to consumption—they\nsmiled at each other in confirmed fellowship. “Do you call it subtly?\nIt’s a plain poor tale. Besides, you’re a special case.”\n\n“Oh special cases—that’s weak!” She was weak enough, further still, to\ndefer her journey and agree to accompany the gentlemen on their own,\nmight a separate carriage mark her independence; though it was in spite\nof this to befall after luncheon that she went off alone and that, with\na tryst taken for a day of her company in London, they lingered another\nnight. She had, during the morning—spent in a way that he was to\nremember later on as the very climax of his foretaste, as warm with\npresentiments, with what he would have called collapses—had all sorts\nof things out with Strether; and among them the fact that though there\nwas never a moment of her life when she wasn’t “due” somewhere, there\nwas yet scarce a perfidy to others of which she wasn’t capable for his\nsake. She explained moreover that wherever she happened to be she found\na dropped thread to pick up, a ragged edge to repair, some familiar\nappetite in ambush, jumping out as she approached, yet appeasable with\na temporary biscuit. It became, on her taking the risk of the deviation\nimposed on him by her insidious arrangement of his morning meal, a\npoint of honour for her not to fail with Waymarsh of the larger success\ntoo; and her subsequent boast to Strether was that she had made their\nfriend fare—and quite without his knowing what was the matter—as Major\nPendennis would have fared at the Megatherium. She had made him\nbreakfast like a gentleman, and it was nothing, she forcibly asserted,\nto what she would yet make him do. She made him participate in the slow\nreiterated ramble with which, for Strether, the new day amply filled\nitself; and it was by her art that he somehow had the air, on the\nramparts and in the Rows, of carrying a point of his own.\n\nThe three strolled and stared and gossiped, or at least the two did;\nthe case really yielding for their comrade, if analysed, but the\nelement of stricken silence. This element indeed affected Strether as\ncharged with audible rumblings, but he was conscious of the care of\ntaking it explicitly as a sign of pleasant peace. He wouldn’t appeal\ntoo much, for that provoked stiffness; yet he wouldn’t be too freely\ntacit, for that suggested giving up. Waymarsh himself adhered to an\nambiguous dumbness that might have represented either the growth of a\nperception or the despair of one; and at times and in places—where the\nlow-browed galleries were darkest, the opposite gables queerest, the\nsolicitations of every kind densest—the others caught him fixing hard\nsome object of minor interest, fixing even at moments nothing\ndiscernible, as if he were indulging it with a truce. When he met\nStrether’s eye on such occasions he looked guilty and furtive, fell the\nnext minute into some attitude of retractation. Our friend couldn’t\nshow him the right things for fear of provoking some total\nrenouncement, and was tempted even to show him the wrong in order to\nmake him differ with triumph. There were moments when he himself felt\nshy of professing the full sweetness of the taste of leisure, and there\nwere others when he found himself feeling as if his passages of\ninterchange with the lady at his side might fall upon the third member\nof their party very much as Mr. Burchell, at Dr. Primrose’s fireside,\nwas influenced by the high flights of the visitors from London. The\nsmallest things so arrested and amused him that he repeatedly almost\napologised—brought up afresh in explanation his plea of a previous\ngrind. He was aware at the same time that his grind had been as nothing\nto Waymarsh’s, and he repeatedly confessed that, to cover his\nfrivolity, he was doing his best for his previous virtue. Do what he\nmight, in any case, his previous virtue was still there, and it seemed\nfairly to stare at him out of the windows of shops that were not as the\nshops of Woollett, fairly to make him want things that he shouldn’t\nknow what to do with. It was by the oddest, the least admissible of\nlaws demoralising him now; and the way it boldly took was to make him\nwant more wants. These first walks in Europe were in fact a kind of\nfinely lurid intimation of what one might find at the end of that\nprocess. Had he come back after long years, in something already so\nlike the evening of life, only to be exposed to it? It was at all\nevents over the shop-windows that he made, with Waymarsh, most free;\nthough it would have been easier had not the latter most sensibly\nyielded to the appeal of the merely useful trades. He pierced with his\nsombre detachment the plate-glass of ironmongers and saddlers, while\nStrether flaunted an affinity with the dealers in stamped letter-paper\nand in smart neckties. Strether was in fact recurrently shameless in\nthe presence of the tailors, though it was just over the heads of the\ntailors that his countryman most loftily looked. This gave Miss Gostrey\na grasped opportunity to back up Waymarsh at his expense. The weary\nlawyer—it was unmistakeable—had a conception of dress; but that, in\nview of some of the features of the effect produced, was just what made\nthe danger of insistence on it. Strether wondered if he by this time\nthought Miss Gostrey less fashionable or Lambert Strether more so; and\nit appeared probable that most of the remarks exchanged between this\nlatter pair about passers, figures, faces, personal types, exemplified\nin their degree the disposition to talk as “society” talked.\n\nWas what was happening to himself then, was what already _had_\nhappened, really that a woman of fashion was floating him into society\nand that an old friend deserted on the brink was watching the force of\nthe current? When the woman of fashion permitted Strether—as she\npermitted him at the most—the purchase of a pair of gloves, the terms\nshe made about it, the prohibition of neckties and other items till she\nshould be able to guide him through the Burlington Arcade, were such as\nto fall upon a sensitive ear as a challenge to just imputations. Miss\nGostrey was such a woman of fashion as could make without a symptom of\nvulgar blinking an appointment for the Burlington Arcade. Mere\ndiscriminations about a pair of gloves could thus at any rate\nrepresent—always for such sensitive ears as were in\nquestion—possibilities of something that Strether could make a mark\nagainst only as the peril of apparent wantonness. He had quite the\nconsciousness of his new friend, for their companion, that he might\nhave had of a Jesuit in petticoats, a representative of the recruiting\ninterests of the Catholic Church. The Catholic Church, for\nWaymarsh—that was to say the enemy, the monster of bulging eyes and\nfar-reaching quivering groping tentacles—was exactly society, exactly\nthe multiplication of shibboleths, exactly the discrimination of types\nand tones, exactly the wicked old Rows of Chester, rank with feudalism;\nexactly in short Europe.\n\nThere was light for observation, however, in an incident that occurred\njust before they turned back to luncheon. Waymarsh had been for a\nquarter of an hour exceptionally mute and distant, and something, or\nother—Strether was never to make out exactly what—proved, as it were,\ntoo much for him after his comrades had stood for three minutes taking\nin, while they leaned on an old balustrade that guarded the edge of the\nRow, a particularly crooked and huddled street-view. “He thinks us\nsophisticated, he thinks us worldly, he thinks us wicked, he thinks us\nall sorts of queer things,” Strether reflected; for wondrous were the\nvague quantities our friend had within a couple of short days acquired\nthe habit of conveniently and conclusively lumping together. There\nseemed moreover a direct connexion between some such inference and a\nsudden grim dash taken by Waymarsh to the opposite side. This movement\nwas startlingly sudden, and his companions at first supposed him to\nhave espied, to be pursuing, the glimpse of an acquaintance. They next\nmade out, however, that an open door had instantly received him, and\nthey then recognised him as engulfed in the establishment of a\njeweller, behind whose glittering front he was lost to view. The fact\nhad somehow the note of a demonstration, and it left each of the others\nto show a face almost of fear. But Miss Gostrey broke into a laugh.\n“What’s the matter with him?”\n\n“Well,” said Strether, “he can’t stand it.”\n\n“But can’t stand what?”\n\n“Anything. Europe.”\n\n“Then how will that jeweller help him?”\n\nStrether seemed to make it out, from their position, between the\ninterstices of arrayed watches, of close-hung dangling gewgaws. “You’ll\nsee.”\n\n“Ah that’s just what—if he buys anything—I’m afraid of: that I shall\nsee something rather dreadful.”\n\nStrether studied the finer appearances. “He may buy everything.”\n\n“Then don’t you think we ought to follow him?”\n\n“Not for worlds. Besides we can’t. We’re paralysed. We exchange a long\nscared look, we publicly tremble. The thing is, you see, we ‘realise.’\nHe has struck for freedom.”\n\nShe wondered but she laughed. “Ah what a price to pay! And I was\npreparing some for him so cheap.”\n\n“No, no,” Strether went on, frankly amused now; “don’t call it that:\nthe kind of freedom you deal in is dear.” Then as to justify himself:\n“Am I not in _my_ way trying it? It’s this.”\n\n“Being here, you mean, with me?”\n\n“Yes, and talking to you as I do. I’ve known you a few hours, and I’ve\nknown _him_ all my life; so that if the ease I thus take with you about\nhim isn’t magnificent”—and the thought of it held him a moment—“why\nit’s rather base.”\n\n“It’s magnificent!” said Miss Gostrey to make an end of it. “And you\nshould hear,” she added, “the ease _I_ take—and I above all intend to\ntake—with Mr. Waymarsh.”\n\nStrether thought. “About _me?_ Ah that’s no equivalent. The equivalent\nwould be Waymarsh’s himself serving me up—his remorseless analysis of\nme. And he’ll never do that”—he was sadly clear. “He’ll never\nremorselessly analyse me.” He quite held her with the authority of\nthis. “He’ll never say a word to you about me.”\n\nShe took it in; she did it justice; yet after an instant her reason,\nher restless irony, disposed of it. “Of course he won’t. For what do\nyou take people, that they’re able to say words about anything, able\nremorselessly to analyse? There are not many like you and me. It will\nbe only because he’s too stupid.”\n\nIt stirred in her friend a sceptical echo which was at the same time\nthe protest of the faith of years. “Waymarsh stupid?”\n\n“Compared with you.”\n\nStrether had still his eyes on the jeweller’s front, and he waited a\nmoment to answer. “He’s a success of a kind that I haven’t approached.”\n\n“Do you mean he has made money?”\n\n“He makes it—to my belief. And I,” said Strether, “though with a back\nquite as bent, have never made anything. I’m a perfectly equipped\nfailure.”\n\nHe feared an instant she’d ask him if he meant he was poor; and he was\nglad she didn’t, for he really didn’t know to what the truth on this\nunpleasant point mightn’t have prompted her. She only, however,\nconfirmed his assertion. “Thank goodness you’re a failure—it’s why I so\ndistinguish you! Anything else to-day is too hideous. Look about\nyou—look at the successes. Would you _be_ one, on your honour? Look,\nmoreover,” she continued, “at me.”\n\nFor a little accordingly their eyes met. “I see,” Strether returned.\n“You too are out of it.”\n\n“The superiority you discern in me,” she concurred, “announces my\nfutility. If you knew,” she sighed, “the dreams of my youth! But our\nrealities are what has brought us together. We’re beaten brothers in\narms.”\n\nHe smiled at her kindly enough, but he shook his head. “It doesn’t\nalter the fact that you’re expensive. You’ve cost me already—!”\n\nBut he had hung fire. “Cost you what?”\n\n“Well, my past—in one great lump. But no matter,” he laughed: “I’ll pay\nwith my last penny.”\n\nHer attention had unfortunately now been engaged by their comrade’s\nreturn, for Waymarsh met their view as he came out of his shop. “I hope\nhe hasn’t paid,” she said, “with _his_ last; though I’m convinced he\nhas been splendid, and has been so for you.”\n\n“Ah no—not that!”\n\n“Then for me?”\n\n“Quite as little.” Waymarsh was by this time near enough to show signs\nhis friend could read, though he seemed to look almost carefully at\nnothing in particular.\n\n“Then for himself?”\n\n“For nobody. For nothing. For freedom.”\n\n“But what has freedom to do with it?”\n\nStrether’s answer was indirect. “To be as good as you and me. But\ndifferent.”\n\nShe had had time to take in their companion’s face; and with it, as\nsuch things were easy for her, she took in all. “Different—yes. But\nbetter!”\n\nIf Waymarsh was sombre he was also indeed almost sublime. He told them\nnothing, left his absence unexplained, and though they were convinced\nhe had made some extraordinary purchase they were never to learn its\nnature. He only glowered grandly at the tops of the old gables. “It’s\nthe sacred rage,” Strether had had further time to say; and this sacred\nrage was to become between them, for convenient comprehension, the\ndescription of one of his periodical necessities. It was Strether who\neventually contended that it did make him better than they. But by that\ntime Miss Gostrey was convinced that she didn’t want to be better than\nStrether.\n\n\nBook Second\n\n I\n\nThose occasions on which Strether was, in association with the exile\nfrom Milrose, to see the sacred rage glimmer through would doubtless\nhave their due periodicity; but our friend had meanwhile to find names\nfor many other matters. On no evening of his life perhaps, as he\nreflected, had he had to supply so many as on the third of his short\nstay in London; an evening spent by Miss Gostrey’s side at one of the\ntheatres, to which he had found himself transported, without his own\nhand raised, on the mere expression of a conscientious wonder. She knew\nher theatre, she knew her play, as she had triumphantly known, three\ndays running, everything else, and the moment filled to the brim, for\nher companion, that apprehension of the interesting which, whether or\nno the interesting happened to filter through his guide, strained now\nto its limits his brief opportunity. Waymarsh hadn’t come with them; he\nhad seen plays enough, he signified, before Strether had joined him—an\naffirmation that had its full force when his friend ascertained by\nquestions that he had seen two and a circus. Questions as to what he\nhad seen had on him indeed an effect only less favourable than\nquestions as to what he hadn’t. He liked the former to be\ndiscriminated; but how could it be done, Strether asked of their\nconstant counsellor, without discriminating the latter?\n\nMiss Gostrey had dined with him at his hotel, face to face over a small\ntable on which the lighted candles had rose-coloured shades; and the\nrose-coloured shades and the small table and the soft fragrance of the\nlady—had anything to his mere sense ever been so soft?—were so many\ntouches in he scarce knew what positive high picture. He had been to\nthe theatre, even to the opera, in Boston, with Mrs. Newsome, more than\nonce acting as her only escort; but there had been no little confronted\ndinner, no pink lights, no whiff of vague sweetness, as a preliminary:\none of the results of which was that at present, mildly rueful, though\nwith a sharpish accent, he actually asked himself _why_ there hadn’t.\nThere was much the same difference in his impression of the noticed\nstate of his companion, whose dress was “cut down,” as he believed the\nterm to be, in respect to shoulders and bosom, in a manner quite other\nthan Mrs. Newsome’s, and who wore round her throat a broad red velvet\nband with an antique jewel—he was rather complacently sure it was\nantique—attached to it in front. Mrs. Newsome’s dress was never in any\ndegree “cut down,” and she never wore round her throat a broad red\nvelvet band: if she had, moreover, would it ever have served so to\ncarry on and complicate, as he now almost felt, his vision?\n\nIt would have been absurd of him to trace into ramifications the effect\nof the ribbon from which Miss Gostrey’s trinket depended, had he not\nfor the hour, at the best, been so given over to uncontrolled\nperceptions. What was it but an uncontrolled perception that his\nfriend’s velvet band somehow added, in her appearance, to the value of\nevery other item—to that of her smile and of the way she carried her\nhead, to that of her complexion, of her lips, her teeth, her eyes, her\nhair? What, certainly, had a man conscious of a man’s work in the world\nto do with red velvet bands? He wouldn’t for anything have so exposed\nhimself as to tell Miss Gostrey how much he liked hers, yet he _had_\nnone the less not only caught himself in the act—frivolous, no doubt,\nidiotic, and above all unexpected—of liking it: he had in addition\ntaken it as a starting-point for fresh backward, fresh forward, fresh\nlateral flights. The manner in which Mrs. Newsome’s throat _was_\nencircled suddenly represented for him, in an alien order, almost as\nmany things as the manner in which Miss Gostrey’s was. Mrs. Newsome\nwore, at operatic hours, a black silk dress—very handsome, he knew it\nwas “handsome”—and an ornament that his memory was able further to\nidentify as a ruche. He had his association indeed with the ruche, but\nit was rather imperfectly romantic. He had once said to the wearer—and\nit was as “free” a remark as he had ever made to her—that she looked,\nwith her ruff and other matters, like Queen Elizabeth; and it had after\nthis in truth been his fancy that, as a consequence of that tenderness\nand an acceptance of the idea, the form of this special tribute to the\n“frill” had grown slightly more marked. The connexion, as he sat there\nand let his imagination roam, was to strike him as vaguely pathetic;\nbut there it all was, and pathetic was doubtless in the conditions the\nbest thing it could possibly be. It had assuredly existed at any rate;\nfor it seemed now to come over him that no gentleman of his age at\nWoollett could ever, to a lady of Mrs. Newsome’s, which was not much\nless than his, have embarked on such a simile.\n\nAll sorts of things in fact now seemed to come over him, comparatively\nfew of which his chronicler can hope for space to mention. It came over\nhim for instance that Miss Gostrey looked perhaps like Mary Stuart:\nLambert Strether had a candour of fancy which could rest for an instant\ngratified in such an antithesis. It came over him that never before—no,\nliterally never—had a lady dined with him at a public place before\ngoing to the play. The publicity of the place was just, in the matter,\nfor Strether, the rare strange thing; it affected him almost as the\nachievement of privacy might have affected a man of a different\nexperience. He had married, in the far-away years, so young as to have\nmissed the time natural in Boston for taking girls to the Museum; and\nit was absolutely true of hint that—even after the close of the period\nof conscious detachment occupying the centre of his life, the grey\nmiddle desert of the two deaths, that of his wife and that, ten years\nlater, of his boy—he had never taken any one anywhere. It came over him\nin especial—though the monition had, as happened, already sounded,\nfitfully gleamed, in other forms—that the business he had come out on\nhadn’t yet been so brought home to him as by the sight of the people\nabout him. She gave him the impression, his friend, at first, more\nstraight than he got it for himself—gave it simply by saying with\noff-hand illumination: “Oh yes, they’re types!”—but after he had taken\nit he made to the full his own use of it; both while he kept silence\nfor the four acts and while he talked in the intervals. It was an\nevening, it was a world of types, and this was a connexion above all in\nwhich the figures and faces in the stalls were interchangeable with\nthose on the stage.\n\nHe felt as if the play itself penetrated him with the naked elbow of\nhis neighbour, a great stripped handsome red-haired lady who conversed\nwith a gentleman on her other side in stray dissyllables which had for\nhis ear, in the oddest way in the world, so much sound that he wondered\nthey hadn’t more sense; and he recognised by the same law, beyond the\nfootlights, what he was pleased to take for the very flush of English\nlife. He had distracted drops in which he couldn’t have said if it were\nactors or auditors who were most true, and the upshot of which, each\ntime, was the consciousness of new contacts. However he viewed his job\nit was “types” he should have to tackle. Those before him and around\nhim were not as the types of Woollett, where, for that matter, it had\nbegun to seem to him that there must only have been the male and the\nfemale. These made two exactly, even with the individual varieties.\nHere, on the other hand, apart from the personal and the sexual\nrange—which might be greater or less—a series of strong stamps had been\napplied, as it were, from without; stamps that his observation played\nwith as, before a glass case on a table, it might have passed from\nmedal to medal and from copper to gold. It befell that in the drama\nprecisely there was a bad woman in a yellow frock who made a pleasant\nweak good-looking young man in perpetual evening dress do the most\ndreadful things. Strether felt himself on the whole not afraid of the\nyellow frock, but he was vaguely anxious over a certain kindness into\nwhich he found himself drifting for its victim. He hadn’t come out, he\nreminded himself, to be too kind, or indeed to be kind at all, to\nChadwick Newsome. Would Chad also be in perpetual evening dress? He\nsomehow rather hoped it—it seemed so to add to _this_ young man’s\ngeneral amenability; though he wondered too if, to fight him with his\nown weapons, he himself (a thought almost startling) would have\nlikewise to be. This young man furthermore would have been much more\neasy to handle—at least for _him_—than appeared probable in respect to\nChad.\n\nIt came up for him with Miss Gostrey that there were things of which\nshe would really perhaps after all have heard, and she admitted when a\nlittle pressed that she was never quite sure of what she heard as\ndistinguished from things such as, on occasions like the present, she\nonly extravagantly guessed. “I seem with this freedom, you see, to have\nguessed Mr. Chad. He’s a young man on whose head high hopes are placed\nat Woollett; a young man a wicked woman has got hold of and whom his\nfamily over there have sent you out to rescue. You’ve accepted the\nmission of separating him from the wicked woman. Are you quite sure\nshe’s very bad for him?”\n\nSomething in his manner showed it as quite pulling him up. “Of course\nwe are. Wouldn’t _you_ be?”\n\n“Oh I don’t know. One never does—does one?—beforehand. One can only\njudge on the facts. Yours are quite new to me; I’m really not in the\nleast, as you see, in possession of them: so it will be awfully\ninteresting to have them from you. If you’re satisfied, that’s all\nthat’s required. I mean if you’re sure you _are_ sure: sure it won’t\ndo.”\n\n“That he should lead such a life? Rather!”\n\n“Oh but I don’t know, you see, about his life; you’ve not told me about\nhis life. She may be charming—his life!”\n\n“Charming?”—Strether stared before him. “She’s base, venal—out of the\nstreets.”\n\n“I see. And _he_—?”\n\n“Chad, wretched boy?”\n\n“Of what type and temper is he?” she went on as Strether had lapsed.\n\n“Well—the obstinate.” It was as if for a moment he had been going to\nsay more and had then controlled himself.\n\nThat was scarce what she wished. “Do you like him?”\n\nThis time he was prompt. “No. How _can_ I?”\n\n“Do you mean because of your being so saddled with him?”\n\n“I’m thinking of his mother,” said Strether after a moment. “He has\ndarkened her admirable life.” He spoke with austerity. “He has worried\nher half to death.”\n\n“Oh that’s of course odious.” She had a pause as if for renewed\nemphasis of this truth, but it ended on another note. “Is her life very\nadmirable?”\n\n“Extraordinarily.”\n\nThere was so much in the tone that Miss Gostrey had to devote another\npause to the appreciation of it. “And has he only _her?_ I don’t mean\nthe bad woman in Paris,” she quickly added—“for I assure you I\nshouldn’t even at the best be disposed to allow him more than one. But\nhas he only his mother?”\n\n“He has also a sister, older than himself and married; and they’re both\nremarkably fine women.”\n\n“Very handsome, you mean?”\n\nThis promptitude—almost, as he might have thought, this precipitation,\ngave him a brief drop; but he came up again. “Mrs. Newsome, I think, is\nhandsome, though she’s not of course, with a son of twenty-eight and a\ndaughter of thirty, in her very first youth. She married, however,\nextremely young.”\n\n“And is wonderful,” Miss Gostrey asked, “for her age?”\n\nStrether seemed to feel with a certain disquiet the pressure of it. “I\ndon’t say she’s wonderful. Or rather,” he went on the next moment, “I\ndo say it. It’s exactly what she _is_—wonderful. But I wasn’t thinking\nof her appearance,” he explained—“striking as that doubtless is. I was\nthinking—well, of many other things.” He seemed to look at these as if\nto mention some of them; then took, pulling himself up, another turn.\n“About Mrs. Pocock people may differ.”\n\n“Is that the daughter’s name—‘Pocock’?”\n\n“That’s the daughter’s name,” Strether sturdily confessed.\n\n“And people may differ, you mean, about _her_ beauty?”\n\n“About everything.”\n\n“But _you_ admire her?”\n\nHe gave his friend a glance as to show how he could bear this “I’m\nperhaps a little afraid of her.”\n\n“Oh,” said Miss Gostrey, “I see her from here! You may say then I see\nvery fast and very far, but I’ve already shown you I do. The young man\nand the two ladies,” she went on, “are at any rate all the family?”\n\n“Quite all. His father has been dead ten years, and there’s no brother,\nnor any other sister. They’d do,” said Strether, “anything in the world\nfor him.”\n\n“And you’d do anything in the world for _them?_”\n\nHe shifted again; she had made it perhaps just a shade too affirmative\nfor his nerves. “Oh I don’t know!”\n\n“You’d do at any rate this, and the ‘anything’ they’d do is represented\nby their _making_ you do it.”\n\n“Ah they couldn’t have come—either of them. They’re very busy people\nand Mrs. Newsome in particular has a large full life. She’s moreover\nhighly nervous—and not at all strong.”\n\n“You mean she’s an American invalid?”\n\nHe carefully distinguished. “There’s nothing she likes less than to be\ncalled one, but she would consent to be one of those things, I think,”\nhe laughed, “if it were the only way to be the other.”\n\n“Consent to be an American in order to be an invalid?”\n\n“No,” said Strether, “the other way round. She’s at any rate delicate\nsensitive high-strung. She puts so much of herself into everything—”\n\nAh Maria knew these things! “That she has nothing left for anything\nelse? Of course she hasn’t. To whom do you say it? High-strung? Don’t I\nspend my life, for them, jamming down the pedal? I see moreover how it\nhas told on you.”\n\nStrether took this more lightly. “Oh I jam down the pedal too!”\n\n“Well,” she lucidly returned, “we must from this moment bear on it\ntogether with all our might.” And she forged ahead. “Have they money?”\n\nBut it was as if, while her energetic image still held him, her enquiry\nfell short. “Mrs. Newsome,” he wished further to explain, “hasn’t\nmoreover your courage on the question of contact. If she had come it\nwould have been to see the person herself.”\n\n“The woman? Ah but that’s courage.”\n\n“No—it’s exaltation, which is a very different thing. Courage,” he,\nhowever, accommodatingly threw out, “is what _you_ have.”\n\nShe shook her head. “You say that only to patch me up—to cover the\nnudity of my want of exaltation. I’ve neither the one nor the other.\nI’ve mere battered indifference. I see that what you mean,” Miss\nGostrey pursued, “is that if your friend _had_ come she would take\ngreat views, and the great views, to put it simply, would be too much\nfor her.”\n\nStrether looked amused at her notion of the simple, but he adopted her\nformula. “Everything’s too much for her.”\n\n“Ah then such a service as this of yours—”\n\n“Is more for her than anything else? Yes—far more. But so long as it\nisn’t too much for _me_—!”\n\n“Her condition doesn’t matter? Surely not; we leave her condition out;\nwe take it, that is, for granted. I see it, her condition, as behind\nand beneath you; yet at the same time I see it as bearing you up.”\n\n“Oh it does bear me up!” Strether laughed.\n\n“Well then as yours bears _me_ nothing more’s needed.” With which she\nput again her question. “Has Mrs. Newsome money?”\n\nThis time he heeded. “Oh plenty. That’s the root of the evil. There’s\nmoney, to very large amounts, in the concern. Chad has had the free use\nof a great deal. But if he’ll pull himself together and come home, all\nthe same, he’ll find his account in it.”\n\nShe had listened with all her interest. “And I hope to goodness you’ll\nfind yours!”\n\n“He’ll take up his definite material reward,” said Strether without\nacknowledgement of this. “He’s at the parting of the ways. He can come\ninto the business now—he can’t come later.”\n\n“Is there a business?”\n\n“Lord, yes—a big brave bouncing business. A roaring trade.”\n\n“A great shop?”\n\n“Yes—a workshop; a great production, a great industry. The concern’s a\nmanufacture—and a manufacture that, if it’s only properly looked after,\nmay well be on the way to become a monopoly. It’s a little thing they\nmake—make better, it appears, than other people can, or than other\npeople, at any rate, do. Mr. Newsome, being a man of ideas, at least in\nthat particular line,” Strether explained, “put them on it with great\neffect, and gave the place altogether, in his time, an immense lift.”\n\n“It’s a place in itself?”\n\n“Well, quite a number of buildings; almost a little industrial colony.\nBut above all it’s a thing. The article produced.”\n\n“And what _is_ the article produced?”\n\nStrether looked about him as in slight reluctance to say; then the\ncurtain, which he saw about to rise, came to his aid. “I’ll tell you\nnext time.” But when the next time came he only said he’d tell her\nlater on—after they should have left the theatre; for she had\nimmediately reverted to their topic, and even for himself the picture\nof the stage was now overlaid with another image. His postponements,\nhowever, made her wonder—wonder if the article referred to were\nanything bad. And she explained that she meant improper or ridiculous\nor wrong. But Strether, so far as that went, could satisfy her.\n“Unmentionable? Oh no, we constantly talk of it; we are quite familiar\nand brazen about it. Only, as a small, trivial, rather ridiculous\nobject of the commonest domestic use, it’s just wanting in—what shall I\nsay? Well, dignity, or the least approach to distinction. Right here\ntherefore, with everything about us so grand—!” In short he shrank.\n\n“It’s a false note?”\n\n“Sadly. It’s vulgar.”\n\n“But surely not vulgarer than this.” Then on his wondering as she\nherself had done: “Than everything about us.” She seemed a trifle\nirritated. “What do you take this for?”\n\n“Why for—comparatively—divine!”\n\n“This dreadful London theatre? It’s impossible, if you really want to\nknow.”\n\n“Oh then,” laughed Strether, “I _don’t_ really want to know!”\n\nIt made between them a pause, which she, however, still fascinated by\nthe mystery of the production at Woollett, presently broke. “‘Rather\nridiculous’? Clothes-pins? Saleratus? Shoe-polish?”\n\nIt brought him round. “No—you don’t even ‘burn.’ I don’t think, you\nknow, you’ll guess it.”\n\n“How then can I judge how vulgar it is?”\n\n“You’ll judge when I do tell you”—and he persuaded her to patience. But\nit may even now frankly be mentioned that he in the sequel never _was_\nto tell her. He actually never did so, and it moreover oddly occurred\nthat by the law, within her, of the incalculable, her desire for the\ninformation dropped and her attitude to the question converted itself\ninto a positive cultivation of ignorance. In ignorance she could humour\nher fancy, and that proved a useful freedom. She could treat the little\nnameless object as indeed unnameable—she could make their abstention\nenormously definite. There might indeed have been for Strether the\nportent of this in what she next said.\n\n“Is it perhaps then because it’s so bad—because your industry as you\ncall it, _is_ so vulgar—that Mr. Chad won’t come back? Does he feel the\ntaint? Is he staying away not to be mixed up in it?”\n\n“Oh,” Strether laughed, “it wouldn’t appear—would it?—that he feels\n‘taints’! He’s glad enough of the money from it, and the money’s his\nwhole basis. There’s appreciation in that—I mean as to the allowance\nhis mother has hitherto made him. She has of course the resource of\ncutting this allowance off; but even then he has unfortunately, and on\nno small scale, his independent supply—money left him by his\ngrandfather, her own father.”\n\n“Wouldn’t the fact you mention then,” Miss Gostrey asked, “make it just\nmore easy for him to be particular? Isn’t he conceivable as fastidious\nabout the source—the apparent and public source—of his income?”\n\nStrether was able quite good-humouredly to entertain the proposition.\n“The source of his grandfather’s wealth—and thereby of his own share in\nit—was not particularly noble.”\n\n“And what source was it?”\n\nStrether cast about. “Well—practices.”\n\n“In business? Infamies? He was an old swindler?”\n\n“Oh,” he said with more emphasis than spirit, “I shan’t describe _him_\nnor narrate his exploits.”\n\n“Lord, what abysses! And the late Mr. Newsome then?”\n\n“Well, what about him?”\n\n“Was he like the grandfather?”\n\n“No—he was on the other side of the house. And he was different.”\n\nMiss Gostrey kept it up. “Better?”\n\nHer friend for a moment hung fire. “No.”\n\nHer comment on his hesitation was scarce the less marked for being\nmute. “Thank you. _Now_ don’t you see,” she went on, “why the boy\ndoesn’t come home? He’s drowning his shame.”\n\n“His shame? What shame?”\n\n“What shame? Comment donc? _The_ shame.”\n\n“But where and when,” Strether asked, “is ‘_the_ shame’—where is any\nshame—to-day? The men I speak of—they did as every one does; and\n(besides being ancient history) it was all a matter of appreciation.”\n\nShe showed how she understood. “Mrs. Newsome has appreciated?”\n\n“Ah I can’t speak for _her!_”\n\n“In the midst of such doings—and, as I understand you, profiting by\nthem, she at least has remained exquisite?”\n\n“Oh I can’t talk of her!” Strether said.\n\n“I thought she was just what you _could_ talk of. You _don’t_ trust\nme,” Miss Gostrey after a moment declared.\n\nIt had its effect. “Well, her money is spent, her life conceived and\ncarried on with a large beneficence—”\n\n“That’s a kind of expiation of wrongs? Gracious,” she added before he\ncould speak, “how intensely you make me see her!”\n\n“If you see her,” Strether dropped, “it’s all that’s necessary.”\n\nShe really seemed to have her. “I feel that. She _is_, in spite of\neverything, handsome.”\n\nThis at least enlivened him. “What do you mean by everything?”\n\n“Well, I mean _you_.” With which she had one of her swift changes of\nground. “You say the concern needs looking after; but doesn’t Mrs.\nNewsome look after it?”\n\n“So far as possible. She’s wonderfully able, but it’s not her affair,\nand her life’s a good deal overcharged. She has many, many things.”\n\n“And you also?”\n\n“Oh yes—I’ve many too, if you will.”\n\n“I see. But what I mean is,” Miss Gostrey amended, “do you also look\nafter the business?”\n\n“Oh no, I don’t touch the business.”\n\n“Only everything else?”\n\n“Well, yes—some things.”\n\n“As for instance—?”\n\nStrether obligingly thought. “Well, the Review.”\n\n“The Review?—you have a Review?”\n\n“Certainly. Woollett has a Review—which Mrs. Newsome, for the most\npart, magnificently pays for and which I, not at all magnificently,\nedit. My name’s on the cover,” Strether pursued, “and I’m really rather\ndisappointed and hurt that you seem never to have heard of it.”\n\nShe neglected for a moment this grievance. “And what kind of a Review\nis it?”\n\nHis serenity was now completely restored. “Well, it’s green.”\n\n“Do you mean in political colour as they say here—in thought?”\n\n“No; I mean the cover’s green—of the most lovely shade.”\n\n“And with Mrs. Newsome’s name on it too?”\n\nHe waited a little. “Oh as for that you must judge if she peeps out.\nShe’s behind the whole thing; but she’s of a delicacy and a\ndiscretion—!”\n\nMiss Gostrey took it all. “I’m sure. She _would_ be. I don’t underrate\nher. She must be rather a swell.”\n\n“Oh yes, she’s rather a swell!”\n\n“A Woollett swell—_bon!_ I like the idea of a Woollett swell. And you\nmust be rather one too, to be so mixed up with her.”\n\n“Ah no,” said Strether, “that’s not the way it works.”\n\nBut she had already taken him up. “The way it works—you needn’t tell\nme!—is of course that you efface yourself.”\n\n“With my name on the cover?” he lucidly objected.\n\n“Ah but you don’t put it on for yourself.”\n\n“I beg your pardon—that’s exactly what I do put it on for. It’s exactly\nthe thing that I’m reduced to doing for myself. It seems to rescue a\nlittle, you see, from the wreck of hopes and ambitions, the refuse-heap\nof disappointments and failures, my one presentable little scrap of an\nidentity.”\n\nOn this she looked at him as to say many things, but what she at last\nsimply said was: “She likes to see it there. You’re the bigger swell of\nthe two,” she immediately continued, “because you think you’re not one.\nShe thinks she _is_ one. However,” Miss Gostrey added, “she thinks\nyou’re one too. You’re at all events the biggest she can get hold of.”\nShe embroidered, she abounded. “I don’t say it to interfere between\nyou, but on the day she gets hold of a bigger one—!” Strether had\nthrown back his head as in silent mirth over something that struck him\nin her audacity or felicity, and her flight meanwhile was already\nhigher. “Therefore close with her—!”\n\n“Close with her?” he asked as she seemed to hang poised.\n\n“Before you lose your chance.”\n\nTheir eyes met over it. “What do you mean by closing?”\n\n“And what do I mean by your chance? I’ll tell you when you tell me all\nthe things _you_ don’t. Is it her _greatest_ fad?” she briskly pursued.\n\n“The Review?” He seemed to wonder how he could best describe it. This\nresulted however but in a sketch. “It’s her tribute to the ideal.”\n\n“I see. You go in for tremendous things.”\n\n“We go in for the unpopular side—that is so far as we dare.”\n\n“And how far _do_ you dare?”\n\n“Well, she very far. I much less. I don’t begin to have her faith. She\nprovides,” said Strether, “three fourths of that. And she provides, as\nI’ve confided to you, _all_ the money.”\n\nIt evoked somehow a vision of gold that held for a little Miss\nGostrey’s eyes, and she looked as if she heard the bright dollars\nshovelled in. “I hope then you make a good thing—”\n\n“I _never_ made a good thing!” he at once returned.\n\nShe just waited. “Don’t you call it a good thing to be loved?”\n\n“Oh we’re not loved. We’re not even hated. We’re only just sweetly\nignored.”\n\nShe had another pause. “You don’t trust me!” she once more repeated.\n\n“Don’t I when I lift the last veil?—tell you the very secret of the\nprison-house?”\n\nAgain she met his eyes, but to the result that after an instant her own\nturned away with impatience. “You don’t sell? Oh I’m glad of _that!_”\nAfter which however, and before he could protest, she was off again.\n“She’s just a _moral_ swell.”\n\nHe accepted gaily enough the definition. “Yes—I really think that\ndescribes her.”\n\nBut it had for his friend the oddest connexion. “How does she do her\nhair?”\n\nHe laughed out. “Beautifully!”\n\n“Ah that doesn’t tell me. However, it doesn’t matter—I know. It’s\ntremendously neat—a real reproach; quite remarkably thick and without,\nas yet, a single strand of white. There!”\n\nHe blushed for her realism, but gaped at her truth. “You’re the very\ndeuce.”\n\n“What else _should_ I be? It was as the very deuce I pounced on you.\nBut don’t let it trouble you, for everything but the very deuce—at our\nage—is a bore and a delusion, and even he himself, after all, but half\na joy.” With which, on a single sweep of her wing, she resumed. “You\nassist her to expiate—which is rather hard when you’ve yourself not\nsinned.”\n\n“It’s she who hasn’t sinned,” Strether replied. “I’ve sinned the most.”\n\n“Ah,” Miss Gostrey cynically laughed, “what a picture of _her!_ Have\nyou robbed the widow and the orphan?”\n\n“I’ve sinned enough,” said Strether.\n\n“Enough for whom? Enough for what?”\n\n“Well, to be where I am.”\n\n“Thank you!” They were disturbed at this moment by the passage between\ntheir knees and the back of the seats before them of a gentleman who\nhad been absent during a part of the performance and who now returned\nfor the close; but the interruption left Miss Gostrey time, before the\nsubsequent hush, to express as a sharp finality her sense of the moral\nof all their talk. “I knew you had something up your sleeve!” This\nfinality, however, left them in its turn, at the end of the play, as\ndisposed to hang back as if they had still much to say; so that they\neasily agreed to let every one go before them—they found an interest in\nwaiting. They made out from the lobby that the night had turned to\nrain; yet Miss Gostrey let her friend know that he wasn’t to see her\nhome. He was simply to put her, by herself, into a four-wheeler; she\nliked so in London, of wet nights after wild pleasures, thinking things\nover, on the return, in lonely four-wheelers. This was her great time,\nshe intimated, for pulling herself together. The delays caused by the\nweather, the struggle for vehicles at the door, gave them occasion to\nsubside on a divan at the back of the vestibule and just beyond the\nreach of the fresh damp gusts from the street. Here Strether’s comrade\nresumed that free handling of the subject to which his own imagination\nof it already owed so much. “Does your young friend in Paris like you?”\n\nIt had almost, after the interval, startled him. “Oh I hope not! Why\n_should_ he?”\n\n“Why shouldn’t he?” Miss Gostrey asked. “That you’re coming down on him\nneed have nothing to do with it.”\n\n“You see more in it,” he presently returned, “than I.”\n\n“Of course I see _you_ in it.”\n\n“Well then you see more in ‘me’!”\n\n“Than you see in yourself? Very likely. That’s always one’s right. What\nI was thinking of,” she explained, “is the possible particular effect\non him of his _milieu_.”\n\n“Oh his _milieu_—!” Strether really felt he could imagine it better now\nthan three hours before.\n\n“Do you mean it can only have been so lowering?”\n\n“Why that’s my very starting-point.”\n\n“Yes, but you start so far back. What do his letters say?”\n\n“Nothing. He practically ignores us—or spares us. He doesn’t write.”\n\n“I see. But there are all the same,” she went on, “two quite distinct\nthings that—given the wonderful place he’s in—may have happened to him.\nOne is that he may have got brutalised. The other is that he may have\ngot refined.”\n\nStrether stared—this _was_ a novelty. “Refined?”\n\n“Oh,” she said quietly, “there _are_ refinements.”\n\nThe way of it made him, after looking at her, break into a laugh.\n“_You_ have them!”\n\n“As one of the signs,” she continued in the same tone, “they constitute\nperhaps the worst.”\n\nHe thought it over and his gravity returned. “Is it a refinement not to\nanswer his mother’s letters?”\n\nShe appeared to have a scruple, but she brought it out. “Oh I should\nsay the greatest of all.”\n\n“Well,” said Strether, “_I’m_ quite content to let it, as one of the\nsigns, pass for the worst that I know he believes he can do what he\nlikes with me.”\n\nThis appeared to strike her. “How do you know it?”\n\n“Oh I’m sure of it. I feel it in my bones.”\n\n“Feel he _can_ do it?”\n\n“Feel that he believes he can. It may come to the same thing!” Strether\nlaughed.\n\nShe wouldn’t, however, have this. “Nothing for you will ever come to\nthe same thing as anything else.” And she understood what she meant, it\nseemed, sufficiently to go straight on. “You say that if he does break\nhe’ll come in for things at home?”\n\n“Quite positively. He’ll come in for a particular chance—a chance that\nany properly constituted young man would jump at. The business has so\ndeveloped that an opening scarcely apparent three years ago, but which\nhis father’s will took account of as in certain conditions possible and\nwhich, under that will, attaches to Chad’s availing himself of it a\nlarge contingent advantage—this opening, the conditions having come\nabout, now simply awaits him. His mother has kept it for him, holding\nout against strong pressure, till the last possible moment. It\nrequires, naturally, as it carries with it a handsome ‘part,’ a large\nshare in profits, his being on the spot and making a big effort for a\nbig result. That’s what I mean by his chance. If he misses it he comes\nin, as you say, for nothing. And to see that he doesn’t miss it is, in\na word, what I’ve come out for.”\n\nShe let it all sink in. “What you’ve come out for then is simply to\nrender him an immense service.”\n\nWell, poor Strether was willing to take it so. “Ah if you like.”\n\n“He stands, as they say, if you succeed with him, to gain—”\n\n“Oh a lot of advantages.” Strether had them clearly at his fingers’\nends.\n\n“By which you mean of course a lot of money.”\n\n“Well, not only. I’m acting with a sense for him of other things too.\nConsideration and comfort and security—the general safety of being\nanchored by a strong chain. He wants, as I see him, to be protected.\nProtected I mean from life.”\n\n“Ah voilà!”—her thought fitted with a click. “From life. What you\n_really_ want to get him home for is to marry him.”\n\n“Well, that’s about the size of it.”\n\n“Of course,” she said, “it’s rudimentary. But to any one in\nparticular?”\n\nHe smiled at this, looking a little more conscious. “You get everything\nout.”\n\nFor a moment again their eyes met. “You put everything in!”\n\nHe acknowledged the tribute by telling her. “To Mamie Pocock.”\n\nShe wondered; then gravely, even exquisitely, as if to make the oddity\nalso fit: “His own niece?”\n\n“Oh you must yourself find a name for the relation. His\nbrother-in-law’s sister. Mrs. Jim’s sister-in-law.”\n\nIt seemed to have on Miss Gostrey a certain hardening effect. “And who\nin the world’s Mrs. Jim?”\n\n“Chad’s sister—who was Sarah Newsome. She’s married—didn’t I mention\nit?—to Jim Pocock.”\n\n“Ah yes,” she tacitly replied; but he had mentioned things—! Then,\nhowever, with all the sound it could have, “Who in the world’s Jim\nPocock?” she asked.\n\n“Why Sally’s husband. That’s the only way we distinguish people at\nWoollett,” he good-humoredly explained.\n\n“And is it a great distinction—being Sally’s husband?”\n\nHe considered. “I think there can be scarcely a greater—unless it may\nbecome one, in the future, to be Chad’s wife.”\n\n“Then how do they distinguish _you?_”\n\n“They _don’t_—except, as I’ve told you, by the green cover.”\n\nOnce more their eyes met on it, and she held him an instant. “The green\ncover won’t—nor will _any_ cover—avail you with _me_. You’re of a depth\nof duplicity!” Still, she could in her own large grasp of the real\ncondone it. “Is Mamie a great _parti?_”\n\n“Oh the greatest we have—our prettiest brightest girl.”\n\nMiss Gostrey seemed to fix the poor child. “I know what they _can_ be.\nAnd with money?”\n\n“Not perhaps with a great deal of that—but with so much of everything\nelse that we don’t miss it. We _don’t_ miss money much, you know,”\nStrether added, “in general, in America, in pretty girls.”\n\n“No,” she conceded; “but I know also what you do sometimes miss. And do\nyou,” she asked, “yourself admire her?”\n\nIt was a question, he indicated, that there might be several ways of\ntaking; but he decided after an instant for the humorous. “Haven’t I\nsufficiently showed you how I admire _any_ pretty girl?”\n\nHer interest in his problem was by this time such that it scarce left\nher freedom, and she kept close to the facts. “I supposed that at\nWoollett you wanted them—what shall I call it?—blameless. I mean your\nyoung men for your pretty girls.”\n\n“So did I!” Strether confessed. “But you strike there a curious\nfact—the fact that Woollett too accommodates itself to the spirit of\nthe age and the increasing mildness of manners. Everything changes, and\nI hold that our situation precisely marks a date. We _should_ prefer\nthem blameless, but we have to make the best of them as we find them.\nSince the spirit of the age and the increasing mildness send them so\nmuch more to Paris—”\n\n“You’ve to take them back as they come. When they _do_ come. _Bon!_”\nOnce more she embraced it all, but she had a moment of thought. “Poor\nChad!”\n\n“Ah,” said Strether cheerfully “Mamie will save him!”\n\nShe was looking away, still in her vision, and she spoke with\nimpatience and almost as if he hadn’t understood her. “_You’ll_ save\nhim. That’s who’ll save him.”\n\n“Oh but with Mamie’s aid. Unless indeed you mean,” he added, “that I\nshall effect so much more with yours!”\n\nIt made her at last again look at him. “You’ll do more—as you’re so\nmuch better—than all of us put together.”\n\n“I think I’m only better since I’ve known _you!_” Strether bravely\nreturned.\n\nThe depletion of the place, the shrinkage of the crowd and now\ncomparatively quiet withdrawal of its last elements had already brought\nthem nearer the door and put them in relation with a messenger of whom\nhe bespoke Miss Gostrey’s cab. But this left them a few minutes more,\nwhich she was clearly in no mood not to use. “You’ve spoken to me of\nwhat—by your success—Mr. Chad stands to gain. But you’ve not spoken to\nme of what you do.”\n\n“Oh I’ve nothing more to gain,” said Strether very simply.\n\nShe took it as even quite too simple. “You mean you’ve got it all\n‘down’? You’ve been paid in advance?”\n\n“Ah don’t talk about payment!” he groaned.\n\nSomething in the tone of it pulled her up, but as their messenger still\ndelayed she had another chance and she put it in another way. “What—by\nfailure—do you stand to lose?”\n\nHe still, however, wouldn’t have it. “Nothing!” he exclaimed, and on\nthe messenger’s at this instant reappearing he was able to sink the\nsubject in their responsive advance. When, a few steps up the street,\nunder a lamp, he had put her into her four-wheeler and she had asked\nhim if the man had called for him no second conveyance, he replied\nbefore the door was closed. “You won’t take me with you?”\n\n“Not for the world.”\n\n“Then I shall walk.”\n\n“In the rain?”\n\n“I like the rain,” said Strether. “Good-night!”\n\nShe kept him a moment, while his hand was on the door, by not\nanswering; after which she answered by repeating her question. “What do\nyou stand to lose?”\n\nWhy the question now affected him as other he couldn’t have said; he\ncould only this time meet it otherwise. “Everything.”\n\n“So I thought. Then you shall succeed. And to that end I’m yours—”\n\n“Ah, dear lady!” he kindly breathed.\n\n“Till death!” said Maria Gostrey. “Good-night.”\n\n\n II\n\nStrether called, his second morning in Paris, on the bankers of the Rue\nScribe to whom his letter of credit was addressed, and he made this\nvisit attended by Waymarsh, in whose company he had crossed from London\ntwo days before. They had hastened to the Rue Scribe on the morrow of\ntheir arrival, but Strether had not then found the letters the hope of\nwhich prompted this errand. He had had as yet none at all; hadn’t\nexpected them in London, but had counted on several in Paris, and,\ndisconcerted now, had presently strolled back to the Boulevard with a\nsense of injury that he felt himself taking for as good a start as any\nother. It would serve, this spur to his spirit, he reflected, as,\npausing at the top of the street, he looked up and down the great\nforeign avenue, it would serve to begin business with. His idea was to\nbegin business immediately, and it did much for him the rest of his day\nthat the beginning of business awaited him. He did little else till\nnight but ask himself what he should do if he hadn’t fortunately had so\nmuch to do; but he put himself the question in many different\nsituations and connexions. What carried him hither and yon was an\nadmirable theory that nothing he could do wouldn’t be in some manner\nrelated to what he fundamentally had on hand, or _would_ be—should he\nhappen to have a scruple—wasted for it. He did happen to have a\nscruple—a scruple about taking no definite step till he should get\nletters; but this reasoning carried it off. A single day to feel his\nfeet—he had felt them as yet only at Chester and in London—was he could\nconsider, none too much; and having, as he had often privately\nexpressed it, Paris to reckon with, he threw these hours of freshness\nconsciously into the reckoning. They made it continually greater, but\nthat was what it had best be if it was to be anything at all, and he\ngave himself up till far into the evening, at the theatre and on the\nreturn, after the theatre, along the bright congested Boulevard, to\nfeeling it grow. Waymarsh had accompanied him this time to the play,\nand the two men had walked together, as a first stage, from the Gymnase\nto the Café Riche, into the crowded “terrace” of which\nestablishment—the night, or rather the morning, for midnight had\nstruck, being bland and populous—they had wedged themselves for\nrefreshment. Waymarsh, as a result of some discussion with his friend,\nhad made a marked virtue of his having now let himself go; and there\nhad been elements of impression in their half-hour over their watered\nbeer-glasses that gave him his occasion for conveying that he held this\ncompromise with his stiffer self to have become extreme. He conveyed\nit—for it was still, after all, his stiffer self who gloomed out of the\nglare of the terrace—in solemn silence; and there was indeed a great\ndeal of critical silence, every way, between the companions, even till\nthey gained the Place de l’Opéra, as to the character of their\nnocturnal progress.\n\nThis morning there _were_ letters—letters which had reached London,\napparently all together, the day of Strether’s journey, and had taken\ntheir time to follow him; so that, after a controlled impulse to go\ninto them in the reception-room of the bank, which, reminding him of\nthe post-office at Woollett, affected him as the abutment of some\ntransatlantic bridge, he slipped them into the pocket of his loose grey\novercoat with a sense of the felicity of carrying them off. Waymarsh,\nwho had had letters yesterday, had had them again to-day, and Waymarsh\nsuggested in this particular no controlled impulses. The last one he\nwas at all events likely to be observed to struggle with was clearly\nthat of bringing to a premature close any visit to the Rue Scribe.\nStrether had left him there yesterday; he wanted to see the papers, and\nhe had spent, by what his friend could make out, a succession of hours\nwith the papers. He spoke of the establishment, with emphasis, as a\npost of superior observation; just as he spoke generally of his actual\ndamnable doom as a device for hiding from him what was going on. Europe\nwas best described, to his mind, as an elaborate engine for\ndissociating the confined American from that indispensable knowledge,\nand was accordingly only rendered bearable by these occasional stations\nof relief, traps for the arrest of wandering western airs. Strether, on\nhis side, set himself to walk again—he had his relief in his pocket;\nand indeed, much as he had desired his budget, the growth of\nrestlessness might have been marked in him from the moment he had\nassured himself of the superscription of most of the missives it\ncontained. This restlessness became therefore his temporary law; he\nknew he should recognise as soon as see it the best place of all for\nsettling down with his chief correspondent. He had for the next hour an\naccidental air of looking for it in the windows of shops; he came down\nthe Rue de la Paix in the sun and, passing across the Tuileries and the\nriver, indulged more than once—as if on finding himself determined—in a\nsudden pause before the book-stalls of the opposite quay. In the garden\nof the Tuileries he had lingered, on two or three spots, to look; it\nwas as if the wonderful Paris spring had stayed him as he roamed. The\nprompt Paris morning struck its cheerful notes—in a soft breeze and a\nsprinkled smell, in the light flit, over the garden-floor, of\nbareheaded girls with the buckled strap of oblong boxes, in the type of\nancient thrifty persons basking betimes where terrace-walls were warm,\nin the blue-frocked brass-labelled officialism of humble rakers and\nscrapers, in the deep references of a straight-pacing priest or the\nsharp ones of a white-gaitered red-legged soldier. He watched little\nbrisk figures, figures whose movement was as the tick of the great\nParis clock, take their smooth diagonal from point to point; the air\nhad a taste as of something mixed with art, something that presented\nnature as a white-capped master-chef. The palace was gone, Strether\nremembered the palace; and when he gazed into the irremediable void of\nits site the historic sense in him might have been freely at play—the\nplay under which in Paris indeed it so often winces like a touched\nnerve. He filled out spaces with dim symbols of scenes; he caught the\ngleam of white statues at the base of which, with his letters out, he\ncould tilt back a straw-bottomed chair. But his drift was, for reasons,\nto the other side, and it floated him unspent up the Rue de Seine and\nas far as the Luxembourg. In the Luxembourg Gardens he pulled up; here\nat last he found his nook, and here, on a penny chair from which\nterraces, alleys, vistas, fountains, little trees in green tubs, little\nwomen in white caps and shrill little girls at play all sunnily\n“composed” together, he passed an hour in which the cup of his\nimpressions seemed truly to overflow. But a week had elapsed since he\nquitted the ship, and there were more things in his mind than so few\ndays could account for. More than once, during the time, he had\nregarded himself as admonished; but the admonition this morning was\nformidably sharp. It took as it hadn’t done yet the form of a\nquestion—the question of what he was doing with such an extraordinary\nsense of escape. This sense was sharpest after he had read his letters,\nbut that was also precisely why the question pressed. Four of the\nletters were from Mrs. Newsome and none of them short; she had lost no\ntime, had followed on his heels while he moved, so expressing herself\nthat he now could measure the probable frequency with which he should\nhear. They would arrive, it would seem, her communications, at the rate\nof several a week; he should be able to count, it might even prove, on\nmore than one by each mail. If he had begun yesterday with a small\ngrievance he had therefore an opportunity to begin to-day with its\nopposite. He read the letters successively and slowly, putting others\nback into his pocket but keeping these for a long time afterwards\ngathered in his lap. He held them there, lost in thought, as if to\nprolong the presence of what they gave him; or as if at the least to\nassure them their part in the constitution of some lucidity. His friend\nwrote admirably, and her tone was even more in her style than in her\nvoice—he might almost, for the hour, have had to come this distance to\nget its full carrying quality; yet the plentitude of his consciousness\nof difference consorted perfectly with the deepened intensity of the\nconnexion. It was the difference, the difference of being just where he\nwas and _as_ he was, that formed the escape—this difference was so much\ngreater than he had dreamed it would be; and what he finally sat there\nturning over was the strange logic of his finding himself so free. He\nfelt it in a manner his duty to think out his state, to approve the\nprocess, and when he came in fact to trace the steps and add up the\nitems they sufficiently accounted for the sum. He had never\nexpected—that was the truth of it—again to find himself young, and all\nthe years and other things it had taken to make him so were exactly his\npresent arithmetic. He had to make sure of them to put his scruple to\nrest.\n\nIt all sprang at bottom from the beauty of Mrs. Newsome’s desire that\nhe should be worried with nothing that was not of the essence of his\ntask; by insisting that he should thoroughly intermit and break she had\nso provided for his freedom that she would, as it were, have only\nherself to thank. Strether could not at this point indeed have\ncompleted his thought by the image of what she might have to thank\nherself _for_: the image, at best, of his own likeness—poor Lambert\nStrether washed up on the sunny strand by the waves of a single day,\npoor Lambert Strether thankful for breathing-time and stiffening\nhimself while he gasped. There he was, and with nothing in his aspect\nor his posture to scandalise: it was only true that if he had seen Mrs.\nNewsome coming he would instinctively have jumped up to walk away a\nlittle. He would have come round and back to her bravely, but he would\nhave had first to pull himself together. She abounded in news of the\nsituation at home, proved to him how perfectly she was arranging for\nhis absence, told him who would take up this and who take up that\nexactly where he had left it, gave him in fact chapter and verse for\nthe moral that nothing would suffer. It filled for him, this tone of\nhers, all the air; yet it struck him at the same time as the hum of\nvain things. This latter effect was what he tried to justify—and with\nthe success that, grave though the appearance, he at last lighted on a\nform that was happy. He arrived at it by the inevitable recognition of\nhis having been a fortnight before one of the weariest of men. If ever\na man had come off tired Lambert Strether was that man; and hadn’t it\nbeen distinctly on the ground of his fatigue that his wonderful friend\nat home had so felt for him and so contrived? It seemed to him somehow\nat these instants that, could he only maintain with sufficient firmness\nhis grasp of that truth, it might become in a manner his compass and\nhis helm. What he wanted most was some idea that would simplify, and\nnothing would do this so much as the fact that he was done for and\nfinished. If it had been in such a light that he had just detected in\nhis cup the dregs of youth, that was a mere flaw of the surface of his\nscheme. He was so distinctly fagged-out that it must serve precisely as\nhis convenience, and if he could but consistently be good for little\nenough he might do everything he wanted.\n\nEverything he wanted was comprised moreover in a single boon—the common\nunattainable art of taking things as they came. He appeared to himself\nto have given his best years to an active appreciation of the way they\ndidn’t come; but perhaps—as they would seemingly here be things quite\nother—this long ache might at last drop to rest. He could easily see\nthat from the moment he should accept the notion of his foredoomed\ncollapse the last thing he would lack would be reasons and memories. Oh\nif he _should_ do the sum no slate would hold the figures! The fact\nthat he had failed, as he considered, in everything, in each relation\nand in half a dozen trades, as he liked luxuriously to put it, might\nhave made, might still make, for an empty present; but it stood solidly\nfor a crowded past. It had not been, so much achievement missed, a\nlight yoke nor a short load. It was at present as if the backward\npicture had hung there, the long crooked course, grey in the shadow of\nhis solitude. It had been a dreadful cheerful sociable solitude, a\nsolitude of life or choice, of community; but though there had been\npeople enough all round it there had been but three or four persons\n_in_ it. Waymarsh was one of these, and the fact struck him just now as\nmarking the record. Mrs. Newsome was another, and Miss Gostrey had of a\nsudden shown signs of becoming a third. Beyond, behind them was the\npale figure of his real youth, which held against its breast the two\npresences paler than itself—the young wife he had early lost and the\nyoung son he had stupidly sacrificed. He had again and again made out\nfor himself that he might have kept his little boy, his little dull boy\nwho had died at school of rapid diphtheria, if he had not in those\nyears so insanely given himself to merely missing the mother. It was\nthe soreness of his remorse that the child had in all likelihood not\nreally been dull—had been dull, as he had been banished and neglected,\nmainly because the father had been unwittingly selfish. This was\ndoubtless but the secret habit of sorrow, which had slowly given way to\ntime; yet there remained an ache sharp enough to make the spirit, at\nthe sight now and again of some fair young man just growing up, wince\nwith the thought of an opportunity lost. Had ever a man, he had finally\nfallen into the way of asking himself, lost so much and even done so\nmuch for so little? There had been particular reasons why all\nyesterday, beyond other days, he should have had in one ear this cold\nenquiry. His name on the green cover, where he had put it for Mrs.\nNewsome, expressed him doubtless just enough to make the world—the\nworld as distinguished, both for more and for less, from Woollett—ask\nwho he was. He had incurred the ridicule of having to have his\nexplanation explained. He was Lambert Strether because he was on the\ncover, whereas it should have been, for anything like glory, that he\nwas on the cover because he was Lambert Strether. He would have done\nanything for Mrs. Newsome, have been still more ridiculous—as he might,\nfor that matter, have occasion to be yet; which came to saying that\nthis acceptance of fate was all he had to show at fifty-five.\n\nHe judged the quantity as small because it _was_ small, and all the\nmore egregiously since it couldn’t, as he saw the case, so much as\nthinkably have been larger. He hadn’t had the gift of making the most\nof what he tried, and if he had tried and tried again—no one but\nhimself knew how often—it appeared to have been that he might\ndemonstrate what else, in default of that, _could_ be made. Old ghosts\nof experiments came back to him, old drudgeries and delusions, and\ndisgusts, old recoveries with their relapses, old fevers with their\nchills, broken moments of good faith, others of still better doubt;\nadventures, for the most part, of the sort qualified as lessons. The\nspecial spring that had constantly played for him the day before was\nthe recognition—frequent enough to surprise him—of the promises to\nhimself that he had after his other visit never kept. The reminiscence\nto-day most quickened for him was that of the vow taken in the course\nof the pilgrimage that, newly-married, with the War just over, and\nhelplessly young in spite of it, he had recklessly made with the\ncreature who was so much younger still. It had been a bold dash, for\nwhich they had taken money set apart for necessities, but kept sacred\nat the moment in a hundred ways, and in none more so than by this\nprivate pledge of his own to treat the occasion as a relation formed\nwith the higher culture and see that, as they said at Woollett, it\nshould bear a good harvest. He had believed, sailing home again, that\nhe had gained something great, and his theory—with an elaborate\ninnocent plan of reading, digesting, coming back even, every few\nyears—had then been to preserve, cherish and extend it. As such plans\nas these had come to nothing, however, in respect to acquisitions still\nmore precious, it was doubtless little enough of a marvel that he\nshould have lost account of that handful of seed. Buried for long years\nin dark corners at any rate these few germs had sprouted again under\nforty-eight hours of Paris. The process of yesterday had really been\nthe process of feeling the general stirred life of connexions long\nsince individually dropped. Strether had become acquainted even on this\nground with short gusts of speculation—sudden flights of fancy in\nLouvre galleries, hungry gazes through clear plates behind which\nlemon-coloured volumes were as fresh as fruit on the tree.\n\nThere were instants at which he could ask whether, since there had been\nfundamentally so little question of his keeping anything, the fate\nafter all decreed for him hadn’t been only to _be_ kept. Kept for\nsomething, in that event, that he didn’t pretend, didn’t possibly dare\nas yet to divine; something that made him hover and wonder and laugh\nand sigh, made him advance and retreat, feeling half ashamed of his\nimpulse to plunge and more than half afraid of his impulse to wait. He\nremembered for instance how he had gone back in the sixties with\nlemon-coloured volumes in general on the brain as well as with a\ndozen—selected for his wife too—in his trunk; and nothing had at the\nmoment shown more confidence than this invocation of the finer taste.\nThey were still somewhere at home, the dozen—stale and soiled and never\nsent to the binder; but what had become of the sharp initiation they\nrepresented? They represented now the mere sallow paint on the door of\nthe temple of taste that he had dreamed of raising up—a structure he\nhad practically never carried further. Strether’s present highest\nflights were perhaps those in which this particular lapse figured to\nhim as a symbol, a symbol of his long grind and his want of odd\nmoments, his want moreover of money, of opportunity, of positive\ndignity. That the memory of the vow of his youth should, in order to\nthrob again, have had to wait for this last, as he felt it, of all his\naccidents—that was surely proof enough of how his conscience had been\nencumbered. If any further proof were needed it would have been to be\nfound in the fact that, as he perfectly now saw, he had ceased even to\nmeasure his meagreness, a meagreness that sprawled, in this retrospect,\nvague and comprehensive, stretching back like some unmapped Hinterland\nfrom a rough coast-settlement. His conscience had been amusing itself\nfor the forty-eight hours by forbidding him the purchase of a book; he\nheld off from that, held off from everything; from the moment he didn’t\nyet call on Chad he wouldn’t for the world have taken any other step.\nOn this evidence, however, of the way they actually affected him he\nglared at the lemon-coloured covers in confession of the\nsubconsciousness that, all the same, in the great desert of the years,\nhe must have had of them. The green covers at home comprised, by the\nlaw of their purpose, no tribute to letters; it was of a mere rich\nkernel of economics, politics, ethics that, glazed and, as Mrs. Newsome\nmaintained rather against _his_ view, pre-eminently pleasant to touch,\nthey formed the specious shell. Without therefore any needed\ninstinctive knowledge of what was coming out, in Paris, on the bright\nhighway, he struck himself at present as having more than once flushed\nwith a suspicion: he couldn’t otherwise at present be feeling so many\nfears confirmed. There were “movements” he was too late for: weren’t\nthey, with the fun of them, already spent? There were sequences he had\nmissed and great gaps in the procession: he might have been watching it\nall recede in a golden cloud of dust. If the playhouse wasn’t closed\nhis seat had at least fallen to somebody else. He had had an uneasy\nfeeling the night before that if he was at the theatre at all—though he\nindeed justified the theatre, in the specific sense, and with a\ngrotesqueness to which his imagination did all honour, as something he\nowed poor Waymarsh—he should have been there with, and as might have\nbeen said, _for_ Chad.\n\nThis suggested the question of whether he could properly have taken him\nto such a play, and what effect—it was a point that suddenly rose—his\npeculiar responsibility might be held in general to have on his choice\nof entertainment. It had literally been present to him at the\nGymnase—where one was held moreover comparatively safe—that having his\nyoung friend at his side would have been an odd feature of the work of\nredemption; and this quite in spite of the fact that the picture\npresented might well, confronted with Chad’s own private stage, have\nseemed the pattern of propriety. He clearly hadn’t come out in the name\nof propriety but to visit unattended equivocal performances; yet still\nless had he done so to undermine his authority by sharing them with the\ngraceless youth. Was he to renounce all amusement for the sweet sake of\nthat authority? and _would_ such renouncement give him for Chad a moral\nglamour? The little problem bristled the more by reason of poor\nStrether’s fairly open sense of the irony of things. Were there then\nsides on which his predicament threatened to look rather droll to him?\nShould he have to pretend to believe—either to himself or the wretched\nboy—that there was anything that could make the latter worse? Wasn’t\nsome such pretence on the other hand involved in the assumption of\npossible processes that would make him better? His greatest uneasiness\nseemed to peep at him out of the imminent impression that almost any\nacceptance of Paris might give one’s authority away. It hung before him\nthis morning, the vast bright Babylon, like some huge iridescent\nobject, a jewel brilliant and hard, in which parts were not to be\ndiscriminated nor differences comfortably marked. It twinkled and\ntrembled and melted together, and what seemed all surface one moment\nseemed all depth the next. It was a place of which, unmistakeably, Chad\nwas fond; wherefore if he, Strether, should like it too much, what on\nearth, with such a bond, would become of either of them? It all\ndepended of course—which was a gleam of light—on how the “too much” was\nmeasured; though indeed our friend fairly felt, while he prolonged the\nmeditation I describe, that for himself even already a certain measure\nhad been reached. It will have been sufficiently seen that he was not a\nman to neglect any good chance for reflexion. Was it at all possible\nfor instance to like Paris enough without liking it too much? He\nluckily however hadn’t promised Mrs. Newsome not to like it at all. He\nwas ready to recognise at this stage that such an engagement _would_\nhave tied his hands. The Luxembourg Gardens were incontestably just so\nadorable at this hour by reason—in addition to their intrinsic charm—of\nhis not having taken it. The only engagement he had taken, when he\nlooked the thing in the face, was to do what he reasonably could.\n\nIt upset him a little none the less and after a while to find himself\nat last remembering on what current of association he had been floated\nso far. Old imaginations of the Latin Quarter had played their part for\nhim, and he had duly recalled its having been with this scene of rather\nominous legend that, like so many young men in fiction as well as in\nfact, Chad had begun. He was now quite out of it, with his “home,” as\nStrether figured the place, in the Boulevard Malesherbes, now; which\nwas perhaps why, repairing, not to fail of justice either, to the elder\nneighbourhood, our friend had felt he could allow for the element of\nthe usual, the immemorial, without courting perturbation. He was not at\nleast in danger of seeing the youth and the particular Person flaunt by\ntogether; and yet he was in the very air of which—just to feel what the\nearly natural note must have been—he wished most to take counsel. It\nbecame at once vivid to him that he had originally had, for a few days,\nan almost envious vision of the boy’s romantic privilege. Melancholy\nMürger, with Francine and Musette and Rodolphe, at home, was, in the\ncompany of the tattered, one—if he not in his single self two or\nthree—of the unbound, the paper-covered dozen on the shelf; and when\nChad had written, five years ago, after a sojourn then already\nprolonged to six months, that he had decided to go in for economy and\nthe real thing, Strether’s fancy had quite fondly accompanied him in\nthis migration, which was to convey him, as they somewhat confusedly\nlearned at Woollett, across the bridges and up the Montagne\nSainte-Geneviève. This was the region—Chad had been quite distinct\nabout it—in which the best French, and many other things, were to be\nlearned at least cost, and in which all sorts of clever fellows,\ncompatriots there for a purpose, formed an awfully pleasant set. The\nclever fellows, the friendly countrymen were mainly young painters,\nsculptors, architects, medical students; but they were, Chad sagely\nopined, a much more profitable lot to be with—even on the footing of\nnot being quite one of them—than the “terrible toughs” (Strether\nremembered the edifying discrimination) of the American bars and banks\nroundabout the Opéra. Chad had thrown out, in the communications\nfollowing this one—for at that time he did once in a while\ncommunicate—that several members of a band of earnest workers under one\nof the great artists had taken him right in, making him dine every\nnight, almost for nothing, at their place, and even pressing him not to\nneglect the hypothesis of there being as much “in him” as in any of\nthem. There had been literally a moment at which it appeared there\nmight be something in him; there had been at any rate a moment at which\nhe had written that he didn’t know but what a month or two more might\nsee him enrolled in some _atelier_. The season had been one at which\nMrs. Newsome was moved to gratitude for small mercies; it had broken on\nthem all as a blessing that their absentee _had_ perhaps a\nconscience—that he was sated in fine with idleness, was ambitious of\nvariety. The exhibition was doubtless as yet not brilliant, but\nStrether himself, even by that time much enlisted and immersed, had\ndetermined, on the part of the two ladies, a temperate approval and in\nfact, as he now recollected, a certain austere enthusiasm.\n\nBut the very next thing that happened had been a dark drop of the\ncurtain. The son and brother had not browsed long on the Montagne\nSainte-Geneviève—his effective little use of the name of which, like\nhis allusion to the best French, appeared to have been but one of the\nnotes of his rough cunning. The light refreshment of these vain\nappearances had not accordingly carried any of them very far. On the\nother hand it had gained Chad time; it had given him a chance,\nunchecked, to strike his roots, had paved the way for initiations more\ndirect and more deep. It was Strether’s belief that he had been\ncomparatively innocent before this first migration, and even that the\nfirst effects of the migration would not have been, without some\nparticular bad accident, to have been deplored. There had been three\nmonths—he had sufficiently figured it out—in which Chad had wanted to\ntry. He _had_ tried, though not very hard—he had had his little hour of\ngood faith. The weakness of this principle in him was that almost any\naccident attestedly bad enough was stronger. Such had at any rate\nmarkedly been the case for the precipitation of a special series of\nimpressions. They had proved, successively, these impressions—all of\nMusette and Francine, but Musette and Francine vulgarised by the larger\nevolution of the type—irresistibly sharp: he had “taken up,” by what\nwas at the time to be shrinkingly gathered, as it was scantly\nmentioned, with one ferociously “interested” little person after\nanother. Strether had read somewhere of a Latin motto, a description of\nthe hours, observed on a clock by a traveller in Spain; and he had been\nled to apply it in thought to Chad’s number one, number two, number\nthree. _Omnes vulnerant, ultima necat_—they had all morally wounded,\nthe last had morally killed. The last had been longest in possession—in\npossession, that is, of whatever was left of the poor boy’s finer\nmortality. And it hadn’t been she, it had been one of her early\npredecessors, who had determined the second migration, the expensive\nreturn and relapse, the exchange again, as was fairly to be presumed,\nof the vaunted best French for some special variety of the worst.\n\nHe pulled himself then at last together for his own progress back; not\nwith the feeling that he had taken his walk in vain. He prolonged it a\nlittle, in the immediate neighbourhood, after he had quitted his chair;\nand the upshot of the whole morning for him was that his campaign had\nbegun. He had wanted to put himself in relation, and he would be hanged\nif he were _not_ in relation. He was that at no moment so much as\nwhile, under the old arches of the Odéon, he lingered before the\ncharming open-air array of literature classic and casual. He found the\neffect of tone and tint, in the long charged tables and shelves,\ndelicate and appetising; the impression—substituting one kind of\nlow-priced _consommation_ for another—might have been that of one of\nthe pleasant cafés that overlapped, under an awning, to the pavement;\nbut he edged along, grazing the tables, with his hands firmly behind\nhim. He wasn’t there to dip, to consume—he was there to reconstruct. He\nwasn’t there for his own profit—not, that is, the direct; he was there\non some chance of feeling the brush of the wing of the stray spirit of\nyouth. He felt it in fact, he had it beside him; the old arcade indeed,\nas his inner sense listened, gave out the faint sound, as from far off,\nof the wild waving of wings. They were folded now over the breasts of\nburied generations; but a flutter or two lived again in the turned page\nof shock-headed slouch-hatted loiterers whose young intensity of type,\nin the direction of pale acuteness, deepened his vision, and even his\nappreciation, of racial differences, and whose manipulation of the\nuncut volume was too often, however, but a listening at closed doors.\nHe reconstructed a possible groping Chad of three or four years before,\na Chad who had, after all, simply—for that was the only way to see\nit—been too vulgar for his privilege. Surely it _was_ a privilege to\nhave been young and happy just there. Well, the best thing Strether\nknew of him was that he had had such a dream.\n\nBut his own actual business, half an hour later, was with a third floor\non the Boulevard Malesherbes—so much as that was definite; and the fact\nof the enjoyment by the third-floor windows of a continuous balcony, to\nwhich he was helped by this knowledge, had perhaps something to do with\nhis lingering for five minutes on the opposite side of the street.\nThere were points as to which he had quite made up his mind, and one of\nthese bore precisely on the wisdom of the abruptness to which events\nhad finally committed him, a policy that he was pleased to find not at\nall shaken as he now looked at his watch and wondered. He _had_\nannounced himself—six months before; had written out at least that Chad\nwasn’t to be surprised should he see him some day turn up. Chad had\nthereupon, in a few words of rather carefully colourless answer,\noffered him a general welcome; and Strether, ruefully reflecting that\nhe might have understood the warning as a hint to hospitality, a bid\nfor an invitation, had fallen back upon silence as the corrective most\nto his own taste. He had asked Mrs. Newsome moreover not to announce\nhim again; he had so distinct an opinion on his attacking his job,\nshould he attack it at all, in his own way. Not the least of this\nlady’s high merits for him was that he could absolutely rest on her\nword. She was the only woman he had known, even at Woollett, as to whom\nhis conviction was positive that to lie was beyond her art. Sarah\nPocock, for instance, her own daughter, though with social ideals, as\nthey said, in some respects different—Sarah who _was_, in her way,\næsthetic, had never refused to human commerce that mitigation of\nrigour; there were occasions when he had distinctly seen her apply it.\nSince, accordingly, at all events, he had had it from Mrs. Newsome that\nshe had, at whatever cost to her more strenuous view, conformed, in the\nmatter of preparing Chad, wholly to his restrictions, he now looked up\nat the fine continuous balcony with a safe sense that if the case had\nbeen bungled the mistake was at least his property. Was there perhaps\njust a suspicion of that in his present pause on the edge of the\nBoulevard and well in the pleasant light?\n\nMany things came over him here, and one of them was that he should\ndoubtless presently know whether he had been shallow or sharp. Another\nwas that the balcony in question didn’t somehow show as a convenience\neasy to surrender. Poor Strether had at this very moment to recognise\nthe truth that wherever one paused in Paris the imagination reacted\nbefore one could stop it. This perpetual reaction put a price, if one\nwould, on pauses; but it piled up consequences till there was scarce\nroom to pick one’s steps among them. What call had he, at such a\njuncture, for example, to like Chad’s very house? High broad clear—he\nwas expert enough to make out in a moment that it was admirably\nbuilt—it fairly embarrassed our friend by the quality that, as he would\nhave said, it “sprang” on him. He had struck off the fancy that it\nmight, as a preliminary, be of service to him to be seen, by a happy\naccident, from the third-story windows, which took all the March sun,\nbut of what service was it to find himself making out after a moment\nthat the quality “sprung,” the quality produced by measure and balance,\nthe fine relation of part to part and space to space, was\nprobably—aided by the presence of ornament as positive as it was\ndiscreet, and by the complexion of the stone, a cold fair grey, warmed\nand polished a little by life—neither more nor less than a case of\ndistinction, such a case as he could only feel unexpectedly as a sort\nof delivered challenge? Meanwhile, however, the chance he had allowed\nfor—the chance of being seen in time from the balcony—had become a\nfact. Two or three of the windows stood open to the violet air; and,\nbefore Strether had cut the knot by crossing, a young man had come out\nand looked about him, had lighted a cigarette and tossed the match\nover, and then, resting on the rail, had given himself up to watching\nthe life below while he smoked. His arrival contributed, in its order,\nto keeping Strether in position; the result of which in turn was that\nStrether soon felt himself noticed. The young man began to look at him\nas in acknowledgement of his being himself in observation.\n\nThis was interesting so far as it went, but the interest was affected\nby the young man’s not being Chad. Strether wondered at first if he\nwere perhaps Chad altered, and then saw that this was asking too much\nof alteration. The young man was light bright and alert—with an air too\npleasant to have been arrived at by patching. Strether had conceived\nChad as patched, but not beyond recognition. He was in presence, he\nfelt, of amendments enough as they stood; it was a sufficient amendment\nthat the gentleman up there should be Chad’s friend. He was young too\nthen, the gentleman up there—he was very young; young enough apparently\nto be amused at an elderly watcher, to be curious even to see what the\nelderly watcher would do on finding himself watched. There was youth in\nthat, there was youth in the surrender to the balcony, there was youth\nfor Strether at this moment in everything but his own business; and\nChad’s thus pronounced association with youth had given the next\ninstant an extraordinary quick lift to the issue. The balcony, the\ndistinguished front, testified suddenly, for Strether’s fancy, to\nsomething that was up and up; they placed the whole case materially,\nand as by an admirable image, on a level that he found himself at the\nend of another moment rejoicing to think he might reach. The young man\nlooked at him still, he looked at the young man; and the issue, by a\nrapid process, was that this knowledge of a perched privacy appeared to\nhim the last of luxuries. To him too the perched privacy was open, and\nhe saw it now but in one light—that of the only domicile, the only\nfireside, in the great ironic city, on which he had the shadow of a\nclaim. Miss Gostrey had a fireside; she had told him of it, and it was\nsomething that doubtless awaited him; but Miss Gostrey hadn’t yet\narrived—she mightn’t arrive for days; and the sole attenuation of his\nexcluded state was his vision of the small, the admittedly secondary\nhotel in the bye-street from the Rue de la Paix, in which her\nsolicitude for his purse had placed him, which affected him somehow as\nall indoor chill, glass-roofed court and slippery staircase, and which,\nby the same token, expressed the presence of Waymarsh even at times\nwhen Waymarsh might have been certain to be round at the bank. It came\nto pass before he moved that Waymarsh, and Waymarsh alone, Waymarsh not\nonly undiluted but positively strengthened, struck him as the present\nalternative to the young man in the balcony. When he did move it was\nfairly to escape that alternative. Taking his way over the street at\nlast and passing through the _porte-cochère_ of the house was like\nconsciously leaving Waymarsh out. However, he would tell him all about\nit.\n\n\nBook Third\n\n\n I\n\nStrether told Waymarsh all about it that very evening, on their dining\ntogether at the hotel; which needn’t have happened, he was all the\nwhile aware, hadn’t he chosen to sacrifice to this occasion a rarer\nopportunity. The mention to his companion of the sacrifice was moreover\nexactly what introduced his recital—or, as he would have called it with\nmore confidence in his interlocutor, his confession. His confession was\nthat he had been captured and that one of the features of the affair\nhad just failed to be his engaging himself on the spot to dinner. As by\nsuch a freedom Waymarsh would have lost him he had obeyed his scruple;\nand he had likewise obeyed another scruple—which bore on the question\nof his himself bringing a guest.\n\nWaymarsh looked gravely ardent, over the finished soup, at this array\nof scruples; Strether hadn’t yet got quite used to being so unprepared\nfor the consequences of the impression he produced. It was\ncomparatively easy to explain, however, that he hadn’t felt sure his\nguest would please. The person was a young man whose acquaintance he\nhad made but that afternoon in the course of rather a hindered enquiry\nfor another person—an enquiry his new friend had just prevented in fact\nfrom being vain. “Oh,” said Strether, “I’ve all sorts of things to tell\nyou!”—and he put it in a way that was a virtual hint to Waymarsh to\nhelp him to enjoy the telling. He waited for his fish, he drank of his\nwine, he wiped his long moustache, he leaned back in his chair, he took\nin the two English ladies who had just creaked past them and whom he\nwould even have articulately greeted if they hadn’t rather chilled the\nimpulse; so that all he could do was—by way of doing something—to say\n“Merci, François!” out quite loud when his fish was brought. Everything\nwas there that he wanted, everything that could make the moment an\noccasion, that would do beautifully—everything but what Waymarsh might\ngive. The little waxed salle-à-manger was sallow and sociable;\nFrançois, dancing over it, all smiles, was a man and a brother; the\nhigh-shouldered patronne, with her high-held, much-rubbed hands, seemed\nalways assenting exuberantly to something unsaid; the Paris evening in\nshort was, for Strether, in the very taste of the soup, in the\ngoodness, as he was innocently pleased to think it, of the wine, in the\npleasant coarse texture of the napkin and the crunch of the\nthick-crusted bread. These all were things congruous with his\nconfession, and his confession was that he _had_—it would come out\nproperly just there if Waymarsh would only take it properly—agreed to\nbreakfast out, at twelve literally, the next day. He didn’t quite know\nwhere; the delicacy of the case came straight up in the remembrance of\nhis new friend’s “We’ll see; I’ll take you somewhere!”—for it had\nrequired little more than that, after all, to let him right in. He was\naffected after a minute, face to face with his actual comrade, by the\nimpulse to overcolour. There had already been things in respect to\nwhich he knew himself tempted by this perversity. If Waymarsh thought\nthem bad he should at least have his reason for his discomfort; so\nStrether showed them as worse. Still, he was now, in his way, sincerely\nperplexed.\n\nChad had been absent from the Boulevard Malesherbes—was absent from\nParis altogether; he had learned that from the concierge, but had\nnevertheless gone up, and gone up—there were no two ways about it—from\nan uncontrollable, a really, if one would, depraved curiosity. The\nconcierge had mentioned to him that a friend of the tenant of the\ntroisième was for the time in possession; and this had been Strether’s\npretext for a further enquiry, an experiment carried on, under Chad’s\nroof, without his knowledge. “I found his friend in fact there keeping\nthe place warm, as he called it, for him; Chad himself being, as\nappears, in the south. He went a month ago to Cannes and though his\nreturn begins to be looked for it can’t be for some days. I might, you\nsee, perfectly have waited a week; might have beaten a retreat as soon\nas I got this essential knowledge. But I beat no retreat; I did the\nopposite; I stayed, I dawdled, I trifled; above all I looked round. I\nsaw, in fine; and—I don’t know what to call it—I sniffed. It’s a\ndetail, but it’s as if there were something—something very good—_to_\nsniff.”\n\nWaymarsh’s face had shown his friend an attention apparently so remote\nthat the latter was slightly surprised to find it at this point abreast\nwith him. “Do you mean a smell? What of?”\n\n“A charming scent. But I don’t know.”\n\nWaymarsh gave an inferential grunt. “Does he live there with a woman?”\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\nWaymarsh waited an instant for more, then resumed. “Has he taken her\noff with him?”\n\n“And will he bring her back?”—Strether fell into the enquiry. But he\nwound it up as before. “I don’t know.”\n\nThe way he wound it up, accompanied as this was with another drop back,\nanother degustation of the Léoville, another wipe of his moustache and\nanother good word for François, seemed to produce in his companion a\nslight irritation. “Then what the devil _do_ you know?”\n\n“Well,” said Strether almost gaily, “I guess I don’t know anything!”\nHis gaiety might have been a tribute to the fact that the state he had\nbeen reduced to did for him again what had been done by his talk of the\nmatter with Miss Gostrey at the London theatre. It was somehow\nenlarging; and the air of that amplitude was now doubtless more or\nless—and all for Waymarsh to feel—in his further response. “That’s what\nI found out from the young man.”\n\n“But I thought you said you found out nothing.”\n\n“Nothing but that—that I don’t know anything.”\n\n“And what good does that do you?”\n\n“It’s just,” said Strether, “what I’ve come to you to help me to\ndiscover. I mean anything about anything over here. I _felt_ that, up\nthere. It regularly rose before me in its might. The young man\nmoreover—Chad’s friend—as good as told me so.”\n\n“As good as told you you know nothing about anything?” Waymarsh\nappeared to look at some one who might have as good as told _him_. “How\nold is he?”\n\n“Well, I guess not thirty.”\n\n“Yet you had to take that from him?”\n\n“Oh I took a good deal more—since, as I tell you, I took an invitation\nto déjeuner.”\n\n“And are you _going_ to that unholy meal?”\n\n“If you’ll come with me. He wants you too, you know. I told him about\nyou. He gave me his card,” Strether pursued, “and his name’s rather\nfunny. It’s John Little Bilham, and he says his two surnames are, on\naccount of his being small, inevitably used together.”\n\n“Well,” Waymarsh asked with due detachment from these details, “what’s\nhe doing up there?”\n\n“His account of himself is that he’s ‘only a little artist-man.’ That\nseemed to me perfectly to describe him. But he’s yet in the phase of\nstudy; this, you know, is the great art-school—to pass a certain number\nof years in which he came over. And he’s a great friend of Chad’s, and\noccupying Chad’s rooms just now because they’re so pleasant. _He’s_\nvery pleasant and curious too,” Strether added—“though he’s not from\nBoston.”\n\nWaymarsh looked already rather sick of him. “Where _is_ he from?”\n\nStrether thought. “I don’t know that, either. But he’s ‘notoriously,’\nas he put it himself, not from Boston.”\n\n“Well,” Waymarsh moralised from dry depths, “every one can’t\nnotoriously _be_ from Boston. Why,” he continued, “is he curious?”\n\n“Perhaps just for _that_—for one thing! But really,” Strether added,\n“for everything. When you meet him you’ll see.”\n\n“Oh I don’t want to meet him,” Waymarsh impatiently growled. “Why don’t\nhe go home?”\n\nStrether hesitated. “Well, because he likes it over here.”\n\nThis appeared in particular more than Waymarsh could bear. “He ought\nthen to be ashamed of himself, and, as you admit that you think so too,\nwhy drag him in?”\n\nStrether’s reply again took time. “Perhaps I do think so myself—though\nI don’t quite yet admit it. I’m not a bit sure—it’s again one of the\nthings I want to find out. I liked him, and _can_ you like people—? But\nno matter.” He pulled himself up. “There’s no doubt I want you to come\ndown on me and squash me.”\n\nWaymarsh helped himself to the next course, which, however proving not\nthe dish he had just noted as supplied to the English ladies, had the\neffect of causing his imagination temporarily to wander. But it\npresently broke out at a softer spot. “Have they got a handsome place\nup there?”\n\n“Oh a charming place; full of beautiful and valuable things. I never\nsaw such a place”—and Strether’s thought went back to it. “For a little\nartist-man—!” He could in fact scarce express it.\n\nBut his companion, who appeared now to have a view, insisted. “Well?”\n\n“Well, life can hold nothing better. Besides, they’re things of which\nhe’s in charge.”\n\n“So that he does doorkeeper for your precious pair? Can life,” Waymarsh\nenquired, “hold nothing better than _that?_” Then as Strether, silent,\nseemed even yet to wonder, “Doesn’t he know what _she_ is?” he went on.\n\n“_I_ don’t know. I didn’t ask him. I couldn’t. It was impossible. You\nwouldn’t either. Besides I didn’t want to. No more would you.” Strether\nin short explained it at a stroke. “You can’t make out over here what\npeople do know.”\n\n“Then what did you come over for?”\n\n“Well, I suppose exactly to see for myself—without their aid.”\n\n“Then what do you want mine for?”\n\n“Oh,” Strether laughed, “you’re not one of _them!_ I do know what _you_\nknow.”\n\nAs, however, this last assertion caused Waymarsh again to look at him\nhard—such being the latter’s doubt of its implications—he felt his\njustification lame. Which was still more the case when Waymarsh\npresently said: “Look here, Strether. Quit this.”\n\nOur friend smiled with a doubt of his own. “Do you mean my tone?”\n\n“No—damn your tone. I mean your nosing round. Quit the whole job. Let\nthem stew in their juice. You’re being used for a thing you ain’t fit\nfor. People don’t take a fine-tooth comb to groom a horse.”\n\n“Am I a fine-tooth comb?” Strether laughed. “It’s something I never\ncalled myself!”\n\n“It’s what you are, all the same. You ain’t so young as you were, but\nyou’ve kept your teeth.”\n\nHe acknowledged his friend’s humour. “Take care I don’t get them into\n_you!_ You’d like them, my friends at home, Waymarsh,” he declared;\n“you’d really particularly like them. And I know”—it was slightly\nirrelevant, but he gave it sudden and singular force—“I know they’d\nlike you!”\n\n“Oh don’t work them off on _me!_” Waymarsh groaned.\n\nYet Strether still lingered with his hands in his pockets. “It’s really\nquite as indispensable as I say that Chad should be got back.”\n\n“Indispensable to whom? To you?”\n\n“Yes,” Strether presently said.\n\n“Because if you get him you also get Mrs. Newsome?”\n\nStrether faced it. “Yes.”\n\n“And if you don’t get him you don’t get her?”\n\nIt might be merciless, but he continued not to flinch. “I think it\nmight have some effect on our personal understanding. Chad’s of real\nimportance—or can easily become so if he will—to the business.”\n\n“And the business is of real importance to his mother’s husband?”\n\n“Well, I naturally want what my future wife wants. And the thing will\nbe much better if we have our own man in it.”\n\n“If you have your own man in it, in other words,” Waymarsh said,\n“you’ll marry—you personally—more money. She’s already rich, as I\nunderstand you, but she’ll be richer still if the business can be made\nto boom on certain lines that you’ve laid down.”\n\n“_I_ haven’t laid them down,” Strether promptly returned. “Mr.\nNewsome—who knew extraordinarily well what he was about—laid them down\nten years ago.”\n\nOh well, Waymarsh seemed to indicate with a shake of his mane, _that_\ndidn’t matter! “You’re fierce for the boom anyway.”\n\nHis friend weighed a moment in silence the justice of the charge. “I\ncan scarcely be called fierce, I think, when I so freely take my chance\nof the possibility, the danger, of being influenced in a sense counter\nto Mrs. Newsome’s own feelings.”\n\nWaymarsh gave this proposition a long hard look. “I see. You’re afraid\nyourself of being squared. But you’re a humbug,” he added, “all the\nsame.”\n\n“Oh!” Strether quickly protested.\n\n“Yes, you ask me for protection—which makes you very interesting; and\nthen you won’t take it. You say you want to be squashed—”\n\n“Ah but not so easily! Don’t you see,” Strether demanded “where my\ninterest, as already shown you, lies? It lies in my not being squared.\nIf I’m squared where’s my marriage? If I miss my errand I miss that;\nand if I miss that I miss everything—I’m nowhere.”\n\nWaymarsh—but all relentlessly—took this in. “What do I care where you\nare if you’re spoiled?”\n\nTheir eyes met on it an instant. “Thank you awfully,” Strether at last\nsaid. “But don’t you think _her_ judgement of that—?”\n\n“Ought to content me? No.”\n\nIt kept them again face to face, and the end of this was that Strether\nagain laughed. “You do her injustice. You really _must_ know her.\nGood-night.”\n\nHe breakfasted with Mr. Bilham on the morrow, and, as inconsequently\nbefell, with Waymarsh massively of the party. The latter announced, at\nthe eleventh hour and much to his friend’s surprise, that, damn it, he\nwould as soon join him as do anything else; on which they proceeded\ntogether, strolling in a state of detachment practically luxurious for\nthem to the Boulevard Malesherbes, a couple engaged that day with the\nsharp spell of Paris as confessedly, it might have been seen, as any\ncouple among the daily thousands so compromised. They walked, wandered,\nwondered and, a little, lost themselves; Strether hadn’t had for years\nso rich a consciousness of time—a bag of gold into which he constantly\ndipped for a handful. It was present to him that when the little\nbusiness with Mr. Bilham should be over he would still have shining\nhours to use absolutely as he liked. There was no great pulse of haste\nyet in this process of saving Chad; nor was that effect a bit more\nmarked as he sat, half an hour later, with his legs under Chad’s\nmahogany, with Mr. Bilham on one side, with a friend of Mr. Bilham’s on\nthe other, with Waymarsh stupendously opposite, and with the great hum\nof Paris coming up in softness, vagueness—for Strether himself indeed\nalready positive sweetness—through the sunny windows toward which, the\nday before, his curiosity had raised its wings from below. The feeling\nstrongest with him at that moment had borne fruit almost faster than he\ncould taste it, and Strether literally felt at the present hour that\nthere was a precipitation in his fate. He had known nothing and nobody\nas he stood in the street; but hadn’t his view now taken a bound in the\ndirection of every one and of every thing?\n\n“What’s he up to, what’s he up to?”—something like that was at the back\nof his head all the while in respect to little Bilham; but meanwhile,\ntill he should make out, every one and every thing were as good as\nrepresented for him by the combination of his host and the lady on his\nleft. The lady on his left, the lady thus promptly and ingeniously\ninvited to “meet” Mr. Strether and Mr. Waymarsh—it was the way she\nherself expressed her case—was a very marked person, a person who had\nmuch to do with our friend’s asking himself if the occasion weren’t in\nits essence the most baited, the most gilded of traps. Baited it could\nproperly be called when the repast was of so wise a savour, and gilded\nsurrounding objects seemed inevitably to need to be when Miss\nBarrace—which was the lady’s name—looked at them with convex Parisian\neyes and through a glass with a remarkably long tortoise-shell handle.\nWhy Miss Barrace, mature meagre erect and eminently gay, highly\nadorned, perfectly familiar, freely contradictious and reminding him of\nsome last-century portrait of a clever head without powder—why Miss\nBarrace should have been in particular the note of a “trap” Strether\ncouldn’t on the spot have explained; he blinked in the light of a\nconviction that he should know later on, and know well—as it came over\nhim, for that matter, with force, that he should need to. He wondered\nwhat he was to think exactly of either of his new friends; since the\nyoung man, Chad’s intimate and deputy, had, in thus constituting the\nscene, practised so much more subtly than he had been prepared for, and\nsince in especial Miss Barrace, surrounded clearly by every\nconsideration, hadn’t scrupled to figure as a familiar object. It was\ninteresting to him to feel that he was in the presence of new measures,\nother standards, a different scale of relations, and that evidently\nhere were a happy pair who didn’t think of things at all as he and\nWaymarsh thought. Nothing was less to have been calculated in the\nbusiness than that it should now be for him as if he and Waymarsh were\ncomparatively quite at one.\n\nThe latter was magnificent—this at least was an assurance privately\ngiven him by Miss Barrace. “Oh your friend’s a type, the grand old\nAmerican—what shall one call it? The Hebrew prophet, Ezekiel, Jeremiah,\nwho used when I was a little girl in the Rue Montaigne to come to see\nmy father and who was usually the American Minister to the Tuileries or\nsome other court. I haven’t seen one these ever so many years; the\nsight of it warms my poor old chilled heart; this specimen is\nwonderful; in the right quarter, you know, he’ll have a _succès fou_.”\nStrether hadn’t failed to ask what the right quarter might be, much as\nhe required his presence of mind to meet such a change in their scheme.\n“Oh the artist-quarter and that kind of thing; _here_ already, for\ninstance, as you see.” He had been on the point of echoing “‘Here’?—is\n_this_ the artist-quarter?” but she had already disposed of the\nquestion with a wave of all her tortoise-shell and an easy “Bring him\nto _me!_” He knew on the spot how little he should be able to bring\nhim, for the very air was by this time, to his sense, thick and hot\nwith poor Waymarsh’s judgement of it. He was in the trap still more\nthan his companion and, unlike his companion, not making the best of\nit; which was precisely what doubtless gave him his admirable sombre\nglow. Little did Miss Barrace know that what was behind it was his\ngrave estimate of her own laxity. The general assumption with which our\ntwo friends had arrived had been that of finding Mr. Bilham ready to\nconduct them to one or other of those resorts of the earnest, the\næsthetic fraternity which were shown among the sights of Paris. In this\ncharacter it would have justified them in a proper insistence on\ndischarging their score. Waymarsh’s only proviso at the last had been\nthat nobody should pay for him; but he found himself, as the occasion\ndeveloped, paid for on a scale as to which Strether privately made out\nthat he already nursed retribution. Strether was conscious across the\ntable of what worked in him, conscious when they passed back to the\nsmall salon to which, the previous evening, he himself had made so rich\na reference; conscious most of all as they stepped out to the balcony\nin which one would have had to be an ogre not to recognise the perfect\nplace for easy aftertastes. These things were enhanced for Miss Barrace\nby a succession of excellent cigarettes—acknowledged, acclaimed, as a\npart of the wonderful supply left behind him by Chad—in an almost equal\nabsorption of which Strether found himself blindly, almost wildly\npushing forward. He might perish by the sword as well as by famine, and\nhe knew that his having abetted the lady by an excess that was rare\nwith him would count for little in the sum—as Waymarsh might so easily\nadd it up—of her licence. Waymarsh had smoked of old, smoked hugely;\nbut Waymarsh did nothing now, and that gave him his advantage over\npeople who took things up lightly just when others had laid them\nheavily down. Strether had never smoked, and he felt as if he flaunted\nat his friend that this had been only because of a reason. The reason,\nit now began to appear even to himself, was that he had never had a\nlady to smoke with.\n\nIt was this lady’s being there at all, however, that was the strange\nfree thing; perhaps, since she _was_ there, her smoking was the least\nof her freedoms. If Strether had been sure at each juncture of\nwhat—with Bilham in especial—she talked about, he might have traced\nothers and winced at them and felt Waymarsh wince; but he was in fact\nso often at sea that his sense of the range of reference was merely\ngeneral and that he on several different occasions guessed and\ninterpreted only to doubt. He wondered what they meant, but there were\nthings he scarce thought they could be supposed to mean, and “Oh no—not\n_that!_” was at the end of most of his ventures. This was the very\nbeginning with him of a condition as to which, later on, it will be\nseen, he found cause to pull himself up; and he was to remember the\nmoment duly as the first step in a process. The central fact of the\nplace was neither more nor less, when analysed—and a pressure\nsuperficial sufficed—than the fundamental impropriety of Chad’s\nsituation, round about which they thus seemed cynically clustered.\nAccordingly, since they took it for granted, they took for granted all\nthat was in connexion with it taken for granted at Woollett—matters as\nto which, verily, he had been reduced with Mrs. Newsome to the last\nintensity of silence. That was the consequence of their being too bad\nto be talked about, and was the accompaniment, by the same token, of a\ndeep conception of their badness. It befell therefore that when poor\nStrether put it to himself that their badness was ultimately, or\nperhaps even insolently, what such a scene as the one before him was,\nso to speak, built upon, he could scarce shirk the dilemma of reading a\nroundabout echo of them into almost anything that came up. This, he was\nwell aware, was a dreadful necessity; but such was the stern logic, he\ncould only gather, of a relation to the irregular life.\n\nIt was the way the irregular life sat upon Bilham and Miss Barrace that\nwas the insidious, the delicate marvel. He was eager to concede that\ntheir relation to it was all indirect, for anything else in him would\nhave shown the grossness of bad manners; but the indirectness was none\nthe less consonant—_that_ was striking—with a grateful enjoyment of\neverything that was Chad’s. They spoke of him repeatedly, invoking his\ngood name and good nature, and the worst confusion of mind for Strether\nwas that all their mention of him was of a kind to do him honour. They\ncommended his munificence and approved his taste, and in doing so sat\ndown, as it seemed to Strether, in the very soil out of which these\nthings flowered. Our friend’s final predicament was that he himself was\nsitting down, for the time, _with_ them, and there was a supreme moment\nat which, compared with his collapse, Waymarsh’s erectness affected him\nas really high. One thing was certain—he saw he must make up his mind.\nHe must approach Chad, must wait for him, deal with him, master him,\nbut he mustn’t dispossess himself of the faculty of seeing things as\nthey were. He must bring him to _him_—not go himself, as it were, so\nmuch of the way. He must at any rate be clearer as to what—should he\ncontinue to do that for convenience—he was still condoning. It was on\nthe detail of this quantity—and what could the fact be but\nmystifying?—that Bilham and Miss Barrace threw so little light. So\nthere they were.\n\n\n II\n\nWhen Miss Gostrey arrived, at the end of a week, she made him a sign;\nhe went immediately to see her, and it wasn’t till then that he could\nagain close his grasp on the idea of a corrective. This idea however\nwas luckily all before him again from the moment he crossed the\nthreshold of the little entresol of the Quartier Marbœuf into which she\nhad gathered, as she said, picking them up in a thousand flights and\nfunny little passionate pounces, the makings of a final nest. He\nrecognised in an instant that there really, there only, he should find\nthe boon with the vision of which he had first mounted Chad’s stairs.\nHe might have been a little scared at the picture of how much more, in\nthis place, he should know himself “in” hadn’t his friend been on the\nspot to measure the amount to his appetite. Her compact and crowded\nlittle chambers, almost dusky, as they at first struck him, with\naccumulations, represented a supreme general adjustment to\nopportunities and conditions. Wherever he looked he saw an old ivory or\nan old brocade, and he scarce knew where to sit for fear of a\nmisappliance. The life of the occupant struck him of a sudden as more\ncharged with possession even than Chad’s or than Miss Barrace’s; wide\nas his glimpse had lately become of the empire of “things,” what was\nbefore him still enlarged it; the lust of the eyes and the pride of\nlife had indeed thus their temple. It was the innermost nook of the\nshrine—as brown as a pirate’s cave. In the brownness were glints of\ngold; patches of purple were in the gloom; objects all that caught,\nthrough the muslin, with their high rarity, the light of the low\nwindows. Nothing was clear about them but that they were precious, and\nthey brushed his ignorance with their contempt as a flower, in a\nliberty taken with him, might have been whisked under his nose. But\nafter a full look at his hostess he knew none the less what most\nconcerned him. The circle in which they stood together was warm with\nlife, and every question between them would live there as nowhere else.\nA question came up as soon as they had spoken, for his answer, with a\nlaugh, was quickly: “Well, they’ve got hold of me!” Much of their talk\non this first occasion was his development of that truth. He was\nextraordinarily glad to see her, expressing to her frankly what she\nmost showed him, that one might live for years without a blessing\nunsuspected, but that to know it at last for no more than three days\nwas to need it or miss it for ever. She was the blessing that had now\nbecome his need, and what could prove it better than that without her\nhe had lost himself?\n\n“What do you mean?” she asked with an absence of alarm that, correcting\nhim as if he had mistaken the “period” of one of her pieces, gave him\nafresh a sense of her easy movement through the maze he had but begun\nto tread. “What in the name of all the Pococks have you managed to do?”\n\n“Why exactly the wrong thing. I’ve made a frantic friend of little\nBilham.”\n\n“Ah that sort of thing was of the essence of your case and to have been\nallowed for from the first.” And it was only after this that, quite as\na minor matter, she asked who in the world little Bilham might be. When\nshe learned that he was a friend of Chad’s and living for the time in\nChad’s rooms in Chad’s absence, quite as if acting in Chad’s spirit and\nserving Chad’s cause, she showed, however, more interest. “Should you\nmind my seeing him? Only once, you know,” she added.\n\n“Oh the oftener the better: he’s amusing—he’s original.”\n\n“He doesn’t shock you?” Miss Gostrey threw out.\n\n“Never in the world! We escape that with a perfection—! I feel it to be\nlargely, no doubt, because I don’t half-understand him; but our _modus\nvivendi_ isn’t spoiled even by that. You must dine with me to meet\nhim,” Strether went on. “Then you’ll see.’\n\n“Are you giving dinners?”\n\n“Yes—there I am. That’s what I mean.”\n\nAll her kindness wondered. “That you’re spending too much money?”\n\n“Dear no—they seem to cost so little. But that I do it to _them_. I\nought to hold off.”\n\nShe thought again—she laughed. “The money you must be spending to think\nit cheap! But I must be out of it—to the naked eye.”\n\nHe looked for a moment as if she were really failing him. “Then you\nwon’t meet them?” It was almost as if she had developed an unexpected\npersonal prudence.\n\nShe hesitated. “Who are they—first?”\n\n“Why little Bilham to begin with.” He kept back for the moment Miss\nBarrace. “And Chad—when he comes—you must absolutely see.”\n\n“When then does he come?”\n\n“When Bilham has had time to write him, and hear from him about me.\nBilham, however,” he pursued, “will report favourably—favourably for\nChad. That will make him not afraid to come. I want you the more\ntherefore, you see, for my bluff.”\n\n“Oh you’ll do yourself for your bluff.” She was perfectly easy. “At the\nrate you’ve gone I’m quiet.”\n\n“Ah but I haven’t,” said Strether, “made one protest.”\n\nShe turned it over. “Haven’t you been seeing what there’s to protest\nabout?”\n\nHe let her, with this, however ruefully, have the whole truth. “I\nhaven’t yet found a single thing.”\n\n“Isn’t there any one _with_ him then?”\n\n“Of the sort I came out about?” Strether took a moment. “How do I know?\nAnd what do I care?”\n\n“Oh oh!”—and her laughter spread. He was struck in fact by the effect\non her of his joke. He saw now how he meant it as a joke. _She_ saw,\nhowever, still other things, though in an instant she had hidden them.\n“You’ve got at no facts at all?”\n\nHe tried to muster them. “Well, he has a lovely home.”\n\n“Ah that, in Paris,” she quickly returned, “proves nothing. That is\nrather it _dis_proves nothing. They may very well, you see, the people\nyour mission is concerned with, have done it _for_ him.”\n\n“Exactly. And it was on the scene of their doings then that Waymarsh\nand I sat guzzling.”\n\n“Oh if you forbore to guzzle here on scenes of doings,” she replied,\n“you might easily die of starvation.” With which she smiled at him.\n“You’ve worse before you.”\n\n“Ah I’ve _everything_ before me. But on our hypothesis, you know, they\nmust be wonderful.”\n\n“They _are!_” said Miss Gostrey. “You’re not therefore, you see,” she\nadded, “wholly without facts. They’ve _been_, in effect, wonderful.”\n\nTo have got at something comparatively definite appeared at last a\nlittle to help—a wave by which moreover, the next moment, recollection\nwas washed. “My young man does admit furthermore that they’re our\nfriend’s great interest.”\n\n“Is that the expression he uses?”\n\nStrether more exactly recalled. “No—not quite.”\n\n“Something more vivid? Less?”\n\nHe had bent, with neared glasses, over a group of articles on a small\nstand; and at this he came up. “It was a mere allusion, but, on the\nlookout as I was, it struck me. ‘Awful, you know, as Chad is’—those\nwere Bilham’s words.”\n\n“‘Awful, you know’—? Oh!”—and Miss Gostrey turned them over. She\nseemed, however, satisfied. “Well, what more do you want?”\n\nHe glanced once more at a bibelot or two, and everything sent him back.\n“But it _is_ all the same as if they wished to let me have it between\nthe eyes.”\n\nShe wondered. “Quoi donc?”\n\n“Why what I speak of. The amenity. They can stun you with that as well\nas with anything else.”\n\n“Oh,” she answered, “you’ll come round! I must see them each,” she went\non, “for myself. I mean Mr. Bilham and Mr. Newsome—Mr. Bilham naturally\nfirst. Once only—once for each; that will do. But face to face—for half\nan hour. What’s Mr. Chad,” she immediately pursued, “doing at Cannes?\nDecent men don’t go to Cannes with the—well, with the kind of ladies\nyou mean.”\n\n“Don’t they?” Strether asked with an interest in decent men that amused\nher.\n\n“No, elsewhere, but not to Cannes. Cannes is different. Cannes is\nbetter. Cannes is best. I mean it’s all people you know—when you do\nknow them. And if _he_ does, why that’s different too. He must have\ngone alone. She can’t be with him.”\n\n“I haven’t,” Strether confessed in his weakness, “the least idea.”\nThere seemed much in what she said, but he was able after a little to\nhelp her to a nearer impression. The meeting with little Bilham took\nplace, by easy arrangement, in the great gallery of the Louvre; and\nwhen, standing with his fellow visitor before one of the splendid\nTitians—the overwhelming portrait of the young man with the\nstrangely-shaped glove and the blue-grey eyes—he turned to see the\nthird member of their party advance from the end of the waxed and\ngilded vista, he had a sense of having at last taken hold. He had\nagreed with Miss Gostrey—it dated even from Chester—for a morning at\nthe Louvre, and he had embraced independently the same idea as thrown\nout by little Bilham, whom he had already accompanied to the museum of\nthe Luxembourg. The fusion of these schemes presented no difficulty,\nand it was to strike him again that in little Bilham’s company\ncontrarieties in general dropped.\n\n“Oh he’s all right—he’s one of _us!_” Miss Gostrey, after the first\nexchange, soon found a chance to murmur to her companion; and Strether,\nas they proceeded and paused and while a quick unanimity between the\ntwo appeared to have phrased itself in half a dozen remarks—Strether\nknew that he knew almost immediately what she meant, and took it as\nstill another sign that he had got his job in hand. This was the more\ngrateful to him that he could think of the intelligence now serving him\nas an acquisition positively new. He wouldn’t have known even the day\nbefore what she meant—that is if she meant, what he assumed, that they\nwere intense Americans together. He had just worked round—and with a\nsharper turn of the screw than any yet—to the conception of an American\nintense as little Bilham was intense. The young man was his first\nspecimen; the specimen had profoundly perplexed him; at present however\nthere was light. It was by little Bilham’s amazing serenity that he had\nat first been affected, but he had inevitably, in his circumspection,\nfelt it as the trail of the serpent, the corruption, as he might\nconveniently have said, of Europe; whereas the promptness with which it\ncame up for Miss Gostrey but as a special little form of the oldest\nthing they knew justified it at once to his own vision as well. He\nwanted to be able to like his specimen with a clear good conscience,\nand this fully permitted it. What had muddled him was precisely the\nsmall artist-man’s way—it was so complete—of being more American than\nanybody. But it now for the time put Strether vastly at his ease to\nhave this view of a new way.\n\nThe amiable youth then looked out, as it had first struck Strether, at\na world in respect to which he hadn’t a prejudice. The one our friend\nmost instantly missed was the usual one in favour of an occupation\naccepted. Little Bilham had an occupation, but it was only an\noccupation declined; and it was by his general exemption from alarm,\nanxiety or remorse on this score that the impression of his serenity\nwas made. He had come out to Paris to paint—to fathom, that is, at\nlarge, that mystery; but study had been fatal to him so far as anything\n_could_ be fatal, and his productive power faltered in proportion as\nhis knowledge grew. Strether had gathered from him that at the moment\nof his finding him in Chad’s rooms he hadn’t saved from his shipwreck a\nscrap of anything but his beautiful intelligence and his confirmed\nhabit of Paris. He referred to these things with an equal fond\nfamiliarity, and it was sufficiently clear that, as an outfit, they\nstill served him. They were charming to Strether through the hour spent\nat the Louvre, where indeed they figured for him as an unseparated part\nof the charged iridescent air, the glamour of the name, the splendour\nof the space, the colour of the masters. Yet they were present too\nwherever the young man led, and the day after the visit to the Louvre\nthey hung, in a different walk, about the steps of our party. He had\ninvited his companions to cross the river with him, offering to show\nthem his own poor place; and his own poor place, which was very poor,\ngave to his idiosyncrasies, for Strether—the small sublime indifference\nand independences that had struck the latter as fresh—an odd and\nengaging dignity. He lived at the end of an alley that went out of an\nold short cobbled street, a street that went in turn out of a new long\nsmooth avenue—street and avenue and alley having, however, in common a\nsort of social shabbiness; and he introduced them to the rather cold\nand blank little studio which he had lent to a comrade for the term of\nhis elegant absence. The comrade was another ingenuous compatriot, to\nwhom he had wired that tea was to await them “regardless,” and this\nreckless repast, and the second ingenuous compatriot, and the faraway\nmakeshift life, with its jokes and its gaps, its delicate daubs and its\nthree or four chairs, its overflow of taste and conviction and its lack\nof nearly all else—these things wove round the occasion a spell to\nwhich our hero unreservedly surrendered.\n\nHe liked the ingenuous compatriots—for two or three others soon\ngathered; he liked the delicate daubs and the free\ndiscriminations—involving references indeed, involving enthusiasms and\nexecrations that made him, as they said, sit up; he liked above all the\nlegend of good-humoured poverty, of mutual accommodation fairly raised\nto the romantic, that he soon read into the scene. The ingenuous\ncompatriots showed a candour, he thought, surpassing even the candour\nof Woollett; they were red-haired and long-legged, they were quaint and\nqueer and dear and droll; they made the place resound with the\nvernacular, which he had never known so marked as when figuring for the\nchosen language, he must suppose, of contemporary art. They twanged\nwith a vengeance the æsthetic lyre—they drew from it wonderful airs.\nThis aspect of their life had an admirable innocence; and he looked on\noccasion at Maria Gostrey to see to what extent that element reached\nher. She gave him however for the hour, as she had given him the\nprevious day, no further sign than to show how she dealt with boys;\nmeeting them with the air of old Parisian practice that she had for\nevery one, for everything, in turn. Wonderful about the delicate daubs,\nmasterful about the way to make tea, trustful about the legs of chairs\nand familiarly reminiscent of those, in the other time, the named, the\nnumbered or the caricatured, who had flourished or failed, disappeared\nor arrived, she had accepted with the best grace her second course of\nlittle Bilham, and had said to Strether, the previous afternoon on his\nleaving them, that, since her impression was to be renewed, she would\nreserve judgement till after the new evidence.\n\nThe new evidence was to come, as it proved, in a day or two. He soon\nhad from Maria a message to the effect that an excellent box at the\nFrançais had been lent her for the following night; it seeming on such\noccasions not the least of her merits that she was subject to such\napproaches. The sense of how she was always paying for something in\nadvance was equalled on Strether’s part only by the sense of how she\nwas always being paid; all of which made for his consciousness, in the\nlarger air, of a lively bustling traffic, the exchange of such values\nas were not for him to handle. She hated, he knew, at the French play,\nanything but a box—just as she hated at the English anything but a\nstall; and a box was what he was already in this phase girding himself\nto press upon her. But she had for that matter her community with\nlittle Bilham: she too always, on the great issues, showed as having\nknown in time. It made her constantly beforehand with him and gave him\nmainly the chance to ask himself how on the day of their settlement\ntheir account would stand. He endeavoured even now to keep it a little\nstraight by arranging that if he accepted her invitation she should\ndine with him first; but the upshot of this scruple was that at eight\no’clock on the morrow he awaited her with Waymarsh under the pillared\nportico. She hadn’t dined with him, and it was characteristic of their\nrelation that she had made him embrace her refusal without in the least\nunderstanding it. She ever caused her rearrangements to affect him as\nher tenderest touches. It was on that principle for instance that,\ngiving him the opportunity to be amiable again to little Bilham, she\nhad suggested his offering the young man a seat in their box. Strether\nhad dispatched for this purpose a small blue missive to the Boulevard\nMalesherbes, but up to the moment of their passing into the theatre he\nhad received no response to his message. He held, however, even after\nthey had been for some time conveniently seated, that their friend, who\nknew his way about, would come in at his own right moment. His\ntemporary absence moreover seemed, as never yet, to make the right\nmoment for Miss Gostrey. Strether had been waiting till tonight to get\nback from her in some mirrored form her impressions and conclusions.\nShe had elected, as they said, to see little Bilham once; but now she\nhad seen him twice and had nevertheless not said more than a word.\n\nWaymarsh meanwhile sat opposite him with their hostess between; and\nMiss Gostrey spoke of herself as an instructor of youth introducing her\nlittle charges to a work that was one of the glories of literature. The\nglory was happily unobjectionable, and the little charges were candid;\nfor herself she had travelled that road and she merely waited on their\ninnocence. But she referred in due time to their absent friend, whom it\nwas clear they should have to give up. “He either won’t have got your\nnote,” she said, “or you won’t have got his: he has had some kind of\nhindrance, and, of course, for that matter, you know, a man never\nwrites about coming to a box.” She spoke as if, with her look, it might\nhave been Waymarsh who had written to the youth, and the latter’s face\nshowed a mixture of austerity and anguish. She went on however as if to\nmeet this. “He’s far and away, you know, the best of them.”\n\n“The best of whom, ma’am?”\n\n“Why of all the long procession—the boys, the girls, or the old men and\nold women as they sometimes really are; the hope, as one may say, of\nour country. They’ve all passed, year after year; but there has been no\none in particular I’ve ever wanted to stop. I feel—don’t _you?_—that I\nwant to stop little Bilham; he’s so exactly right as he is.” She\ncontinued to talk to Waymarsh. “He’s too delightful. If he’ll only not\nspoil it! But they always _will_; they always do; they always have.”\n\n“I don’t think Waymarsh knows,” Strether said after a moment, “quite\nwhat it’s open to Bilham to spoil.”\n\n“It can’t be a good American,” Waymarsh lucidly enough replied; “for it\ndidn’t strike me the young man had developed much in _that_ shape.”\n\n“Ah,” Miss Gostrey sighed, “the name of the good American is as easily\ngiven as taken away! What _is_ it, to begin with, to _be_ one, and\nwhat’s the extraordinary hurry? Surely nothing that’s so pressing was\never so little defined. It’s such an order, really, that before we cook\nyou the dish we must at least have your receipt. Besides the poor\nchicks have time! What I’ve seen so often spoiled,” she pursued, “is\nthe happy attitude itself, the state of faith and—what shall I call\nit?—the sense of beauty. You’re right about him”—she now took in\nStrether; “little Bilham has them to a charm, we must keep little\nBilham along.” Then she was all again for Waymarsh. “The others have\nall wanted so dreadfully to do something, and they’ve gone and done it\nin too many cases indeed. It leaves them never the same afterwards; the\ncharm’s always somehow broken. Now _he_, I think, you know, really\nwon’t. He won’t do the least dreadful little thing. We shall continue\nto enjoy him just as he is. No—he’s quite beautiful. He sees\neverything. He isn’t a bit ashamed. He has every scrap of the courage\nof it that one could ask. Only think what he _might_ do. One wants\nreally—for fear of some accident—to keep him in view. At this very\nmoment perhaps what mayn’t he be up to? I’ve had my disappointments—the\npoor things are never really safe; or only at least when you have them\nunder your eye. One can never completely trust them. One’s uneasy, and\nI think that’s why I most miss him now.”\n\nShe had wound up with a laugh of enjoyment over her embroidery of her\nidea—an enjoyment that her face communicated to Strether, who almost\nwished none the less at this moment that she would let poor Waymarsh\nalone. _He_ knew more or less what she meant; but the fact wasn’t a\nreason for her not pretending to Waymarsh that he didn’t. It was craven\nof him perhaps, but he would, for the high amenity of the occasion,\nhave liked Waymarsh not to be so sure of his wit. Her recognition of it\ngave him away and, before she had done with him or with that article,\nwould give him worse. What was he, all the same, to do? He looked\nacross the box at his friend; their eyes met; something queer and\nstiff, something that bore on the situation but that it was better not\nto touch, passed in silence between them. Well, the effect of it for\nStrether was an abrupt reaction, a final impatience of his own tendency\nto temporise. Where was that taking him anyway? It was one of the quiet\ninstants that sometimes settle more matters than the outbreaks dear to\nthe historic muse. The only qualification of the quietness was the\nsynthetic “Oh hang it!” into which Strether’s share of the silence\nsoundlessly flowered. It represented, this mute ejaculation, a final\nimpulse to burn his ships. These ships, to the historic muse, may seem\nof course mere cockles, but when he presently spoke to Miss Gostrey it\nwas with the sense at least of applying the torch. “Is it then a\nconspiracy?”\n\n“Between the two young men? Well, I don’t pretend to be a seer or a\nprophetess,” she presently replied; “but if I’m simply a woman of sense\nhe’s working for you to-night. I don’t quite know how—but it’s in my\nbones.” And she looked at him at last as if, little material as she yet\ngave him, he’d really understand. “For an opinion _that’s_ my opinion.\nHe makes you out too well not to.”\n\n“Not to work for me to-night?” Strether wondered. “Then I hope he isn’t\ndoing anything very bad.”\n\n“They’ve got you,” she portentously answered.\n\n“Do you mean he _is_—?”\n\n“They’ve got you,” she merely repeated. Though she disclaimed the\nprophetic vision she was at this instant the nearest approach he had\never met to the priestess of the oracle. The light was in her eyes.\n“You must face it now.”\n\nHe faced it on the spot. “They _had_ arranged—?”\n\n“Every move in the game. And they’ve been arranging ever since. He has\nhad every day his little telegram from Cannes.”\n\nIt made Strether open his eyes. “Do you _know_ that?”\n\n“I do better. I see it. This was, before I met him, what I wondered\nwhether I _was_ to see. But as soon as I met him I ceased to wonder,\nand our second meeting made me sure. I took him all in. He was\nacting—he is still—on his daily instructions.”\n\n“So that Chad has done the whole thing?”\n\n“Oh no—not the whole. _We’ve_ done some of it. You and I and ‘Europe.’”\n\n“Europe—yes,” Strether mused.\n\n“Dear old Paris,” she seemed to explain. But there was more, and, with\none of her turns, she risked it. “And dear old Waymarsh. You,” she\ndeclared, “have been a good bit of it.”\n\nHe sat massive. “A good bit of what, ma’am?”\n\n“Why of the wonderful consciousness of our friend here. You’ve helped\ntoo in your way to float him to where he is.”\n\n“And where the devil _is_ he?”\n\nShe passed it on with a laugh. “Where the devil, Strether, are you?”\n\nHe spoke as if he had just been thinking it out. “Well, quite already\nin Chad’s hands, it would seem.” And he had had with this another\nthought. “Will that be—just all through Bilham—the way he’s going to\nwork it? It would be, for him, you know, an idea. And Chad with an\nidea—!”\n\n“Well?” she asked while the image held him.\n\n“Well, is Chad—what shall I say?—monstrous?”\n\n“Oh as much as you like! But the idea you speak of,” she said, “won’t\nhave been his best. He’ll have a better. It won’t be all through little\nBilham that he’ll work it.”\n\nThis already sounded almost like a hope destroyed. “Through whom else\nthen?”\n\n“That’s what we shall see!” But quite as she spoke she turned, and\nStrether turned; for the door of the box had opened, with the click of\nthe _ouvreuse_, from the lobby, and a gentleman, a stranger to them,\nhad come in with a quick step. The door closed behind him, and, though\ntheir faces showed him his mistake, his air, which was striking, was\nall good confidence. The curtain had just again arisen, and, in the\nhush of the general attention, Strether’s challenge was tacit, as was\nalso the greeting, with a quickly deprecating hand and smile, of the\nunannounced visitor. He discreetly signed that he would wait, would\nstand, and these things and his face, one look from which she had\ncaught, had suddenly worked for Miss Gostrey. She fitted to them all an\nanswer for Strether’s last question. The solid stranger was simply the\nanswer—as she now, turning to her friend, indicated. She brought it\nstraight out for him—it presented the intruder. “Why, through this\ngentleman!” The gentleman indeed, at the same time, though sounding for\nStrether a very short name, did practically as much to explain.\nStrether gasped the name back—then only had he seen Miss Gostrey had\nsaid more than she knew. They were in presence of Chad himself.\n\nOur friend was to go over it afterwards again and again—he was going\nover it much of the time that they were together, and they were\ntogether constantly for three or four days: the note had been so\nstrongly struck during that first half-hour that everything happening\nsince was comparatively a minor development. The fact was that his\nperception of the young man’s identity—so absolutely checked for a\nminute—had been quite one of the sensations that count in life; he\ncertainly had never known one that had acted, as he might have said,\nwith more of a crowded rush. And the rush though both vague and\nmultitudinous, had lasted a long time, protected, as it were, yet at\nthe same time aggravated, by the circumstance of its coinciding with a\nstretch of decorous silence. They couldn’t talk without disturbing the\nspectators in the part of the balcony just below them; and it, for that\nmatter, came to Strether—being a thing of the sort that did come to\nhim—that these were the accidents of a high civilisation; the imposed\ntribute to propriety, the frequent exposure to conditions, usually\nbrilliant, in which relief has to await its time. Relief was never\nquite near at hand for kings, queens, comedians and other such people,\nand though you might be yourself not exactly one of those, you could\nyet, in leading the life of high pressure, guess a little how they\nsometimes felt. It was truly the life of high pressure that Strether\nhad seemed to feel himself lead while he sat there, close to Chad,\nduring the long tension of the act. He was in presence of a fact that\noccupied his whole mind, that occupied for the half-hour his senses\nthemselves all together; but he couldn’t without inconvenience show\nanything—which moreover might count really as luck. What he might have\nshown, had he shown at all, was exactly the kind of emotion—the emotion\nof bewilderment—that he had proposed to himself from the first,\nwhatever should occur, to show least. The phenomenon that had suddenly\nsat down there with him was a phenomenon of change so complete that his\nimagination, which had worked so beforehand, felt itself, in the\nconnexion, without margin or allowance. It had faced every contingency\nbut that Chad should not _be_ Chad, and this was what it now had to\nface with a mere strained smile and an uncomfortable flush.\n\nHe asked himself if, by any chance, before he should have in some way\nto commit himself, he might feel his mind settled to the new vision,\nmight habituate it, so to speak, to the remarkable truth. But oh it was\ntoo remarkable, the truth; for what could be more remarkable than this\nsharp rupture of an identity? You could deal with a man as himself—you\ncouldn’t deal with him as somebody else. It was a small source of peace\nmoreover to be reduced to wondering how little he might know in such an\nevent what a sum he was setting you. He couldn’t absolutely not know,\nfor you couldn’t absolutely not let him. It was a _case_ then simply, a\nstrong case, as people nowadays called such things, a case of\ntransformation unsurpassed, and the hope was but in the general law\nthat strong cases were liable to control from without. Perhaps he,\nStrether himself, was the only person after all aware of it. Even Miss\nGostrey, with all her science, wouldn’t be, would she?—and he had never\nseen any one less aware of anything than Waymarsh as he glowered at\nChad. The social sightlessness of his old friend’s survey marked for\nhim afresh, and almost in an humiliating way, the inevitable limits of\ndirect aid from this source. He was not certain, however, of not\ndrawing a shade of compensation from the privilege, as yet untasted, of\nknowing more about something in particular than Miss Gostrey did. His\nsituation too was a case, for that matter, and he was now so\ninterested, quite so privately agog, about it, that he had already an\neye to the fun it would be to open up to her afterwards. He derived\nduring his half-hour no assistance from her, and just this fact of her\nnot meeting his eyes played a little, it must be confessed, into his\npredicament.\n\nHe had introduced Chad, in the first minutes, under his breath, and\nthere was never the primness in her of the person unacquainted; but she\nhad none the less betrayed at first no vision but of the stage, where\nshe occasionally found a pretext for an appreciative moment that she\ninvited Waymarsh to share. The latter’s faculty of participation had\nnever had, all round, such an assault to meet; the pressure on him\nbeing the sharper for this chosen attitude in her, as Strether judged\nit, of isolating, for their natural intercourse, Chad and himself. This\nintercourse was meanwhile restricted to a frank friendly look from the\nyoung man, something markedly like a smile, but falling far short of a\ngrin, and to the vivacity of Strether’s private speculation as to\nwhether _he_ carried himself like a fool. He didn’t quite see how he\ncould so feel as one without somehow showing as one. The worst of that\nquestion moreover was that he knew it as a symptom the sense of which\nannoyed him. “If I’m going to be odiously conscious of how I may strike\nthe fellow,” he reflected, “it was so little what I came out for that I\nmay as well stop before I begin.” This sage consideration too,\ndistinctly, seemed to leave untouched the fact that he _was_ going to\nbe conscious. He was conscious of everything but of what would have\nserved him.\n\nHe was to know afterwards, in the watches of the night, that nothing\nwould have been more open to him than after a minute or two to propose\nto Chad to seek with him the refuge of the lobby. He hadn’t only not\nproposed it, but had lacked even the presence of mind to see it as\npossible. He had stuck there like a schoolboy wishing not to miss a\nminute of the show; though for that portion of the show then presented\nhe hadn’t had an instant’s real attention. He couldn’t when the curtain\nfell have given the slightest account of what had happened. He had\ntherefore, further, not at that moment acknowledged the amenity added\nby this acceptance of his awkwardness to Chad’s general patience.\nHadn’t he none the less known at the very time—known it stupidly and\nwithout reaction—that the boy was accepting something? He was modestly\nbenevolent, the boy—that was at least what he had been capable of the\nsuperiority of making out his chance to be; and one had one’s self\nliterally not had the gumption to get in ahead of him. If we should go\ninto all that occupied our friend in the watches of the night we should\nhave to mend our pen; but an instance or two may mark for us the\nvividness with which he could remember. He remembered the two\nabsurdities that, if his presence of mind _had_ failed, were the things\nthat had had most to do with it. He had never in his life seen a young\nman come into a box at ten o’clock at night, and would, if challenged\non the question in advance, have scarce been ready to pronounce as to\ndifferent ways of doing so. But it was in spite of this definite to him\nthat Chad had had a way that was wonderful: a fact carrying with it an\nimplication that, as one might imagine it, he knew, he had learned,\nhow.\n\nHere already then were abounding results; he had on the spot and\nwithout the least trouble of intention taught Strether that even in so\nsmall a thing as that there were different ways. He had done in the\nsame line still more than this; had by a mere shake or two of the head\nmade his old friend observe that the change in him was perhaps more\nthan anything else, for the eye, a matter of the marked streaks of\ngrey, extraordinary at his age, in his thick black hair; as well as\nthat this new feature was curiously becoming to him, did something for\nhim, as characterisation, also even—of all things in the world—as\nrefinement, that had been a good deal wanted. Strether felt, however,\nhe would have had to confess, that it wouldn’t have been easy just now,\non this and other counts, in the presence of what had been supplied, to\nbe quite clear as to what had been missed. A reflexion a candid critic\nmight have made of old, for instance, was that it would have been\nhappier for the son to look more like the mother; but this was a\nreflexion that at present would never occur. The ground had quite\nfallen away from it, yet no resemblance whatever to the mother had\nsupervened. It would have been hard for a young man’s face and air to\ndisconnect themselves more completely than Chad’s at this juncture from\nany discerned, from any imaginable aspect of a New England female\nparent. That of course was no more than had been on the cards; but it\nproduced in Strether none the less one of those frequent phenomena of\nmental reference with which all judgement in him was actually beset.\n\nAgain and again as the days passed he had had a sense of the pertinence\nof communicating quickly with Woollett—communicating with a quickness\nwith which telegraphy alone would rhyme; the fruit really of a fine\nfancy in him for keeping things straight, for the happy forestalment of\nerror. No one could explain better when needful, nor put more\nconscience into an account or a report; which burden of conscience is\nperhaps exactly the reason why his heart always sank when the clouds of\nexplanation gathered. His highest ingenuity was in keeping the sky of\nlife clear of them. Whether or no he had a grand idea of the lucid, he\nheld that nothing ever was in fact—for any one else—explained. One went\nthrough the vain motions, but it was mostly a waste of life. A personal\nrelation was a relation only so long as people either perfectly\nunderstood or, better still, didn’t care if they didn’t. From the\nmoment they cared if they didn’t it was living by the sweat of one’s\nbrow; and the sweat of one’s brow was just what one might buy one’s\nself off from by keeping the ground free of the wild weed of delusion.\nIt easily grew too fast, and the Atlantic cable now alone could race\nwith it. That agency would each day have testified for him to something\nthat was not what Woollett had argued. He was not at this moment\nabsolutely sure that the effect of the morrow’s—or rather of the\nnight’s—appreciation of the crisis wouldn’t be to determine some brief\nmissive. “Have at last seen him, but oh dear!”—some temporary relief of\nthat sort seemed to hover before him. It hovered somehow as preparing\nthem all—yet preparing them for what? If he might do so more luminously\nand cheaply he would tick out in four words: “Awfully old—grey hair.”\nTo this particular item in Chad’s appearance he constantly, during\ntheir mute half-hour, reverted; as if so very much more than he could\nhave said had been involved in it. The most he could have said would\nhave been: “If he’s going to make me feel young—!” which indeed,\nhowever, carried with it quite enough. If Strether was to feel young,\nthat is, it would be because Chad was to feel old; and an aged and\nhoary sinner had been no part of the scheme.\n\nThe question of Chadwick’s true time of life was, doubtless, what came\nup quickest after the adjournment of the two, when the play was over,\nto a café in the Avenue de l’Opéra. Miss Gostrey had in due course been\nperfect for such a step; she had known exactly what they wanted—to go\nstraight somewhere and talk; and Strether had even felt she had known\nwhat he wished to say and that he was arranging immediately to begin.\nShe hadn’t pretended this, as she _had_ pretended on the other hand, to\nhave divined Waymarsh’s wish to extend to her an independent protection\nhomeward; but Strether nevertheless found how, after he had Chad\nopposite to him at a small table in the brilliant halls that his\ncompanion straightway selected, sharply and easily discriminated from\nothers, it was quite, to his mind, as if she heard him speak; as if,\nsitting up, a mile away, in the little apartment he knew, she would\nlisten hard enough to catch. He found too that he liked that idea, and\nhe wished that, by the same token, Mrs. Newsome might have caught as\nwell. For what had above all been determined in him as a necessity of\nthe first order was not to lose another hour, nor a fraction of one;\nwas to advance, to overwhelm, with a rush. This was how he would\nanticipate—by a night-attack, as might be—any forced maturity that a\ncrammed consciousness of Paris was likely to take upon itself to assert\non behalf of the boy. He knew to the full, on what he had just\nextracted from Miss Gostrey, Chad’s marks of alertness; but they were a\nreason the more for not dawdling. If he was himself moreover to be\ntreated as young he wouldn’t at all events be so treated before he\nshould have struck out at least once. His arms might be pinioned\nafterwards, but it would have been left on record that he was fifty.\nThe importance of this he had indeed begun to feel before they left the\ntheatre; it had become a wild unrest, urging him to seize his chance.\nHe could scarcely wait for it as they went; he was on the verge of the\nindecency of bringing up the question in the street; he fairly caught\nhimself going on—so he afterwards invidiously named it—as if there\nwould be for him no second chance should the present be lost. Not till,\non the purple divan before the perfunctory _bock_, he had brought out\nthe words themselves, was he sure, for that matter, that the present\nwould be saved.\n\n\nBook Fourth\n\n\n I\n\n“I’ve come, you know, to make you break with everything, neither more\nnor less, and take you straight home; so you’ll be so good as\nimmediately and favourably to consider it!”—Strether, face to face with\nChad after the play, had sounded these words almost breathlessly, and\nwith an effect at first positively disconcerting to himself alone. For\nChad’s receptive attitude was that of a person who had been gracefully\nquiet while the messenger at last reaching him has run a mile through\nthe dust. During some seconds after he had spoken Strether felt as if\n_he_ had made some such exertion; he was not even certain that the\nperspiration wasn’t on his brow. It was the kind of consciousness for\nwhich he had to thank the look that, while the strain lasted, the young\nman’s eyes gave him. They reflected—and the deuce of the thing was that\nthey reflected really with a sort of shyness of kindness—his\nmomentarily disordered state; which fact brought on in its turn for our\nfriend the dawn of a fear that Chad might simply “take it out”—take\neverything out—in being sorry for him. Such a fear, any fear, was\nunpleasant. But everything was unpleasant; it was odd how everything\nhad suddenly turned so. This however was no reason for letting the\nleast thing go. Strether had the next minute proceeded as roundly as if\nwith an advantage to follow up. “Of course I’m a busybody, if you want\nto fight the case to the death; but after all mainly in the sense of\nhaving known you and having given you such attention as you kindly\npermitted when you were in jackets and knickerbockers. Yes—it was\nknickerbockers, I’m busybody enough to remember that; and that you had,\nfor your age—I speak of the first far-away time—tremendously stout\nlegs. Well, we want you to break. Your mother’s heart’s passionately\nset upon it, but she has above and beyond that excellent arguments and\nreasons. I’ve not put them into her head—I needn’t remind you how\nlittle she’s a person who needs that. But they exist—you must take it\nfrom me as a friend both of hers and yours—for myself as well. I didn’t\ninvent them, I didn’t originally work them out; but I understand them,\nI think I can explain them—by which I mean make you actively do them\njustice; and that’s why you see me here. You had better know the worst\nat once. It’s a question of an immediate rupture and an immediate\nreturn. I’ve been conceited enough to dream I can sugar that pill. I\ntake at any rate the greatest interest in the question. I took it\nalready before I left home, and I don’t mind telling you that, altered\nas you are, I take it still more now that I’ve seen you. You’re older\nand—I don’t know what to call it!—more of a handful; but you’re by so\nmuch the more, I seem to make out, to our purpose.”\n\n“Do I strike you as improved?” Strether was to recall that Chad had at\nthis point enquired.\n\nHe was likewise to recall—and it had to count for some time as his\ngreatest comfort—that it had been “given” him, as they said at\nWoollett, to reply with some presence of mind: “I haven’t the least\nidea.” He was really for a while to like thinking he had been\npositively hard. On the point of conceding that Chad had improved in\nappearance, but that to the question of appearance the remark must be\nconfined, he checked even that compromise and left his reservation\nbare. Not only his moral, but also, as it were, his æsthetic sense had\na little to pay for this, Chad being unmistakeably—and wasn’t it a\nmatter of the confounded grey hair again?—handsomer than he had ever\npromised. That however fell in perfectly with what Strether had said.\nThey had no desire to keep down his proper expansion, and he wouldn’t\nbe less to their purpose for not looking, as he had too often done of\nold, only bold and wild. There was indeed a signal particular in which\nhe would distinctly be more so. Strether didn’t, as he talked,\nabsolutely follow himself; he only knew he was clutching his thread and\nthat he held it from moment to moment a little tighter; his mere\nuninterruptedness during the few minutes helped him to do that. He had\nfrequently for a month, turned over what he should say on this very\noccasion, and he seemed at last to have said nothing he had thought\nof—everything was so totally different.\n\nBut in spite of all he had put the flag at the window. This was what he\nhad done, and there was a minute during which he affected himself as\nhaving shaken it hard, flapped it with a mighty flutter, straight in\nfront of his companion’s nose. It gave him really almost the sense of\nhaving already acted his part. The momentary relief—as if from the\nknowledge that nothing of _that_ at least could be undone—sprang from a\nparticular cause, the cause that had flashed into operation, in Miss\nGostrey’s box, with direct apprehension, with amazed recognition, and\nthat had been concerned since then in every throb of his consciousness.\nWhat it came to was that with an absolutely _new_ quantity to deal with\none simply couldn’t know. The new quantity was represented by the fact\nthat Chad had been made over. That was all; whatever it was it was\neverything. Strether had never seen the thing so done before—it was\nperhaps a speciality of Paris. If one had been present at the process\none might little by little have mastered the result; but he was face to\nface, as matters stood, with the finished business. It had freely been\nnoted for him that he might be received as a dog among skittles, but\nthat was on the basis of the old quantity. He had originally thought of\nlines and tones as things to be taken, but these possibilities had now\nquite melted away. There was no computing at all what the young man\nbefore him would think or feel or say on any subject whatever. This\nintelligence Strether had afterwards, to account for his nervousness,\nreconstituted as he might, just as he had also reconstituted the\npromptness with which Chad had corrected his uncertainty. An\nextraordinarily short time had been required for the correction, and\nthere had ceased to be anything negative in his companion’s face and\nair as soon as it was made. “Your engagement to my mother has become\nthen what they call here a _fait accompli?_”—it had consisted, the\ndeterminant touch, in nothing more than that.\n\nWell, that was enough, Strether had felt while his answer hung fire. He\nhad felt at the same time, however, that nothing could less become him\nthan that it should hang fire too long. “Yes,” he said brightly, “it\nwas on the happy settlement of the question that I started. You see\ntherefore to what tune I’m in your family. Moreover,” he added, “I’ve\nbeen supposing you’d suppose it.”\n\n“Oh I’ve been supposing it for a long time, and what you tell me helps\nme to understand that you should want to do something. To do something,\nI mean,” said Chad, “to commemorate an event so—what do they call\nit?—so auspicious. I see you make out, and not unnaturally,” he\ncontinued, “that bringing me home in triumph as a sort of\nwedding-present to Mother would commemorate it better than anything\nelse. You want to make a bonfire in fact,” he laughed, “and you pitch\nme on. Thank you, thank you!” he laughed again.\n\nHe was altogether easy about it, and this made Strether now see how at\nbottom, and in spite of the shade of shyness that really cost him\nnothing, he had from the first moment been easy about everything. The\nshade of shyness was mere good taste. People with manners formed could\napparently have, as one of their best cards, the shade of shyness too.\nHe had leaned a little forward to speak; his elbows were on the table;\nand the inscrutable new face that he had got somewhere and somehow was\nbrought by the movement nearer to his critic’s. There was a fascination\nfor that critic in its not being, this ripe physiognomy, the face that,\nunder observation at least, he had originally carried away from\nWoollett. Strether found a certain freedom on his own side in defining\nit as that of a man of the world—a formula that indeed seemed to come\nnow in some degree to his relief; that of a man to whom things had\nhappened and were variously known. In gleams, in glances, the past did\nperhaps peep out of it; but such lights were faint and instantly\nmerged. Chad was brown and thick and strong, and of old Chad had been\nrough. Was all the difference therefore that he was actually smooth?\nPossibly; for that he _was_ smooth was as marked as in the taste of a\nsauce or in the rub of a hand. The effect of it was general—it had\nretouched his features, drawn them with a cleaner line. It had cleared\nhis eyes and settled his colour and polished his fine square teeth—the\nmain ornament of his face; and at the same time that it had given him a\nform and a surface, almost a design, it had toned his voice,\nestablished his accent, encouraged his smile to more play and his other\nmotions to less. He had formerly, with a great deal of action,\nexpressed very little; and he now expressed whatever was necessary with\nalmost none at all. It was as if in short he had really, copious\nperhaps but shapeless, been put into a firm mould and turned\nsuccessfully out. The phenomenon—Strether kept eyeing it as a\nphenomenon, an eminent case—was marked enough to be touched by the\nfinger. He finally put his hand across the table and laid it on Chad’s\narm. “If you’ll promise me—here on the spot and giving me your word of\nhonour—to break straight off, you’ll make the future the real right\nthing for all of us alike. You’ll ease off the strain of this decent\nbut none the less acute suspense in which I’ve for so many days been\nwaiting for you, and let me turn in to rest. I shall leave you with my\nblessing and go to bed in peace.”\n\nChad again fell back at this and, his hands pocketed, settled himself a\nlittle; in which posture he looked, though he rather anxiously smiled,\nonly the more earnest. Then Strether seemed to see that he was really\nnervous, and he took that as what he would have called a wholesome\nsign. The only mark of it hitherto had been his more than once taking\noff and putting on his wide-brimmed crush hat. He had at this moment\nmade the motion again to remove it, then had only pushed it back, so\nthat it hung informally on his strong young grizzled crop. It was a\ntouch that gave the note of the familiar—the intimate and the\nbelated—to their quiet colloquy; and it was indeed by some such trivial\naid that Strether became aware at the same moment of something else.\nThe observation was at any rate determined in him by some light too\nfine to distinguish from so many others, but it was none the less\nsharply determined. Chad looked unmistakeably during these\ninstants—well, as Strether put it to himself, all he was worth. Our\nfriend had a sudden apprehension of what that would on certain sides\nbe. He saw him in a flash as the young man marked out by women; and for\na concentrated minute the dignity, the comparative austerity, as he\nfunnily fancied it, of this character affected him almost with awe.\nThere was an experience on his interlocutor’s part that looked out at\nhim from under the displaced hat, and that looked out moreover by a\nforce of its own, the deep fact of its quantity and quality, and not\nthrough Chad’s intending bravado or swagger. That was then the way men\nmarked out by women _were_—and also the men by whom the women were\ndoubtless in turn sufficiently distinguished. It affected Strether for\nthirty seconds as a relevant truth, a truth which, however, the next\nminute, had fallen into its relation. “Can’t you imagine there being\nsome questions,” Chad asked, “that a fellow—however much impressed by\nyour charming way of stating things—would like to put to you first?”\n\n“Oh yes—easily. I’m here to answer everything. I think I can even tell\nyou things, of the greatest interest to you, that you won’t know enough\nto ask me. We’ll take as many days to it as you like. But I want,”\nStrether wound up, “to go to bed now.”\n\n“Really?”\n\nChad had spoken in such surprise that he was amused. “Can’t you believe\nit?—with what you put me through?”\n\nThe young man seemed to consider. “Oh I haven’t put you through\nmuch—yet.”\n\n“Do you mean there’s so much more to come?” Strether laughed. “All the\nmore reason then that I should gird myself.” And as if to mark what he\nfelt he could by this time count on he was already on his feet.\n\nChad, still seated, stayed him, with a hand against him, as he passed\nbetween their table and the next. “Oh we shall get on!”\n\nThe tone was, as who should say, everything Strether could have\ndesired; and quite as good the expression of face with which the\nspeaker had looked up at him and kindly held him. All these things\nlacked was their not showing quite so much as the fruit of experience.\nYes, experience was what Chad did play on him, if he didn’t play any\ngrossness of defiance. Of course experience was in a manner defiance;\nbut it wasn’t, at any rate—rather indeed quite the contrary!—grossness;\nwhich was so much gained. He fairly grew older, Strether thought, while\nhe himself so reasoned. Then with his mature pat of his visitor’s arm\nhe also got up; and there had been enough of it all by this time to\nmake the visitor feel that something _was_ settled. Wasn’t it settled\nthat he had at least the testimony of Chad’s own belief in a\nsettlement? Strether found himself treating Chad’s profession that they\nwould get on as a sufficient basis for going to bed. He hadn’t\nnevertheless after this gone to bed directly; for when they had again\npassed out together into the mild bright night a check had virtually\nsprung from nothing more than a small circumstance which might have\nacted only as confirming quiescence. There were people, expressive\nsound, projected light, still abroad, and after they had taken in for a\nmoment, through everything, the great clear architectural street, they\nturned off in tacit union to the quarter of Strether’s hotel. “Of\ncourse,” Chad here abruptly began, “of course Mother’s making things\nout with you about me has been natural—and of course also you’ve had a\ngood deal to go upon. Still, you must have filled out.”\n\nHe had stopped, leaving his friend to wonder a little what point he\nwished to make; and this it was that enabled Strether meanwhile to make\none. “Oh we’ve never pretended to go into detail. We weren’t in the\nleast bound to _that_. It was ‘filling out’ enough to miss you as we\ndid.”\n\nBut Chad rather oddly insisted, though under the high lamp at their\ncorner, where they paused, he had at first looked as if touched by\nStrether’s allusion to the long sense, at home, of his absence. “What I\nmean is you must have imagined.”\n\n“Imagined what?”\n\n“Well—horrors.”\n\nIt affected Strether: horrors were so little—superficially at least—in\nthis robust and reasoning image. But he was none the less there to be\nveracious. “Yes, I dare say we _have_ imagined horrors. But where’s the\nharm if we haven’t been wrong?”\n\nChad raised his face to the lamp, and it was one of the moments at\nwhich he had, in his extraordinary way, most his air of designedly\nshowing himself. It was as if at these instants he just presented\nhimself, his identity so rounded off, his palpable presence and his\nmassive young manhood, as such a link in the chain as might practically\namount to a kind of demonstration. It was as if—and how but\nanomalously?—he couldn’t after all help thinking sufficiently well of\nthese things to let them go for what they were worth. What could there\nbe in this for Strether but the hint of some self-respect, some sense\nof power, oddly perverted; something latent and beyond access, ominous\nand perhaps enviable? The intimation had the next thing, in a flash,\ntaken on a name—a name on which our friend seized as he asked himself\nif he weren’t perhaps really dealing with an irreducible young Pagan.\nThis description—he quite jumped at it—had a sound that gratified his\nmental ear, so that of a sudden he had already adopted it. Pagan—yes,\nthat was, wasn’t it? what Chad _would_ logically be. It was what he\nmust be. It was what he was. The idea was a clue and, instead of\ndarkening the prospect, projected a certain clearness. Strether made\nout in this quick ray that a Pagan was perhaps, at the pass they had\ncome to, the thing most wanted at Woollett. They’d be able to do with\none—a good one; he’d find an opening—yes; and Strether’s imagination\neven now prefigured and accompanied the first appearance there of the\nrousing personage. He had only the slight discomfort of feeling, as the\nyoung man turned away from the lamp, that his thought had in the\nmomentary silence possibly been guessed. “Well, I’ve no doubt,” said\nChad, “you’ve come near enough. The details, as you say, don’t matter.\nIt _has_ been generally the case that I’ve let myself go. But I’m\ncoming round—I’m not so bad now.” With which they walked on again to\nStrether’s hotel.\n\n“Do you mean,” the latter asked as they approached the door, “that\nthere isn’t any woman with you now?”\n\n“But pray what has that to do with it?”\n\n“Why it’s the whole question.”\n\n“Of my going home?” Chad was clearly surprised. “Oh not much! Do you\nthink that when I want to go any one will have any power—”\n\n“To keep you”—Strether took him straight up—“from carrying out your\nwish? Well, our idea has been that somebody has hitherto—or a good many\npersons perhaps—kept you pretty well from ‘wanting.’ That’s what—if\nyou’re in anybody’s hands—may again happen. You don’t answer my\nquestion”—he kept it up; “but if you aren’t in anybody’s hands so much\nthe better. There’s nothing then but what makes for your going.”\n\nChad turned this over. “I don’t answer your question?” He spoke quite\nwithout resenting it. “Well, such questions have always a rather\nexaggerated side. One doesn’t know quite what you mean by being in\nwomen’s ‘hands.’ It’s all so vague. One is when one isn’t. One isn’t\nwhen one is. And then one can’t quite give people away.” He seemed\nkindly to explain. “I’ve _never_ got stuck—so very hard; and, as\nagainst anything at any time really better, I don’t think I’ve ever\nbeen afraid.” There was something in it that held Strether to wonder,\nand this gave him time to go on. He broke out as with a more helpful\nthought. “Don’t you know how I like Paris itself?”\n\nThe upshot was indeed to make our friend marvel. “Oh if _that’s_ all\nthat’s the matter with you—!” It was _he_ who almost showed resentment.\n\nChad’s smile of a truth more than met it. “But isn’t that enough?”\n\nStrether hesitated, but it came out. “Not enough for your mother!”\nSpoken, however, it sounded a trifle odd—the effect of which was that\nChad broke into a laugh. Strether, at this, succumbed as well, though\nwith extreme brevity. “Permit us to have still our theory. But if you\n_are_ so free and so strong you’re inexcusable. I’ll write in the\nmorning,” he added with decision. “I’ll say I’ve got you.”\n\nThis appeared to open for Chad a new interest. “How often do you\nwrite?”\n\n“Oh perpetually.”\n\n“And at great length?”\n\nStrether had become a little impatient. “I hope it’s not found too\ngreat.”\n\n“Oh I’m sure not. And you hear as often?”\n\nAgain Strether paused. “As often as I deserve.”\n\n“Mother writes,” said Chad, “a lovely letter.”\n\nStrether, before the closed _porte-cochère_, fixed him a moment. “It’s\nmore, my boy, than _you_ do! But our suppositions don’t matter,” he\nadded, “if you’re actually not entangled.”\n\nChad’s pride seemed none the less a little touched. “I never _was_\nthat—let me insist. I always had my own way.” With which he pursued:\n“And I have it at present.”\n\n“Then what are you here for? What has kept you,” Strether asked, “if\nyou _have_ been able to leave?”\n\nIt made Chad, after a stare, throw himself back. “Do you think one’s\nkept only by women?” His surprise and his verbal emphasis rang out so\nclear in the still street that Strether winced till he remembered the\nsafety of their English speech. “Is that,” the young man demanded,\n“what they think at Woollett?” At the good faith in the question\nStrether had changed colour, feeling that, as he would have said, he\nhad put his foot in it. He had appeared stupidly to misrepresent what\nthey thought at Woollett; but before he had time to rectify Chad again\nwas upon him. “I must say then you show a low mind!”\n\nIt so fell in, unhappily for Strether, with that reflexion of his own\nprompted in him by the pleasant air of the Boulevard Malesherbes, that\nits disconcerting force was rather unfairly great. It was a dig that,\nadministered by himself—and administered even to poor Mrs. Newsome—was\nno more than salutary; but administered by Chad—and quite logically—it\ncame nearer drawing blood. They _hadn’t_ a low mind—nor any approach to\none; yet incontestably they had worked, and with a certain smugness, on\na basis that might be turned against them. Chad had at any rate pulled\nhis visitor up; he had even pulled up his admirable mother; he had\nabsolutely, by a turn of the wrist and a jerk of the far-flung noose,\npulled up, in a bunch, Woollett browsing in its pride. There was no\ndoubt Woollett _had_ insisted on his coarseness; and what he at present\nstood there for in the sleeping street was, by his manner of striking\nthe other note, to make of such insistence a preoccupation compromising\nto the insisters. It was exactly as if they had imputed to him a\nvulgarity that he had by a mere gesture caused to fall from him. The\ndevil of the case was that Strether felt it, by the same stroke, as\nfalling straight upon himself. He had been wondering a minute ago if\nthe boy weren’t a Pagan, and he found himself wondering now if he\nweren’t by chance a gentleman. It didn’t in the least, on the spot,\nspring up helpfully for him that a person couldn’t at the same time be\nboth. There was nothing at this moment in the air to challenge the\ncombination; there was everything to give it on the contrary something\nof a flourish. It struck Strether into the bargain as doing something\nto meet the most difficult of the questions; though perhaps indeed only\nby substituting another. Wouldn’t it be precisely by having learned to\nbe a gentleman that he had mastered the consequent trick of looking so\nwell that one could scarce speak to him straight? But what in the world\nwas the clue to such a prime producing cause? There were too many clues\nthen that Strether still lacked, and these clues to clues were among\nthem. What it accordingly amounted to for him was that he had to take\nfull in the face a fresh attribution of ignorance. He had grown used by\nthis time to reminders, especially from his own lips, of what he didn’t\nknow; but he had borne them because in the first place they were\nprivate and because in the second they practically conveyed a tribute.\nHe didn’t know what was bad, and—as others didn’t know how little he\nknew it—he could put up with his state. But if he didn’t know, in so\nimportant a particular, what was good, Chad at least was now aware he\ndidn’t; and that, for some reason, affected our friend as curiously\npublic. It was in fact an exposed condition that the young man left him\nin long enough for him to feel its chill—till he saw fit, in a word,\ngenerously again to cover him. This last was in truth what Chad quite\ngracefully did. But he did it as with a simple thought that met the\nwhole of the case. “Oh I’m all right!” It was what Strether had rather\nbewilderedly to go to bed on.\n\n\n II\n\nIt really looked true moreover from the way Chad was to behave after\nthis. He was full of attentions to his mother’s ambassador; in spite of\nwhich, all the while, the latter’s other relations rather remarkably\ncontrived to assert themselves. Strether’s sittings pen in hand with\nMrs. Newsome up in his own room were broken, yet they were richer; and\nthey were more than ever interspersed with the hours in which he\nreported himself, in a different fashion, but with scarce less\nearnestness and fulness, to Maria Gostrey. Now that, as he would have\nexpressed it, he had really something to talk about he found himself,\nin respect to any oddity that might reside for him in the double\nconnexion, at once more aware and more indifferent. He had been fine to\nMrs. Newsome about his useful friend, but it had begun to haunt his\nimagination that Chad, taking up again for her benefit a pen too long\ndisused, might possibly be finer. It wouldn’t at all do, he saw, that\nanything should come up for him at Chad’s hand but what specifically\n_was_ to have come; the greatest divergence from which would be\nprecisely the element of any lubrication of their intercourse by\nlevity. It was accordingly to forestall such an accident that he\nfrankly put before the young man the several facts, just as they had\noccurred, of his funny alliance. He spoke of these facts, pleasantly\nand obligingly, as “the whole story,” and felt that he might qualify\nthe alliance as funny if he remained sufficiently grave about it. He\nflattered himself that he even exaggerated the wild freedom of his\noriginal encounter with the wonderful lady; he was scrupulously\ndefinite about the absurd conditions in which they had made\nacquaintance—their having picked each other up almost in the street;\nand he had (finest inspiration of all!) a conception of carrying the\nwar into the enemy’s country by showing surprise at the enemy’s\nignorance.\n\nHe had always had a notion that this last was the grand style of\nfighting; the greater therefore the reason for it, as he couldn’t\nremember that he had ever before fought in the grand style. Every one,\naccording to this, knew Miss Gostrey: how came it Chad didn’t know her?\nThe difficulty, the impossibility, was really to escape it; Strether\nput on him, by what he took for granted, the burden of proof of the\ncontrary. This tone was so far successful as that Chad quite appeared\nto recognise her as a person whose fame had reached him, but against\nhis acquaintance with whom much mischance had worked. He made the point\nat the same time that his social relations, such as they could be\ncalled, were perhaps not to the extent Strether supposed with the\nrising flood of their compatriots. He hinted at his having more and\nmore given way to a different principle of selection; the moral of\nwhich seemed to be that he went about little in the “colony.” For the\nmoment certainly he had quite another interest. It was deep, what he\nunderstood, and Strether, for himself, could only so observe it. He\ncouldn’t see as yet how deep. Might he not all too soon! For there was\nreally too much of their question that Chad had already committed\nhimself to liking. He liked, to begin with, his prospective stepfather;\nwhich was distinctly what had not been on the cards. His hating him was\nthe untowardness for which Strether had been best prepared; he hadn’t\nexpected the boy’s actual form to give him more to do than his imputed.\nIt gave him more through suggesting that he must somehow make up to\nhimself for not being sure he was sufficiently disagreeable. That had\nreally been present to him as his only way to be sure he was\nsufficiently thorough. The point was that if Chad’s tolerance of his\nthoroughness were insincere, were but the best of devices for gaining\ntime, it none the less did treat everything as tacitly concluded.\n\nThat seemed at the end of ten days the upshot of the abundant, the\nrecurrent talk through which Strether poured into him all it concerned\nhim to know, put him in full possession of facts and figures. Never\ncutting these colloquies short by a minute, Chad behaved, looked and\nspoke as if he were rather heavily, perhaps even a trifle gloomily, but\nnone the less fundamentally and comfortably free. He made no crude\nprofession of eagerness to yield, but he asked the most intelligent\nquestions, probed, at moments, abruptly, even deeper than his friend’s\nlayer of information, justified by these touches the native estimate of\nhis latent stuff, and had in every way the air of trying to live,\nreflectively, into the square bright picture. He walked up and down in\nfront of this production, sociably took Strether’s arm at the points at\nwhich he stopped, surveyed it repeatedly from the right and from the\nleft, inclined a critical head to either quarter, and, while he puffed\na still more critical cigarette, animadverted to his companion on this\npassage and that. Strether sought relief—there were hours when he\nrequired it—in repeating himself; it was in truth not to be blinked\nthat Chad had a way. The main question as yet was of what it was a way\n_to_. It made vulgar questions no more easy; but that was unimportant\nwhen all questions save those of his own asking had dropped. That he\nwas free was answer enough, and it wasn’t quite ridiculous that this\nfreedom should end by presenting itself as what was difficult to move.\nHis changed state, his lovely home, his beautiful things, his easy\ntalk, his very appetite for Strether, insatiable and, when all was\nsaid, flattering—what were such marked matters all but the notes of his\nfreedom? He had the effect of making a sacrifice of it just in these\nhandsome forms to his visitor; which was mainly the reason the visitor\nwas privately, for the time, a little out of countenance. Strether was\nat this period again and again thrown back on a felt need to remodel\nsomehow his plan. He fairly caught himself shooting rueful glances, shy\nlooks of pursuit, toward the embodied influence, the definite\nadversary, who had by a stroke of her own failed him and on a fond\ntheory of whose palpable presence he had, under Mrs. Newsome’s\ninspiration, altogether proceeded. He had once or twice, in secret,\nliterally expressed the irritated wish that _she_ would come out and\nfind her.\n\nHe couldn’t quite yet force it upon Woollett that such a career, such a\nperverted young life, showed after all a certain plausible side, _did_\nin the case before them flaunt something like an impunity for the\nsocial man; but he could at least treat himself to the statement that\nwould prepare him for the sharpest echo. This echo—as distinct over\nthere in the dry thin air as some shrill “heading” above a column of\nprint—seemed to reach him even as he wrote. “He says there’s no woman,”\nhe could hear Mrs. Newsome report, in capitals almost of newspaper\nsize, to Mrs. Pocock; and he could focus in Mrs. Pocock the response of\nthe reader of the journal. He could see in the younger lady’s face the\nearnestness of her attention and catch the full scepticism of her but\nslightly delayed “What is there then?” Just so he could again as little\nmiss the mother’s clear decision: “There’s plenty of disposition, no\ndoubt, to pretend there isn’t.” Strether had, after posting his letter,\nthe whole scene out; and it was a scene during which, coming and going,\nas befell, he kept his eye not least upon the daughter. He had his fine\nsense of the conviction Mrs. Pocock would take occasion to reaffirm—a\nconviction bearing, as he had from the first deeply divined it to bear,\non Mr. Strether’s essential inaptitude. She had looked him in his\nconscious eyes even before he sailed, and that she didn’t believe _he_\nwould find the woman had been written in her book. Hadn’t she at the\nbest but a scant faith in his ability to find women? It wasn’t even as\nif he had found her mother—so much more, to her discrimination, had her\nmother performed the finding. Her mother had, in a case her private\njudgement of which remained educative of Mrs. Pocock’s critical sense,\nfound the man. The man owed his unchallenged state, in general, to the\nfact that Mrs. Newsome’s discoveries were accepted at Woollett; but he\nknew in his bones, our friend did, how almost irresistibly Mrs. Pocock\nwould now be moved to show what she thought of his own. Give _her_ a\nfree hand, would be the moral, and the woman would soon be found.\n\nHis impression of Miss Gostrey after her introduction to Chad was\nmeanwhile an impression of a person almost unnaturally on her guard. He\nstruck himself as at first unable to extract from her what he wished;\nthough indeed _of_ what he wished at this special juncture he would\ndoubtless have contrived to make but a crude statement. It sifted and\nsettled nothing to put to her, _tout bêtement_, as she often said, “Do\nyou like him, eh?”—thanks to his feeling it actually the least of his\nneeds to heap up the evidence in the young man’s favour. He repeatedly\nknocked at her door to let her have it afresh that Chad’s case—whatever\nelse of minor interest it might yield—was first and foremost a miracle\nalmost monstrous. It was the alteration of the entire man, and was so\nsignal an instance that nothing else, for the intelligent observer,\ncould—_could_ it?—signify. “It’s a plot,” he declared—“there’s more in\nit than meets the eye.” He gave the rein to his fancy. “It’s a plant!”\n\nHis fancy seemed to please her. “Whose then?”\n\n“Well, the party responsible is, I suppose, the fate that waits for\none, the dark doom that rides. What I mean is that with such elements\none can’t count. I’ve but my poor individual, my modest human means. It\nisn’t playing the game to turn on the uncanny. All one’s energy goes to\nfacing it, to tracking it. One wants, confound it, don’t you see?” he\nconfessed with a queer face—“one wants to enjoy anything so rare. Call\nit then life”—he puzzled it out—“call it poor dear old life simply that\nsprings the surprise. Nothing alters the fact that the surprise is\nparalysing, or at any rate engrossing—all, practically, hang it, that\none sees, that one _can_ see.”\n\nHer silences were never barren, nor even dull. “Is that what you’ve\nwritten home?”\n\nHe tossed it off. “Oh dear, yes!”\n\nShe had another pause while, across her carpets, he had another walk.\n“If you don’t look out you’ll have them straight over.”\n\n“Oh but I’ve said he’ll go back.”\n\n“And _will_ he?” Miss Gostrey asked.\n\nThe special tone of it made him, pulling up, look at her long. “What’s\nthat but just the question I’ve spent treasures of patience and\ningenuity in giving _you_, by the sight of him—after everything had led\nup—every facility to answer? What is it but just the thing I came here\nto-day to get out of you? Will he?”\n\n“No—he won’t,” she said at last. “He’s not free.”\n\nThe air of it held him. “Then you’ve all the while known—?”\n\n“I’ve known nothing but what I’ve seen; and I wonder,” she declared\nwith some impatience, “that you didn’t see as much. It was enough to be\nwith him there—”\n\n“In the box? Yes,” he rather blankly urged.\n\n“Well—to feel sure.”\n\n“Sure of what?”\n\nShe got up from her chair, at this, with a nearer approach than she had\never yet shown to dismay at his dimness. She even, fairly pausing for\nit, spoke with a shade of pity. “Guess!”\n\nIt was a shade, fairly, that brought a flush into his face; so that for\na moment, as they waited together, their difference was between them.\n“You mean that just your hour with him told you so much of his story?\nVery good; I’m not such a fool, on my side, as that I don’t understand\nyou, or as that I didn’t in some degree understand _him_. That he has\ndone what he liked most isn’t, among any of us, a matter the least in\ndispute. There’s equally little question at this time of day of what it\nis he does like most. But I’m not talking,” he reasonably explained,\n“of any mere wretch he may still pick up. I’m talking of some person\nwho in his present situation may have held her own, may really have\ncounted.”\n\n“That’s exactly what _I_ am!” said Miss Gostrey. But she as quickly\nmade her point. “I thought you thought—or that they think at\nWoollett—that that’s what mere wretches necessarily do. Mere wretches\nnecessarily _don’t!_” she declared with spirit. “There must, behind\nevery appearance to the contrary, still be somebody—somebody who’s not\na mere wretch, since we accept the miracle. What else but such a\nsomebody can such a miracle be?”\n\nHe took it in. “Because the fact itself _is_ the woman?”\n\n“_A_ woman. Some woman or other. It’s one of the things that _have_ to\nbe.”\n\n“But you mean then at least a good one.”\n\n“A good woman?” She threw up her arms with a laugh. “I should call her\nexcellent!”\n\n“Then why does he deny her?”\n\nMiss Gostrey thought a moment. “Because she’s too good to admit! Don’t\nyou see,” she went on, “how she accounts for him?”\n\nStrether clearly, more and more, did see; yet it made him also see\nother things. “But isn’t what we want that he shall account for _her?_”\n\n“Well, he does. What you have before you is his way. You must forgive\nhim if it isn’t quite outspoken. In Paris such debts are tacit.”\n\nStrether could imagine; but still—! “Even when the woman’s good?”\n\nAgain she laughed out. “Yes, and even when the man is! There’s always a\ncaution in such cases,” she more seriously explained—“for what it may\nseem to show. There’s nothing that’s taken as showing so much here as\nsudden unnatural goodness.”\n\n“Ah then you’re speaking now,” Strether said, “of people who are _not_\nnice.”\n\n“I delight,” she replied, “in your classifications. But do you want\nme,” she asked, “to give you in the matter, on this ground, the wisest\nadvice I’m capable of? Don’t consider her, don’t judge her at all in\nherself. Consider her and judge her only in Chad.”\n\nHe had the courage at least of his companion’s logic. “Because then I\nshall like her?” He almost looked, with his quick imagination as if he\nalready did, though seeing at once also the full extent of how little\nit would suit his book. “But is that what I came out for?”\n\nShe had to confess indeed that it wasn’t. But there was something else.\n“Don’t make up your mind. There are all sorts of things. You haven’t\nseen him all.”\n\nThis on his side Strether recognised; but his acuteness none the less\nshowed him the danger. “Yes, but if the more I see the better he\nseems?”\n\nWell, she found something. “That may be—but his disavowal of her isn’t,\nall the same, pure consideration. There’s a hitch.” She made it out.\n“It’s the effort to sink her.”\n\nStrether winced at the image. “To ‘sink’—?”\n\n“Well, I mean there’s a struggle, and a part of it is just what he\nhides. Take time—that’s the only way not to make some mistake that\nyou’ll regret. Then you’ll see. He does really want to shake her off.”\n\nOur friend had by this time so got into the vision that he almost\ngasped. “After all she has done for him?”\n\nMiss Gostrey gave him a look which broke the next moment into a\nwonderful smile. “He’s not so good as you think!”\n\nThey remained with him, these words, promising him, in their character\nof warning, considerable help; but the support he tried to draw from\nthem found itself on each renewal of contact with Chad defeated by\nsomething else. What could it be, this disconcerting force, he asked\nhimself, but the sense, constantly renewed, that Chad _was_—quite in\nfact insisted on being—as good as he thought? It seemed somehow as if\nhe couldn’t _but_ be as good from the moment he wasn’t as bad. There\nwas a succession of days at all events when contact with him—and in its\nimmediate effect, as if it could produce no other—elbowed out of\nStrether’s consciousness everything but itself. Little Bilham once more\npervaded the scene, but little Bilham became even in a higher degree\nthan he had originally been one of the numerous forms of the inclusive\nrelation; a consequence promoted, to our friend’s sense, by two or\nthree incidents with which we have yet to make acquaintance. Waymarsh\nhimself, for the occasion, was drawn into the eddy; it absolutely,\nthough but temporarily, swallowed him down, and there were days when\nStrether seemed to bump against him as a sinking swimmer might brush a\nsubmarine object. The fathomless medium held them—Chad’s manner was the\nfathomless medium; and our friend felt as if they passed each other, in\ntheir deep immersion, with the round impersonal eye of silent fish. It\nwas practically produced between them that Waymarsh was giving him then\nhis chance; and the shade of discomfort that Strether drew from the\nallowance resembled not a little the embarrassment he had known at\nschool, as a boy, when members of his family had been present at\nexhibitions. He could perform before strangers, but relatives were\nfatal, and it was now as if, comparatively, Waymarsh were a relative.\nHe seemed to hear him say “Strike up then!” and to enjoy a foretaste of\nconscientious domestic criticism. He _had_ struck up, so far as he\nactually could; Chad knew by this time in profusion what he wanted; and\nwhat vulgar violence did his fellow pilgrim expect of him when he had\nreally emptied his mind? It went somehow to and fro that what poor\nWaymarsh meant was “I told you so—that you’d lose your immortal soul!”\nbut it was also fairly explicit that Strether had his own challenge and\nthat, since they must go to the bottom of things, he wasted no more\nvirtue in watching Chad than Chad wasted in watching him. His dip for\nduty’s sake—where was it worse than Waymarsh’s own? For _he_ needn’t\nhave stopped resisting and refusing, needn’t have parleyed, at that\nrate, with the foe.\n\nThe strolls over Paris to see something or call somewhere were\naccordingly inevitable and natural, and the late sessions in the\nwondrous troisième, the lovely home, when men dropped in and the\npicture composed more suggestively through the haze of tobacco, of\nmusic more or less good and of talk more or less polyglot, were on a\nprinciple not to be distinguished from that of the mornings and the\nafternoons. Nothing, Strether had to recognise as he leaned back and\nsmoked, could well less resemble a scene of violence than even the\nliveliest of these occasions. They were occasions of discussion, none\nthe less, and Strether had never in his life heard so many opinions on\nso many subjects. There were opinions at Woollett, but only on three or\nfour. The differences were there to match; if they were doubtless deep,\nthough few, they were quiet—they were, as might be said, almost as shy\nas if people had been ashamed of them. People showed little diffidence\nabout such things, on the other hand, in the Boulevard Malesherbes, and\nwere so far from being ashamed of them—or indeed of anything else—that\nthey often seemed to have invented them to avert those agreements that\ndestroy the taste of talk. No one had ever done that at Woollett,\nthough Strether could remember times when he himself had been tempted\nto it without quite knowing why. He saw why at present—he had but\nwanted to promote intercourse.\n\nThese, however, were but parenthetic memories, and the turn taken by\nhis affair on the whole was positively that if his nerves were on the\nstretch it was because he missed violence. When he asked himself if\nnone would then, in connexion with it, ever come at all, he might\nalmost have passed as wondering how to provoke it. It would be too\nabsurd if such a vision as _that_ should have to be invoked for relief;\nit was already marked enough as absurd that he should actually have\nbegun with flutters and dignities on the score of a single accepted\nmeal. What sort of a brute had he expected Chad to be, anyway?—Strether\nhad occasion to make the enquiry but was careful to make it in private.\nHe could himself, comparatively recent as it was—it was truly but the\nfact of a few days since—focus his primal crudity; but he would on the\napproach of an observer, as if handling an illicit possession, have\nslipped the reminiscence out of sight. There were echoes of it still in\nMrs. Newsome’s letters, and there were moments when these echoes made\nhim exclaim on her want of tact. He blushed of course, at once, still\nmore for the explanation than for the ground of it: it came to him in\ntime to save his manners that she couldn’t at the best become tactful\nas quickly as he. Her tact had to reckon with the Atlantic Ocean, the\nGeneral Post-Office and the extravagant curve of the globe. Chad had\none day offered tea at the Boulevard Malesherbes to a chosen few, a\ngroup again including the unobscured Miss Barrace; and Strether had on\ncoming out walked away with the acquaintance whom in his letters to\nMrs. Newsome he always spoke of as the little artist-man. He had had\nfull occasion to mention him as the other party, so oddly, to the only\nclose personal alliance observation had as yet detected in Chad’s\nexistence. Little Bilham’s way this afternoon was not Strether’s, but\nhe had none the less kindly come with him, and it was somehow a part of\nhis kindness that as it had sadly begun to rain they suddenly found\nthemselves seated for conversation at a café in which they had taken\nrefuge. He had passed no more crowded hour in Chad’s society than the\none just ended; he had talked with Miss Barrace, who had reproached him\nwith not having come to see her, and he had above all hit on a happy\nthought for causing Waymarsh’s tension to relax. Something might\npossibly be extracted for the latter from the idea of his success with\nthat lady, whose quick apprehension of what might amuse her had given\nStrether a free hand. What had she meant if not to ask whether she\ncouldn’t help him with his splendid encumbrance, and mightn’t the\nsacred rage at any rate be kept a little in abeyance by thus creating\nfor his comrade’s mind even in a world of irrelevance the possibility\nof a relation? What was it but a relation to be regarded as so\ndecorative and, in especial, on the strength of it, to be whirled away,\namid flounces and feathers, in a coupé lined, by what Strether could\nmake out, with dark blue brocade? He himself had never been whirled\naway—never at least in a coupé and behind a footman; he had driven with\nMiss Gostrey in cabs, with Mrs. Pocock, a few times, in an open buggy,\nwith Mrs. Newsome in a four-seated cart and, occasionally up at the\nmountains, on a buckboard; but his friend’s actual adventure\ntranscended his personal experience. He now showed his companion soon\nenough indeed how inadequate, as a general monitor, this last queer\nquantity could once more feel itself.\n\n“What game under the sun is he playing?” He signified the next moment\nthat his allusion was not to the fat gentleman immersed in dominoes on\nwhom his eyes had begun by resting, but to their host of the previous\nhour, as to whom, there on the velvet bench, with a final collapse of\nall consistency, he treated himself to the comfort of indiscretion.\n“Where do you see him come out?”\n\nLittle Bilham, in meditation, looked at him with a kindness almost\npaternal. “Don’t you like it over here?”\n\nStrether laughed out—for the tone was indeed droll; he let himself go.\n“What has that to do with it? The only thing I’ve any business to like\nis to feel that I’m moving him. That’s why I ask you whether you\nbelieve I _am?_ Is the creature”—and he did his best to show that he\nsimply wished to ascertain—“honest?”\n\nHis companion looked responsible, but looked it through a small dim\nsmile. “What creature do you mean?”\n\nIt was on this that they did have for a little a mute interchange. “Is\nit untrue that he’s free? How then,” Strether asked wondering “does he\narrange his life?”\n\n“Is the creature you mean Chad himself?” little Bilham said.\n\nStrether here, with a rising hope, just thought, “We must take one of\nthem at a time.” But his coherence lapsed. “_Is_ there some woman? Of\nwhom he’s really afraid of course I mean—or who does with him what she\nlikes.”\n\n“It’s awfully charming of you,” Bilham presently remarked, “not to have\nasked me that before.”\n\n“Oh I’m not fit for my job!”\n\nThe exclamation had escaped our friend, but it made little Bilham more\ndeliberate. “Chad’s a rare case!” he luminously observed. “He’s awfully\nchanged,” he added.\n\n“Then you see it too?”\n\n“The way he has improved? Oh yes—I think every one must see it. But I’m\nnot sure,” said little Bilham, “that I didn’t like him about as well in\nhis other state.”\n\n“Then this _is_ really a new state altogether?”\n\n“Well,” the young man after a moment returned, “I’m not sure he was\nreally meant by nature to be quite so good. It’s like the new edition\nof an old book that one has been fond of—revised and amended, brought\nup to date, but not quite the thing one knew and loved. However that\nmay be at all events,” he pursued, “I don’t think, you know, that he’s\nreally playing, as you call it, any game. I believe he really wants to\ngo back and take up a career. He’s capable of one, you know, that will\nimprove and enlarge him still more. He won’t then,” little Bilham\ncontinued to remark, “be my pleasant well-rubbed old-fashioned volume\nat all. But of course I’m beastly immoral. I’m afraid it would be a\nfunny world altogether—a world with things the way I like them. I\nought, I dare say, to go home and go into business myself. Only I’d\nsimply rather die—simply. And I’ve not the least difficulty in making\nup my mind not to, and in knowing exactly why, and in defending my\nground against all comers. All the same,” he wound up, “I assure you I\ndon’t say a word against it—for himself, I mean—to Chad. I seem to see\nit as much the best thing for him. You see he’s not happy.”\n\n“_Do_ I?”—Strether stared. “I’ve been supposing I see just the\nopposite—an extraordinary case of the equilibrium arrived at and\nassured.”\n\n“Oh there’s a lot behind it.”\n\n“Ah there you are!” Strether exclaimed. “That’s just what I want to get\nat. You speak of your familiar volume altered out of recognition. Well,\nwho’s the editor?”\n\nLittle Bilham looked before him a minute in silence. “He ought to get\nmarried. _That_ would do it. And he wants to.”\n\n“Wants to marry her?”\n\nAgain little Bilham waited, and, with a sense that he had information,\nStrether scarce knew what was coming. “He wants to be free. He isn’t\nused, you see,” the young man explained in his lucid way, “to being so\ngood.”\n\nStrether hesitated. “Then I may take it from you that he _is_ good?”\n\nHis companion matched his pause, but making it up with a quiet fulness.\n“_Do_ take it from me.”\n\n“Well then why isn’t he free? He swears to me he is, but meanwhile does\nnothing—except of course that he’s so kind to me—to prove it; and\ncouldn’t really act much otherwise if he weren’t. My question to you\njust now was exactly on this queer impression of his diplomacy: as if\ninstead of really giving ground his line were to keep me on here and\nset me a bad example.”\n\nAs the half-hour meanwhile had ebbed Strether paid his score, and the\nwaiter was presently in the act of counting out change. Our friend\npushed back to him a fraction of it, with which, after an emphatic\nrecognition, the personage in question retreated. “You give too much,”\nlittle Bilham permitted himself benevolently to observe.\n\n“Oh I always give too much!” Strether helplessly sighed. “But you\ndon’t,” he went on as if to get quickly away from the contemplation of\nthat doom, “answer my question. Why isn’t he free?”\n\nLittle Bilham had got up as if the transaction with the waiter had been\na signal, and had already edged out between the table and the divan.\nThe effect of this was that a minute later they had quitted the place,\nthe gratified waiter alert again at the open door. Strether had found\nhimself deferring to his companion’s abruptness as to a hint that he\nshould be answered as soon as they were more isolated. This happened\nwhen after a few steps in the outer air they had turned the next\ncorner. There our friend had kept it up. “Why isn’t he free if he’s\ngood?”\n\nLittle Bilham looked him full in the face. “Because it’s a virtuous\nattachment.”\n\nThis had settled the question so effectually for the time—that is for\nthe next few days—that it had given Strether almost a new lease of\nlife. It must be added however that, thanks to his constant habit of\nshaking the bottle in which life handed him the wine of experience, he\npresently found the taste of the lees rising as usual into his draught.\nHis imagination had in other words already dealt with his young\nfriend’s assertion; of which it had made something that sufficiently\ncame out on the very next occasion of his seeing Maria Gostrey. This\noccasion moreover had been determined promptly by a new circumstance—a\ncircumstance he was the last man to leave her for a day in ignorance\nof. “When I said to him last night,” he immediately began, “that\nwithout some definite word from him now that will enable me to speak to\nthem over there of our sailing—or at least of mine, giving them some\nsort of date—my responsibility becomes uncomfortable and my situation\nawkward; when I said that to him what do you think was his reply?” And\nthen as she this time gave it up: “Why that he has two particular\nfriends, two ladies, mother and daughter, about to arrive in\nParis—coming back from an absence; and that he wants me so furiously to\nmeet them, know them and like them, that I shall oblige him by kindly\nnot bringing our business to a crisis till he has had a chance to see\nthem again himself. Is that,” Strether enquired, “the way he’s going to\ntry to get off? These are the people,” he explained, “that he must have\ngone down to see before I arrived. They’re the best friends he has in\nthe world, and they take more interest than any one else in what\nconcerns him. As I’m his next best he sees a thousand reasons why we\nshould comfortably meet. He hasn’t broached the question sooner because\ntheir return was uncertain—seemed in fact for the present impossible.\nBut he more than intimates that—if you can believe it—their desire to\nmake my acquaintance has had to do with their surmounting\ndifficulties.”\n\n“They’re dying to see you?” Miss Gostrey asked.\n\n“Dying. Of course,” said Strether, “they’re the virtuous attachment.”\nHe had already told her about that—had seen her the day after his talk\nwith little Bilham; and they had then threshed out together the bearing\nof the revelation. She had helped him to put into it the logic in which\nlittle Bilham had left it slightly deficient Strether hadn’t pressed\nhim as to the object of the preference so unexpectedly described;\nfeeling in the presence of it, with one of his irrepressible scruples,\na delicacy from which he had in the quest of the quite other article\nworked himself sufficiently free. He had held off, as on a small\nprinciple of pride, from permitting his young friend to mention a name;\nwishing to make with this the great point that Chad’s virtuous\nattachments were none of his business. He had wanted from the first not\nto think too much of his dignity, but that was no reason for not\nallowing it any little benefit that might turn up. He had often enough\nwondered to what degree his interference might pass for interested; so\nthat there was no want of luxury in letting it be seen whenever he\ncould that he didn’t interfere. That had of course at the same time not\ndeprived him of the further luxury of much private astonishment; which\nhowever he had reduced to some order before communicating his\nknowledge. When he had done this at last it was with the remark that,\nsurprised as Miss Gostrey might, like himself, at first be, she would\nprobably agree with him on reflexion that such an account of the matter\ndid after all fit the confirmed appearances. Nothing certainly, on all\nthe indications, could have been a greater change for him than a\nvirtuous attachment, and since they had been in search of the “word” as\nthe French called it, of that change, little Bilham’s\nannouncement—though so long and so oddly delayed—would serve as well as\nanother. She had assured Strether in fact after a pause that the more\nshe thought of it the more it did serve; and yet her assurance hadn’t\nso weighed with him as that before they parted he hadn’t ventured to\nchallenge her sincerity. Didn’t she believe the attachment _was_\nvirtuous?—he had made sure of her again with the aid of that question.\nThe tidings he brought her on this second occasion were moreover such\nas would help him to make surer still.\n\nShe showed at first none the less as only amused. “You say there are\ntwo? An attachment to them both then would, I suppose, almost\nnecessarily be innocent.”\n\nOur friend took the point, but he had his clue. “Mayn’t he be still in\nthe stage of not quite knowing which of them, mother or daughter, he\nlikes best?”\n\nShe gave it more thought. “Oh it must be the daughter—at his age.”\n\n“Possibly. Yet what do we know,” Strether asked, “about hers? She may\nbe old enough.”\n\n“Old enough for what?”\n\n“Why to marry Chad. That may be, you know, what they want. And if Chad\nwants it too, and little Bilham wants it, and even _we_, at a pinch,\ncould do with it—that is if she doesn’t prevent repatriation—why it may\nbe plain sailing yet.”\n\nIt was always the case for him in these counsels that each of his\nremarks, as it came, seemed to drop into a deeper well. He had at all\nevents to wait a moment to hear the slight splash of this one. “I don’t\nsee why if Mr. Newsome wants to marry the young lady he hasn’t already\ndone it or hasn’t been prepared with some statement to you about it.\nAnd if he both wants to marry her and is on good terms with them why\nisn’t he ‘free’?”\n\nStrether, responsively, wondered indeed. “Perhaps the girl herself\ndoesn’t like him.”\n\n“Then why does he speak of them to you as he does?”\n\nStrether’s mind echoed the question, but also again met it. “Perhaps\nit’s with the mother he’s on good terms.”\n\n“As against the daughter?”\n\n“Well, if she’s trying to persuade the daughter to consent to him, what\ncould make him like the mother more? Only,” Strether threw out, “why\nshouldn’t the daughter consent to him?”\n\n“Oh,” said Miss Gostrey, “mayn’t it be that every one else isn’t quite\nso struck with him as you?”\n\n“Doesn’t regard him you mean as such an ‘eligible’ young man? _Is_ that\nwhat I’ve come to?” he audibly and rather gravely sought to know.\n“However,” he went on, “his marriage is what his mother most\ndesires—that is if it will help. And oughtn’t _any_ marriage to help?\nThey must want him”—he had already worked it out—“to be better off.\nAlmost any girl he may marry will have a direct interest in his taking\nup his chances. It won’t suit _her_ at least that he shall miss them.”\n\nMiss Gostrey cast about. “No—you reason well! But of course on the\nother hand there’s always dear old Woollett itself.”\n\n“Oh yes,” he mused—“there’s always dear old Woollett itself.”\n\nShe waited a moment. “The young lady mayn’t find herself able to\nswallow _that_ quantity. She may think it’s paying too much; she may\nweigh one thing against another.”\n\nStrether, ever restless in such debates, took a vague turn “It will all\ndepend on who she is. That of course—the proved ability to deal with\ndear old Woollett, since I’m sure she does deal with it—is what makes\nso strongly for Mamie.”\n\n“Mamie?”\n\nHe stopped short, at her tone, before her; then, though seeing that it\nrepresented not vagueness, but a momentary embarrassed fulness, let his\nexclamation come. “You surely haven’t forgotten about Mamie!”\n\n“No, I haven’t forgotten about Mamie,” she smiled. “There’s no doubt\nwhatever that there’s ever so much to be said for her. Mamie’s _my_\ngirl!” she roundly declared.\n\nStrether resumed for a minute his walk. “She’s really perfectly lovely,\nyou know. Far prettier than any girl I’ve seen over here yet.”\n\n“That’s precisely on what I perhaps most build.” And she mused a moment\nin her friend’s way. “I should positively like to take her in hand!”\n\nHe humoured the fancy, though indeed finally to deprecate it. “Oh but\ndon’t, in your zeal, go over to her! I need you most and can’t, you\nknow, be left.”\n\nBut she kept it up. “I wish they’d send her out to me!”\n\n“If they knew you,” he returned, “they would.”\n\n“Ah but don’t they?—after all that, as I’ve understood you you’ve told\nthem about me?”\n\nHe had paused before her again, but he continued his course “They\n_will_—before, as you say, I’ve done.” Then he came out with the point\nhe had wished after all most to make. “It seems to give away now his\ngame. This is what he has been doing—keeping me along for. He has been\nwaiting for them.”\n\nMiss Gostrey drew in her lips. “You see a good deal in it!”\n\n“I doubt if I see as much as you. Do you pretend,” he went on, “that\nyou don’t see—?”\n\n“Well, what?”—she pressed him as he paused.\n\n“Why that there must be a lot between them—and that it has been going\non from the first; even from before I came.”\n\nShe took a minute to answer. “Who are they then—if it’s so grave?”\n\n“It mayn’t be grave—it may be gay. But at any rate it’s marked. Only I\ndon’t know,” Strether had to confess, “anything about them. Their name\nfor instance was a thing that, after little Bilham’s information, I\nfound it a kind of refreshment not to feel obliged to follow up.”\n\n“Oh,” she returned, “if you think you’ve got off—!”\n\nHer laugh produced in him a momentary gloom. “I don’t think I’ve got\noff. I only think I’m breathing for about five minutes. I dare say I\n_shall_ have, at the best, still to get on.” A look, over it all,\npassed between them, and the next minute he had come back to good\nhumour. “I don’t meanwhile take the smallest interest in their name.”\n\n“Nor in their nationality?—American, French, English, Polish?”\n\n“I don’t care the least little ‘hang,’” he smiled, “for their\nnationality. It would be nice if they’re Polish!” he almost immediately\nadded.\n\n“Very nice indeed.” The transition kept up her spirits. “So you see you\ndo care.”\n\nHe did this contention a modified justice. “I think I should if they\n_were_ Polish. Yes,” he thought—“there might be joy in _that_.”\n\n“Let us then hope for it.” But she came after this nearer to the\nquestion. “If the girl’s of the right age of course the mother can’t\nbe. I mean for the virtuous attachment. If the girl’s twenty—and she\ncan’t be less—the mother must be at least forty. So it puts the mother\nout. _She’s_ too old for him.”\n\nStrether, arrested again, considered and demurred. “Do you think so? Do\nyou think any one would be too old for him? _I’m_ eighty, and I’m too\nyoung. But perhaps the girl,” he continued, “_isn’t_ twenty. Perhaps\nshe’s only ten—but such a little dear that Chad finds himself counting\nher in as an attraction of the acquaintance. Perhaps she’s only five.\nPerhaps the mother’s but five-and-twenty—a charming young widow.”\n\nMiss Gostrey entertained the suggestion. “She _is_ a widow then?”\n\n“I haven’t the least idea!” They once more, in spite of this vagueness,\nexchanged a look—a look that was perhaps the longest yet. It seemed in\nfact, the next thing, to require to explain itself; which it did as it\ncould. “I only feel what I’ve told you—that he has some reason.”\n\nMiss Gostrey’s imagination had taken its own flight. “Perhaps she’s\n_not_ a widow.”\n\nStrether seemed to accept the possibility with reserve. Still he\naccepted it. “Then that’s why the attachment—if it’s to her—is\nvirtuous.”\n\nBut she looked as if she scarce followed. “Why is it virtuous if—since\nshe’s free—there’s nothing to impose on it any condition?”\n\nHe laughed at her question. “Oh I perhaps don’t mean as virtuous as\n_that!_ Your idea is that it can be virtuous—in any sense worthy of the\nname—only if she’s _not_ free? But what does it become then,” he asked,\n“for _her?_”\n\n“Ah that’s another matter.” He said nothing for a moment, and she soon\nwent on. “I dare say you’re right, at any rate, about Mr. Newsome’s\nlittle plan. He _has_ been trying you—has been reporting on you to\nthese friends.”\n\nStrether meanwhile had had time to think more. “Then where’s his\nstraightness?”\n\n“Well, as we say, it’s struggling up, breaking out, asserting itself as\nit can. We can be on the side, you see, of his straightness. We can\nhelp him. But he has made out,” said Miss Gostrey, “that you’ll do.”\n\n“Do for what?”\n\n“Why, for _them_—for _ces dames_. He has watched you, studied you,\nliked you—and recognised that _they_ must. It’s a great compliment to\nyou, my dear man; for I’m sure they’re particular. You came out for a\nsuccess. Well,” she gaily declared, “you’re having it!”\n\nHe took it from her with momentary patience and then turned abruptly\naway. It was always convenient to him that there were so many fine\nthings in her room to look at. But the examination of two or three of\nthem appeared soon to have determined a speech that had little to do\nwith them. “You don’t believe in it!”\n\n“In what?”\n\n“In the character of the attachment. In its innocence.”\n\nBut she defended herself. “I don’t pretend to know anything about it.\nEverything’s possible. We must see.”\n\n“See?” he echoed with a groan. “Haven’t we seen enough?”\n\n“_I_ haven’t,” she smiled.\n\n“But do you suppose then little Bilham has lied?”\n\n“You must find out.”\n\nIt made him almost turn pale. “Find out any _more?_”\n\nHe had dropped on a sofa for dismay; but she seemed, as she stood over\nhim, to have the last word. “Wasn’t what you came out for to find out\n_all?_”\n\n\nBook Fifth\n\n\n I\n\nThe Sunday of the next week was a wonderful day, and Chad Newsome had\nlet his friend know in advance that he had provided for it. There had\nalready been a question of his taking him to see the great Gloriani,\nwho was at home on Sunday afternoons and at whose house, for the most\npart, fewer bores were to be met than elsewhere; but the project,\nthrough some accident, had not had instant effect, and now revived in\nhappier conditions. Chad had made the point that the celebrated\nsculptor had a queer old garden, for which the weather—spring at last\nfrank and fair—was propitious; and two or three of his other allusions\nhad confirmed for Strether the expectation of something special. He had\nby this time, for all introductions and adventures, let himself\nrecklessly go, cherishing the sense that whatever the young man showed\nhim he was showing at least himself. He could have wished indeed, so\nfar as this went, that Chad were less of a mere cicerone; for he was\nnot without the impression—now that the vision of his game, his plan,\nhis deep diplomacy, did recurrently assert itself—of his taking refuge\nfrom the realities of their intercourse in profusely dispensing, as our\nfriend mentally phrased it, _panem et circenses_. Our friend continued\nto feel rather smothered in flowers, though he made in his other\nmoments the almost angry inference that this was only because of his\nodious ascetic suspicion of any form of beauty. He periodically assured\nhimself—for his reactions were sharp—that he shouldn’t reach the truth\nof anything till he had at least got rid of that.\n\nHe had known beforehand that Madame de Vionnet and her daughter would\nprobably be on view, an intimation to that effect having constituted\nthe only reference again made by Chad to his good friends from the\nsouth. The effect of Strether’s talk about them with Miss Gostrey had\nbeen quite to consecrate his reluctance to pry; something in the very\nair of Chad’s silence—judged in the light of that talk—offered it to\nhim as a reserve he could markedly match. It shrouded them about with\nhe scarce knew what, a consideration, a distinction; he was in presence\nat any rate—so far as it placed him there—of ladies; and the one thing\nthat was definite for him was that they themselves should be, to the\nextent of his responsibility, in presence of a gentleman. Was it\nbecause they were very beautiful, very clever, or even very good—was it\nfor one of these reasons that Chad was, so to speak, nursing his\neffect? Did he wish to spring them, in the Woollett phrase, with a\nfuller force—to confound his critic, slight though as yet the\ncriticism, with some form of merit exquisitely incalculable? The most\nthe critic had at all events asked was whether the persons in question\nwere French; and that enquiry had been but a proper comment on the\nsound of their name. “Yes. That is no!” had been Chad’s reply; but he\nhad immediately added that their English was the most charming in the\nworld, so that if Strether were wanting an excuse for not getting on\nwith them he wouldn’t in the least find one. Never in fact had\nStrether—in the mood into which the place had quickly launched\nhim—felt, for himself, less the need of an excuse. Those he might have\nfound would have been, at the worst, all for the others, the people\nbefore him, in whose liberty to be as they were he was aware that he\npositively rejoiced. His fellow guests were multiplying, and these\nthings, their liberty, their intensity, their variety, their conditions\nat large, were in fusion in the admirable medium of the scene.\n\nThe place itself was a great impression—a small pavilion, clear-faced\nand sequestered, an effect of polished parquet, of fine white panel and\nspare sallow gilt, of decoration delicate and rare, in the heart of the\nFaubourg Saint-Germain and on the edge of a cluster of gardens attached\nto old noble houses. Far back from streets and unsuspected by crowds,\nreached by a long passage and a quiet court, it was as striking to the\nunprepared mind, he immediately saw, as a treasure dug up; giving him\ntoo, more than anything yet, the note of the range of the immeasurable\ntown and sweeping away, as by a last brave brush, his usual landmarks\nand terms. It was in the garden, a spacious cherished remnant, out of\nwhich a dozen persons had already passed, that Chad’s host presently\nmet them while the tall bird-haunted trees, all of a twitter with the\nspring and the weather, and the high party-walls, on the other side of\nwhich grave _hôtels_ stood off for privacy, spoke of survival,\ntransmission, association, a strong indifferent persistent order. The\nday was so soft that the little party had practically adjourned to the\nopen air but the open air was in such conditions all a chamber of\nstate. Strether had presently the sense of a great convent, a convent\nof missions, famous for he scarce knew what, a nursery of young\npriests, of scattered shade, of straight alleys and chapel-bells, that\nspread its mass in one quarter; he had the sense of names in the air,\nof ghosts at the windows, of signs and tokens, a whole range of\nexpression, all about him, too thick for prompt discrimination.\n\nThis assault of images became for a moment, in the address of the\ndistinguished sculptor, almost formidable: Gloriani showed him, in such\nperfect confidence, on Chad’s introduction of him, a fine worn handsome\nface, a face that was like an open letter in a foreign tongue. With his\ngenius in his eyes, his manners on his lips, his long career behind him\nand his honours and rewards all round, the great artist, in the course\nof a single sustained look and a few words of delight at receiving him,\naffected our friend as a dazzling prodigy of type. Strether had seen in\nmuseums—in the Luxembourg as well as, more reverently, later on, in the\nNew York of the billionaires—the work of his hand; knowing too that\nafter an earlier time in his native Rome he had migrated, in\nmid-career, to Paris, where, with a personal lustre almost violent, he\nshone in a constellation: all of which was more than enough to crown\nhim, for his guest, with the light, with the romance, of glory.\nStrether, in contact with that element as he had never yet so\nintimately been, had the consciousness of opening to it, for the happy\ninstant, all the windows of his mind, of letting this rather grey\ninterior drink in for once the sun of a clime not marked in his old\ngeography. He was to remember again repeatedly the medal-like Italian\nface, in which every line was an artist’s own, in which time told only\nas tone and consecration; and he was to recall in especial, as the\npenetrating radiance, as the communication of the illustrious spirit\nitself, the manner in which, while they stood briefly, in welcome and\nresponse, face to face, he was held by the sculptor’s eyes. He wasn’t\nsoon to forget them, was to think of them, all unconscious,\nunintending, preoccupied though they were, as the source of the deepest\nintellectual sounding to which he had ever been exposed. He was in fact\nquite to cherish his vision of it, to play with it in idle hours; only\nspeaking of it to no one and quite aware he couldn’t have spoken\nwithout appearing to talk nonsense. Was what it had told him or what it\nhad asked him the greater of the mysteries? Was it the most special\nflare, unequalled, supreme, of the æsthetic torch, lighting that\nwondrous world for ever, or was it above all the long straight shaft\nsunk by a personal acuteness that life had seasoned to steel? Nothing\non earth could have been stranger and no one doubtless more surprised\nthan the artist himself, but it was for all the world to Strether just\nthen as if in the matter of his accepted duty he had positively been on\ntrial. The deep human expertness in Gloriani’s charming smile—oh the\nterrible life behind it!—was flashed upon him as a test of his stuff.\n\nChad meanwhile, after having easily named his companion, had still more\neasily turned away and was already greeting other persons present. He\nwas as easy, clever Chad, with the great artist as with his obscure\ncompatriot, and as easy with every one else as with either: this fell\ninto its place for Strether and made almost a new light, giving him, as\na concatenation, something more he could enjoy. He liked Gloriani, but\nshould never see him again; of that he was sufficiently sure. Chad\naccordingly, who was wonderful with both of them, was a kind of link\nfor hopeless fancy, an implication of possibilities—oh if everything\nhad been different! Strether noted at all events that he was thus on\nterms with illustrious spirits, and also that—yes, distinctly—he hadn’t\nin the least swaggered about it. Our friend hadn’t come there only for\nthis figure of Abel Newsome’s son, but that presence threatened to\naffect the observant mind as positively central. Gloriani indeed,\nremembering something and excusing himself, pursued Chad to speak to\nhim, and Strether was left musing on many things. One of them was the\nquestion of whether, since he had been tested, he had passed. Did the\nartist drop him from having made out that he wouldn’t do? He really\nfelt just to-day that he might do better than usual. Hadn’t he done\nwell enough, so far as that went, in being exactly so dazzled? and in\nnot having too, as he almost believed, wholly hidden from his host that\nhe felt the latter’s plummet? Suddenly, across the garden, he saw\nlittle Bilham approach, and it was a part of the fit that was on him\nthat as their eyes met he guessed also _his_ knowledge. If he had said\nto him on the instant what was uppermost he would have said: “_Have_ I\npassed?—for of course I know one has to pass here.” Little Bilham would\nhave reassured him, have told him that he exaggerated, and have adduced\nhappily enough the argument of little Bilham’s own very presence;\nwhich, in truth, he could see, was as easy a one as Gloriani’s own or\nas Chad’s. He himself would perhaps then after a while cease to be\nfrightened, would get the point of view for some of the faces—types\ntremendously alien, alien to Woollett—that he had already begun to take\nin. Who were they all, the dispersed groups and couples, the ladies\neven more unlike those of Woollett than the gentlemen?—this was the\nenquiry that, when his young friend had greeted him, he did find\nhimself making.\n\n“Oh they’re every one—all sorts and sizes; of course I mean within\nlimits, though limits down perhaps rather more than limits up. There\nare always artists—he’s beautiful and inimitable to the _cher\nconfrère_; and then _gros bonnets_ of many kinds—ambassadors, cabinet\nministers, bankers, generals, what do I know? even Jews. Above all\nalways some awfully nice women—and not too many; sometimes an actress,\nan artist, a great performer—but only when they’re not monsters; and in\nparticular the right _femmes du monde_. You can fancy his history on\nthat side—I believe it’s fabulous: they _never_ give him up. Yet he\nkeeps them down: no one knows how he manages; it’s too beautiful and\nbland. Never too many—and a mighty good thing too; just a perfect\nchoice. But there are not in any way many bores; it has always been so;\nhe has some secret. It’s extraordinary. And you don’t find it out. He’s\nthe same to every one. He doesn’t ask questions.’\n\n“Ah doesn’t he?” Strether laughed.\n\nBilham met it with all his candour. “How then should _I_ be here?\n\n“Oh for what you tell me. You’re part of the perfect choice.”\n\nWell, the young man took in the scene. “It seems rather good to-day.”\n\nStrether followed the direction of his eyes. “Are they all, this time,\n_femmes du monde?_”\n\nLittle Bilham showed his competence. “Pretty well.”\n\nThis was a category our friend had a feeling for; a light, romantic and\nmysterious, on the feminine element, in which he enjoyed for a little\nwatching it. “Are there any Poles?”\n\nHis companion considered. “I think I make out a ‘Portuguee.’ But I’ve\nseen Turks.”\n\nStrether wondered, desiring justice. “They seem—all the women—very\nharmonious.”\n\n“Oh in closer quarters they come out!” And then, while Strether was\naware of fearing closer quarters, though giving himself again to the\nharmonies, “Well,” little Bilham went on, “it _is_ at the worst rather\ngood, you know. If you like it, you feel it, this way, that shows\nyou’re not in the least out. But you always know things,” he handsomely\nadded, “immediately.”\n\nStrether liked it and felt it only too much; so “I say, don’t lay traps\nfor me!” he rather helplessly murmured.\n\n“Well,” his companion returned, “he’s wonderfully kind to _us_.”\n\n“To us Americans you mean?”\n\n“Oh no—he doesn’t know anything about _that_. That’s half the battle\nhere—that you can never hear politics. We don’t talk them. I mean to\npoor young wretches of all sorts. And yet it’s always as charming as\nthis; it’s as if, by something in the air, our squalor didn’t show. It\nputs us all back—into the last century.”\n\n“I’m afraid,” Strether said, amused, “that it puts me rather forward:\noh ever so far!”\n\n“Into the next? But isn’t that only,” little Bilham asked, “because\nyou’re really of the century before?”\n\n“The century before the last? Thank you!” Strether laughed. “If I ask\nyou about some of the ladies it can’t be then that I may hope, as such\na specimen of the rococo, to please them.”\n\n“On the contrary they adore—we all adore here—the rococo, and where is\nthere a better setting for it than the whole thing, the pavilion and\nthe garden, together? There are lots of people with collections,”\nlittle Bilham smiled as he glanced round. “You’ll be secured!”\n\nIt made Strether for a moment give himself again to contemplation.\nThere were faces he scarce knew what to make of. Were they charming or\nwere they only strange? He mightn’t talk politics, yet he suspected a\nPole or two. The upshot was the question at the back of his head from\nthe moment his friend had joined him. “Have Madame de Vionnet and her\ndaughter arrived?”\n\n“I haven’t seen them yet, but Miss Gostrey has come. She’s in the\npavilion looking at objects. One can see _she’s_ a collector,” little\nBilham added without offence.\n\n“Oh yes, she’s a collector, and I knew she was to come. Is Madame de\nVionnet a collector?” Strether went on.\n\n“Rather, I believe; almost celebrated.” The young man met, on it, a\nlittle, his friend’s eyes. “I happen to know—from Chad, whom I saw last\nnight—that they’ve come back; but only yesterday. He wasn’t sure—up to\nthe last. This, accordingly,” little Bilham went on, “will be—if they\n_are_ here—their first appearance after their return.”\n\nStrether, very quickly, turned these things over. “Chad told you last\nnight? To me, on our way here, he said nothing about it.”\n\n“But did you ask him?”\n\nStrether did him the justice. “I dare say not.”\n\n“Well,” said little Bilham, “you’re not a person to whom it’s easy to\ntell things you don’t want to know. Though it _is_ easy, I admit—it’s\nquite beautiful,” he benevolently added, “when you do want to.”\n\nStrether looked at him with an indulgence that matched his\nintelligence. “Is that the deep reasoning on which—about these\nladies—you’ve been yourself so silent?”\n\nLittle Bilham considered the depth of his reasoning. “I haven’t been\nsilent. I spoke of them to you the other day, the day we sat together\nafter Chad’s tea-party.”\n\nStrether came round to it. “They then are the virtuous attachment?”\n\n“I can only tell you that it’s what they pass for. But isn’t that\nenough? What more than a vain appearance does the wisest of us know? I\ncommend you,” the young man declared with a pleasant emphasis, “the\nvain appearance.”\n\nStrether looked more widely round, and what he saw, from face to face,\ndeepened the effect of his young friend’s words. “Is it so good?”\n\n“Magnificent.”\n\nStrether had a pause. “The husband’s dead?”\n\n“Dear no. Alive.”\n\n“Oh!” said Strether. After which, as his companion laughed: “How then\ncan it be so good?”\n\n“You’ll see for yourself. One does see.”\n\n“Chad’s in love with the daughter?”\n\n“That’s what I mean.”\n\nStrether wondered. “Then where’s the difficulty?”\n\n“Why, aren’t you and I—with our grander bolder ideas?”\n\n“Oh mine—!” Strether said rather strangely. But then as if to\nattenuate: “You mean they won’t hear of Woollett?”\n\nLittle Bilham smiled. “Isn’t that just what you must see about?”\n\nIt had brought them, as she caught the last words, into relation with\nMiss Barrace, whom Strether had already observed—as he had never before\nseen a lady at a party—moving about alone. Coming within sound of them\nshe had already spoken, and she took again, through her long-handled\nglass, all her amused and amusing possession. “How much, poor Mr.\nStrether, you seem to have to see about! But you can’t say,” she gaily\ndeclared, “that I don’t do what I can to help you. Mr. Waymarsh is\nplaced. I’ve left him in the house with Miss Gostrey.”\n\n“The way,” little Bilham exclaimed, “Mr. Strether gets the ladies to\nwork for him! He’s just preparing to draw in another; to pounce—don’t\nyou see him?—on Madame de Vionnet.”\n\n“Madame de Vionnet? Oh, oh, oh!” Miss Barrace cried in a wonderful\ncrescendo. There was more in it, our friend made out, than met the ear.\nWas it after all a joke that he should be serious about anything? He\nenvied Miss Barrace at any rate her power of not being. She seemed,\nwith little cries and protests and quick recognitions, movements like\nthe darts of some fine high-feathered free-pecking bird, to stand\nbefore life as before some full shop-window. You could fairly hear, as\nshe selected and pointed, the tap of her tortoise-shell against the\nglass. “It’s certain that we do need seeing about; only I’m glad it’s\nnot I who have to do it. One does, no doubt, begin that way; then\nsuddenly one finds that one has given it up. It’s too much, it’s too\ndifficult. You’re wonderful, you people,” she continued to Strether,\n“for not feeling those things—by which I mean impossibilities. You\nnever feel them. You face them with a fortitude that makes it a lesson\nto watch you.”\n\n“Ah but”—little Bilham put it with discouragement—“what do we achieve\nafter all? We see about you and report—when we even go so far as\nreporting. But nothing’s done.”\n\n“Oh you, Mr. Bilham,” she replied as with an impatient rap on the\nglass, “you’re not worth sixpence! You come over to convert the\nsavages—for I know you verily did, I remember you—and the savages\nsimply convert _you_.”\n\n“Not even!” the young man woefully confessed: “they haven’t gone\nthrough that form. They’ve simply—the cannibals!—eaten me; converted me\nif you like, but converted me into food. I’m but the bleached bones of\na Christian.”\n\n“Well then there we are! Only”—and Miss Barrace appealed again to\nStrether—“don’t let it discourage you. You’ll break down soon enough,\nbut you’ll meanwhile have had your moments. _Il faut en avoir_. I\nalways like to see you while you last. And I’ll tell you who _will_\nlast.”\n\n“Waymarsh?”—he had already taken her up.\n\nShe laughed out as at the alarm of it. “He’ll resist even Miss Gostrey:\nso grand is it not to understand. He’s wonderful.”\n\n“He is indeed,” Strether conceded. “He wouldn’t tell me of this\naffair—only said he had an engagement; but with such a gloom, you must\nlet me insist, as if it had been an engagement to be hanged. Then\nsilently and secretly he turns up here with you. Do you call _that_\n‘lasting’?”\n\n“Oh I hope it’s lasting!” Miss Barrace said. “But he only, at the best,\nbears with me. He doesn’t understand—not one little scrap. He’s\ndelightful. He’s wonderful,” she repeated.\n\n“Michelangelesque!”—little Bilham completed her meaning. “He _is_ a\nsuccess. Moses, on the ceiling, brought down to the floor;\noverwhelming, colossal, but somehow portable.”\n\n“Certainly, if you mean by portable,” she returned, “looking so well in\none’s carriage. He’s too funny beside me in his corner; he looks like\nsomebody, somebody foreign and famous, _en exil_; so that people\nwonder—it’s very amusing—whom I’m taking about. I show him Paris, show\nhim everything, and he never turns a hair. He’s like the Indian chief\none reads about, who, when he comes up to Washington to see the Great\nFather, stands wrapt in his blanket and gives no sign. _I_ might be the\nGreat Father—from the way he takes everything.” She was delighted at\nthis hit of her identity with that personage—it fitted so her\ncharacter; she declared it was the title she meant henceforth to adopt.\n“And the way he sits, too, in the corner of my room, only looking at my\nvisitors very hard and as if he wanted to start something! They wonder\nwhat he does want to start. But he’s wonderful,” Miss Barrace once more\ninsisted. “He has never started anything yet.”\n\nIt presented him none the less, in truth, to her actual friends, who\nlooked at each other in intelligence, with frank amusement on Bilham’s\npart and a shade of sadness on Strether’s. Strether’s sadness\nsprang—for the image had its grandeur—from his thinking how little he\nhimself was wrapt in his blanket, how little, in marble halls, all too\noblivious of the Great Father, he resembled a really majestic\naboriginal. But he had also another reflexion. “You’ve all of you here\nso much visual sense that you’ve somehow all ‘run’ to it. There are\nmoments when it strikes one that you haven’t any other.”\n\n“Any moral,” little Bilham explained, watching serenely, across the\ngarden, the several _femmes du monde_. “But Miss Barrace has a moral\ndistinction,” he kindly continued; speaking as if for Strether’s\nbenefit not less than for her own.\n\n“_Have_ you?” Strether, scarce knowing what he was about, asked of her\nalmost eagerly.\n\n“Oh not a distinction”—she was mightily amused at his tone—“Mr.\nBilham’s too good. But I think I may say a sufficiency. Yes, a\nsufficiency. Have you supposed strange things of me?”—and she fixed him\nagain, through all her tortoise-shell, with the droll interest of it.\n“You _are_ all indeed wonderful. I should awfully disappoint you. I do\ntake my stand on my sufficiency. But I know, I confess,” she went on,\n“strange people. I don’t know how it happens; I don’t do it on purpose;\nit seems to be my doom—as if I were always one of their habits: it’s\nwonderful! I dare say moreover,” she pursued with an interested\ngravity, “that I do, that we all do here, run too much to mere eye. But\nhow can it be helped? We’re all looking at each other—and in the light\nof Paris one sees what things resemble. That’s what the light of Paris\nseems always to show. It’s the fault of the light of Paris—dear old\nlight!”\n\n“Dear old Paris!” little Bilham echoed.\n\n“Everything, every one shows,” Miss Barrace went on.\n\n“But for what they really are?” Strether asked.\n\n“Oh I like your Boston ‘reallys’! But sometimes—yes.”\n\n“Dear old Paris then!” Strether resignedly sighed while for a moment\nthey looked at each other. Then he broke out: “Does Madame de Vionnet\ndo that? I mean really show for what she is?”\n\nHer answer was prompt. “She’s charming. She’s perfect.”\n\n“Then why did you a minute ago say ‘Oh, oh, oh!’ at her name?”\n\nShe easily remembered. “Why just because—! She’s wonderful.”\n\n“Ah she too?”—Strether had almost a groan.\n\nBut Miss Barrace had meanwhile perceived relief. “Why not put your\nquestion straight to the person who can answer it best?”\n\n“No,” said little Bilham; “don’t put any question; wait, rather—it will\nbe much more fun—to judge for yourself. He has come to take you to\nher.”\n\n\n II\n\nOn which Strether saw that Chad was again at hand, and he afterwards\nscarce knew, absurd as it may seem, what had then quickly occurred. The\nmoment concerned him, he felt, more deeply than he could have\nexplained, and he had a subsequent passage of speculation as to\nwhether, on walking off with Chad, he hadn’t looked either pale or red.\nThe only thing he was clear about was that, luckily, nothing indiscreet\nhad in fact been said and that Chad himself was more than ever, in Miss\nBarrace’s great sense, wonderful. It was one of the connexions—though\nreally why it should be, after all, was none so apparent—in which the\nwhole change in him came out as most striking. Strether recalled as\nthey approached the house that he had impressed him that first night as\nknowing how to enter a box. Well, he impressed him scarce less now as\nknowing how to make a presentation. It did something for Strether’s own\nquality—marked it as estimated; so that our poor friend, conscious and\npassive, really seemed to feel himself quite handed over and delivered;\nabsolutely, as he would have said, made a present of, given away. As\nthey reached the house a young woman, about to come forth, appeared,\nunaccompanied, on the steps; at the exchange with whom of a word on\nChad’s part Strether immediately perceived that, obligingly, kindly,\nshe was there to meet them. Chad had left her in the house, but she had\nafterwards come halfway and then the next moment had joined them in the\ngarden. Her air of youth, for Strether, was at first almost\ndisconcerting, while his second impression was, not less sharply, a\ndegree of relief at there not having just been, with the others, any\nfreedom used about her. It was upon him at a touch that she was no\nsubject for that, and meanwhile, on Chad’s introducing him, she had\nspoken to him, very simply and gently, in an English clearly of the\neasiest to her, yet unlike any other he had ever heard. It wasn’t as if\nshe tried; nothing, he could see after they had been a few minutes\ntogether, was as if she tried; but her speech, charming correct and\nodd, was like a precaution against her passing for a Pole. There were\nprecautions, he seemed indeed to see, only when there were really\ndangers.\n\nLater on he was to feel many more of them, but by that time he was to\nfeel other things besides. She was dressed in black, but in black that\nstruck him as light and transparent; she was exceedingly fair, and,\nthough she was as markedly slim, her face had a roundness, with eyes\nfar apart and a little strange. Her smile was natural and dim; her hat\nnot extravagant; he had only perhaps a sense of the clink, beneath her\nfine black sleeves, of more gold bracelets and bangles than he had ever\nseen a lady wear. Chad was excellently free and light about their\nencounter; it was one of the occasions on which Strether most wished he\nhimself might have arrived at such ease and such humour: “Here you are\nthen, face to face at last; you’re made for each other—_vous allez\nvoir_; and I bless your union.” It was indeed, after he had gone off,\nas if he had been partly serious too. This latter motion had been\ndetermined by an enquiry from him about “Jeanne”; to which her mother\nhad replied that she was probably still in the house with Miss Gostrey,\nto whom she had lately committed her. “Ah but you know,” the young man\nhad rejoined, “he must see her”; with which, while Strether pricked up\nhis ears, he had started as if to bring her, leaving the other objects\nof his interest together. Strether wondered to find Miss Gostrey\nalready involved, feeling that he missed a link; but feeling also, with\nsmall delay, how much he should like to talk with her of Madame de\nVionnet on this basis of evidence.\n\nThe evidence as yet in truth was meagre; which, for that matter, was\nperhaps a little why his expectation had had a drop. There was somehow\nnot quite a wealth in her; and a wealth was all that, in his\nsimplicity, he had definitely prefigured. Still, it was too much to be\nsure already that there was but a poverty. They moved away from the\nhouse, and, with eyes on a bench at some distance, he proposed that\nthey should sit down. “I’ve heard a great deal about you,” she said as\nthey went; but he had an answer to it that made her stop short. “Well,\nabout _you_, Madame de Vionnet, I’ve heard, I’m bound to say, almost\nnothing”—those struck him as the only words he himself could utter with\nany lucidity; conscious as he was, and as with more reason, of the\ndetermination to be in respect to the rest of his business perfectly\nplain and go perfectly straight. It hadn’t at any rate been in the\nleast his idea to spy on Chad’s proper freedom. It was possibly,\nhowever, at this very instant and under the impression of Madame de\nVionnet’s pause, that going straight began to announce itself as a\nmatter for care. She had only after all to smile at him ever so gently\nin order to make him ask himself if he weren’t already going crooked.\nIt might be going crooked to find it of a sudden just only clear that\nshe intended very definitely to be what he would have called nice to\nhim. This was what passed between them while, for another instant, they\nstood still; he couldn’t at least remember afterwards what else it\nmight have been. The thing indeed really unmistakeable was its rolling\nover him as a wave that he had been, in conditions incalculable and\nunimaginable, a subject of discussion. He had been, on some ground that\nconcerned her, answered for; which gave her an advantage he should\nnever be able to match.\n\n“Hasn’t Miss Gostrey,” she asked, “said a good word for me?”\n\nWhat had struck him first was the way he was bracketed with that lady;\nand he wondered what account Chad would have given of their\nacquaintance. Something not as yet traceable, at all events, had\nobviously happened. “I didn’t even know of her knowing you.”\n\n“Well, now she’ll tell you all. I’m so glad you’re in relation with\nher.”\n\nThis was one of the things—the “all” Miss Gostrey would now tell\nhim—that, with every deference to present preoccupation, was uppermost\nfor Strether after they had taken their seat. One of the others was, at\nthe end of five minutes, that she—oh incontestably, yes—_differed_\nless; differed, that is, scarcely at all—well, superficially speaking,\nfrom Mrs. Newsome or even from Mrs. Pocock. She was ever so much\nyounger than the one and not so young as the other; but what _was_\nthere in her, if anything, that would have made it impossible he should\nmeet her at Woollett? And wherein was her talk during their moments on\nthe bench together not the same as would have been found adequate for a\nWoollett garden-party?—unless perhaps truly in not being quite so\nbright. She observed to him that Mr. Newsome had, to her knowledge,\ntaken extraordinary pleasure in his visit; but there was no good lady\nat Woollett who wouldn’t have been at least up to that. Was there in\nChad, by chance, after all, deep down, a principle of aboriginal\nloyalty that had made him, for sentimental ends, attach himself to\nelements, happily encountered, that would remind him most of the old\nair and the old soil? Why accordingly be in a flutter—Strether could\neven put it that way—about this unfamiliar phenomenon of the _femme du\nmonde?_ On these terms Mrs. Newsome herself was as much of one. Little\nBilham verily had testified that they came out, the ladies of the type,\nin close quarters; but it was just in these quarters—now comparatively\nclose—that he felt Madame de Vionnet’s common humanity. She did come\nout, and certainly to his relief, but she came out as the usual thing.\nThere might be motives behind, but so could there often be even at\nWoollett. The only thing was that if she showed him she wished to like\nhim—as the motives behind might conceivably prompt—it would possibly\nhave been more thrilling for him that she should have shown as more\nvividly alien. Ah she was neither Turk nor Pole!—which would be indeed\nflat once more for Mrs. Newsome and Mrs. Pocock. A lady and two\ngentlemen had meanwhile, however, approached their bench, and this\naccident stayed for the time further developments.\n\nThey presently addressed his companion, the brilliant strangers; she\nrose to speak to them, and Strether noted how the escorted lady, though\nmature and by no means beautiful, had more of the bold high look, the\nrange of expensive reference, that he had, as might have been said,\nmade his plans for. Madame de Vionnet greeted her as “Duchesse” and was\ngreeted in turn, while talk started in French, as “Ma toute-belle”;\nlittle facts that had their due, their vivid interest for Strether.\nMadame de Vionnet didn’t, none the less, introduce him—a note he was\nconscious of as false to the Woollett scale and the Woollett humanity;\nthough it didn’t prevent the Duchess, who struck him as confident and\nfree, very much what he had obscurely supposed duchesses, from looking\nat him as straight and as hard—for it _was_ hard—as if she would have\nliked, all the same, to know him. “Oh yes, my dear, it’s all right,\nit’s _me_; and who are _you_, with your interesting wrinkles and your\nmost effective (is it the handsomest, is it the ugliest?) of\nnoses?”—some such loose handful of bright flowers she seemed,\nfragrantly enough, to fling at him. Strether almost wondered—at such a\npace was he going—if some divination of the influence of either party\nwere what determined Madame de Vionnet’s abstention. One of the\ngentlemen, in any case, succeeded in placing himself in close relation\nwith our friend’s companion; a gentleman rather stout and importantly\nshort, in a hat with a wonderful wide curl to its brim and a frock coat\nbuttoned with an effect of superlative decision. His French had quickly\nturned to equal English, and it occurred to Strether that he might well\nbe one of the ambassadors. His design was evidently to assert a claim\nto Madame de Vionnet’s undivided countenance, and he made it good in\nthe course of a minute—led her away with a trick of three words; a\ntrick played with a social art of which Strether, looking after them as\nthe four, whose backs were now all turned, moved off, felt himself no\nmaster.\n\nHe sank again upon his bench and, while his eyes followed the party,\nreflected, as he had done before, on Chad’s strange communities. He sat\nthere alone for five minutes, with plenty to think of; above all with\nhis sense of having suddenly been dropped by a charming woman overlaid\nnow by other impressions and in fact quite cleared and indifferent. He\nhadn’t yet had so quiet a surrender; he didn’t in the least care if\nnobody spoke to him more. He might have been, by his attitude, in for\nsomething of a march so broad that the want of ceremony with which he\nhad just been used could fall into its place as but a minor incident of\nthe procession. Besides, there would be incidents enough, as he felt\nwhen this term of contemplation was closed by the reappearance of\nlittle Bilham, who stood before him a moment with a suggestive “Well?”\nin which he saw himself reflected as disorganised, as possibly floored.\nHe replied with a “Well!” intended to show that he wasn’t floored in\nthe least. No indeed; he gave it out, as the young man sat down beside\nhim, that if, at the worst, he had been overturned at all, he had been\noverturned into the upper air, the sublimer element with which he had\nan affinity and in which he might be trusted a while to float. It\nwasn’t a descent to earth to say after an instant and in sustained\nresponse to the reference: “You’re quite sure her husband’s living?”\n\n“Oh dear, yes.”\n\n“Ah then—!”\n\n“Ah then what?”\n\nStrether had after all to think. “Well, I’m sorry for them.” But it\ndidn’t for the moment matter more than that. He assured his young\nfriend he was quite content. They wouldn’t stir; were all right as they\nwere. He didn’t want to be introduced; had been introduced already\nabout as far as he could go. He had seen moreover an immensity; liked\nGloriani, who, as Miss Barrace kept saying, was wonderful; had made\nout, he was sure, the half-dozen other men who were distinguished, the\nartists, the critics and oh the great dramatist—_him_ it was easy to\nspot; but wanted—no, thanks, really—to talk with none of them; having\nnothing at all to say and finding it would do beautifully as it was; do\nbeautifully because what it was—well, was just simply too late. And\nwhen after this little Bilham, submissive and responsive, but with an\neye to the consolation nearest, easily threw off some “Better late than\nnever!” all he got in return for it was a sharp “Better early than\nlate!” This note indeed the next thing overflowed for Strether into a\nquiet stream of demonstration that as soon as he had let himself go he\nfelt as the real relief. It had consciously gathered to a head, but the\nreservoir had filled sooner than he knew, and his companion’s touch was\nto make the waters spread. There were some things that had to come in\ntime if they were to come at all. If they didn’t come in time they were\nlost for ever. It was the general sense of them that had overwhelmed\nhim with its long slow rush.\n\n“It’s not too late for _you_, on any side, and you don’t strike me as\nin danger of missing the train; besides which people can be in general\npretty well trusted, of course—with the clock of their freedom ticking\nas loud as it seems to do here—to keep an eye on the fleeting hour. All\nthe same don’t forget that you’re young—blessedly young; be glad of it\non the contrary and live up to it. Live all you can; it’s a mistake not\nto. It doesn’t so much matter what you do in particular, so long as you\nhave your life. If you haven’t had that what _have_ you had? This place\nand these impressions—mild as you may find them to wind a man up so;\nall my impressions of Chad and of people I’ve seen at _his_ place—well,\nhave had their abundant message for me, have just dropped _that_ into\nmy mind. I see it now. I haven’t done so enough before—and now I’m old;\ntoo old at any rate for what I see. Oh I _do_ see, at least; and more\nthan you’d believe or I can express. It’s too late. And it’s as if the\ntrain had fairly waited at the station for me without my having had the\ngumption to know it was there. Now I hear its faint receding whistle\nmiles and miles down the line. What one loses one loses; make no\nmistake about that. The affair—I mean the affair of life—couldn’t, no\ndoubt, have been different for me; for it’s at the best a tin mould,\neither fluted and embossed, with ornamental excrescences, or else\nsmooth and dreadfully plain, into which, a helpless jelly, one’s\nconsciousness is poured—so that one ‘takes’ the form as the great cook\nsays, and is more or less compactly held by it: one lives in fine as\none can. Still, one has the illusion of freedom; therefore don’t be,\nlike me, without the memory of that illusion. I was either, at the\nright time, too stupid or too intelligent to have it; I don’t quite\nknow which. Of course at present I’m a case of reaction against the\nmistake; and the voice of reaction should, no doubt, always be taken\nwith an allowance. But that doesn’t affect the point that the right\ntime is now yours. The right time is _any_ time that one is still so\nlucky as to have. You’ve plenty; that’s the great thing; you’re, as I\nsay, damn you, so happily and hatefully young. Don’t at any rate miss\nthings out of stupidity. Of course I don’t take you for a fool, or I\nshouldn’t be addressing you thus awfully. Do what you like so long as\nyou don’t make _my_ mistake. For it was a mistake. Live!” ... Slowly\nand sociably, with full pauses and straight dashes, Strether had so\ndelivered himself; holding little Bilham from step to step deeply and\ngravely attentive. The end of all was that the young man had turned\nquite solemn, and that this was a contradiction of the innocent gaiety\nthe speaker had wished to promote. He watched for a moment the\nconsequence of his words, and then, laying a hand on his listener’s\nknee and as if to end with the proper joke: “And now for the eye I\nshall keep on you!”\n\n“Oh but I don’t know that I want to be, at your age, too different from\nyou!”\n\n“Ah prepare while you’re about it,” said Strether, “to be more\namusing.”\n\nLittle Bilham continued to think, but at last had a smile. “Well, you\n_are_ amusing—to _me_.”\n\n“_Impayable_, as you say, no doubt. But what am I to myself?” Strether\nhad risen with this, giving his attention now to an encounter that, in\nthe middle of the garden, was in the act of taking place between their\nhost and the lady at whose side Madame de Vionnet had quitted him. This\nlady, who appeared within a few minutes to have left her friends,\nawaited Gloriani’s eager approach with words on her lips that Strether\ncouldn’t catch, but of which her interesting witty face seemed to give\nhim the echo. He was sure she was prompt and fine, but also that she\nhad met her match, and he liked—in the light of what he was quite sure\nwas the Duchess’s latent insolence—the good humour with which the great\nartist asserted equal resources. Were they, this pair, of the “great\nworld”?—and was he himself, for the moment and thus related to them by\nhis observation, _in_ it? Then there was something in the great world\ncovertly tigerish, which came to him across the lawn and in the\ncharming air as a waft from the jungle. Yet it made him admire most of\nthe two, made him envy, the glossy male tiger, magnificently marked.\nThese absurdities of the stirred sense, fruits of suggestion ripening\non the instant, were all reflected in his next words to little Bilham.\n“I know—if we talk of that—whom _I_ should enjoy being like!”\n\nLittle Bilham followed his eyes; but then as with a shade of knowing\nsurprise: “Gloriani?”\n\nOur friend had in fact already hesitated, though not on the hint of his\ncompanion’s doubt, in which there were depths of critical reserve. He\nhad just made out, in the now full picture, something and somebody\nelse; another impression had been superimposed. A young girl in a white\ndress and a softly plumed white hat had suddenly come into view, and\nwhat was presently clear was that her course was toward them. What was\nclearer still was that the handsome young man at her side was Chad\nNewsome, and what was clearest of all was that she was therefore\nMademoiselle de Vionnet, that she was unmistakeably pretty—bright\ngentle shy happy wonderful—and that Chad now, with a consummate\ncalculation of effect, was about to present her to his old friend’s\nvision. What was clearest of all indeed was something much more than\nthis, something at the single stroke of which—and wasn’t it simply\njuxtaposition?—all vagueness vanished. It was the click of a spring—he\nsaw the truth. He had by this time also met Chad’s look; there was more\nof it in that; and the truth, accordingly, so far as Bilham’s enquiry\nwas concerned, had thrust in the answer. “Oh Chad!”—it was that rare\nyouth he should have enjoyed being “like.” The virtuous attachment\nwould be all there before him; the virtuous attachment would be in the\nvery act of appeal for his blessing; Jeanne de Vionnet, this charming\ncreature, would be exquisitely, intensely now—the object of it. Chad\nbrought her straight up to him, and Chad was, oh yes, at this\nmoment—for the glory of Woollett or whatever—better still even than\nGloriani. He had plucked this blossom; he had kept it over-night in\nwater; and at last as he held it up to wonder he did enjoy his effect.\nThat was why Strether had felt at first the breath of calculation—and\nwhy moreover, as he now knew, his look at the girl would be, for the\nyoung man, a sign of the latter’s success. What young man had ever\nparaded about that way, without a reason, a maiden in her flower? And\nthere was nothing in his reason at present obscure. Her type\nsufficiently told of it—they wouldn’t, they couldn’t, want her to go to\nWoollett. Poor Woollett, and what it might miss!—though brave Chad\nindeed too, and what it might gain! Brave Chad however had just\nexcellently spoken. “This is a good little friend of mine who knows all\nabout you and has moreover a message for you. And this, my dear”—he had\nturned to the child herself—“is the best man in the world, who has it\nin his power to do a great deal for us and whom I want you to like and\nrevere as nearly as possible as much as I do.”\n\nShe stood there quite pink, a little frightened, prettier and prettier\nand not a bit like her mother. There was in this last particular no\nresemblance but that of youth to youth; and here was in fact suddenly\nStrether’s sharpest impression. It went wondering, dazed, embarrassed,\nback to the woman he had just been talking with; it was a revelation in\nthe light of which he already saw she would become more interesting. So\nslim and fresh and fair, she had yet put forth this perfection; so that\nfor really believing it of her, for seeing her to any such developed\ndegree as a mother, comparison would be urgent. Well, what was it now\nbut fairly thrust upon him? “Mamma wishes me to tell you before we go,”\nthe girl said, “that she hopes very much you’ll come to see us very\nsoon. She has something important to say to you.”\n\n“She quite reproaches herself,” Chad helpfully explained: “you were\ninteresting her so much when she accidentally suffered you to be\ninterrupted.”\n\n“Ah don’t mention it!” Strether murmured, looking kindly from one to\nthe other and wondering at many things.\n\n“And I’m to ask you for myself,” Jeanne continued with her hands\nclasped together as if in some small learnt prayer—“I’m to ask you for\nmyself if you won’t positively come.”\n\n“Leave it to me, dear—I’ll take care of it!” Chad genially declared in\nanswer to this, while Strether himself almost held his breath. What was\nin the girl was indeed too soft, too unknown for direct dealing; so\nthat one could only gaze at it as at a picture, quite staying one’s own\nhand. But with Chad he was now on ground—Chad he could meet; so\npleasant a confidence in that and in everything did the young man\nfreely exhale. There was the whole of a story in his tone to his\ncompanion, and he spoke indeed as if already of the family. It made\nStrether guess the more quickly what it might be about which Madame de\nVionnet was so urgent. Having seen him then she had found him easy; she\nwished to have it out with him that some way for the young people must\nbe discovered, some way that would not impose as a condition the\ntransplantation of her daughter. He already saw himself discussing with\nthis lady the attractions of Woollett as a residence for Chad’s\ncompanion. Was that youth going now to trust her with the affair—so\nthat it would be after all with one of his “lady-friends” that his\nmother’s missionary should be condemned to deal? It was quite as if for\nan instant the two men looked at each other on this question. But there\nwas no mistaking at last Chad’s pride in the display of such a\nconnexion. This was what had made him so carry himself while, three\nminutes before, he was bringing it into view; what had caused his\nfriend, first catching sight of him, to be so struck with his air. It\nwas, in a word, just when he thus finally felt Chad putting things\nstraight off on him that he envied him, as he had mentioned to little\nBilham, most. The whole exhibition however was but a matter of three or\nfour minutes, and the author of it had soon explained that, as Madame\nde Vionnet was immediately going “on,” this could be for Jeanne but a\nsnatch. They would all meet again soon, and Strether was meanwhile to\nstay and amuse himself—“I’ll pick you up again in plenty of time.” He\ntook the girl off as he had brought her, and Strether, with the faint\nsweet foreignness of her “Au revoir, monsieur!” in his ears as a note\nalmost unprecedented, watched them recede side by side and felt how,\nonce more, her companion’s relation to her got an accent from it. They\ndisappeared among the others and apparently into the house; whereupon\nour friend turned round to give out to little Bilham the conviction of\nwhich he was full. But there was no little Bilham any more; little\nBilham had within the few moments, for reasons of his own, proceeded\nfurther: a circumstance by which, in its order, Strether was also\nsensibly affected.\n\n\n III\n\nChad was not in fact on this occasion to keep his promise of coming\nback; but Miss Gostrey had soon presented herself with an explanation\nof his failure. There had been reasons at the last for his going off\nwith _ces dames_; and he had asked her with much instance to come out\nand take charge of their friend. She did so, Strether felt as she took\nher place beside him, in a manner that left nothing to desire. He had\ndropped back on his bench, alone again for a time, and the more\nconscious for little Bilham’s defection of his unexpressed thought; in\nrespect to which however this next converser was a still more capacious\nvessel. “It’s the child!” he had exclaimed to her almost as soon as she\nappeared; and though her direct response was for some time delayed he\ncould feel in her meanwhile the working of this truth. It might have\nbeen simply, as she waited, that they were now in presence altogether\nof truth spreading like a flood and not for the moment to be offered\nher in the mere cupful; inasmuch as who should _ces dames_ prove to be\nbut persons about whom—once thus face to face with them—she found she\nmight from the first have told him almost everything? This would have\nfreely come had he taken the simple precaution of giving her their\nname. There could be no better example—and she appeared to note it with\nhigh amusement—than the way, making things out already so much for\nhimself, he was at last throwing precautions to the winds. They were\nneither more nor less, she and the child’s mother, than old\nschool-friends—friends who had scarcely met for years but whom this\nunlooked-for chance had brought together with a rush. It was a relief,\nMiss Gostrey hinted, to feel herself no longer groping; she was\nunaccustomed to grope and as a general thing, he might well have seen,\nmade straight enough for her clue. With the one she had now picked up\nin her hands there need be at least no waste of wonder. “She’s coming\nto see me—that’s for _you_,” Strether’s counsellor continued; “but I\ndon’t require it to know where I am.”\n\nThe waste of wonder might be proscribed; but Strether,\ncharacteristically, was even by this time in the immensity of space.\n“By which you mean that you know where _she_ is?”\n\nShe just hesitated. “I mean that if she comes to see me I shall—now\nthat I’ve pulled myself round a bit after the shock—not be at home.”\n\nStrether hung poised. “You call it—your recognition—a shock?”\n\nShe gave one of her rare flickers of impatience. “It was a surprise, an\nemotion. Don’t be so literal. I wash my hands of her.”\n\nPoor Strether’s face lengthened. “She’s impossible—?”\n\n“She’s even more charming than I remembered her.”\n\n“Then what’s the matter?”\n\nShe had to think how to put it. “Well, _I’m_ impossible. It’s\nimpossible. Everything’s impossible.”\n\nHe looked at her an instant. “I see where you’re coming out.\nEverything’s possible.” Their eyes had on it in fact an exchange of\nsome duration; after which he pursued: “Isn’t it that beautiful child?”\nThen as she still said nothing: “Why don’t you mean to receive her?”\n\nHer answer in an instant rang clear. “Because I wish to keep out of the\nbusiness.”\n\nIt provoked in him a weak wail. “You’re going to abandon me _now?_”\n\n“No, I’m only going to abandon _her_. She’ll want me to help her with\nyou. And I won’t.”\n\n“You’ll only help me with her? Well then—!” Most of the persons\npreviously gathered had, in the interest of tea, passed into the house,\nand they had the gardens mainly to themselves. The shadows were long,\nthe last call of the birds, who had made a home of their own in the\nnoble interspaced quarter, sounded from the high trees in the other\ngardens as well, those of the old convent and of the old _hôtels_; it\nwas as if our friends had waited for the full charm to come out.\nStrether’s impressions were still present; it was as if something had\nhappened that “nailed” them, made them more intense; but he was to ask\nhimself soon afterwards, that evening, what really _had_\nhappened—conscious as he could after all remain that for a gentleman\ntaken, and taken the first time, into the “great world,” the world of\nambassadors and duchesses, the items made a meagre total. It was\nnothing new to him, however, as we know, that a man might have—at all\nevents such a man as he—an amount of experience out of any proportion\nto his adventures; so that, though it was doubtless no great adventure\nto sit on there with Miss Gostrey and hear about Madame de Vionnet, the\nhour, the picture, the immediate, the recent, the possible—as well as\nthe communication itself, not a note of which failed to\nreverberate—only gave the moments more of the taste of history.\n\nIt was history, to begin with, that Jeanne’s mother had been\nthree-and-twenty years before, at Geneva, schoolmate and good\ngirlfriend to Maria Gostrey, who had moreover enjoyed since then,\nthough interruptedly and above all with a long recent drop, other\nglimpses of her. Twenty-three years put them both on, no doubt; and\nMadame de Vionnet—though she had married straight after school—couldn’t\nbe today an hour less than thirty-eight. This made her ten years older\nthan Chad—though ten years, also, if Strether liked, older than she\nlooked; the least, at any rate, that a prospective mother-in-law could\nbe expected to do with. She would be of all mothers-in-law the most\ncharming; unless indeed, through some perversity as yet insupposeable,\nshe should utterly belie herself in that relation. There was none\nsurely in which, as Maria remembered her, she mustn’t be charming; and\nthis frankly in spite of the stigma of failure in the tie where failure\nalways most showed. It was no test there—when indeed _was_ it a test\nthere?—for Monsieur de Vionnet had been a brute. She had lived for\nyears apart from him—which was of course always a horrid position; but\nMiss Gostrey’s impression of the matter had been that she could scarce\nhave made a better thing of it had she done it on purpose to show she\nwas amiable. She was so amiable that nobody had had a word to say;\nwhich was luckily not the case for her husband. He was so impossible\nthat she had the advantage of all her merits.\n\nIt was still history for Strether that the Comte de Vionnet—it being\nalso history that the lady in question was a Countess—should now, under\nMiss Gostrey’s sharp touch, rise before him as a high distinguished\npolished impertinent reprobate, the product of a mysterious order; it\nwas history, further, that the charming girl so freely sketched by his\ncompanion should have been married out of hand by a mother, another\nfigure of striking outline, full of dark personal motive; it was\nperhaps history most of all that this company was, as a matter of\ncourse, governed by such considerations as put divorce out of the\nquestion. “_Ces gens-là_ don’t divorce, you know, any more than they\nemigrate or abjure—they think it impious and vulgar”; a fact in the\nlight of which they seemed but the more richly special. It was all\nspecial; it was all, for Strether’s imagination, more or less rich. The\ngirl at the Genevese school, an isolated interesting attaching\ncreature, then both sensitive and violent, audacious but always\nforgiven, was the daughter of a French father and an English mother\nwho, early left a widow, had married again—tried afresh with a\nforeigner; in her career with whom she had apparently given her child\nno example of comfort. All these people—the people of the English\nmother’s side—had been of condition more or less eminent; yet with\noddities and disparities that had often since made Maria, thinking them\nover, wonder what they really quite rhymed to. It was in any case her\nbelief that the mother, interested and prone to adventure, had been\nwithout conscience, had only thought of ridding herself most quickly of\na possible, an actual encumbrance. The father, by her impression, a\nFrenchman with a name one knew, had been a different matter, leaving\nhis child, she clearly recalled, a memory all fondness, as well as an\nassured little fortune which was unluckily to make her more or less of\na prey later on. She had been in particular, at school, dazzlingly,\nthough quite booklessly, clever; as polyglot as a little Jewess (which\nshe wasn’t, oh no!) and chattering French, English, German, Italian,\nanything one would, in a way that made a clean sweep, if not of prizes\nand parchments, at least of every “part,” whether memorised or\nimprovised, in the curtained costumed school repertory, and in especial\nof all mysteries of race and vagueness of reference, all swagger about\n“home,” among their variegated mates.\n\nIt would doubtless be difficult to-day, as between French and English,\nto name her and place her; she would certainly show, on knowledge, Miss\nGostrey felt, as one of those convenient types who don’t keep you\nexplaining—minds with doors as numerous as the many-tongued cluster of\nconfessionals at Saint Peter’s. You might confess to her with\nconfidence in Roumelian, and even Roumelian sins. Therefore—! But\nStrether’s narrator covered her implication with a laugh; a laugh by\nwhich his betrayal of a sense of the lurid in the picture was also\nperhaps sufficiently protected. He had a moment of wondering, while his\nfriend went on, what sins might be especially Roumelian. She went on at\nall events to the mention of her having met the young thing—again by\nsome Swiss lake—in her first married state, which had appeared for the\nfew intermediate years not at least violently disturbed. She had been\nlovely at that moment, delightful to _her_, full of responsive emotion,\nof amused recognitions and amusing reminders, and then once more, much\nlater, after a long interval, equally but differently charming—touching\nand rather mystifying for the five minutes of an encounter at a\nrailway-station _en province_, during which it had come out that her\nlife was all changed. Miss Gostrey had understood enough to see,\nessentially, what had happened, and yet had beautifully dreamed that\nshe was herself faultless. There were doubtless depths in her, but she\nwas all right; Strether would see if she wasn’t. She was another person\nhowever—that had been promptly marked—from the small child of nature at\nthe Geneva school, a little person quite made over (as foreign women\n_were_, compared with American) by marriage. Her situation too had\nevidently cleared itself up; there would have been—all that was\npossible—a judicial separation. She had settled in Paris, brought up\nher daughter, steered her boat. It was no very pleasant boat—especially\nthere—to be in; but Marie de Vionnet would have headed straight. She\nwould have friends, certainly—and very good ones. There she was at all\nevents—and it was very interesting. Her knowing Mr. Chad didn’t in the\nleast prove she hadn’t friends; what it proved was what good ones _he_\nhad. “I saw that,” said Miss Gostrey, “that night at the Français; it\ncame out for me in three minutes. I saw _her_—or somebody like her. And\nso,” she immediately added, “did you.”\n\n“Oh no—not anybody like her!” Strether laughed. “But you mean,” he as\npromptly went on, “that she has had such an influence on him?”\n\nMiss Gostrey was on her feet; it was time for them to go. “She has\nbrought him up for her daughter.”\n\nTheir eyes, as so often, in candid conference, through their settled\nglasses, met over it long; after which Strether’s again took in the\nwhole place. They were quite alone there now. “Mustn’t she rather—in\nthe time then—have rushed it?”\n\n“Ah she won’t of course have lost an hour. But that’s just the good\nmother—the good French one. You must remember that of her—that as a\nmother she’s French, and that for them there’s a special providence. It\nprecisely however—that she mayn’t have been able to begin as far back\nas she’d have liked—makes her grateful for aid.”\n\nStrether took this in as they slowly moved to the house on their way\nout. “She counts on me then to put the thing through?”\n\n“Yes—she counts on you. Oh and first of all of course,” Miss Gostrey\nadded, “on her—well, convincing you.”\n\n“Ah,” her friend returned, “she caught Chad young!”\n\n“Yes, but there are women who are for all your ‘times of life.’ They’re\nthe most wonderful sort.”\n\nShe had laughed the words out, but they brought her companion, the next\nthing, to a stand. “Is what you mean that she’ll try to make a fool of\nme?”\n\n“Well, I’m wondering what she _will_—with an opportunity—make.”\n\n“What do you call,” Strether asked, “an opportunity? My going to see\nher?”\n\n“Ah you must go to see her”—Miss Gostrey was a trifle evasive. “You\ncan’t not do that. You’d have gone to see the other woman. I mean if\nthere had been one—a different sort. It’s what you came out for.”\n\nIt might be; but Strether distinguished. “I didn’t come out to see\n_this_ sort.”\n\nShe had a wonderful look at him now. “Are you disappointed she isn’t\nworse?”\n\nHe for a moment entertained the question, then found for it the\nfrankest of answers. “Yes. If she were worse she’d be better for our\npurpose. It would be simpler.”\n\n“Perhaps,” she admitted. “But won’t this be pleasanter?”\n\n“Ah you know,” he promptly replied, “I didn’t come out—wasn’t that just\nwhat you originally reproached me with?—for the pleasant.”\n\n“Precisely. Therefore I say again what I said at first. You must take\nthings as they come. Besides,” Miss Gostrey added, “I’m not afraid for\nmyself.”\n\n“For yourself—?”\n\n“Of your seeing her. I trust her. There’s nothing she’ll say about me.\nIn fact there’s nothing she _can_.”\n\nStrether wondered—little as he had thought of this. Then he broke out.\n“Oh you women!”\n\nThere was something in it at which she flushed. “Yes—there we are.\nWe’re abysses.” At last she smiled. “But I risk her!”\n\nHe gave himself a shake. “Well then so do I!” But he added as they\npassed into the house that he would see Chad the first thing in the\nmorning.\n\nThis was the next day the more easily effected that the young man, as\nit happened, even before he was down, turned up at his hotel. Strether\ntook his coffee, by habit, in the public room; but on his descending\nfor this purpose Chad instantly proposed an adjournment to what he\ncalled greater privacy. He had himself as yet had nothing—they would\nsit down somewhere together; and when after a few steps and a turn into\nthe Boulevard they had, for their greater privacy, sat down among\ntwenty others, our friend saw in his companion’s move a fear of the\nadvent of Waymarsh. It was the first time Chad had to that extent given\nthis personage “away”; and Strether found himself wondering of what it\nwas symptomatic. He made out in a moment that the youth was in earnest\nas he hadn’t yet seen him; which in its turn threw a ray perhaps a\ntrifle startling on what they had each up to that time been treating as\nearnestness. It was sufficiently flattering however that the real\nthing—if this _was_ at last the real thing—should have been determined,\nas appeared, precisely by an accretion of Strether’s importance. For\nthis was what it quickly enough came to—that Chad, rising with the\nlark, had rushed down to let him know while his morning consciousness\nwas yet young that he had literally made the afternoon before a\ntremendous impression. Madame de Vionnet wouldn’t, couldn’t rest till\nshe should have some assurance from him that he _would_ consent again\nto see her. The announcement was made, across their marble-topped\ntable, while the foam of the hot milk was in their cups and its plash\nstill in the air, with the smile of Chad’s easiest urbanity; and this\nexpression of his face caused our friend’s doubts to gather on the spot\ninto a challenge of the lips. “See here”—that was all; he only for the\nmoment said again “See here.” Chad met it with all his air of straight\nintelligence, while Strether remembered again that fancy of the first\nimpression of him, the happy young Pagan, handsome and hard but oddly\nindulgent, whose mysterious measure he had under the street-lamp tried\nmentally to take. The young Pagan, while a long look passed between\nthem, sufficiently understood. Strether scarce needed at last to say\nthe rest—“I want to know where I am.” But he said it, adding before any\nanswer something more. “Are you engaged to be married—is that your\nsecret?—to the young lady?”\n\nChad shook his head with the slow amenity that was one of his ways of\nconveying that there was time for everything. “I have no secret—though\nI may have secrets! I haven’t at any rate that one. We’re not engaged.\nNo.”\n\n“Then where’s the hitch?”\n\n“Do you mean why I haven’t already started with you?” Chad, beginning\nhis coffee and buttering his roll, was quite ready to explain. “Nothing\nwould have induced me—nothing will still induce me—not to try to keep\nyou here as long as you can be made to stay. It’s too visibly good for\nyou.” Strether had himself plenty to say about this, but it was amusing\nalso to measure the march of Chad’s tone. He had never been more a man\nof the world, and it was always in his company present to our friend\nthat one was seeing how in successive connexions a man of the world\nacquitted himself. Chad kept it up beautifully. “My idea—_voyons!_—is\nsimply that you should let Madame de Vionnet know you, simply that you\nshould consent to know _her_. I don’t in the least mind telling you\nthat, clever and charming as she is, she’s ever so much in my\nconfidence. All I ask of you is to let her talk to you. You’ve asked me\nabout what you call my hitch, and so far as it goes she’ll explain it\nto you. She’s herself my hitch, hang it—if you must really have it all\nout. But in a sense,” he hastened in the most wonderful manner to add,\n“that you’ll quite make out for yourself. She’s too good a friend,\nconfound her. Too good, I mean, for me to leave without—without—” It\nwas his first hesitation.\n\n“Without what?”\n\n“Well, without my arranging somehow or other the damnable terms of my\nsacrifice.”\n\n“It _will_ be a sacrifice then?”\n\n“It will be the greatest loss I ever suffered. I owe her so much.”\n\nIt was beautiful, the way Chad said these things, and his plea was now\nconfessedly—oh quite flagrantly and publicly—interesting. The moment\nreally took on for Strether an intensity. Chad owed Madame de Vionnet\nso much? What _did_ that do then but clear up the whole mystery? He was\nindebted for alterations, and she was thereby in a position to have\nsent in her bill for expenses incurred in reconstruction. What was this\nat bottom but what had been to be arrived at? Strether sat there\narriving at it while he munched toast and stirred his second cup. To do\nthis with the aid of Chad’s pleasant earnest face was also to do more\nbesides. No, never before had he been so ready to take him as he was.\nWhat was it that had suddenly so cleared up? It was just everybody’s\ncharacter; that is everybody’s but—in a measure—his own. Strether felt\n_his_ character receive for the instant a smutch from all the wrong\nthings he had suspected or believed. The person to whom Chad owed it\nthat he could positively turn out such a comfort to other persons—such\na person was sufficiently raised above any “breath” by the nature of\nher work and the young man’s steady light. All of which was vivid\nenough to come and go quickly; though indeed in the midst of it\nStrether could utter a question. “Have I your word of honour that if I\nsurrender myself to Madame de Vionnet you’ll surrender yourself to\n_me?_”\n\nChad laid his hand firmly on his friend’s. “My dear man, you have it.”\n\nThere was finally something in his felicity almost embarrassing and\noppressive—Strether had begun to fidget under it for the open air and\nthe erect posture. He had signed to the waiter that he wished to pay,\nand this transaction took some moments, during which he thoroughly\nfelt, while he put down money and pretended—it was quite hollow—to\nestimate change, that Chad’s higher spirit, his youth, his practice,\nhis paganism, his felicity, his assurance, his impudence, whatever it\nmight be, had consciously scored a success. Well, that was all right so\nfar as it went; his sense of the thing in question covered our friend\nfor a minute like a veil through which—as if he had been muffled—he\nheard his interlocutor ask him if he mightn’t take him over about five.\n“Over” was over the river, and over the river was where Madame de\nVionnet lived, and five was that very afternoon. They got at last out\nof the place—got out before he answered. He lighted, in the street, a\ncigarette, which again gave him more time. But it was already sharp for\nhim that there was no use in time. “What does she propose to do to me?”\nhe had presently demanded.\n\nChad had no delays. “Are you afraid of her?”\n\n“Oh immensely. Don’t you see it?”\n\n“Well,” said Chad, “she won’t do anything worse to you than make you\nlike her.”\n\n“It’s just of that I’m afraid.”\n\n“Then it’s not fair to me.”\n\nStrether cast about. “It’s fair to your mother.”\n\n“Oh,” said Chad, “are you afraid of _her?_”\n\n“Scarcely less. Or perhaps even more. But is this lady against your\ninterests at home?” Strether went on.\n\n“Not directly, no doubt; but she’s greatly in favour of them here.”\n\n“And what—‘here’—does she consider them to be?”\n\n“Well, good relations!”\n\n“With herself?”\n\n“With herself.”\n\n“And what is it that makes them so good?”\n\n“What? Well, that’s exactly what you’ll make out if you’ll only go, as\nI’m supplicating you, to see her.”\n\nStrether stared at him with a little of the wanness, no doubt, that the\nvision of more to “make out” could scarce help producing. “I mean _how_\ngood are they?”\n\n“Oh awfully good.”\n\nAgain Strether had faltered, but it was brief. It was all very well,\nbut there was nothing now he wouldn’t risk. “Excuse me, but I must\nreally—as I began by telling you—know where I am. Is she bad?”\n\n“‘Bad’?”—Chad echoed it, but without a shock. “Is that what’s\nimplied—?”\n\n“When relations are good?” Strether felt a little silly, and was even\nconscious of a foolish laugh, at having it imposed on him to have\nappeared to speak so. What indeed was he talking about? His stare had\nrelaxed; he looked now all round him. But something in him brought him\nback, though he still didn’t know quite how to turn it. The two or\nthree ways he thought of, and one of them in particular, were, even\nwith scruples dismissed, too ugly. He none the less at last found\nsomething. “Is her life without reproach?”\n\nIt struck him, directly he had found it, as pompous and priggish; so\nmuch so that he was thankful to Chad for taking it only in the right\nspirit. The young man spoke so immensely to the point that the effect\nwas practically of positive blandness. “Absolutely without reproach. A\nbeautiful life. _Allez donc voir!_”\n\nThese last words were, in the liberality of their confidence, so\nimperative that Strether went through no form of assent; but before\nthey separated it had been confirmed that he should be picked up at a\nquarter to five.\n\n\nBook Sixth\n\n\n I\n\nIt was quite by half-past five—after the two men had been together in\nMadame de Vionnet’s drawing-room not more than a dozen minutes—that\nChad, with a look at his watch and then another at their hostess, said\ngenially, gaily: “I’ve an engagement, and I know you won’t complain if\nI leave him with you. He’ll interest you immensely; and as for her,” he\ndeclared to Strether, “I assure you, if you’re at all nervous, she’s\nperfectly safe.”\n\nHe had left them to be embarrassed or not by this guarantee, as they\ncould best manage, and embarrassment was a thing that Strether wasn’t\nat first sure Madame de Vionnet escaped. He escaped it himself, to his\nsurprise; but he had grown used by this time to thinking of himself as\nbrazen. She occupied, his hostess, in the Rue de Bellechasse, the first\nfloor of an old house to which our visitors had had access from an old\nclean court. The court was large and open, full of revelations, for our\nfriend, of the habit of privacy, the peace of intervals, the dignity of\ndistances and approaches; the house, to his restless sense, was in the\nhigh homely style of an elder day, and the ancient Paris that he was\nalways looking for—sometimes intensely felt, sometimes more acutely\nmissed—was in the immemorial polish of the wide waxed staircase and in\nthe fine _boiseries_, the medallions, mouldings, mirrors, great clear\nspaces, of the greyish-white salon into which he had been shown. He\nseemed at the very outset to see her in the midst of possessions not\nvulgarly numerous, but hereditary cherished charming. While his eyes\nturned after a little from those of his hostess and Chad freely\ntalked—not in the least about _him_, but about other people, people he\ndidn’t know, and quite as if he did know them—he found himself making\nout, as a background of the occupant, some glory, some prosperity of\nthe First Empire, some Napoleonic glamour, some dim lustre of the great\nlegend; elements clinging still to all the consular chairs and\nmythological brasses and sphinxes’ heads and faded surfaces of satin\nstriped with alternate silk.\n\nThe place itself went further back—that he guessed, and how old Paris\ncontinued in a manner to echo there; but the post-revolutionary period,\nthe world he vaguely thought of as the world of Châteaubriand, of\nMadame de Staël, even of the young Lamartine, had left its stamp of\nharps and urns and torches, a stamp impressed on sundry small objects,\nornaments and relics. He had never before, to his knowledge, had\npresent to him relics, of any special dignity, of a private\norder—little old miniatures, medallions, pictures, books; books in\nleather bindings, pinkish and greenish, with gilt garlands on the back,\nranged, together with other promiscuous properties, under the glass of\nbrass-mounted cabinets. His attention took them all tenderly into\naccount. They were among the matters that marked Madame de Vionnet’s\napartment as something quite different from Miss Gostrey’s little\nmuseum of bargains and from Chad’s lovely home; he recognised it as\nfounded much more on old accumulations that had possibly from time to\ntime shrunken than on any contemporary method of acquisition or form of\ncuriosity. Chad and Miss Gostrey had rummaged and purchased and picked\nup and exchanged, sifting, selecting, comparing; whereas the mistress\nof the scene before him, beautifully passive under the spell of\ntransmission—transmission from her father’s line, he quite made up his\nmind—had only received, accepted and been quiet. When she hadn’t been\nquiet she had been moved at the most to some occult charity for some\nfallen fortune. There had been objects she or her predecessors might\neven conceivably have parted with under need, but Strether couldn’t\nsuspect them of having sold old pieces to get “better” ones. They would\nhave felt no difference as to better or worse. He could but imagine\ntheir having felt—perhaps in emigration, in proscription, for his\nsketch was slight and confused—the pressure of want or the obligation\nof sacrifice.\n\nThe pressure of want—whatever might be the case with the other\nforce—was, however, presumably not active now, for the tokens of a\nchastened ease still abounded after all, many marks of a taste whose\ndiscriminations might perhaps have been called eccentric. He guessed at\nintense little preferences and sharp little exclusions, a deep\nsuspicion of the vulgar and a personal view of the right. The general\nresult of this was something for which he had no name on the spot quite\nready, but something he would have come nearest to naming in speaking\nof it as the air of supreme respectability, the consciousness, small,\nstill, reserved, but none the less distinct and diffused, of private\nhonour. The air of supreme respectability—that was a strange blank wall\nfor his adventure to have brought him to break his nose against. It had\nin fact, as he was now aware, filled all the approaches, hovered in the\ncourt as he passed, hung on the staircase as he mounted, sounded in the\ngrave rumble of the old bell, as little electric as possible, of which\nChad, at the door, had pulled the ancient but neatly-kept tassel; it\nformed in short the clearest medium of its particular kind that he had\never breathed. He would have answered for it at the end of a quarter of\nan hour that some of the glass cases contained swords and epaulettes of\nancient colonels and generals; medals and orders once pinned over\nhearts that had long since ceased to beat; snuff-boxes bestowed on\nministers and envoys; copies of works presented, with inscriptions, by\nauthors now classic. At bottom of it all for him was the sense of her\nrare unlikeness to the women he had known. This sense had grown, since\nthe day before, the more he recalled her, and had been above all\nsingularly fed by his talk with Chad in the morning. Everything in fine\nmade her immeasurably new, and nothing so new as the old house and the\nold objects. There were books, two or three, on a small table near his\nchair, but they hadn’t the lemon-coloured covers with which his eye had\nbegun to dally from the hour of his arrival and to the opportunity of a\nfurther acquaintance with which he had for a fortnight now altogether\nsuccumbed. On another table, across the room, he made out the great\n_Revue_; but even that familiar face, conspicuous in Mrs. Newsome’s\nparlours, scarce counted here as a modern note. He was sure on the\nspot—and he afterwards knew he was right—that this was a touch of\nChad’s own hand. What would Mrs. Newsome say to the circumstance that\nChad’s interested “influence” kept her paper-knife in the _Revue_? The\ninterested influence at any rate had, as we say, gone straight to the\npoint—had in fact soon left it quite behind.\n\nShe was seated, near the fire, on a small stuffed and fringed chair one\nof the few modern articles in the room, and she leaned back in it with\nher hands clasped in her lap and no movement, in all her person, but\nthe fine prompt play of her deep young face. The fire, under the low\nwhite marble, undraped and academic, had burnt down to the silver ashes\nof light wood, one of the windows, at a distance, stood open to the\nmildness and stillness, out of which, in the short pauses, came the\nfaint sound, pleasant and homely, almost rustic, of a plash and a\nclatter of _sabots_ from some coach-house on the other side of the\ncourt. Madame de Vionnet, while Strether sat there, wasn’t to shift her\nposture by an inch. “I don’t think you seriously believe in what you’re\ndoing,” she said; “but all the same, you know, I’m going to treat you\nquite as if I did.”\n\n“By which you mean,” Strether directly replied, “quite as if you\ndidn’t! I assure you it won’t make the least difference with me how you\ntreat me.”\n\n“Well,” she said, taking that menace bravely and philosophically\nenough, “the only thing that really matters is that you shall get on\nwith me.”\n\n“Ah but I don’t!” he immediately returned.\n\nIt gave her another pause; which, however, she happily enough shook\noff. “Will you consent to go on with me a little—provisionally—as if\nyou did?”\n\nThen it was that he saw how she had decidedly come all the way; and\nthere accompanied it an extraordinary sense of her raising from\nsomewhere below him her beautiful suppliant eyes. He might have been\nperched at his door-step or at his window and she standing in the road.\nFor a moment he let her stand and couldn’t moreover have spoken. It had\nbeen sad, of a sudden, with a sadness that was like a cold breath in\nhis face. “What can I do,” he finally asked, “but listen to you as I\npromised Chadwick?”\n\n“Ah but what I’m asking you,” she quickly said, “isn’t what Mr. Newsome\nhad in mind.” She spoke at present, he saw, as if to take courageously\n_all_ her risk. “This is my own idea and a different thing.”\n\nIt gave poor Strether in truth—uneasy as it made him too—something of\nthe thrill of a bold perception justified. “Well,” he answered kindly\nenough, “I was sure a moment since that some idea of your own had come\nto you.”\n\nShe seemed still to look up at him, but now more serenely. “I made out\nyou were sure—and that helped it to come. So you see,” she continued,\n“we do get on.”\n\n“Oh but it appears to me I don’t at all meet your request. How can I\nwhen I don’t understand it?”\n\n“It isn’t at all necessary you should understand; it will do quite well\nenough if you simply remember it. Only feel I trust you—and for nothing\nso tremendous after all. Just,” she said with a wonderful smile, “for\ncommon civility.”\n\nStrether had a long pause while they sat again face to face, as they\nhad sat, scarce less conscious, before the poor lady had crossed the\nstream. She was the poor lady for Strether now because clearly she had\nsome trouble, and her appeal to him could only mean that her trouble\nwas deep. He couldn’t help it; it wasn’t his fault; he had done\nnothing; but by a turn of the hand she had somehow made their encounter\na relation. And the relation profited by a mass of things that were not\nstrictly in it or of it; by the very air in which they sat, by the high\ncold delicate room, by the world outside and the little plash in the\ncourt, by the First Empire and the relics in the stiff cabinets, by\nmatters as far off as those and by others as near as the unbroken clasp\nof her hands in her lap and the look her expression had of being most\nnatural when her eyes were most fixed. “You count upon me of course for\nsomething really much greater than it sounds.”\n\n“Oh it sounds great enough too!” she laughed at this.\n\nHe found himself in time on the point of telling her that she was, as\nMiss Barrace called it, wonderful; but, catching himself up, he said\nsomething else instead. “What was it Chad’s idea then that you should\nsay to me?”\n\n“Ah his idea was simply what a man’s idea always is—to put every effort\noff on the woman.”\n\n“The ‘woman’—?” Strether slowly echoed.\n\n“The woman he likes—and just in proportion as he likes her. In\nproportion too—for shifting the trouble—as she likes _him_.”\n\nStrether followed it; then with an abruptness of his own: “How much do\nyou like Chad?”\n\n“Just as much as _that_—to take all, with you, on myself.” But she got\nat once again away from this. “I’ve been trembling as if we were to\nstand or fall by what you may think of me; and I’m even now,” she went\non wonderfully, “drawing a long breath—and, yes, truly taking a great\ncourage—from the hope that I don’t in fact strike you as impossible.”\n\n“That’s at all events, clearly,” he observed after an instant, “the way\nI don’t strike _you_.”\n\n“Well,” she so far assented, “as you haven’t yet said you _won’t_ have\nthe little patience with me I ask for—”\n\n“You draw splendid conclusions? Perfectly. But I don’t understand\nthem,” Strether pursued. “You seem to me to ask for much more than you\nneed. What, at the worst for you, what at the best for myself, can I\nafter all do? I can use no pressure that I haven’t used. You come\nreally late with your request. I’ve already done all that for myself\nthe case admits of. I’ve said my say, and here I am.”\n\n“Yes, here you are, fortunately!” Madame de Vionnet laughed. “Mrs.\nNewsome,” she added in another tone, “didn’t think you can do so\nlittle.”\n\nHe had an hesitation, but he brought the words out. “Well, she thinks\nso now.”\n\n“Do you mean by that—?” But she also hung fire.\n\n“Do I mean what?”\n\nShe still rather faltered. “Pardon me if I touch on it, but if I’m\nsaying extraordinary things, why, perhaps, mayn’t I? Besides, doesn’t\nit properly concern us to know?”\n\n“To know what?” he insisted as after thus beating about the bush she\nhad again dropped.\n\nShe made the effort. “Has she given you up?”\n\nHe was amazed afterwards to think how simply and quietly he had met it.\n“Not yet.” It was almost as if he were a trifle disappointed—had\nexpected still more of her freedom. But he went straight on. “Is that\nwhat Chad has told you will happen to me?”\n\nShe was evidently charmed with the way he took it. “If you mean if\nwe’ve talked of it—most certainly. And the question’s not what has had\nleast to do with my wishing to see you.”\n\n“To judge if I’m the sort of man a woman _can_—?”\n\n“Precisely,” she exclaimed—“you wonderful gentleman! I do judge—I\n_have_ judged. A woman can’t. You’re safe—with every right to be. You’d\nbe much happier if you’d only believe it.”\n\nStrether was silent a little; then he found himself speaking with a\ncynicism of confidence of which even at the moment the sources were\nstrange to him. “I try to believe it. But it’s a marvel,” he exclaimed,\n“how _you_ already get at it!”\n\nOh she was able to say. “Remember how much I was on the way to it\nthrough Mr. Newsome—before I saw you. He thinks everything of your\nstrength.”\n\n“Well, I can bear almost anything!” our friend briskly interrupted.\nDeep and beautiful on this her smile came back, and with the effect of\nmaking him hear what he had said just as she had heard it. He easily\nenough felt that it gave him away, but what in truth had everything\ndone but that? It had been all very well to think at moments that he\nwas holding her nose down and that he had coerced her: what had he by\nthis time done but let her practically see that he accepted their\nrelation? What was their relation moreover—though light and brief\nenough in form as yet—but whatever she might choose to make it? Nothing\ncould prevent her—certainly he couldn’t—from making it pleasant. At the\nback of his head, behind everything, was the sense that she was—there,\nbefore him, close to him, in vivid imperative form—one of the rare\nwomen he had so often heard of, read of, thought of, but never met,\nwhose very presence, look, voice, the mere contemporaneous _fact_ of\nwhom, from the moment it was at all presented, made a relation of mere\nrecognition. That was not the kind of woman he had ever found Mrs.\nNewsome, a contemporaneous fact who had been distinctly slow to\nestablish herself; and at present, confronted with Madame de Vionnet,\nhe felt the simplicity of his original impression of Miss Gostrey. She\ncertainly had been a fact of rapid growth; but the world was wide, each\nday was more and more a new lesson. There were at any rate even among\nthe stranger ones relations and relations. “Of course I suit Chad’s\ngrand way,” he quickly added. “He hasn’t had much difficulty in working\nme in.”\n\nShe seemed to deny a little, on the young man’s behalf, by the rise of\nher eyebrows, an intention of any process at all inconsiderate. “You\nmust know how grieved he’d be if you were to lose anything. He believes\nyou can keep his mother patient.”\n\nStrether wondered with his eyes on her. “I see. _That’s_ then what you\nreally want of me. And how am I to do it? Perhaps you’ll tell me that.”\n\n“Simply tell her the truth.”\n\n“And what do you call the truth?”\n\n“Well, _any_ truth—about us all—that you see yourself. I leave it to\nyou.”\n\n“Thank you very much. I like,” Strether laughed with a slight\nharshness, “the way you leave things!”\n\nBut she insisted kindly, gently, as if it wasn’t so bad. “Be perfectly\nhonest. Tell her all.”\n\n“All?” he oddly echoed.\n\n“Tell her the simple truth,” Madame de Vionnet again pleaded.\n\n“But what _is_ the simple truth? The simple truth is exactly what I’m\ntrying to discover.”\n\nShe looked about a while, but presently she came back to him. “Tell\nher, fully and clearly, about _us_.”\n\nStrether meanwhile had been staring. “You and your daughter?”\n\n“Yes—little Jeanne and me. Tell her,” she just slightly quavered, “you\nlike us.”\n\n“And what good will that do me? Or rather”—he caught himself up—“what\ngood will it do _you?_”\n\nShe looked graver. “None, you believe, really?”\n\nStrether debated. “She didn’t send me out to ‘like’ you.”\n\n“Oh,” she charmingly contended, “she sent you out to face the facts.”\n\nHe admitted after an instant that there was something in that. “But how\ncan I face them till I know what they are? Do you want him,” he then\nbraced himself to ask, “to marry your daughter?”\n\nShe gave a headshake as noble as it was prompt. “No—not that.”\n\n“And he really doesn’t want to himself?”\n\nShe repeated the movement, but now with a strange light in her face.\n“He likes her too much.”\n\nStrether wondered. “To be willing to consider, you mean, the question\nof taking her to America?”\n\n“To be willing to do anything with her but be immensely kind and\nnice—really tender of her. We watch over her, and you must help us. You\nmust see her again.”\n\nStrether felt awkward. “Ah with pleasure—she’s so remarkably\nattractive.”\n\nThe mother’s eagerness with which Madame de Vionnet jumped at this was\nto come back to him later as beautiful in its grace. “The dear thing\n_did_ please you?” Then as he met it with the largest “Oh!” of\nenthusiasm: “She’s perfect. She’s my joy.”\n\n“Well, I’m sure that—if one were near her and saw more of her—she’d be\nmine.”\n\n“Then,” said Madame de Vionnet, “tell Mrs. Newsome that!”\n\nHe wondered the more. “What good will that do you?” As she appeared\nunable at once to say, however, he brought out something else. “Is your\ndaughter in love with our friend?”\n\n“Ah,” she rather startlingly answered, “I wish you’d find out!”\n\nHe showed his surprise. “I? A stranger?”\n\n“Oh you won’t be a stranger—presently. You shall see her quite, I\nassure you, as if you weren’t.”\n\nIt remained for him none the less an extraordinary notion. “It seems to\nme surely that if her mother can’t—”\n\n“Ah little girls and their mothers to-day!” she rather inconsequently\nbroke in. But she checked herself with something she seemed to give out\nas after all more to the point. “Tell her I’ve been good for him. Don’t\nyou think I have?”\n\nIt had its effect on him—more than at the moment he quite measured. Yet\nhe was consciously enough touched. “Oh if it’s all _you_—!”\n\n“Well, it may not be ‘all,’” she interrupted, “but it’s to a great\nextent. Really and truly,” she added in a tone that was to take its\nplace with him among things remembered.\n\n“Then it’s very wonderful.” He smiled at her from a face that he felt\nas strained, and her own face for a moment kept him so. At last she\nalso got up. “Well, don’t you think that for that—”\n\n“I ought to save you?” So it was that the way to meet her—and the way,\nas well, in a manner, to get off—came over him. He heard himself use\nthe exorbitant word, the very sound of which helped to determine his\nflight. “I’ll save you if I can.”\n\n\n II\n\nIn Chad’s lovely home, however, one evening ten days later, he felt\nhimself present at the collapse of the question of Jeanne de Vionnet’s\nshy secret. He had been dining there in the company of that young lady\nand her mother, as well as of other persons, and he had gone into the\n_petit salon_, at Chad’s request, on purpose to talk with her. The\nyoung man had put this to him as a favour—“I should like so awfully to\nknow what you think of her. It will really be a chance for you,” he had\nsaid, “to see the _jeune fille_—I mean the type—as she actually is, and\nI don’t think that, as an observer of manners, it’s a thing you ought\nto miss. It will be an impression that—whatever else you take—you can\ncarry home with you, where you’ll find again so much to compare it\nwith.”\n\nStrether knew well enough with what Chad wished him to compare it, and\nthough he entirely assented he hadn’t yet somehow been so deeply\nreminded that he was being, as he constantly though mutely expressed\nit, used. He was as far as ever from making out exactly to what end;\nbut he was none the less constantly accompanied by a sense of the\nservice he rendered. He conceived only that this service was highly\nagreeable to those who profited by it; and he was indeed still waiting\nfor the moment at which he should catch it in the act of proving\ndisagreeable, proving in some degree intolerable, to himself. He failed\nquite to see how his situation could clear up at all logically except\nby some turn of events that would give him the pretext of disgust. He\nwas building from day to day on the possibility of disgust, but each\nday brought forth meanwhile a new and more engaging bend of the road.\nThat possibility was now ever so much further from sight than on the\neve of his arrival, and he perfectly felt that, should it come at all,\nit would have to be at best inconsequent and violent. He struck himself\nas a little nearer to it only when he asked himself what service, in\nsuch a life of utility, he was after all rendering Mrs. Newsome. When\nhe wished to help himself to believe that he was still all right he\nreflected—and in fact with wonder—on the unimpaired frequency of their\ncorrespondence; in relation to which what was after all more natural\nthan that it should become more frequent just in proportion as their\nproblem became more complicated?\n\nCertain it is at any rate that he now often brought himself balm by the\nquestion, with the rich consciousness of yesterday’s letter, “Well,\nwhat can I do more than that—what can I do more than tell her\neverything?” To persuade himself that he did tell her, had told her,\neverything, he used to try to think of particular things he hadn’t told\nher. When at rare moments and in the watches of the night he pounced on\none it generally showed itself to be—to a deeper scrutiny—not quite\ntruly of the essence. When anything new struck him as coming up, or\nanything already noted as reappearing, he always immediately wrote, as\nif for fear that if he didn’t he would miss something; and also that he\nmight be able to say to himself from time to time “She knows it\n_now_—even while I worry.” It was a great comfort to him in general not\nto have left past things to be dragged to light and explained; not to\nhave to produce at so late a stage anything not produced, or anything\neven veiled and attenuated, at the moment. She knew it now: that was\nwhat he said to himself to-night in relation to the fresh fact of\nChad’s acquaintance with the two ladies—not to speak of the fresher one\nof his own. Mrs. Newsome knew in other words that very night at\nWoollett that he himself knew Madame de Vionnet and that he had\nconscientiously been to see her; also that he had found her remarkably\nattractive and that there would probably be a good deal more to tell.\nBut she further knew, or would know very soon, that, again\nconscientiously, he hadn’t repeated his visit; and that when Chad had\nasked him on the Countess’s behalf—Strether made her out vividly, with\na thought at the back of his head, a Countess—if he wouldn’t name a day\nfor dining with her, he had replied lucidly: “Thank you very\nmuch—impossible.” He had begged the young man would present his excuses\nand had trusted him to understand that it couldn’t really strike one as\nquite the straight thing. He hadn’t reported to Mrs. Newsome that he\nhad promised to “save” Madame de Vionnet; but, so far as he was\nconcerned with that reminiscence, he hadn’t at any rate promised to\nhaunt her house. What Chad had understood could only, in truth, be\ninferred from Chad’s behaviour, which had been in this connexion as\neasy as in every other. He was easy, always, when he understood; he was\neasier still, if possible, when he didn’t; he had replied that he would\nmake it all right; and he had proceeded to do this by substituting the\npresent occasion—as he was ready to substitute others—for any, for\nevery occasion as to which his old friend should have a funny scruple.\n\n“Oh but I’m not a little foreign girl; I’m just as English as I can\nbe,” Jeanne de Vionnet had said to him as soon as, in the _petit\nsalon_, he sank, shyly enough on his own side, into the place near her\nvacated by Madame Gloriani at his approach. Madame Gloriani, who was in\nblack velvet, with white lace and powdered hair, and whose somewhat\nmassive majesty melted, at any contact, into the graciousness of some\nincomprehensible tongue, moved away to make room for the vague\ngentleman, after benevolent greetings to him which embodied, as he\nbelieved, in baffling accents, some recognition of his face from a\ncouple of Sundays before. Then he had remarked—making the most of the\nadvantage of his years—that it frightened him quite enough to find\nhimself dedicated to the entertainment of a little foreign girl. There\nwere girls he wasn’t afraid of—he was quite bold with little Americans.\nThus it was that she had defended herself to the end—“Oh but I’m almost\nAmerican too. That’s what mamma has wanted me to be—I mean _like_ that;\nfor she has wanted me to have lots of freedom. She has known such good\nresults from it.”\n\nShe was fairly beautiful to him—a faint pastel in an oval frame: he\nthought of her already as of some lurking image in a long gallery, the\nportrait of a small old-time princess of whom nothing was known but\nthat she had died young. Little Jeanne wasn’t, doubtless, to die young,\nbut one couldn’t, all the same, bear on her lightly enough. It was\nbearing hard, it was bearing as _he_, in any case, wouldn’t bear, to\nconcern himself, in relation to her, with the question of a young man.\nOdious really the question of a young man; one didn’t treat such a\nperson as a maid-servant suspected of a “follower.” And then young men,\nyoung men—well, the thing was their business simply, or was at all\nevents hers. She was fluttered, fairly fevered—to the point of a little\nglitter that came and went in her eyes and a pair of pink spots that\nstayed in her cheeks—with the great adventure of dining out and with\nthe greater one still, possibly, of finding a gentleman whom she must\nthink of as very, very old, a gentleman with eye-glasses, wrinkles, a\nlong grizzled moustache. She spoke the prettiest English, our friend\nthought, that he had ever heard spoken, just as he had believed her a\nfew minutes before to be speaking the prettiest French. He wondered\nalmost wistfully if such a sweep of the lyre didn’t react on the spirit\nitself; and his fancy had in fact, before he knew it, begun so to stray\nand embroider that he finally found himself, absent and extravagant,\nsitting with the child in a friendly silence. Only by this time he felt\nher flutter to have fortunately dropped and that she was more at her\nease. She trusted him, liked him, and it was to come back to him\nafterwards that she had told him things. She had dipped into the\nwaiting medium at last and found neither surge nor chill—nothing but\nthe small splash she could herself make in the pleasant warmth, nothing\nbut the safety of dipping and dipping again. At the end of the ten\nminutes he was to spend with her his impression—with all it had thrown\noff and all it had taken in—was complete. She had been free, as she\nknew freedom, partly to show him that, unlike other little persons she\nknew, she had imbibed that ideal. She was delightfully quaint about\nherself, but the vision of what she had imbibed was what most held him.\nIt really consisted, he was soon enough to feel, in just one great\nlittle matter, the fact that, whatever her nature, she was\nthoroughly—he had to cast about for the word, but it came—bred. He\ncouldn’t of course on so short an acquaintance speak for her nature,\nbut the idea of breeding was what she had meanwhile dropped into his\nmind. He had never yet known it so sharply presented. Her mother gave\nit, no doubt; but her mother, to make that less sensible, gave so much\nelse besides, and on neither of the two previous occasions,\nextraordinary woman, Strether felt, anything like what she was giving\ntonight. Little Jeanne was a case, an exquisite case of education;\nwhereas the Countess, whom it so amused him to think of by that\ndenomination, was a case, also exquisite, of—well, he didn’t know what.\n\n“He has wonderful taste, _notre jeune homme_”: this was what Gloriani\nsaid to him on turning away from the inspection of a small picture\nsuspended near the door of the room. The high celebrity in question had\njust come in, apparently in search of Mademoiselle de Vionnet, but\nwhile Strether had got up from beside her their fellow guest, with his\neye sharply caught, had paused for a long look. The thing was a\nlandscape, of no size, but of the French school, as our friend was glad\nto feel he knew, and also of a quality—which he liked to think he\nshould also have guessed; its frame was large out of proportion to the\ncanvas, and he had never seen a person look at anything, he thought,\njust as Gloriani, with his nose very near and quick movements of the\nhead from side to side and bottom to top, examined this feature of\nChad’s collection. The artist used that word the next moment smiling\ncourteously, wiping his nippers and looking round him further—paying\nthe place in short by the very manner of his presence and by something\nStrether fancied he could make out in this particular glance, such a\ntribute as, to the latter’s sense, settled many things once for all.\nStrether was conscious at this instant, for that matter, as he hadn’t\nyet been, of how, round about him, quite without him, they _were_\nconsistently settled. Gloriani’s smile, deeply Italian, he considered,\nand finely inscrutable, had had for him, during dinner, at which they\nwere not neighbours, an indefinite greeting; but the quality in it was\ngone that had appeared on the other occasion to turn him inside out; it\nwas as if even the momentary link supplied by the doubt between them\nhad snapped. He was conscious now of the final reality, which was that\nthere wasn’t so much a doubt as a difference altogether; all the more\nthat over the difference the famous sculptor seemed to signal almost\ncondolingly, yet oh how vacantly! as across some great flat sheet of\nwater. He threw out the bridge of a charming hollow civility on which\nStrether wouldn’t have trusted his own full weight a moment. That idea,\neven though but transient and perhaps belated, had performed the office\nof putting Strether more at his ease, and the blurred picture had\nalready dropped—dropped with the sound of something else said and with\nhis becoming aware, by another quick turn, that Gloriani was now on the\nsofa talking with Jeanne, while he himself had in his ears again the\nfamiliar friendliness and the elusive meaning of the “Oh, oh, oh!” that\nhad made him, a fortnight before, challenge Miss Barrace in vain. She\nhad always the air, this picturesque and original lady, who struck him,\nso oddly, as both antique and modern—she had always the air of taking\nup some joke that one had already had out with her. The point itself,\nno doubt, was what was antique, and the use she made of it what was\nmodern. He felt just now that her good-natured irony did bear on\nsomething, and it troubled him a little that she wouldn’t be more\nexplicit only assuring him, with the pleasure of observation so visible\nin her, that she wouldn’t tell him more for the world. He could take\nrefuge but in asking her what she had done with Waymarsh, though it\nmust be added that he felt himself a little on the way to a clue after\nshe had answered that this personage was, in the other room, engaged in\nconversation with Madame de Vionnet. He stared a moment at the image of\nsuch a conjunction; then, for Miss Barrace’s benefit, he wondered. “Is\nshe too then under the charm—?”\n\n“No, not a bit”—Miss Barrace was prompt. “She makes nothing of him.\nShe’s bored. She won’t help you with him.”\n\n“Oh,” Strether laughed, “she can’t do everything.\n\n“Of course not—wonderful as she is. Besides, he makes nothing of _her_.\nShe won’t take him from me—though she wouldn’t, no doubt, having other\naffairs in hand, even if she could. I’ve never,” said Miss Barrace,\n“seen her fail with any one before. And to-night, when she’s so\nmagnificent, it would seem to her strange—if she minded. So at any rate\nI have him all. _Je suis tranquille!_”\n\nStrether understood, so far as that went; but he was feeling for his\nclue. “She strikes you to-night as particularly magnificent?”\n\n“Surely. Almost as I’ve never seen her. Doesn’t she you? Why it’s _for_\nyou.”\n\nHe persisted in his candour. “‘For’ me—?”\n\n“Oh, oh, oh!” cried Miss Barrace, who persisted in the opposite of that\nquality.\n\n“Well,” he acutely admitted, “she _is_ different. She’s gay.”\n\n“She’s gay!” Miss Barrace laughed. “And she has beautiful\nshoulders—though there’s nothing different in that.”\n\n“No,” said Strether, “one was sure of her shoulders. It isn’t her\nshoulders.”\n\nHis companion, with renewed mirth and the finest sense, between the\npuffs of her cigarette, of the drollery of things, appeared to find\ntheir conversation highly delightful. “Yes, it isn’t her shoulders.”\n\n“What then is it?” Strether earnestly enquired.\n\n“Why, it’s _she_—simply. It’s her mood. It’s her charm.”\n\n“Of course it’s her charm, but we’re speaking of the difference.”\n“Well,” Miss Barrace explained, “she’s just brilliant, as we used to\nsay. That’s all. She’s various. She’s fifty women.”\n\n“Ah but only one”—Strether kept it clear—“at a time.”\n\n“Perhaps. But in fifty times—!”\n\n“Oh we shan’t come to that,” our friend declared; and the next moment\nhe had moved in another direction. “Will you answer me a plain\nquestion? Will she ever divorce?”\n\nMiss Barrace looked at him through all her tortoise-shell. “Why should\nshe?”\n\nIt wasn’t what he had asked for, he signified; but he met it well\nenough. “To marry Chad.”\n\n“Why should she marry Chad?”\n\n“Because I’m convinced she’s very fond of him. She has done wonders for\nhim.”\n\n“Well then, how could she do more? Marrying a man, or woman either,”\nMiss Barrace sagely went on, “is never the wonder for any Jack and Jill\ncan bring _that_ off. The wonder is their doing such things without\nmarrying.”\n\nStrether considered a moment this proposition. “You mean it’s so\nbeautiful for our friends simply to go on so?”\n\nBut whatever he said made her laugh. “Beautiful.”\n\nHe nevertheless insisted. “And _that_ because it’s disinterested?”\n\nShe was now, however, suddenly tired of the question. “Yes then—call it\nthat. Besides, she’ll never divorce. Don’t, moreover,” she added,\n“believe everything you hear about her husband.”\n\n“He’s not then,” Strether asked, “a wretch?”\n\n“Oh yes. But charming.”\n\n“Do you know him?”\n\n“I’ve met him. He’s _bien aimable_.”\n\n“To every one but his wife?”\n\n“Oh for all I know, to her too—to any, to every woman. I hope you at\nany rate,” she pursued with a quick change, “appreciate the care I take\nof Mr. Waymarsh.”\n\n“Oh immensely.” But Strether was not yet in line. “At all events,” he\nroundly brought out, “the attachment’s an innocent one.”\n\n“Mine and his? Ah,” she laughed, “don’t rob it of _all_ interest!”\n\n“I mean our friend’s here—to the lady we’ve been speaking of.” That was\nwhat he had settled to as an indirect but none the less closely\ninvolved consequence of his impression of Jeanne. That was where he\nmeant to stay. “It’s innocent,” he repeated—“I see the whole thing.”\n\nMystified by his abrupt declaration, she had glanced over at Gloriani\nas at the unnamed subject of his allusion, but the next moment she had\nunderstood; though indeed not before Strether had noticed her momentary\nmistake and wondered what might possibly be behind that too. He already\nknew that the sculptor admired Madame de Vionnet; but did this\nadmiration also represent an attachment of which the innocence was\ndiscussable? He was moving verily in a strange air and on ground not of\nthe firmest. He looked hard for an instant at Miss Barrace, but she had\nalready gone on. “All right with Mr. Newsome? Why of course she\nis!”—and she got gaily back to the question of her own good friend. “I\ndare say you’re surprised that I’m not worn out with all I see—it being\nso much!—of Sitting Bull. But I’m not, you know—I don’t mind him; I\nbear up, and we get on beautifully. I’m very strange; I’m like that;\nand often I can’t explain. There are people who are supposed\ninteresting or remarkable or whatever, and who bore me to death; and\nthen there are others as to whom nobody can understand what anybody\nsees in them—in whom I see no end of things.” Then after she had smoked\na moment, “He’s touching, you know,” she said.\n\n“‘Know’?” Strether echoed—“don’t I, indeed? We must move you almost to\ntears.”\n\n“Oh but I don’t mean _you!_” she laughed.\n\n“You ought to then, for the worst sign of all—as I must have it for\nyou—is that you can’t help me. That’s when a woman pities.”\n\n“Ah but I do help you!” she cheerfully insisted.\n\nAgain he looked at her hard, and then after a pause: “No you don’t!”\n\nHer tortoise-shell, on its long chain, rattled down. “I help you with\nSitting Bull. That’s a good deal.”\n\n“Oh that, yes.” But Strether hesitated. “Do you mean he talks of me?”\n\n“So that I have to defend you? No, never.’\n\n“I see,” Strether mused. “It’s too deep.”\n\n“That’s his only fault,” she returned—“that everything, with him, is\ntoo deep. He has depths of silence—which he breaks only at the longest\nintervals by a remark. And when the remark comes it’s always something\nhe has seen or felt for himself—never a bit banal. _That_ would be what\none might have feared and what would kill me. But never.” She smoked\nagain as she thus, with amused complacency, appreciated her\nacquisition. “And never about you. We keep clear of you. We’re\nwonderful. But I’ll tell you what he does do,” she continued: “he tries\nto make me presents.”\n\n“Presents?” poor Strether echoed, conscious with a pang that _he_\nhadn’t yet tried that in any quarter.\n\n“Why you see,” she explained, “he’s as fine as ever in the victoria; so\nthat when I leave him, as I often do almost for hours—he likes it so—at\nthe doors of shops, the sight of him there helps me, when I come out,\nto know my carriage away off in the rank. But sometimes, for a change,\nhe goes with me into the shops, and then I’ve all I can do to prevent\nhis buying me things.”\n\n“He wants to ‘treat’ you?” Strether almost gasped at all he himself\nhadn’t thought of. He had a sense of admiration. “Oh he’s much more in\nthe real tradition than I. Yes,” he mused, “it’s the sacred rage.”\n\n“The sacred rage, exactly!”—and Miss Barrace, who hadn’t before heard\nthis term applied, recognised its bearing with a clap of her gemmed\nhands. “Now I do know why he’s not banal. But I do prevent him all the\nsame—and if you saw what he sometimes selects—from buying. I save him\nhundreds and hundreds. I only take flowers.”\n\n“Flowers?” Strether echoed again with a rueful reflexion. How many\nnosegays had her present converser sent?\n\n“Innocent flowers,” she pursued, “as much as he likes. And he sends me\nsplendours; he knows all the best places—he has found them for himself;\nhe’s wonderful.”\n\n“He hasn’t told them to _me_,” her friend smiled, “he has a life of his\nown.” But Strether had swung back to the consciousness that for himself\nafter all it never would have done. Waymarsh hadn’t Mrs. Waymarsh in\nthe least to consider, whereas Lambert Strether had constantly, in the\ninmost honour of his thoughts, to consider Mrs. Newsome. He liked\nmoreover to feel how much his friend was in the real tradition. Yet he\nhad his conclusion. “_What_ a rage it is!” He had worked it out. “It’s\nan opposition.”\n\nShe followed, but at a distance. “That’s what I feel. Yet to what?”\n\n“Well, he thinks, you know, that _I’ve_ a life of my own. And I\nhaven’t!”\n\n“You haven’t?” She showed doubt, and her laugh confirmed it. “Oh, oh,\noh!”\n\n“No—not for myself. I seem to have a life only for other people.”\n\n“Ah for them and _with_ them! Just now for instance with—”\n\n“Well, with whom?” he asked before she had had time to say.\n\nHis tone had the effect of making her hesitate and even, as he guessed,\nspeak with a difference. “Say with Miss Gostrey. What do you do for\n_her?_” It really made him wonder. “Nothing at all!”\n\n\n III\n\nMadame de Vionnet, having meanwhile come in, was at present close to\nthem, and Miss Barrace hereupon, instead of risking a rejoinder, became\nagain with a look that measured her from top to toe all mere\nlong-handled appreciative tortoise-shell. She had struck our friend,\nfrom the first of her appearing, as dressed for a great occasion, and\nshe met still more than on either of the others the conception\nreawakened in him at their garden-party, the idea of the _femme du\nmonde_ in her habit as she lived. Her bare shoulders and arms were\nwhite and beautiful; the materials of her dress, a mixture, as he\nsupposed, of silk and crape, were of a silvery grey so artfully\ncomposed as to give an impression of warm splendour; and round her neck\nshe wore a collar of large old emeralds, the green note of which was\nmore dimly repeated, at other points of her apparel, in embroidery, in\nenamel, in satin, in substances and textures vaguely rich. Her head,\nextremely fair and exquisitely festal, was like a happy fancy, a notion\nof the antique, on an old precious medal, some silver coin of the\nRenaissance; while her slim lightness and brightness, her gaiety, her\nexpression, her decision, contributed to an effect that might have been\nfelt by a poet as half mythological and half conventional. He could\nhave compared her to a goddess still partly engaged in a morning cloud,\nor to a sea-nymph waist-high in the summer surge. Above all she\nsuggested to him the reflexion that the _femme du monde_—in these\nfinest developments of the type—was, like Cleopatra in the play, indeed\nvarious and multifold. She had aspects, characters, days, nights—or had\nthem at least, showed them by a mysterious law of her own, when in\naddition to everything she happened also to be a woman of genius. She\nwas an obscure person, a muffled person one day, and a showy person, an\nuncovered person the next. He thought of Madame de Vionnet to-night as\nshowy and uncovered, though he felt the formula rough, because, thanks\nto one of the short-cuts of genius she had taken all his categories by\nsurprise. Twice during dinner he had met Chad’s eyes in a longish look;\nbut these communications had in truth only stirred up again old\nambiguities—so little was it clear from them whether they were an\nappeal or an admonition. “You see how I’m fixed,” was what they\nappeared to convey; yet how he was fixed was exactly what Strether\ndidn’t see. However, perhaps he should see now.\n\n“Are you capable of the very great kindness of going to relieve\nNewsome, for a few minutes, of the rather crushing responsibility of\nMadame Gloriani, while I say a word, if he’ll allow me, to Mr.\nStrether, of whom I’ve a question to ask? Our host ought to talk a bit\nto those other ladies, and I’ll come back in a minute to your rescue.”\nShe made this proposal to Miss Barrace as if her consciousness of a\nspecial duty had just flickered-up, but that lady’s recognition of\nStrether’s little start at it—as at a betrayal on the speaker’s part of\na domesticated state—was as mute as his own comment; and after an\ninstant, when their fellow guest had good-naturedly left them, he had\nbeen given something else to think of. “Why has Maria so suddenly gone?\nDo you know?” That was the question Madame de Vionnet had brought with\nher.\n\n“I’m afraid I’ve no reason to give you but the simple reason I’ve had\nfrom her in a note—the sudden obligation to join in the south a sick\nfriend who has got worse.”\n\n“Ah then she has been writing you?”\n\n“Not since she went—I had only a brief explanatory word before she\nstarted. I went to see her,” Strether explained—“it was the day after I\ncalled on you—but she was already on her way, and her concierge told me\nthat in case of my coming I was to be informed she had written to me. I\nfound her note when I got home.”\n\nMadame de Vionnet listened with interest and with her eyes on\nStrether’s face; then her delicately decorated head had a small\nmelancholy motion. “She didn’t write to _me_. I went to see her,” she\nadded, “almost immediately after I had seen you, and as I assured her I\nwould do when I met her at Gloriani’s. She hadn’t then told me she was\nto be absent, and I felt at her door as if I understood. She’s\nabsent—with all respect to her sick friend, though I know indeed she\nhas plenty—so that I may not see her. She doesn’t want to meet me\nagain. Well,” she continued with a beautiful conscious mildness, “I\nliked and admired her beyond every one in the old time, and she knew\nit—perhaps that’s precisely what has made her go—and I dare say I\nhaven’t lost her for ever.” Strether still said nothing; he had a\nhorror, as he now thought of himself, of being in question between\nwomen—was in fact already quite enough on his way to that, and there\nwas moreover, as it came to him, perceptibly, something behind these\nallusions and professions that, should he take it in, would square but\nill with his present resolve to simplify. It was as if, for him, all\nthe same, her softness and sadness were sincere. He felt that not less\nwhen she soon went on: “I’m extremely glad of her happiness.” But it\nalso left him mute—sharp and fine though the imputation it conveyed.\nWhat it conveyed was that _he_ was Maria Gostrey’s happiness, and for\nthe least little instant he had the impulse to challenge the thought.\nHe could have done so however only by saying “What then do you suppose\nto be between us?” and he was wonderfully glad a moment later not to\nhave spoken. He would rather seem stupid any day than fatuous, and he\ndrew back as well, with a smothered inward shudder, from the\nconsideration of what women—of highly-developed type in\nparticular—might think of each other. Whatever he had come out for he\nhadn’t come to go into that; so that he absolutely took up nothing his\ninterlocutress had now let drop. Yet, though he had kept away from her\nfor days, had laid wholly on herself the burden of their meeting again,\nshe hadn’t a gleam of irritation to show him. “Well, about Jeanne now?”\nshe smiled—it had the gaiety with which she had originally come in. He\nfelt it on the instant to represent her motive and real errand. But he\nhad been schooling her of a truth to say much in proportion to his\nlittle. “_Do_ you make out that she has a sentiment? I mean for Mr.\nNewsome.”\n\nAlmost resentful, Strether could at last be prompt. “How can I make out\nsuch things?”\n\nShe remained perfectly good-natured. “Ah but they’re beautiful little\nthings, and you make out—don’t pretend—everything in the world. Haven’t\nyou,” she asked, “been talking with her?”\n\n“Yes, but not about Chad. At least not much.”\n\n“Oh you don’t require ‘much’!” she reassuringly declared. But she\nimmediately changed her ground. “I hope you remember your promise of\nthe other day.”\n\n“To ‘save’ you, as you called it?”\n\n“I call it so still. You _will?_” she insisted. “You haven’t repented?”\n\nHe wondered. “No—but I’ve been thinking what I meant.”\n\nShe kept it up. “And not, a little, what _I_ did?”\n\n“No—that’s not necessary. It will be enough if I know what I meant\nmyself.”\n\n“And don’t you know,” she asked, “by this time?”\n\nAgain he had a pause. “I think you ought to leave it to me. But how\nlong,” he added, “do you give me?”\n\n“It seems to me much more a question of how long you give _me_. Doesn’t\nour friend here himself, at any rate,” she went on, “perpetually make\nme present to you?”\n\n“Not,” Strether replied, “by ever speaking of you to me.”\n\n“He never does that?”\n\n“Never.”\n\nShe considered, and, if the fact was disconcerting to her, effectually\nconcealed it. The next minute indeed she had recovered. “No, he\nwouldn’t. But do you _need_ that?”\n\nHer emphasis was wonderful, and though his eyes had been wandering he\nlooked at her longer now. “I see what you mean.”\n\n“Of course you see what I mean.”\n\nHer triumph was gentle, and she really had tones to make justice weep.\n“I’ve before me what he owes you.”\n\n“Admit then that that’s something,” she said, yet still with the same\ndiscretion in her pride.\n\nHe took in this note but went straight on. “You’ve made of him what I\nsee, but what I don’t see is how in the world you’ve done it.”\n\n“Ah that’s another question!” she smiled. “The point is of what use is\nyour declining to know me when to know Mr. Newsome—as you do me the\nhonour to find him—_is_ just to know me.”\n\n“I see,” he mused, still with his eyes on her. “I shouldn’t have met\nyou to-night.”\n\nShe raised and dropped her linked hands. “It doesn’t matter. If I trust\nyou why can’t you a little trust me too? And why can’t you also,” she\nasked in another tone, “trust yourself?” But she gave him no time to\nreply. “Oh I shall be so easy for you! And I’m glad at any rate you’ve\nseen my child.”\n\n“I’m glad too,” he said; “but she does you no good.”\n\n“No good?”—Madame de Vionnet had a clear stare. “Why she’s an angel of\nlight.”\n\n“That’s precisely the reason. Leave her alone. Don’t try to find out. I\nmean,” he explained, “about what you spoke to me of—the way she feels.”\n\nHis companion wondered. “Because one really won’t?”\n\n“Well, because I ask you, as a favour to myself, not to. She’s the most\ncharming creature I’ve ever seen. Therefore don’t touch her. Don’t\nknow—don’t want to know. And moreover—yes—you _won’t_.”\n\nIt was an appeal, of a sudden, and she took it in. “As a favour to\nyou?”\n\n“Well—since you ask me.”\n\n“Anything, everything you ask,” she smiled. “I shan’t know then—never.\nThank you,” she added with peculiar gentleness as she turned away.\n\nThe sound of it lingered with him, making him fairly feel as if he had\nbeen tripped up and had a fall. In the very act of arranging with her\nfor his independence he had, under pressure from a particular\nperception, inconsistently, quite stupidly, committed himself, and,\nwith her subtlety sensitive on the spot to an advantage, she had driven\nin by a single word a little golden nail, the sharp intention of which\nhe signally felt. He hadn’t detached, he had more closely connected\nhimself, and his eyes, as he considered with some intensity this\ncircumstance, met another pair which had just come within their range\nand which struck him as reflecting his sense of what he had done. He\nrecognised them at the same moment as those of little Bilham, who had\napparently drawn near on purpose to speak to him, and little Bilham\nwasn’t, in the conditions, the person to whom his heart would be most\nclosed. They were seated together a minute later at the angle of the\nroom obliquely opposite the corner in which Gloriani was still engaged\nwith Jeanne de Vionnet, to whom at first and in silence their attention\nhad been benevolently given. “I can’t see for my life,” Strether had\nthen observed, “how a young fellow of any spirit—such a one as you for\ninstance—can be admitted to the sight of that young lady without being\nhard hit. Why don’t you go in, little Bilham?” He remembered the tone\ninto which he had been betrayed on the garden-bench at the sculptor’s\nreception, and this might make up for that by being much more the right\nsort of thing to say to a young man worthy of any advice at all. “There\n_would_ be some reason.”\n\n“Some reason for what?”\n\n“Why for hanging on here.”\n\n“To offer my hand and fortune to Mademoiselle de Vionnet?”\n\n“Well,” Strether asked, “to what lovelier apparition _could_ you offer\nthem? She’s the sweetest little thing I’ve ever seen.”\n\n“She’s certainly immense. I mean she’s the real thing. I believe the\npale pink petals are folded up there for some wondrous efflorescence in\ntime; to open, that is, to some great golden sun. _I’m_ unfortunately\nbut a small farthing candle. What chance in such a field for a poor\nlittle painter-man?”\n\n“Oh you’re good enough,” Strether threw out.\n\n“Certainly I’m good enough. We’re good enough, I consider, _nous\nautres_, for anything. But she’s _too_ good. There’s the difference.\nThey wouldn’t look at me.”\n\nStrether, lounging on his divan and still charmed by the young girl,\nwhose eyes had consciously strayed to him, he fancied, with a vague\nsmile—Strether, enjoying the whole occasion as with dormant pulses at\nlast awake and in spite of new material thrust upon him, thought over\nhis companion’s words. “Whom do you mean by ‘they’? She and her\nmother?”\n\n“She and her mother. And she has a father too, who, whatever else he\nmay be, certainly can’t be indifferent to the possibilities she\nrepresents. Besides, there’s Chad.”\n\nStrether was silent a little. “Ah but he doesn’t care for her—not, I\nmean, it appears, after all, in the sense I’m speaking of. He’s _not_\nin love with her.”\n\n“No—but he’s her best friend; after her mother. He’s very fond of her.\nHe has his ideas about what can be done for her.”\n\n“Well, it’s very strange!” Strether presently remarked with a sighing\nsense of fulness.\n\n“Very strange indeed. That’s just the beauty of it. Isn’t it very much\nthe kind of beauty you had in mind,” little Bilham went on, “when you\nwere so wonderful and so inspiring to me the other day? Didn’t you\nadjure me, in accents I shall never forget, to see, while I’ve a\nchance, everything I can?—and _really_ to see, for it must have been\nthat only you meant. Well, you did me no end of good, and I’m doing my\nbest. I _do_ make it out a situation.”\n\n“So do I!” Strether went on after a moment. But he had the next minute\nan inconsequent question. “How comes Chad so mixed up, anyway?”\n\n“Ah, ah, ah!”—and little Bilham fell back on his cushions.\n\nIt reminded our friend of Miss Barrace, and he felt again the brush of\nhis sense of moving in a maze of mystic closed allusions. Yet he kept\nhold of his thread. “Of course I understand really; only the general\ntransformation makes me occasionally gasp. Chad with such a voice in\nthe settlement of the future of a little countess—no,” he declared, “it\ntakes more time! You say moreover,” he resumed, “that we’re inevitably,\npeople like you and me, out of the running. The curious fact remains\nthat Chad himself isn’t. The situation doesn’t make for it, but in a\ndifferent one he could have her if he would.”\n\n“Yes, but that’s only because he’s rich and because there’s a\npossibility of his being richer. They won’t think of anything but a\ngreat name or a great fortune.”\n\n“Well,” said Strether, “he’ll have no great fortune on _these_ lines.\nHe must stir his stumps.”\n\n“Is that,” little Bilham enquired, “what you were saying to Madame de\nVionnet?”\n\n“No—I don’t say much to her. Of course, however,” Strether continued,\n“he can make sacrifices if he likes.”\n\nLittle Bilham had a pause. “Oh he’s not keen for sacrifices; or thinks,\nthat is, possibly, that he has made enough.”\n\n“Well, it _is_ virtuous,” his companion observed with some decision.\n\n“That’s exactly,” the young man dropped after a moment, “what I mean.”\n\nIt kept Strether himself silent a little. “I’ve made it out for\nmyself,” he then went on; “I’ve really, within the last half-hour, got\nhold of it. I understand it in short at last; which at first—when you\noriginally spoke to me—I didn’t. Nor when Chad originally spoke to me\neither.”\n\n“Oh,” said little Bilham, “I don’t think that at that time you believed\nme.”\n\n“Yes—I did; and I believed Chad too. It would have been odious and\nunmannerly—as well as quite perverse—if I hadn’t. What interest have\nyou in deceiving me?”\n\nThe young man cast about. “What interest have I?”\n\n“Yes. Chad _might_ have. But you?”\n\n“Ah, ah, ah!” little Bilham exclaimed.\n\nIt might, on repetition, as a mystification, have irritated our friend\na little, but he knew, once more, as we have seen, where he was, and\nhis being proof against everything was only another attestation that he\nmeant to stay there. “I couldn’t, without my own impression, realise.\nShe’s a tremendously clever brilliant capable woman, and with an\nextraordinary charm on top of it all—the charm we surely all of us this\nevening know what to think of. It isn’t every clever brilliant capable\nwoman that has it. In fact it’s rare with any woman. So there you are,”\nStrether proceeded as if not for little Bilham’s benefit alone. “I\nunderstand what a relation with such a woman—what such a high fine\nfriendship—may be. It can’t be vulgar or coarse, anyway—and that’s the\npoint.”\n\n“Yes, that’s the point,” said little Bilham. “It can’t be vulgar or\ncoarse. And, bless us and save us, it _isn’t!_ It’s, upon my word, the\nvery finest thing I ever saw in my life, and the most distinguished.”\n\nStrether, from beside him and leaning back with him as he leaned,\ndropped on him a momentary look which filled a short interval and of\nwhich he took no notice. He only gazed before him with intent\nparticipation. “Of course what it has done for him,” Strether at all\nevents presently pursued, “of course what it has done for him—that is\nas to _how_ it has so wonderfully worked—isn’t a thing I pretend to\nunderstand. I’ve to take it as I find it. There he is.”\n\n“There he is!” little Bilham echoed. “And it’s really and truly she. I\ndon’t understand either, even with my longer and closer opportunity.\nBut I’m like you,” he added; “I can admire and rejoice even when I’m a\nlittle in the dark. You see I’ve watched it for some three years, and\nespecially for this last. He wasn’t so bad before it as I seem to have\nmade out that you think—”\n\n“Oh I don’t think anything now!” Strether impatiently broke in: “that\nis but what I _do_ think! I mean that originally, for her to have cared\nfor him—”\n\n“There must have been stuff in him? Oh yes, there was stuff indeed, and\nmuch more of it than ever showed, I dare say, at home. Still, you\nknow,” the young man in all fairness developed, “there was room for\nher, and that’s where she came in. She saw her chance and took it.\nThat’s what strikes me as having been so fine. But of course,” he wound\nup, “he liked her first.”\n\n“Naturally,” said Strether.\n\n“I mean that they first met somehow and somewhere—I believe in some\nAmerican house—and she, without in the least then intending it, made\nher impression. Then with time and opportunity he made his; and after\n_that_ she was as bad as he.”\n\nStrether vaguely took it up. “As ‘bad’?”\n\n“She began, that is, to care—to care very much. Alone, and in her\nhorrid position, she found it, when once she had started, an interest.\nIt was, it is, an interest, and it did—it continues to do—a lot for\nherself as well. So she still cares. She cares in fact,” said little\nBilham thoughtfully “more.”\n\nStrether’s theory that it was none of his business was somehow not\ndamaged by the way he took this. “More, you mean, than he?” On which\nhis companion looked round at him, and now for an instant their eyes\nmet. “More than he?” he repeated.\n\nLittle Bilham, for as long, hung fire. “Will you never tell any one?”\n\nStrether thought. “Whom should I tell?”\n\n“Why I supposed you reported regularly—”\n\n“To people at home?”—Strether took him up. “Well, I won’t tell them\nthis.”\n\nThe young man at last looked away. “Then she does now care more than\nhe.”\n\n“Oh!” Strether oddly exclaimed.\n\nBut his companion immediately met it. “Haven’t you after all had your\nimpression of it? That’s how you’ve got hold of him.”\n\n“Ah but I haven’t got hold of him!”\n\n“Oh I say!” But it was all little Bilham said.\n\n“It’s at any rate none of my business. I mean,” Strether explained,\n“nothing else than getting hold of him is.” It appeared, however, to\nstrike him as his business to add: “The fact remains nevertheless that\nshe has saved him.”\n\nLittle Bilham just waited. “I thought that was what _you_ were to do.”\n\nBut Strether had his answer ready. “I’m speaking—in connexion with\nher—of his manners and morals, his character and life. I’m speaking of\nhim as a person to deal with and talk with and live with—speaking of\nhim as a social animal.”\n\n“And isn’t it as a social animal that you also want him?”\n\n“Certainly; so that it’s as if she had saved him _for_ us.”\n\n“It strikes you accordingly then,” the young man threw out, “as for you\nall to save _her?_”\n\n“Oh for us ‘all’—!” Strether could but laugh at that. It brought him\nback, however, to the point he had really wished to make. “They’ve\naccepted their situation—hard as it is. They’re not free—at least she’s\nnot; but they take what’s left to them. It’s a friendship, of a\nbeautiful sort; and that’s what makes them so strong. They’re straight,\nthey feel; and they keep each other up. It’s doubtless she, however,\nwho, as you yourself have hinted, feels it most.”\n\nLittle Bilham appeared to wonder what he had hinted. “Feels most that\nthey’re straight?”\n\n“Well, feels that _she_ is, and the strength that comes from it. She\nkeeps _him_ up—she keeps the whole thing up. When people are able to\nit’s fine. She’s wonderful, wonderful, as Miss Barrace says; and he is,\nin his way, too; however, as a mere man, he may sometimes rebel and not\nfeel that he finds his account in it. She has simply given him an\nimmense moral lift, and what that can explain is prodigious. That’s why\nI speak of it as a situation. It _is_ one, if there ever was.” And\nStrether, with his head back and his eyes on the ceiling, seemed to\nlose himself in the vision of it.\n\nHis companion attended deeply. “You state it much better than I could.”\n“Oh you see it doesn’t concern you.”\n\nLittle Bilham considered. “I thought you said just now that it doesn’t\nconcern you either.”\n\n“Well, it doesn’t a bit as Madame de Vionnet’s affair. But as we were\nagain saying just now, what did I come out for but to save him?”\n\n“Yes—to remove him.”\n\n“To save him _by_ removal; to win him over to _himself_ thinking it\nbest he shall take up business—thinking he must immediately do\ntherefore what’s necessary to that end.”\n\n“Well,” said little Bilham after a moment, “you _have_ won him over. He\ndoes think it best. He has within a day or two again said to me as\nmuch.”\n\n“And that,” Strether asked, “is why you consider that he cares less\nthan she?”\n\n“Cares less for her than she for him? Yes, that’s one of the reasons.\nBut other things too have given me the impression. A man, don’t you\nthink?” little Bilham presently pursued, “_Can’t_, in such conditions,\ncare so much as a woman. It takes different conditions to make him, and\nthen perhaps he cares more. Chad,” he wound up, “has his possible\nfuture before him.”\n\n“Are you speaking of his business future?”\n\n“No—on the contrary; of the other, the future of what you so justly\ncall their situation. M. de Vionnet may live for ever.”\n\n“So that they can’t marry?”\n\nThe young man waited a moment. “Not being able to marry is all they’ve\nwith any confidence to look forward to. A woman—a particular woman—may\nstand that strain. But can a man?” he propounded.\n\nStrether’s answer was as prompt as if he had already, for himself,\nworked it out. “Not without a very high ideal of conduct. But that’s\njust what we’re attributing to Chad. And how, for that matter,” he\nmused, “does his going to America diminish the particular strain?\nWouldn’t it seem rather to add to it?”\n\n“Out of sight out of mind!” his companion laughed. Then more bravely:\n“Wouldn’t distance lessen the torment?” But before Strether could\nreply, “The thing is, you see, Chad ought to marry!” he wound up.\n\nStrether, for a little, appeared to think of it. “If you talk of\ntorments you don’t diminish mine!” he then broke out. The next moment\nhe was on his feet with a question. “He ought to marry whom?”\n\nLittle Bilham rose more slowly. “Well, some one he _can_—some\nthoroughly nice girl.”\n\nStrether’s eyes, as they stood together, turned again to Jeanne. “Do\nyou mean _her?_”\n\nHis friend made a sudden strange face. “After being in love with her\nmother? No.”\n\n“But isn’t it exactly your idea that he _isn’t_ in love with her\nmother?”\n\nHis friend once more had a pause. “Well, he isn’t at any rate in love\nwith Jeanne.”\n\n“I dare say not.”\n\n“How _can_ he be with any other woman?”\n\n“Oh that I admit. But being in love isn’t, you know, here”—little\nBilham spoke in friendly reminder—“thought necessary, in strictness,\nfor marriage.”\n\n“And what torment—to call a torment—can there ever possibly be with a\nwoman like that?” As if from the interest of his own question Strether\nhad gone on without hearing. “Is it for her to have turned a man out so\nwonderfully, too, only for somebody else?” He appeared to make a point\nof this, and little Bilham looked at him now. “When it’s for each other\nthat people give things up they don’t miss them.” Then he threw off as\nwith an extravagance of which he was conscious: “Let them face the\nfuture together!”\n\nLittle Bilham looked at him indeed. “You mean that after all he\nshouldn’t go back?”\n\n“I mean that if he gives her up—!”\n\n“Yes?”\n\n“Well, he ought to be ashamed of himself.” But Strether spoke with a\nsound that might have passed for a laugh.\n\n\n\n Volume II\n\n\nBook Seventh\n\n\n I\n\nIt wasn’t the first time Strether had sat alone in the great dim\nchurch—still less was it the first of his giving himself up, so far as\nconditions permitted, to its beneficent action on his nerves. He had\nbeen to Notre Dame with Waymarsh, he had been there with Miss Gostrey,\nhe had been there with Chad Newsome, and had found the place, even in\ncompany, such a refuge from the obsession of his problem that, with\nrenewed pressure from that source, he had not unnaturally recurred to a\nremedy meeting the case, for the moment, so indirectly, no doubt, but\nso relievingly. He was conscious enough that it was only for the\nmoment, but good moments—if he could call them good—still had their\nvalue for a man who by this time struck himself as living almost\ndisgracefully from hand to mouth. Having so well learnt the way, he had\nlately made the pilgrimage more than once by himself—had quite stolen\noff, taking an unnoticed chance and making no point of speaking of the\nadventure when restored to his friends.\n\nHis great friend, for that matter, was still absent, as well as\nremarkably silent; even at the end of three weeks Miss Gostrey hadn’t\ncome back. She wrote to him from Mentone, admitting that he must judge\nher grossly inconsequent—perhaps in fact for the time odiously\nfaithless; but asking for patience, for a deferred sentence, throwing\nherself in short on his generosity. For her too, she could assure him,\nlife was complicated—more complicated than he could have guessed; she\nhad moreover made certain of him—certain of not wholly missing him on\nher return—before her disappearance. If furthermore she didn’t burden\nhim with letters it was frankly because of her sense of the other great\ncommerce he had to carry on. He himself, at the end of a fortnight, had\nwritten twice, to show how his generosity could be trusted; but he\nreminded himself in each case of Mrs. Newsome’s epistolary manner at\nthe times when Mrs. Newsome kept off delicate ground. He sank his\nproblem, he talked of Waymarsh and Miss Barrace, of little Bilham and\nthe set over the river, with whom he had again had tea, and he was\neasy, for convenience, about Chad and Madame de Vionnet and Jeanne. He\nadmitted that he continued to see them, he was decidedly so confirmed a\nhaunter of Chad’s premises and that young man’s practical intimacy with\nthem was so undeniably great; but he had his reason for not attempting\nto render for Miss Gostrey’s benefit the impression of these last days.\nThat would be to tell her too much about himself—it being at present\njust from himself he was trying to escape.\n\nThis small struggle sprang not a little, in its way, from the same\nimpulse that had now carried him across to Notre Dame; the impulse to\nlet things be, to give them time to justify themselves or at least to\npass. He was aware of having no errand in such a place but the desire\nnot to be, for the hour, in certain other places; a sense of safety, of\nsimplification, which each time he yielded to it he amused himself by\nthinking of as a private concession to cowardice. The great church had\nno altar for his worship, no direct voice for his soul; but it was none\nthe less soothing even to sanctity; for he could feel while there what\nhe couldn’t elsewhere, that he was a plain tired man taking the holiday\nhe had earned. He was tired, but he wasn’t plain—that was the pity and\nthe trouble of it; he was able, however, to drop his problem at the\ndoor very much as if it had been the copper piece that he deposited, on\nthe threshold, in the receptacle of the inveterate blind beggar. He\ntrod the long dim nave, sat in the splendid choir, paused before the\ncluttered chapels of the east end, and the mighty monument laid upon\nhim its spell. He might have been a student under the charm of a\nmuseum—which was exactly what, in a foreign town, in the afternoon of\nlife, he would have liked to be free to be. This form of sacrifice did\nat any rate for the occasion as well as another; it made him quite\nsufficiently understand how, within the precinct, for the real refugee,\nthe things of the world could fall into abeyance. That was the\ncowardice, probably—to dodge them, to beg the question, not to deal\nwith it in the hard outer light; but his own oblivions were too brief,\ntoo vain, to hurt any one but himself, and he had a vague and fanciful\nkindness for certain persons whom he met, figures of mystery and\nanxiety, and whom, with observation for his pastime, he ranked as those\nwho were fleeing from justice. Justice was outside, in the hard light,\nand injustice too; but one was as absent as the other from the air of\nthe long aisles and the brightness of the many altars.\n\nThus it was at all events that, one morning some dozen days after the\ndinner in the Boulevard Malesherbes at which Madame de Vionnet had been\npresent with her daughter, he was called upon to play his part in an\nencounter that deeply stirred his imagination. He had the habit, in\nthese contemplations, of watching a fellow visitant, here and there,\nfrom a respectable distance, remarking some note of behaviour, of\npenitence, of prostration, of the absolved, relieved state; this was\nthe manner in which his vague tenderness took its course, the degree of\ndemonstration to which it naturally had to confine itself. It hadn’t\nindeed so felt its responsibility as when on this occasion he suddenly\nmeasured the suggestive effect of a lady whose supreme stillness, in\nthe shade of one of the chapels, he had two or three times noticed as\nhe made, and made once more, his slow circuit. She wasn’t prostrate—not\nin any degree bowed, but she was strangely fixed, and her prolonged\nimmobility showed her, while he passed and paused, as wholly given up\nto the need, whatever it was, that had brought her there. She only sat\nand gazed before her, as he himself often sat; but she had placed\nherself, as he never did, within the focus of the shrine, and she had\nlost herself, he could easily see, as he would only have liked to do.\nShe was not a wandering alien, keeping back more than she gave, but one\nof the familiar, the intimate, the fortunate, for whom these dealings\nhad a method and a meaning. She reminded our friend—since it was the\nway of nine tenths of his current impressions to act as recalls of\nthings imagined—of some fine firm concentrated heroine of an old story,\nsomething he had heard, read, something that, had he had a hand for\ndrama, he might himself have written, renewing her courage, renewing\nher clearness, in splendidly-protected meditation. Her back, as she\nsat, was turned to him, but his impression absolutely required that she\nshould be young and interesting, and she carried her head moreover,\neven in the sacred shade, with a discernible faith in herself, a kind\nof implied conviction of consistency, security, impunity. But what had\nsuch a woman come for if she hadn’t come to pray? Strether’s reading of\nsuch matters was, it must be owned, confused; but he wondered if her\nattitude were some congruous fruit of absolution, of “indulgence.” He\nknew but dimly what indulgence, in such a place, might mean; yet he\nhad, as with a soft sweep, a vision of how it might indeed add to the\nzest of active rites. All this was a good deal to have been denoted by\na mere lurking figure who was nothing to him; but, the last thing\nbefore leaving the church, he had the surprise of a still deeper\nquickening.\n\nHe had dropped upon a seat halfway down the nave and, again in the\nmuseum mood, was trying with head thrown back and eyes aloft, to\nreconstitute a past, to reduce it in fact to the convenient terms of\nVictor Hugo, whom, a few days before, giving the rein for once in a way\nto the joy of life, he had purchased in seventy bound volumes, a\nmiracle of cheapness, parted with, he was assured by the shopman, at\nthe price of the red-and-gold alone. He looked, doubtless, while he\nplayed his eternal nippers over Gothic glooms, sufficiently rapt in\nreverence; but what his thought had finally bumped against was the\nquestion of where, among packed accumulations, so multiform a wedge\nwould be able to enter. Were seventy volumes in red-and-gold to be\nperhaps what he should most substantially have to show at Woollett as\nthe fruit of his mission? It was a possibility that held him a\nminute—held him till he happened to feel that some one, unnoticed, had\napproached him and paused. Turning, he saw that a lady stood there as\nfor a greeting, and he sprang up as he next took her, securely, for\nMadame de Vionnet, who appeared to have recognised him as she passed\nnear him on her way to the door. She checked, quickly and gaily, a\ncertain confusion in him, came to meet it, turned it back, by an art of\nher own; the confusion having threatened him as he knew her for the\nperson he had lately been observing. She was the lurking figure of the\ndim chapel; she had occupied him more than she guessed; but it came to\nhim in time, luckily, that he needn’t tell her and that no harm, after\nall, had been done. She herself, for that matter, straightway showing\nshe felt their encounter as the happiest of accidents, had for him a\n“You come here too?” that despoiled surprise of every awkwardness.\n\n“I come often,” she said. “I love this place, but I’m terrible, in\ngeneral, for churches. The old women who live in them all know me; in\nfact I’m already myself one of the old women. It’s like that, at all\nevents, that I foresee I shall end.” Looking about for a chair, so that\nhe instantly pulled one nearer, she sat down with him again to the\nsound of an “Oh, I like so much your also being fond—!”\n\nHe confessed the extent of his feeling, though she left the object\nvague; and he was struck with the tact, the taste of her vagueness,\nwhich simply took for granted in him a sense of beautiful things. He\nwas conscious of how much it was affected, this sense, by something\nsubdued and discreet in the way she had arranged herself for her\nspecial object and her morning walk—he believed her to have come on\nfoot; the way her slightly thicker veil was drawn—a mere touch, but\neverything; the composed gravity of her dress, in which, here and\nthere, a dull wine-colour seemed to gleam faintly through black; the\ncharming discretion of her small compact head; the quiet note, as she\nsat, of her folded, grey-gloved hands. It was, to Strether’s mind, as\nif she sat on her own ground, the light honours of which, at an open\ngate, she thus easily did him, while all the vastness and mystery of\nthe domain stretched off behind. When people were so completely in\npossession they could be extraordinarily civil; and our friend had\nindeed at this hour a kind of revelation of her heritage. She was\nromantic for him far beyond what she could have guessed, and again he\nfound his small comfort in the conviction that, subtle though she was,\nhis impression must remain a secret from her. The thing that, once\nmore, made him uneasy for secrets in general was this particular\npatience she could have with his own want of colour; albeit that on the\nother hand his uneasiness pretty well dropped after he had been for ten\nminutes as colourless as possible and at the same time as responsive.\n\nThe moments had already, for that matter, drawn their deepest tinge\nfrom the special interest excited in him by his vision of his\ncompanion’s identity with the person whose attitude before the\nglimmering altar had so impressed him. This attitude fitted admirably\ninto the stand he had privately taken about her connexion with Chad on\nthe last occasion of his seeing them together. It helped him to stick\nfast at the point he had then reached; it was there he had resolved\nthat he _would_ stick, and at no moment since had it seemed as easy to\ndo so. Unassailably innocent was a relation that could make one of the\nparties to it so carry herself. If it wasn’t innocent why did she haunt\nthe churches?—into which, given the woman he could believe he made out,\nshe would never have come to flaunt an insolence of guilt. She haunted\nthem for continued help, for strength, for peace—sublime support which,\nif one were able to look at it so, she found from day to day. They\ntalked, in low easy tones and with lifted lingering looks, about the\ngreat monument and its history and its beauty—all of which, Madame de\nVionnet professed, came to her most in the other, the outer view.\n“We’ll presently, after we go,” she said, “walk round it again if you\nlike. I’m not in a particular hurry, and it will be pleasant to look at\nit well with you.” He had spoken of the great romancer and the great\nromance, and of what, to his imagination, they had done for the whole,\nmentioning to her moreover the exorbitance of his purchase, the seventy\nblazing volumes that were so out of proportion.\n\n“Out of proportion to what?”\n\n“Well, to any other plunge.” Yet he felt even as he spoke how at that\ninstant he was plunging. He had made up his mind and was impatient to\nget into the air; for his purpose was a purpose to be uttered outside,\nand he had a fear that it might with delay still slip away from him.\nShe however took her time; she drew out their quiet gossip as if she\nhad wished to profit by their meeting, and this confirmed precisely an\ninterpretation of her manner, of her mystery. While she rose, as he\nwould have called it, to the question of Victor Hugo, her voice itself,\nthe light low quaver of her deference to the solemnity about them,\nseemed to make her words mean something that they didn’t mean openly.\nHelp, strength, peace, a sublime support—she hadn’t found so much of\nthese things as that the amount wouldn’t be sensibly greater for any\nscrap his appearance of faith in her might enable her to feel in her\nhand. Every little, in a long strain, helped, and if he happened to\naffect her as a firm object she could hold on by, he wouldn’t jerk\nhimself out of her reach. People in difficulties held on by what was\nnearest, and he was perhaps after all not further off than sources of\ncomfort more abstract. It was as to this he had made up his mind; he\nhad made it up, that is, to give her a sign. The sign would be\nthat—though it was her own affair—he understood; the sign would be\nthat—though it was her own affair—she was free to clutch. Since she\ntook him for a firm object—much as he might to his own sense appear at\ntimes to rock—he would do his best to _be_ one.\n\nThe end of it was that half an hour later they were seated together for\nan early luncheon at a wonderful, a delightful house of entertainment\non the left bank—a place of pilgrimage for the knowing, they were both\naware, the knowing who came, for its great renown, the homage of\nrestless days, from the other end of the town. Strether had already\nbeen there three times—first with Miss Gostrey, then with Chad, then\nwith Chad again and with Waymarsh and little Bilham, all of whom he had\nhimself sagaciously entertained; and his pleasure was deep now on\nlearning that Madame de Vionnet hadn’t yet been initiated. When he had\nsaid as they strolled round the church, by the river, acting at last on\nwhat, within, he had made up his mind to, “Will you, if you have time,\ncome to déjeuner with me somewhere? For instance, if you know it, over\nthere on the other side, which is so easy a walk”—and then had named\nthe place; when he had done this she stopped short as for quick\nintensity, and yet deep difficulty, of response. She took in the\nproposal as if it were almost too charming to be true; and there had\nperhaps never yet been for her companion so unexpected a moment of\npride—so fine, so odd a case, at any rate, as his finding himself thus\nable to offer to a person in such universal possession a new, a rare\namusement. She had heard of the happy spot, but she asked him in reply\nto a further question how in the world he could suppose her to have\nbeen there. He supposed himself to have supposed that Chad might have\ntaken her, and she guessed this the next moment to his no small\ndiscomfort.\n\n“Ah, let me explain,” she smiled, “that I don’t go about with him in\npublic; I never have such chances—not having them otherwise—and it’s\njust the sort of thing that, as a quiet creature living in my hole, I\nadore.” It was more than kind of him to have thought of it—though,\nfrankly, if he asked whether she had time she hadn’t a single minute.\nThat however made no difference—she’d throw everything over. Every duty\nat home, domestic, maternal, social, awaited her; but it was a case for\na high line. Her affairs would go to smash, but hadn’t one a right to\none’s snatch of scandal when one was prepared to pay? It was on this\npleasant basis of costly disorder, consequently, that they eventually\nseated themselves, on either side of a small table, at a window\nadjusted to the busy quay and the shining barge-burdened Seine; where,\nfor an hour, in the matter of letting himself go, of diving deep,\nStrether was to feel he had touched bottom. He was to feel many things\non this occasion, and one of the first of them was that he had\ntravelled far since that evening in London, before the theatre, when\nhis dinner with Maria Gostrey, between the pink-shaded candles, had\nstruck him as requiring so many explanations. He had at that time\ngathered them in, the explanations—he had stored them up; but it was at\npresent as if he had either soared above or sunk below them—he couldn’t\ntell which; he could somehow think of none that didn’t seem to leave\nthe appearance of collapse and cynicism easier for him than lucidity.\nHow could he wish it to be lucid for others, for any one, that he, for\nthe hour, saw reasons enough in the mere way the bright clean ordered\nwater-side life came in at the open window?—the mere way Madame de\nVionnet, opposite him over their intensely white table-linen, their\n_omelette aux tomates_, their bottle of straw-coloured Chablis, thanked\nhim for everything almost with the smile of a child, while her grey\neyes moved in and out of their talk, back to the quarter of the warm\nspring air, in which early summer had already begun to throb, and then\nback again to his face and their human questions.\n\nTheir human questions became many before they had done—many more, as\none after the other came up, than our friend’s free fancy had at all\nforeseen. The sense he had had before, the sense he had had repeatedly,\nthe sense that the situation was running away with him, had never been\nso sharp as now; and all the more that he could perfectly put his\nfinger on the moment it had taken the bit in its teeth. That accident\nhad definitely occurred, the other evening, after Chad’s dinner; it had\noccurred, as he fully knew, at the moment when he interposed between\nthis lady and her child, when he suffered himself so to discuss with\nher a matter closely concerning them that her own subtlety, marked by\nits significant “Thank you!” instantly sealed the occasion in her\nfavour. Again he had held off for ten days, but the situation had\ncontinued out of hand in spite of that; the fact that it was running so\nfast being indeed just _why_ he had held off. What had come over him as\nhe recognised her in the nave of the church was that holding off could\nbe but a losing game from the instant she was worked for not only by\nher subtlety, but by the hand of fate itself. If all the accidents were\nto fight on her side—and by the actual showing they loomed large—he\ncould only give himself up. This was what he had done in privately\ndeciding then and there to propose she should breakfast with him. What\ndid the success of his proposal in fact resemble but the smash in which\na regular runaway properly ends? The smash was their walk, their\ndéjeuner, their omelette, the Chablis, the place, the view, their\npresent talk and his present pleasure in it—to say nothing, wonder of\nwonders, of her own. To this tune and nothing less, accordingly, was\nhis surrender made good. It sufficiently lighted up at least the folly\nof holding off. Ancient proverbs sounded, for his memory, in the tone\nof their words and the clink of their glasses, in the hum of the town\nand the plash of the river. It _was_ clearly better to suffer as a\nsheep than as a lamb. One might as well perish by the sword as by\nfamine.\n\n“Maria’s still away?”—that was the first thing she had asked him; and\nwhen he had found the frankness to be cheerful about it in spite of the\nmeaning he knew her to attach to Miss Gostrey’s absence, she had gone\non to enquire if he didn’t tremendously miss her. There were reasons\nthat made him by no means sure, yet he nevertheless answered\n“Tremendously”; which she took in as if it were all she had wished to\nprove. Then, “A man in trouble _must_ be possessed somehow of a woman,”\nshe said; “if she doesn’t come in one way she comes in another.”\n\n“Why do you call me a man in trouble?”\n\n“Ah because that’s the way you strike me.” She spoke ever so gently and\nas if with all fear of wounding him while she sat partaking of his\nbounty. “_Aren’t_ you in trouble?”\n\nHe felt himself colour at the question, and then hated that—hated to\npass for anything so idiotic as woundable. Woundable by Chad’s lady, in\nrespect to whom he had come out with such a fund of indifference—was he\nalready at that point? Perversely, none the less, his pause gave a\nstrange air of truth to her supposition; and what was he in fact but\ndisconcerted at having struck her just in the way he had most dreamed\nof not doing? “I’m not in trouble yet,” he at last smiled. “I’m not in\ntrouble now.”\n\n“Well, I’m always so. But that you sufficiently know.” She was a woman\nwho, between courses, could be graceful with her elbows on the table.\nIt was a posture unknown to Mrs. Newsome, but it was easy for a _femme\ndu monde_. “Yes—I am ‘now’!”\n\n“There was a question you put to me,” he presently returned, “the night\nof Chad’s dinner. I didn’t answer it then, and it has been very\nhandsome of you not to have sought an occasion for pressing me about it\nsince.”\n\nShe was instantly all there. “Of course I know what you allude to. I\nasked you what you had meant by saying, the day you came to see me,\njust before you left me, that you’d save me. And you then said—at our\nfriend’s—that you’d have really to wait to see, for yourself, what you\ndid mean.”\n\n“Yes, I asked for time,” said Strether. “And it sounds now, as you put\nit, like a very ridiculous speech.”\n\n“Oh!” she murmured—she was full of attenuation. But she had another\nthought. “If it does sound ridiculous why do you deny that you’re in\ntrouble?”\n\n“Ah if I were,” he replied, “it wouldn’t be the trouble of fearing\nridicule. I don’t fear it.”\n\n“What then do you?”\n\n“Nothing—now.” And he leaned back in his chair.\n\n“I like your ‘now’!” she laughed across at him.\n\n“Well, it’s precisely that it fully comes to me at present that I’ve\nkept you long enough. I know by this time, at any rate, what I meant by\nmy speech; and I really knew it the night of Chad’s dinner.”\n\n“Then why didn’t you tell me?”\n\n“Because it was difficult at the moment. I had already at that moment\ndone something for you, in the sense of what I had said the day I went\nto see you; but I wasn’t then sure of the importance I might represent\nthis as having.”\n\nShe was all eagerness. “And you’re sure now?”\n\n“Yes; I see that, practically, I’ve done for you—had done for you when\nyou put me your question—all that it’s as yet possible to me to do. I\nfeel now,” he went on, “that it may go further than I thought. What I\ndid after my visit to you,” he explained, “was to write straight off to\nMrs. Newsome about you, and I’m at last, from one day to the other,\nexpecting her answer. It’s this answer that will represent, as I\nbelieve, the consequences.”\n\nPatient and beautiful was her interest. “I see—the consequences of your\nspeaking for me.” And she waited as if not to hustle him.\n\nHe acknowledged it by immediately going on. “The question, you\nunderstand, was _how_ I should save you. Well, I’m trying it by thus\nletting her know that I consider you worth saving.”\n\n“I see—I see.” Her eagerness broke through.\n\n“How can I thank you enough?” He couldn’t tell her that, however, and\nshe quickly pursued. “You do really, for yourself, consider it?”\n\nHis only answer at first was to help her to the dish that had been\nfreshly put before them. “I’ve written to her again since then—I’ve\nleft her in no doubt of what I think. I’ve told her all about you.”\n\n“Thanks—not so much. ‘All about’ me,” she went on—“yes.”\n\n“All it seems to me you’ve done for him.”\n\n“Ah and you might have added all it seems to _me!_” She laughed again,\nwhile she took up her knife and fork, as in the cheer of these\nassurances. “But you’re not sure how she’ll take it.”\n\n“No, I’ll not pretend I’m sure.”\n\n“Voilà.” And she waited a moment. “I wish you’d tell me about her.”\n\n“Oh,” said Strether with a slightly strained smile, “all that need\nconcern you about her is that she’s really a grand person.”\n\nMadame de Vionnet seemed to demur. “Is that all that need concern me\nabout her?”\n\nBut Strether neglected the question. “Hasn’t Chad talked to you?”\n\n“Of his mother? Yes, a great deal—immensely. But not from your point of\nview.”\n\n“He can’t,” our friend returned, “have said any ill of her.”\n\n“Not the least bit. He has given me, like you, the assurance that she’s\nreally grand. But her being really grand is somehow just what hasn’t\nseemed to simplify our case. Nothing,” she continued, “is further from\nme than to wish to say a word against her; but of course I feel how\nlittle she can like being told of her owing me anything. No woman ever\nenjoys such an obligation to another woman.”\n\nThis was a proposition Strether couldn’t contradict. “And yet what\nother way could I have expressed to her what I felt? It’s what there\nwas most to say about you.”\n\n“Do you mean then that she _will_ be good to me?”\n\n“It’s what I’m waiting to see. But I’ve little doubt she would,” he\nadded, “if she could comfortably see you.”\n\nIt seemed to strike her as a happy, a beneficent thought. “Oh then\ncouldn’t that be managed? Wouldn’t she come out? Wouldn’t she if you so\nput it to her? _Did_ you by any possibility?” she faintly quavered.\n\n“Oh no”—he was prompt. “Not that. It would be, much more, to give an\naccount of you that—since there’s no question of _your_ paying the\nvisit—I should go home first.”\n\nIt instantly made her graver. “And are you thinking of that?”\n\n“Oh all the while, naturally.”\n\n“Stay with us—stay with us!” she exclaimed on this. “That’s your only\nway to make sure.”\n\n“To make sure of what?”\n\n“Why that he doesn’t break up. You didn’t come out to do that to him.”\n\n“Doesn’t it depend,” Strether returned after a moment, “on what you\nmean by breaking up?”\n\n“Oh you know well enough what I mean!”\n\nHis silence seemed again for a little to denote an understanding. “You\ntake for granted remarkable things.”\n\n“Yes, I do—to the extent that I don’t take for granted vulgar ones.\nYou’re perfectly capable of seeing that what you came out for wasn’t\nreally at all to do what you’d now have to do.”\n\n“Ah it’s perfectly simple,” Strether good-humouredly pleaded. “I’ve had\nbut one thing to do—to put our case before him. To put it as it could\nonly be put here on the spot—by personal pressure. My dear lady,” he\nlucidly pursued, “my work, you see, is really done, and my reasons for\nstaying on even another day are none of the best. Chad’s in possession\nof our case and professes to do it full justice. What remains is with\nhimself. I’ve had my rest, my amusement and refreshment; I’ve had, as\nwe say at Woollett, a lovely time. Nothing in it has been more lovely\nthan this happy meeting with you—in these fantastic conditions to which\nyou’ve so delightfully consented. I’ve a sense of success. It’s what I\nwanted. My getting all this good is what Chad has waited for, and I\ngather that if I’m ready to go he’s the same.”\n\nShe shook her head with a finer deeper wisdom. “You’re not ready. If\nyou’re ready why did you write to Mrs. Newsome in the sense you’ve\nmentioned to me?”\n\nStrether considered. “I shan’t go before I hear from her. You’re too\nmuch afraid of her,” he added.\n\nIt produced between them a long look from which neither shrank. “I\ndon’t think you believe that—believe I’ve not really reason to fear\nher.”\n\n“She’s capable of great generosity,” Strether presently stated.\n\n“Well then let her trust me a little. That’s all I ask. Let her\nrecognise in spite of everything what I’ve done.”\n\n“Ah remember,” our friend replied, “that she can’t effectually\nrecognise it without seeing it for herself. Let Chad go over and show\nher what you’ve done, and let him plead with her there for it and, as\nit were, for _you_.”\n\nShe measured the depth of this suggestion. “Do you give me your word of\nhonour that if she once has him there she won’t do her best to marry\nhim?”\n\nIt made her companion, this enquiry, look again a while out at the\nview; after which he spoke without sharpness. “When she sees for\nherself what he is—”\n\nBut she had already broken in. “It’s when she sees for herself what he\nis that she’ll want to marry him most.”\n\nStrether’s attitude, that of due deference to what she said, permitted\nhim to attend for a minute to his luncheon. “I doubt if that will come\noff. It won’t be easy to make it.”\n\n“It will be easy if he remains there—and he’ll remain for the money.\nThe money appears to be, as a probability, so hideously much.”\n\n“Well,” Strether presently concluded, “nothing _could_ really hurt you\nbut his marrying.”\n\nShe gave a strange light laugh. “Putting aside what may really hurt\n_him_.”\n\nBut her friend looked at her as if he had thought of that too. “The\nquestion will come up, of course, of the future that you yourself offer\nhim.”\n\nShe was leaning back now, but she fully faced him. “Well, let it come\nup!”\n\n“The point is that it’s for Chad to make of it what he can. His being\nproof against marriage will show what he does make.”\n\n“If he _is_ proof, yes”—she accepted the proposition. “But for myself,”\nshe added, “the question is what _you_ make.”\n\n“Ah I make nothing. It’s not my affair.”\n\n“I beg your pardon. It’s just there that, since you’ve taken it up and\nare committed to it, it most intensely becomes yours. You’re not saving\nme, I take it, for your interest in myself, but for your interest in\nour friend. The one’s at any rate wholly dependent on the other. You\ncan’t in honour not see me through,” she wound up, “because you can’t\nin honour not see _him_.”\n\nStrange and beautiful to him was her quiet soft acuteness. The thing\nthat most moved him was really that she was so deeply serious. She had\nnone of the portentous forms of it, but he had never come in contact,\nit struck him, with a force brought to so fine a head. Mrs. Newsome,\ngoodness knew, was serious; but it was nothing to this. He took it all\nin, he saw it all together. “No,” he mused, “I can’t in honour not see\nhim.”\n\nHer face affected him as with an exquisite light. “You _will_ then?”\n\n“I will.”\n\nAt this she pushed back her chair and was the next moment on her feet.\n“Thank you!” she said with her hand held out to him across the table\nand with no less a meaning in the words than her lips had so\nparticularly given them after Chad’s dinner. The golden nail she had\nthen driven in pierced a good inch deeper. Yet he reflected that he\nhimself had only meanwhile done what he had made up his mind to on the\nsame occasion. So far as the essence of the matter went he had simply\nstood fast on the spot on which he had then planted his feet.\n\n\n II\n\nHe received three days after this a communication from America, in the\nform of a scrap of blue paper folded and gummed, not reaching him\nthrough his bankers, but delivered at his hotel by a small boy in\nuniform, who, under instructions from the concierge, approached him as\nhe slowly paced the little court. It was the evening hour, but daylight\nwas long now and Paris more than ever penetrating. The scent of flowers\nwas in the streets, he had the whiff of violets perpetually in his\nnose; and he had attached himself to sounds and suggestions, vibrations\nof the air, human and dramatic, he imagined, as they were not in other\nplaces, that came out for him more and more as the mild afternoons\ndeepened—a far-off hum, a sharp near click on the asphalt, a voice\ncalling, replying, somewhere and as full of tone as an actor’s in a\nplay. He was to dine at home, as usual, with Waymarsh—they had settled\nto that for thrift and simplicity; and he now hung about before his\nfriend came down.\n\nHe read his telegram in the court, standing still a long time where he\nhad opened it and giving five minutes afterwards to the renewed study\nof it. At last, quickly, he crumpled it up as if to get it out of the\nway; in spite of which, however, he kept it there—still kept it when,\nat the end of another turn, he had dropped into a chair placed near a\nsmall table. Here, with his scrap of paper compressed in his fist and\nfurther concealed by his folding his arms tight, he sat for some time\nin thought, gazed before him so straight that Waymarsh appeared and\napproached him without catching his eye. The latter in fact, struck\nwith his appearance, looked at him hard for a single instant and then,\nas if determined to that course by some special vividness in it,\ndropped back into the _salon de lecture_ without addressing him. But\nthe pilgrim from Milrose permitted himself still to observe the scene\nfrom behind the clear glass plate of that retreat. Strether ended, as\nhe sat, by a fresh scrutiny of his compressed missive, which he\nsmoothed out carefully again as he placed it on his table. There it\nremained for some minutes, until, at last looking up, he saw Waymarsh\nwatching him from within. It was on this that their eyes met—met for a\nmoment during which neither moved. But Strether then got up, folding\nhis telegram more carefully and putting it into his waistcoat pocket.\n\nA few minutes later the friends were seated together at dinner; but\nStrether had meanwhile said nothing about it, and they eventually\nparted, after coffee in the court, with nothing said on either side.\nOur friend had moreover the consciousness that even less than usual was\non this occasion said between them, so that it was almost as if each\nhad been waiting for something from the other. Waymarsh had always more\nor less the air of sitting at the door of his tent, and silence, after\nso many weeks, had come to play its part in their concert. This note\nindeed, to Strether’s sense, had lately taken a fuller tone, and it was\nhis fancy to-night that they had never quite so drawn it out. Yet it\nbefell, none the less that he closed the door to confidence when his\ncompanion finally asked him if there were anything particular the\nmatter with him. “Nothing,” he replied, “more than usual.”\n\nOn the morrow, however, at an early hour, he found occasion to give an\nanswer more in consonance with the facts. What was the matter had\ncontinued to be so all the previous evening, the first hours of which,\nafter dinner, in his room, he had devoted to the copious composition of\na letter. He had quitted Waymarsh for this purpose, leaving him to his\nown resources with less ceremony than their wont, but finally coming\ndown again with his letter unconcluded and going forth into the streets\nwithout enquiry for his comrade. He had taken a long vague walk, and\none o’clock had struck before his return and his re-ascent to his room\nby the aid of the glimmering candle-end left for him on the shelf\noutside the porter’s lodge. He had possessed himself, on closing his\ndoor, of the numerous loose sheets of his unfinished composition, and\nthen, without reading them over, had torn them into small pieces. He\nhad thereupon slept—as if it had been in some measure thanks to that\nsacrifice—the sleep of the just, and had prolonged his rest\nconsiderably beyond his custom. Thus it was that when, between nine and\nten, the tap of the knob of a walking-stick sounded on his door, he had\nnot yet made himself altogether presentable. Chad Newsome’s bright deep\nvoice determined quickly enough none the less the admission of the\nvisitor. The little blue paper of the evening before, plainly an object\nthe more precious for its escape from premature destruction, now lay on\nthe sill of the open window, smoothed out afresh and kept from blowing\naway by the superincumbent weight of his watch. Chad, looking about\nwith careless and competent criticism, as he looked wherever he went\nimmediately espied it and permitted himself to fix it for a moment\nrather hard. After which he turned his eyes to his host. “It has come\nthen at last?”\n\nStrether paused in the act of pinning his necktie. “Then you know—?\nYou’ve had one too?”\n\n“No, I’ve had nothing, and I only know what I see. I see that thing and\nI guess. Well,” he added, “it comes as pat as in a play, for I’ve\nprecisely turned up this morning—as I would have done yesterday, but it\nwas impossible—to take you.”\n\n“To take me?” Strether had turned again to his glass.\n\n“Back, at last, as I promised. I’m ready—I’ve really been ready this\nmonth. I’ve only been waiting for you—as was perfectly right. But\nyou’re better now; you’re safe—I see that for myself; you’ve got all\nyour good. You’re looking, this morning, as fit as a flea.”\n\nStrether, at his glass, finished dressing; consulting that witness\nmoreover on this last opinion. _Was_ he looking preternaturally fit?\nThere was something in it perhaps for Chad’s wonderful eye, but he had\nfelt himself for hours rather in pieces. Such a judgement, however, was\nafter all but a contribution to his resolve; it testified unwittingly\nto his wisdom. He was still firmer, apparently—since it shone in him as\na light—than he had flattered himself. His firmness indeed was slightly\ncompromised, as he faced about to his friend, by the way this very\npersonage looked—though the case would of course have been worse hadn’t\nthe secret of personal magnificence been at every hour Chad’s unfailing\npossession. There he was in all the pleasant morning freshness of\nit—strong and sleek and gay, easy and fragrant and fathomless, with\nhappy health in his colour, and pleasant silver in his thick young\nhair, and the right word for everything on the lips that his clear\nbrownness caused to show as red. He had never struck Strether as\npersonally such a success; it was as if now, for his definite\nsurrender, he had gathered himself vividly together. This, sharply and\nrather strangely, was the form in which he was to be presented to\nWoollett. Our friend took him in again—he was always taking him in and\nyet finding that parts of him still remained out; though even thus his\nimage showed through a mist of other things. “I’ve had a cable,”\nStrether said, “from your mother.”\n\n“I dare say, my dear man. I hope she’s well.”\n\nStrether hesitated. “No—she’s not well, I’m sorry to have to tell you.”\n\n“Ah,” said Chad, “I must have had the instinct of it. All the more\nreason then that we should start straight off.”\n\nStrether had now got together hat, gloves and stick, but Chad had\ndropped on the sofa as if to show where he wished to make his point. He\nkept observing his companion’s things; he might have been judging how\nquickly they could be packed. He might even have wished to hint that\nhe’d send his own servant to assist. “What do you mean,” Strether\nenquired, “by ‘straight off’?”\n\n“Oh by one of next week’s boats. Everything at this season goes out so\nlight that berths will be easy anywhere.”\n\nStrether had in his hand his telegram, which he had kept there after\nattaching his watch, and he now offered it to Chad, who, however, with\nan odd movement, declined to take it. “Thanks, I’d rather not. Your\ncorrespondence with Mother’s your own affair. I’m only _with_ you both\non it, whatever it is.” Strether, at this, while their eyes met, slowly\nfolded the missive and put it in his pocket; after which, before he had\nspoken again, Chad broke fresh ground. “Has Miss Gostrey come back?”\n\nBut when Strether presently spoke it wasn’t in answer. “It’s not, I\ngather, that your mother’s physically ill; her health, on the whole,\nthis spring, seems to have been better than usual. But she’s worried,\nshe’s anxious, and it appears to have risen within the last few days to\na climax. We’ve tired out, between us, her patience.”\n\n“Oh it isn’t _you!_” Chad generously protested.\n\n“I beg your pardon—it _is_ me.” Strether was mild and melancholy, but\nfirm. He saw it far away and over his companion’s head. “It’s very\nparticularly me.”\n\n“Well then all the more reason. _Marchons, marchons!_” said the young\nman gaily. His host, however, at this, but continued to stand agaze;\nand he had the next thing repeated his question of a moment before.\n“Has Miss Gostrey come back?”\n\n“Yes, two days ago.”\n\n“Then you’ve seen her?”\n\n“No—I’m to see her to-day.” But Strether wouldn’t linger now on Miss\nGostrey. “Your mother sends me an ultimatum. If I can’t bring you I’m\nto leave you; I’m to come at any rate myself.”\n\n“Ah but you _can_ bring me now,” Chad, from his sofa, reassuringly\nreplied.\n\nStrether had a pause. “I don’t think I understand you. Why was it that,\nmore than a month ago, you put it to me so urgently to let Madame de\nVionnet speak for you?”\n\n“‘Why’?” Chad considered, but he had it at his fingers’ ends. “Why but\nbecause I knew how well she’d do it? It was the way to keep you quiet\nand, to that extent, do you good. Besides,” he happily and comfortably\nexplained, “I wanted you really to know her and to get the impression\nof her—and you see the good that _has_ done you.”\n\n“Well,” said Strether, “the way she has spoken for you, all the same—so\nfar as I’ve given her a chance—has only made me feel how much she\nwishes to keep you. If you make nothing of that I don’t see why you\nwanted me to listen to her.”\n\n“Why my dear man,” Chad exclaimed, “I make everything of it! How can\nyou doubt—?”\n\n“I doubt only because you come to me this morning with your signal to\nstart.”\n\nChad stared, then gave a laugh. “And isn’t my signal to start just what\nyou’ve been waiting for?”\n\nStrether debated; he took another turn. “This last month I’ve been\nawaiting, I think, more than anything else, the message I have here.”\n\n“You mean you’ve been afraid of it?”\n\n“Well, I was doing my business in my own way. And I suppose your\npresent announcement,” Strether went on, “isn’t merely the result of\nyour sense of what I’ve expected. Otherwise you wouldn’t have put me in\nrelation—” But he paused, pulling up.\n\nAt this Chad rose. “Ah _her_ wanting me not to go has nothing to do\nwith it! It’s only because she’s afraid—afraid of the way that, over\nthere, I may get caught. But her fear’s groundless.”\n\nHe had met again his companion’s sufficiently searching look. “Are you\ntired of her?”\n\nChad gave him in reply to this, with a movement of the head, the\nstrangest slow smile he had ever had from him. “Never.”\n\nIt had immediately, on Strether’s imagination, so deep and soft an\neffect that our friend could only for the moment keep it before him.\n“Never?”\n\n“Never,” Chad obligingly and serenely repeated.\n\nIt made his companion take several more steps. “Then _you’re_ not\nafraid.”\n\n“Afraid to go?”\n\nStrether pulled up again. “Afraid to stay.”\n\nThe young man looked brightly amazed. “You want me now to ‘stay’?”\n\n“If I don’t immediately sail the Pococks will immediately come out.\nThat’s what I mean,” said Strether, “by your mother’s ultimatum.”\n\nChad showed a still livelier, but not an alarmed interest. “She has\nturned on Sarah and Jim?”\n\nStrether joined him for an instant in the vision. “Oh and you may be\nsure Mamie. _That’s_ whom she’s turning on.”\n\nThis also Chad saw—he laughed out. “Mamie—to corrupt me?”\n\n“Ah,” said Strether, “she’s very charming.”\n\n“So you’ve already more than once told me. I should like to see her.”\n\nSomething happy and easy, something above all unconscious, in the way\nhe said this, brought home again to his companion the facility of his\nattitude and the enviability of his state. “See her then by all means.\nAnd consider too,” Strether went on, “that you really give your sister\na lift in letting her come to you. You give her a couple of months of\nParis, which she hasn’t seen, if I’m not mistaken, since just after she\nwas married, and which I’m sure she wants but the pretext to visit.”\n\nChad listened, but with all his own knowledge of the world. “She has\nhad it, the pretext, these several years, yet she has never taken it.”\n\n“Do you mean _you?_” Strether after an instant enquired.\n\n“Certainly—the lone exile. And whom do you mean?” said Chad.\n\n“Oh I mean _me_. I’m her pretext. That is—for it comes to the same\nthing—I’m your mother’s.”\n\n“Then why,” Chad asked, “doesn’t Mother come herself?”\n\nHis friend gave him a long look. “Should you like her to?” And as he\nfor the moment said nothing: “It’s perfectly open to you to cable for\nher.”\n\nChad continued to think. “Will she come if I do?”\n\n“Quite possibly. But try, and you’ll see.”\n\n“Why don’t _you_ try?” Chad after a moment asked.\n\n“Because I don’t want to.”\n\nChad thought. “Don’t desire her presence here?”\n\nStrether faced the question, and his answer was the more emphatic.\n“Don’t put it off, my dear boy, on _me!_”\n\n“Well—I see what you mean. I’m sure you’d behave beautifully but you\n_don’t_ want to see her. So I won’t play you that trick.’\n\n“Ah,” Strether declared, “I shouldn’t call it a trick. You’ve a perfect\nright, and it would be perfectly straight of you.” Then he added in a\ndifferent tone: “You’d have moreover, in the person of Madame de\nVionnet, a very interesting relation prepared for her.”\n\nTheir eyes, on this proposition, continued to meet, but Chad’s pleasant\nand bold, never flinched for a moment. He got up at last and he said\nsomething with which Strether was struck. “She wouldn’t understand her,\nbut that makes no difference. Madame de Vionnet would like to see her.\nShe’d like to be charming to her. She believes she could work it.”\n\nStrether thought a moment, affected by this, but finally turning away.\n“She couldn’t!”\n\n“You’re quite sure?” Chad asked.\n\n“Well, risk it if you like!”\n\nStrether, who uttered this with serenity, had urged a plea for their\nnow getting into the air; but the young man still waited. “Have you\nsent your answer?”\n\n“No, I’ve done nothing yet.”\n\n“Were you waiting to see me?”\n\n“No, not that.”\n\n“Only waiting”—and Chad, with this, had a smile for him—“to see Miss\nGostrey?”\n\n“No—not even Miss Gostrey. I wasn’t waiting to see any one. I had only\nwaited, till now, to make up my mind—in complete solitude; and, since I\nof course absolutely owe you the information, was on the point of going\nout with it quite made up. Have therefore a little more patience with\nme. Remember,” Strether went on, “that that’s what you originally asked\n_me_ to have. I’ve had it, you see, and you see what has come of it.\nStay on with me.”\n\nChad looked grave. “How much longer?”\n\n“Well, till I make you a sign. I can’t myself, you know, at the best,\nor at the worst, stay for ever. Let the Pococks come,” Strether\nrepeated.\n\n“Because it gains you time?”\n\n“Yes—it gains me time.”\n\nChad, as if it still puzzled him, waited a minute. “You don’t want to\nget back to Mother?”\n\n“Not just yet. I’m not ready.”\n\n“You feel,” Chad asked in a tone of his own, “the charm of life over\nhere?”\n\n“Immensely.” Strether faced it. “You’ve helped me so to feel it that\nthat surely needn’t surprise you.”\n\n“No, it doesn’t surprise me, and I’m delighted. But what, my dear man,”\nChad went on with conscious queerness, “does it all lead to for you?”\n\nThe change of position and of relation, for each, was so oddly betrayed\nin the question that Chad laughed out as soon as he had uttered\nit—which made Strether also laugh. “Well, to my having a certitude that\nhas been tested—that has passed through the fire. But oh,” he couldn’t\nhelp breaking out, “if within my first month here you had been willing\nto move with me—!”\n\n“Well?” said Chad, while he broke down as for weight of thought.\n\n“Well, we should have been over there by now.”\n\n“Ah but you wouldn’t have had your fun!”\n\n“I should have had a month of it; and I’m having now, if you want to\nknow,” Strether continued, “enough to last me for the rest of my days.”\n\nChad looked amused and interested, yet still somewhat in the dark;\npartly perhaps because Strether’s estimate of fun had required of him\nfrom the first a good deal of elucidation. “It wouldn’t do if I left\nyou—?”\n\n“Left me?”—Strether remained blank.\n\n“Only for a month or two—time to go and come. Madame de Vionnet,” Chad\nsmiled, “would look after you in the interval.”\n\n“To go back by yourself, I remaining here?” Again for an instant their\neyes had the question out; after which Strether said: “Grotesque!”\n\n“But I want to see Mother,” Chad presently returned. “Remember how long\nit is since I’ve seen Mother.”\n\n“Long indeed; and that’s exactly why I was originally so keen for\nmoving you. Hadn’t you shown us enough how beautifully you could do\nwithout it?”\n\n“Oh but,” said Chad wonderfully, “I’m better now.”\n\nThere was an easy triumph in it that made his friend laugh out again.\n“Oh if you were worse I _should_ know what to do with you. In that case\nI believe I’d have you gagged and strapped down, carried on board\nresisting, kicking. How _much_,” Strether asked, “do you want to see\nMother?”\n\n“How much?”—Chad seemed to find it in fact difficult to say.\n\n“How much.”\n\n“Why as much as you’ve made me. I’d give anything to see her. And\nyou’ve left me,” Chad went on, “in little enough doubt as to how much\n_she_ wants it.”\n\nStrether thought a minute. “Well then if those things are really your\nmotive catch the French steamer and sail to-morrow. Of course, when it\ncomes to that, you’re absolutely free to do as you choose. From the\nmoment you can’t hold yourself I can only accept your flight.”\n\n“I’ll fly in a minute then,” said Chad, “if you’ll stay here.”\n\n“I’ll stay here till the next steamer—then I’ll follow you.”\n\n“And do you call that,” Chad asked, “accepting my flight?”\n\n“Certainly—it’s the only thing to call it. The only way to keep me\nhere, accordingly,” Strether explained, “is by staying yourself.”\n\nChad took it in. “All the more that I’ve really dished you, eh?”\n\n“Dished me?” Strether echoed as inexpressively as possible.\n\n“Why if she sends out the Pococks it will be that she doesn’t trust\nyou, and if she doesn’t trust you, that bears upon—well, you know\nwhat.”\n\nStrether decided after a moment that he did know what, and in\nconsonance with this he spoke. “You see then all the more what you owe\nme.”\n\n“Well, if I do see, how can I pay?”\n\n“By not deserting me. By standing by me.”\n\n“Oh I say—!” But Chad, as they went downstairs, clapped a firm hand, in\nthe manner of a pledge, upon his shoulder. They descended slowly\ntogether and had, in the court of the hotel, some further talk, of\nwhich the upshot was that they presently separated. Chad Newsome\ndeparted, and Strether, left alone, looked about, superficially, for\nWaymarsh. But Waymarsh hadn’t yet, it appeared, come down, and our\nfriend finally went forth without sight of him.\n\n\n III\n\nAt four o’clock that afternoon he had still not seen him, but he was\nthen, as to make up for this, engaged in talk about him with Miss\nGostrey. Strether had kept away from home all day, given himself up to\nthe town and to his thoughts, wandered and mused, been at once restless\nand absorbed—and all with the present climax of a rich little welcome\nin the Quartier Marbœuf. “Waymarsh has been, ‘unbeknown’ to me, I’m\nconvinced”—for Miss Gostrey had enquired—“in communication with\nWoollett: the consequence of which was, last night, the loudest\npossible call for me.”\n\n“Do you mean a letter to bring you home?”\n\n“No—a cable, which I have at this moment in my pocket: a ‘Come back by\nthe first ship.’”\n\nStrether’s hostess, it might have been made out, just escaped changing\ncolour. Reflexion arrived but in time and established a provisional\nserenity. It was perhaps exactly this that enabled her to say with\nduplicity: “And you’re going—?”\n\n“You almost deserve it when you abandon me so.”\n\nShe shook her head as if this were not worth taking up. “My absence has\nhelped you—as I’ve only to look at you to see. It was my calculation,\nand I’m justified. You’re not where you were. And the thing,” she\nsmiled, “was for me not to be there either. You can go of yourself.”\n\n“Oh but I feel to-day,” he comfortably declared, “that I shall want you\nyet.”\n\nShe took him all in again. “Well, I promise you not again to leave you,\nbut it will only be to follow you. You’ve got your momentum and can\ntoddle alone.”\n\nHe intelligently accepted it. “Yes—I suppose I can toddle. It’s the\nsight of that in fact that has upset Waymarsh. He can bear it—the way I\nstrike him as going—no longer. That’s only the climax of his original\nfeeling. He wants me to quit; and he must have written to Woollett that\nI’m in peril of perdition.”\n\n“Ah good!” she murmured. “But is it only your supposition?”\n\n“I make it out—it explains.”\n\n“Then he denies?—or you haven’t asked him?”\n\n“I’ve not had time,” Strether said; “I made it out but last night,\nputting various things together, and I’ve not been since then face to\nface with him.”\n\nShe wondered. “Because you’re too disgusted? You can’t trust yourself?”\n\nHe settled his glasses on his nose. “Do I look in a great rage?”\n\n“You look divine!”\n\n“There’s nothing,” he went on, “to be angry about. He has done me on\nthe contrary a service.”\n\nShe made it out. “By bringing things to a head?”\n\n“How well you understand!” he almost groaned. “Waymarsh won’t in the\nleast, at any rate, when I have it out with him, deny or extenuate. He\nhas acted from the deepest conviction, with the best conscience and\nafter wakeful nights. He’ll recognise that he’s fully responsible, and\nwill consider that he has been highly successful; so that any\ndiscussion we may have will bring us quite together again—bridge the\ndark stream that has kept us so thoroughly apart. We shall have at\nlast, in the consequences of his act, something we can definitely talk\nabout.”\n\nShe was silent a little. “How wonderfully you take it! But you’re\nalways wonderful.”\n\nHe had a pause that matched her own; then he had, with an adequate\nspirit, a complete admission. “It’s quite true. I’m extremely wonderful\njust now. I dare say in fact I’m quite fantastic, and I shouldn’t be at\nall surprised if I were mad.”\n\n“Then tell me!” she earnestly pressed. As he, however, for the time\nanswered nothing, only returning the look with which she watched him,\nshe presented herself where it was easier to meet her. “What will Mr.\nWaymarsh exactly have done?”\n\n“Simply have written a letter. One will have been quite enough. He has\ntold them I want looking after.”\n\n“And _do_ you?”—she was all interest.\n\n“Immensely. And I shall get it.”\n\n“By which you mean you don’t budge?”\n\n“I don’t budge.”\n\n“You’ve cabled?”\n\n“No—I’ve made Chad do it.”\n\n“That you decline to come?”\n\n“That _he_ declines. We had it out this morning and I brought him\nround. He had come in, before I was down, to tell me he was\nready—ready, I mean, to return. And he went off, after ten minutes with\nme, to say he wouldn’t.”\n\nMiss Gostrey followed with intensity. “Then you’ve _stopped_ him?”\n\nStrether settled himself afresh in his chair. “I’ve stopped him. That\nis for the time. That”—he gave it to her more vividly—“is where I am.”\n\n“I see, I see. But where’s Mr. Newsome? He was ready,” she asked, “to\ngo?”\n\n“All ready.”\n\n“And sincerely—believing _you’d_ be?”\n\n“Perfectly, I think; so that he was amazed to find the hand I had laid\non him to pull him over suddenly converted into an engine for keeping\nhim still.”\n\nIt was an account of the matter Miss Gostrey could weigh. “Does he\nthink the conversion sudden?”\n\n“Well,” said Strether, “I’m not altogether sure what he thinks. I’m not\nsure of anything that concerns him, except that the more I’ve seen of\nhim the less I’ve found him what I originally expected. He’s obscure,\nand that’s why I’m waiting.”\n\nShe wondered. “But for what in particular?”\n\n“For the answer to his cable.”\n\n“And what was his cable?”\n\n“I don’t know,” Strether replied; “it was to be, when he left me,\naccording to his own taste. I simply said to him: ‘I want to stay, and\nthe only way for me to do so is for _you_ to.’ That I wanted to stay\nseemed to interest him, and he acted on that.”\n\nMiss Gostrey turned it over. “He wants then himself to stay.”\n\n“He half wants it. That is he half wants to go. My original appeal has\nto that extent worked in him. Nevertheless,” Strether pursued, “he\nwon’t go. Not, at least, so long as I’m here.”\n\n“But you can’t,” his companion suggested, “stay here always. I wish you\ncould.”\n\n“By no means. Still, I want to see him a little further. He’s not in\nthe least the case I supposed, he’s quite another case. And it’s as\nsuch that he interests me.” It was almost as if for his own\nintelligence that, deliberate and lucid, our friend thus expressed the\nmatter. “I don’t want to give him up.”\n\nMiss Gostrey but desired to help his lucidity. She had however to be\nlight and tactful. “Up, you mean—a—to his mother?”\n\n“Well, I’m not thinking of his mother now. I’m thinking of the plan of\nwhich I was the mouthpiece, which, as soon as we met, I put before him\nas persuasively as I knew how, and which was drawn up, as it were, in\ncomplete ignorance of all that, in this last long period, has been\nhappening to him. It took no account whatever of the impression I was\nhere on the spot immediately to begin to receive from him—impressions\nof which I feel sure I’m far from having had the last.”\n\nMiss Gostrey had a smile of the most genial criticism. “So your idea\nis—more or less—to stay out of curiosity?”\n\n“Call it what you like! I don’t care what it’s called—”\n\n“So long as you do stay? Certainly not then. I call it, all the same,\nimmense fun,” Maria Gostrey declared; “and to see you work it out will\nbe one of the sensations of my life. It _is_ clear you can toddle\nalone!”\n\nHe received this tribute without elation. “I shan’t be alone when the\nPococks have come.”\n\nHer eyebrows went up. “The Pococks are coming?”\n\n“That, I mean, is what will happen—and happen as quickly as possible—in\nconsequence of Chad’s cable. They’ll simply embark. Sarah will come to\nspeak for her mother—with an effect different from _my_ muddle.”\n\nMiss Gostrey more gravely wondered. “_She_ then will take him back?”\n\n“Very possibly—and we shall see. She must at any rate have the chance,\nand she may be trusted to do all she can.”\n\n“And do you _want_ that?”\n\n“Of course,” said Strether, “I want it. I want to play fair.”\n\nBut she had lost for a moment the thread. “If it devolves on the\nPococks why do you stay?”\n\n“Just to see that I _do_ play fair—and a little also, no doubt, that\nthey do.” Strether was luminous as he had never been. “I came out to\nfind myself in presence of new facts—facts that have kept striking me\nas less and less met by our old reasons. The matter’s perfectly simple.\nNew reasons—reasons as new as the facts themselves—are wanted; and of\nthis our friends at Woollett—Chad’s and mine—were at the earliest\nmoment definitely notified. If any are producible Mrs. Pocock will\nproduce them; she’ll bring over the whole collection. They’ll be,” he\nadded with a pensive smile “a part of the ‘fun’ you speak of.”\n\nShe was quite in the current now and floating by his side. “It’s\nMamie—so far as I’ve had it from you—who’ll be their great card.” And\nthen as his contemplative silence wasn’t a denial she significantly\nadded: “I think I’m sorry for her.”\n\n“I think _I_ am!”—and Strether sprang up, moving about a little as her\neyes followed him. “But it can’t be helped.”\n\n“You mean her coming out can’t be?”\n\nHe explained after another turn what he meant. “The only way for her\nnot to come is for me to go home—as I believe that on the spot I could\nprevent it. But the difficulty as to that is that if I do go home—”\n\n“I see, I see”—she had easily understood. “Mr. Newsome will do the\nsame, and that’s not”—she laughed out now—“to be thought of.”\n\nStrether had no laugh; he had only a quiet comparatively placid look\nthat might have shown him as proof against ridicule. “Strange, isn’t\nit?”\n\nThey had, in the matter that so much interested them, come so far as\nthis without sounding another name—to which however their present\nmomentary silence was full of a conscious reference. Strether’s\nquestion was a sufficient implication of the weight it had gained with\nhim during the absence of his hostess; and just for that reason a\nsingle gesture from her could pass for him as a vivid answer. Yet he\nwas answered still better when she said in a moment: “Will Mr. Newsome\nintroduce his sister—?”\n\n“To Madame de Vionnet?” Strether spoke the name at last. “I shall be\ngreatly surprised if he doesn’t.”\n\nShe seemed to gaze at the possibility. “You mean you’ve thought of it\nand you’re prepared.”\n\n“I’ve thought of it and I’m prepared.”\n\nIt was to her visitor now that she applied her consideration. “Bon! You\n_are_ magnificent!”\n\n“Well,” he answered after a pause and a little wearily, but still\nstanding there before her—“well, that’s what, just once in all my dull\ndays, I think I shall like to have been!”\n\nTwo days later he had news from Chad of a communication from Woollett\nin response to their determinant telegram, this missive being addressed\nto Chad himself and announcing the immediate departure for France of\nSarah and Jim and Mamie. Strether had meanwhile on his own side cabled;\nhe had but delayed that act till after his visit to Miss Gostrey, an\ninterview by which, as so often before, he felt his sense of things\ncleared up and settled. His message to Mrs. Newsome, in answer to her\nown, had consisted of the words: “Judge best to take another month, but\nwith full appreciation of all re-enforcements.” He had added that he\nwas writing, but he was of course always writing; it was a practice\nthat continued, oddly enough, to relieve him, to make him come nearer\nthan anything else to the consciousness of doing something: so that he\noften wondered if he hadn’t really, under his recent stress, acquired\nsome hollow trick, one of the specious arts of make-believe. Wouldn’t\nthe pages he still so freely dispatched by the American post have been\nworthy of a showy journalist, some master of the great new science of\nbeating the sense out of words? Wasn’t he writing against time, and\nmainly to show he was kind?—since it had become quite his habit not to\nlike to read himself over. On those lines he could still be liberal,\nyet it was at best a sort of whistling in the dark. It was\nunmistakeable moreover that the sense of being in the dark now pressed\non him more sharply—creating thereby the need for a louder and livelier\nwhistle. He whistled long and hard after sending his message; he\nwhistled again and again in celebration of Chad’s news; there was an\ninterval of a fortnight in which this exercise helped him. He had no\ngreat notion of what, on the spot, Sarah Pocock would have to say,\nthough he had indeed confused premonitions; but it shouldn’t be in her\npower to say—it shouldn’t be in any one’s anywhere to say—that he was\nneglecting her mother. He might have written before more freely, but he\nhad never written more copiously; and he frankly gave for a reason at\nWoollett that he wished to fill the void created there by Sarah’s\ndeparture.\n\nThe increase of his darkness, however, and the quickening, as I have\ncalled it, of his tune, resided in the fact that he was hearing almost\nnothing. He had for some time been aware that he was hearing less than\nbefore, and he was now clearly following a process by which Mrs.\nNewsome’s letters could but logically stop. He hadn’t had a line for\nmany days, and he needed no proof—though he was, in time, to have\nplenty—that she wouldn’t have put pen to paper after receiving the hint\nthat had determined her telegram. She wouldn’t write till Sarah should\nhave seen him and reported on him. It was strange, though it might well\nbe less so than his own behaviour appeared at Woollett. It was at any\nrate significant, and what _was_ remarkable was the way his friend’s\nnature and manner put on for him, through this very drop of\ndemonstration, a greater intensity. It struck him really that he had\nnever so lived with her as during this period of her silence; the\nsilence was a sacred hush, a finer clearer medium, in which her\nidiosyncrasies showed. He walked about with her, sat with her, drove\nwith her and dined face-to-face with her—a rare treat “in his life,” as\nhe could perhaps have scarce escaped phrasing it; and if he had never\nseen her so soundless he had never, on the other hand, felt her so\nhighly, so almost austerely, herself: pure and by the vulgar estimate\n“cold,” but deep devoted delicate sensitive noble. Her vividness in\nthese respects became for him, in the special conditions, almost an\nobsession; and though the obsession sharpened his pulses, adding really\nto the excitement of life, there were hours at which, to be less on the\nstretch, he directly sought forgetfulness. He knew it for the queerest\nof adventures—a circumstance capable of playing such a part only for\nLambert Strether—that in Paris itself, of all places, he should find\nthis ghost of the lady of Woollett more importunate than any other\npresence.\n\nWhen he went back to Maria Gostrey it was for the change to something\nelse. And yet after all the change scarcely operated for he talked to\nher of Mrs. Newsome in these days as he had never talked before. He had\nhitherto observed in that particular a discretion and a law;\nconsiderations that at present broke down quite as if relations had\naltered. They hadn’t _really_ altered, he said to himself, so much as\nthat came to; for if what had occurred was of course that Mrs. Newsome\nhad ceased to trust him, there was nothing on the other hand to prove\nthat he shouldn’t win back her confidence. It was quite his present\ntheory that he would leave no stone unturned to do so; and in fact if\nhe now told Maria things about her that he had never told before this\nwas largely because it kept before him the idea of the honour of such a\nwoman’s esteem. His relation with Maria as well was, strangely enough,\nno longer quite the same; this truth—though not too disconcertingly—had\ncome up between them on the renewal of their meetings. It was all\ncontained in what she had then almost immediately said to him; it was\nrepresented by the remark she had needed but ten minutes to make and\nthat he hadn’t been disposed to gainsay. He could toddle alone, and the\ndifference that showed was extraordinary. The turn taken by their talk\nhad promptly confirmed this difference; his larger confidence on the\nscore of Mrs. Newsome did the rest; and the time seemed already far off\nwhen he had held out his small thirsty cup to the spout of her pail.\nHer pail was scarce touched now, and other fountains had flowed for\nhim; she fell into her place as but one of his tributaries; and there\nwas a strange sweetness—a melancholy mildness that touched him—in her\nacceptance of the altered order.\n\nIt marked for himself the flight of time, or at any rate what he was\npleased to think of with irony and pity as the rush of experience; it\nhaving been but the day before yesterday that he sat at her feet and\nheld on by her garment and was fed by her hand. It was the proportions\nthat were changed, and the proportions were at all times, he\nphilosophised, the very conditions of perception, the terms of thought.\nIt was as if, with her effective little _entresol_ and and her wide\nacquaintance, her activities, varieties, promiscuities, the duties and\ndevotions that took up nine tenths of her time and of which he got,\nguardedly, but the side-wind—it was as if she had shrunk to a secondary\nelement and had consented to the shrinkage with the perfection of tact.\nThis perfection had never failed her; it had originally been greater\nthan his prime measure for it; it had kept him quite apart, kept him\nout of the shop, as she called her huge general acquaintance, made\ntheir commerce as quiet, as much a thing of the home alone—the opposite\nof the shop—as if she had never another customer. She had been\nwonderful to him at first, with the memory of her little _entresol_,\nthe image to which, on most mornings at that time, his eyes directly\nopened; but now she mainly figured for him as but part of the bristling\ntotal—though of course always as a person to whom he should never cease\nto be indebted. It would never be given to him certainly to inspire a\ngreater kindness. She had decked him out for others, and he saw at this\npoint at least nothing she would ever ask for. She only wondered and\nquestioned and listened, rendering him the homage of a wistful\nspeculation. She expressed it repeatedly; he was already far beyond\nher, and she must prepare herself to lose him. There was but one little\nchance for her.\n\nOften as she had said it he met it—for it was a touch he liked—each\ntime the same way. “My coming to grief?”\n\n“Yes—then I might patch you up.”\n\n“Oh for my real smash, if it takes place, there will be no patching.”\n\n“But you surely don’t mean it will kill you.”\n\n“No—worse. It will make me old.”\n\n“Ah nothing can do that! The wonderful and special thing about you is\nthat you _are_, at this time of day, youth.” Then she always made,\nfurther, one of those remarks that she had completely ceased to adorn\nwith hesitations or apologies, and that had, by the same token, in\nspite of their extreme straightness, ceased to produce in Strether the\nleast embarrassment. She made him believe them, and they became thereby\nas impersonal as truth itself. “It’s just your particular charm.”\n\nHis answer too was always the same. “Of course I’m youth—youth for the\ntrip to Europe. I began to be young, or at least to get the benefit of\nit, the moment I met you at Chester, and that’s what has been taking\nplace ever since. I never had the benefit at the proper time—which\ncomes to saying that I never had the thing itself. I’m having the\nbenefit at this moment; I had it the other day when I said to Chad\n‘Wait’; I shall have it still again when Sarah Pocock arrives. It’s a\nbenefit that would make a poor show for many people; and I don’t know\nwho else but you and I, frankly, could begin to see in it what I feel.\nI don’t get drunk; I don’t pursue the ladies; I don’t spend money; I\ndon’t even write sonnets. But nevertheless I’m making up late for what\nI didn’t have early. I cultivate my little benefit in my own little\nway. It amuses me more than anything that has happened to me in all my\nlife. They may say what they like—it’s my surrender, it’s my tribute,\nto youth. One puts that in where one can—it has to come in somewhere,\nif only out of the lives, the conditions, the feelings of other\npersons. Chad gives me the sense of it, for all his grey hairs, which\nmerely make it solid in him and safe and serene; and _she_ does the\nsame, for all her being older than he, for all her marriageable\ndaughter, her separated husband, her agitated history. Though they’re\nyoung enough, my pair, I don’t say they’re, in the freshest way, their\n_own_ absolutely prime adolescence; for that has nothing to do with it.\nThe point is that they’re mine. Yes, they’re my youth; since somehow at\nthe right time nothing else ever was. What I meant just now therefore\nis that it would all go—go before doing its work—if they were to fail\nme.”\n\nOn which, just here, Miss Gostrey inveterately questioned. “What do\nyou, in particular, call its work?”\n\n“Well, to see me through.”\n\n“But through what?”—she liked to get it all out of him.\n\n“Why through this experience.” That was all that would come.\n\nIt regularly gave her none the less the last word. “Don’t you remember\nhow in those first days of our meeting it was _I_ who was to see you\nthrough?”\n\n“Remember? Tenderly, deeply”—he always rose to it. “You’re just doing\nyour part in letting me maunder to you thus.”\n\n“Ah don’t speak as if my part were small; since whatever else fails\nyou—”\n\n“_You_ won’t, ever, ever, ever?”—he thus took her up. “Oh I beg your\npardon; you necessarily, you inevitably _will_. Your conditions—that’s\nwhat I mean—won’t allow me anything to do for you.”\n\n“Let alone—I see what you mean—that I’m drearily dreadfully old. I\n_am_, but there’s a service—possible for you to render—that I know, all\nthe same, I shall think of.”\n\n“And what will it be?”\n\nThis, in fine, however, she would never tell him. “You shall hear only\nif your smash takes place. As that’s really out of the question, I\nwon’t expose myself”—a point at which, for reasons of his own, Strether\nceased to press.\n\nHe came round, for publicity—it was the easiest thing—to the idea that\nhis smash _was_ out of the question, and this rendered idle the\ndiscussion of what might follow it. He attached an added importance, as\nthe days elapsed, to the arrival of the Pococks; he had even a shameful\nsense of waiting for it insincerely and incorrectly. He accused himself\nof making believe to his own mind that Sarah’s presence, her\nimpression, her judgement would simplify and harmonise, he accused\nhimself of being so afraid of what they _might_ do that he sought\nrefuge, to beg the whole question, in a vain fury. He had abundantly\nseen at home what they were in the habit of doing, and he had not at\npresent the smallest ground. His clearest vision was when he made out\nthat what he most desired was an account more full and free of Mrs.\nNewsome’s state of mind than any he felt he could now expect from\nherself; that calculation at least went hand in hand with the sharp\nconsciousness of wishing to prove to himself that he was not afraid to\nlook his behaviour in the face. If he was by an inexorable logic to pay\nfor it he was literally impatient to know the cost, and he held himself\nready to pay in instalments. The first instalment would be precisely\nthis entertainment of Sarah; as a consequence of which moreover, he\nshould know vastly better how he stood.\n\n\nBook Eighth\n\n\n I\n\nStrether rambled alone during these few days, the effect of the\nincident of the previous week having been to simplify in a marked\nfashion his mixed relations with Waymarsh. Nothing had passed between\nthem in reference to Mrs. Newsome’s summons but that our friend had\nmentioned to his own the departure of the deputation actually at\nsea—giving him thus an opportunity to confess to the occult\nintervention he imputed to him. Waymarsh however in the event confessed\nto nothing; and though this falsified in some degree Strether’s\nforecast the latter amusedly saw in it the same depth of good\nconscience out of which the dear man’s impertinence had originally\nsprung. He was patient with the dear man now and delighted to observe\nhow unmistakeably he had put on flesh; he felt his own holiday so\nsuccessfully large and free that he was full of allowances and\ncharities in respect to those cabined and confined: his instinct toward\na spirit so strapped down as Waymarsh’s was to walk round it on tiptoe\nfor fear of waking it up to a sense of losses by this time\nirretrievable. It was all very funny he knew, and but the difference,\nas he often said to himself, of tweedledum and tweedledee—an\nemancipation so purely comparative that it was like the advance of the\ndoor-mat on the scraper; yet the present crisis was happily to profit\nby it and the pilgrim from Milrose to know himself more than ever in\nthe right.\n\nStrether felt that when he heard of the approach of the Pococks the\nimpulse of pity quite sprang up in him beside the impulse of triumph.\nThat was exactly why Waymarsh had looked at him with eyes in which the\nheat of justice was measured and shaded. He had looked very hard, as if\naffectionately sorry for the friend—the friend of fifty-five—whose\nfrivolity had had thus to be recorded; becoming, however, but obscurely\nsententious and leaving his companion to formulate a charge. It was in\nthis general attitude that he had of late altogether taken refuge; with\nthe drop of discussion they were solemnly sadly superficial; Strether\nrecognised in him the mere portentous rumination to which Miss Barrace\nhad so good-humouredly described herself as assigning a corner of her\nsalon. It was quite as if he knew his surreptitious step had been\ndivined, and it was also as if he missed the chance to explain the\npurity of his motive; but this privation of relief should be precisely\nhis small penance: it was not amiss for Strether that he should find\nhimself to that degree uneasy. If he had been challenged or accused,\nrebuked for meddling or otherwise pulled up, he would probably have\nshown, on his own system, all the height of his consistency, all the\ndepth of his good faith. Explicit resentment of his course would have\nmade him take the floor, and the thump of his fist on the table would\nhave affirmed him as consciously incorruptible. Had what now really\nprevailed with Strether been but a dread of that thump—a dread of\nwincing a little painfully at what it might invidiously demonstrate?\nHowever this might be, at any rate, one of the marks of the crisis was\na visible, a studied lapse, in Waymarsh, of betrayed concern. As if to\nmake up to his comrade for the stroke by which he had played providence\nhe now conspicuously ignored his movements, withdrew himself from the\npretension to share them, stiffened up his sensibility to neglect, and,\nclasping his large empty hands and swinging his large restless foot,\nclearly looked to another quarter for justice.\n\nThis made for independence on Strether’s part, and he had in truth at\nno moment of his stay been so free to go and come. The early summer\nbrushed the picture over and blurred everything but the near; it made a\nvast warm fragrant medium in which the elements floated together on the\nbest of terms, in which rewards were immediate and reckonings\npostponed. Chad was out of town again, for the first time since his\nvisitor’s first view of him; he had explained this necessity—without\ndetail, yet also without embarrassment, the circumstance was one of\nthose which, in the young man’s life, testified to the variety of his\nties. Strether wasn’t otherwise concerned with it than for its so\ntestifying—a pleasant multitudinous image in which he took comfort. He\ntook comfort, by the same stroke, in the swing of Chad’s pendulum back\nfrom that other swing, the sharp jerk towards Woollett, so stayed by\nhis own hand. He had the entertainment of thinking that if he had for\nthat moment stopped the clock it was to promote the next minute this\nstill livelier motion. He himself did what he hadn’t done before; he\ntook two or three times whole days off—irrespective of others, of two\nor three taken with Miss Gostrey, two or three taken with little\nBilham: he went to Chartres and cultivated, before the front of the\ncathedral, a general easy beatitude; he went to Fontainebleau and\nimagined himself on the way to Italy; he went to Rouen with a little\nhandbag and inordinately spent the night.\n\nOne afternoon he did something quite different; finding himself in the\nneighbourhood of a fine old house across the river, he passed under the\ngreat arch of its doorway and asked at the porter’s lodge for Madame de\nVionnet. He had already hovered more than once about that possibility,\nbeen aware of it, in the course of ostensible strolls, as lurking but\nround the corner. Only it had perversely happened, after his morning at\nNotre Dame, that his consistency, as he considered and intended it, had\ncome back to him; whereby he had reflected that the encounter in\nquestion had been none of his making; clinging again intensely to the\nstrength of his position, which was precisely that there was nothing in\nit for himself. From the moment he actively pursued the charming\nassociate of his adventure, from that moment his position weakened, for\nhe was then acting in an interested way. It was only within a few days\nthat he had fixed himself a limit: he promised himself his consistency\nshould end with Sarah’s arrival. It was arguing correctly to feel the\ntitle to a free hand conferred on him by this event. If he wasn’t to be\nlet alone he should be merely a dupe to act with delicacy. If he wasn’t\nto be trusted he could at least take his ease. If he was to be placed\nunder control he gained leave to try what his position _might_\nagreeably give him. An ideal rigour would perhaps postpone the trial\ntill after the Pococks had shown their spirit; and it was to an ideal\nrigour that he had quite promised himself to conform.\n\nSuddenly, however, on this particular day, he felt a particular fear\nunder which everything collapsed. He knew abruptly that he was afraid\nof himself—and yet not in relation to the effect on his sensibilities\nof another hour of Madame de Vionnet. What he dreaded was the effect of\na single hour of Sarah Pocock, as to whom he was visited, in troubled\nnights, with fantastic waking dreams. She loomed at him larger than\nlife; she increased in volume as she drew nearer; she so met his eyes\nthat, his imagination taking, after the first step, all, and more than\nall, the strides, he already felt her come down on him, already burned,\nunder her reprobation, with the blush of guilt, already consented, by\nway of penance, to the instant forfeiture of everything. He saw\nhimself, under her direction, recommitted to Woollett as juvenile\noffenders are committed to reformatories. It wasn’t of course that\nWoollett was really a place of discipline; but he knew in advance that\nSarah’s salon at the hotel would be. His danger, at any rate, in such\nmoods of alarm, was some concession, on this ground, that would involve\na sharp rupture with the actual; therefore if he waited to take leave\nof that actual he might wholly miss his chance. It was represented with\nsupreme vividness by Madame de Vionnet, and that is why, in a word, he\nwaited no longer. He had seen in a flash that he must anticipate Mrs.\nPocock. He was accordingly much disappointed on now learning from the\nportress that the lady of his quest was not in Paris. She had gone for\nsome days to the country. There was nothing in this accident but what\nwas natural; yet it produced for poor Strether a drop of all\nconfidence. It was suddenly as if he should never see her again, and as\nif moreover he had brought it on himself by not having been quite kind\nto her.\n\nIt was the advantage of his having let his fancy lose itself for a\nlittle in the gloom that, as by reaction, the prospect began really to\nbrighten from the moment the deputation from Woollett alighted on the\nplatform of the station. They had come straight from Havre, having\nsailed from New York to that port, and having also, thanks to a happy\nvoyage, made land with a promptitude that left Chad Newsome, who had\nmeant to meet them at the dock, belated. He had received their\ntelegram, with the announcement of their immediate further advance,\njust as he was taking the train for Havre, so that nothing had remained\nfor him but to await them in Paris. He hastily picked up Strether, at\nthe hotel, for this purpose, and he even, with easy pleasantry,\nsuggested the attendance of Waymarsh as well—Waymarsh, at the moment\nhis cab rattled up, being engaged, under Strether’s contemplative\nrange, in a grave perambulation of the familiar court. Waymarsh had\nlearned from his companion, who had already had a note, delivered by\nhand, from Chad, that the Pococks were due, and had ambiguously,\nthough, as always, impressively, glowered at him over the circumstance;\ncarrying himself in a manner in which Strether was now expert enough to\nrecognise his uncertainty, in the premises, as to the best tone. The\nonly tone he aimed at with confidence was a full tone—which was\nnecessarily difficult in the absence of a full knowledge. The Pococks\nwere a quantity as yet unmeasured, and, as he had practically brought\nthem over, so this witness had to that extent exposed himself. He\nwanted to feel right about it, but could only, at the best, for the\ntime, feel vague. “I shall look to you, you know, immensely,” our\nfriend had said, “to help me with them,” and he had been quite\nconscious of the effect of the remark, and of others of the same sort,\non his comrade’s sombre sensibility. He had insisted on the fact that\nWaymarsh would quite like Mrs. Pocock—one could be certain he would: he\nwould be with her about everything, and she would also be with _him_,\nand Miss Barrace’s nose, in short, would find itself out of joint.\n\nStrether had woven this web of cheerfulness while they waited in the\ncourt for Chad; he had sat smoking cigarettes to keep himself quiet\nwhile, caged and leonine, his fellow traveller paced and turned before\nhim. Chad Newsome was doubtless to be struck, when he arrived, with the\nsharpness of their opposition at this particular hour; he was to\nremember, as a part of it, how Waymarsh came with him and with Strether\nto the street and stood there with a face half-wistful and half-rueful.\nThey talked of him, the two others, as they drove, and Strether put\nChad in possession of much of his own strained sense of things. He had\nalready, a few days before, named to him the wire he was convinced\ntheir friend had pulled—a confidence that had made on the young man’s\npart quite hugely for curiosity and diversion. The action of the\nmatter, moreover, Strether could see, was to penetrate; he saw that is,\nhow Chad judged a system of influence in which Waymarsh had served as a\ndeterminant—an impression just now quickened again; with the whole\nbearing of such a fact on the youth’s view of his relatives. As it came\nup between them that they might now take their friend for a feature of\nthe control of these latter now sought to be exerted from Woollett,\nStrether felt indeed how it would be stamped all over him, half an hour\nlater for Sarah Pocock’s eyes, that he was as much on Chad’s “side” as\nWaymarsh had probably described him. He was letting himself at present,\ngo; there was no denying it; it might be desperation, it might be\nconfidence; he should offer himself to the arriving travellers\nbristling with all the lucidity he had cultivated.\n\nHe repeated to Chad what he had been saying in the court to Waymarsh;\nhow there was no doubt whatever that his sister would find the latter a\nkindred spirit, no doubt of the alliance, based on an exchange of\nviews, that the pair would successfully strike up. They would become as\nthick as thieves—which moreover was but a development of what Strether\nremembered to have said in one of his first discussions with his mate,\nstruck as he had then already been with the elements of affinity\nbetween that personage and Mrs. Newsome herself. “I told him, one day,\nwhen he had questioned me on your mother, that she was a person who,\nwhen he should know her, would rouse in him, I was sure, a special\nenthusiasm; and that hangs together with the conviction we now\nfeel—this certitude that Mrs. Pocock will take him into her boat. For\nit’s your mother’s own boat that she’s pulling.”\n\n“Ah,” said Chad, “Mother’s worth fifty of Sally!”\n\n“A thousand; but when you presently meet her, all the same you’ll be\nmeeting your mother’s representative—just as I shall. I feel like the\noutgoing ambassador,” said Strether, “doing honour to his appointed\nsuccessor.” A moment after speaking as he had just done he felt he had\ninadvertently rather cheapened Mrs. Newsome to her son; an impression\naudibly reflected, as at first seen, in Chad’s prompt protest. He had\nrecently rather failed of apprehension of the young man’s attitude and\ntemper—remaining principally conscious of how little worry, at the\nworst, he wasted, and he studied him at this critical hour with renewed\ninterest. Chad had done exactly what he had promised him a fortnight\nprevious—had accepted without another question his plea for delay. He\nwas waiting cheerfully and handsomely, but also inscrutably and with a\nslight increase perhaps of the hardness originally involved in his\nacquired high polish. He was neither excited nor depressed; was easy\nand acute and deliberate—unhurried unflurried unworried, only at most a\nlittle less amused than usual. Strether felt him more than ever a\njustification of the extraordinary process of which his own absurd\nspirit had been the arena; he knew as their cab rolled along, knew as\nhe hadn’t even yet known, that nothing else than what Chad had done and\nhad been would have led to his present showing. They had made him,\nthese things, what he was, and the business hadn’t been easy; it had\ntaken time and trouble, it had cost, above all, a price. The result at\nany rate was now to be offered to Sally; which Strether, so far as that\nwas concerned, was glad to be there to witness. Would she in the least\nmake it out or take it in, the result, or would she in the least care\nfor it if she did? He scratched his chin as he asked himself by what\nname, when challenged—as he was sure he should be—he could call it for\nher. Oh those were determinations she must herself arrive at; since she\nwanted so much to see, let her see then and welcome. She had come out\nin the pride of her competence, yet it hummed in Strether’s inner sense\nthat she practically wouldn’t see.\n\nThat this was moreover what Chad shrewdly suspected was clear from a\nword that next dropped from him. “They’re children; they play at\nlife!”—and the exclamation was significant and reassuring. It implied\nthat he hadn’t then, for his companion’s sensibility, appeared to give\nMrs. Newsome away; and it facilitated our friend’s presently asking him\nif it were his idea that Mrs. Pocock and Madame de Vionnet should\nbecome acquainted. Strether was still more sharply struck, hereupon,\nwith Chad’s lucidity. “Why, isn’t that exactly—to get a sight of the\ncompany I keep—what she has come out for?”\n\n“Yes—I’m afraid it is,” Strether unguardedly replied.\n\nChad’s quick rejoinder lighted his precipitation. “Why do you say\nyou’re afraid?”\n\n“Well, because I feel a certain responsibility. It’s my testimony, I\nimagine, that will have been at the bottom of Mrs. Pocock’s curiosity.\nMy letters, as I’ve supposed you to understand from the beginning, have\nspoken freely. I’ve certainly said my little say about Madame de\nVionnet.”\n\nAll that, for Chad, was beautifully obvious. “Yes, but you’ve only\nspoken handsomely.”\n\n“Never more handsomely of any woman. But it’s just that tone—!”\n\n“That tone,” said Chad, “that has fetched her? I dare say; but I’ve no\nquarrel with you about it. And no more has Madame de Vionnet. Don’t you\nknow by this time how she likes you?”\n\n“Oh!”—and Strether had, with his groan, a real pang of melancholy. “For\nall I’ve done for her!”\n\n“Ah you’ve done a great deal.”\n\nChad’s urbanity fairly shamed him, and he was at this moment absolutely\nimpatient to see the face Sarah Pocock would present to a sort of\nthing, as he synthetically phrased it to himself, with no adequate\nforecast of which, despite his admonitions, she would certainly arrive.\n“I’ve done _this!_”\n\n“Well, this is all right. She likes,” Chad comfortably remarked, “to be\nliked.”\n\n\nIt gave his companion a moment’s thought. “And she’s sure Mrs. Pocock\n_will_—?”\n\n“No, I say that for you. She likes your liking her; it’s so much, as it\nwere,” Chad laughed, “to the good. However, she doesn’t despair of\nSarah either, and is prepared, on her own side, to go all lengths.”\n\n“In the way of appreciation?”\n\n“Yes, and of everything else. In the way of general amiability,\nhospitality and welcome. She’s under arms,” Chad laughed again; “she’s\nprepared.”\n\nStrether took it in; then as if an echo of Miss Barrace were in the\nair: “She’s wonderful.”\n\n“You don’t begin to know _how_ wonderful!”\n\nThere was a depth in it, to Strether’s ear, of confirmed luxury—almost\na kind of unconscious insolence of proprietorship; but the effect of\nthe glimpse was not at this moment to foster speculation: there was\nsomething so conclusive in so much graceful and generous assurance. It\nwas in fact a fresh evocation; and the evocation had before many\nminutes another consequence. “Well, I shall see her oftener now. I\nshall see her as much as I like—by your leave; which is what I hitherto\nhaven’t done.”\n\n“It has been,” said Chad, but without reproach, “only your own fault. I\ntried to bring you together, and _she_, my dear fellow—I never saw her\nmore charming to any man. But you’ve got your extraordinary ideas.”\n\n“Well, I _did_ have,” Strether murmured, while he felt both how they\nhad possessed him and how they had now lost their authority. He\ncouldn’t have traced the sequence to the end, but it was all because of\nMrs. Pocock. Mrs. Pocock might be because of Mrs. Newsome, but that was\nstill to be proved. What came over him was the sense of having stupidly\nfailed to profit where profit would have been precious. It had been\nopen to him to see so much more of her, and he had but let the good\ndays pass. Fierce in him almost was the resolve to lose no more of\nthem, and he whimsically reflected, while at Chad’s side he drew nearer\nto his destination, that it was after all Sarah who would have\nquickened his chance. What her visit of inquisition might achieve in\nother directions was as yet all obscure—only not obscure that it would\ndo supremely much to bring two earnest persons together. He had but to\nlisten to Chad at this moment to feel it; for Chad was in the act of\nremarking to him that they of course both counted on him—he himself and\nthe other earnest person—for cheer and support. It was brave to\nStrether to hear him talk as if the line of wisdom they had struck out\nwas to make things ravishing to the Pococks. No, if Madame de Vionnet\ncompassed _that_, compassed the ravishment of the Pococks, Madame de\nVionnet would be prodigious. It would be a beautiful plan if it\nsucceeded, and it all came to the question of Sarah’s being really\nbribeable. The precedent of his own case helped Strether perhaps but\nlittle to consider she might prove so; it being distinct that her\ncharacter would rather make for every possible difference. This idea of\nhis own bribeability set him apart for himself; with the further mark\nin fact that his case was absolutely proved. He liked always, where\nLambert Strether was concerned, to know the worst, and what he now\nseemed to know was not only that he was bribeable, but that he had been\neffectually bribed. The only difficulty was that he couldn’t quite have\nsaid with what. It was as if he had sold himself, but hadn’t somehow\ngot the cash. That, however, was what, characteristically, _would_\nhappen to him. It would naturally be his kind of traffic. While he\nthought of these things he reminded Chad of the truth they mustn’t lose\nsight of—the truth that, with all deference to her susceptibility to\nnew interests, Sarah would have come out with a high firm definite\npurpose. “She hasn’t come out, you know, to be bamboozled. We may all\nbe ravishing—nothing perhaps can be more easy for us; but she hasn’t\ncome out to be ravished. She has come out just simply to take you\nhome.”\n\n“Oh well, with _her_ I’ll go,” said Chad good-humouredly. “I suppose\nyou’ll allow _that_.” And then as for a minute Strether said nothing:\n“Or is your idea that when I’ve seen her I shan’t want to go?” As this\nquestion, however, again left his friend silent he presently went on:\n“My own idea at any rate is that they shall have while they’re here the\nbest sort of time.”\n\nIt was at this that Strether spoke. “Ah there you are! I think if you\nreally wanted to go—!”\n\n“Well?” said Chad to bring it out.\n\n“Well, you wouldn’t trouble about our good time. You wouldn’t care what\nsort of a time we have.”\n\nChad could always take in the easiest way in the world any ingenious\nsuggestion. “I see. But can I help it? I’m too decent.”\n\n“Yes, you’re too decent!” Strether heavily sighed. And he felt for the\nmoment as if it were the preposterous end of his mission.\n\nIt ministered for the time to this temporary effect that Chad made no\nrejoinder. But he spoke again as they came in sight of the station. “Do\nyou mean to introduce her to Miss Gostrey?”\n\nAs to this Strether was ready. “No.”\n\n“But haven’t you told me they know about her?”\n\n“I think I’ve told you your mother knows.”\n\n“And won’t she have told Sally?”\n\n“That’s one of the things I want to see.”\n\n“And if you find she _has_—?”\n\n“Will I then, you mean, bring them together?”\n\n“Yes,” said Chad with his pleasant promptness: “to show her there’s\nnothing in it.”\n\nStrether hesitated. “I don’t know that I care very much what she may\nthink there’s in it.”\n\n“Not if it represents what Mother thinks?”\n\n“Ah what _does_ your mother think?” There was in this some sound of\nbewilderment.\n\nBut they were just driving up, and help, of a sort, might after all be\nquite at hand. “Isn’t that, my dear man, what we’re both just going to\nmake out?”\n\n\n II\n\nStrether quitted the station half an hour later in different company.\nChad had taken charge, for the journey to the hotel, of Sarah, Mamie,\nthe maid and the luggage, all spaciously installed and conveyed; and it\nwas only after the four had rolled away that his companion got into a\ncab with Jim. A strange new feeling had come over Strether, in\nconsequence of which his spirits had risen; it was as if what had\noccurred on the alighting of his critics had been something other than\nhis fear, though his fear had yet not been of an instant scene of\nviolence. His impression had been nothing but what was inevitable—he\nsaid that to himself; yet relief and reassurance had softly dropped\nupon him. Nothing could be so odd as to be indebted for these things to\nthe look of faces and the sound of voices that had been with him to\nsatiety, as he might have said, for years; but he now knew, all the\nsame, how uneasy he had felt; that was brought home to him by his\npresent sense of a respite. It had come moreover in the flash of an\neye, it had come in the smile with which Sarah, whom, at the window of\nher compartment, they had effusively greeted from the platform, rustled\ndown to them a moment later, fresh and handsome from her cool June\nprogress through the charming land. It was only a sign, but enough: she\nwas going to be gracious and unallusive, she was going to play the\nlarger game—which was still more apparent, after she had emerged from\nChad’s arms, in her direct greeting to the valued friend of her family.\n\nStrether _was_ then as much as ever the valued friend of her family, it\nwas something he could at all events go on with; and the manner of his\nresponse to it expressed even for himself how little he had enjoyed the\nprospect of ceasing to figure in that likeness. He had always seen\nSarah gracious—had in fact rarely seen her shy or dry, her marked\nthin-lipped smile, intense without brightness and as prompt to act as\nthe scrape of a safety-match; the protrusion of her rather remarkably\nlong chin, which in her case represented invitation and urbanity, and\nnot, as in most others, pugnacity and defiance; the penetration of her\nvoice to a distance, the general encouragement and approval of her\nmanner, were all elements with which intercourse had made him familiar,\nbut which he noted today almost as if she had been a new acquaintance.\nThis first glimpse of her had given a brief but vivid accent to her\nresemblance to her mother; he could have taken her for Mrs. Newsome\nwhile she met his eyes as the train rolled into the station. It was an\nimpression that quickly dropped; Mrs. Newsome was much handsomer, and\nwhile Sarah inclined to the massive her mother had, at an age, still\nthe girdle of a maid; also the latter’s chin was rather short, than\nlong, and her smile, by good fortune, much more, oh ever so much more,\nmercifully vague. Strether had seen Mrs. Newsome reserved; he had\nliterally heard her silent, though he had never known her unpleasant.\nIt was the case with Mrs. Pocock that he had known _her_ unpleasant,\neven though he had never known her not affable. She had forms of\naffability that were in a high degree assertive; nothing for instance\nhad ever been more striking than that she was affable to Jim.\n\nWhat had told in any case at the window of the train was her high clear\nforehead, that forehead which her friends, for some reason, always\nthought of as a “brow”; the long reach of her eyes—it came out at this\njuncture in such a manner as to remind him, oddly enough, also of that\nof Waymarsh’s; and the unusual gloss of her dark hair, dressed and\nhatted, after her mother’s refined example, with such an avoidance of\nextremes that it was always spoken of at Woollett as “their own.”\nThough this analogy dropped as soon as she was on the platform it had\nlasted long enough to make him feel all the advantage, as it were, of\nhis relief. The woman at home, the woman to whom he was attached, was\nbefore him just long enough to give him again the measure of the\nwretchedness, in fact really of the shame, of their having to recognise\nthe formation, between them, of a “split.” He had taken this measure in\nsolitude and meditation: but the catastrophe, as Sarah steamed up,\nlooked for its seconds unprecedentedly dreadful—or proved, more\nexactly, altogether unthinkable; so that his finding something free and\nfamiliar to respond to brought with it an instant renewal of his\nloyalty. He had suddenly sounded the whole depth, had gasped at what he\nmight have lost.\n\nWell, he could now, for the quarter of an hour of their detention hover\nabout the travellers as soothingly as if their direct message to him\nwas that he had lost nothing. He wasn’t going to have Sarah write to\nher mother that night that he was in any way altered or strange. There\nhad been times enough for a month when it had seemed to him that he was\nstrange, that he was altered, in every way; but that was a matter for\nhimself; he knew at least whose business it was _not_; it was not at\nall events such a circumstance as Sarah’s own unaided lights would help\nher to. Even if she had come out to flash those lights more than yet\nappeared she wouldn’t make much headway against mere pleasantness. He\ncounted on being able to be merely pleasant to the end, and if only\nfrom incapacity moreover to formulate anything different. He couldn’t\neven formulate to himself his being changed and queer; it had taken\nplace, the process, somewhere deep down; Maria Gostrey had caught\nglimpses of it; but how was he to fish it up, even if he desired, for\nMrs. Pocock? This was then the spirit in which he hovered, and with the\neasier throb in it much indebted furthermore to the impression of high\nand established adequacy as a pretty girl promptly produced in him by\nMamie. He had wondered vaguely—turning over many things in the fidget\nof his thoughts—if Mamie _were_ as pretty as Woollett published her; as\nto which issue seeing her now again was to be so swept away by\nWoollett’s opinion that this consequence really let loose for the\nimagination an avalanche of others. There were positively five minutes\nin which the last word seemed of necessity to abide with a Woollett\nrepresented by a Mamie. This was the sort of truth the place itself\nwould feel; it would send her forth in confidence; it would point to\nher with triumph; it would take its stand on her with assurance; it\nwould be conscious of no requirements she didn’t meet, of no question\nshe couldn’t answer.\n\nWell, it was right, Strether slipped smoothly enough into the\ncheerfulness of saying: granted that a community _might_ be best\nrepresented by a young lady of twenty-two, Mamie perfectly played the\npart, played it as if she were used to it, and looked and spoke and\ndressed the character. He wondered if she mightn’t, in the high light\nof Paris, a cool full studio-light, becoming yet treacherous, show as\ntoo conscious of these matters; but the next moment he felt satisfied\nthat her consciousness was after all empty for its size, rather too\nsimple than too mixed, and that the kind way with her would be not to\ntake many things out of it, but to put as many as possible in. She was\nrobust and conveniently tall; just a trifle too bloodlessly fair\nperhaps, but with a pleasant public familiar radiance that affirmed her\nvitality. She might have been “receiving” for Woollett, wherever she\nfound herself, and there was something in her manner, her tone, her\nmotion, her pretty blue eyes, her pretty perfect teeth and her very\nsmall, too small, nose, that immediately placed her, to the fancy,\nbetween the windows of a hot bright room in which voices were high—up\nat that end to which people were brought to be “presented.” They were\nthere to congratulate, these images, and Strether’s renewed vision, on\nthis hint, completed the idea. What Mamie was like was the happy bride,\nthe bride after the church and just before going away. She wasn’t the\nmere maiden, and yet was only as much married as that quantity came to.\nShe was in the brilliant acclaimed festal stage. Well, might it last\nher long!\n\nStrether rejoiced in these things for Chad, who was all genial\nattention to the needs of his friends, besides having arranged that his\nservant should reinforce him; the ladies were certainly pleasant to\nsee, and Mamie would be at any time and anywhere pleasant to exhibit.\nShe would look extraordinarily like his young wife—the wife of a\nhoneymoon, should he go about with her; but that was his own affair—or\nperhaps it was hers; it was at any rate something she couldn’t help.\nStrether remembered how he had seen him come up with Jeanne de Vionnet\nin Gloriani’s garden, and the fancy he had had about that—the fancy\nobscured now, thickly overlaid with others; the recollection was during\nthese minutes his only note of trouble. He had often, in spite of\nhimself, wondered if Chad but too probably were not with Jeanne the\nobject of a still and shaded flame. It was on the cards that the child\n_might_ be tremulously in love, and this conviction now flickered up\nnot a bit the less for his disliking to think of it, for its being, in\na complicated situation, a complication the more, and for something\nindescribable in Mamie, something at all events straightway lent her by\nhis own mind, something that gave her value, gave her intensity and\npurpose, as the symbol of an opposition. Little Jeanne wasn’t really at\nall in question—how _could_ she be?—yet from the moment Miss Pocock had\nshaken her skirts on the platform, touched up the immense bows of her\nhat and settled properly over her shoulder the strap of her\nmorocco-and-gilt travelling-satchel, from that moment little Jeanne was\nopposed.\n\nIt was in the cab with Jim that impressions really crowded on Strether,\ngiving him the strangest sense of length of absence from people among\nwhom he had lived for years. Having them thus come out to him was as if\nhe had returned to find them: and the droll promptitude of Jim’s mental\nreaction threw his own initiation far back into the past. Whoever might\nor mightn’t be suited by what was going on among them, Jim, for one,\nwould certainly be: his instant recognition—frank and whimsical—of what\nthe affair was for _him_ gave Strether a glow of pleasure. “I say, you\nknow, this _is_ about my shape, and if it hadn’t been for _you_—!” so\nhe broke out as the charming streets met his healthy appetite; and he\nwound up, after an expressive nudge, with a clap of his companion’s\nknee and an “Oh you, you—you _are_ doing it!” that was charged with\nrich meaning. Strether felt in it the intention of homage, but, with a\ncuriosity otherwise occupied, postponed taking it up. What he was\nasking himself for the time was how Sarah Pocock, in the opportunity\nalready given her, had judged her brother—from whom he himself, as they\nfinally, at the station, separated for their different conveyances, had\nhad a look into which he could read more than one message. However\nSarah was judging her brother, Chad’s conclusion about his sister, and\nabout her husband and her husband’s sister, was at the least on the way\nnot to fail of confidence. Strether felt the confidence, and that, as\nthe look between them was an exchange, what he himself gave back was\nrelatively vague. This comparison of notes however could wait;\neverything struck him as depending on the effect produced by Chad.\nNeither Sarah nor Mamie had in any way, at the station—where they had\nhad after all ample time—broken out about it; which, to make up for\nthis, was what our friend had expected of Jim as soon as they should\nfind themselves together.\n\nIt was queer to him that he had that noiseless brush with Chad; an\nironic intelligence with this youth on the subject of his relatives, an\nintelligence carried on under their nose and, as might be said, at\ntheir expense—such a matter marked again for him strongly the number of\nstages he had come; albeit that if the number seemed great the time\ntaken for the final one was but the turn of a hand. He had before this\nhad many moments of wondering if he himself weren’t perhaps changed\neven as Chad was changed. Only what in Chad was conspicuous\nimprovement—well, he had no name ready for the working, in his own\norganism, of his own more timid dose. He should have to see first what\nthis action would amount to. And for his occult passage with the young\nman, after all, the directness of it had no greater oddity than the\nfact that the young man’s way with the three travellers should have\nbeen so happy a manifestation. Strether liked him for it, on the spot,\nas he hadn’t yet liked him; it affected him while it lasted as he might\nhave been affected by some light pleasant perfect work of art: to that\ndegree that he wondered if they were really worthy of it, took it in\nand did it justice; to that degree that it would have been scarce a\nmiracle if, there in the luggage-room, while they waited for their\nthings, Sarah had pulled his sleeve and drawn him aside. “You’re right;\nwe haven’t quite known what you mean, Mother and I, but now we see.\nChad’s magnificent; what can one want more? If _this_ is the kind of\nthing—!” On which they might, as it were, have embraced and begun to\nwork together.\n\nAh how much, as it was, for all her bridling brightness—which was\nmerely general and noticed nothing—_would_ they work together? Strether\nknew he was unreasonable; he set it down to his being nervous: people\ncouldn’t notice everything and speak of everything in a quarter of an\nhour. Possibly, no doubt, also, he made too much of Chad’s display.\nYet, none the less, when, at the end of five minutes, in the cab, Jim\nPocock had said nothing either—hadn’t said, that is, what Strether\nwanted, though he had said much else—it all suddenly bounced back to\ntheir being either stupid or wilful. It was more probably on the whole\nthe former; so that that would be the drawback of the bridling\nbrightness. Yes, they would bridle and be bright; they would make the\nbest of what was before them, but their observation would fail; it\nwould be beyond them; they simply wouldn’t understand. Of what use\nwould it be then that they had come?—if they weren’t to be intelligent\nup to _that_ point: unless indeed he himself were utterly deluded and\nextravagant? Was he, on this question of Chad’s improvement, fantastic\nand away from the truth? Did he live in a false world, a world that had\ngrown simply to suit him, and was his present slight irritation—in the\nface now of Jim’s silence in particular—but the alarm of the vain thing\nmenaced by the touch of the real? Was this contribution of the real\npossibly the mission of the Pococks?—had they come to make the work of\nobservation, as _he_ had practised observation, crack and crumble, and\nto reduce Chad to the plain terms in which honest minds could deal with\nhim? Had they come in short to be sane where Strether was destined to\nfeel that he himself had only been silly?\n\nHe glanced at such a contingency, but it failed to hold him long when\nonce he had reflected that he would have been silly, in this case, with\nMaria Gostrey and little Bilham, with Madame de Vionnet and little\nJeanne, with Lambert Strether, in fine, and above all with Chad Newsome\nhimself. Wouldn’t it be found to have made more for reality to be silly\nwith these persons than sane with Sarah and Jim? Jim in fact, he\npresently made up his mind, was individually out of it; Jim didn’t\ncare; Jim hadn’t come out either for Chad or for him; Jim in short left\nthe moral side to Sally and indeed simply availed himself now, for the\nsense of recreation, of the fact that he left almost everything to\nSally. He was nothing compared to Sally, and not so much by reason of\nSally’s temper and will as by that of her more developed type and\ngreater acquaintance with the world. He quite frankly and serenely\nconfessed, as he sat there with Strether, that he felt his type hang\nfar in the rear of his wife’s and still further, if possible, in the\nrear of his sister’s. Their types, he well knew, were recognised and\nacclaimed; whereas the most a leading Woollett business-man could hope\nto achieve socially, and for that matter industrially, was a certain\nfreedom to play into this general glamour.\n\nThe impression he made on our friend was another of the things that\nmarked our friend’s road. It was a strange impression, especially as so\nsoon produced; Strether had received it, he judged, all in the twenty\nminutes; it struck him at least as but in a minor degree the work of\nthe long Woollett years. Pocock was normally and consentingly though\nnot quite wittingly out of the question. It was despite his being\nnormal; it was despite his being cheerful; it was despite his being a\nleading Woollett business-man; and the determination of his fate left\nhim thus perfectly usual—as everything else about it was clearly, to\nhis sense, not less so. He seemed to say that there was a whole side of\nlife on which the perfectly usual _was_ for leading Woollett\nbusiness-men to be out of the question. He made no more of it than\nthat, and Strether, so far as Jim was concerned, desired to make no\nmore. Only Strether’s imagination, as always, worked, and he asked\nhimself if this side of life were not somehow connected, for those who\nfigured on it with the fact of marriage. Would _his_ relation to it,\nhad he married ten years before, have become now the same as Pocock’s?\nMight it even become the same should he marry in a few months? Should\nhe ever know himself as much out of the question for Mrs. Newsome as\nJim knew himself—in a dim way—for Mrs. Jim?\n\nTo turn his eyes in that direction was to be personally reassured; he\nwas different from Pocock; he had affirmed himself differently and was\nheld after all in higher esteem. What none the less came home to him,\nhowever, at this hour, was that the society over there, that of which\nSarah and Mamie—and, in a more eminent way, Mrs. Newsome herself—were\nspecimens, was essentially a society of women, and that poor Jim wasn’t\nin it. He himself Lambert Strether, _was_ as yet in some degree—which\nwas an odd situation for a man; but it kept coming back to him in a\nwhimsical way that he should perhaps find his marriage had cost him his\nplace. This occasion indeed, whatever that fancy represented, was not a\ntime of sensible exclusion for Jim, who was in a state of manifest\nresponse to the charm of his adventure. Small and fat and constantly\nfacetious, straw-coloured and destitute of marks, he would have been\npractically indistinguishable hadn’t his constant preference for\nlight-grey clothes, for white hats, for very big cigars and very little\nstories, done what it could for his identity. There were signs in him,\nthough none of them plaintive, of always paying for others; and the\nprincipal one perhaps was just this failure of type. It was with this\nthat he paid, rather than with fatigue or waste; and also doubtless a\nlittle with the effort of humour—never irrelevant to the conditions, to\nthe relations, with which he was acquainted.\n\nHe gurgled his joy as they rolled through the happy streets; he\ndeclared that his trip was a regular windfall, and that he wasn’t\nthere, he was eager to remark, to hang back from anything: he didn’t\nknow quite what Sally had come for, but _he_ had come for a good time.\nStrether indulged him even while wondering if what Sally wanted her\nbrother to go back for was to become like her husband. He trusted that\na good time was to be, out and out, the programme for all of them; and\nhe assented liberally to Jim’s proposal that, disencumbered and\nirresponsible—his things were in the omnibus with those of the\nothers—they should take a further turn round before going to the hotel.\nIt wasn’t for _him_ to tackle Chad—it was Sally’s job; and as it would\nbe like her, he felt, to open fire on the spot, it wouldn’t be amiss of\nthem to hold off and give her time. Strether, on his side, only asked\nto give her time; so he jogged with his companion along boulevards and\navenues, trying to extract from meagre material some forecast of his\ncatastrophe. He was quick enough to see that Jim Pocock declined\njudgement, had hovered quite round the outer edge of discussion and\nanxiety, leaving all analysis of their question to the ladies alone and\nnow only feeling his way toward some small droll cynicism. It broke out\nafresh, the cynicism—it had already shown a flicker—in a but slightly\ndeferred: “Well, hanged if I would if _I_ were he!”\n\n“You mean you wouldn’t in Chad’s place—?”\n\n“Give up this to go back and boss the advertising!” Poor Jim, with his\narms folded and his little legs out in the open fiacre, drank in the\nsparkling Paris noon and carried his eyes from one side of their vista\nto the other. “Why I want to come right out and live here myself. And I\nwant to live while I _am_ here too. I feel with _you_—oh you’ve been\ngrand, old man, and I’ve twigged—that it ain’t right to worry Chad. _I_\ndon’t mean to persecute him; I couldn’t in conscience. It’s thanks to\nyou at any rate that I’m here, and I’m sure I’m much obliged. You’re a\nlovely pair.”\n\nThere were things in this speech that Strether let pass for the time.\n“Don’t you then think it important the advertising should be thoroughly\ntaken in hand? Chad _will_ be, so far as capacity is concerned,” he\nwent on, “the man to do it.”\n\n“Where did he get his capacity,” Jim asked, “over here?”\n\n“He didn’t get it over here, and the wonderful thing is that over here\nhe hasn’t inevitably lost it. He has a natural turn for business, an\nextraordinary head. He comes by that,” Strether explained, “honestly\nenough. He’s in that respect his father’s son, and also—for she’s\nwonderful in her way too—his mother’s. He has other tastes and other\ntendencies; but Mrs. Newsome and your wife are quite right about his\nhaving that. He’s very remarkable.”\n\n“Well, I guess he is!” Jim Pocock comfortably sighed. “But if you’ve\nbelieved so in his making us hum, why have you so prolonged the\ndiscussion? Don’t you know we’ve been quite anxious about you?”\n\nThese questions were not informed with earnestness, but Strether saw he\nmust none the less make a choice and take a line. “Because, you see,\nI’ve greatly liked it. I’ve liked my Paris, I dare say I’ve liked it\ntoo much.”\n\n“Oh you old wretch!” Jim gaily exclaimed.\n\n“But nothing’s concluded,” Strether went on. “The case is more complex\nthan it looks from Woollett.”\n\n“Oh well, it looks bad enough from Woollett!” Jim declared.\n\n“Even after all I’ve written?”\n\nJim bethought himself. “Isn’t it what you’ve written that has made Mrs.\nNewsome pack us off? That at least and Chad’s not turning up?”\n\nStrether made a reflexion of his own. “I see. That she should do\nsomething was, no doubt, inevitable, and your wife has therefore of\ncourse come out to act.”\n\n“Oh yes,” Jim concurred—“to act. But Sally comes out to act, you know,”\nhe lucidly added, “every time she leaves the house. She never comes out\nbut she _does_ act. She’s acting moreover now for her mother, and that\nfixes the scale.” Then he wound up, opening all his senses to it, with\na renewed embrace of pleasant Paris. “We haven’t all the same at\nWoollett got anything like this.”\n\nStrether continued to consider. “I’m bound to say for you all that you\nstrike me as having arrived in a very mild and reasonable frame of\nmind. You don’t show your claws. I felt just now in Mrs. Pocock no\nsymptom of that. She isn’t fierce,” he went on. “I’m such a nervous\nidiot that I thought she might be.”\n\n“Oh don’t you know her well enough,” Pocock asked, “to have noticed\nthat she never gives herself away, any more than her mother ever does?\nThey ain’t fierce, either of ‘em; they let you come quite close. They\nwear their fur the smooth side out—the warm side in. Do you know what\nthey are?” Jim pursued as he looked about him, giving the question, as\nStrether felt, but half his care—“do you know what they are? They’re\nabout as intense as they can live.”\n\n“Yes”—and Strether’s concurrence had a positive precipitation; “they’re\nabout as intense as they can live.”\n\n“They don’t lash about and shake the cage,” said Jim, who seemed\npleased with his analogy; “and it’s at feeding-time that they’re\nquietest. But they always get there.”\n\n“They do indeed—they always get there!” Strether replied with a laugh\nthat justified his confession of nervousness. He disliked to be talking\nsincerely of Mrs. Newsome with Pocock; he could have talked\ninsincerely. But there was something he wanted to know, a need created\nin him by her recent intermission, by his having given from the first\nso much, as now more than ever appeared to him, and got so little. It\nwas as if a queer truth in his companion’s metaphor had rolled over him\nwith a rush. She _had_ been quiet at feeding-time; she had fed, and\nSarah had fed with her, out of the big bowl of all his recent free\ncommunication, his vividness and pleasantness, his ingenuity and even\nhis eloquence, while the current of her response had steadily run thin.\nJim meanwhile however, it was true, slipped characteristically into\nshallowness from the moment he ceased to speak out of the experience of\na husband.\n\n“But of course Chad has now the advantage of being there before her. If\nhe doesn’t work that for all it’s worth—!” He sighed with contingent\npity at his brother-in-law’s possible want of resource. “He has worked\nit on _you_, pretty well, eh?” and he asked the next moment if there\nwere anything new at the Varieties, which he pronounced in the American\nmanner. They talked about the Varieties—Strether confessing to a\nknowledge which produced again on Pocock’s part a play of innuendo as\nvague as a nursery-rhyme, yet as aggressive as an elbow in his side;\nand they finished their drive under the protection of easy themes.\nStrether waited to the end, but still in vain, for any show that Jim\nhad seen Chad as different; and he could scarce have explained the\ndiscouragement he drew from the absence of this testimony. It was what\nhe had taken his own stand on, so far as he had taken a stand; and if\nthey were all only going to see nothing he had only wasted his time. He\ngave his friend till the very last moment, till they had come into\nsight of the hotel; and when poor Pocock only continued cheerful and\nenvious and funny he fairly grew to dislike him, to feel him\nextravagantly common. If they were _all_ going to see nothing!—Strether\nknew, as this came back to him, that he was also letting Pocock\nrepresent for him what Mrs. Newsome wouldn’t see. He went on disliking,\nin the light of Jim’s commonness, to talk to him about that lady; yet\njust before the cab pulled up he knew the extent of his desire for the\nreal word from Woollett.\n\n“Has Mrs. Newsome at all given way—?”\n\n“‘Given way’?”—Jim echoed it with the practical derision of his sense\nof a long past.\n\n“Under the strain, I mean, of hope deferred, of disappointment repeated\nand thereby intensified.”\n\n“Oh is she prostrate, you mean?”—he had his categories in hand. “Why\nyes, she’s prostrate—just as Sally is. But they’re never so lively, you\nknow, as when they’re prostrate.”\n\n“Ah Sarah’s prostrate?” Strether vaguely murmured.\n\n“It’s when they’re prostrate that they most sit up.”\n\n“And Mrs. Newsome’s sitting up?”\n\n“All night, my boy—for _you!_” And Jim fetched him, with a vulgar\nlittle guffaw, a thrust that gave relief to the picture. But he had got\nwhat he wanted. He felt on the spot that this _was_ the real word from\nWoollett. “So don’t you go home!” Jim added while he alighted and while\nhis friend, letting him profusely pay the cabman, sat on in a momentary\nmuse. Strether wondered if that were the real word too.\n\n\n III\n\nAs the door of Mrs. Pocock’s salon was pushed open for him, the next\nday, well before noon, he was reached by a voice with a charming sound\nthat made him just falter before crossing the threshold. Madame de\nVionnet was already on the field, and this gave the drama a quicker\npace than he felt it as yet—though his suspense had increased—in the\npower of any act of his own to do. He had spent the previous evening\nwith all his old friends together yet he would still have described\nhimself as quite in the dark in respect to a forecast of their\ninfluence on his situation. It was strange now, none the less, that in\nthe light of this unexpected note of her presence he felt Madame de\nVionnet a part of that situation as she hadn’t even yet been. She was\nalone, he found himself assuming, with Sarah, and there was a bearing\nin that—somehow beyond his control—on his personal fate. Yet she was\nonly saying something quite easy and independent—the thing she had\ncome, as a good friend of Chad’s, on purpose to say. “There isn’t\nanything at all—? I should be so delighted.”\n\nIt was clear enough, when they were there before him, how she had been\nreceived. He saw this, as Sarah got up to greet him, from something\nfairly hectic in Sarah’s face. He saw furthermore that they weren’t, as\nhad first come to him, alone together; he was at no loss as to the\nidentity of the broad high back presented to him in the embrasure of\nthe window furthest from the door. Waymarsh, whom he had to-day not yet\nseen, whom he only knew to have left the hotel before him, and who had\ntaken part, the night previous, on Mrs. Pocock’s kind invitation,\nconveyed by Chad, in the entertainment, informal but cordial, promptly\noffered by that lady—Waymarsh had anticipated him even as Madame de\nVionnet had done, and, with his hands in his pockets and his attitude\nunaffected by Strether’s entrance, was looking out, in marked\ndetachment, at the Rue de Rivoli. The latter felt it in the air—it was\nimmense how Waymarsh could mark things—-that he had remained deeply\ndissociated from the overture to their hostess that we have recorded on\nMadame de Vionnet’s side. He had, conspicuously, tact, besides a stiff\ngeneral view; and this was why he had left Mrs. Pocock to struggle\nalone. He would outstay the visitor; he would unmistakeably wait; to\nwhat had he been doomed for months past but waiting? Therefore she was\nto feel that she had him in reserve. What support she drew from this\nwas still to be seen, for, although Sarah was vividly bright, she had\ngiven herself up for the moment to an ambiguous flushed formalism. She\nhad had to reckon more quickly than she expected; but it concerned her\nfirst of all to signify that she was not to be taken unawares. Strether\narrived precisely in time for her showing it. “Oh you’re too good; but\nI don’t think I feel quite helpless. I have my brother—and these\nAmerican friends. And then you know I’ve been to Paris. I _know_\nParis,” said Sally Pocock in a tone that breathed a certain chill on\nStrether’s heart.\n\n“Ah but a woman, in this tiresome place where everything’s always\nchanging, a woman of good will,” Madame de Vionnet threw off, “can\nalways help a woman. I’m sure you ‘know’—but we know perhaps different\nthings.” She too, visibly, wished to make no mistake; but it was a fear\nof a different order and more kept out of sight. She smiled in welcome\nat Strether; she greeted him more familiarly than Mrs. Pocock; she put\nout her hand to him without moving from her place; and it came to him\nin the course of a minute and in the oddest way that—yes,\npositively—she was giving him over to ruin. She was all kindness and\nease, but she couldn’t help so giving him; she was exquisite, and her\nbeing just as she was poured for Sarah a sudden rush of meaning into\nhis own equivocations. How could she know how she was hurting him? She\nwanted to show as simple and humble—in the degree compatible with\noperative charm; but it was just this that seemed to put him on her\nside. She struck him as dressed, as arranged, as prepared infinitely to\nconciliate—with the very poetry of good taste in her view of the\nconditions of her early call. She was ready to advise about dressmakers\nand shops; she held herself wholly at the disposition of Chad’s family.\nStrether noticed her card on the table—her coronet and her\n“Comtesse”—and the imagination was sharp in him of certain private\nadjustments in Sarah’s mind. She had never, he was sure, sat with a\n“Comtesse” before, and such was the specimen of that class he had been\nkeeping to play on her. She had crossed the sea very particularly for a\nlook at her; but he read in Madame de Vionnet’s own eyes that this\ncuriosity hadn’t been so successfully met as that she herself wouldn’t\nnow have more than ever need of him. She looked much as she had looked\nto him that morning at Notre Dame; he noted in fact the suggestive\nsameness of her discreet and delicate dress. It seemed to speak—perhaps\na little prematurely or too finely—of the sense in which she would help\nMrs. Pocock with the shops. The way that lady took her in, moreover,\nadded depth to his impression of what Miss Gostrey, by their common\nwisdom, had escaped. He winced as he saw himself but for that timely\nprudence ushering in Maria as a guide and an example. There was however\na touch of relief for him in his glimpse, so far as he had got it, of\nSarah’s line. She “knew Paris.” Madame de Vionnet had, for that matter,\nlightly taken this up. “Ah then you’ve a turn for that, an affinity\nthat belongs to your family. Your brother, though his long experience\nmakes a difference, I admit, has become one of us in a marvellous way.”\nAnd she appealed to Strether in the manner of a woman who could always\nglide off with smoothness into another subject. Wasn’t _he_ struck with\nthe way Mr. Newsome had made the place his own, and hadn’t he been in a\nposition to profit by his friend’s wondrous expertness?\n\nStrether felt the bravery, at the least, of her presenting herself so\npromptly to sound that note, and yet asked himself what other note,\nafter all, she _could_ strike from the moment she presented herself at\nall. She could meet Mrs. Pocock only on the ground of the obvious, and\nwhat feature of Chad’s situation was more eminent than the fact that he\nhad created for himself a new set of circumstances? Unless she hid\nherself altogether she could show but as one of these, an illustration\nof his domiciled and indeed of his confirmed condition. And the\nconsciousness of all this in her charming eyes was so clear and fine\nthat as she thus publicly drew him into her boat she produced in him\nsuch a silent agitation as he was not to fail afterwards to denounce as\npusillanimous. “Ah don’t be so charming to me!—for it makes us\nintimate, and after all what _is_ between us when I’ve been so\ntremendously on my guard and have seen you but half a dozen times?” He\nrecognised once more the perverse law that so inveterately governed his\npoor personal aspects: it would be exactly _like_ the way things always\nturned out for him that he should affect Mrs. Pocock and Waymarsh as\nlaunched in a relation in which he had really never been launched at\nall. They were at this very moment—they could only be—attributing to\nhim the full licence of it, and all by the operation of her own tone\nwith him; whereas his sole licence had been to cling with intensity to\nthe brink, not to dip so much as a toe into the flood. But the flicker\nof his fear on this occasion was not, as may be added, to repeat\nitself; it sprang up, for its moment, only to die down and then go out\nfor ever. To meet his fellow visitor’s invocation and, with Sarah’s\nbrilliant eyes on him, answer, _was_ quite sufficiently to step into\nher boat. During the rest of the time her visit lasted he felt himself\nproceed to each of the proper offices, successively, for helping to\nkeep the adventurous skiff afloat. It rocked beneath him, but he\nsettled himself in his place. He took up an oar and, since he was to\nhave the credit of pulling, pulled.\n\n“That will make it all the pleasanter if it so happens that we _do_\nmeet,” Madame de Vionnet had further observed in reference to Mrs.\nPocock’s mention of her initiated state; and she had immediately added\nthat, after all, her hostess couldn’t be in need with the good offices\nof Mr. Strether so close at hand. “It’s he, I gather, who has learnt to\nknow his Paris, and to love it, better than any one ever before in so\nshort a time; so that between him and your brother, when it comes to\nthe point, how can you possibly want for good guidance? The great\nthing, Mr. Strether will show you,” she smiled, “is just to let one’s\nself go.”\n\n“Oh I’ve not let myself go very far,” Strether answered, feeling quite\nas if he had been called upon to hint to Mrs. Pocock how Parisians\ncould talk. “I’m only afraid of showing I haven’t let myself go far\nenough. I’ve taken a good deal of time, but I must quite have had the\nair of not budging from one spot.” He looked at Sarah in a manner that\nhe thought she might take as engaging, and he made, under Madame de\nVionnet’s protection, as it were, his first personal point. “What has\nreally happened has been that, all the while, I’ve done what I came out\nfor.”\n\nYet it only at first gave Madame de Vionnet a chance immediately to\ntake him up. “You’ve renewed acquaintance with your friend—you’ve\nlearnt to know him again.” She spoke with such cheerful helpfulness\nthat they might, in a common cause, have been calling together and\npledged to mutual aid.\n\nWaymarsh, at this, as if he had been in question, straightway turned\nfrom the window. “Oh yes, Countess—he has renewed acquaintance with\n_me_, and he _has_, I guess, learnt something about me, though I don’t\nknow how much he has liked it. It’s for Strether himself to say whether\nhe has felt it justifies his course.”\n\n“Oh but _you_,” said the Countess gaily, “are not in the least what he\ncame out for—is he really, Strether? and I hadn’t you at all in my\nmind. I was thinking of Mr. Newsome, of whom we think so much and with\nwhom, precisely, Mrs. Pocock has given herself the opportunity to take\nup threads. What a pleasure for you both!” Madame de Vionnet, with her\neyes on Sarah, bravely continued.\n\nMrs. Pocock met her handsomely, but Strether quickly saw she meant to\naccept no version of her movements or plans from any other lips. She\nrequired no patronage and no support, which were but other names for a\nfalse position; she would show in her own way what she chose to show,\nand this she expressed with a dry glitter that recalled to him a fine\nWoollett winter morning. “I’ve never wanted for opportunities to see my\nbrother. We’ve many things to think of at home, and great\nresponsibilities and occupations, and our home’s not an impossible\nplace. We’ve plenty of reasons,” Sarah continued a little piercingly,\n“for everything we do”—and in short she wouldn’t give herself the least\nlittle scrap away. But she added as one who was always bland and who\ncould afford a concession: “I’ve come because—well, because we do\ncome.”\n\n“Ah then fortunately!”—Madame de Vionnet breathed it to the air. Five\nminutes later they were on their feet for her to take leave, standing\ntogether in an affability that had succeeded in surviving a further\nexchange of remarks; only with the emphasised appearance on Waymarsh’s\npart of a tendency to revert, in a ruminating manner and as with an\ninstinctive or a precautionary lightening of his tread, to an open\nwindow and his point of vantage. The glazed and gilded room, all red\ndamask, ormolu, mirrors, clocks, looked south, and the shutters were\nbowed upon the summer morning; but the Tuileries garden and what was\nbeyond it, over which the whole place hung, were things visible through\ngaps; so that the far-spreading presence of Paris came up in coolness,\ndimness and invitation, in the twinkle of gilt-tipped palings, the\ncrunch of gravel, the click of hoofs, the crack of whips, things that\nsuggested some parade of the circus. “I think it probable,” said Mrs.\nPocock, “that I shall have the opportunity of going to my brother’s.\nI’ve no doubt it’s very pleasant indeed.” She spoke as to Strether, but\nher face was turned with an intensity of brightness to Madame de\nVionnet, and there was a moment during which, while she thus fronted\nher, our friend expected to hear her add: “I’m much obliged to you, I’m\nsure, for inviting me there.” He guessed that for five seconds these\nwords were on the point of coming; he heard them as clearly as if they\nhad been spoken; but he presently knew they had just failed—knew it by\na glance, quick and fine, from Madame de Vionnet, which told him that\nshe too had felt them in the air, but that the point had luckily not\nbeen made in any manner requiring notice. This left her free to reply\nonly to what had been said.\n\n“That the Boulevard Malesherbes may be common ground for us offers me\nthe best prospect I see for the pleasure of meeting you again.”\n\n“Oh I shall come to see you, since you’ve been so good”: and Mrs.\nPocock looked her invader well in the eyes. The flush in Sarah’s cheeks\nhad by this time settled to a small definite crimson spot that was not\nwithout its own bravery; she held her head a good deal up, and it came\nto Strether that of the two, at this moment, she was the one who most\ncarried out the idea of a Countess. He quite took in, however, that she\nwould really return her visitor’s civility: she wouldn’t report again\nat Woollett without at least so much producible history as that in her\npocket.\n\n“I want extremely to be able to show you my little daughter.” Madame de\nVionnet went on; “and I should have brought her with me if I hadn’t\nwished first to ask your leave. I was in hopes I should perhaps find\nMiss Pocock, of whose being with you I’ve heard from Mr. Newsome and\nwhose acquaintance I should so much like my child to make. If I have\nthe pleasure of seeing her and you do permit it I shall venture to ask\nher to be kind to Jeanne. Mr. Strether will tell you”—she beautifully\nkept it up—“that my poor girl is gentle and good and rather lonely.\nThey’ve made friends, he and she, ever so happily, and he doesn’t, I\nbelieve, think ill of her. As for Jeanne herself he has had the same\nsuccess with her that I know he has had here wherever he has turned.”\nShe seemed to ask him for permission to say these things, or seemed\nrather to take it, softly and happily, with the ease of intimacy, for\ngranted, and he had quite the consciousness now that not to meet her at\nany point more than halfway would be odiously, basely to abandon her.\nYes, he was _with_ her, and, opposed even in this covert, this\nsemi-safe fashion to those who were not, he felt, strangely and\nconfusedly, but excitedly, inspiringly, how much and how far. It was as\nif he had positively waited in suspense for something from her that\nwould let him in deeper, so that he might show her how he could take\nit. And what did in fact come as she drew out a little her farewell\nserved sufficiently the purpose. “As his success is a matter that I’m\nsure he’ll never mention for himself, I feel, you see, the less\nscruple; which it’s very good of me to say, you know, by the way,” she\nadded as she addressed herself to him; “considering how little direct\nadvantage I’ve gained from your triumphs with _me_. When does one ever\nsee you? I wait at home and I languish. You’ll have rendered me the\nservice, Mrs. Pocock, at least,” she wound up, “of giving me one of my\nmuch-too-rare glimpses of this gentleman.”\n\n“I certainly should be sorry to deprive you of anything that seems so\nmuch, as you describe it, your natural due. Mr. Strether and I are very\nold friends,” Sarah allowed, “but the privilege of his society isn’t a\nthing I shall quarrel about with any one.”\n\n“And yet, dear Sarah,” he freely broke in, “I feel, when I hear you say\nthat, that you don’t quite do justice to the important truth of the\nextent to which—as you’re also mine—I’m _your_ natural due. I should\nlike much better,” he laughed, “to see you fight for me.”\n\nShe met him, Mrs. Pocock, on this, with an arrest of speech—with a\ncertain breathlessness, as he immediately fancied, on the score of a\nfreedom for which she wasn’t quite prepared. It had flared up—for all\nthe harm he had intended by it—because, confoundedly, he didn’t want\nany more to be afraid about her than he wanted to be afraid about\nMadame de Vionnet. He had never, naturally, called her anything but\nSarah at home, and though he had perhaps never quite so markedly\ninvoked her as his “dear,” that was somehow partly because no occasion\nhad hitherto laid so effective a trap for it. But something admonished\nhim now that it was too late—unless indeed it were possibly too early;\nand that he at any rate shouldn’t have pleased Mrs. Pocock the more by\nit. “Well, Mr. Strether—!” she murmured with vagueness, yet with\nsharpness, while her crimson spot burned a trifle brighter and he was\naware that this must be for the present the limit of her response.\nMadame de Vionnet had already, however, come to his aid, and Waymarsh,\nas if for further participation, moved again back to them. It was true\nthat the aid rendered by Madame de Vionnet was questionable; it was a\nsign that, for all one might confess to with her, and for all she might\ncomplain of not enjoying, she could still insidiously show how much of\nthe material of conversation had accumulated between them.\n\n“The real truth is, you know, that you sacrifice one without mercy to\ndear old Maria. She leaves no room in your life for anybody else. Do\nyou know,” she enquired of Mrs. Pocock, “about dear old Maria? The\nworst is that Miss Gostrey is really a wonderful woman.”\n\n“Oh yes indeed,” Strether answered for her, “Mrs. Pocock knows about\nMiss Gostrey. Your mother, Sarah, must have told you about her; your\nmother knows everything,” he sturdily pursued. “And I cordially admit,”\nhe added with his conscious gaiety of courage, “that she’s as wonderful\na woman as you like.”\n\n“Ah it isn’t _I_ who ‘like,’ dear Mr. Strether, anything to do with the\nmatter!” Sarah Pocock promptly protested; “and I’m by no means sure I\nhave—from my mother or from any one else—a notion of whom you’re\ntalking about.”\n\n“Well, he won’t let you see her, you know,” Madame de Vionnet\nsympathetically threw in. “He never lets _me_—old friends as we are: I\nmean as I am with Maria. He reserves her for his best hours; keeps her\nconsummately to himself; only gives us others the crumbs of the feast.”\n\n“Well, Countess, _I’ve_ had some of the crumbs,” Waymarsh observed with\nweight and covering her with his large look; which led her to break in\nbefore he could go on.\n\n“_Comment donc_, he shares her with _you?_” she exclaimed in droll\nstupefaction. “Take care you don’t have, before you go much further,\nrather more of all _ces dames_ than you may know what to do with!”\n\nBut he only continued in his massive way. “I can post you about the\nlady, Mrs. Pocock, so far as you may care to hear. I’ve seen her quite\na number of times, and I was practically present when they made\nacquaintance. I’ve kept my eye on her right along, but I don’t know as\nthere’s any real harm in her.”\n\n“‘Harm’?” Madame de Vionnet quickly echoed. “Why she’s the dearest and\ncleverest of all the clever and dear.”\n\n“Well, you run her pretty close, Countess,” Waymarsh returned with\nspirit; “though there’s no doubt she’s pretty well up in things. She\nknows her way round Europe. Above all there’s no doubt she does love\nStrether.”\n\n“Ah but we all do that—we all love Strether: it isn’t a merit!” their\nfellow visitor laughed, keeping to her idea with a good conscience at\nwhich our friend was aware that he marvelled, though he trusted also\nfor it, as he met her exquisitely expressive eyes, to some later light.\n\nThe prime effect of her tone, however—and it was a truth which his own\neyes gave back to her in sad ironic play—could only be to make him feel\nthat, to say such things to a man in public, a woman must practically\nthink of him as ninety years old. He had turned awkwardly, responsively\nred, he knew, at her mention of Maria Gostrey; Sarah Pocock’s\npresence—the particular quality of it—had made this inevitable; and\nthen he had grown still redder in proportion as he hated to have shown\nanything at all. He felt indeed that he was showing much, as,\nuncomfortably and almost in pain, he offered up his redness to\nWaymarsh, who, strangely enough, seemed now to be looking at him with a\ncertain explanatory yearning. Something deep—something built on their\nold old relation—passed, in this complexity, between them; he got the\nside-wind of a loyalty that stood behind all actual queer questions.\nWaymarsh’s dry bare humour—as it gave itself to be taken—gloomed out to\ndemand justice. “Well, if you talk of Miss Barrace I’ve _my_ chance\ntoo,” it appeared stiffly to nod, and it granted that it was giving him\naway, but struggled to add that it did so only to save him. The sombre\nglow stared it at him till it fairly sounded out—“to save you, poor old\nman, to save you; to save you in spite of yourself.” Yet it was somehow\njust this communication that showed him to himself as more than ever\nlost. Still another result of it was to put before him as never yet\nthat between his comrade and the interest represented by Sarah there\nwas already a basis. Beyond all question now, yes: Waymarsh had been in\noccult relation with Mrs. Newsome—out, out it all came in the very\neffort of his face. “Yes, you’re feeling my hand”—he as good as\nproclaimed it; “but only because this at least I _shall_ have got out\nof the damned Old World: that I shall have picked up the pieces into\nwhich it has caused you to crumble.” It was as if in short, after an\ninstant, Strether had not only had it from him, but had recognised that\nso far as this went the instant had cleared the air. Our friend\nunderstood and approved; he had the sense that they wouldn’t otherwise\nspeak of it. This would be all, and it would mark in himself a kind of\nintelligent generosity. It was with grim Sarah then—Sarah grim for all\nher grace—that Waymarsh had begun at ten o’clock in the morning to save\nhim. Well—if he _could_, poor dear man, with his big bleak kindness!\nThe upshot of which crowded perception was that Strether, on his own\nside, still showed no more than he absolutely had to. He showed the\nleast possible by saying to Mrs. Pocock after an interval much briefer\nthan our glance at the picture reflected in him: “Oh it’s as true as\nthey please!—There’s no Miss Gostrey for any one but me—not the least\nlittle peep. I keep her to myself.”\n\n“Well, it’s very good of you to notify me,” Sarah replied without\nlooking at him and thrown for a moment by this discrimination, as the\ndirection of her eyes showed, upon a dimly desperate little community\nwith Madame de Vionnet. “But I hope I shan’t miss her too much.”\n\nMadame de Vionnet instantly rallied. “And you know—though it might\noccur to one—it isn’t in the least that he’s ashamed of her. She’s\nreally—in a way—extremely good-looking.”\n\n“Ah but extremely!” Strether laughed while he wondered at the odd part\nhe found thus imposed on him.\n\nIt continued to be so by every touch from Madame de Vionnet. “Well, as\nI say, you know, I wish you would keep _me_ a little more to yourself.\nCouldn’t you name some day for me, some hour—and better soon than late?\nI’ll be at home whenever it best suits you. There—I can’t say fairer.”\n\nStrether thought a moment while Waymarsh and Mrs. Pocock affected him\nas standing attentive. “I did lately call on you. Last week—while Chad\nwas out of town.”\n\n“Yes—and I was away, as it happened, too. You choose your moments well.\nBut don’t wait for my next absence, for I shan’t make another,” Madame\nde Vionnet declared, “while Mrs. Pocock’s here.”\n\n“That vow needn’t keep you long, fortunately,” Sarah observed with\nreasserted suavity. “I shall be at present but a short time in Paris. I\nhave my plans for other countries. I meet a number of charming\nfriends”—and her voice seemed to caress that description of these\npersons.\n\n“Ah then,” her visitor cheerfully replied, “all the more reason!\nTo-morrow, for instance, or next day?” she continued to Strether.\n“Tuesday would do for me beautifully.”\n\n“Tuesday then with pleasure.”\n\n“And at half-past five?—or at six?”\n\nIt was ridiculous, but Mrs. Pocock and Waymarsh struck him as fairly\nwaiting for his answer. It was indeed as if they were arranged,\ngathered for a performance, the performance of “Europe” by his\nconfederate and himself. Well, the performance could only go on. “Say\nfive forty-five.”\n\n“Five forty-five—good.” And now at last Madame de Vionnet must leave\nthem, though it carried, for herself, the performance a little further.\n“I _did_ hope so much also to see Miss Pocock. Mayn’t I still?”\n\nSarah hesitated, but she rose equal. “She’ll return your visit with me.\nShe’s at present out with Mr. Pocock and my brother.”\n\n“I see—of course Mr. Newsome has everything to show them. He has told\nme so much about her. My great desire’s to give my daughter the\nopportunity of making her acquaintance. I’m always on the lookout for\nsuch chances for her. If I didn’t bring her to-day it was only to make\nsure first that you’d let me.” After which the charming woman risked a\nmore intense appeal. “It wouldn’t suit _you_ also to mention some near\ntime, so that we shall be sure not to lose you?” Strether on his side\nwaited, for Sarah likewise had, after all, to perform; and it occupied\nhim to have been thus reminded that she had stayed at home—and on her\nfirst morning of Paris—while Chad led the others forth. Oh she was up\nto her eyes; if she had stayed at home she had stayed by an\nunderstanding, arrived at the evening before, that Waymarsh would come\nand find her alone. This was beginning well—for a first day in Paris;\nand the thing might be amusing yet. But Madame de Vionnet’s earnestness\nwas meanwhile beautiful. “You may think me indiscreet, but I’ve _such_\na desire my Jeanne shall know an American girl of the really delightful\nkind. You see I throw myself for it on your charity.”\n\nThe manner of this speech gave Strether such a sense of depths below it\nand behind it as he hadn’t yet had—ministered in a way that almost\nfrightened him to his dim divinations of reasons; but if Sarah still,\nin spite of it, faltered, this was why he had time for a sign of\nsympathy with her petitioner. “Let me say then, dear lady, to back your\nplea, that Miss Mamie is of the most delightful kind of all—is charming\namong the charming.”\n\nEven Waymarsh, though with more to produce on the subject, could get\ninto motion in time. “Yes, Countess, the American girl’s a thing that\nyour country must at least allow ours the privilege to say we _can_\nshow you. But her full beauty is only for those who know how to make\nuse of her.”\n\n“Ah then,” smiled Madame de Vionnet, “that’s exactly what I want to do.\nI’m sure she has much to teach us.”\n\nIt was wonderful, but what was scarce less so was that Strether found\nhimself, by the quick effect of it, moved another way. “Oh that may be!\nBut don’t speak of your own exquisite daughter, you know, as if she\nweren’t pure perfection. _I_ at least won’t take that from you.\nMademoiselle de Vionnet,” he explained, in considerable form, to Mrs.\nPocock, “_is_ pure perfection. Mademoiselle de Vionnet _is_ exquisite.”\n\nIt had been perhaps a little portentous, but “Ah?” Sarah simply\nglittered.\n\nWaymarsh himself, for that matter, apparently recognised, in respect to\nthe facts, the need of a larger justice, and he had with it an\ninclination to Sarah. “Miss Jane’s strikingly handsome—in the regular\nFrench style.”\n\nIt somehow made both Strether and Madame de Vionnet laugh out, though\nat the very moment he caught in Sarah’s eyes, as glancing at the\nspeaker, a vague but unmistakeable “You too?” It made Waymarsh in fact\nlook consciously over her head. Madame de Vionnet meanwhile, however,\nmade her point in her own way. “I wish indeed I could offer you my poor\nchild as a dazzling attraction: it would make one’s position simple\nenough! She’s as good as she can be, but of course she’s different, and\nthe question is now—in the light of the way things seem to go—if she\nisn’t after all _too_ different: too different I mean from the splendid\ntype every one is so agreed that your wonderful country produces. On\nthe other hand of course Mr. Newsome, who knows it so well, has, as a\ngood friend, dear kind man that he is, done everything he can—to keep\nus from fatal benightedness—for my small shy creature. Well,” she wound\nup after Mrs. Pocock had signified, in a murmur still a little stiff,\nthat she would speak to her own young charge on the question—“well, we\nshall sit, my child and I, and wait and wait and wait for you.” But her\nlast fine turn was for Strether. “Do speak of us in such a way—!”\n\n“As that something can’t but come of it? Oh something _shall_ come of\nit! I take a great interest!” he further declared; and in proof of it,\nthe next moment, he had gone with her down to her carriage.\n\n\nBook Ninth\n\n\n I\n\n“The difficulty is,” Strether said to Madame de Vionnet a couple of\ndays later, “that I can’t surprise them into the smallest sign of his\nnot being the same old Chad they’ve been for the last three years\nglowering at across the sea. They simply won’t give any, and as a\npolicy, you know—what you call a _parti pris_, a deep game—that’s\npositively remarkable.”\n\nIt was so remarkable that our friend had pulled up before his hostess\nwith the vision of it; he had risen from his chair at the end of ten\nminutes and begun, as a help not to worry, to move about before her\nquite as he moved before Maria. He had kept his appointment with her to\nthe minute and had been intensely impatient, though divided in truth\nbetween the sense of having everything to tell her and the sense of\nhaving nothing at all. The short interval had, in the face of their\ncomplication, multiplied his impressions—it being meanwhile to be\nnoted, moreover, that he already frankly, already almost publicly,\nviewed the complication as common to them. If Madame de Vionnet, under\nSarah’s eyes, had pulled him into her boat, there was by this time no\ndoubt whatever that he had remained in it and that what he had really\nmost been conscious of for many hours together was the movement of the\nvessel itself. They were in it together this moment as they hadn’t yet\nbeen, and he hadn’t at present uttered the least of the words of alarm\nor remonstrance that had died on his lips at the hotel. He had other\nthings to say to her than that she had put him in a position; so\nquickly had his position grown to affect him as quite excitingly,\naltogether richly, inevitable. That the outlook, however—given the\npoint of exposure—hadn’t cleared up half so much as he had reckoned was\nthe first warning she received from him on his arrival. She had replied\nwith indulgence that he was in too great a hurry, and had remarked\nsoothingly that if she knew how to be patient surely _he_ might be. He\nfelt her presence, on the spot, he felt her tone and everything about\nher, as an aid to that effort; and it was perhaps one of the proofs of\nher success with him that he seemed so much to take his ease while they\ntalked. By the time he had explained to her why his impressions, though\nmultiplied, still baffled him, it was as if he had been familiarly\ntalking for hours. They baffled him because Sarah—well, Sarah was deep,\ndeeper than she had ever yet had a chance to show herself. He didn’t\nsay that this was partly the effect of her opening so straight down, as\nit were, into her mother, and that, given Mrs. Newsome’s profundity,\nthe shaft thus sunk might well have a reach; but he wasn’t without a\nresigned apprehension that, at such a rate of confidence between the\ntwo women, he was likely soon to be moved to show how already, at\nmoments, it had been for him as if he were dealing directly with Mrs.\nNewsome. Sarah, to a certainty, would have begun herself to feel it in\nhim—and this naturally put it in her power to torment him the more.\nFrom the moment she knew he _could_ be tormented—!\n\n“But _why_ can you be?”—his companion was surprised at his use of the\nword.\n\n“Because I’m made so—I think of everything.”\n\n“Ah one must never do that,” she smiled. “One must think of as few\nthings as possible.”\n\n“Then,” he answered, “one must pick them out right. But all I mean\nis—for I express myself with violence—that she’s in a position to watch\nme. There’s an element of suspense for me, and she can see me wriggle.\nBut my wriggling doesn’t matter,” he pursued. “I can bear it. Besides,\nI shall wriggle out.”\n\nThe picture at any rate stirred in her an appreciation that he felt to\nbe sincere. “I don’t see how a man can be kinder to a woman than you\nare to me.”\n\nWell, kind was what he wanted to be; yet even while her charming eyes\nrested on him with the truth of this he none the less had his humour of\nhonesty. “When I say suspense I mean, you know,” he laughed, “suspense\nabout my own case too!”\n\n“Oh yes—about your own case too!” It diminished his magnanimity, but\nshe only looked at him the more tenderly.\n\n“Not, however,” he went on, “that I want to talk to you about that.\nIt’s my own little affair, and I mentioned it simply as part of Mrs.\nPocock’s advantage.” No, no; though there was a queer present\ntemptation in it, and his suspense was so real that to fidget was a\nrelief, he wouldn’t talk to her about Mrs. Newsome, wouldn’t work off\non her the anxiety produced in him by Sarah’s calculated omissions of\nreference. The effect she produced of representing her mother had been\nproduced—and that was just the immense, the uncanny part of it—without\nher having so much as mentioned that lady. She had brought no message,\nhad alluded to no question, had only answered his enquiries with\nhopeless limited propriety. She had invented a way of meeting them—as\nif he had been a polite perfunctory poor relation, of distant\ndegree—that made them almost ridiculous in him. He couldn’t moreover on\nhis own side ask much without appearing to publish how he had lately\nlacked news; a circumstance of which it was Sarah’s profound policy not\nto betray a suspicion. These things, all the same, he wouldn’t breathe\nto Madame de Vionnet—much as they might make him walk up and down. And\nwhat he didn’t say—as well as what _she_ didn’t, for she had also her\nhigh decencies—enhanced the effect of his being there with her at the\nend of ten minutes more intimately on the basis of saving her than he\nhad yet had occasion to be. It ended in fact by being quite beautiful\nbetween them, the number of things they had a manifest consciousness of\nnot saying. He would have liked to turn her, critically, to the subject\nof Mrs. Pocock, but he so stuck to the line he felt to be the point of\nhonour and of delicacy that he scarce even asked her what her personal\nimpression had been. He knew it, for that matter, without putting her\nto trouble: that she wondered how, with such elements, Sarah could\nstill have no charm, was one of the principal things she held her\ntongue about. Strether would have been interested in her estimate of\nthe elements—indubitably there, some of them, and to be appraised\naccording to taste—but he denied himself even the luxury of this\ndiversion. The way Madame de Vionnet affected him to-day was in itself\na kind of demonstration of the happy employment of gifts. How could a\nwoman think Sarah had charm who struck one as having arrived at it\nherself by such different roads? On the other hand of course Sarah\nwasn’t obliged to have it. He felt as if somehow Madame de Vionnet\n_was_. The great question meanwhile was what Chad thought of his\nsister; which was naturally ushered in by that of Sarah’s apprehension\nof Chad. _That_ they could talk of, and with a freedom purchased by\ntheir discretion in other senses. The difficulty however was that they\nwere reduced as yet to conjecture. He had given them in the day or two\nas little of a lead as Sarah, and Madame de Vionnet mentioned that she\nhadn’t seen him since his sister’s arrival.\n\n“And does that strike you as such an age?”\n\nShe met it in all honesty. “Oh I won’t pretend I don’t miss him.\nSometimes I see him every day. Our friendship’s like that. Make what\nyou will of it!” she whimsically smiled; a little flicker of the kind,\noccasional in her, that had more than once moved him to wonder what he\nmight best make of _her_. “But he’s perfectly right,” she hastened to\nadd, “and I wouldn’t have him fail in any way at present for the world.\nI’d sooner not see him for three months. I begged him to be beautiful\nto them, and he fully feels it for himself.”\n\nStrether turned away under his quick perception; she was so odd a\nmixture of lucidity and mystery. She fell in at moments with the theory\nabout her he most cherished, and she seemed at others to blow it into\nair. She spoke now as if her art were all an innocence, and then again\nas if her innocence were all an art. “Oh he’s giving himself up, and\nhe’ll do so to the end. How can he but want, now that it’s within\nreach, his full impression?—which is much more important, you know,\nthan either yours or mine. But he’s just soaking,” Strether said as he\ncame back; “he’s going in conscientiously for a saturation. I’m bound\nto say he _is_ very good.”\n\n“Ah,” she quietly replied, “to whom do you say it?” And then more\nquietly still: “He’s capable of anything.”\n\nStrether more than reaffirmed—“Oh he’s excellent. I more and more\nlike,” he insisted, “to see him with them;” though the oddity of this\ntone between them grew sharper for him even while they spoke. It placed\nthe young man so before them as the result of her interest and the\nproduct of her genius, acknowledged so her part in the phenomenon and\nmade the phenomenon so rare, that more than ever yet he might have been\non the very point of asking her for some more detailed account of the\nwhole business than he had yet received from her. The occasion almost\nforced upon him some question as to how she had managed and as to the\nappearance such miracles presented from her own singularly close place\nof survey. The moment in fact however passed, giving way to more\npresent history, and he continued simply to mark his appreciation of\nthe happy truth. “It’s a tremendous comfort to feel how one can trust\nhim.” And then again while for a little she said nothing—as if after\nall to _her_ trust there might be a special limit: “I mean for making a\ngood show to them.”\n\n“Yes,” she thoughtfully returned—“but if they shut their eyes to it!”\n\nStrether for an instant had his own thought. “Well perhaps that won’t\nmatter!”\n\n“You mean because he probably—do what they will—won’t like them?”\n\n“Oh ‘do what they will’—! They won’t do much; especially if Sarah\nhasn’t more—well, more than one has yet made out—to give.”\n\nMadame de Vionnet weighed it. “Ah she has all her grace!” It was a\nstatement over which, for a little, they could look at each other\nsufficiently straight, and though it produced no protest from Strether\nthe effect was somehow as if he had treated it as a joke. “She may be\npersuasive and caressing with him; she may be eloquent beyond words.\nShe may get hold of him,” she wound up—“well, as neither you nor I\nhave.”\n\n“Yes, she _may_”—and now Strether smiled. “But he has spent all his\ntime each day with Jim. He’s still showing Jim round.”\n\nShe visibly wondered. “Then how about Jim?”\n\nStrether took a turn before he answered. “Hasn’t he given you Jim?\nHasn’t he before this ‘done’ him for you?” He was a little at a loss.\n“Doesn’t he tell you things?”\n\nShe hesitated. “No”—and their eyes once more gave and took. “Not as you\ndo. You somehow make me see them—or at least feel them. And I haven’t\nasked too much,” she added; “I’ve of late wanted so not to worry him.”\n\n“Ah for that, so have I,” he said with encouraging assent; so that—as\nif she had answered everything—they were briefly sociable on it. It\nthrew him back on his other thought, with which he took another turn;\nstopping again, however, presently with something of a glow. “You see\nJim’s really immense. I think it will be Jim who’ll do it.”\n\nShe wondered. “Get hold of him?”\n\n“No—just the other thing. Counteract Sarah’s spell.” And he showed now,\nour friend, how far he had worked it out. “Jim’s intensely cynical.”\n\n“Oh dear Jim!” Madame de Vionnet vaguely smiled.\n\n“Yes, literally—dear Jim! He’s awful. What _he_ wants, heaven forgive\nhim, is to help us.”\n\n“You mean”—she was eager—“help _me?_”\n\n“Well, Chad and me in the first place. But he throws you in too, though\nwithout as yet seeing you much. Only, so far as he does see you—if you\ndon’t mind—he sees you as awful.”\n\n“‘Awful’?”—she wanted it all.\n\n“A regular bad one—though of course of a tremendously superior kind.\nDreadful, delightful, irresistible.”\n\n“Ah dear Jim! I should like to know him. I _must_.”\n\n“Yes, naturally. But will it do? You may, you know,” Strether\nsuggested, “disappoint him.”\n\nShe was droll and humble about it. “I can but try. But my wickedness\nthen,” she went on, “is my recommendation for him?”\n\n“Your wickedness and the charms with which, in such a degree as yours,\nhe associates it. He understands, you see, that Chad and I have above\nall wanted to have a good time, and his view is simple and sharp.\nNothing will persuade him—in the light, that is, of my behaviour—that I\nreally didn’t, quite as much as Chad, come over to have one before it\nwas too late. He wouldn’t have expected it of me; but men of my age, at\nWoollett—and especially the least likely ones—have been noted as liable\nto strange outbreaks, belated uncanny clutches at the unusual, the\nideal. It’s an effect that a lifetime of Woollett has quite been\nobserved as having; and I thus give it to you, in Jim’s view, for what\nit’s worth. Now his wife and his mother-in-law,” Strether continued to\nexplain, “have, as in honour bound, no patience with such phenomena,\nlate or early—which puts Jim, as against his relatives, on the other\nside. Besides,” he added, “I don’t think he really wants Chad back. If\nChad doesn’t come—”\n\n“He’ll have”—Madame de Vionnet quite apprehended—“more of the free\nhand?”\n\n“Well, Chad’s the bigger man.”\n\n“So he’ll work now, _en dessous_, to keep him quiet?”\n\n“No—he won’t ‘work’ at all, and he won’t do anything _en dessous_. He’s\nvery decent and won’t be a traitor in the camp. But he’ll be amused\nwith his own little view of our duplicity, he’ll sniff up what he\nsupposes to be Paris from morning till night, and he’ll be, as to the\nrest, for Chad—well, just what he is.”\n\nShe thought it over. “A warning?”\n\nHe met it almost with glee. “You _are_ as wonderful as everybody says!”\nAnd then to explain all he meant: “I drove him about for his first\nhour, and do you know what—all beautifully unconscious—he most put\nbefore me? Why that something like _that_ is at bottom, as an\nimprovement to his present state, as in fact the real redemption of it,\nwhat they think it may not be too late to make of our friend.” With\nwhich, as, taking it in, she seemed, in her recurrent alarm, bravely to\ngaze at the possibility, he completed his statement. “But it _is_ too\nlate. Thanks to you!”\n\nIt drew from her again one of her indefinite reflexions. “Oh ‘me’—after\nall!”\n\nHe stood before her so exhilarated by his demonstration that he could\nfairly be jocular. “Everything’s comparative. You’re better than\n_that_.”\n\n“You”—she could but answer him—“are better than anything.” But she had\nanother thought. “_Will_ Mrs. Pocock come to me?”\n\n“Oh yes—she’ll do that. As soon, that is, as my friend Waymarsh—_her_\nfriend now—leaves her leisure.”\n\nShe showed an interest. “Is he so much her friend as that?”\n\n“Why, didn’t you see it all at the hotel?”\n\n“Oh”—she was amused—“‘all’ is a good deal to say. I don’t know—I\nforget. I lost myself in _her_.”\n\n“You were splendid,” Strether returned—“but ‘all’ isn’t a good deal to\nsay: it’s only a little. Yet it’s charming so far as it goes. She wants\na man to herself.”\n\n“And hasn’t she got _you?_”\n\n“Do you think she looked at me—or even at you—as if she had?” Strether\neasily dismissed that irony. “Every one, you see, must strike her as\nhaving somebody. You’ve got Chad—and Chad has got you.”\n\n“I see”—she made of it what she could. “And you’ve got Maria.”\n\nWell, he on his side accepted that. “I’ve got Maria. And Maria has got\nme. So it goes.”\n\n“But Mr. Jim—whom has he got?”\n\n“Oh he has got—or it’s as _if_ he had—the whole place.”\n\n“But for Mr. Waymarsh”—she recalled—“isn’t Miss Barrace before any one\nelse?”\n\nHe shook his head. “Miss Barrace is a _raffinée_, and her amusement\nwon’t lose by Mrs. Pocock. It will gain rather—especially if Sarah\ntriumphs and she comes in for a view of it.”\n\n“How well you know us!” Madame de Vionnet, at this, frankly sighed.\n\n“No—it seems to me it’s we that I know. I know Sarah—it’s perhaps on\nthat ground only that my feet are firm. Waymarsh will take her round\nwhile Chad takes Jim—and I shall be, I assure you, delighted for both\nof them. Sarah will have had what she requires—she will have paid her\ntribute to the ideal; and he will have done about the same. In Paris\nit’s in the air—so what can one do less? If there’s a point that,\nbeyond any other, Sarah wants to make, it’s that she didn’t come out to\nbe narrow. We shall feel at least that.”\n\n“Oh,” she sighed, “the quantity we seem likely to ‘feel’! But what\nbecomes, in these conditions, of the girl?”\n\n“Of Mamie—if we’re all provided? Ah for that,” said Strether, “you can\ntrust Chad.”\n\n“To be, you mean, all right to her?”\n\n“To pay her every attention as soon as he has polished off Jim. He\nwants what Jim can give him—and what Jim really won’t—though he has had\nit all, and more than all, from me. He wants in short his own personal\nimpression, and he’ll get it—strong. But as soon as he has got it Mamie\nwon’t suffer.”\n\n“Oh Mamie mustn’t _suffer!_” Madame de Vionnet soothingly emphasised.\n\nBut Strether could reassure her. “Don’t fear. As soon as he has done\nwith Jim, Jim will fall to me. And then you’ll see.”\n\nIt was as if in a moment she saw already; yet she still waited. Then\n“Is she really quite charming?” she asked.\n\nHe had got up with his last words and gathered in his hat and gloves.\n“I don’t know; I’m watching. I’m studying the case, as it were—and I\ndare say I shall be able to tell you.”\n\nShe wondered. “Is it a case?”\n\n“Yes—I think so. At any rate I shall see.’\n\n“But haven’t you known her before?”\n\n“Yes,” he smiled—“but somehow at home she wasn’t a case. She has become\none since.” It was as if he made it out for himself. “She has become\none here.”\n\n“So very very soon?”\n\nHe measured it, laughing. “Not sooner than I did.”\n\n“And you became one—?”\n\n“Very very soon. The day I arrived.”\n\nHer intelligent eyes showed her thought of it. “Ah but the day you\narrived you met Maria. Whom has Miss Pocock met?”\n\nHe paused again, but he brought it out. “Hasn’t she met Chad?”\n\n“Certainly—but not for the first time. He’s an old friend.” At which\nStrether had a slow amused significant headshake that made her go on:\n“You mean that for _her_ at least he’s a new person—that she sees him\nas different?”\n\n“She sees him as different.”\n\n“And how does she see him?”\n\nStrether gave it up. “How can one tell how a deep little girl sees a\ndeep young man?”\n\n“Is every one so deep? Is she too?”\n\n“So it strikes me deeper than I thought. But wait a little—between us\nwe’ll make it out. You’ll judge for that matter yourself.”\n\nMadame de Vionnet looked for the moment fairly bent on the chance.\n“Then she _will_ come with her?—I mean Mamie with Mrs. Pocock?”\n\n“Certainly. Her curiosity, if nothing else, will in any case work that.\nBut leave it all to Chad.”\n\n“Ah,” wailed Madame de Vionnet, turning away a little wearily, “the\nthings I leave to Chad!”\n\nThe tone of it made him look at her with a kindness that showed his\nvision of her suspense. But he fell back on his confidence. “Oh\nwell—trust him. Trust him all the way.” He had indeed no sooner so\nspoken than the queer displacement of his point of view appeared again\nto come up for him in the very sound, which drew from him a short\nlaugh, immediately checked. He became still more advisory. “When they\ndo come give them plenty of Miss Jeanne. Let Mamie see her well.”\n\nShe looked for a moment as if she placed them face to face. “For Mamie\nto hate her?”\n\nHe had another of his corrective headshakes. “Mamie won’t. Trust\n_them_.”\n\nShe looked at him hard, and then as if it were what she must always\ncome back to: “It’s _you_ I trust. But I was sincere,” she said, “at\nthe hotel. I did, I do, want my child—”\n\n“Well?”—Strether waited with deference while she appeared to hesitate\nas to how to put it.\n\n“Well, to do what she can for me.”\n\nStrether for a little met her eyes on it; after which something that\nmight have been unexpected to her came from him. “Poor little duck!”\n\nNot more expected for himself indeed might well have been her echo of\nit. “Poor little duck! But she immensely wants herself,” she said, “to\nsee our friend’s cousin.”\n\n“Is that what she thinks her?”\n\n“It’s what we call the young lady.”\n\nHe thought again; then with a laugh: “Well, your daughter will help\nyou.”\n\nAnd now at last he took leave of her, as he had been intending for five\nminutes. But she went part of the way with him, accompanying him out of\nthe room and into the next and the next. Her noble old apartment\noffered a succession of three, the first two of which indeed, on\nentering, smaller than the last, but each with its faded and formal\nair, enlarged the office of the antechamber and enriched the sense of\napproach. Strether fancied them, liked them, and, passing through them\nwith her more slowly now, met a sharp renewal of his original\nimpression. He stopped, he looked back; the whole thing made a vista,\nwhich he found high melancholy and sweet—full, once more, of dim\nhistoric shades, of the faint faraway cannon-roar of the great Empire.\nIt was doubtless half the projection of his mind, but his mind was a\nthing that, among old waxed parquets, pale shades of pink and green,\npseudo-classic candelabra, he had always needfully to reckon with. They\ncould easily make him irrelevant. The oddity, the originality, the\npoetry—he didn’t know what to call it—of Chad’s connexion reaffirmed\nfor him its romantic side. “They ought to see this, you know. They\n_must_.”\n\n“The Pococks?”—she looked about in deprecation; she seemed to see gaps\nhe didn’t.\n\n“Mamie and Sarah—Mamie in particular.”\n\n“My shabby old place? But _their_ things—!”\n\n“Oh their things! You were talking of what will do something for you—”\n\n“So that it strikes you,” she broke in, “that my poor place may? Oh,”\nshe ruefully mused, “that _would_ be desperate!”\n\n“Do you know what I wish?” he went on. “I wish Mrs. Newsome herself\ncould have a look.”\n\nShe stared, missing a little his logic. “It would make a difference?”\n\nHer tone was so earnest that as he continued to look about he laughed.\n“It might!”\n\n“But you’ve told her, you tell me—”\n\n“All about you? Yes, a wonderful story. But there’s all the\nindescribable—what one gets only on the spot.”\n\n“Thank you!” she charmingly and sadly smiled.\n\n“It’s all about me here,” he freely continued. “Mrs. Newsome feels\nthings.”\n\nBut she seemed doomed always to come back to doubt. “No one feels so\nmuch as _you_. No—not any one.”\n\n“So much the worse then for every one. It’s very easy.”\n\nThey were by this time in the antechamber, still alone together, as she\nhadn’t rung for a servant. The antechamber was high and square, grave\nand suggestive too, a little cold and slippery even in summer, and with\na few old prints that were precious, Strether divined, on the walls. He\nstood in the middle, slightly lingering, vaguely directing his glasses,\nwhile, leaning against the door-post of the room, she gently pressed\nher cheek to the side of the recess. “_You_ would have been a friend.”\n\n“I?”—it startled him a little.\n\n“For the reason you say. You’re not stupid.” And then abruptly, as if\nbringing it out were somehow founded on that fact: “We’re marrying\nJeanne.”\n\nIt affected him on the spot as a move in a game, and he was even then\nnot without the sense that that wasn’t the way Jeanne should be\nmarried. But he quickly showed his interest, though—as quickly\nafterwards struck him—with an absurd confusion of mind. “‘You’? You\nand—a—not Chad?” Of course it was the child’s father who made the ‘we,’\nbut to the child’s father it would have cost him an effort to allude.\nYet didn’t it seem the next minute that Monsieur de Vionnet was after\nall not in question?—since she had gone on to say that it was indeed to\nChad she referred and that he had been in the whole matter kindness\nitself.\n\n“If I must tell you all, it is he himself who has put us in the way. I\nmean in the way of an opportunity that, so far as I can yet see, is all\nI could possibly have dreamed of. For all the trouble Monsieur de\nVionnet will ever take!” It was the first time she had spoken to him of\nher husband, and he couldn’t have expressed how much more intimate with\nher it suddenly made him feel. It wasn’t much, in truth—there were\nother things in what she was saying that were far more; but it was as\nif, while they stood there together so easily in these cold chambers of\nthe past, the single touch had shown the reach of her confidence. “But\nour friend,” she asked, “hasn’t then told you?”\n\n“He has told me nothing.”\n\n“Well, it has come with rather a rush—all in a very few days; and\nhasn’t moreover yet taken a form that permits an announcement. It’s\nonly for you—absolutely you alone—that I speak; I so want you to know.”\nThe sense he had so often had, since the first hour of his\ndisembarkment, of being further and further “in,” treated him again at\nthis moment to another twinge; but in this wonderful way of her putting\nhim in there continued to be something exquisitely remorseless.\n“Monsieur de Vionnet will accept what he _must_ accept. He has proposed\nhalf a dozen things—each one more impossible than the other; and he\nwouldn’t have found this if he lives to a hundred. Chad found it,” she\ncontinued with her lighted, faintly flushed, her conscious confidential\nface, “in the quietest way in the world. Or rather it found _him_—for\neverything finds him; I mean finds him right. You’ll think we do such\nthings strangely—but at my age,” she smiled, “one has to accept one’s\nconditions. Our young man’s people had seen her; one of his sisters, a\ncharming woman—we know all about them—had observed her somewhere with\nme. She had spoken to her brother—turned him on; and we were again\nobserved, poor Jeanne and I, without our in the least knowing it. It\nwas at the beginning of the winter; it went on for some time; it\noutlasted our absence; it began again on our return; and it luckily\nseems all right. The young man had met Chad, and he got a friend to\napproach him—as having a decent interest in us. Mr. Newsome looked well\nbefore he leaped; he kept beautifully quiet and satisfied himself\nfully; then only he spoke. It’s what has for some time past occupied\nus. It seems as if it were what would do; really, really all one could\nwish. There are only two or three points to be settled—they depend on\nher father. But this time I think we’re safe.”\n\nStrether, consciously gaping a little, had fairly hung upon her lips.\n“I hope so with all my heart.” And then he permitted himself: “Does\nnothing depend on _her?_”\n\n“Ah naturally; everything did. But she’s pleased _comme tout_. She has\nbeen perfectly free; and he—our young friend—is really a combination. I\nquite adore him.”\n\nStrether just made sure. “You mean your future son-in-law?”\n\n“Future if we all bring it off.”\n\n“Ah well,” said Strether decorously, “I heartily hope you may.” There\nseemed little else for him to say, though her communication had the\noddest effect on him. Vaguely and confusedly he was troubled by it;\nfeeling as if he had even himself been concerned in something deep and\ndim. He had allowed for depths, but these were greater: and it was as\nif, oppressively—indeed absurdly—he was responsible for what they had\nnow thrown up to the surface. It was—through something ancient and cold\nin it—what he would have called the real thing. In short his hostess’s\nnews, though he couldn’t have explained why, was a sensible shock, and\nhis oppression a weight he felt he must somehow or other immediately\nget rid of. There were too many connexions missing to make it tolerable\nhe should do anything else. He was prepared to suffer—before his own\ninner tribunal—for Chad; he was prepared to suffer even for Madame de\nVionnet. But he wasn’t prepared to suffer for the little girl. So now\nhaving said the proper thing, he wanted to get away. She held him an\ninstant, however, with another appeal.\n\n“Do I seem to you very awful?”\n\n“Awful? Why so?” But he called it to himself, even as he spoke, his\nbiggest insincerity yet.\n\n“Our arrangements are so different from yours.”\n\n“Mine?” Oh he could dismiss that too! “I haven’t any arrangements.”\n\n“Then you must accept mine; all the more that they’re excellent.\nThey’re founded on a _vieille sagesse_. There will be much more, if all\ngoes well, for you to hear and to know, and everything, believe me, for\nyou to like. Don’t be afraid; you’ll be satisfied.” Thus she could talk\nto him of what, of her innermost life—for that was what it came to—he\nmust “accept”; thus she could extraordinarily speak as if in such an\naffair his being satisfied had an importance. It was all a wonder and\nmade the whole case larger. He had struck himself at the hotel, before\nSarah and Waymarsh, as being in her boat; but where on earth was he\nnow? This question was in the air till her own lips quenched it with\nanother. “And do you suppose _he_—who loves her so—would do anything\nreckless or cruel?”\n\nHe wondered what he supposed. “Do you mean your young man—?”\n\n“I mean yours. I mean Mr. Newsome.” It flashed for Strether the next\nmoment a finer light, and the light deepened as she went on. “He takes,\nthank God, the truest tenderest interest in her.”\n\nIt deepened indeed. “Oh I’m sure of that!”\n\n“You were talking,” she said, “about one’s trusting him. You see then\nhow I do.”\n\nHe waited a moment—it all came. “I see—I see.” He felt he really did\nsee.\n\n“He wouldn’t hurt her for the world, nor—assuming she marries at\nall—risk anything that might make against her happiness. And—willingly,\nat least—he would never hurt _me_.”\n\nHer face, with what he had by this time grasped, told him more than her\nwords; whether something had come into it, or whether he only read\nclearer, her whole story—what at least he then took for such—reached\nout to him from it. With the initiative she now attributed to Chad it\nall made a sense, and this sense—a light, a lead, was what had abruptly\nrisen before him. He wanted, once more, to get off with these things;\nwhich was at last made easy, a servant having, for his assistance, on\nhearing voices in the hall, just come forward. All that Strether had\nmade out was, while the man opened the door and impersonally waited,\nsummed up in his last word. “I don’t think, you know, Chad will tell me\nanything.”\n\n“No—perhaps not yet.”\n\n“And I won’t as yet speak to him.”\n\n“Ah that’s as you’ll think best. You must judge.”\n\nShe had finally given him her hand, which he held a moment. “How _much_\nI have to judge!”\n\n“Everything,” said Madame de Vionnet: a remark that was indeed—with the\nrefined disguised suppressed passion of her face—what he most carried\naway.\n\n\n II\n\nSo far as a direct approach was concerned Sarah had neglected him, for\nthe week now about to end, with a civil consistency of chill that,\ngiving him a higher idea of her social resource, threw him back on the\ngeneral reflexion that a woman could always be amazing. It indeed\nhelped a little to console him that he felt sure she had for the same\nperiod also left Chad’s curiosity hanging; though on the other hand,\nfor his personal relief, Chad could at least go through the various\nmotions—and he made them extraordinarily numerous—of seeing she had a\ngood time. There wasn’t a motion on which, in her presence, poor\nStrether could so much as venture, and all he could do when he was out\nof it was to walk over for a talk with Maria. He walked over of course\nmuch less than usual, but he found a special compensation in a certain\nhalf-hour during which, toward the close of a crowded empty expensive\nday, his several companions seemed to him so disposed of as to give his\nforms and usages a rest. He had been with them in the morning and had\nnevertheless called on the Pococks in the afternoon; but their whole\ngroup, he then found, had dispersed after a fashion of which it would\namuse Miss Gostrey to hear. He was sorry again, gratefully sorry she\nwas so out of it—she who had really put him in; but she had fortunately\nalways her appetite for news. The pure flame of the disinterested\nburned in her cave of treasures as a lamp in a Byzantine vault. It was\njust now, as happened, that for so fine a sense as hers a near view\nwould have begun to pay. Within three days, precisely, the situation on\nwhich he was to report had shown signs of an equilibrium; the effect of\nhis look in at the hotel was to confirm this appearance. If the\nequilibrium might only prevail! Sarah was out with Waymarsh, Mamie was\nout with Chad, and Jim was out alone. Later on indeed he himself was\nbooked to Jim, was to take him that evening to the Varieties—which\nStrether was careful to pronounce as Jim pronounced them.\n\nMiss Gostrey drank it in. “What then to-night do the others do?”\n\n“Well, it has been arranged. Waymarsh takes Sarah to dine at Bignon’s.”\n\nShe wondered. “And what do they do after? They can’t come straight\nhome.”\n\n“No, they can’t come straight home—at least Sarah can’t. It’s their\nsecret, but I think I’ve guessed it.” Then as she waited: “The circus.”\n\nIt made her stare a moment longer, then laugh almost to extravagance.\n“There’s no one like you!”\n\n“Like _me?_”—he only wanted to understand.\n\n“Like all of you together—like all of us: Woollett, Milrose and their\nproducts. We’re abysmal—but may we never be less so! Mr. Newsome,” she\ncontinued, “meanwhile takes Miss Pocock—?”\n\n“Precisely—to the Français: to see what _you_ took Waymarsh and me to,\na family-bill.”\n\n“Ah then may Mr. Chad enjoy it as _I_ did!” But she saw so much in\nthings. “Do they spend their evenings, your young people, like that,\nalone together?”\n\n“Well, they’re young people—but they’re old friends.”\n\n“I see, I see. And do _they_ dine—for a difference—at Brébant’s?”\n\n“Oh where they dine is their secret too. But I’ve my idea that it will\nbe, very quietly, at Chad’s own place.”\n\n“She’ll come to him there alone?”\n\nThey looked at each other a moment. “He has known her from a child.\nBesides,” said Strether with emphasis, “Mamie’s remarkable. She’s\nsplendid.”\n\nShe wondered. “Do you mean she expects to bring it off?”\n\n“Getting hold of him? No—I think not.”\n\n“She doesn’t want him enough?—or doesn’t believe in her power?” On\nwhich as he said nothing she continued: “She finds she doesn’t care for\nhim?”\n\n“No—I think she finds she does. But that’s what I mean by so describing\nher. It’s _if_ she does that she’s splendid. But we’ll see,” he wound\nup, “where she comes out.”\n\n“You seem to show me sufficiently,” Miss Gostrey laughed, “where she\ngoes in! But is her childhood’s friend,” she asked, “permitting himself\nrecklessly to flirt with her?”\n\n“No—not that. Chad’s also splendid. They’re _all_ splendid!” he\ndeclared with a sudden strange sound of wistfulness and envy. “They’re\nat least _happy_.”\n\n“Happy?”—it appeared, with their various difficulties, to surprise her.\n\n“Well—I seem to myself among them the only one who isn’t.”\n\nShe demurred. “With your constant tribute to the ideal?”\n\nHe had a laugh at his tribute to the ideal, but he explained after a\nmoment his impression. “I mean they’re living. They’re rushing about.\nI’ve already had my rushing. I’m waiting.”\n\n“But aren’t you,” she asked by way of cheer, “waiting with _me?_”\n\nHe looked at her in all kindness. “Yes—if it weren’t for that!”\n\n“And you help me to wait,” she said. “However,” she went on, “I’ve\nreally something for you that will help you to wait and which you shall\nhave in a minute. Only there’s something more I want from you first. I\nrevel in Sarah.”\n\n“So do I. If it weren’t,” he again amusedly sighed, “for _that_—!”\n\n“Well, you owe more to women than any man I ever saw. We do seem to\nkeep you going. Yet Sarah, as I see her, must be great.”\n\n“She _is_” Strether fully assented: “great! Whatever happens, she\nwon’t, with these unforgettable days, have lived in vain.”\n\nMiss Gostrey had a pause. “You mean she has fallen in love?”\n\n“I mean she wonders if she hasn’t—and it serves all her purpose.”\n\n“It has indeed,” Maria laughed, “served women’s purposes before!”\n\n“Yes—for giving in. But I doubt if the idea—as an idea—has ever up to\nnow answered so well for holding out. That’s _her_ tribute to the\nideal—we each have our own. It’s her romance—and it seems to me better\non the whole than mine. To have it in Paris too,” he explained—“on this\nclassic ground, in this charged infectious air, with so sudden an\nintensity: well, it’s more than she expected. She has had in short to\nrecognise the breaking out for her of a real affinity—and with\neverything to enhance the drama.”\n\nMiss Gostrey followed. “Jim for instance?”\n\n“Jim. Jim hugely enhances. Jim was made to enhance. And then Mr.\nWaymarsh. It’s the crowning touch—it supplies the colour. He’s\npositively separated.”\n\n“And she herself unfortunately isn’t—that supplies the colour too.”\nMiss Gostrey was all there. But somehow—! “Is _he_ in love?”\n\nStrether looked at her a long time; then looked all about the room;\nthen came a little nearer. “Will you never tell any one in the world as\nlong as ever you live?”\n\n“Never.” It was charming.\n\n“He thinks Sarah really is. But he has no fear,” Strether hastened to\nadd.\n\n“Of her being affected by it?”\n\n“Of _his_ being. He likes it, but he knows she can hold out. He’s\nhelping her, he’s floating her over, by kindness.”\n\nMaria rather funnily considered it. “Floating her over in champagne?\nThe kindness of dining her, nose to nose, at the hour when all Paris is\ncrowding to profane delights, and in the—well, in the great temple, as\none hears of it, of pleasure?”\n\n“That’s just _it_, for both of them,” Strether insisted—“and all of a\nsupreme innocence. The Parisian place, the feverish hour, the putting\nbefore her of a hundred francs’ worth of food and drink, which they’ll\nscarcely touch—all that’s the dear man’s own romance; the expensive\nkind, expensive in francs and centimes, in which he abounds. And the\ncircus afterwards—which is cheaper, but which he’ll find some means of\nmaking as dear as possible—that’s also _his_ tribute to the ideal. It\ndoes for him. He’ll see her through. They won’t talk of anything worse\nthan you and me.”\n\n“Well, we’re bad enough perhaps, thank heaven,” she laughed, “to upset\nthem! Mr. Waymarsh at any rate is a hideous old coquette.” And the next\nmoment she had dropped everything for a different pursuit. “What you\ndon’t appear to know is that Jeanne de Vionnet has become engaged.\nShe’s to marry—it has been definitely arranged—young Monsieur de\nMontbron.”\n\nHe fairly blushed. “Then—if you know it—it’s ‘out’?”\n\n“Don’t I often know things that are _not_ out? However,” she said,\n“this will be out to-morrow. But I see I’ve counted too much on your\npossible ignorance. You’ve been before me, and I don’t make you jump as\nI hoped.”\n\nHe gave a gasp at her insight. “You never fail! I’ve _had_ my jump. I\nhad it when I first heard.”\n\n“Then if you knew why didn’t you tell me as soon as you came in?”\n\n“Because I had it from her as a thing not yet to be spoken of.”\n\nMiss Gostrey wondered. “From Madame de Vionnet herself?”\n\n“As a probability—not quite a certainty: a good cause in which Chad has\nbeen working. So I’ve waited.”\n\n“You need wait no longer,” she returned. “It reached me\nyesterday—roundabout and accidental, but by a person who had had it\nfrom one of the young man’s own people—as a thing quite settled. I was\nonly keeping it for you.”\n\n“You thought Chad wouldn’t have told me?”\n\nShe hesitated. “Well, if he hasn’t—”\n\n“He hasn’t. And yet the thing appears to have been practically his\ndoing. So there we are.”\n\n“There we are!” Maria candidly echoed.\n\n“That’s why I jumped. I jumped,” he continued to explain, “because it\nmeans, this disposition of the daughter, that there’s now nothing else:\nnothing else but him and the mother.”\n\n“Still—it simplifies.”\n\n“It simplifies”—he fully concurred. “But that’s precisely where we are.\nIt marks a stage in his relation. The act is his answer to Mrs.\nNewsome’s demonstration.”\n\n“It tells,” Maria asked, “the worst?”\n\n“The worst.”\n\n“But is the worst what he wants Sarah to know?”\n\n“He doesn’t care for Sarah.”\n\nAt which Miss Gostrey’s eyebrows went up. “You mean she has already\ndished herself?”\n\nStrether took a turn about; he had thought it out again and again\nbefore this, to the end; but the vista seemed each time longer. “He\nwants his good friend to know the best. I mean the measure of his\nattachment. She asked for a sign, and he thought of that one. There it\nis.”\n\n“A concession to her jealousy?”\n\nStrether pulled up. “Yes—call it that. Make it lurid—for that makes my\nproblem richer.”\n\n“Certainly, let us have it lurid—for I quite agree with you that we\nwant none of our problems poor. But let us also have it clear. Can he,\nin the midst of such a preoccupation, or on the heels of it, have\nseriously cared for Jeanne?—cared, I mean, as a young man at liberty\nwould have cared?”\n\nWell, Strether had mastered it. “I think he can have thought it would\nbe charming if he _could_ care. It would be nicer.”\n\n“Nicer than being tied up to Marie?”\n\n“Yes—than the discomfort of an attachment to a person he can never\nhope, short of a catastrophe, to marry. And he was quite right,” said\nStrether. “It would certainly have been nicer. Even when a thing’s\nalready nice there mostly _is_ some other thing that would have been\nnicer—or as to which we wonder if it wouldn’t. But his question was all\nthe same a dream. He _couldn’t_ care in that way. He _is_ tied up to\nMarie. The relation is too special and has gone too far. It’s the very\nbasis, and his recent lively contribution toward establishing Jeanne in\nlife has been his definite and final acknowledgement to Madame de\nVionnet that he has ceased squirming. I doubt meanwhile,” he went on,\n“if Sarah has at all directly attacked him.”\n\nHis companion brooded. “But won’t he wish for his own satisfaction to\nmake his ground good to her?”\n\n“No—he’ll leave it to me, he’ll leave everything to me. I ‘sort of’\nfeel”—he worked it out—“that the whole thing will come upon me. Yes, I\nshall have every inch and every ounce of it. I shall be _used_ for\nit—!” And Strether lost himself in the prospect. Then he fancifully\nexpressed the issue. “To the last drop of my blood.”\n\nMaria, however, roundly protested. “Ah you’ll please keep a drop for\n_me_. I shall have a use for it!”—which she didn’t however follow up.\nShe had come back the next moment to another matter. “Mrs. Pocock, with\nher brother, is trusting only to her general charm?”\n\n“So it would seem.”\n\n“And the charm’s not working?”\n\nWell, Strether put it otherwise, “She’s sounding the note of home—which\nis the very best thing she can do.”\n\n“The best for Madame de Vionnet?”\n\n“The best for home itself. The natural one; the right one.”\n\n“Right,” Maria asked, “when it fails?”\n\nStrether had a pause. “The difficulty’s Jim. Jim’s the note of home.”\n\nShe debated. “Ah surely not the note of Mrs. Newsome.”\n\nBut he had it all. “The note of the home for which Mrs. Newsome wants\nhim—the home of the business. Jim stands, with his little legs apart,\nat the door of _that_ tent; and Jim _is_, frankly speaking, extremely\nawful.”\n\nMaria stared. “And you in, you poor thing, for your evening with him?”\n\n“Oh he’s all right for _me!_” Strether laughed. “Any one’s good enough\nfor _me_. But Sarah shouldn’t, all the same, have brought him. She\ndoesn’t appreciate him.”\n\nHis friend was amused with this statement of it. “Doesn’t know, you\nmean, how bad he is?”\n\nStrether shook his head with decision. “Not really.”\n\nShe wondered. “Then doesn’t Mrs. Newsome?”\n\nIt made him frankly do the same. “Well, no—since you ask me.”\n\nMaria rubbed it in. “Not really either?”\n\n“Not at all. She rates him rather high.” With which indeed,\nimmediately, he took himself up. “Well, he _is_ good too, in his way.\nIt depends on what you want him for.”\n\nMiss Gostrey, however, wouldn’t let it depend on anything—wouldn’t have\nit, and wouldn’t want him, at any price. “It suits my book,” she said,\n“that he should be impossible; and it suits it still better,” she more\nimaginatively added, “that Mrs. Newsome doesn’t know he is.”\n\nStrether, in consequence, had to take it from her, but he fell back on\nsomething else. “I’ll tell you who does really know.”\n\n“Mr. Waymarsh? Never!”\n\n“Never indeed. I’m not _always_ thinking of Mr. Waymarsh; in fact I\nfind now I never am.” Then he mentioned the person as if there were a\ngood deal in it. “Mamie.”\n\n“His own sister?” Oddly enough it but let her down. “What good will\nthat do?”\n\n“None perhaps. But there—as usual—we are!”\n\n\n III\n\nThere they were yet again, accordingly, for two days more; when\nStrether, on being, at Mrs. Pocock’s hotel, ushered into that lady’s\nsalon, found himself at first assuming a mistake on the part of the\nservant who had introduced him and retired. The occupants hadn’t come\nin, for the room looked empty as only a room can look in Paris, of a\nfine afternoon when the faint murmur of the huge collective life,\ncarried on out of doors, strays among scattered objects even as a\nsummer air idles in a lonely garden. Our friend looked about and\nhesitated; observed, on the evidence of a table charged with purchases\nand other matters, that Sarah had become possessed—by no aid from\n_him_—of the last number of the salmon-coloured Revue; noted further\nthat Mamie appeared to have received a present of Fromentin’s “Maîtres\nd’Autrefois” from Chad, who had written her name on the cover; and\npulled up at the sight of a heavy letter addressed in a hand he knew.\nThis letter, forwarded by a banker and arriving in Mrs. Pocock’s\nabsence, had been placed in evidence, and it drew from the fact of its\nbeing unopened a sudden queer power to intensify the reach of its\nauthor. It brought home to him the scale on which Mrs. Newsome—for she\nhad been copious indeed this time—was writing to her daughter while she\nkept _him_ in durance; and it had altogether such an effect upon him as\nmade him for a few minutes stand still and breathe low. In his own\nroom, at his own hotel, he had dozens of well-filled envelopes\nsuperscribed in that character; and there was actually something in the\nrenewal of his interrupted vision of the character that played straight\ninto the so frequent question of whether he weren’t already\ndisinherited beyond appeal. It was such an assurance as the sharp\ndownstrokes of her pen hadn’t yet had occasion to give him; but they\nsomehow at the present crisis stood for a probable absoluteness in any\ndecree of the writer. He looked at Sarah’s name and address, in short,\nas if he had been looking hard into her mother’s face, and then turned\nfrom it as if the face had declined to relax. But since it was in a\nmanner as if Mrs. Newsome were thereby all the more, instead of the\nless, in the room, and were conscious, sharply and sorely conscious, of\nhimself, so he felt both held and hushed, summoned to stay at least and\ntake his punishment. By staying, accordingly, he took it—creeping\nsoftly and vaguely about and waiting for Sarah to come in. She _would_\ncome in if he stayed long enough, and he had now more than ever the\nsense of her success in leaving him a prey to anxiety. It wasn’t to be\ndenied that she had had a happy instinct, from the point of view of\nWoollett, in placing him thus at the mercy of her own initiative. It\nwas very well to try to say he didn’t care—that she might break ground\nwhen she would, might never break it at all if she wouldn’t, and that\nhe had no confession whatever to wait upon her with: he breathed from\nday to day an air that damnably required clearing, and there were\nmoments when he quite ached to precipitate that process. He couldn’t\ndoubt that, should she only oblige him by surprising him just as he\nthen was, a clarifying scene of some sort would result from the\nconcussion.\n\nHe humbly circulated in this spirit till he suddenly had a fresh\narrest. Both the windows of the room stood open to the balcony, but it\nwas only now that, in the glass of the leaf of one of them, folded\nback, he caught a reflexion quickly recognised as the colour of a\nlady’s dress. Somebody had been then all the while on the balcony, and\nthe person, whoever it might be, was so placed between the windows as\nto be hidden from him; while on the other hand the many sounds of the\nstreet had covered his own entrance and movements. If the person were\nSarah he might on the spot therefore be served to his taste. He might\nlead her by a move or two up to the remedy for his vain tension; as to\nwhich, should he get nothing else from it, he would at least have the\nrelief of pulling down the roof on their heads. There was fortunately\nno one at hand to observe—in respect to his valour—that even on this\ncompleted reasoning he still hung fire. He had been waiting for Mrs.\nPocock and the sound of the oracle; but he had to gird himself\nafresh—which he did in the embrasure of the window, neither advancing\nnor retreating—before provoking the revelation. It was apparently for\nSarah to come more into view; he was in that case there at her service.\nShe did however, as meanwhile happened, come more into view; only she\nluckily came at the last minute as a contradiction of Sarah. The\noccupant of the balcony was after all quite another person, a person\npresented, on a second look, by a charming back and a slight shift of\nher position, as beautiful brilliant unconscious Mamie—Mamie alone at\nhome, Mamie passing her time in her own innocent way, Mamie in short\nrather shabbily used, but Mamie absorbed interested and interesting.\nWith her arms on the balustrade and her attention dropped to the street\nshe allowed Strether to watch her, to consider several things, without\nher turning round.\n\nBut the oddity was that when he _had_ so watched and considered he\nsimply stepped back into the room without following up his advantage.\nHe revolved there again for several minutes, quite as with something\nnew to think of and as if the bearings of the possibility of Sarah had\nbeen superseded. For frankly, yes, it _had_ bearings thus to find the\ngirl in solitary possession. There was something in it that touched him\nto a point not to have been reckoned beforehand, something that softly\nbut quite pressingly spoke to him, and that spoke the more each time he\npaused again at the edge of the balcony and saw her still unaware. Her\ncompanions were plainly scattered; Sarah would be off somewhere with\nWaymarsh and Chad off somewhere with Jim. Strether didn’t at all\nmentally impute to Chad that he was with his “good friend”; he gave him\nthe benefit of supposing him involved in appearances that, had he had\nto describe them—for instance to Maria—he would have conveniently\nqualified as more subtle. It came to him indeed the next thing that\nthere was perhaps almost an excess of refinement in having left Mamie\nin such weather up there alone; however she might in fact have\nextemporised, under the charm of the Rue de Rivoli, a little makeshift\nParis of wonder and fancy. Our friend in any case now recognised—and it\nwas as if at the recognition Mrs. Newsome’s fixed intensity had\nsuddenly, with a deep audible gasp, grown thin and vague—that day after\nday he had been conscious in respect to his young lady of something odd\nand ambiguous, yet something into which he could at last read a\nmeaning. It had been at the most, this mystery, an obsession—oh an\nobsession agreeable; and it had just now fallen into its place as at\nthe touch of a spring. It had represented the possibility between them\nof some communication baffled by accident and delay—the possibility\neven of some relation as yet unacknowledged.\n\nThere was always their old relation, the fruit of the Woollett years;\nbut that—and it was what was strangest—had nothing whatever in common\nwith what was now in the air. As a child, as a “bud,” and then again as\na flower of expansion, Mamie had bloomed for him, freely, in the almost\nincessantly open doorways of home; where he remembered her as first\nvery forward, as then very backward—for he had carried on at one\nperiod, in Mrs. Newsome’s parlours (oh Mrs. Newsome’s phases and his\nown!) a course of English Literature re-enforced by exams and teas—and\nonce more, finally, as very much in advance. But he had kept no great\nsense of points of contact; it not being in the nature of things at\nWoollett that the freshest of the buds should find herself in the same\nbasket with the most withered of the winter apples. The child had given\nsharpness, above all, to his sense of the flight of time; it was but\nthe day before yesterday that he had tripped up on her hoop, yet his\nexperience of remarkable women—destined, it would seem, remarkably to\ngrow—felt itself ready this afternoon, quite braced itself, to include\nher. She had in fine more to say to him than he had ever dreamed the\npretty girl of the moment _could_ have; and the proof of the\ncircumstance was that, visibly, unmistakeably, she had been able to say\nit to no one else. It was something she could mention neither to her\nbrother, to her sister-in-law nor to Chad; though he could just imagine\nthat had she still been at home she might have brought it out, as a\nsupreme tribute to age, authority and attitude, for Mrs. Newsome. It\nwas moreover something in which they all took an interest; the strength\nof their interest was in truth just the reason of her prudence. All\nthis then, for five minutes, was vivid to Strether, and it put before\nhim that, poor child, she had now but her prudence to amuse her. That,\nfor a pretty girl in Paris, struck him, with a rush, as a sorry state;\nso that under the impression he went out to her with a step as\nhypocritically alert, he was well aware, as if he had just come into\nthe room. She turned with a start at his voice; preoccupied with him\nthough she might be, she was just a scrap disappointed. “Oh I thought\nyou were Mr. Bilham!”\n\nThe remark had been at first surprising and our friend’s private\nthought, under the influence of it, temporarily blighted; yet we are\nable to add that he presently recovered his inward tone and that many a\nfresh flower of fancy was to bloom in the same air. Little Bilham—since\nlittle Bilham was, somewhat incongruously, expected—appeared\nbehindhand; a circumstance by which Strether was to profit. They came\nback into the room together after a little, the couple on the balcony,\nand amid its crimson-and-gold elegance, with the others still absent,\nStrether passed forty minutes that he appraised even at the time as\nfar, in the whole queer connexion, from his idlest. Yes indeed, since\nhe had the other day so agreed with Maria about the inspiration of the\nlurid, here was something for his problem that surely didn’t make it\nshrink and that was floated in upon him as part of a sudden flood. He\nwas doubtless not to know till afterwards, on turning them over in\nthought, of how many elements his impression was composed; but he none\nthe less felt, as he sat with the charming girl, the signal growth of a\nconfidence. For she _was_ charming, when all was said—and none the less\nso for the visible habit and practice of freedom and fluency. She was\ncharming, he was aware, in spite of the fact that if he hadn’t found\nher so he would have found her something he should have been in peril\nof expressing as “funny.” Yes, she was funny, wonderful Mamie, and\nwithout dreaming it; she was bland, she was bridal—with never, that he\ncould make out as yet, a bridegroom to support it; she was handsome and\nportly and easy and chatty, soft and sweet and almost disconcertingly\nreassuring. She was dressed, if we might so far discriminate, less as a\nyoung lady than as an old one—had an old one been supposable to\nStrether as so committed to vanity; the complexities of her hair missed\nmoreover also the looseness of youth; and she had a mature manner of\nbending a little, as to encourage and reward, while she held neatly\ntogether in front of her a pair of strikingly polished hands: the\ncombination of all of which kept up about her the glamour of her\n“receiving,” placed her again perpetually between the windows and\nwithin sound of the ice-cream plates, suggested the enumeration of all\nthe names, all the Mr. Brookses and Mr. Snookses, gregarious specimens\nof a single type, she was happy to “meet.” But if all this was where\nshe was funny, and if what was funnier than the rest was the contrast\nbetween her beautiful benevolent patronage—such a hint of the\npolysyllabic as might make her something of a bore toward middle\nage—and her rather flat little voice, the voice, naturally,\nunaffectedly yet, of a girl of fifteen; so Strether, none the less, at\nthe end of ten minutes, felt in her a quiet dignity that pulled things\nbravely together. If quiet dignity, almost more than matronly, with\nvoluminous, too voluminous clothes, was the effect she proposed to\nproduce, that was an ideal one could like in her when once one had got\ninto relation. The great thing now for her visitor was that this was\nexactly what he had done; it made so extraordinary a mixture of the\nbrief and crowded hour. It was the mark of a relation that he had begun\nso quickly to find himself sure she was, of all people, as might have\nbeen said, on the side and of the party of Mrs. Newsome’s original\nambassador. She was in _his_ interest and not in Sarah’s, and some sign\nof that was precisely what he had been feeling in her, these last days,\nas imminent. Finally placed, in Paris, in immediate presence of the\nsituation and of the hero of it—by whom Strether was incapable of\nmeaning any one but Chad—she had accomplished, and really in a manner\nall unexpected to herself, a change of base; deep still things had come\nto pass within her, and by the time she had grown sure of them Strether\nhad become aware of the little drama. When she knew where she was, in\nshort, he had made it out; and he made it out at present still better;\nthough with never a direct word passing between them all the while on\nthe subject of his own predicament. There had been at first, as he sat\nthere with her, a moment during which he wondered if she meant to break\nground in respect to his prime undertaking. That door stood so\nstrangely ajar that he was half-prepared to be conscious, at any\njuncture, of her having, of any one’s having, quite bounced in. But,\nfriendly, familiar, light of touch and happy of tact, she exquisitely\nstayed out; so that it was for all the world as if to show she could\ndeal with him without being reduced to—well, scarcely anything.\n\nIt fully came up for them then, by means of their talking of everything\n_but_ Chad, that Mamie, unlike Sarah, unlike Jim, knew perfectly what\nhad become of him. It fully came up that she had taken to the last\nfraction of an inch the measure of the change in him, and that she\nwanted Strether to know what a secret she proposed to make of it. They\ntalked most conveniently—as if they had had no chance yet—about\nWoollett; and that had virtually the effect of their keeping the secret\nmore close. The hour took on for Strether, little by little, a queer\nsad sweetness of quality, he had such a revulsion in Mamie’s favour and\non behalf of her social value as might have come from remorse at some\nearly injustice. She made him, as under the breath of some vague\nwestern whiff, homesick and freshly restless; he could really for the\ntime have fancied himself stranded with her on a far shore, during an\nominous calm, in a quaint community of shipwreck. Their little\ninterview was like a picnic on a coral strand; they passed each other,\nwith melancholy smiles and looks sufficiently allusive, such cupfuls of\nwater as they had saved. Especially sharp in Strether meanwhile was the\nconviction that his companion really knew, as we have hinted, where she\nhad come out. It was at a very particular place—only _that_ she would\nnever tell him; it would be above all what he should have to puzzle for\nhimself. This was what he hoped for, because his interest in the girl\nwouldn’t be complete without it. No more would the appreciation to\nwhich she was entitled—so assured was he that the more he saw of her\nprocess the more he should see of her pride. She saw, herself,\neverything; but she knew what she didn’t want, and that it was that had\nhelped her. What didn’t she want?—there was a pleasure lost for her old\nfriend in not yet knowing, as there would doubtless be a thrill in\ngetting a glimpse. Gently and sociably she kept that dark to him, and\nit was as if she soothed and beguiled him in other ways to make up for\nit. She came out with her impression of Madame de Vionnet—of whom she\nhad “heard so much”; she came out with her impression of Jeanne, whom\nshe had been “dying to see”: she brought it out with a blandness by\nwhich her auditor was really stirred that she had been with Sarah early\nthat very afternoon, and after dreadful delays caused by all sorts of\nthings, mainly, eternally, by the purchase of clothes—clothes that\nunfortunately wouldn’t be themselves eternal—to call in the Rue de\nBellechasse.\n\nAt the sound of these names Strether almost blushed to feel that he\ncouldn’t have sounded them first—and yet couldn’t either have justified\nhis squeamishness. Mamie made them easy as he couldn’t have begun to\ndo, and yet it could only have cost her more than he should ever have\nhad to spend. It was as friends of Chad’s, friends special,\ndistinguished, desirable, enviable, that she spoke of them, and she\nbeautifully carried it off that much as she had heard of them—though\nshe didn’t say how or where, which was a touch of her own—she had found\nthem beyond her supposition. She abounded in praise of them, and after\nthe manner of Woollett—which made the manner of Woollett a loveable\nthing again to Strether. He had never so felt the true inwardness of it\nas when his blooming companion pronounced the elder of the ladies of\nthe Rue de Bellechasse too fascinating for words and declared of the\nyounger that she was perfectly ideal, a real little monster of charm.\n“Nothing,” she said of Jeanne, “ought ever to happen to her—she’s so\nawfully right as she is. Another touch will spoil her—so she oughtn’t\nto _be_ touched.”\n\n“Ah but things, here in Paris,” Strether observed, “do happen to little\ngirls.” And then for the joke’s and the occasion’s sake: “Haven’t you\nfound that yourself?”\n\n“That things happen—? Oh I’m not a little girl. I’m a big battered\nblowsy one. _I_ don’t care,” Mamie laughed, “_what_ happens.”\n\nStrether had a pause while he wondered if it mightn’t happen that he\nshould give her the pleasure of learning that he found her nicer than\nhe had really dreamed—a pause that ended when he had said to himself\nthat, so far as it at all mattered for her, she had in fact perhaps\nalready made this out. He risked accordingly a different\nquestion—though conscious, as soon as he had spoken, that he seemed to\nplace it in relation to her last speech. “But that Mademoiselle de\nVionnet is to be married—I suppose you’ve heard of _that_.”\n\nFor all, he then found, he need fear! “Dear, yes; the gentleman was\nthere: Monsieur de Montbron, whom Madame de Vionnet presented to us.”\n\n“And was he nice?”\n\nMamie bloomed and bridled with her best reception manner. “Any man’s\nnice when he’s in love.”\n\nIt made Strether laugh. “But is Monsieur de Montbron in\nlove—already—with _you?_”\n\n“Oh that’s not necessary—it’s so much better he should be so with\n_her_: which, thank goodness, I lost no time in discovering for myself.\nHe’s perfectly gone—and I couldn’t have borne it for her if he hadn’t\nbeen. She’s just too sweet.”\n\nStrether hesitated. “And through being in love too?”\n\nOn which with a smile that struck him as wonderful Mamie had a\nwonderful answer. “She doesn’t know if she is or not.”\n\nIt made him again laugh out. “Oh but _you_ do!”\n\nShe was willing to take it that way. “Oh yes, I know everything.” And\nas she sat there rubbing her polished hands and making the best of\nit—only holding her elbows perhaps a little too much out—the momentary\neffect for Strether was that every one else, in all their affair,\nseemed stupid.\n\n“Know that poor little Jeanne doesn’t know what’s the matter with her?”\n\nIt was as near as they came to saying that she was probably in love\nwith Chad; but it was quite near enough for what Strether wanted; which\nwas to be confirmed in his certitude that, whether in love or not, she\nappealed to something large and easy in the girl before him. Mamie\nwould be fat, too fat, at thirty; but she would always be the person\nwho, at the present sharp hour, had been disinterestedly tender. “If I\nsee a little more of her, as I hope I shall, I think she’ll like me\nenough—for she seemed to like me to-day—to want me to tell her.”\n\n“And _shall_ you?”\n\n“Perfectly. I shall tell her the matter with her is that she wants only\ntoo much to do right. To do right for her, naturally,” said Mamie, “is\nto please.”\n\n“Her mother, do you mean?”\n\n“Her mother first.”\n\nStrether waited. “And then?”\n\n“Well, ‘then’—Mr. Newsome.”\n\nThere was something really grand for him in the serenity of this\nreference. “And last only Monsieur de Montbron?”\n\n“Last only”—she good-humouredly kept it up.\n\nStrether considered. “So that every one after all then will be suited?”\n\nShe had one of her few hesitations, but it was a question only of a\nmoment; and it was her nearest approach to being explicit with him\nabout what was between them. “I think I can speak for myself. _I_ shall\nbe.”\n\nIt said indeed so much, told such a story of her being ready to help\nhim, so committed to him that truth, in short, for such use as he might\nmake of it toward those ends of his own with which, patiently and\ntrustfully, she had nothing to do—it so fully achieved all this that he\nappeared to himself simply to meet it in its own spirit by the last\nfrankness of admiration. Admiration was of itself almost accusatory,\nbut nothing less would serve to show her how nearly he understood. He\nput out his hand for good-bye with a “Splendid, splendid, splendid!”\nAnd he left her, in her splendour, still waiting for little Bilham.\n\n\nBook Tenth\n\n\n I\n\nStrether occupied beside little Bilham, three evenings after his\ninterview with Mamie Pocock, the same deep divan they had enjoyed\ntogether on the first occasion of our friend’s meeting Madame de\nVionnet and her daughter in the apartment of the Boulevard Malesherbes,\nwhere his position affirmed itself again as ministering to an easy\nexchange of impressions. The present evening had a different stamp; if\nthe company was much more numerous, so, inevitably, were the ideas set\nin motion. It was on the other hand, however, now strongly marked that\nthe talkers moved, in respect to such matters, round an inner, a\nprotected circle. They knew at any rate what really concerned them\nto-night, and Strether had begun by keeping his companion close to it.\nOnly a few of Chad’s guests had dined—that is fifteen or twenty, a few\ncompared with the large concourse offered to sight by eleven o’clock;\nbut number and mass, quantity and quality, light, fragrance, sound, the\noverflow of hospitality meeting the high tide of response, had all from\nthe first pressed upon Strether’s consciousness, and he felt himself\nsomehow part and parcel of the most festive scene, as the term was, in\nwhich he had ever in his life been engaged. He had perhaps seen, on\nFourths of July and on dear old domestic Commencements, more people\nassembled, but he had never seen so many in proportion to the space, or\nhad at all events never known so great a promiscuity to show so\nmarkedly as picked. Numerous as was the company, it had still been made\nso by selection, and what was above all rare for Strether was that, by\nno fault of his own, he was in the secret of the principle that had\nworked. He hadn’t enquired, he had averted his head, but Chad had put\nhim a pair of questions that themselves smoothed the ground. He hadn’t\nanswered the questions, he had replied that they were the young man’s\nown affair; and he had then seen perfectly that the latter’s direction\nwas already settled.\n\nChad had applied for counsel only by way of intimating that he knew\nwhat to do; and he had clearly never known it better than in now\npresenting to his sister the whole circle of his society. This was all\nin the sense and the spirit of the note struck by him on that lady’s\narrival; he had taken at the station itself a line that led him without\na break, and that enabled him to lead the Pococks—though dazed a\nlittle, no doubt, breathless, no doubt, and bewildered—to the uttermost\nend of the passage accepted by them perforce as pleasant. He had made\nit for them violently pleasant and mercilessly full; the upshot of\nwhich was, to Strether’s vision, that they had come all the way without\ndiscovering it to be really no passage at all. It was a brave blind\nalley, where to pass was impossible and where, unless they stuck fast,\nthey would have—which was always awkward—publicly to back out. They\nwere touching bottom assuredly tonight; the whole scene represented the\nterminus of the _cul-de-sac_. So could things go when there was a hand\nto keep them consistent—a hand that pulled the wire with a skill at\nwhich the elder man more and more marvelled. The elder man felt\nresponsible, but he also felt successful, since what had taken place\nwas simply the issue of his own contention, six weeks before, that they\nproperly should wait to see what their friends would have really to\nsay. He had determined Chad to wait, he had determined him to see; he\nwas therefore not to quarrel with the time given up to the business. As\nmuch as ever, accordingly, now that a fortnight had elapsed, the\nsituation created for Sarah, and against which she had raised no\nprotest, was that of her having accommodated herself to her adventure\nas to a pleasure-party surrendered perhaps even somewhat in excess to\nbustle and to “pace.” If her brother had been at any point the least\nbit open to criticism it might have been on the ground of his spicing\nthe draught too highly and pouring the cup too full. Frankly treating\nthe whole occasion of the presence of his relatives as an opportunity\nfor amusement, he left it, no doubt, but scant margin as an opportunity\nfor anything else. He suggested, invented, abounded—yet all the while\nwith the loosest easiest rein. Strether, during his own weeks, had\ngained a sense of knowing Paris; but he saw it afresh, and with fresh\nemotion, in the form of the knowledge offered to his colleague.\n\nA thousand unuttered thoughts hummed for him in the air of these\nobservations; not the least frequent of which was that Sarah might well\nof a truth not quite know whither she was drifting. She was in no\nposition not to appear to expect that Chad should treat her handsomely;\nyet she struck our friend as privately stiffening a little each time\nshe missed the chance of marking the great _nuance_. The great _nuance_\nwas in brief that of course her brother must treat her handsomely—she\nshould like to see him not; but that treating her handsomely, none the\nless, wasn’t all in all—treating her handsomely buttered no parsnips;\nand that in fine there were moments when she felt the fixed eyes of\ntheir admirable absent mother fairly screw into the flat of her back.\nStrether, watching, after his habit, and overscoring with thought,\npositively had moments of his own in which he found himself sorry for\nher—occasions on which she affected him as a person seated in a runaway\nvehicle and turning over the question of a possible jump. _Would_ she\njump, could she, would _that_ be a safe place?—this question, at such\ninstants, sat for him in her lapse into pallor, her tight lips, her\nconscious eyes. It came back to the main point at issue: would she be,\nafter all, to be squared? He believed on the whole she would jump; yet\nhis alternations on this subject were the more especial stuff of his\nsuspense. One thing remained well before him—a conviction that was in\nfact to gain sharpness from the impressions of this evening: that if\nshe _should_ gather in her skirts, close her eyes and quit the carriage\nwhile in motion, he would promptly enough become aware. She would\nalight from her headlong course more or less directly upon him; it\nwould be appointed to him, unquestionably, to receive her entire\nweight. Signs and portents of the experience thus in reserve for him\nhad as it happened, multiplied even through the dazzle of Chad’s party.\nIt was partly under the nervous consciousness of such a prospect that,\nleaving almost every one in the two other rooms, leaving those of the\nguests already known to him as well as a mass of brilliant strangers of\nboth sexes and of several varieties of speech, he had desired five\nquiet minutes with little Bilham, whom he always found soothing and\neven a little inspiring, and to whom he had actually moreover something\ndistinct and important to say.\n\nHe had felt of old—for it already seemed long ago—rather humiliated at\ndiscovering he could learn in talk with a personage so much his junior\nthe lesson of a certain moral ease; but he had now got used to\nthat—whether or no the mixture of the fact with other humiliations had\nmade it indistinct, whether or no directly from little Bilham’s\nexample, the example of his being contentedly just the obscure and\nacute little Bilham he was. It worked so for him, Strether seemed to\nsee; and our friend had at private hours a wan smile over the fact that\nhe himself, after so many more years, was still in search of something\nthat would work. However, as we have said, it worked just now for them\nequally to have found a corner a little apart. What particularly kept\nit apart was the circumstance that the music in the salon was\nadmirable, with two or three such singers as it was a privilege to hear\nin private. Their presence gave a distinction to Chad’s entertainment,\nand the interest of calculating their effect on Sarah was actually so\nsharp as to be almost painful. Unmistakeably, in her single person, the\nmotive of the composition and dressed in a splendour of crimson which\naffected Strether as the sound of a fall through a skylight, she would\nnow be in the forefront of the listening circle and committed by it up\nto her eyes. Those eyes during the wonderful dinner itself he hadn’t\nonce met; having confessedly—perhaps a little pusillanimously—arranged\nwith Chad that he should be on the same side of the table. But there\nwas no use in having arrived now with little Bilham at an unprecedented\npoint of intimacy unless he could pitch everything into the pot. “You\nwho sat where you could see her, what does she make of it all? By which\nI mean on what terms does she take it?”\n\n“Oh she takes it, I judge, as proving that the claim of his family is\nmore than ever justified.”\n\n“She isn’t then pleased with what he has to show?”\n\n“On the contrary; she’s pleased with it as with his capacity to do this\nkind of thing—more than she has been pleased with anything for a long\ntime. But she wants him to show it _there_. He has no right to waste it\non the likes of us.”\n\nStrether wondered. “She wants him to move the whole thing over?”\n\n“The whole thing—with an important exception. Everything he has ‘picked\nup’—and the way he knows how. She sees no difficulty in that. She’d run\nthe show herself, and she’ll make the handsome concession that Woollett\nwould be on the whole in some ways the better for it. Not that it\nwouldn’t be also in some ways the better for Woollett. The people there\nare just as good.”\n\n“Just as good as you and these others? Ah that may be. But such an\noccasion as this, whether or no,” Strether said, “isn’t the people.\nIt’s what has made the people possible.”\n\n“Well then,” his friend replied, “there you are; I give you my\nimpression for what it’s worth. Mrs. Pocock has _seen_, and that’s\nto-night how she sits there. If you were to have a glimpse of her face\nyou’d understand me. She has made up her mind—to the sound of expensive\nmusic.”\n\nStrether took it freely in. “Ah then I shall have news of her.”\n\n“I don’t want to frighten you, but I think that likely. However,”\nlittle Bilham continued, “if I’m of the least use to you to hold on\nby—!”\n\n“You’re not of the least!”—and Strether laid an appreciative hand on\nhim to say it. “No one’s of the least.” With which, to mark how gaily\nhe could take it, he patted his companion’s knee. “I must meet my fate\nalone, and I _shall_—oh you’ll see! And yet,” he pursued the next\nmoment, “you _can_ help me too. You once said to me”—he followed this\nfurther—“that you held Chad should marry. I didn’t see then so well as\nI know now that you meant he should marry Miss Pocock. Do you still\nconsider that he should? Because if you do”—he kept it up—“I want you\nimmediately to change your mind. You can help me that way.”\n\n“Help you by thinking he should _not_ marry?”\n\n“Not marry at all events Mamie.”\n\n“And who then?”\n\n“Ah,” Strether returned, “that I’m not obliged to say. But Madame de\nVionnet—I suggest—when he can.’\n\n“Oh!” said little Bilham with some sharpness.\n\n“Oh precisely! But he needn’t marry at all—I’m at any rate not obliged\nto provide for it. Whereas in your case I rather feel that I _am_.”\n\nLittle Bilham was amused. “Obliged to provide for my marrying?”\n\n“Yes—after all I’ve done to you!”\n\nThe young man weighed it. “Have you done as much as that?”\n\n“Well,” said Strether, thus challenged, “of course I must remember what\nyou’ve also done to _me_. We may perhaps call it square. But all the\nsame,” he went on, “I wish awfully you’d marry Mamie Pocock yourself.”\n\nLittle Bilham laughed out. “Why it was only the other night, in this\nvery place, that you were proposing to me a different union\naltogether.”\n\n“Mademoiselle de Vionnet?” Well, Strether easily confessed it. “That, I\nadmit, was a vain image. _This_ is practical politics. I want to do\nsomething good for both of you—I wish you each so well; and you can see\nin a moment the trouble it will save me to polish you off by the same\nstroke. She likes you, you know. You console her. And she’s splendid.”\n\nLittle Bilham stared as a delicate appetite stares at an overheaped\nplate. “What do I console her for?”\n\nIt just made his friend impatient. “Oh come, you know!”\n\n“And what proves for you that she likes me?”\n\n“Why the fact that I found her three days ago stopping at home alone\nall the golden afternoon on the mere chance that you’d come to her, and\nhanging over her balcony on that of seeing your cab drive up. I don’t\nknow what you want more.”\n\nLittle Bilham after a moment found it. “Only just to know what proves\nto you that I like _her_.”\n\n“Oh if what I’ve just mentioned isn’t enough to make you do it, you’re\na stony-hearted little fiend. Besides”—Strether encouraged his fancy’s\nflight—“you showed your inclination in the way you kept her waiting,\nkept her on purpose to see if she cared enough for you.”\n\nHis companion paid his ingenuity the deference of a pause. “I didn’t\nkeep her waiting. I came at the hour. I wouldn’t have kept her waiting\nfor the world,” the young man honourably declared.\n\n“Better still—then there you are!” And Strether, charmed, held him the\nfaster. “Even if you didn’t do her justice, moreover,” he continued, “I\nshould insist on your immediately coming round to it. I want awfully to\nhave worked it. I want”—and our friend spoke now with a yearning that\nwas really earnest—“at least to have done _that_.”\n\n“To have married me off—without a penny?”\n\n“Well, I shan’t live long; and I give you my word, now and here, that\nI’ll leave you every penny of my own. I haven’t many, unfortunately,\nbut you shall have them all. And Miss Pocock, I think, has a few. I\nwant,” Strether went on, “to have been at least to that extent\nconstructive even expiatory. I’ve been sacrificing so to strange gods\nthat I feel I want to put on record, somehow, my fidelity—fundamentally\nunchanged after all—to our own. I feel as if my hands were embrued with\nthe blood of monstrous alien altars—of another faith altogether. There\nit is—it’s done.” And then he further explained. “It took hold of me\nbecause the idea of getting her quite out of the way for Chad helps to\nclear my ground.”\n\nThe young man, at this, bounced about, and it brought them face to face\nin admitted amusement. “You want me to marry as a convenience to Chad?”\n\n“No,” Strether debated—“_he_ doesn’t care whether you marry or not.\nIt’s as a convenience simply to my own plan _for_ him.”\n\n“‘Simply’!”—and little Bilham’s concurrence was in itself a lively\ncomment. “Thank you. But I thought,” he continued, “you had exactly\n_no_ plan ‘for’ him.”\n\n“Well then call it my plan for myself—which may be well, as you say, to\nhave none. His situation, don’t you see? is reduced now to the bare\nfacts one has to recognise. Mamie doesn’t want him, and he doesn’t want\nMamie: so much as that these days have made clear. It’s a thread we can\nwind up and tuck in.”\n\nBut little Bilham still questioned. “_You_ can—since you seem so much\nto want to. But why should I?”\n\nPoor Strether thought it over, but was obliged of course to admit that\nhis demonstration did superficially fail. “Seriously, there _is_ no\nreason. It’s my affair—I must do it alone. I’ve only my fantastic need\nof making my dose stiff.”\n\nLittle Bilham wondered. “What do you call your dose?”\n\n“Why what I have to swallow. I want my conditions unmitigated.”\n\nHe had spoken in the tone of talk for talk’s sake, and yet with an\nobscure truth lurking in the loose folds; a circumstance presently not\nwithout its effect on his young friend. Little Bilham’s eyes rested on\nhim a moment with some intensity; then suddenly, as if everything had\ncleared up, he gave a happy laugh. It seemed to say that if pretending,\nor even trying, or still even hoping, to be able to care for Mamie\nwould be of use, he was all there for the job. “I’ll do anything in the\nworld for you!”\n\n“Well,” Strether smiled, “anything in the world is all I want. I don’t\nknow anything that pleased me in her more,” he went on, “than the way\nthat, on my finding her up there all alone, coming on her unawares and\nfeeling greatly for her being so out of it, she knocked down my tall\nhouse of cards with her instant and cheerful allusion to the next young\nman. It was somehow so the note I needed—her staying at home to receive\nhim.”\n\n“It was Chad of course,” said little Bilham, “who asked the next young\nman—I like your name for me!—to call.”\n\n“So I supposed—all of which, thank God, is in our innocent and natural\nmanners. But do you know,” Strether asked, “if Chad knows—?” And then\nas this interlocutor seemed at a loss: “Why where she has come out.”\n\nLittle Bilham, at this, met his face with a conscious look—it was as\nif, more than anything yet, the allusion had penetrated. “Do you know\nyourself?”\n\nStrether lightly shook his head. “There I stop. Oh, odd as it may\nappear to you, there _are_ things I don’t know. I only got the sense\nfrom her of something very sharp, and yet very deep down, that she was\nkeeping all to herself. That is I had begun with the belief that she\n_had_ kept it to herself; but face to face with her there I soon made\nout that there was a person with whom she would have shared it. I had\nthought she possibly might with _me_—but I saw then that I was only\nhalf in her confidence. When, turning to me to greet me—for she was on\nthe balcony and I had come in without her knowing it—she showed me she\nhad been expecting _you_ and was proportionately disappointed, I got\nhold of the tail of my conviction. Half an hour later I was in\npossession of all the rest of it. You know what has happened.” He\nlooked at his young friend hard—then he felt sure. “For all you say,\nyou’re up to your eyes. So there you are.”\n\nLittle Bilham after an instant pulled half round. “I assure you she\nhasn’t told me anything.”\n\n“Of course she hasn’t. For what do you suggest that I suppose her to\ntake you? But you’ve been with her every day, you’ve seen her freely,\nyou’ve liked her greatly—I stick to that—and you’ve made your profit of\nit. You know what she has been through as well as you know that she has\ndined here to-night—which must have put her, by the way, through a good\ndeal more.”\n\nThe young man faced this blast; after which he pulled round the rest of\nthe way. “I haven’t in the least said she hasn’t been nice to me. But\nshe’s proud.”\n\n“And quite properly. But not too proud for that.”\n\n“It’s just her pride that has made her. Chad,” little Bilham loyally\nwent on, “has really been as kind to her as possible. It’s awkward for\na man when a girl’s in love with him.”\n\n“Ah but she isn’t—now.”\n\nLittle Bilham sat staring before him; then he sprang up as if his\nfriend’s penetration, recurrent and insistent, made him really after\nall too nervous. “No—she isn’t now. It isn’t in the least,” he went on,\n“Chad’s fault. He’s really all right. I mean he would have been\nwilling. But she came over with ideas. Those she had got at home. They\nhad been her motive and support in joining her brother and his wife.\nShe was to _save_ our friend.”\n\n“Ah like me, poor thing?” Strether also got to his feet.\n\n“Exactly—she had a bad moment. It was very soon distinct to her, to\npull her up, to let her down, that, alas, he was, he _is_, saved.\nThere’s nothing left for her to do.”\n\n“Not even to love him?”\n\n“She would have loved him better as she originally believed him.”\n\nStrether wondered. “Of course one asks one’s self what notion a little\ngirl forms, where a young man’s in question, of such a history and such\na state.”\n\n“Well, this little girl saw them, no doubt, as obscure, but she saw\nthem practically as wrong. The wrong for her _was_ the obscure. Chad\nturns out at any rate right and good and disconcerting, while what she\nwas all prepared for, primed and girded and wound up for, was to deal\nwith him as the general opposite.”\n\n“Yet wasn’t her whole point”—Strether weighed it—“that he was to be,\nthat he _could_ be, made better, redeemed?”\n\nLittle Bilham fixed it all a moment, and then with a small headshake\nthat diffused a tenderness: “She’s too late. Too late for the miracle.”\n\n“Yes”—his companion saw enough. “Still, if the worst fault of his\ncondition is that it may be all there for her to profit by—?”\n\n“Oh she doesn’t want to ‘profit,’ in that flat way. She doesn’t want to\nprofit by another woman’s work—she wants the miracle to have been her\nown miracle. _That’s_ what she’s too late for.”\n\nStrether quite felt how it all fitted, yet there seemed one loose\npiece. “I’m bound to say, you know, that she strikes one, on these\nlines, as fastidious—what you call here _difficile_.”\n\nLittle Bilham tossed up his chin. “Of course she’s _difficile_—on any\nlines! What else in the world _are_ our Mamies—the real, the right\nones?”\n\n“I see, I see,” our friend repeated, charmed by the responsive wisdom\nhe had ended by so richly extracting. “Mamie is one of the real and the\nright.”\n\n“The very thing itself.”\n\n“And what it comes to then,” Strether went on, “is that poor awful Chad\nis simply too good for her.”\n\n“Ah too good was what he was after all to be; but it was she herself,\nand she herself only, who was to have made him so.”\n\nIt hung beautifully together, but with still a loose end. “Wouldn’t he\ndo for her even if he should after all break—”\n\n“With his actual influence?” Oh little Bilham had for this enquiry the\nsharpest of all his controls. “How can he ‘do’—on any terms\nwhatever—when he’s flagrantly spoiled?”\n\nStrether could only meet the question with his passive, his receptive\npleasure. “Well, thank goodness, _you’re_ not! _You_ remain for her to\nsave, and I come back, on so beautiful and full a demonstration, to my\ncontention of just now—that of your showing distinct signs of her\nhaving already begun.”\n\nThe most he could further say to himself—as his young friend turned\naway—was that the charge encountered for the moment no renewed denial.\nLittle Bilham, taking his course back to the music, only shook his\ngood-natured ears an instant, in the manner of a terrier who has got\nwet; while Strether relapsed into the sense—which had for him in these\ndays most of comfort—that he was free to believe in anything that from\nhour to hour kept him going. He had positively motions and flutters of\nthis conscious hour-to-hour kind, temporary surrenders to irony, to\nfancy, frequent instinctive snatches at the growing rose of\nobservation, constantly stronger for him, as he felt, in scent and\ncolour, and in which he could bury his nose even to wantonness. This\nlast resource was offered him, for that matter, in the very form of his\nnext clear perception—the vision of a prompt meeting, in the doorway of\nthe room, between little Bilham and brilliant Miss Barrace, who was\nentering as Bilham withdrew. She had apparently put him a question, to\nwhich he had replied by turning to indicate his late interlocutor;\ntoward whom, after an interrogation further aided by a resort to that\noptical machinery which seemed, like her other ornaments, curious and\narchaic, the genial lady, suggesting more than ever for her fellow\nguest the old French print, the historic portrait, directed herself\nwith an intention that Strether instantly met. He knew in advance the\nfirst note she would sound, and took in as she approached all her need\nof sounding it. Nothing yet had been so “wonderful” between them as the\npresent occasion; and it was her special sense of this quality in\noccasions that she was there, as she was in most places, to feed. That\nsense had already been so well fed by the situation about them that she\nhad quitted the other room, forsaken the music, dropped out of the\nplay, abandoned, in a word, the stage itself, that she might stand a\nminute behind the scenes with Strether and so perhaps figure as one of\nthe famous augurs replying, behind the oracle, to the wink of the\nother. Seated near him presently where little Bilham had sat, she\nreplied in truth to many things; beginning as soon as he had said to\nher—what he hoped he said without fatuity—“All you ladies are\nextraordinarily kind to me.”\n\nShe played her long handle, which shifted her observation; she saw in\nan instant all the absences that left them free. “How can we be\nanything else? But isn’t that exactly your plight? ‘We ladies’—oh we’re\nnice, and you must be having enough of us! As one of us, you know, I\ndon’t pretend I’m crazy about us. But Miss Gostrey at least to-night\nhas left you alone, hasn’t she?” With which she again looked about as\nif Maria might still lurk.\n\n“Oh yes,” said Strether; “she’s only sitting up for me at home.” And\nthen as this elicited from his companion her gay “Oh, oh, oh!” he\nexplained that he meant sitting up in suspense and prayer. “We thought\nit on the whole better she shouldn’t be present; and either way of\ncourse it’s a terrible worry for her.” He abounded in the sense of his\nappeal to the ladies, and they might take their choice of his doing so\nfrom humility or from pride. “Yet she inclines to believe I shall come\nout.”\n\n“Oh I incline to believe too you’ll come out!”—Miss Barrace, with her\nlaugh, was not to be behind. “Only the question’s about _where_, isn’t\nit? However,” she happily continued, “if it’s anywhere at all it must\nbe very far on, mustn’t it? To do us justice, I think, you know,” she\nlaughed, “we do, among us all, want you rather far on. Yes, yes,” she\nrepeated in her quick droll way; “we want you very, _very_ far on!”\nAfter which she wished to know why he had thought it better Maria\nshouldn’t be present.\n\n“Oh,” he replied, “it was really her own idea. I should have wished it.\nBut she dreads responsibility.”\n\n“And isn’t that a new thing for her?”\n\n“To dread it? No doubt—no doubt. But her nerve has given way.”\n\nMiss Barrace looked at him a moment. “She has too much at stake.” Then\nless gravely: “Mine, luckily for me, holds out.”\n\n“Luckily for me too”—Strether came back to that. “My own isn’t so firm,\n_my_ appetite for responsibility isn’t so sharp, as that I haven’t felt\nthe very principle of this occasion to be ‘the more the merrier.’ If we\n_are_ so merry it’s because Chad has understood so well.”\n\n“He has understood amazingly,” said Miss Barrace.\n\n“It’s wonderful—Strether anticipated for her.\n\n“It’s wonderful!” she, to meet it, intensified; so that, face to face\nover it, they largely and recklessly laughed. But she presently added:\n“Oh I see the principle. If one didn’t one would be lost. But when once\none has got hold of it—”\n\n“It’s as simple as twice two! From the moment he had to do something—”\n\n“A crowd”—she took him straight up—“was the only thing? Rather, rather:\na rumpus of sound,” she laughed, “or nothing. Mrs. Pocock’s built in,\nor built out—whichever you call it; she’s packed so tight she can’t\nmove. She’s in splendid isolation”—Miss Barrace embroidered the theme.\n\nStrether followed, but scrupulous of justice. “Yet with every one in\nthe place successively introduced to her.”\n\n“Wonderfully—but just so that it does build her out. She’s bricked up,\nshe’s buried alive!”\n\nStrether seemed for a moment to look at it; but it brought him to a\nsigh. “Oh but she’s not dead! It will take more than this to kill her.”\n\nHis companion had a pause that might have been for pity. “No, I can’t\npretend I think she’s finished—or that it’s for more than to-night.”\nShe remained pensive as if with the same compunction. “It’s only up to\nher chin.” Then again for the fun of it: “She can breathe.”\n\n“She can breathe!”—he echoed it in the same spirit. “And do you know,”\nhe went on, “what’s really all this time happening to me?—through the\nbeauty of music, the gaiety of voices, the uproar in short of our revel\nand the felicity of your wit? The sound of Mrs. Pocock’s respiration\ndrowns for me, I assure you, every other. It’s literally all I hear.”\n\nShe focussed him with her clink of chains. “Well—!” she breathed ever\nso kindly.\n\n“Well, what?”\n\n“She _is_ free from her chin up,” she mused; “and that _will_ be enough\nfor her.”\n\n“It will be enough for me!” Strether ruefully laughed. “Waymarsh has\nreally,” he then asked, “brought her to see you?”\n\n“Yes—but that’s the worst of it. I could do you no good. And yet I\ntried hard.”\n\nStrether wondered. “And how did you try?”\n\n“Why I didn’t speak of you.”\n\n“I see. That was better.”\n\n“Then what would have been worse? For speaking or silent,” she lightly\nwailed, “I somehow ‘compromise.’ And it has never been any one but\nyou.”\n\n“That shows”—he was magnanimous—“that it’s something not in you, but in\none’s self. It’s _my_ fault.”\n\nShe was silent a little. “No, it’s Mr. Waymarsh’s. It’s the fault of\nhis having brought her.”\n\n“Ah then,” said Strether good-naturedly, “why _did_ he bring her?”\n\n“He couldn’t afford not to.”\n\n“Oh you were a trophy—one of the spoils of conquest? But why in that\ncase, since you do ‘compromise’—”\n\n“Don’t I compromise _him_ as well? I do compromise him as well,” Miss\nBarrace smiled. “I compromise him as hard as I can. But for Mr.\nWaymarsh it isn’t fatal. It’s—so far as his wonderful relation with\nMrs. Pocock is concerned—favourable.” And then, as he still seemed\nslightly at sea: “The man who had succeeded with _me_, don’t you see?\nFor her to get him from me was such an added incentive.”\n\nStrether saw, but as if his path was still strewn with surprises. “It’s\n‘from’ you then that she has got him?”\n\nShe was amused at his momentary muddle. “You can fancy my fight! She\nbelieves in her triumph. I think it has been part of her joy.\n\n“Oh her joy!” Strether sceptically murmured.\n\n“Well, she thinks she has had her own way. And what’s to-night for her\nbut a kind of apotheosis? Her frock’s really good.”\n\n“Good enough to go to heaven in? For after a real apotheosis,” Strether\nwent on, “there’s nothing _but_ heaven. For Sarah there’s only\nto-morrow.”\n\n“And you mean that she won’t find to-morrow heavenly?”\n\n“Well, I mean that I somehow feel to-night—on her behalf—too good to be\ntrue. She has had her cake; that is she’s in the act now of having it,\nof swallowing the largest and sweetest piece. There won’t be another\nleft for her. Certainly _I_ haven’t one. It can only, at the best, be\nChad.” He continued to make it out as for their common entertainment.\n“He may have one, as it were, up his sleeve; yet it’s borne in upon me\nthat if he had—”\n\n“He wouldn’t”—she quite understood—“have taken all _this_ trouble? I\ndare say not, and, if I may be quite free and dreadful, I very much\nhope he won’t take any more. Of course I won’t pretend now,” she added,\n“not to know what it’s a question of.”\n\n“Oh every one must know now,” poor Strether thoughtfully admitted; “and\nit’s strange enough and funny enough that one should feel everybody\nhere at this very moment to be knowing and watching and waiting.”\n\n“Yes—isn’t it indeed funny?” Miss Barrace quite rose to it. “That’s the\nway we _are_ in Paris.” She was always pleased with a new contribution\nto that queerness. “It’s wonderful! But, you know,” she declared, “it\nall depends on you. I don’t want to turn the knife in your vitals, but\nthat’s naturally what you just now meant by our all being on top of\nyou. We know you as the hero of the drama, and we’re gathered to see\nwhat you’ll do.”\n\nStrether looked at her a moment with a light perhaps slightly obscured.\n“I think that must be why the hero has taken refuge in this corner.\nHe’s scared at his heroism—he shrinks from his part.”\n\n“Ah but we nevertheless believe he’ll play it. That’s why,” Miss\nBarrace kindly went on, “we take such an interest in you. We feel\nyou’ll come up to the scratch.” And then as he seemed perhaps not quite\nto take fire: “Don’t let him do it.”\n\n“Don’t let Chad go?”\n\n“Yes, keep hold of him. With all this”—and she indicated the general\ntribute—“he has done enough. We love him here—he’s charming.”\n\n“It’s beautiful,” said Strether, “the way you all can simplify when you\nwill.”\n\nBut she gave it to him back. “It’s nothing to the way _you_ will when\nyou must.”\n\nHe winced at it as at the very voice of prophecy, and it kept him a\nmoment quiet. He detained her, however, on her appearing about to leave\nhim alone in the rather cold clearance their talk had made. “There\npositively isn’t a sign of a hero to-night; the hero’s dodging and\nshirking, the hero’s ashamed. Therefore, you know, I think, what you\nmust all _really_ be occupied with is the heroine.”\n\nMiss Barrace took a minute. “The heroine?”\n\n“The heroine. I’ve treated her,” said Strether, “not a bit like a hero.\nOh,” he sighed, “I don’t do it well!”\n\nShe eased him off. “You do it as you can.” And then after another\nhesitation: “I think she’s satisfied.”\n\nBut he remained compunctious. “I haven’t been near her. I haven’t\nlooked at her.”\n\n“Ah then you’ve lost a good deal!”\n\nHe showed he knew it. “She’s more wonderful than ever?”\n\n“Than ever. With Mr. Pocock.”\n\nStrether wondered. “Madame de Vionnet—with Jim?”\n\n“Madame de Vionnet—with ‘Jim.’” Miss Barrace was historic.\n\n“And what’s she doing with him?”\n\n“Ah you must ask _him!_”\n\nStrether’s face lighted again at the prospect. “It _will_ be amusing to\ndo so.” Yet he continued to wonder. “But she must have some idea.”\n\n“Of course she has—she has twenty ideas. She has in the first place,”\nsaid Miss Barrace, swinging a little her tortoise-shell, “that of doing\nher part. Her part is to help _you_.”\n\nIt came out as nothing had come yet; links were missing and connexions\nunnamed, but it was suddenly as if they were at the heart of their\nsubject. “Yes; how much more she does it,” Strether gravely reflected,\n“than I help _her!_” It all came over him as with the near presence of\nthe beauty, the grace, the intense, dissimulated spirit with which he\nhad, as he said, been putting off contact. “_She_ has courage.”\n\n“Ah she has courage!” Miss Barrace quite agreed; and it was as if for a\nmoment they saw the quantity in each other’s face.\n\nBut indeed the whole thing was present. “How much she must care!”\n\n“Ah there it is. She does care. But it isn’t, is it,” Miss Barrace\nconsiderately added, “as if you had ever had any doubt of that?”\n\nStrether seemed suddenly to like to feel that he really never had. “Why\nof course it’s the whole point.”\n\n“Voilà!” Miss Barrace smiled.\n\n“It’s why one came out,” Strether went on. “And it’s why one has stayed\nso long. And it’s also”—he abounded—“why one’s going home. It’s why,\nit’s why—”\n\n“It’s why everything!” she concurred. “It’s why she might be\nto-night—for all she looks and shows, and for all your friend ‘Jim’\ndoes—about twenty years old. That’s another of her ideas; to be for\nhim, and to be quite easily and charmingly, as young as a little girl.”\n\nStrether assisted at his distance. “‘For him’? For Chad—?”\n\n“For Chad, in a manner, naturally, always. But in particular to-night\nfor Mr. Pocock.” And then as her friend still stared: “Yes, it _is_ of\na bravery! But that’s what she has: her high sense of duty.” It was\nmore than sufficiently before them. “When Mr. Newsome has his hands so\nembarrassed with his sister—”\n\n“It’s quite the least”—Strether filled it out—“that she should take his\nsister’s husband? Certainly—quite the least. So she has taken him.”\n\n“She has taken him.” It was all Miss Barrace had meant.\n\nStill it remained enough. “It must be funny.”\n\n“Oh it _is_ funny.” That of course essentially went with it.\n\nBut it brought them back. “How indeed then she must care!” In answer to\nwhich Strether’s entertainer dropped a comprehensive “Ah!” expressive\nperhaps of some impatience for the time he took to get used to it. She\nherself had got used to it long before.\n\n\n II\n\nWhen one morning within the week he perceived the whole thing to be\nreally at last upon him Strether’s immediate feeling was all relief. He\nhad known this morning that something was about to happen—known it, in\na moment, by Waymarsh’s manner when Waymarsh appeared before him during\nhis brief consumption of coffee and a roll in the small slippery\n_salle-à-manger_ so associated with rich rumination. Strether had taken\nthere of late various lonely and absent-minded meals; he communed\nthere, even at the end of June, with a suspected chill, the air of old\nshivers mixed with old savours, the air in which so many of his\nimpressions had perversely matured; the place meanwhile renewing its\nmessage to him by the very circumstance of his single state. He now sat\nthere, for the most part, to sigh softly, while he vaguely tilted his\ncarafe, over the vision of how much better Waymarsh was occupied. That\nwas really his success by the common measure—to have led this companion\nso on and on. He remembered how at first there had been scarce a\nsquatting-place he could beguile him into passing; the actual outcome\nof which at last was that there was scarce one that could arrest him in\nhis rush. His rush—as Strether vividly and amusedly figured\nit—continued to be all with Sarah, and contained perhaps moreover the\nword of the whole enigma, whipping up in its fine full-flavoured froth\nthe very principle, for good or for ill, of his own, of Strether’s\ndestiny. It might after all, to the end, only be that they had united\nto save him, and indeed, so far as Waymarsh was concerned, that _had_\nto be the spring of action. Strether was glad at all events, in\nconnexion with the case, that the saving he required was not more\nscant; so constituted a luxury was it in certain lights just to lurk\nthere out of the full glare. He had moments of quite seriously\nwondering whether Waymarsh wouldn’t in fact, thanks to old friendship\nand a conceivable indulgence, make about as good terms for him as he\nmight make for himself. They wouldn’t be the same terms of course; but\nthey might have the advantage that he himself probably should be able\nto make none at all.\n\nHe was never in the morning very late, but Waymarsh had already been\nout, and, after a peep into the dim refectory, he presented himself\nwith much less than usual of his large looseness. He had made sure,\nthrough the expanse of glass exposed to the court, that they would be\nalone; and there was now in fact that about him that pretty well took\nup the room. He was dressed in the garments of summer; and save that\nhis white waistcoat was redundant and bulging these things favoured,\nthey determined, his expression. He wore a straw hat such as his friend\nhadn’t yet seen in Paris, and he showed a buttonhole freshly adorned\nwith a magnificent rose. Strether read on the instant his story—how,\nastir for the previous hour, the sprinkled newness of the day, so\npleasant at that season in Paris, he was fairly panting with the pulse\nof adventure and had been with Mrs. Pocock, unmistakeably, to the\nMarché aux Fleurs. Strether really knew in this vision of him a joy\nthat was akin to envy; so reversed as he stood there did their old\npositions seem; so comparatively doleful now showed, by the sharp turn\nof the wheel, the posture of the pilgrim from Woollett. He wondered,\nthis pilgrim, if he had originally looked to Waymarsh so brave and\nwell, so remarkably launched, as it was at present the latter’s\nprivilege to appear. He recalled that his friend had remarked to him\neven at Chester that his aspect belied his plea of prostration; but\nthere certainly couldn’t have been, for an issue, an aspect less\nconcerned than Waymarsh’s with the menace of decay. Strether had at any\nrate never resembled a Southern planter of the great days—which was the\nimage picturesquely suggested by the happy relation between the\nfuliginous face and the wide panama of his visitor. This type, it\nfurther amused him to guess, had been, on Waymarsh’s part, the object\nof Sarah’s care; he was convinced that her taste had not been a\nstranger to the conception and purchase of the hat, any more than her\nfine fingers had been guiltless of the bestowal of the rose. It came to\nhim in the current of thought, as things so oddly did come, that _he_\nhad never risen with the lark to attend a brilliant woman to the Marché\naux Fleurs; this could be fastened on him in connexion neither with\nMiss Gostrey nor with Madame de Vionnet; the practice of getting up\nearly for adventures could indeed in no manner be fastened on him. It\ncame to him in fact that just here was his usual case: he was for ever\nmissing things through his general genius for missing them, while\nothers were for ever picking them up through a contrary bent. And it\nwas others who looked abstemious and he who looked greedy; it was he\nsomehow who finally paid, and it was others who mainly partook. Yes, he\nshould go to the scaffold yet for he wouldn’t know quite whom. He\nalmost, for that matter, felt on the scaffold now and really quite\nenjoying it. It worked out as _because_ he was anxious there—it worked\nout as for this reason that Waymarsh was so blooming. It was _his_ trip\nfor health, for a change, that proved the success—which was just what\nStrether, planning and exerting himself, had desired it should be. That\ntruth already sat full-blown on his companion’s lips; benevolence\nbreathed from them as with the warmth of active exercise, and also a\nlittle as with the bustle of haste.\n\n“Mrs. Pocock, whom I left a quarter of an hour ago at her hotel, has\nasked me to mention to you that she would like to find you at home here\nin about another hour. She wants to see you; she has something to\nsay—or considers, I believe, that you may have: so that I asked her\nmyself why she shouldn’t come right round. She hasn’t _been_ round\nyet—to see our place; and I took upon myself to say that I was sure\nyou’d be glad to have her. The thing’s therefore, you see, to keep\nright here till she comes.”\n\nThe announcement was sociably, even though, after Waymarsh’s wont,\nsomewhat solemnly made; but Strether quickly felt other things in it\nthan these light features. It was the first approach, from that\nquarter, to admitted consciousness; it quickened his pulse; it simply\nmeant at last that he should have but himself to thank if he didn’t\nknow where he was. He had finished his breakfast; he pushed it away and\nwas on his feet. There were plenty of elements of surprise, but only\none of doubt. “The thing’s for _you_ to keep here too?” Waymarsh had\nbeen slightly ambiguous.\n\nHe wasn’t ambiguous, however, after this enquiry; and Strether’s\nunderstanding had probably never before opened so wide and effective a\nmouth as it was to open during the next five minutes. It was no part of\nhis friend’s wish, as appeared, to help to receive Mrs. Pocock; he\nquite understood the spirit in which she was to present herself, but\nhis connexion with her visit was limited to his having—well, as he\nmight say—perhaps a little promoted it. He had thought, and had let her\nknow it, that Strether possibly would think she might have been round\nbefore. At any rate, as turned out, she had been wanting herself, quite\na while, to come. “I told her,” said Waymarsh, “that it would have been\na bright idea if she had only carried it out before.”\n\nStrether pronounced it so bright as to be almost dazzling. “But why\n_hasn’t_ she carried it out before? She has seen me every day—she had\nonly to name her hour. I’ve been waiting and waiting.”\n\n“Well, I told her you had. And she has been waiting too.” It was, in\nthe oddest way in the world, on the showing of this tone, a genial new\npressing coaxing Waymarsh; a Waymarsh conscious with a different\nconsciousness from any he had yet betrayed, and actually rendered by it\nalmost insinuating. He lacked only time for full persuasion, and\nStrether was to see in a moment why. Meantime, however, our friend\nperceived, he was announcing a step of some magnanimity on Mrs.\nPocock’s part, so that he could deprecate a sharp question. It was his\nown high purpose in fact to have smoothed sharp questions to rest. He\nlooked his old comrade very straight in the eyes, and he had never\nconveyed to him in so mute a manner so much kind confidence and so much\ngood advice. Everything that was between them was again in his face,\nbut matured and shelved and finally disposed of. “At any rate,” he\nadded, “she’s coming now.”\n\nConsidering how many pieces had to fit themselves, it all fell, in\nStrether’s brain, into a close rapid order. He saw on the spot what had\nhappened, and what probably would yet; and it was all funny enough. It\nwas perhaps just this freedom of appreciation that wound him up to his\nflare of high spirits. “What is she coming _for?_—to kill me?”\n\n“She’s coming to be very _very_ kind to you, and you must let me say\nthat I greatly hope you’ll not be less so to herself.”\n\nThis was spoken by Waymarsh with much gravity of admonition, and as\nStrether stood there he knew he had but to make a movement to take the\nattitude of a man gracefully receiving a present. The present was that\nof the opportunity dear old Waymarsh had flattered himself he had\ndivined in him the slight soreness of not having yet thoroughly\nenjoyed; so he had brought it to him thus, as on a little silver\nbreakfast-tray, familiarly though delicately—without oppressive pomp;\nand he was to bend and smile and acknowledge, was to take and use and\nbe grateful. He was not—that was the beauty of it—to be asked to\ndeflect too much from his dignity. No wonder the old boy bloomed in\nthis bland air of his own distillation. Strether felt for a moment as\nif Sarah were actually walking up and down outside. Wasn’t she hanging\nabout the _porte-cochère_ while her friend thus summarily opened a way?\nStrether would meet her but to take it, and everything would be for the\nbest in the best of possible worlds. He had never so much known what\nany one meant as, in the light of this demonstration, he knew what Mrs.\nNewsome did. It had reached Waymarsh from Sarah, but it had reached\nSarah from her mother, and there was no break in the chain by which it\nreached _him_. “Has anything particular happened,” he asked after a\nminute—“so suddenly to determine her? Has she heard anything unexpected\nfrom home?”\n\nWaymarsh, on this, it seemed to him, looked at him harder than ever.\n“‘Unexpected’?” He had a brief hesitation; then, however, he was firm.\n“We’re leaving Paris.”\n\n“Leaving? That _is_ sudden.”\n\nWaymarsh showed a different opinion. “Less so than it may seem. The\npurpose of Mrs. Pocock’s visit is to explain to you in fact that it’s\n_not_.”\n\nStrether didn’t at all know if he had really an advantage—anything that\nwould practically count as one; but he enjoyed for the moment—as for\nthe first time in his life—the sense of so carrying it off. He\nwondered—it was amusing—if he felt as the impudent feel. “I shall take\ngreat pleasure, I assure you, in any explanation. I shall be delighted\nto receive Sarah.”\n\nThe sombre glow just darkened in his comrade’s eyes; but he was struck\nwith the way it died out again. It was too mixed with another\nconsciousness—it was too smothered, as might be said, in flowers. He\nreally for the time regretted it—poor dear old sombre glow! Something\nstraight and simple, something heavy and empty, had been eclipsed in\nits company; something by which he had best known his friend. Waymarsh\nwouldn’t _be_ his friend, somehow, without the occasional ornament of\nthe sacred rage, and the right to the sacred rage—inestimably precious\nfor Strether’s charity—he also seemed in a manner, and at Mrs. Pocock’s\nelbow, to have forfeited. Strether remembered the occasion early in\ntheir stay when on that very spot he had come out with his earnest, his\nominous “Quit it!”—and, so remembering, felt it hang by a hair that he\ndidn’t himself now utter the same note. Waymarsh was having a good\ntime—this was the truth that was embarrassing for him, and he was\nhaving it then and there, he was having it in Europe, he was having it\nunder the very protection of circumstances of which he didn’t in the\nleast approve; all of which placed him in a false position, with no\nissue possible—none at least by the grand manner. It was practically in\nthe manner of any one—it was all but in poor Strether’s own—that\ninstead of taking anything up he merely made the most of having to be\nhimself explanatory. “I’m not leaving for the United States direct. Mr.\nand Mrs. Pocock and Miss Mamie are thinking of a little trip before\ntheir own return, and we’ve been talking for some days past of our\njoining forces. We’ve settled it that we do join and that we sail\ntogether the end of next month. But we start to-morrow for Switzerland.\nMrs. Pocock wants some scenery. She hasn’t had much yet.”\n\nHe was brave in his way too, keeping nothing back, confessing all there\nwas, and only leaving Strether to make certain connexions. “Is what\nMrs. Newsome had cabled her daughter an injunction to break off short?”\n\nThe grand manner indeed at this just raised its head a little. “I know\nnothing about Mrs. Newsome’s cables.”\n\nTheir eyes met on it with some intensity—during the few seconds of\nwhich something happened quite out of proportion to the time. It\nhappened that Strether, looking thus at his friend, didn’t take his\nanswer for truth—and that something more again occurred in consequence\nof _that_. Yes—Waymarsh just _did_ know about Mrs. Newsome’s cables: to\nwhat other end than that had they dined together at Bignon’s? Strether\nalmost felt for the instant that it was to Mrs. Newsome herself the\ndinner had been given; and, for that matter, quite felt how she must\nhave known about it and, as he might think, protected and consecrated\nit. He had a quick blurred view of daily cables, questions, answers,\nsignals: clear enough was his vision of the expense that, when so wound\nup, the lady at home was prepared to incur. Vivid not less was his\nmemory of what, during his long observation of her, some of her\nattainments of that high pitch had cost her. Distinctly she was at the\nhighest now, and Waymarsh, who imagined himself an independent\nperformer, was really, forcing his fine old natural voice, an\noverstrained accompanist. The whole reference of his errand seemed to\nmark her for Strether as by this time consentingly familiar to him, and\nnothing yet had so despoiled her of a special shade of consideration.\n“You don’t know,” he asked, “whether Sarah has been directed from home\nto try me on the matter of my also going to Switzerland?”\n\n“I know,” said Waymarsh as manfully as possible, “nothing whatever\nabout her private affairs; though I believe her to be acting in\nconformity with things that have my highest respect.” It was as manful\nas possible, but it was still the false note—as it had to be to convey\nso sorry a statement. He knew everything, Strether more and more felt,\nthat he thus disclaimed, and his little punishment was just in this\ndoom to a second fib. What falser position—given the man—could the most\nvindictive mind impose? He ended by squeezing through a passage in\nwhich three months before he would certainly have stuck fast. “Mrs\nPocock will probably be ready herself to answer any enquiry you may put\nto her. But,” he continued, “_but_—!” He faltered on it.\n\n“But what? Don’t put her too many?”\n\nWaymarsh looked large, but the harm was done; he couldn’t, do what he\nwould, help looking rosy. “Don’t do anything you’ll be sorry for.”\n\nIt was an attenuation, Strether guessed, of something else that had\nbeen on his lips; it was a sudden drop to directness, and was thereby\nthe voice of sincerity. He had fallen to the supplicating note, and\nthat immediately, for our friend, made a difference and reinstated him.\nThey were in communication as they had been, that first morning, in\nSarah’s salon and in her presence and Madame de Vionnet’s; and the same\nrecognition of a great good will was again, after all, possible. Only\nthe amount of response Waymarsh had then taken for granted was doubled,\ndecupled now. This came out when he presently said: “Of course I\nneedn’t assure you _I_ hope you’ll come with us.” Then it was that his\nimplications and expectations loomed up for Strether as almost\npathetically gross.\n\nThe latter patted his shoulder while he thanked him, giving the go-by\nto the question of joining the Pococks; he expressed the joy he felt at\nseeing him go forth again so brave and free, and he in fact almost took\nleave of him on the spot. “I shall see you again of course before you\ngo; but I’m meanwhile much obliged to you for arranging so conveniently\nfor what you’ve told me. I shall walk up and down in the court\nthere—dear little old court which we’ve each bepaced so, this last\ncouple of months, to the tune of our flights and our drops, our\nhesitations and our plunges: I shall hang about there, all impatience\nand excitement, please let Sarah know, till she graciously presents\nherself. Leave me with her without fear,” he laughed; “I assure you I\nshan’t hurt her. I don’t think either she’ll hurt _me_: I’m in a\nsituation in which damage was some time ago discounted. Besides, _that_\nisn’t what worries you—but don’t, don’t explain! We’re all right as we\nare: which was the degree of success our adventure was pledged to for\neach of us. We weren’t, it seemed, all right as we were before; and\nwe’ve got over the ground, all things considered, quickly. I hope\nyou’ll have a lovely time in the Alps.”\n\nWaymarsh fairly looked up at him as from the foot of them. “I don’t\nknow as I _ought_ really to go.”\n\nIt was the conscience of Milrose in the very voice of Milrose, but, oh\nit was feeble and flat! Strether suddenly felt quite ashamed for him;\nhe breathed a greater boldness. “_Let_ yourself, on the contrary, go—in\nall agreeable directions. These are precious hours—at our age they\nmayn’t recur. Don’t have it to say to yourself at Milrose, next winter,\nthat you hadn’t courage for them.” And then as his comrade queerly\nstared: “Live up to Mrs. Pocock.”\n\n“Live up to her?”\n\n“You’re a great help to her.”\n\nWaymarsh looked at it as at one of the uncomfortable things that were\ncertainly true and that it was yet ironical to say. “It’s more then\nthan you are.”\n\n“That’s exactly your own chance and advantage. Besides,” said Strether,\n“I do in my way contribute. I know what I’m about.”\n\nWaymarsh had kept on his great panama, and, as he now stood nearer the\ndoor, his last look beneath the shade of it had turned again to\ndarkness and warning. “So do I! See here, Strether.”\n\n“I know what you’re going to say. ‘Quit this’?”\n\n“Quit this!” But it lacked its old intensity; nothing of it remained;\nit went out of the room with him.\n\n\n III\n\nAlmost the first thing, strangely enough, that, about an hour later,\nStrether found himself doing in Sarah’s presence was to remark\narticulately on this failure, in their friend, of what had been\nsuperficially his great distinction. It was as if—he alluded of course\nto the grand manner—the dear man had sacrificed it to some other\nadvantage; which would be of course only for himself to measure. It\nmight be simply that he was physically so much more sound than on his\nfirst coming out; this was all prosaic, comparatively cheerful and\nvulgar. And fortunately, if one came to that, his improvement in health\nwas really itself grander than any manner it could be conceived as\nhaving cost him. “You yourself alone, dear Sarah”—Strether took the\nplunge—“have done him, it strikes me, in these three weeks, as much\ngood as all the rest of his time together.”\n\nIt was a plunge because somehow the range of reference was, in the\nconditions, “funny,” and made funnier still by Sarah’s attitude, by the\nturn the occasion had, with her appearance, so sensibly taken. Her\nappearance was really indeed funnier than anything else—the spirit in\nwhich he felt her to be there as soon as she was there, the shade of\nobscurity that cleared up for him as soon as he was seated with her in\nthe small _salon de lecture_ that had, for the most part, in all the\nweeks, witnessed the wane of his early vivacity of discussion with\nWaymarsh. It was an immense thing, quite a tremendous thing, for her to\nhave come: this truth opened out to him in spite of his having already\narrived for himself at a fairly vivid view of it. He had done exactly\nwhat he had given Waymarsh his word for—had walked and re-walked the\ncourt while he awaited her advent; acquiring in this exercise an amount\nof light that affected him at the time as flooding the scene. She had\ndecided upon the step in order to give him the benefit of a doubt, in\norder to be able to say to her mother that she had, even to abjectness,\nsmoothed the way for him. The doubt had been as to whether he mightn’t\ntake her as not having smoothed it—and the admonition had possibly come\nfrom Waymarsh’s more detached spirit. Waymarsh had at any rate,\ncertainly, thrown his weight into the scale—he had pointed to the\nimportance of depriving their friend of a grievance. She had done\njustice to the plea, and it was to set herself right with a high ideal\nthat she actually sat there in her state. Her calculation was sharp in\nthe immobility with which she held her tall parasol-stick upright and\nat arm’s length, quite as if she had struck the place to plant her\nflag; in the separate precautions she took not to show as nervous; in\nthe aggressive repose in which she did quite nothing but wait for him.\nDoubt ceased to be possible from the moment he had taken in that she\nhad arrived with no proposal whatever; that her concern was simply to\nshow what she had come to receive. She had come to receive his\nsubmission, and Waymarsh was to have made it plain to him that she\nwould expect nothing less. He saw fifty things, her host, at this\nconvenient stage; but one of those he most saw was that their anxious\nfriend hadn’t quite had the hand required of him. Waymarsh _had_,\nhowever, uttered the request that she might find him mild, and while\nhanging about the court before her arrival he had turned over with zeal\nthe different ways in which he could be so. The difficulty was that if\nhe was mild he wasn’t, for her purpose, conscious. If she wished him\nconscious—as everything about her cried aloud that she did—she must\naccordingly be at costs to make him so. Conscious he _was_, for\nhimself—but only of too many things; so she must choose the one she\nrequired.\n\nPractically, however, it at last got itself named, and when once that\nhad happened they were quite at the centre of their situation. One\nthing had really done as well as another; when Strether had spoken of\nWaymarsh’s leaving him, and that had necessarily brought on a reference\nto Mrs. Pocock’s similar intention, the jump was but short to supreme\nlucidity. Light became indeed after that so intense that Strether would\ndoubtless have but half made out, in the prodigious glare, by which of\nthe two the issue had been in fact precipitated. It was, in their\ncontracted quarters, as much there between them as if it had been\nsomething suddenly spilled with a crash and a splash on the floor. The\nform of his submission was to be an engagement to acquit himself within\nthe twenty-four hours. “He’ll go in a moment if you give him the\nword—he assures me on his honour he’ll do that”: this came in its\norder, out of its order, in respect to Chad, after the crash had\noccurred. It came repeatedly during the time taken by Strether to feel\nthat he was even more fixed in his rigour than he had supposed—the time\nhe was not above adding to a little by telling her that such a way of\nputting it on her brother’s part left him sufficiently surprised. She\nwasn’t at all funny at last—she was really fine; and he felt easily\nwhere she was strong—strong for herself. It hadn’t yet so come home to\nhim that she was nobly and appointedly officious. She was acting in\ninterests grander and clearer than that of her poor little personal,\npoor little Parisian equilibrium, and all his consciousness of her\nmother’s moral pressure profited by this proof of its sustaining force.\nShe would be held up; she would be strengthened; he needn’t in the\nleast be anxious for her. What would once more have been distinct to\nhim had he tried to make it so was that, as Mrs. Newsome was\nessentially all moral pressure, the presence of this element was almost\nidentical with her own presence. It wasn’t perhaps that he felt he was\ndealing with her straight, but it was certainly as if she had been\ndealing straight with _him_. She was reaching him somehow by the\nlengthened arm of the spirit, and he was having to that extent to take\nher into account; but he wasn’t reaching her in turn, not making her\ntake _him_; he was only reaching Sarah, who appeared to take so little\nof him. “Something has clearly passed between you and Chad,” he\npresently said, “that I think I ought to know something more about.\nDoes he put it all,” he smiled, “on me?”\n\n“Did you come out,” she asked, “to put it all on _him?_”\n\nBut he replied to this no further than, after an instant, by saying:\n“Oh it’s all right. Chad I mean’s all right in having said to you—well\nanything he may have said. I’ll _take_ it all—what he does put on me.\nOnly I must see him before I see you again.”\n\nShe hesitated, but she brought it out. “Is it absolutely necessary you\nshould see me again?”\n\n“Certainly, if I’m to give you any definite word about anything.”\n\n“Is it your idea then,” she returned, “that I shall keep on meeting you\nonly to be exposed to fresh humiliation?”\n\nHe fixed her a longer time. “Are your instructions from Mrs. Newsome\nthat you shall, even at the worst, absolutely and irretrievably break\nwith me?”\n\n“My instructions from Mrs. Newsome are, if you please, my affair. You\nknow perfectly what your own were, and you can judge for yourself of\nwhat it can do for you to have made what you have of them. You can\nperfectly see, at any rate, I’ll go so far as to say, that if I wish\nnot to expose myself I must wish still less to expose _her_.” She had\nalready said more than she had quite expected; but, though she had also\npulled up, the colour in her face showed him he should from one moment\nto the other have it all. He now indeed felt the high importance of his\nhaving it. “What is your conduct,” she broke out as if to explain—“what\nis your conduct but an outrage to women like _us?_ I mean your acting\nas if there can be a doubt—as between us and such another—of his duty?”\n\nHe thought a moment. It was rather much to deal with at once; not only\nthe question itself, but the sore abysses it revealed. “Of course\nthey’re totally different kinds of duty.”\n\n“And do you pretend that he has any at all—to such another?”\n\n“Do you mean to Madame de Vionnet?” He uttered the name not to affront\nher, but yet again to gain time—time that he needed for taking in\nsomething still other and larger than her demand of a moment before. It\nwasn’t at once that he could see all that was in her actual challenge;\nbut when he did he found himself just checking a low vague sound, a\nsound which was perhaps the nearest approach his vocal chords had ever\nknown to a growl. Everything Mrs. Pocock had failed to give a sign of\nrecognising in Chad as a particular part of a transformation—everything\nthat had lent intention to this particular failure—affected him as\ngathered into a large loose bundle and thrown, in her words, into his\nface. The missile made him to that extent catch his breath; which\nhowever he presently recovered. “Why when a woman’s at once so charming\nand so beneficent—”\n\n“You can sacrifice mothers and sisters to her without a blush and can\nmake them cross the ocean on purpose to feel the more and take from you\nthe straighter, _how_ you do it?”\n\nYes, she had taken him up as short and as sharply as that, but he tried\nnot to flounder in her grasp. “I don’t think there’s anything I’ve done\nin any such calculated way as you describe. Everything has come as a\nsort of indistinguishable part of everything else. Your coming out\nbelonged closely to my having come before you, and my having come was a\nresult of our general state of mind. Our general state of mind had\nproceeded, on its side, from our queer ignorance, our queer\nmisconceptions and confusions—from which, since then, an inexorable\ntide of light seems to have floated us into our perhaps still queerer\nknowledge. Don’t you _like_ your brother as he is,” he went on, “and\nhaven’t you given your mother an intelligible account of all that that\ncomes to?”\n\nIt put to her also, doubtless, his own tone, too many things, this at\nleast would have been the case hadn’t his final challenge directly\nhelped her. Everything, at the stage they had reached, directly helped\nher, because everything betrayed in him such a basis of intention. He\nsaw—the odd way things came out!—that he would have been held less\nmonstrous had he only been a little wilder. What exposed him was just\nhis poor old trick of quiet inwardness, what exposed him was his\n_thinking_ such offence. He hadn’t in the least however the desire to\nirritate that Sarah imputed to him, and he could only at last\ntemporise, for the moment, with her indignant view. She was altogether\nmore inflamed than he had expected, and he would probably understand\nthis better when he should learn what had occurred for her with Chad.\nTill then her view of his particular blackness, her clear surprise at\nhis not clutching the pole she held out, must pass as extravagant. “I\nleave you to flatter yourself,” she returned, “that what you speak of\nis what _you’ve_ beautifully done. When a thing has been already\ndescribed in such a lovely way—!” But she caught herself up, and her\ncomment on his description rang out sufficiently loud. “Do you consider\nher even an apology for a decent woman?”\n\nAh there it was at last! She put the matter more crudely than, for his\nown mixed purposes, he had yet had to do; but essentially it was all\none matter. It was so much—so much; and she treated it, poor lady, as\nso little. He grew conscious, as he was now apt to do, of a strange\nsmile, and the next moment he found himself talking like Miss Barrace.\n“She has struck me from the first as wonderful. I’ve been thinking too\nmoreover that, after all, she would probably have represented even for\nyourself something rather new and rather good.”\n\nHe was to have given Mrs. Pocock with this, however, but her best\nopportunity for a sound of derision. “Rather new? I hope so with all my\nheart!”\n\n“I mean,” he explained, “that she might have affected you by her\nexquisite amiability—a real revelation, it has seemed to myself; her\nhigh rarity, her distinction of every sort.”\n\nHe had been, with these words, consciously a little “precious”; but he\nhad had to be—he couldn’t give her the truth of the case without them;\nand it seemed to him moreover now that he didn’t care. He had at all\nevents not served his cause, for she sprang at its exposed side. “A\n‘revelation’—to _me_: I’ve come to such a woman for a revelation? You\ntalk to me about ‘distinction’—_you_, you who’ve had your\nprivilege?—when the most distinguished woman we shall either of us have\nseen in this world sits there insulted, in her loneliness, by your\nincredible comparison!”\n\nStrether forbore, with an effort, from straying; but he looked all\nabout him. “Does your mother herself make the point that she sits\ninsulted?”\n\nSarah’s answer came so straight, so “pat,” as might have been said,\nthat he felt on the instant its origin. “She has confided to my\njudgement and my tenderness the expression of her personal sense of\neverything, and the assertion of her personal dignity.”\n\nThey were the very words of the lady of Woollett—he would have known\nthem in a thousand; her parting charge to her child. Mrs. Pocock\naccordingly spoke to this extent by book, and the fact immensely moved\nhim. “If she does really feel as you say it’s of course very very\ndreadful. I’ve given sufficient proof, one would have thought,” he\nadded, “of my deep admiration for Mrs. Newsome.”\n\n“And pray what proof would one have thought you’d _call_ sufficient?\nThat of thinking this person here so far superior to her?”\n\nHe wondered again; he waited. “Ah dear Sarah, you must _leave_ me this\nperson here!”\n\nIn his desire to avoid all vulgar retorts, to show how, even\nperversely, he clung to his rag of reason, he had softly almost wailed\nthis plea. Yet he knew it to be perhaps the most positive declaration\nhe had ever made in his life, and his visitor’s reception of it\nvirtually gave it that importance. “That’s exactly what I’m delighted\nto do. God knows _we_ don’t want her! You take good care not to meet,”\nshe observed in a still higher key, “my question about their life. If\nyou do consider it a thing one can even _speak_ of, I congratulate you\non your taste!”\n\nThe life she alluded to was of course Chad’s and Madame de Vionnet’s,\nwhich she thus bracketed together in a way that made him wince a\nlittle; there being nothing for him but to take home her full\nintention. It was none the less his inconsequence that while he had\nhimself been enjoying for weeks the view of the brilliant woman’s\nspecific action, he just suffered from any characterisation of it by\nother lips. “I think tremendously well of her, at the same time that I\nseem to feel her ‘life’ to be really none of my business. It’s my\nbusiness, that is, only so far as Chad’s own life is affected by it;\nand what has happened, don’t you see? is that Chad’s has been affected\nso beautifully. The proof of the pudding’s in the eating”—he tried,\nwith no great success, to help it out with a touch of pleasantry, while\nshe let him go on as if to sink and sink. He went on however well\nenough, as well as he could do without fresh counsel; he indeed\nshouldn’t stand quite firm, he felt, till he should have re-established\nhis communications with Chad. Still, he could always speak for the\nwoman he had so definitely promised to “save.” This wasn’t quite for\nher the air of salvation; but as that chill fairly deepened what did it\nbecome but a reminder that one might at the worst perish _with_ her?\nAnd it was simple enough—it was rudimentary: not, not to give her away.\n“I find in her more merits than you would probably have patience with\nmy counting over. And do you know,” he enquired, “the effect you\nproduce on me by alluding to her in such terms? It’s as if you had some\nmotive in not recognising all she has done for your brother, and so\nshut your eyes to each side of the matter, in order, whichever side\ncomes up, to get rid of the other. I don’t, you must allow me to say,\nsee how you can with any pretence to candour get rid of the side\nnearest you.”\n\n“Near me—_that_ sort of thing?” And Sarah gave a jerk back of her head\nthat well might have nullified any active proximity.\n\nIt kept her friend himself at his distance, and he respected for a\nmoment the interval. Then with a last persuasive effort he bridged it.\n“You don’t, on your honour, appreciate Chad’s fortunate development?”\n\n“Fortunate?” she echoed again. And indeed she was prepared. “I call it\nhideous.”\n\nHer departure had been for some minutes marked as imminent, and she was\nalready at the door that stood open to the court, from the threshold of\nwhich she delivered herself of this judgement. It rang out so loud as\nto produce for the time the hush of everything else. Strether quite, as\nan effect of it, breathed less bravely; he could acknowledge it, but\nsimply enough. “Oh if you think _that_—!”\n\n“Then all’s at an end? So much the better. I do think that!” She passed\nout as she spoke and took her way straight across the court, beyond\nwhich, separated from them by the deep arch of the _porte-cochère_ the\nlow victoria that had conveyed her from her own hotel was drawn up. She\nmade for it with decision, and the manner of her break, the sharp shaft\nof her rejoinder, had an intensity by which Strether was at first kept\nin arrest. She had let fly at him as from a stretched cord, and it took\nhim a minute to recover from the sense of being pierced. It was not the\npenetration of surprise; it was that, much more, of certainty; his case\nbeing put for him as he had as yet only put it to himself. She was away\nat any rate; she had distanced him—with rather a grand spring, an\neffect of pride and ease, after all; she had got into her carriage\nbefore he could overtake her, and the vehicle was already in motion. He\nstopped halfway; he stood there in the court only seeing her go and\nnoting that she gave him no other look. The way he had put it to\nhimself was that all quite _might_ be at an end. Each of her movements,\nin this resolute rupture, reaffirmed, re-enforced that idea. Sarah\npassed out of sight in the sunny street while, planted there in the\ncentre of the comparatively grey court, he continued merely to look\nbefore him. It probably _was_ all at an end.\n\n\nBook Eleventh\n\n\n [Note: In the 1909 New York Edition the following two chapters were\n placed in the reverse of the order appearing below.

Hathaway, preparer of this\n electronic text]\n\n\n I\n\nHe went late that evening to the Boulevard Malesherbes, having his\nimpression that it would be vain to go early, and having also, more\nthan once in the course of the day, made enquiries of the concierge.\nChad hadn’t come in and had left no intimation; he had affairs,\napparently, at this juncture—as it occurred to Strether he so well\nmight have—that kept him long abroad. Our friend asked once for him at\nthe hotel in the Rue de Rivoli, but the only contribution offered there\nwas the fact that every one was out. It was with the idea that he would\nhave to come home to sleep that Strether went up to his rooms, from\nwhich however he was still absent, though, from the balcony, a few\nmoments later, his visitor heard eleven o’clock strike. Chad’s servant\nhad by this time answered for his reappearance; he _had_, the visitor\nlearned, come quickly in to dress for dinner and vanish again. Strether\nspent an hour in waiting for him—an hour full of strange suggestions,\npersuasions, recognitions; one of those that he was to recall, at the\nend of his adventure, as the particular handful that most had counted.\nThe mellowest lamplight and the easiest chair had been placed at his\ndisposal by Baptiste, subtlest of servants; the novel half-uncut, the\nnovel lemon-coloured and tender, with the ivory knife athwart it like\nthe dagger in a contadina’s hair, had been pushed within the soft\ncircle—a circle which, for some reason, affected Strether as softer\nstill after the same Baptiste had remarked that in the absence of a\nfurther need of anything by Monsieur he would betake himself to bed.\nThe night was hot and heavy and the single lamp sufficient; the great\nflare of the lighted city, rising high, spending itself afar, played up\nfrom the Boulevard and, through the vague vista of the successive\nrooms, brought objects into view and added to their dignity. Strether\nfound himself in possession as he never yet had been; he had been there\nalone, had turned over books and prints, had invoked, in Chad’s\nabsence, the spirit of the place, but never at the witching hour and\nnever with a relish quite so like a pang.\n\nHe spent a long time on the balcony; he hung over it as he had seen\nlittle Bilham hang the day of his first approach, as he had seen Mamie\nhang over her own the day little Bilham himself might have seen her\nfrom below; he passed back into the rooms, the three that occupied the\nfront and that communicated by wide doors; and, while he circulated and\nrested, tried to recover the impression that they had made on him three\nmonths before, to catch again the voice in which they had seemed then\nto speak to him. That voice, he had to note, failed audibly to sound;\nwhich he took as the proof of all the change in himself. He had heard,\nof old, only what he _could_ then hear; what he could do now was to\nthink of three months ago as a point in the far past. All voices had\ngrown thicker and meant more things; they crowded on him as he moved\nabout—it was the way they sounded together that wouldn’t let him be\nstill. He felt, strangely, as sad as if he had come for some wrong, and\nyet as excited as if he had come for some freedom. But the freedom was\nwhat was most in the place and the hour, it was the freedom that most\nbrought him round again to the youth of his own that he had long ago\nmissed. He could have explained little enough to-day either why he had\nmissed it or why, after years and years, he should care that he had;\nthe main truth of the actual appeal of everything was none the less\nthat everything represented the substance of his loss put it within\nreach, within touch, made it, to a degree it had never been, an affair\nof the senses. That was what it became for him at this singular time,\nthe youth he had long ago missed—a queer concrete presence, full of\nmystery, yet full of reality, which he could handle, taste, smell, the\ndeep breathing of which he could positively hear. It was in the outside\nair as well as within; it was in the long watch, from the balcony, in\nthe summer night, of the wide late life of Paris, the unceasing soft\nquick rumble, below, of the little lighted carriages that, in the\npress, always suggested the gamblers he had seen of old at Monte Carlo\npushing up to the tables. This image was before him when he at last\nbecame aware that Chad was behind.\n\n“She tells me you put it all on _me_”—he had arrived after this\npromptly enough at that information; which expressed the case however\nquite as the young man appeared willing for the moment to leave it.\nOther things, with this advantage of their virtually having the night\nbefore them, came up for them, and had, as well, the odd effect of\nmaking the occasion, instead of hurried and feverish, one of the\nlargest, loosest and easiest to which Strether’s whole adventure was to\nhave treated him. He had been pursuing Chad from an early hour and had\novertaken him only now; but now the delay was repaired by their being\nso exceptionally confronted. They had foregathered enough of course in\nall the various times; they had again and again, since that first night\nat the theatre, been face to face over their question; but they had\nnever been so alone together as they were actually alone—their talk\nhadn’t yet been so supremely for themselves. And if many things\nmoreover passed before them, none passed more distinctly for Strether\nthan that striking truth about Chad of which he had been so often moved\nto take note: the truth that everything came happily back with him to\nhis knowing how to live. It had been seated in his pleased smile—a\nsmile that pleased exactly in the right degree—as his visitor turned\nround, on the balcony, to greet his advent; his visitor in fact felt on\nthe spot that there was nothing their meeting would so much do as bear\nwitness to that facility. He surrendered himself accordingly to so\napproved a gift; for what was the meaning of the facility but that\nothers _did_ surrender themselves? He didn’t want, luckily, to prevent\nChad from living; but he was quite aware that even if he had he would\nhimself have thoroughly gone to pieces. It was in truth essentially by\nbringing down his personal life to a function all subsidiary to the\nyoung man’s own that he held together. And the great point, above all,\nthe sign of how completely Chad possessed the knowledge in question,\nwas that one thus became, not only with a proper cheerfulness, but with\nwild native impulses, the feeder of his stream. Their talk had\naccordingly not lasted three minutes without Strether’s feeling basis\nenough for the excitement in which he had waited. This overflow fairly\ndeepened, wastefully abounded, as he observed the smallness of anything\ncorresponding to it on the part of his friend. That was exactly this\nfriend’s happy case; he “put out” his excitement, or whatever other\nemotion the matter involved, as he put out his washing; than which no\narrangement could make more for domestic order. It was quite for\nStrether himself in short to feel a personal analogy with the laundress\nbringing home the triumphs of the mangle.\n\nWhen he had reported on Sarah’s visit, which he did very fully, Chad\nanswered his question with perfect candour. “I positively referred her\nto you—told her she must absolutely see you. This was last night, and\nit all took place in ten minutes. It was our first free talk—really the\nfirst time she had tackled me. She knew I also knew what her line had\nbeen with yourself; knew moreover how little you had been doing to make\nanything difficult for her. So I spoke for you frankly—assured her you\nwere all at her service. I assured her _I_ was too,” the young man\ncontinued; “and I pointed out how she could perfectly, at any time,\nhave got at me. Her difficulty has been simply her not finding the\nmoment she fancied.”\n\n“Her difficulty,” Strether returned, “has been simply that she finds\nshe’s afraid of you. She’s not afraid of _me_, Sarah, one little scrap;\nand it was just because she has seen how I can fidget when I give my\nmind to it that she has felt her best chance, rightly enough to be in\nmaking me as uneasy as possible. I think she’s at bottom as pleased to\n_have_ you put it on me as you yourself can possibly be to put it.”\n\n“But what in the world, my dear man,” Chad enquired in objection to\nthis luminosity, “have I done to make Sally afraid?”\n\n“You’ve been ‘wonderful, wonderful,’ as we say—we poor people who watch\nthe play from the pit; and that’s what has, admirably, made her. Made\nher all the more effectually that she could see you didn’t set about it\non purpose—I mean set about affecting her as with fear.”\n\nChad cast a pleasant backward glance over his possibilities of motive.\n“I’ve only wanted to be kind and friendly, to be decent and\nattentive—and I still only want to be.”\n\nStrether smiled at his comfortable clearness. “Well, there can\ncertainly be no way for it better than by my taking the onus. It\nreduces your personal friction and your personal offence to almost\nnothing.”\n\nAh but Chad, with his completer conception of the friendly, wouldn’t\nquite have this! They had remained on the balcony, where, after their\nday of great and premature heat, the midnight air was delicious; and\nthey leaned back in turn against the balustrade, all in harmony with\nthe chairs and the flower-pots, the cigarettes and the starlight. “The\nonus isn’t _really_ yours—after our agreeing so to wait together and\njudge together. That was all my answer to Sally,” Chad pursued—“that we\nhave been, that we are, just judging together.”\n\n“I’m not afraid of the burden,” Strether explained; “I haven’t come in\nthe least that you should take it off me. I’ve come very much, it seems\nto me, to double up my fore legs in the manner of the camel when he\ngets down on his knees to make his back convenient. But I’ve supposed\nyou all this while to have been doing a lot of special and private\njudging—about which I haven’t troubled you; and I’ve only wished to\nhave your conclusion first from you. I don’t ask more than that; I’m\nquite ready to take it as it has come.”\n\nChad turned up his face to the sky with a slow puff of his smoke.\n“Well, I’ve seen.”\n\nStrether waited a little. “I’ve left you wholly alone; haven’t, I think\nI may say, since the first hour or two—when I merely preached\npatience—so much as breathed on you.”\n\n“Oh you’ve been awfully good!”\n\n“We’ve both been good then—we’ve played the game. We’ve given them the\nmost liberal conditions.”\n\n“Ah,” said Chad, “splendid conditions! It was open to them, open to\nthem”—he seemed to make it out, as he smoked, with his eyes still on\nthe stars. He might in quiet sport have been reading their horoscope.\nStrether wondered meanwhile what had been open to them, and he finally\nlet him have it. “It was open to them simply to let me alone; to have\nmade up their minds, on really seeing me for themselves, that I could\ngo on well enough as I was.”\n\nStrether assented to this proposition with full lucidity, his\ncompanion’s plural pronoun, which stood all for Mrs. Newsome and her\ndaughter, having no ambiguity for him. There was nothing, apparently,\nto stand for Mamie and Jim; and this added to our friend’s sense of\nChad’s knowing what he thought. “But they’ve made up their minds to the\nopposite—that you _can’t_ go on as you are.”\n\n“No,” Chad continued in the same way; “they won’t have it for a\nminute.”\n\nStrether on his side also reflectively smoked. It was as if their high\nplace really represented some moral elevation from which they could\nlook down on their recent past. “There never was the smallest chance,\ndo you know, that they _would_ have it for a moment.”\n\n“Of course not—no real chance. But if they were willing to think there\nwas—!”\n\n“They weren’t willing.” Strether had worked it all out. “It wasn’t for\nyou they came out, but for me. It wasn’t to see for themselves what\nyou’re doing, but what I’m doing. The first branch of their curiosity\nwas inevitably destined, under my culpable delay, to give way to the\nsecond; and it’s on the second that, if I may use the expression and\nyou don’t mind my marking the invidious fact, they’ve been of late\nexclusively perched. When Sarah sailed it was me, in other words, they\nwere after.”\n\nChad took it in both with intelligence and with indulgence. “It _is_\nrather a business then—what I’ve let you in for!”\n\nStrether had again a brief pause; which ended in a reply that seemed to\ndispose once for all of this element of compunction. Chad was to treat\nit, at any rate, so far as they were again together, as having done so.\n“I was ‘in’ when you found me.”\n\n“Ah but it was you,” the young man laughed, “who found _me_.”\n\n“I only found you out. It was you who found me in. It was all in the\nday’s work for them, at all events, that they should come. And they’ve\ngreatly enjoyed it,” Strether declared.\n\n“Well, I’ve tried to make them,” said Chad.\n\nHis companion did himself presently the same justice. “So have I. I\ntried even this very morning—while Mrs. Pocock was with me. She enjoys\nfor instance, almost as much as anything else, not being, as I’ve said,\nafraid of me; and I think I gave her help in that.”\n\nChad took a deeper interest. “Was she very very nasty?”\n\nStrether debated. “Well, she was the most important thing—she was\ndefinite. She was—at last—crystalline. And I felt no remorse. I saw\nthat they must have come.”\n\n“Oh I wanted to see them for myself; so that if it were only for\n_that_—!” Chad’s own remorse was as small.\n\nThis appeared almost all Strether wanted. “Isn’t your having seen them\nfor yourself then _the_ thing, beyond all others, that has come of\ntheir visit?”\n\nChad looked as if he thought it nice of his old friend to put it so.\n“Don’t you count it as anything that you’re dished—if you _are_ dished?\nAre you, my dear man, dished?”\n\nIt sounded as if he were asking if he had caught cold or hurt his foot,\nand Strether for a minute but smoked and smoked. “I want to see her\nagain. I must see her.”\n\n“Of course you must.” Then Chad hesitated. “Do you mean—a—Mother\nherself?”\n\n“Oh your mother—that will depend.”\n\nIt was as if Mrs. Newsome had somehow been placed by the words very far\noff. Chad however endeavoured in spite of this to reach the place.\n“What do you mean it will depend on?”\n\nStrether, for all answer, gave him a longish look. “I was speaking of\nSarah. I must positively—though she quite cast me off—see _her_ again.\nI can’t part with her that way.”\n\n“Then she was awfully unpleasant?”\n\nAgain Strether exhaled. “She was what she had to be. I mean that from\nthe moment they’re not delighted they can only be—well what I admit she\nwas. We gave them,” he went on, “their chance to be delighted, and\nthey’ve walked up to it, and looked all round it, and not taken it.”\n\n“You can bring a horse to water—!” Chad suggested.\n\n“Precisely. And the tune to which this morning Sarah wasn’t\ndelighted—the tune to which, to adopt your metaphor, she refused to\ndrink—leaves us on that side nothing more to hope.”\n\nChad had a pause, and then as if consolingly: “It was never of course\nreally the least on the cards that they would be ‘delighted.’”\n\n“Well, I don’t know, after all,” Strether mused. “I’ve had to come as\nfar round. However”—he shook it off—“it’s doubtless _my_ performance\nthat’s absurd.”\n\n“There are certainly moments,” said Chad, “when you seem to me too good\nto be true. Yet if you are true,” he added, “that seems to be all that\nneed concern me.”\n\n“I’m true, but I’m incredible. I’m fantastic and ridiculous—I don’t\nexplain myself even _to_ myself. How can they then,” Strether asked,\n“understand me? So I don’t quarrel with them.”\n\n“I see. They quarrel,” said Chad rather comfortably, “with _us_.”\nStrether noted once more the comfort, but his young friend had already\ngone on. “I should feel greatly ashamed, all the same, if I didn’t put\nit before you again that you ought to think, after all, tremendously\nwell. I mean before giving up beyond recall—” With which insistence, as\nfrom a certain delicacy, dropped.\n\nAh but Strether wanted it. “Say it all, say it all.”\n\n“Well, at your age, and with what—when all’s said and done—Mother might\ndo for you and be for you.”\n\nChad had said it all, from his natural scruple, only to that extent; so\nthat Strether after an instant himself took a hand. “My absence of an\nassured future. The little I have to show toward the power to take care\nof myself. The way, the wonderful way, she would certainly take care of\nme. Her fortune, her kindness, and the constant miracle of her having\nbeen disposed to go even so far. Of course, of course”—he summed it up.\n“There are those sharp facts.”\n\nChad had meanwhile thought of another still. “And don’t you really\ncare—?”\n\nHis friend slowly turned round to him. “Will you go?”\n\n“I’ll go if you’ll say you now consider I should. You know,” he went\non, “I was ready six weeks ago.”\n\n“Ah,” said Strether, “that was when you didn’t know _I_ wasn’t! You’re\nready at present because you do know it.”\n\n“That may be,” Chad returned; “but all the same I’m sincere. You talk\nabout taking the whole thing on your shoulders, but in what light do\nyou regard me that you think me capable of letting you pay?” Strether\npatted his arm, as they stood together against the parapet,\nreassuringly—seeming to wish to contend that he _had_ the wherewithal;\nbut it was again round this question of purchase and price that the\nyoung man’s sense of fairness continued to hover. “What it literally\ncomes to for you, if you’ll pardon my putting it so, is that you give\nup money. Possibly a good deal of money.”\n\n“Oh,” Strether laughed, “if it were only just enough you’d still be\njustified in putting it so! But I’ve on my side to remind you too that\n_you_ give up money; and more than ‘possibly’—quite certainly, as I\nshould suppose—a good deal.”\n\n“True enough; but I’ve got a certain quantity,” Chad returned after a\nmoment. “Whereas you, my dear man, you—”\n\n“I can’t be at all said”—Strether took him up—“to have a ‘quantity’\ncertain or uncertain? Very true. Still, I shan’t starve.”\n\n“Oh you mustn’t _starve!_” Chad pacifically emphasised; and so, in the\npleasant conditions, they continued to talk; though there was, for that\nmatter, a pause in which the younger companion might have been taken as\nweighing again the delicacy of his then and there promising the elder\nsome provision against the possibility just mentioned. This, however,\nhe presumably thought best not to do, for at the end of another minute\nthey had moved in quite a different direction. Strether had broken in\nby returning to the subject of Chad’s passage with Sarah and enquiring\nif they had arrived, in the event, at anything in the nature of a\n“scene.” To this Chad replied that they had on the contrary kept\ntremendously polite; adding moreover that Sally was after all not the\nwoman to have made the mistake of not being. “Her hands are a good deal\ntied, you see. I got so, from the first,” he sagaciously observed, “the\nstart of her.”\n\n“You mean she has taken so much from you?”\n\n“Well, I couldn’t of course in common decency give less: only she\nhadn’t expected, I think, that I’d give her nearly so much. And she\nbegan to take it before she knew it.”\n\n“And she began to like it,” said Strether, “as soon as she began to\ntake it!”\n\n“Yes, she has liked it—also more than she expected.” After which Chad\nobserved: “But she doesn’t like _me_. In fact she hates me.”\n\nStrether’s interest grew. “Then why does she want you at home?”\n\n“Because when you hate you want to triumph, and if she should get me\nneatly stuck there she _would_ triumph.”\n\nStrether followed afresh, but looking as he went. “Certainly—in a\nmanner. But it would scarce be a triumph worth having if, once\nentangled, feeling her dislike and possibly conscious in time of a\ncertain quantity of your own, you should on the spot make yourself\nunpleasant to her.”\n\n“Ah,” said Chad, “she can bear _me_—could bear me at least at home.\nIt’s my being there that would be her triumph. She hates me in Paris.”\n\n“She hates in other words—”\n\n“Yes, _that’s_ it!”—Chad had quickly understood this understanding;\nwhich formed on the part of each as near an approach as they had yet\nmade to naming Madame de Vionnet. The limitations of their distinctness\ndidn’t, however, prevent its fairly lingering in the air that it was\nthis lady Mrs. Pocock hated. It added one more touch moreover to their\nestablished recognition of the rare intimacy of Chad’s association with\nher. He had never yet more twitched away the last light veil from this\nphenomenon than in presenting himself as confounded and submerged in\nthe feeling she had created at Woollett. “And I’ll tell you who hates\nme too,” he immediately went on.\n\nStrether knew as immediately whom he meant, but with as prompt a\nprotest. “Ah no! Mamie doesn’t hate—well,” he caught himself in\ntime—“anybody at all. Mamie’s beautiful.”\n\nChad shook his head. “That’s just why I mind it. She certainly doesn’t\nlike me.”\n\n“How much do you mind it? What would you do for her?”\n\n“Well, I’d like her if she’d like me. Really, really,” Chad declared.\n\nIt gave his companion a moment’s pause. “You asked me just now if I\ndon’t, as you said, ‘care’ about a certain person. You rather tempt me\ntherefore to put the question in my turn. Don’t _you_ care about a\ncertain other person?”\n\nChad looked at him hard in the lamplight of the window. “The difference\nis that I don’t want to.”\n\nStrether wondered. “‘Don’t want’ to?”\n\n“I try not to—that is I _have_ tried. I’ve done my best. You can’t be\nsurprised,” the young man easily went on, “when you yourself set me on\nit. I was indeed,” he added, “already on it a little; but you set me\nharder. It was six weeks ago that I thought I had come out.”\n\nStrether took it well in. “But you haven’t come out!”\n\n“I don’t know—it’s what I _want_ to know,” said Chad. “And if I could\nhave sufficiently wanted—by myself—to go back, I think I might have\nfound out.”\n\n“Possibly”—Strether considered. “But all you were able to achieve was\nto want to want to! And even then,” he pursued, “only till our friends\nthere came. Do you want to want to still?” As with a sound\nhalf-dolorous, half-droll and all vague and equivocal, Chad buried his\nface for a little in his hands, rubbing it in a whimsical way that\namounted to an evasion, he brought it out more sharply: “_Do_ you?”\n\nChad kept for a time his attitude, but at last he looked up, and then\nabruptly, “Jim _is_ a damned dose!” he declared.\n\n“Oh I don’t ask you to abuse or describe or in any way pronounce on\nyour relatives; I simply put it to you once more whether you’re _now_\nready. You say you’ve ‘seen.’ Is what you’ve seen that you can’t\nresist?”\n\nChad gave him a strange smile—the nearest approach he had ever shown to\na troubled one. “Can’t you make me _not_ resist?”\n\n“What it comes to,” Strether went on very gravely now and as if he\nhadn’t heard him, “what it comes to is that more has been done for you,\nI think, than I’ve ever seen done—attempted perhaps, but never so\nsuccessfully done—by one human being for another.”\n\n“Oh an immense deal certainly”—Chad did it full justice. “And you\nyourself are adding to it.”\n\nIt was without heeding this either that his visitor continued. “And our\nfriends there won’t have it.”\n\n“No, they simply won’t.”\n\n“They demand you on the basis, as it were, of repudiation and\ningratitude; and what has been the matter with me,” Strether went on,\n“is that I haven’t seen my way to working with you for repudiation.”\n\nChad appreciated this. “Then as you haven’t seen yours you naturally\nhaven’t seen mine. There it is.” After which he proceeded, with a\ncertain abruptness, to a sharp interrogation. “_Now_ do you say she\ndoesn’t hate me?”\n\nStrether hesitated. “‘She’—?”\n\n“Yes—Mother. We called it Sarah, but it comes to the same thing.”\n\n“Ah,” Strether objected, “not to the same thing as her hating _you_.”\n\nOn which—though as if for an instant it had hung fire—Chad remarkably\nreplied: “Well, if they hate my good friend, _that_ comes to the same\nthing.” It had a note of inevitable truth that made Strether take it as\nenough, feel he wanted nothing more. The young man spoke in it for his\n“good friend” more than he had ever yet directly spoken, confessed to\nsuch deep identities between them as he might play with the idea of\nworking free from, but which at a given moment could still draw him\ndown like a whirlpool. And meanwhile he had gone on. “Their hating you\ntoo moreover—that also comes to a good deal.”\n\n“Ah,” said Strether, “your mother doesn’t.”\n\nChad, however, loyally stuck to it—loyally, that is, to Strether. “She\nwill if you don’t look out.”\n\n“Well, I do look out. I am, after all, looking out. That’s just why,”\nour friend explained, “I want to see her again.”\n\nIt drew from Chad again the same question. “To see Mother?”\n\n“To see—for the present—Sarah.”\n\n“Ah then there you are! And what I don’t for the life of me make out,”\nChad pursued with resigned perplexity, “is what you _gain_ by it.”\n\nOh it would have taken his companion too long to say! “That’s because\nyou have, I verily believe, no imagination. You’ve other qualities. But\nno imagination, don’t you see? at all.”\n\n“I dare say. I do see.” It was an idea in which Chad showed interest.\n“But haven’t you yourself rather too much?”\n\n“Oh _rather_—!” So that after an instant, under this reproach and as if\nit were at last a fact really to escape from, Strether made his move\nfor departure.\n\n\n II\n\nOne of the features of the restless afternoon passed by him after Mrs.\nPocock’s visit was an hour spent, shortly before dinner, with Maria\nGostrey, whom of late, in spite of so sustained a call on his attention\nfrom other quarters, he had by no means neglected. And that he was\nstill not neglecting her will appear from the fact that he was with her\nagain at the same hour on the very morrow—with no less fine a\nconsciousness moreover of being able to hold her ear. It continued\ninveterately to occur, for that matter, that whenever he had taken one\nof his greater turns he came back to where she so faithfully awaited\nhim. None of these excursions had on the whole been livelier than the\npair of incidents—the fruit of the short interval since his previous\nvisit—on which he had now to report to her. He had seen Chad Newsome\nlate the night before, and he had had that morning, as a sequel to this\nconversation, a second interview with Sarah. “But they’re all off,” he\nsaid, “at last.”\n\nIt puzzled her a moment. “All?—Mr. Newsome with them?”\n\n“Ah not yet! Sarah and Jim and Mamie. But Waymarsh with them—for Sarah.\nIt’s too beautiful,” Strether continued; “I find I don’t get over\nthat—it’s always a fresh joy. But it’s a fresh joy too,” he added,\n“that—well, what do you think? Little Bilham also goes. But he of\ncourse goes for Mamie.”\n\nMiss Gostrey wondered. “‘For’ her? Do you mean they’re already\nengaged?”\n\n“Well,” said Strether, “say then for _me_. He’ll do anything for me;\njust as I will, for that matter—anything I can—for him. Or for Mamie\neither. _She’ll_ do anything for me.”\n\nMiss Gostrey gave a comprehensive sigh. “The way you reduce people to\nsubjection!”\n\n“It’s certainly, on one side, wonderful. But it’s quite equalled, on\nanother, by the way I don’t. I haven’t reduced Sarah, since yesterday;\nthough I’ve succeeded in seeing her again, as I’ll presently tell you.\nThe others however are really all right. Mamie, by that blessed law of\nours, absolutely must have a young man.”\n\n“But what must poor Mr. Bilham have? Do you mean they’ll _marry_ for\nyou?”\n\n“I mean that, by the same blessed law, it won’t matter a grain if they\ndon’t—I shan’t have in the least to worry.”\n\nShe saw as usual what he meant. “And Mr. Jim?—who goes for him?”\n\n“Oh,” Strether had to admit, “I couldn’t manage _that_. He’s thrown, as\nusual, on the world; the world which, after all, by his account—for he\nhas prodigious adventures—seems very good to him. He fortunately—‘over\nhere,’ as he says—finds the world everywhere; and his most prodigious\nadventure of all,” he went on, “has been of course of the last few\ndays.”\n\nMiss Gostrey, already knowing, instantly made the connexion. “He has\nseen Marie de Vionnet again?”\n\n“He went, all by himself, the day after Chad’s party—didn’t I tell\nyou?—to tea with her. By her invitation—all alone.”\n\n“Quite like yourself!” Maria smiled.\n\n“Oh but he’s more wonderful about her than I am!” And then as his\nfriend showed how she could believe it, filling it out, fitting it on\nto old memories of the wonderful woman: “What I should have liked to\nmanage would have been _her_ going.”\n\n“To Switzerland with the party?”\n\n“For Jim—and for symmetry. If it had been workable moreover for a\nfortnight she’d have gone. She’s ready”—he followed up his renewed\nvision of her—“for anything.”\n\nMiss Gostrey went with him a minute. “She’s too perfect!”\n\n“She _will_, I think,” he pursued, “go to-night to the station.”\n\n“To see him off?”\n\n“With Chad—marvellously—as part of their general attention. And she\ndoes it”—it kept before him—“with a light, light grace, a free, free\ngaiety, that may well softly bewilder Mr. Pocock.”\n\nIt kept her so before him that his companion had after an instant a\nfriendly comment. “As in short it has softly bewildered a saner man.\nAre you really in love with her?” Maria threw off.\n\n“It’s of no importance I should know,” he replied. “It matters so\nlittle—has nothing to do, practically, with either of us.”\n\n“All the same”—Maria continued to smile—“they go, the five, as I\nunderstand you, and you and Madame de Vionnet stay.”\n\n“Oh and Chad.” To which Strether added: “And you.”\n\n“Ah ‘me’!”—she gave a small impatient wail again, in which something of\nthe unreconciled seemed suddenly to break out. “_I_ don’t stay, it\nsomehow seems to me, much to my advantage. In the presence of all you\ncause to pass before me I’ve a tremendous sense of privation.”\n\nStrether hesitated. “But your privation, your keeping out of\neverything, has been—hasn’t it?—by your own choice.”\n\n“Oh yes; it has been necessary—that is it has been better for you. What\nI mean is only that I seem to have ceased to serve you.”\n\n“How can you tell that?” he asked. “You don’t know how you serve me.\nWhen you cease—”\n\n“Well?” she said as he dropped.\n\n“Well, I’ll _let_ you know. Be quiet till then.”\n\nShe thought a moment. “Then you positively like me to stay?”\n\n“Don’t I treat you as if I did?”\n\n“You’re certainly very kind to me. But that,” said Maria, “is for\nmyself. It’s getting late, as you see, and Paris turning rather hot and\ndusty. People are scattering, and some of them, in other places want\nme. But if you want me here—!”\n\nShe had spoken as resigned to his word, but he had of a sudden a still\nsharper sense than he would have expected of desiring not to lose her.\n“I want you here.”\n\nShe took it as if the words were all she had wished; as if they brought\nher, gave her something that was the compensation of her case. “Thank\nyou,” she simply answered. And then as he looked at her a little\nharder, “Thank you very much,” she repeated.\n\nIt had broken as with a slight arrest into the current of their talk,\nand it held him a moment longer. “Why, two months, or whatever the time\nwas, ago, did you so suddenly dash off? The reason you afterwards gave\nme for having kept away three weeks wasn’t the real one.”\n\nShe recalled. “I never supposed you believed it was. Yet,” she\ncontinued, “if you didn’t guess it that was just what helped you.”\n\nHe looked away from her on this; he indulged, so far as space\npermitted, in one of his slow absences. “I’ve often thought of it, but\nnever to feel that I could guess it. And you see the consideration with\nwhich I’ve treated you in never asking till now.”\n\n“Now then why _do_ you ask?”\n\n“To show you how I miss you when you’re not here, and what it does for\nme.”\n\n“It doesn’t seem to have done,” she laughed, “all it might! However,”\nshe added, “if you’ve really never guessed the truth I’ll tell it you.”\n\n“I’ve never guessed it,” Strether declared.\n\n“Never?”\n\n“Never.”\n\n“Well then I dashed off, as you say, so as not to have the confusion of\nbeing there if Marie de Vionnet should tell you anything to my\ndetriment.”\n\nHe looked as if he considerably doubted. “You even then would have had\nto face it on your return.”\n\n“Oh if I had found reason to believe it something very bad I’d have\nleft you altogether.”\n\n“So then,” he continued, “it was only on guessing she had been on the\nwhole merciful that you ventured back?”\n\nMaria kept it together. “I owe her thanks. Whatever her temptation she\ndidn’t separate us. That’s one of my reasons,” she went on “for\nadmiring her so.”\n\n“Let it pass then,” said Strether, “for one of mine as well. But what\nwould have been her temptation?”\n\n“What are ever the temptations of women?”\n\nHe thought—but hadn’t, naturally, to think too long. “Men?”\n\n“She would have had you, with it, more for herself. But she saw she\ncould have you without it.”\n\n“Oh ‘have’ me!” Strether a trifle ambiguously sighed. “_You_,” he\nhandsomely declared, “would have had me at any rate _with_ it.”\n\n“Oh ‘have’ you!”—she echoed it as he had done. “I do have you,\nhowever,” she less ironically said, “from the moment you express a\nwish.”\n\nHe stopped before her, full of the disposition. “I’ll express fifty.”\n\nWhich indeed begot in her, with a certain inconsequence, a return of\nher small wail. “Ah there you are!”\n\nThere, if it were so, he continued for the rest of the time to be, and\nit was as if to show her how she could still serve him that, coming\nback to the departure of the Pococks, he gave her the view, vivid with\na hundred more touches than we can reproduce, of what had happened for\nhim that morning. He had had ten minutes with Sarah at her hotel, ten\nminutes reconquered, by irresistible pressure, from the time over which\nhe had already described her to Miss Gostrey as having, at the end of\ntheir interview on his own premises, passed the great sponge of the\nfuture. He had caught her by not announcing himself, had found her in\nher sitting-room with a dressmaker and a _lingère_ whose accounts she\nappeared to have been more or less ingenuously settling and who soon\nwithdrew. Then he had explained to her how he had succeeded, late the\nnight before, in keeping his promise of seeing Chad. “I told her I’d\ntake it all.”\n\n“You’d ‘take’ it?”\n\n“Why if he doesn’t go.”\n\nMaria waited. “And who takes it if he does?” she enquired with a\ncertain grimness of gaiety.\n\n“Well,” said Strether, “I think I take, in any event, everything.”\n\n“By which I suppose you mean,” his companion brought out after a\nmoment, “that you definitely understand you now lose everything.”\n\nHe stood before her again. “It does come perhaps to the same thing. But\nChad, now that he has seen, doesn’t really want it.”\n\nShe could believe that, but she made, as always, for clearness. “Still,\nwhat, after all, _has_ he seen?”\n\n“What they want of him. And it’s enough.”\n\n“It contrasts so unfavourably with what Madame de Vionnet wants?”\n\n“It contrasts—just so; all round, and tremendously.”\n\n“Therefore, perhaps, most of all with what _you_ want?”\n\n“Oh,” said Strether, “what I want is a thing I’ve ceased to measure or\neven to understand.”\n\nBut his friend none the less went on. “Do you want Mrs. Newsome—after\nsuch a way of treating you?”\n\nIt was a straighter mode of dealing with this lady than they had as\nyet—such was their high form—permitted themselves; but it seemed not\nwholly for this that he delayed a moment. “I dare say it has been,\nafter all, the only way she could have imagined.”\n\n“And does that make you want her any more?”\n\n“I’ve tremendously disappointed her,” Strether thought it worth while\nto mention.\n\n“Of course you have. That’s rudimentary; that was plain to us long ago.\nBut isn’t it almost as plain,” Maria went on, “that you’ve even yet\nyour straight remedy? Really drag him away, as I believe you still can,\nand you’d cease to have to count with her disappointment.”\n\n“Ah then,” he laughed, “I should have to count with yours!”\n\nBut this barely struck her now. “What, in that case, should you call\ncounting? You haven’t come out where you are, I think, to please _me_.”\n\n“Oh,” he insisted, “that too, you know, has been part of it. I can’t\nseparate—it’s all one; and that’s perhaps why, as I say, I don’t\nunderstand.” But he was ready to declare again that this didn’t in the\nleast matter; all the more that, as he affirmed, he _hadn’t_ really as\nyet “come out.” “She gives me after all, on its coming to the pinch, a\nlast mercy, another chance. They don’t sail, you see, for five or six\nweeks more, and they haven’t—she admits that—expected Chad would take\npart in their tour. It’s still open to him to join them, at the last,\nat Liverpool.”\n\nMiss Gostrey considered. “How in the world is it ‘open’ unless you open\nit? How can he join them at Liverpool if he but sinks deeper into his\nsituation here?”\n\n“He has given her—as I explained to you that she let me know\nyesterday—his word of honour to do as I say.”\n\nMaria stared. “But if you say nothing!”\n\nWell, he as usual walked about on it. “I did say something this\nmorning. I gave her my answer—the word I had promised her after hearing\nfrom himself what _he_ had promised. What she demanded of me yesterday,\nyou’ll remember, was the engagement then and there to make him take up\nthis vow.”\n\n“Well then,” Miss Gostrey enquired, “was the purpose of your visit to\nher only to decline?”\n\n“No; it was to ask, odd as that may seem to you, for another delay.”\n\n“Ah that’s weak!”\n\n“Precisely!” She had spoken with impatience, but, so far as that at\nleast, he knew where he was. “If I _am_ weak I want to find it out. If\nI don’t find it out I shall have the comfort, the little glory, of\nthinking I’m strong.”\n\n“It’s all the comfort, I judge,” she returned, “that you _will_ have!”\n\n“At any rate,” he said, “it will have been a month more. Paris may\ngrow, from day to day, hot and dusty, as you say; but there are other\nthings that are hotter and dustier. I’m not afraid to stay on; the\nsummer here must be amusing in a wild—if it isn’t a tame—way of its\nown; the place at no time more picturesque. I think I shall like it.\nAnd then,” he benevolently smiled for her, “there will be always you.”\n\n“Oh,” she objected, “it won’t be as a part of the picturesqueness that\nI shall stay, for I shall be the plainest thing about you. You may, you\nsee, at any rate,” she pursued, “have nobody else. Madame de Vionnet\nmay very well be going off, mayn’t she?—and Mr. Newsome by the same\nstroke: unless indeed you’ve had an assurance from them to the\ncontrary. So that if your idea’s to stay for them”—it was her duty to\nsuggest it—“you may be left in the lurch. Of course if they do\nstay”—she kept it up—“they would be part of the picturesqueness. Or\nelse indeed you might join them somewhere.”\n\nStrether seemed to face it as if it were a happy thought; but the next\nmoment he spoke more critically. “Do you mean that they’ll probably go\noff together?”\n\nShe just considered. “I think it will be treating you quite without\nceremony if they do; though after all,” she added, “it would be\ndifficult to see now quite what degree of ceremony properly meets your\ncase.”\n\n“Of course,” Strether conceded, “my attitude toward them is\nextraordinary.”\n\n“Just so; so that one may ask one’s self what style of proceeding on\ntheir own part can altogether match it. The attitude of their own that\nwon’t pale in its light they’ve doubtless still to work out. The really\nhandsome thing perhaps,” she presently threw off, “_would_ be for them\nto withdraw into more secluded conditions, offering at the same time to\nshare them with you.” He looked at her, on this, as if some generous\nirritation—all in his interest—had suddenly again flickered in her; and\nwhat she next said indeed half-explained it. “Don’t really be afraid to\ntell me if what now holds you _is_ the pleasant prospect of the empty\ntown, with plenty of seats in the shade, cool drinks, deserted museums,\ndrives to the Bois in the evening, and our wonderful woman all to\nyourself.” And she kept it up still more. “The handsomest thing of\n_all_, when one makes it out, would, I dare say, be that Mr. Chad\nshould for a while go off by himself. It’s a pity, from that point of\nview,” she wound up, “that he doesn’t pay his mother a visit. It would\nat least occupy your interval.” The thought in fact held her a moment.\n“Why doesn’t he pay his mother a visit? Even a week, at this good\nmoment, would do.”\n\n“My dear lady,” Strether replied—and he had it even to himself\nsurprisingly ready—“my dear lady, his mother has paid _him_ a visit.\nMrs. Newsome has been with him, this month, with an intensity that I’m\nsure he has thoroughly felt; he has lavishly entertained her, and she\nhas let him have her thanks. Do you suggest he shall go back for more\nof them?”\n\nWell, she succeeded after a little in shaking it off. “I see. It’s what\nyou don’t suggest—what you haven’t suggested. And you know.”\n\n“So would you, my dear,” he kindly said, “if you had so much as seen\nher.”\n\n“As seen Mrs. Newsome?”\n\n“No, Sarah—which, both for Chad and for myself, has served all the\npurpose.”\n\n“And served it in a manner,” she responsively mused, “so\nextraordinary!”\n\n“Well, you see,” he partly explained, “what it comes to is that she’s\nall cold thought—which Sarah could serve to us cold without its really\nlosing anything. So it is that we know what she thinks of us.”\n\nMaria had followed, but she had an arrest. “What I’ve never made out,\nif you come to that, is what you think—I mean you personally—of _her_.\nDon’t you so much, when all’s said, as care a little?”\n\n“That,” he answered with no loss of promptness, “is what even Chad\nhimself asked me last night. He asked me if I don’t mind the loss—well,\nthe loss of an opulent future. Which moreover,” he hastened to add,\n“was a perfectly natural question.”\n\n“I call your attention, all the same,” said Miss Gostrey, “to the fact\nthat I don’t ask it. What I venture to ask is whether it’s to Mrs.\nNewsome herself that you’re indifferent.”\n\n“I haven’t been so”—he spoke with all assurance. “I’ve been the very\nopposite. I’ve been, from the first moment, preoccupied with the\nimpression everything might be making on her—quite oppressed, haunted,\ntormented by it. I’ve been interested _only_ in her seeing what I’ve\nseen. And I’ve been as disappointed in her refusal to see it as she has\nbeen in what has appeared to her the perversity of my insistence.”\n\n“Do you mean that she has shocked you as you’ve shocked her?”\n\nStrether weighed it. “I’m probably not so shockable. But on the other\nhand I’ve gone much further to meet her. She, on her side, hasn’t\nbudged an inch.”\n\n“So that you’re now at last”—Maria pointed the moral—“in the sad stage\nof recriminations.”\n\n“No—it’s only to you I speak. I’ve been like a lamb to Sarah. I’ve only\nput my back to the wall. It’s to _that_ one naturally staggers when one\nhas been violently pushed there.”\n\nShe watched him a moment. “Thrown over?”\n\n“Well, as I feel I’ve landed somewhere I think I must have been\nthrown.”\n\nShe turned it over, but as hoping to clarify much rather than to\nharmonise. “The thing is that I suppose you’ve been disappointing—”\n\n“Quite from the very first of my arrival? I dare say. I admit I was\nsurprising even to myself.”\n\n“And then of course,” Maria went on, “I had much to do with it.”\n\n“With my being surprising—?”\n\n“That will do,” she laughed, “if you’re too delicate to call it _my_\nbeing! Naturally,” she added, “you came over more or less for\nsurprises.”\n\n“Naturally!”—he valued the reminder.\n\n“But they were to have been all for you”—she continued to piece it\nout—“and none of them for _her_.”\n\nOnce more he stopped before her as if she had touched the point.\n“That’s just her difficulty—that she doesn’t admit surprises. It’s a\nfact that, I think, describes and represents her; and it falls in with\nwhat I tell you—that she’s all, as I’ve called it, fine cold thought.\nShe had, to her own mind, worked the whole thing out in advance, and\nworked it out for me as well as for herself. Whenever she has done\nthat, you see, there’s no room left; no margin, as it were, for any\nalteration. She’s filled as full, packed as tight, as she’ll hold and\nif you wish to get anything more or different either out or in—”\n\n“You’ve got to make over altogether the woman herself?”\n\n“What it comes to,” said Strether, “is that you’ve got morally and\nintellectually to get rid of her.”\n\n“Which would appear,” Maria returned, “to be practically what you’ve\ndone.”\n\nBut her friend threw back his head. “I haven’t touched her. She won’t\n_be_ touched. I see it now as I’ve never done; and she hangs together\nwith a perfection of her own,” he went on, “that does suggest a kind of\nwrong in _any_ change of her composition. It was at any rate,” he wound\nup, “the woman herself, as you call her the whole moral and\nintellectual being or block, that Sarah brought me over to take or to\nleave.”\n\nIt turned Miss Gostrey to deeper thought. “Fancy having to take at the\npoint of the bayonet a whole moral and intellectual being or block!”\n\n“It was in fact,” said Strether, “what, at home, I _had_ done. But\nsomehow over there I didn’t quite know it.”\n\n“One never does, I suppose,” Miss Gostrey concurred, “realise in\nadvance, in such a case, the size, as you may say, of the block. Little\nby little it looms up. It has been looming for you more and more till\nat last you see it all.”\n\n“I see it all,” he absently echoed, while his eyes might have been\nfixing some particularly large iceberg in a cool blue northern sea.\n“It’s magnificent!” he then rather oddly exclaimed.\n\nBut his friend, who was used to this kind of inconsequence in him, kept\nthe thread. “There’s nothing so magnificent—for making others feel\nyou—as to have no imagination.”\n\nIt brought him straight round. “Ah there you are! It’s what I said last\nnight to Chad. That he himself, I mean, has none.”\n\n“Then it would appear,” Maria suggested, “that he has, after all,\nsomething in common with his mother.”\n\n“He has in common that he makes one, as you say, ‘feel’ him. And yet,”\nhe added, as if the question were interesting, “one feels others too,\neven when they have plenty.”\n\nMiss Gostrey continued suggestive. “Madame de Vionnet?”\n\n“_She_ has plenty.”\n\n“Certainly—she had quantities of old. But there are different ways of\nmaking one’s self felt.”\n\n“Yes, it comes, no doubt, to that. You now—”\n\nHe was benevolently going on, but she wouldn’t have it. “Oh I _don’t_\nmake myself felt; so my quantity needn’t be settled. Yours, you know,”\nshe said, “is monstrous. No one has ever had so much.”\n\nIt struck him for a moment. “That’s what Chad also thinks.”\n\n“There _you_ are then—though it isn’t for him to complain of it!”\n\n“Oh he doesn’t complain of it,” said Strether.\n\n“That’s all that would be wanting! But apropos of what,” Maria went on,\n“did the question come up?”\n\n“Well, of his asking me what it is I gain.”\n\nShe had a pause. “Then as I’ve asked you too it settles _my_ case. Oh\nyou _have_,” she repeated, “treasures of imagination.”\n\nBut he had been for an instant thinking away from this, and he came up\nin another place. “And yet Mrs. Newsome—it’s a thing to remember—_has_\nimagined, did, that is, imagine, and apparently still does, horrors\nabout what I should have found. I was booked, by her\nvision—extraordinarily intense, after all—to find them; and that I\ndidn’t, that I couldn’t, that, as she evidently felt, I wouldn’t—this\nevidently didn’t at all, as they say, ‘suit’ her book. It was more than\nshe could bear. That was her disappointment.”\n\n“You mean you were to have found Chad himself horrible?”\n\n“I was to have found the woman.”\n\n“Horrible?”\n\n“Found her as she imagined her.” And Strether paused as if for his own\nexpression of it he could add no touch to that picture.\n\nHis companion had meanwhile thought. “She imagined stupidly—so it comes\nto the same thing.”\n\n“Stupidly? Oh!” said Strether.\n\nBut she insisted. “She imagined meanly.”\n\nHe had it, however, better. “It couldn’t but be ignorantly.”\n\n“Well, intensity with ignorance—what do you want worse?”\n\nThis question might have held him, but he let it pass. “Sarah isn’t\nignorant—now; she keeps up the theory of the horrible.”\n\n“Ah but she’s intense—and that by itself will do sometimes as well. If\nit doesn’t do, in this case, at any rate, to deny that Marie’s\ncharming, it will do at least to deny that she’s good.”\n\n“What I claim is that she’s good for Chad.”\n\n“You don’t claim”—she seemed to like it clear—“that she’s good for\n_you_.”\n\nBut he continued without heeding. “That’s what I wanted them to come\nout for—to see for themselves if she’s bad for him.”\n\n“And now that they’ve done so they won’t admit that she’s good even for\nanything?”\n\n“They do think,” Strether presently admitted, “that she’s on the whole\nabout as bad for me. But they’re consistent of course, inasmuch as\nthey’ve their clear view of what’s good for both of us.”\n\n“For you, to begin with”—Maria, all responsive, confined the question\nfor the moment—“to eliminate from your existence and if possible even\nfrom your memory the dreadful creature that _I_ must gruesomely shadow\nforth for them, even more than to eliminate the distincter evil—thereby\na little less portentous—of the person whose confederate you’ve\nsuffered yourself to become. However, that’s comparatively simple. You\ncan easily, at the worst, after all, give me up.”\n\n“I can easily at the worst, after all, give you up.” The irony was so\nobvious that it needed no care. “I can easily at the worst, after all,\neven forget you.”\n\n“Call that then workable. But Mr. Newsome has much more to forget. How\ncan _he_ do it?”\n\n“Ah there again we are! That’s just what I was to have made him do;\njust where I was to have worked with him and helped.”\n\nShe took it in silence and without attenuation—as if perhaps from very\nfamiliarity with the facts; and her thought made a connexion without\nshowing the links. “Do you remember how we used to talk at Chester and\nin London about my seeing you through?” She spoke as of far-off things\nand as if they had spent weeks at the places she named.\n\n“It’s just what you _are_ doing.”\n\n“Ah but the worst—since you’ve left such a margin—may be still to come.\nYou may yet break down.”\n\n“Yes, I may yet break down. But will you take me—?”\n\nHe had hesitated, and she waited. “Take you?”\n\n“For as long as I can bear it.”\n\nShe also debated “Mr. Newsome and Madame de Vionnet may, as we were\nsaying, leave town. How long do you think you can bear it without\nthem?”\n\nStrether’s reply to this was at first another question. “Do you mean in\norder to get away from me?”\n\nHer answer had an abruptness. “Don’t find me rude if I say I should\nthink they’d want to!”\n\nHe looked at her hard again—seemed even for an instant to have an\nintensity of thought under which his colour changed. But he smiled.\n“You mean after what they’ve done to me?”\n\n“After what _she_ has.”\n\nAt this, however, with a laugh, he was all right again. “Ah but she\nhasn’t done it yet!”\n\n\n III\n\nHe had taken the train a few days after this from a station—as well as\n_to_ a station—selected almost at random; such days, whatever should\nhappen, were numbered, and he had gone forth under the impulse—artless\nenough, no doubt—to give the whole of one of them to that French\nruralism, with its cool special green, into which he had hitherto\nlooked only through the little oblong window of the picture-frame. It\nhad been as yet for the most part but a land of fancy for him—the\nbackground of fiction, the medium of art, the nursery of letters;\npractically as distant as Greece, but practically also well-nigh as\nconsecrated. Romance could weave itself, for Strether’s sense, out of\nelements mild enough; and even after what he had, as he felt, lately\n“been through,” he could thrill a little at the chance of seeing\nsomething somewhere that would remind him of a certain small Lambinet\nthat had charmed him, long years before, at a Boston dealer’s and that\nhe had quite absurdly never forgotten. It had been offered, he\nremembered, at a price he had been instructed to believe the lowest\never named for a Lambinet, a price he had never felt so poor as on\nhaving to recognise, all the same, as beyond a dream of possibility. He\nhad dreamed—had turned and twisted possibilities for an hour: it had\nbeen the only adventure of his life in connexion with the purchase of a\nwork of art. The adventure, it will be perceived, was modest; but the\nmemory, beyond all reason and by some accident of association, was\nsweet. The little Lambinet abode with him as the picture he _would_\nhave bought—the particular production that had made him for the moment\noverstep the modesty of nature. He was quite aware that if he were to\nsee it again he should perhaps have a drop or a shock, and he never\nfound himself wishing that the wheel of time would turn it up again,\njust as he had seen it in the maroon-coloured, sky-lighted inner shrine\nof Tremont Street. It would be a different thing, however, to see the\nremembered mixture resolved back into its elements—to assist at the\nrestoration to nature of the whole far-away hour: the dusty day in\nBoston, the background of the Fitchburg Depot, of the maroon-coloured\nsanctum, the special-green vision, the ridiculous price, the poplars,\nthe willows, the rushes, the river, the sunny silvery sky, the shady\nwoody horizon.\n\nHe observed in respect to his train almost no condition save that it\nshould stop a few times after getting out of the _banlieue_; he threw\nhimself on the general amiability of the day for the hint of where to\nalight. His theory of his excursion was that he could alight\nanywhere—not nearer Paris than an hour’s run—on catching a suggestion\nof the particular note required. It made its sign, the\nsuggestion—weather, air, light, colour and his mood all favouring—at\nthe end of some eighty minutes; the train pulled up just at the right\nspot, and he found himself getting out as securely as if to keep an\nappointment. It will be felt of him that he could amuse himself, at his\nage, with very small things if it be again noted that his appointment\nwas only with a superseded Boston fashion. He hadn’t gone far without\nthe quick confidence that it would be quite sufficiently kept. The\noblong gilt frame disposed its enclosing lines; the poplars and\nwillows, the reeds and river—a river of which he didn’t know, and\ndidn’t want to know, the name—fell into a composition, full of\nfelicity, within them; the sky was silver and turquoise and varnish;\nthe village on the left was white and the church on the right was grey;\nit was all there, in short—it was what he wanted: it was Tremont\nStreet, it was France, it was Lambinet. Moreover he was freely walking\nabout in it. He did this last, for an hour, to his heart’s content,\nmaking for the shady woody horizon and boring so deep into his\nimpression and his idleness that he might fairly have got through them\nagain and reached the maroon-coloured wall. It was a wonder, no doubt,\nthat the taste of idleness for him shouldn’t need more time to sweeten;\nbut it had in fact taken the few previous days; it had been sweetening\nin truth ever since the retreat of the Pococks. He walked and walked as\nif to show himself how little he had now to do; he had nothing to do\nbut turn off to some hillside where he might stretch himself and hear\nthe poplars rustle, and whence—in the course of an afternoon so spent,\nan afternoon richly suffused too with the sense of a book in his\npocket—he should sufficiently command the scene to be able to pick out\njust the right little rustic inn for an experiment in respect to\ndinner. There was a train back to Paris at 9.20, and he saw himself\npartaking, at the close of the day, with the enhancements of a coarse\nwhite cloth and a sanded door, of something fried and felicitous,\nwashed down with authentic wine; after which he might, as he liked,\neither stroll back to his station in the gloaming or propose for the\nlocal _carriole_ and converse with his driver, a driver who naturally\nwouldn’t fail of a stiff clean blouse, of a knitted nightcap and of the\ngenius of response—who, in fine, would sit on the shafts, tell him what\nthe French people were thinking, and remind him, as indeed the whole\nepisode would incidentally do, of Maupassant. Strether heard his lips,\nfor the first time in French air, as this vision assumed consistency,\nemit sounds of expressive intention without fear of his company. He had\nbeen afraid of Chad and of Maria and of Madame de Vionnet; he had been\nmost of all afraid of Waymarsh, in whose presence, so far as they had\nmixed together in the light of the town, he had never without somehow\npaying for it aired either his vocabulary or his accent. He usually\npaid for it by meeting immediately afterwards Waymarsh’s eye.\n\nSuch were the liberties with which his fancy played after he had turned\noff to the hillside that did really and truly, as well as most amiably,\nawait him beneath the poplars, the hillside that made him feel, for a\nmurmurous couple of hours, how happy had been his thought. He had the\nsense of success, of a finer harmony in things; nothing but what had\nturned out as yet according to his plan. It most of all came home to\nhim, as he lay on his back on the grass, that Sarah had really gone,\nthat his tension was really relaxed; the peace diffused in these ideas\nmight be delusive, but it hung about him none the less for the time. It\nfairly, for half an hour, sent him to sleep; he pulled his straw hat\nover his eyes—he had bought it the day before with a reminiscence of\nWaymarsh’s—and lost himself anew in Lambinet. It was as if he had found\nout he was tired—tired not from his walk, but from that inward exercise\nwhich had known, on the whole, for three months, so little\nintermission. That was it—when once they were off he had dropped; this\nmoreover was what he had dropped to, and now he was touching bottom. He\nwas kept luxuriously quiet, soothed and amused by the consciousness of\nwhat he had found at the end of his descent. It was very much what he\nhad told Maria Gostrey he should like to stay on for, the\nhugely-distributed Paris of summer, alternately dazzling and dusky,\nwith a weight lifted for him off its columns and cornices and with\nshade and air in the flutter of awnings as wide as avenues. It was\npresent to him without attenuation that, reaching out, the day after\nmaking the remark, for some proof of his freedom, he had gone that very\nafternoon to see Madame de Vionnet. He had gone again the next day but\none, and the effect of the two visits, the after-sense of the couple of\nhours spent with her, was almost that of fulness and frequency. The\nbrave intention of frequency, so great with him from the moment of his\nfinding himself unjustly suspected at Woollett, had remained rather\ntheoretic, and one of the things he could muse about under his poplars\nwas the source of the special shyness that had still made him careful.\nHe had surely got rid of it now, this special shyness; what had become\nof it if it hadn’t precisely, within the week, rubbed off?\n\nIt struck him now in fact as sufficiently plain that if he had still\nbeen careful he had been so for a reason. He had really feared, in his\nbehaviour, a lapse from good faith; if there was a danger of one’s\nliking such a woman too much one’s best safety was in waiting at least\ntill one had the right to do so. In the light of the last few days the\ndanger was fairly vivid; so that it was proportionately fortunate that\nthe right was likewise established. It seemed to our friend that he had\non each occasion profited to the utmost by the latter: how could he\nhave done so more, he at all events asked himself, than in having\nimmediately let her know that, if it was all the same to her, he\npreferred not to talk about anything tiresome? He had never in his life\nso sacrificed an armful of high interests as in that remark; he had\nnever so prepared the way for the comparatively frivolous as in\naddressing it to Madame de Vionnet’s intelligence. It hadn’t been till\nlater that he quite recalled how in conjuring away everything but the\npleasant he had conjured away almost all they had hitherto talked\nabout; it was not till later even that he remembered how, with their\nnew tone, they hadn’t so much as mentioned the name of Chad himself.\nOne of the things that most lingered with him on his hillside was this\ndelightful facility, with such a woman, of arriving at a new tone; he\nthought, as he lay on his back, of all the tones she might make\npossible if one were to try her, and at any rate of the probability\nthat one could trust her to fit them to occasions. He had wanted her to\nfeel that, as he was disinterested now, so she herself should be, and\nshe had showed she felt it, and he had showed he was grateful, and it\nhad been for all the world as if he were calling for the first time.\nThey had had other, but irrelevant, meetings; it was quite as if, had\nthey sooner known how much they _really_ had in common, there were\nquantities of comparatively dull matters they might have skipped. Well,\nthey were skipping them now, even to graceful gratitude, even to\nhandsome “Don’t mention it!”—and it was amazing what could still come\nup without reference to what had been going on between them. It might\nhave been, on analysis, nothing more than Shakespeare and the musical\nglasses; but it had served all the purpose of his appearing to have\nsaid to her: “Don’t like me, if it’s a question of liking me, for\nanything obvious and clumsy that I’ve, as they call it, ‘done’ for you:\nlike me—well, like me, hang it, for anything else you choose. So, by\nthe same propriety, don’t be for me simply the person I’ve come to know\nthrough my awkward connexion with Chad—was ever anything, by the way,\n_more_ awkward? Be for me, please, with all your admirable tact and\ntrust, just whatever I may show you it’s a present pleasure to me to\nthink you.” It had been a large indication to meet; but if she hadn’t\nmet it what _had_ she done, and how had their time together slipped\nalong so smoothly, mild but not slow, and melting, liquefying, into his\nhappy illusion of idleness? He could recognise on the other hand that\nhe had probably not been without reason, in his prior, his restricted\nstate, for keeping an eye on his liability to lapse from good faith.\n\nHe really continued in the picture—that being for himself his\nsituation—all the rest of this rambling day; so that the charm was\nstill, was indeed more than ever upon him when, toward six o’clock he\nfound himself amicably engaged with a stout white-capped deep-voiced\nwoman at the door of the _auberge_ of the biggest village, a village\nthat affected him as a thing of whiteness, blueness and crookedness,\nset in coppery green, and that had the river flowing behind or before\nit—one couldn’t say which; at the bottom, in particular, of the\ninn-garden. He had had other adventures before this; had kept along the\nheight, after shaking off slumber; had admired, had almost coveted,\nanother small old church, all steep roof and dim slate-colour without\nand all whitewash and paper flowers within; had lost his way and had\nfound it again; had conversed with rustics who struck him perhaps a\nlittle more as men of the world than he had expected; had acquired at a\nbound a fearless facility in French; had had, as the afternoon waned, a\nwatery _bock_, all pale and Parisian, in the café of the furthest\nvillage, which was not the biggest; and had meanwhile not once\noverstepped the oblong gilt frame. The frame had drawn itself out for\nhim, as much as you please; but that was just his luck. He had finally\ncome down again to the valley, to keep within touch of stations and\ntrains, turning his face to the quarter from which he had started; and\nthus it was that he had at last pulled up before the hostess of the\nCheval Blanc, who met him, with a rough readiness that was like the\nclatter of sabots over stones, on their common ground of a _côtelette\nde veau à l’oseille_ and a subsequent lift. He had walked many miles\nand didn’t know he was tired; but he still knew he was amused, and even\nthat, though he had been alone all day, he had never yet so struck\nhimself as engaged with others and in midstream of his drama. It might\nhave passed for finished his drama, with its catastrophe all but\nreached: it had, however, none the less been vivid again for him as he\nthus gave it its fuller chance. He had only had to be at last well out\nof it to feel it, oddly enough, still going on.\n\nFor this had been all day at bottom the spell of the picture—that it\nwas essentially more than anything else a scene and a stage, that the\nvery air of the play was in the rustle of the willows and the tone of\nthe sky. The play and the characters had, without his knowing it till\nnow, peopled all his space for him, and it seemed somehow quite happy\nthat they should offer themselves, in the conditions so supplied, with\na kind of inevitability. It was as if the conditions made them not only\ninevitable, but so much more nearly natural and right as that they were\nat least easier, pleasanter, to put up with. The conditions had nowhere\nso asserted their difference from those of Woollett as they appeared to\nhim to assert it in the little court of the Cheval Blanc while he\narranged with his hostess for a comfortable climax. They were few and\nsimple, scant and humble, but they were _the thing_, as he would have\ncalled it, even to a greater degree than Madame de Vionnet’s old high\nsalon where the ghost of the Empire walked. “The” thing was the thing\nthat implied the greatest number of other things of the sort he had had\nto tackle; and it was queer of course, but so it was—the implication\nhere was complete. Not a single one of his observations but somehow\nfell into a place in it; not a breath of the cooler evening that wasn’t\nsomehow a syllable of the text. The text was simply, when condensed,\nthat in _these_ places such things were, and that if it was in them one\nelected to move about one had to make one’s account with what one\nlighted on. Meanwhile at all events it was enough that they did affect\none—so far as the village aspect was concerned—as whiteness,\ncrookedness and blueness set in coppery green; there being positively,\nfor that matter, an outer wall of the White Horse that was painted the\nmost improbable shade. That was part of the amusement—as if to show\nthat the fun was harmless; just as it was enough, further, that the\npicture and the play seemed supremely to melt together in the good\nwoman’s broad sketch of what she could do for her visitor’s appetite.\nHe felt in short a confidence, and it was general, and it was all he\nwanted to feel. It suffered no shock even on her mentioning that she\nhad in fact just laid the cloth for two persons who, unlike Monsieur,\nhad arrived by the river—in a boat of their own; who had asked her,\nhalf an hour before, what she could do for them, and had then paddled\naway to look at something a little further up—from which promenade they\nwould presently return. Monsieur might meanwhile, if he liked, pass\ninto the garden, such as it was, where she would serve him, should he\nwish it—for there were tables and benches in plenty—a “bitter” before\nhis repast. Here she would also report to him on the possibility of a\nconveyance to his station, and here at any rate he would have the\n_agrément_ of the river.\n\nIt may be mentioned without delay that Monsieur had the _agrément_ of\neverything, and in particular, for the next twenty minutes, of a small\nand primitive pavilion that, at the garden’s edge, almost overhung the\nwater, testifying, in its somewhat battered state, to much fond\nfrequentation. It consisted of little more than a platform, slightly\nraised, with a couple of benches and a table, a protecting rail and a\nprojecting roof; but it raked the full grey-blue stream, which, taking\na turn a short distance above, passed out of sight to reappear much\nhigher up; and it was clearly in esteemed requisition for Sundays and\nother feasts. Strether sat there and, though hungry, felt at peace; the\nconfidence that had so gathered for him deepened with the lap of the\nwater, the ripple of the surface, the rustle of the reeds on the\nopposite bank, the faint diffused coolness and the slight rock of a\ncouple of small boats attached to a rough landing-place hard by. The\nvalley on the further side was all copper-green level and glazed pearly\nsky, a sky hatched across with screens of trimmed trees, which looked\nflat, like espaliers; and though the rest of the village straggled away\nin the near quarter the view had an emptiness that made one of the\nboats suggestive. Such a river set one afloat almost before one could\ntake up the oars—the idle play of which would be moreover the aid to\nthe full impression. This perception went so far as to bring him to his\nfeet; but that movement, in turn, made him feel afresh that he was\ntired, and while he leaned against a post and continued to look out he\nsaw something that gave him a sharper arrest.\n\n\n IV\n\nWhat he saw was exactly the right thing—a boat advancing round the bend\nand containing a man who held the paddles and a lady, at the stern,\nwith a pink parasol. It was suddenly as if these figures, or something\nlike them, had been wanted in the picture, had been wanted more or less\nall day, and had now drifted into sight, with the slow current, on\npurpose to fill up the measure. They came slowly, floating down,\nevidently directed to the landing-place near their spectator and\npresenting themselves to him not less clearly as the two persons for\nwhom his hostess was already preparing a meal. For two very happy\npersons he found himself straightway taking them—a young man in\nshirt-sleeves, a young woman easy and fair, who had pulled pleasantly\nup from some other place and, being acquainted with the neighbourhood,\nhad known what this particular retreat could offer them. The air quite\nthickened, at their approach, with further intimations; the intimation\nthat they were expert, familiar, frequent—that this wouldn’t at all\nevents be the first time. They knew how to do it, he vaguely felt—and\nit made them but the more idyllic, though at the very moment of the\nimpression, as happened, their boat seemed to have begun to drift wide,\nthe oarsman letting it go. It had by this time none the less come much\nnearer—near enough for Strether to dream the lady in the stern had for\nsome reason taken account of his being there to watch them. She had\nremarked on it sharply, yet her companion hadn’t turned round; it was\nin fact almost as if our friend had felt her bid him keep still. She\nhad taken in something as a result of which their course had wavered,\nand it continued to waver while they just stood off. This little effect\nwas sudden and rapid, so rapid that Strether’s sense of it was separate\nonly for an instant from a sharp start of his own. He too had within\nthe minute taken in something, taken in that he knew the lady whose\nparasol, shifting as if to hide her face, made so fine a pink point in\nthe shining scene. It was too prodigious, a chance in a million, but,\nif he knew the lady, the gentleman, who still presented his back and\nkept off, the gentleman, the coatless hero of the idyll, who had\nresponded to her start, was, to match the marvel, none other than Chad.\n\nChad and Madame de Vionnet were then like himself taking a day in the\ncountry—though it was as queer as fiction, as farce, that their country\ncould happen to be exactly his; and she had been the first at\nrecognition, the first to feel, across the water, the shock—for it\nappeared to come to that—of their wonderful accident. Strether became\naware, with this, of what was taking place—that her recognition had\nbeen even stranger for the pair in the boat, that her immediate impulse\nhad been to control it, and that she was quickly and intensely debating\nwith Chad the risk of betrayal. He saw they would show nothing if they\ncould feel sure he hadn’t made them out; so that he had before him for\na few seconds his own hesitation. It was a sharp fantastic crisis that\nhad popped up as if in a dream, and it had had only to last the few\nseconds to make him feel it as quite horrible. They were thus, on\neither side, _trying_ the other side, and all for some reason that\nbroke the stillness like some unprovoked harsh note. It seemed to him\nagain, within the limit, that he had but one thing to do—to settle\ntheir common question by some sign of surprise and joy. He hereupon\ngave large play to these things, agitating his hat and his stick and\nloudly calling out—a demonstration that brought him relief as soon as\nhe had seen it answered. The boat, in mid-stream, still went a little\nwild—which seemed natural, however, while Chad turned round, half\nspringing up; and his good friend, after blankness and wonder, began\ngaily to wave her parasol. Chad dropped afresh to his paddles and the\nboat headed round, amazement and pleasantry filling the air meanwhile,\nand relief, as Strether continued to fancy, superseding mere violence.\nOur friend went down to the water under this odd impression as of\nviolence averted—the violence of their having “cut” him, out there in\nthe eye of nature, on the assumption that he wouldn’t know it. He\nawaited them with a face from which he was conscious of not being able\nquite to banish this idea that they would have gone on, not seeing and\nnot knowing, missing their dinner and disappointing their hostess, had\nhe himself taken a line to match. That at least was what darkened his\nvision for the moment. Afterwards, after they had bumped at the\nlanding-place and he had assisted their getting ashore, everything\nfound itself sponged over by the mere miracle of the encounter.\n\nThey could so much better at last, on either side, treat it as a wild\nextravagance of hazard, that the situation was made elastic by the\namount of explanation called into play. Why indeed—apart from\noddity—the situation should have been really stiff was a question\nnaturally not practical at the moment, and in fact, so far as we are\nconcerned, a question tackled, later on and in private, only by\nStrether himself. He was to reflect later on and in private that it was\nmainly _he_ who had explained—as he had had moreover comparatively\nlittle difficulty in doing. He was to have at all events meanwhile the\nworrying thought of their perhaps secretly suspecting him of having\nplotted this coincidence, taking such pains as might be to give it the\nsemblance of an accident. That possibility—as their imputation—didn’t\nof course bear looking into for an instant; yet the whole incident was\nso manifestly, arrange it as they would, an awkward one, that he could\nscarce keep disclaimers in respect to his own presence from rising to\nhis lips. Disclaimers of intention would have been as tactless as his\npresence was practically gross; and the narrowest escape they either of\nthem had was his lucky escape, in the event, from making any. Nothing\nof the sort, so far as surface and sound were involved, was even in\nquestion; surface and sound all made for their common ridiculous good\nfortune, for the general _invraisemblance_ of the occasion, for the\ncharming chance that they had, the others, in passing, ordered some\nfood to be ready, the charming chance that he had himself not eaten,\nthe charming chance, even more, that their little plans, their hours,\ntheir train, in short, from _là-bas_, would all match for their return\ntogether to Paris. The chance that was most charming of all, the chance\nthat drew from Madame de Vionnet her clearest, gayest “_Comme cela se\ntrouve!_” was the announcement made to Strether after they were seated\nat table, the word given him by their hostess in respect to his\ncarriage for the station, on which he might now count. It settled the\nmatter for his friends as well; the conveyance—it _was_ all too\nlucky!—would serve for them; and nothing was more delightful than his\nbeing in a position to make the train so definite. It might have been,\nfor themselves—to hear Madame de Vionnet—almost unnaturally vague, a\ndetail left to be fixed; though Strether indeed was afterwards to\nremember that Chad had promptly enough intervened to forestall this\nappearance, laughing at his companion’s flightiness and making the\npoint that he had after all, in spite of the bedazzlement of a day out\nwith her, known what he was about.\n\nStrether was to remember afterwards further that this had had for him\nthe effect of forming Chad’s almost sole intervention; and indeed he\nwas to remember further still, in subsequent meditation, many things\nthat, as it were, fitted together. Another of them was for instance\nthat the wonderful woman’s overflow of surprise and amusement was\nwholly into French, which she struck him as speaking with an\nunprecedented command of idiomatic turns, but in which she got, as he\nmight have said, somewhat away from him, taking all at once little\nbrilliant jumps that he could but lamely match. The question of his own\nFrench had never come up for them; it was the one thing she wouldn’t\nhave permitted—it belonged, for a person who had been through much, to\nmere boredom; but the present result was odd, fairly veiling her\nidentity, shifting her back into a mere voluble class or race to the\nintense audibility of which he was by this time inured. When she spoke\nthe charming slightly strange English he best knew her by he seemed to\nfeel her as a creature, among all the millions, with a language quite\nto herself, the real monopoly of a special shade of speech, beautifully\neasy for her, yet of a colour and a cadence that were both inimitable\nand matters of accident. She came back to these things after they had\nshaken down in the inn-parlour and knew, as it were, what was to become\nof them; it was inevitable that loud ejaculation over the prodigy of\ntheir convergence should at last wear itself out. Then it was that his\nimpression took fuller form—the impression, destined only to deepen, to\ncomplete itself, that they had something to put a face upon, to carry\noff and make the best of, and that it was she who, admirably on the\nwhole, was doing this. It was familiar to him of course that they had\nsomething to put a face upon; their friendship, their connexion, took\nany amount of explaining—that would have been made familiar by his\ntwenty minutes with Mrs. Pocock if it hadn’t already been so. Yet his\ntheory, as we know, had bountifully been that the facts were\nspecifically none of his business, and were, over and above, so far as\none had to do with them, intrinsically beautiful; and this might have\nprepared him for anything, as well as rendered him proof against\nmystification. When he reached home that night, however, he knew he had\nbeen, at bottom, neither prepared nor proof; and since we have spoken\nof what he was, after his return, to recall and interpret, it may as\nwell immediately be said that his real experience of these few hours\nput on, in that belated vision—for he scarce went to bed till\nmorning—the aspect that is most to our purpose.\n\nHe then knew more or less how he had been affected—he but half knew at\nthe time. There had been plenty to affect him even after, as has been\nsaid, they had shaken down; for his consciousness, though muffled, had\nits sharpest moments during this passage, a marked drop into innocent\nfriendly Bohemia. They then had put their elbows on the table,\ndeploring the premature end of their two or three dishes; which they\nhad tried to make up with another bottle while Chad joked a little\nspasmodically, perhaps even a little irrelevantly, with the hostess.\nWhat it all came to had been that fiction and fable _were_, inevitably,\nin the air, and not as a simple term of comparison, but as a result of\nthings said; also that they were blinking it, all round, and that they\nyet needn’t, so much as that, have blinked it—though indeed if they\nhadn’t Strether didn’t quite see what else they could have done.\nStrether didn’t quite see _that_ even at an hour or two past midnight,\neven when he had, at his hotel, for a long time, without a light and\nwithout undressing, sat back on his bedroom sofa and stared straight\nbefore him. He was, at that point of vantage, in full possession, to\nmake of it all what he could. He kept making of it that there had been\nsimply a _lie_ in the charming affair—a lie on which one could now,\ndetached and deliberate, perfectly put one’s finger. It was with the\nlie that they had eaten and drunk and talked and laughed, that they had\nwaited for their _carriole_ rather impatiently, and had then got into\nthe vehicle and, sensibly subsiding, driven their three or four miles\nthrough the darkening summer night. The eating and drinking, which had\nbeen a resource, had had the effect of having served its turn; the talk\nand laughter had done as much; and it was during their somewhat tedious\nprogress to the station, during the waits there, the further delays,\ntheir submission to fatigue, their silences in the dim compartment of\nthe much-stopping train, that he prepared himself for reflexions to\ncome. It had been a performance, Madame de Vionnet’s manner, and though\nit had to that degree faltered toward the end, as through her ceasing\nto believe in it, as if she had asked herself, or Chad had found a\nmoment surreptitiously to ask her, what after all was the use, a\nperformance it had none the less quite handsomely remained, with the\nfinal fact about it that it was on the whole easier to keep up than to\nabandon.\n\nFrom the point of view of presence of mind it had been very wonderful\nindeed, wonderful for readiness, for beautiful assurance, for the way\nher decision was taken on the spot, without time to confer with Chad,\nwithout time for anything. Their only conference could have been the\nbrief instants in the boat before they confessed to recognising the\nspectator on the bank, for they hadn’t been alone together a moment\nsince and must have communicated all in silence. It was a part of the\ndeep impression for Strether, and not the least of the deep interest,\nthat they _could_ so communicate—that Chad in particular could let her\nknow he left it to her. He habitually left things to others, as\nStrether was so well aware, and it in fact came over our friend in\nthese meditations that there had been as yet no such vivid illustration\nof his famous knowing how to live. It was as if he had humoured her to\nthe extent of letting her lie without correction—almost as if, really,\nhe would be coming round in the morning to set the matter, as between\nStrether and himself, right. Of course he couldn’t quite come; it was a\ncase in which a man was obliged to accept the woman’s version, even\nwhen fantastic; if she had, with more flurry than she cared to show,\nelected, as the phrase was, to represent that they had left Paris that\nmorning, and with no design but of getting back within the day—if she\nhad so sized-up, in the Woollett phrase, their necessity, she knew best\nher own measure. There were things, all the same, it was impossible to\nblink and which made this measure an odd one—the too evident fact for\ninstance that she hadn’t started out for the day dressed and hatted and\nshod, and even, for that matter, pink parasol’d, as she had been in the\nboat. From what did the drop in her assurance proceed as the tension\nincreased—from what did this slightly baffled ingenuity spring but from\nher consciousness of not presenting, as night closed in, with not so\nmuch as a shawl to wrap her round, an appearance that matched her\nstory? She admitted that she was cold, but only to blame her imprudence\nwhich Chad suffered her to give such account of as she might. Her shawl\nand Chad’s overcoat and her other garments, and his, those they had\neach worn the day before, were at the place, best known to themselves—a\nquiet retreat enough, no doubt—at which they had been spending the\ntwenty-four hours, to which they had fully meant to return that\nevening, from which they had so remarkably swum into Strether’s ken,\nand the tacit repudiation of which had been thus the essence of her\ncomedy. Strether saw how she had perceived in a flash that they\ncouldn’t quite look to going back there under his nose; though,\nhonestly, as he gouged deeper into the matter, he was somewhat\nsurprised, as Chad likewise had perhaps been, at the uprising of this\nscruple. He seemed even to divine that she had entertained it rather\nfor Chad than for herself, and that, as the young man had lacked the\nchance to enlighten her, she had had to go on with it, he meanwhile\nmistaking her motive.\n\nHe was rather glad, none the less, that they had in point of fact not\nparted at the Cheval Blanc, that he hadn’t been reduced to giving them\nhis blessing for an idyllic retreat down the river. He had had in the\nactual case to make-believe more than he liked, but this was nothing,\nit struck him, to what the other event would have required. Could he,\nliterally, quite have faced the other event? Would he have been capable\nof making the best of it with them? This was what he was trying to do\nnow; but with the advantage of his being able to give more time to it a\ngood deal counteracted by his sense of what, over and above the central\nfact itself, he had to swallow. It was the quantity of make-believe\ninvolved and so vividly exemplified that most disagreed with his\nspiritual stomach. He moved, however, from the consideration of that\nquantity—to say nothing of the consciousness of that organ—back to the\nother feature of the show, the deep, deep truth of the intimacy\nrevealed. That was what, in his vain vigil, he oftenest reverted to:\nintimacy, at such a point, was _like_ that—and what in the world else\nwould one have wished it to be like? It was all very well for him to\nfeel the pity of its being so much like lying; he almost blushed, in\nthe dark, for the way he had dressed the possibility in vagueness, as a\nlittle girl might have dressed her doll. He had made them—and by no\nfault of their own—momentarily pull it for him, the possibility, out of\nthis vagueness; and must he not therefore take it now as they had had\nsimply, with whatever thin attenuations, to give it to him? The very\nquestion, it may be added, made him feel lonely and cold. There was the\nelement of the awkward all round, but Chad and Madame de Vionnet had at\nleast the comfort that they could talk it over together. With whom\ncould _he_ talk of such things?—unless indeed always, at almost any\nstage, with Maria? He foresaw that Miss Gostrey would come again into\nrequisition on the morrow; though it wasn’t to be denied that he was\nalready a little afraid of her “What on earth—that’s what I want to\nknow now—had you then supposed?” He recognised at last that he had\nreally been trying all along to suppose nothing. Verily, verily, his\nlabour had been lost. He found himself supposing innumerable and\nwonderful things.\n\n\nBook Twelfth\n\n\n I\n\nStrether couldn’t have said he had during the previous hours definitely\nexpected it; yet when, later on, that morning—though no later indeed\nthan for his coming forth at ten o’clock—he saw the concierge produce,\non his approach, a _petit bleu_ delivered since his letters had been\nsent up, he recognised the appearance as the first symptom of a sequel.\nHe then knew he had been thinking of some early sign from Chad as more\nlikely, after all, than not; and this would be precisely the early\nsign. He took it so for granted that he opened the _petit bleu_ just\nwhere he had stopped, in the pleasant cool draught of the\n_porte-cochère_—only curious to see where the young man would, at such\na juncture, break out. His curiosity, however, was more than gratified;\nthe small missive, whose gummed edge he had detached without attention\nto the address, not being from the young man at all, but from the\nperson whom the case gave him on the spot as still more worth while.\nWorth while or not, he went round to the nearest telegraph-office, the\nbig one on the Boulevard, with a directness that almost confessed to a\nfear of the danger of delay. He might have been thinking that if he\ndidn’t go before he could think he wouldn’t perhaps go at all. He at\nany rate kept, in the lower side-pocket of his morning coat, a very\ndeliberate hand on his blue missive, crumpling it up rather tenderly\nthan harshly. He wrote a reply, on the Boulevard, also in the form of a\n_petit bleu_—which was quickly done, under pressure of the place,\ninasmuch as, like Madame de Vionnet’s own communication, it consisted\nof the fewest words. She had asked him if he could do her the very\ngreat kindness of coming to see her that evening at half-past nine, and\nhe answered, as if nothing were easier, that he would present himself\nat the hour she named. She had added a line of postscript, to the\neffect that she would come to him elsewhere and at his own hour if he\npreferred; but he took no notice of this, feeling that if he saw her at\nall half the value of it would be in seeing her where he had already\nseen her best. He mightn’t see her at all; that was one of the\nreflexions he made after writing and before he dropped his closed card\ninto the box; he mightn’t see any one at all any more at all; he might\nmake an end as well now as ever, leaving things as they were, since he\nwas doubtless not to leave them better, and taking his way home so far\nas should appear that a home remained to him. This alternative was for\na few minutes so sharp that if he at last did deposit his missive it\nwas perhaps because the pressure of the place had an effect.\n\nThere was none other, however, than the common and constant pressure,\nfamiliar to our friend under the rubric of _Postes et Télégraphes_—the\nsomething in the air of these establishments; the vibration of the vast\nstrange life of the town, the influence of the types, the performers\nconcocting their messages; the little prompt Paris women, arranging,\npretexting goodness knew what, driving the dreadful needle-pointed\npublic pen at the dreadful sand-strewn public table: implements that\nsymbolised for Strether’s too interpretative innocence something more\nacute in manners, more sinister in morals, more fierce in the national\nlife. After he had put in his paper he had ranged himself, he was\nreally amused to think, on the side of the fierce, the sinister, the\nacute. He was carrying on a correspondence, across the great city,\nquite in the key of the _Postes et Télégraphes_ in general; and it was\nfairly as if the acceptance of that fact had come from something in his\nstate that sorted with the occupation of his neighbours. He was mixed\nup with the typical tale of Paris, and so were they, poor things—how\ncould they all together help being? They were no worse than he, in\nshort, and he no worse than they—if, queerly enough, no better; and at\nall events he had settled his hash, so that he went out to begin, from\nthat moment, his day of waiting. The great settlement was, as he felt,\nin his preference for seeing his correspondent in her own best\nconditions. _That_ was part of the typical tale, the part most\nsignificant in respect to himself. He liked the place she lived in, the\npicture that each time squared itself, large and high and clear, around\nher: every occasion of seeing it was a pleasure of a different shade.\nYet what precisely was he doing with shades of pleasure now, and why\nhadn’t he properly and logically compelled her to commit herself to\nwhatever of disadvantage and penalty the situation might throw up? He\nmight have proposed, as for Sarah Pocock, the cold hospitality of his\nown _salon de lecture_, in which the chill of Sarah’s visit seemed\nstill to abide and shades of pleasure were dim; he might have suggested\na stone bench in the dusty Tuileries or a penny chair at the back part\nof the Champs Elysées. These things would have been a trifle stern, and\nsternness alone now wouldn’t be sinister. An instinct in him cast about\nfor some form of discipline in which they might meet—some awkwardness\nthey would suffer from, some danger, or at least some grave\ninconvenience, they would incur. This would give a sense—which the\nspirit required, rather ached and sighed in the absence of—that\nsomebody was paying something somewhere and somehow, that they were at\nleast not all floating together on the silver stream of impunity. Just\ninstead of that to go and see her late in the evening, as if, for all\nthe world—well, as if he were as much in the swim as anybody else: this\nhad as little as possible in common with the penal form.\n\nEven when he had felt that objection melt away, however, the practical\ndifference was small; the long stretch of his interval took the colour\nit would, and if he lived on thus with the sinister from hour to hour\nit proved an easier thing than one might have supposed in advance. He\nreverted in thought to his old tradition, the one he had been brought\nup on and which even so many years of life had but little worn away;\nthe notion that the state of the wrongdoer, or at least this person’s\nhappiness, presented some special difficulty. What struck him now\nrather was the ease of it—for nothing in truth appeared easier. It was\nan ease he himself fairly tasted of for the rest of the day; giving\nhimself quite up; not so much as trying to dress it out, in any\nparticular whatever, as a difficulty; not after all going to see\nMaria—which would have been in a manner a result of such dressing; only\nidling, lounging, smoking, sitting in the shade, drinking lemonade and\nconsuming ices. The day had turned to heat and eventual thunder, and he\nnow and again went back to his hotel to find that Chad hadn’t been\nthere. He hadn’t yet struck himself, since leaving Woollett, so much as\na loafer, though there had been times when he believed himself touching\nbottom. This was a deeper depth than any, and with no foresight,\nscarcely with a care, as to what he should bring up. He almost wondered\nif he didn’t _look_ demoralised and disreputable; he had the fanciful\nvision, as he sat and smoked, of some accidental, some motived, return\nof the Pococks, who would be passing along the Boulevard and would\ncatch this view of him. They would have distinctly, on his appearance,\nevery ground for scandal. But fate failed to administer even that\nsternness; the Pococks never passed and Chad made no sign. Strether\nmeanwhile continued to hold off from Miss Gostrey, keeping her till\nto-morrow; so that by evening his irresponsibility, his impunity, his\nluxury, had become—there was no other word for them—immense.\n\nBetween nine and ten, at last, in the high clear picture—he was moving\nin these days, as in a gallery, from clever canvas to clever canvas—he\ndrew a long breath: it was so presented to him from the first that the\nspell of his luxury wouldn’t be broken. He wouldn’t have, that is, to\nbecome responsible—this was admirably in the air: she had sent for him\nprecisely to let him feel it, so that he might go on with the comfort\n(comfort already established, hadn’t it been?) of regarding his ordeal,\nthe ordeal of the weeks of Sarah’s stay and of their climax, as safely\ntraversed and left behind him. Didn’t she just wish to assure him that\n_she_ now took it all and so kept it; that he was absolutely not to\nworry any more, was only to rest on his laurels and continue generously\nto help her? The light in her beautiful formal room was dim, though it\nwould do, as everything would always do; the hot night had kept out\nlamps, but there was a pair of clusters of candles that glimmered over\nthe chimney-piece like the tall tapers of an altar. The windows were\nall open, their redundant hangings swaying a little, and he heard once\nmore, from the empty court, the small plash of the fountain. From\nbeyond this, and as from a great distance—beyond the court, beyond the\n_corps de logis_ forming the front—came, as if excited and exciting,\nthe vague voice of Paris. Strether had all along been subject to sudden\ngusts of fancy in connexion with such matters as these—odd starts of\nthe historic sense, suppositions and divinations with no warrant but\ntheir intensity. Thus and so, on the eve of the great recorded dates,\nthe days and nights of revolution, the sounds had come in, the omens,\nthe beginnings broken out. They were the smell of revolution, the smell\nof the public temper—or perhaps simply the smell of blood.\n\nIt was at present queer beyond words, “subtle,” he would have risked\nsaying, that such suggestions should keep crossing the scene; but it\nwas doubtless the effect of the thunder in the air, which had hung\nabout all day without release. His hostess was dressed as for\nthunderous times, and it fell in with the kind of imagination we have\njust attributed to him that she should be in simplest coolest white, of\na character so old-fashioned, if he were not mistaken, that Madame\nRoland must on the scaffold have worn something like it. This effect\nwas enhanced by a small black fichu or scarf, of crape or gauze,\ndisposed quaintly round her bosom and now completing as by a mystic\ntouch the pathetic, the noble analogy. Poor Strether in fact scarce\nknew what analogy was evoked for him as the charming woman, receiving\nhim and making him, as she could do such things, at once familiarly and\ngravely welcome, moved over her great room with her image almost\nrepeated in its polished floor, which had been fully bared for summer.\nThe associations of the place, all felt again; the gleam here and\nthere, in the subdued light, of glass and gilt and parquet, with the\nquietness of her own note as the centre—these things were at first as\ndelicate as if they had been ghostly, and he was sure in a moment that,\nwhatever he should find he had come for, it wouldn’t be for an\nimpression that had previously failed him. That conviction held him\nfrom the outset, and, seeming singularly to simplify, certified to him\nthat the objects about would help him, would really help them both. No,\nhe might never see them again—this was only too probably the last time;\nand he should certainly see nothing in the least degree like them. He\nshould soon be going to where such things were not, and it would be a\nsmall mercy for memory, for fancy, to have, in that stress, a loaf on\nthe shelf. He knew in advance he should look back on the perception\nactually sharpest with him as on the view of something old, old, old,\nthe oldest thing he had ever personally touched; and he also knew, even\nwhile he took his companion in as the feature among features, that\nmemory and fancy couldn’t help being enlisted for her. She might intend\nwhat she would, but this was beyond anything she could intend, with\nthings from far back—tyrannies of history, facts of type, values, as\nthe painters said, of expression—all working for her and giving her the\nsupreme chance, the chance of the happy, the really luxurious few, the\nchance, on a great occasion, to be natural and simple. She had never,\nwith him, been more so; or if it was the perfection of art it would\nnever—and that came to the same thing—be proved against her.\n\nWhat was truly wonderful was her way of differing so from time to time\nwithout detriment to her simplicity. Caprices, he was sure she felt,\nwere before anything else bad manners, and that judgement in her was by\nitself a thing making more for safety of intercourse than anything that\nin his various own past intercourses he had had to reckon on. If\ntherefore her presence was now quite other than the one she had shown\nhim the night before, there was nothing of violence in the change—it\nwas all harmony and reason. It gave him a mild deep person, whereas he\nhad had on the occasion to which their interview was a direct reference\na person committed to movement and surface and abounding in them; but\nshe was in either character more remarkable for nothing than for her\nbridging of intervals, and this now fell in with what he understood he\nwas to leave to her. The only thing was that, if he was to leave it\n_all_ to her, why exactly had she sent for him? He had had, vaguely, in\nadvance, his explanation, his view of the probability of her wishing to\nset something right, to deal in some way with the fraud so lately\npractised on his presumed credulity. Would she attempt to carry it\nfurther or would she blot it out? Would she throw over it some more or\nless happy colour; or would she do nothing about it at all? He\nperceived soon enough at least that, however reasonable she might be,\nshe wasn’t vulgarly confused, and it herewith pressed upon him that\ntheir eminent “lie,” Chad’s and hers, was simply after all such an\ninevitable tribute to good taste as he couldn’t have wished them not to\nrender. Away from them, during his vigil, he had seemed to wince at the\namount of comedy involved; whereas in his present posture he could only\nask himself how he should enjoy any attempt from her to take the comedy\nback. He shouldn’t enjoy it at all; but, once more and yet once more,\nhe could trust her. That is he could trust her to make deception right.\nAs she presented things the ugliness—goodness knew why—went out of\nthem; none the less too that she could present them, with an art of her\nown, by not so much as touching them. She let the matter, at all\nevents, lie where it was—where the previous twenty-four hours had\nplaced it; appearing merely to circle about it respectfully, tenderly,\nalmost piously, while she took up another question.\n\nShe knew she hadn’t really thrown dust in his eyes; this, the previous\nnight, before they separated, had practically passed between them; and,\nas she had sent for him to see what the difference thus made for him\nmight amount to, so he was conscious at the end of five minutes that he\nhad been tried and tested. She had settled with Chad after he left them\nthat she would, for her satisfaction, assure herself of this quantity,\nand Chad had, as usual, let her have her way. Chad was always letting\npeople have their way when he felt that it would somehow turn his wheel\nfor him; it somehow always did turn his wheel. Strether felt, oddly\nenough, before these facts, freshly and consentingly passive; they\nagain so rubbed it into him that the couple thus fixing his attention\nwere intimate, that his intervention had absolutely aided and\nintensified their intimacy, and that in fine he must accept the\nconsequence of that. He had absolutely become, himself, with his\nperceptions and his mistakes, his concessions and his reserves, the\ndroll mixture, as it must seem to them, of his braveries and his fears,\nthe general spectacle of his art and his innocence, almost an added\nlink and certainly a common priceless ground for them to meet upon. It\nwas as if he had been hearing their very tone when she brought out a\nreference that was comparatively straight. “The last twice that you’ve\nbeen here, you know, I never asked you,” she said with an abrupt\ntransition—they had been pretending before this to talk simply of the\ncharm of yesterday and of the interest of the country they had seen.\nThe effort was confessedly vain; not for such talk had she invited him;\nand her impatient reminder was of their having done for it all the\nneedful on his coming to her after Sarah’s flight. What she hadn’t\nasked him then was to state to her where and how he stood for her; she\nhad been resting on Chad’s report of their midnight hour together in\nthe Boulevard Malesherbes. The thing therefore she at present desired\nwas ushered in by this recall of the two occasions on which,\ndisinterested and merciful, she hadn’t worried him. To-night truly she\n_would_ worry him, and this was her appeal to him to let her risk it.\nHe wasn’t to mind if she bored him a little: she had behaved, after\nall—hadn’t she?—so awfully, awfully well.\n\n\n II\n\n“Oh, you’re all right, you’re all right,” he almost impatiently\ndeclared; his impatience being moreover not for her pressure, but for\nher scruple. More and more distinct to him was the tune to which she\nwould have had the matter out with Chad: more and more vivid for him\nthe idea that she had been nervous as to what he might be able to\n“stand.” Yes, it had been a question if he had “stood” what the scene\non the river had given him, and, though the young man had doubtless\nopined in favour of his recuperation, her own last word must have been\nthat she should feel easier in seeing for herself. That was it,\nunmistakeably; she _was_ seeing for herself. What he could stand was\nthus, in these moments, in the balance for Strether, who reflected, as\nhe became fully aware of it, that he must properly brace himself. He\nwanted fully to appear to stand all he might; and there was a certain\ncommand of the situation for him in this very wish not to look too much\nat sea. She was ready with everything, but so, sufficiently, was he;\nthat is he was at one point the more prepared of the two, inasmuch as,\nfor all her cleverness, she couldn’t produce on the spot—and it was\nsurprising—an account of the motive of her note. He had the advantage\nthat his pronouncing her “all right” gave him for an enquiry. “May I\nask, delighted as I’ve been to come, if you’ve wished to say something\nspecial?” He spoke as if she might have seen he had been waiting for\nit—not indeed with discomfort, but with natural interest. Then he saw\nthat she was a little taken aback, was even surprised herself at the\ndetail she had neglected—the only one ever yet; having somehow assumed\nhe would know, would recognise, would leave some things not to be said.\nShe looked at him, however, an instant as if to convey that if he\nwanted them _all_—!\n\n“Selfish and vulgar—that’s what I must seem to you. You’ve done\neverything for me, and here I am as if I were asking for more. But it\nisn’t,” she went on, “because I’m afraid—though I _am_ of course\nafraid, as a woman in my position always is. I mean it isn’t because\none lives in terror—it isn’t because of that one is selfish, for I’m\nready to give you my word to-night that I don’t care; don’t care what\nstill may happen and what I may lose. I don’t ask you to raise your\nlittle finger for me again, nor do I wish so much as to mention to you\nwhat we’ve talked of before, either my danger or my safety, or his\nmother, or his sister, or the girl he may marry, or the fortune he may\nmake or miss, or the right or the wrong, of any kind, he may do. If\nafter the help one has had from you one can’t either take care of one’s\nself or simply hold one’s tongue, one must renounce all claim to be an\nobject of interest. It’s in the name of what I _do_ care about that\nI’ve tried still to keep hold of you. How can I be indifferent,” she\nasked, “to how I appear to you?” And as he found himself unable\nimmediately to say: “Why, if you’re going, _need_ you, after all? Is it\nimpossible you should stay on—so that one mayn’t lose you?”\n\n“Impossible I should live with you here instead of going home?”\n\n“Not ‘with’ us, if you object to that, but near enough to us,\nsomewhere, for us to see you—well,” she beautifully brought out, “when\nwe feel we _must_. How shall we not sometimes feel it? I’ve wanted to\nsee you often when I couldn’t,” she pursued, “all these last weeks. How\nshan’t I then miss you now, with the sense of your being gone forever?”\nThen as if the straightness of this appeal, taking him unprepared, had\nvisibly left him wondering: “Where _is_ your ‘home’ moreover now—what\nhas become of it? I’ve made a change in your life, I know I have; I’ve\nupset everything in your mind as well; in your sense of—what shall I\ncall it?—all the decencies and possibilities. It gives me a kind of\ndetestation—” She pulled up short.\n\nOh but he wanted to hear. “Detestation of what?”\n\n“Of everything—of life.”\n\n“Ah that’s too much,” he laughed—“or too little!”\n\n“Too little, precisely”—she was eager. “What I hate is myself—when I\nthink that one has to take so much, to be happy, out of the lives of\nothers, and that one isn’t happy even then. One does it to cheat one’s\nself and to stop one’s mouth—but that’s only at the best for a little.\nThe wretched self is always there, always making one somehow a fresh\nanxiety. What it comes to is that it’s not, that it’s never, a\nhappiness, any happiness at all, to _take_. The only safe thing is to\ngive. It’s what plays you least false.” Interesting, touching,\nstrikingly sincere as she let these things come from her, she yet\npuzzled and troubled him—so fine was the quaver of her quietness. He\nfelt what he had felt before with her, that there was always more\nbehind what she showed, and more and more again behind that. “You know\nso, at least,” she added, “where you are!”\n\n“_You_ ought to know it indeed then; for isn’t what you’ve been giving\nexactly what has brought us together this way? You’ve been making, as\nI’ve so fully let you know I’ve felt,” Strether said, “the most\nprecious present I’ve ever seen made, and if you can’t sit down\npeacefully on that performance you _are_, no doubt, born to torment\nyourself. But you ought,” he wound up, “to be easy.”\n\n“And not trouble you any more, no doubt—not thrust on you even the\nwonder and the beauty of what I’ve done; only let you regard our\nbusiness as over, and well over, and see you depart in a peace that\nmatches my own? No doubt, no doubt, no doubt,” she nervously\nrepeated—“all the more that I don’t really pretend I believe you\ncouldn’t, for yourself, _not_ have done what you have. I don’t pretend\nyou feel yourself victimised, for this evidently is the way you live,\nand it’s what—we’re agreed—is the best way. Yes, as you say,” she\ncontinued after a moment, “I ought to be easy and rest on my work. Well\nthen here am I doing so. I _am_ easy. You’ll have it for your last\nimpression. When is it you say you go?” she asked with a quick change.\n\nHe took some time to reply—his last impression was more and more so\nmixed a one. It produced in him a vague disappointment, a drop that was\ndeeper even than the fall of his elation the previous night. The good\nof what he had done, if he had done so much, wasn’t there to enliven\nhim quite to the point that would have been ideal for a grand gay\nfinale. Women were thus endlessly absorbent, and to deal with them was\nto walk on water. What was at bottom the matter with her, embroider as\nshe might and disclaim as she might—what was at bottom the matter with\nher was simply Chad himself. It was of Chad she was after all renewedly\nafraid; the strange strength of her passion was the very strength of\nher fear; she clung to _him_, Lambert Strether, as to a source of\nsafety she had tested, and, generous graceful truthful as she might try\nto be, exquisite as she was, she dreaded the term of his being within\nreach. With this sharpest perception yet, it was like a chill in the\nair to him, it was almost appalling, that a creature so fine could be,\nby mysterious forces, a creature so exploited. For at the end of all\nthings they _were_ mysterious: she had but made Chad what he was—so why\ncould she think she had made him infinite? She had made him better, she\nhad made him best, she had made him anything one would; but it came to\nour friend with supreme queerness that he was none the less only Chad.\nStrether had the sense that _he_, a little, had made him too; his high\nappreciation had as it were, consecrated her work The work, however\nadmirable, was nevertheless of the strict human order, and in short it\nwas marvellous that the companion of mere earthly joys, of comforts,\naberrations (however one classed them) within the common experience\nshould be so transcendently prized. It might have made Strether hot or\nshy, as such secrets of others brought home sometimes do make us; but\nhe was held there by something so hard that it was fairly grim. This\nwas not the discomposure of last night; that had quite passed—such\ndiscomposures were a detail; the real coercion was to see a man\nineffably adored. There it was again—it took women, it took women; if\nto deal with them was to walk on water what wonder that the water rose?\nAnd it had never surely risen higher than round this woman. He\npresently found himself taking a long look from her, and the next thing\nhe knew he had uttered all his thought. “You’re afraid for your life!”\n\nIt drew out her long look, and he soon enough saw why. A spasm came\ninto her face, the tears she had already been unable to hide overflowed\nat first in silence, and then, as the sound suddenly comes from a\nchild, quickened to gasps, to sobs. She sat and covered her face with\nher hands, giving up all attempt at a manner. “It’s how you see me,\nit’s how you see me”—she caught her breath with it—“and it’s as I _am_,\nand as I must take myself, and of course it’s no matter.” Her emotion\nwas at first so incoherent that he could only stand there at a loss,\nstand with his sense of having upset her, though of having done it by\nthe truth. He had to listen to her in a silence that he made no\nimmediate effort to attenuate, feeling her doubly woeful amid all her\ndim diffused elegance; consenting to it as he had consented to the\nrest, and even conscious of some vague inward irony in the presence of\nsuch a fine free range of bliss and bale. He couldn’t say it was _not_\nno matter; for he was serving her to the end, he now knew, anyway—quite\nas if what he thought of her had nothing to do with it. It was actually\nmoreover as if he didn’t think of her at all, as if he could think of\nnothing but the passion, mature, abysmal, pitiful, she represented, and\nthe possibilities she betrayed. She was older for him to-night, visibly\nless exempt from the touch of time; but she was as much as ever the\nfinest and subtlest creature, the happiest apparition, it had been\ngiven him, in all his years, to meet; and yet he could see her there as\nvulgarly troubled, in very truth, as a maidservant crying for her young\nman. The only thing was that she judged herself as the maidservant\nwouldn’t; the weakness of which wisdom too, the dishonour of which\njudgement, seemed but to sink her lower. Her collapse, however, no\ndoubt, was briefer and she had in a manner recovered herself before he\nintervened. “Of course I’m afraid for my life. But that’s nothing. It\nisn’t that.”\n\nHe was silent a little longer, as if thinking what it might be.\n“There’s something I have in mind that I can still do.”\n\nBut she threw off at last, with a sharp sad headshake, drying her eyes,\nwhat he could still do. “I don’t care for that. Of course, as I’ve\nsaid, you’re acting, in your wonderful way, for yourself; and what’s\nfor yourself is no more my business—though I may reach out unholy hands\nso clumsily to touch it—than if it were something in Timbuctoo. It’s\nonly that you don’t snub me, as you’ve had fifty chances to do—it’s\nonly your beautiful patience that makes one forget one’s manners. In\nspite of your patience, all the same,” she went on, “you’d do anything\nrather than be with us here, even if that were possible. You’d do\neverything for us but be mixed up with us—which is a statement you can\neasily answer to the advantage of your own manners. You can say ‘What’s\nthe use of talking of things that at the best are impossible?’ What\n_is_ of course the use? It’s only my little madness. You’d talk if you\nwere tormented. And I don’t mean now about _him_. Oh for him—!”\nPositively, strangely, bitterly, as it seemed to Strether, she gave\n“him,” for the moment, away. “You don’t care what I think of you; but I\nhappen to care what you think of me. And what you _might_,” she added.\n“What you perhaps even did.”\n\nHe gained time. “What I did—?”\n\n“Did think before. Before this. _Didn’t_ you think—?”\n\nBut he had already stopped her. “I didn’t think anything. I never think\na step further than I’m obliged to.”\n\n“That’s perfectly false, I believe,” she returned—“except that you may,\nno doubt, often pull up when things become _too_ ugly; or even, I’ll\nsay, to save you a protest, too beautiful. At any rate, even so far as\nit’s true, we’ve thrust on you appearances that you’ve had to take in\nand that have therefore made your obligation. Ugly or beautiful—it\ndoesn’t matter what we call them—you were getting on without them, and\nthat’s where we’re detestable. We bore you—that’s where we are. And we\nmay well—for what we’ve cost you. All you can do _now_ is not to think\nat all. And I who should have liked to seem to you—well, sublime!”\n\nHe could only after a moment re-echo Miss Barrace. “You’re wonderful!”\n\n“I’m old and abject and hideous”—she went on as without hearing him.\n“Abject above all. Or old above all. It’s when one’s old that it’s\nworst. I don’t care what becomes of it—let what _will_; there it is.\nIt’s a doom—I know it; you can’t see it more than I do myself. Things\nhave to happen as they will.” With which she came back again to what,\nface to face with him, had so quite broken down. “Of course you\nwouldn’t, even if possible, and no matter what may happen to you, be\nnear us. But think of me, think of me—!” She exhaled it into air.\n\nHe took refuge in repeating something he had already said and that she\nhad made nothing of. “There’s something I believe I can still do.” And\nhe put his hand out for good-bye.\n\nShe again made nothing of it; she went on with her insistence. “That\nwon’t help you. There’s nothing to help you.”\n\n“Well, it may help _you_,” he said.\n\nShe shook her head. “There’s not a grain of certainty in my future—for\nthe only certainty is that I shall be the loser in the end.”\n\nShe hadn’t taken his hand, but she moved with him to the door. “That’s\ncheerful,” he laughed, “for your benefactor!”\n\n“What’s cheerful for _me_,” she replied, “is that we might, you and I,\nhave been friends. That’s it—that’s it. You see how, as I say, I want\neverything. I’ve wanted you too.”\n\n“Ah but you’ve _had_ me!” he declared, at the door, with an emphasis\nthat made an end.\n\n\n III\n\nHis purpose had been to see Chad the next day, and he had prefigured\nseeing him by an early call; having in general never stood on ceremony\nin respect to visits at the Boulevard Malesherbes. It had been more\noften natural for him to go there than for Chad to come to the small\nhotel, the attractions of which were scant; yet it nevertheless, just\nnow, at the eleventh hour, did suggest itself to Strether to begin by\ngiving the young man a chance. It struck him that, in the inevitable\ncourse, Chad would be “round,” as Waymarsh used to say—Waymarsh who\nalready, somehow, seemed long ago. He hadn’t come the day before,\nbecause it had been arranged between them that Madame de Vionnet should\nsee their friend first; but now that this passage had taken place he\nwould present himself, and their friend wouldn’t have long to wait.\nStrether assumed, he became aware, on this reasoning, that the\ninteresting parties to the arrangement would have met betimes, and that\nthe more interesting of the two—as she was after all—would have\ncommunicated to the other the issue of her appeal. Chad would know\nwithout delay that his mother’s messenger had been with her, and,\nthough it was perhaps not quite easy to see how she could qualify what\nhad occurred, he would at least have been sufficiently advised to feel\nhe could go on. The day, however, brought, early or late, no word from\nhim, and Strether felt, as a result of this, that a change had\npractically come over their intercourse. It was perhaps a premature\njudgement; or it only meant perhaps—how could he tell?—that the\nwonderful pair he protected had taken up again together the excursion\nhe had accidentally checked. They might have gone back to the country,\nand gone back but with a long breath drawn; that indeed would best mark\nChad’s sense that reprobation hadn’t rewarded Madame de Vionnet’s\nrequest for an interview. At the end of the twenty-four hours, at the\nend of the forty-eight, there was still no overture; so that Strether\nfilled up the time, as he had so often filled it before, by going to\nsee Miss Gostrey.\n\nHe proposed amusements to her; he felt expert now in proposing\namusements; and he had thus, for several days, an odd sense of leading\nher about Paris, of driving her in the Bois, of showing her the penny\nsteamboats—those from which the breeze of the Seine was to be best\nenjoyed—that might have belonged to a kindly uncle doing the honours of\nthe capital to an intelligent niece from the country. He found means\neven to take her to shops she didn’t know, or that she pretended she\ndidn’t; while she, on her side, was, like the country maiden, all\npassive modest and grateful—going in fact so far as to emulate\nrusticity in occasional fatigues and bewilderments. Strether described\nthese vague proceedings to himself, described them even to her, as a\nhappy interlude; the sign of which was that the companions said for the\ntime no further word about the matter they had talked of to satiety. He\nproclaimed satiety at the outset, and she quickly took the hint; as\ndocile both in this and in everything else as the intelligent obedient\nniece. He told her as yet nothing of his late adventure—for as an\nadventure it now ranked with him; he pushed the whole business\ntemporarily aside and found his interest in the fact of her beautiful\nassent. She left questions unasked—she who for so long had been all\nquestions; she gave herself up to him with an understanding of which\nmere mute gentleness might have seemed the sufficient expression. She\nknew his sense of his situation had taken still another step—of that he\nwas quite aware; but she conveyed that, whatever had thus happened for\nhim, it was thrown into the shade by what was happening for herself.\nThis—though it mightn’t to a detached spirit have seemed much—was the\nmajor interest, and she met it with a new directness of response,\nmeasuring it from hour to hour with her grave hush of acceptance.\nTouched as he had so often been by her before, he was, for his part\ntoo, touched afresh; all the more that though he could be duly aware of\nthe principle of his own mood he couldn’t be equally so of the\nprinciple of hers. He knew, that is, in a manner—knew roughly and\nresignedly—what he himself was hatching; whereas he had to take the\nchance of what he called to himself Maria’s calculations. It was all he\nneeded that she liked him enough for what they were doing, and even\nshould they do a good deal more would still like him enough for that;\nthe essential freshness of a relation so simple was a cool bath to the\nsoreness produced by other relations. These others appeared to him now\nhorribly complex; they bristled with fine points, points all\nunimaginable beforehand, points that pricked and drew blood; a fact\nthat gave to an hour with his present friend on a _bateau-mouche_, or\nin the afternoon shade of the Champs Elysées, something of the innocent\npleasure of handling rounded ivory. His relation with Chad\npersonally—from the moment he had got his point of view—had been of the\nsimplest; yet this also struck him as bristling, after a third and a\nfourth blank day had passed. It was as if at last however his care for\nsuch indications had dropped; there came a fifth blank day and he\nceased to enquire or to heed.\n\nThey now took on to his fancy, Miss Gostrey and he, the image of the\nBabes in the Wood; they could trust the merciful elements to let them\ncontinue at peace. He had been great already, as he knew, at\npostponements; but he had only to get afresh into the rhythm of one to\nfeel its fine attraction. It amused him to say to himself that he might\nfor all the world have been going to die—die resignedly; the scene was\nfilled for him with so deep a death-bed hush, so melancholy a charm.\nThat meant the postponement of everything else—which made so for the\nquiet lapse of life; and the postponement in especial of the reckoning\nto come—unless indeed the reckoning to come were to be one and the same\nthing with extinction. It faced him, the reckoning, over the shoulder\nof much interposing experience—which also faced him; and one would\nfloat to it doubtless duly through these caverns of Kubla Khan. It was\nreally behind everything; it hadn’t merged in what he had done; his\nfinal appreciation of what he had done—his appreciation on the\nspot—would provide it with its main sharpness. The spot so focussed was\nof course Woollett, and he was to see, at the best, what Woollett would\nbe with everything there changed for him. Wouldn’t _that_ revelation\npractically amount to the wind-up of his career? Well, the summer’s end\nwould show; his suspense had meanwhile exactly the sweetness of vain\ndelay; and he had with it, we should mention, other pastimes than\nMaria’s company—plenty of separate musings in which his luxury failed\nhim but at one point. He was well in port, the outer sea behind him,\nand it was only a matter of getting ashore. There was a question that\ncame and went for him, however, as he rested against the side of his\nship, and it was a little to get rid of the obsession that he prolonged\nhis hours with Miss Gostrey. It was a question about himself, but it\ncould only be settled by seeing Chad again; it was indeed his principal\nreason for wanting to see Chad. After that it wouldn’t signify—it was a\nghost that certain words would easily lay to rest. Only the young man\nmust be there to take the words. Once they were taken he wouldn’t have\na question left; none, that is, in connexion with this particular\naffair. It wouldn’t then matter even to himself that he might now have\nbeen guilty of speaking _because_ of what he had forfeited. That was\nthe refinement of his supreme scruple—he wished so to leave what he had\nforfeited out of account. He wished not to do anything because he had\nmissed something else, because he was sore or sorry or impoverished,\nbecause he was maltreated or desperate; he wished to do everything\nbecause he was lucid and quiet, just the same for himself on all\nessential points as he had ever been. Thus it was that while he\nvirtually hung about for Chad he kept mutely putting it: “You’ve been\nchucked, old boy; but what has that to do with it?” It would have\nsickened him to feel vindictive.\n\nThese tints of feeling indeed were doubtless but the iridescence of his\nidleness, and they were presently lost in a new light from Maria. She\nhad a fresh fact for him before the week was out, and she practically\nmet him with it on his appearing one night. He hadn’t on this day seen\nher, but had planned presenting himself in due course to ask her to\ndine with him somewhere out of doors, on one of the terraces, in one of\nthe gardens, of which the Paris of summer was profuse. It had then come\non to rain, so that, disconcerted, he changed his mind; dining alone at\nhome, a little stuffily and stupidly, and waiting on her afterwards to\nmake up his loss. He was sure within a minute that something had\nhappened; it was so in the air of the rich little room that he had\nscarcely to name his thought. Softly lighted, the whole colour of the\nplace, with its vague values, was in cool fusion—an effect that made\nthe visitor stand for a little agaze. It was as if in doing so now he\nhad felt a recent presence—his recognition of the passage of which his\nhostess in turn divined. She had scarcely to say it—“Yes, she has been\nhere, and this time I received her.” It wasn’t till a minute later that\nshe added: “There being, as I understand you, no reason _now_—!”\n\n“None for your refusing?”\n\n“No—if you’ve done what you’ve had to do.”\n\n“I’ve certainly so far done it,” Strether said, “as that you needn’t\nfear the effect, or the appearance of coming between us. There’s\nnothing between us now but what we ourselves have put there, and not an\ninch of room for anything else whatever. Therefore you’re only\nbeautifully _with_ us as always—though doubtless now, if she has talked\nto you, rather more with us than less. Of course if she came,” he\nadded, “it was to talk to you.”\n\n“It was to talk to me,” Maria returned; on which he was further sure\nthat she was practically in possession of what he himself hadn’t yet\ntold her. He was even sure she was in possession of things he himself\ncouldn’t have told; for the consciousness of them was now all in her\nface and accompanied there with a shade of sadness that marked in her\nthe close of all uncertainties. It came out for him more than ever yet\nthat she had had from the first a knowledge she believed him not to\nhave had, a knowledge the sharp acquisition of which might be destined\nto make a difference for him. The difference for him might not\ninconceivably be an arrest of his independence and a change in his\nattitude—in other words a revulsion in favour of the principles of\nWoollett. She had really prefigured the possibility of a shock that\nwould send him swinging back to Mrs. Newsome. He hadn’t, it was true,\nweek after week, shown signs of receiving it, but the possibility had\nbeen none the less in the air. What Maria accordingly had had now to\ntake in was that the shock had descended and that he hadn’t, all the\nsame, swung back. He had grown clear, in a flash, on a point long since\nsettled for herself; but no reapproximation to Mrs. Newsome had\noccurred in consequence. Madame de Vionnet had by her visit held up the\ntorch to these truths, and what now lingered in poor Maria’s face was\nthe somewhat smoky light of the scene between them. If the light\nhowever wasn’t, as we have hinted, the glow of joy, the reasons for\nthis also were perhaps discernible to Strether even through the blur\ncast over them by his natural modesty. She had held herself for months\nwith a firm hand; she hadn’t interfered on any chance—and chances were\nspecious enough—that she might interfere to her profit. She had turned\nher back on the dream that Mrs. Newsome’s rupture, their friend’s\nforfeiture—the engagement, the relation itself, broken beyond all\nmending—might furnish forth her advantage; and, to stay her hand from\npromoting these things, she had on private, difficult, but rigid,\nlines, played strictly fair. She couldn’t therefore but feel that,\nthough, as the end of all, the facts in question had been stoutly\nconfirmed, her ground for personal, for what might have been called\ninterested, elation remained rather vague. Strether might easily have\nmade out that she had been asking herself, in the hours she had just\nsat through, if there were still for her, or were only not, a fair\nshade of uncertainty. Let us hasten to add, however, that what he at\nfirst made out on this occasion he also at first kept to himself. He\nonly asked what in particular Madame de Vionnet had come for, and as to\nthis his companion was ready.\n\n“She wants tidings of Mr. Newsome, whom she appears not to have seen\nfor some days.”\n\n“Then she hasn’t been away with him again?”\n\n“She seemed to think,” Maria answered, “that he might have gone away\nwith _you_.”\n\n“And did you tell her I know nothing of him?”\n\nShe had her indulgent headshake. “I’ve known nothing of what you know.\nI could only tell her I’d ask you.”\n\n“Then I’ve not seen him for a week—and of course I’ve wondered.” His\nwonderment showed at this moment as sharper, but he presently went on.\n“Still, I dare say I can put my hand on him. Did she strike you,” he\nasked, “as anxious?”\n\n“She’s always anxious.”\n\n“After all I’ve done for her?” And he had one of the last flickers of\nhis occasional mild mirth. “To think that was just what I came out to\nprevent!”\n\nShe took it up but to reply. “You don’t regard him then as safe?”\n\n“I was just going to ask you how in that respect you regard Madame de\nVionnet.”\n\nShe looked at him a little. “What woman was _ever_ safe? She told me,”\nshe added—and it was as if at the touch of the connexion—“of your\nextraordinary meeting in the country. After that _à quoi se fier?_”\n\n“It was, as an accident, in all the possible or impossible chapter,”\nStrether conceded, “amazing enough. But still, but still—!”\n\n“But still she didn’t mind?”\n\n“She doesn’t mind anything.”\n\n“Well, then, as you don’t either, we may all sink to rest!”\n\nHe appeared to agree with her, but he had his reservation. “I do mind\nChad’s disappearance.”\n\n“Oh you’ll get him back. But now you know,” she said, “why I went to\nMentone.” He had sufficiently let her see that he had by this time\ngathered things together, but there was nature in her wish to make them\nclearer still. “I didn’t want you to put it to me.”\n\n“To put it to you—?”\n\n“The question of what you were at last—a week ago—to see for yourself.\nI didn’t want to have to lie for her. I felt that to be too much for\nme. A man of course is always expected to do it—to do it, I mean, for a\nwoman; but not a woman for another woman; unless perhaps on the\ntit-for-tat principle, as an indirect way of protecting herself. I\ndon’t need protection, so that I was free to ‘funk’ you—simply to dodge\nyour test. The responsibility was too much for me. I gained time, and\nwhen I came back the need of a test had blown over.”\n\nStrether thought of it serenely. “Yes; when you came back little Bilham\nhad shown me what’s expected of a gentleman. Little Bilham had lied\nlike one.”\n\n“And like what you believed him?”\n\n“Well,” said Strether, “it was but a technical lie—he classed the\nattachment as virtuous. That was a view for which there was much to be\nsaid—and the virtue came out for me hugely There was of course a great\ndeal of it. I got it full in the face, and I haven’t, you see, done\nwith it yet.”\n\n“What I see, what I saw,” Maria returned, “is that you dressed up even\nthe virtue. You were wonderful—you were beautiful, as I’ve had the\nhonour of telling you before; but, if you wish really to know,” she\nsadly confessed, “I never quite knew _where_ you were. There were\nmoments,” she explained, “when you struck me as grandly cynical; there\nwere others when you struck me as grandly vague.”\n\nHer friend considered. “I had phases. I had flights.”\n\n“Yes, but things must have a basis.”\n\n“A basis seemed to me just what her beauty supplied.”\n\n“Her beauty of person?”\n\n“Well, her beauty of everything. The impression she makes. She has such\nvariety and yet such harmony.”\n\nShe considered him with one of her deep returns of indulgence—returns\nout of all proportion to the irritations they flooded over. “You’re\ncomplete.”\n\n“You’re always too personal,” he good-humouredly said; “but that’s\nprecisely how I wondered and wandered.”\n\n“If you mean,” she went on, “that she was from the first for you the\nmost charming woman in the world, nothing’s more simple. Only that was\nan odd foundation.”\n\n“For what I reared on it?”\n\n“For what you didn’t!”\n\n“Well, it was all not a fixed quantity. And it had for me—it has\nstill—such elements of strangeness. Her greater age than his, her\ndifferent world, traditions, association; her other opportunities,\nliabilities, standards.”\n\nHis friend listened with respect to his enumeration of these\ndisparities; then she disposed of them at a stroke. “Those things are\nnothing when a woman’s hit. It’s very awful. She was hit.”\n\nStrether, on his side, did justice to that plea. “Oh of course I saw\nshe was hit. That she was hit was what we were busy with; that she was\nhit was our great affair. But somehow I couldn’t think of her as down\nin the dust. And as put there by _our_ little Chad!”\n\n“Yet wasn’t ‘your’ little Chad just your miracle?”\n\nStrether admitted it. “Of course I moved among miracles. It was all\nphantasmagoric. But the great fact was that so much of it was none of\nmy business—as I saw my business. It isn’t even now.”\n\nHis companion turned away on this, and it might well have been yet\nagain with the sharpness of a fear of how little his philosophy could\nbring her personally. “I wish _she_ could hear you!”\n\n“Mrs. Newsome?”\n\n“No—not Mrs. Newsome; since I understand you that it doesn’t matter now\nwhat Mrs. Newsome hears. Hasn’t she heard everything?”\n\n“Practically—yes.” He had thought a moment, but he went on. “You wish\nMadame de Vionnet could hear me?”\n\n“Madame de Vionnet.” She had come back to him. “She thinks just the\ncontrary of what you say. That you distinctly judge her.”\n\nHe turned over the scene as the two women thus placed together for him\nseemed to give it. “She might have known—!”\n\n“Might have known you don’t?” Miss Gostrey asked as he let it drop.\n“She was sure of it at first,” she pursued as he said nothing; “she\ntook it for granted, at least, as any woman in her position would. But\nafter that she changed her mind; she believed you believed—”\n\n“Well?”—he was curious.\n\n“Why in her sublimity. And that belief had remained with her, I make\nout, till the accident of the other day opened your eyes. For that it\ndid,” said Maria, “open them—”\n\n“She can’t help”—he had taken it up—“being aware? No,” he mused; “I\nsuppose she thinks of that even yet.”\n\n“Then they _were_ closed? There you are! However, if you see her as the\nmost charming woman in the world it comes to the same thing. And if\nyou’d like me to tell her that you do still so see her—!” Miss Gostrey,\nin short, offered herself for service to the end.\n\nIt was an offer he could temporarily entertain; but he decided. “She\nknows perfectly how I see her.”\n\n“Not favourably enough, she mentioned to me, to wish ever to see her\nagain. She told me you had taken a final leave of her. She says you’ve\ndone with her.”\n\n“So I have.”\n\nMaria had a pause; then she spoke as if for conscience. “She wouldn’t\nhave done with _you_. She feels she has lost you—yet that she might\nhave been better for you.”\n\n“Oh she has been quite good enough!” Strether laughed.\n\n“She thinks you and she might at any rate have been friends.”\n\n“We might certainly. That’s just”—he continued to laugh—“why I’m\ngoing.”\n\nIt was as if Maria could feel with this then at last that she had done\nher best for each. But she had still an idea. “Shall I tell her that?”\n\n“No. Tell her nothing.”\n\n“Very well then.” To which in the next breath Miss Gostrey added: “Poor\ndear thing!”\n\nHer friend wondered; then with raised eyebrows: “Me?”\n\n“Oh no. Marie de Vionnet.”\n\nHe accepted the correction, but he wondered still. “Are you so sorry\nfor her as that?”\n\nIt made her think a moment—made her even speak with a smile. But she\ndidn’t really retract. “I’m sorry for us all!”\n\n\n IV\n\nHe was to delay no longer to re-establish communication with Chad, and\nwe have just seen that he had spoken to Miss Gostrey of this intention\non hearing from her of the young man’s absence. It was not moreover\nonly the assurance so given that prompted him; it was the need of\ncausing his conduct to square with another profession still—the motive\nhe had described to her as his sharpest for now getting away. If he was\nto get away because of some of the relations involved in staying, the\ncold attitude toward them might look pedantic in the light of lingering\non. He must do both things; he must see Chad, but he must go. The more\nhe thought of the former of these duties the more he felt himself make\na subject of insistence of the latter. They were alike intensely\npresent to him as he sat in front of a quiet little café into which he\nhad dropped on quitting Maria’s entresol. The rain that had spoiled his\nevening with her was over; for it was still to him as if his evening\n_had_ been spoiled—though it mightn’t have been wholly the rain. It was\nlate when he left the café, yet not too late; he couldn’t in any case\ngo straight to bed, and he would walk round by the Boulevard\nMalesherbes—rather far round—on his way home. Present enough always was\nthe small circumstance that had originally pressed for him the spring\nof so big a difference—the accident of little Bilham’s appearance on\nthe balcony of the mystic troisième at the moment of his first visit,\nand the effect of it on his sense of what was then before him. He\nrecalled his watch, his wait, and the recognition that had proceeded\nfrom the young stranger, that had played frankly into the air and had\npresently brought him up—things smoothing the way for his first\nstraight step. He had since had occasion, a few times, to pass the\nhouse without going in; but he had never passed it without again\nfeeling how it had then spoken to him. He stopped short to-night on\ncoming to sight of it: it was as if his last day were oddly copying his\nfirst. The windows of Chad’s apartment were open to the balcony—a pair\nof them lighted; and a figure that had come out and taken up little\nBilham’s attitude, a figure whose cigarette-spark he could see leaned\non the rail and looked down at him. It denoted however no reappearance\nof his younger friend; it quickly defined itself in the tempered\ndarkness as Chad’s more solid shape; so that Chad’s was the attention\nthat after he had stepped forward into the street and signalled, he\neasily engaged; Chad’s was the voice that, sounding into the night with\npromptness and seemingly with joy, greeted him and called him up.\n\nThat the young man had been visible there just in this position\nexpressed somehow for Strether that, as Maria Gostrey had reported, he\nhad been absent and silent; and our friend drew breath on each\nlanding—the lift, at that hour, having ceased to work—before the\nimplications of the fact. He had been for a week intensely away, away\nto a distance and alone; but he was more back than ever, and the\nattitude in which Strether had surprised him was something more than a\nreturn—it was clearly a conscious surrender. He had arrived but an hour\nbefore, from London, from Lucerne, from Homburg, from no matter\nwhere—though the visitor’s fancy, on the staircase, liked to fill it\nout; and after a bath, a talk with Baptiste and a supper of light cold\nclever French things, which one could see the remains of there in the\ncircle of the lamp, pretty and ultra-Parisian, he had come into the air\nagain for a smoke, was occupied at the moment of Strether’s approach in\nwhat might have been called taking up his life afresh. His life, his\nlife!—Strether paused anew, on the last flight, at this final rather\nbreathless sense of what Chad’s life was doing with Chad’s mother’s\nemissary. It was dragging him, at strange hours, up the staircases of\nthe rich; it was keeping him out of bed at the end of long hot days; it\nwas transforming beyond recognition the simple, subtle, conveniently\nuniform thing that had anciently passed with him for a life of his own.\nWhy should it concern him that Chad was to be fortified in the pleasant\npractice of smoking on balconies, of supping on salads, of feeling his\nspecial conditions agreeably reaffirm themselves, of finding\nreassurance in comparisons and contrasts? There was no answer to such a\nquestion but that he was still practically committed—he had perhaps\nnever yet so much known it. It made him feel old, and he would buy his\nrailway-ticket—feeling, no doubt, older—the next day; but he had\nmeanwhile come up four flights, counting the entresol, at midnight and\nwithout a lift, for Chad’s life. The young man, hearing him by this\ntime, and with Baptiste sent to rest, was already at the door; so that\nStrether had before him in full visibility the cause in which he was\nlabouring and even, with the troisième fairly gained, panting a little.\n\nChad offered him, as always, a welcome in which the cordial and the\nformal—so far as the formal was the respectful—handsomely met; and\nafter he had expressed a hope that he would let him put him up for the\nnight Strether was in full possession of the key, as it might have been\ncalled, to what had lately happened. If he had just thought of himself\nas old Chad was at sight of him thinking of him as older: he wanted to\nput him up for the night just because he was ancient and weary. It\ncould never be said the tenant of these quarters wasn’t nice to him; a\ntenant who, if he might indeed now keep him, was probably prepared to\nwork it all still more thoroughly. Our friend had in fact the\nimpression that with the minimum of encouragement Chad would propose to\nkeep him indefinitely; an impression in the lap of which one of his own\npossibilities seemed to sit. Madame de Vionnet had wished him to\nstay—so why didn’t that happily fit? He could enshrine himself for the\nrest of his days in his young host’s _chambre d’ami_ and draw out these\ndays at his young host’s expense: there could scarce be greater logical\nexpression of the countenance he had been moved to give. There was\nliterally a minute—it was strange enough—during which he grasped the\nidea that as he _was_ acting, as he could only act, he was\ninconsistent. The sign that the inward forces he had obeyed really hung\ntogether would be that—in default always of another career—he should\npromote the good cause by mounting guard on it. These things, during\nhis first minutes, came and went; but they were after all practically\ndisposed of as soon as he had mentioned his errand. He had come to say\ngood-bye—yet that was only a part; so that from the moment Chad\naccepted his farewell the question of a more ideal affirmation gave way\nto something else. He proceeded with the rest of his business. “You’ll\nbe a brute, you know—you’ll be guilty of the last infamy—if you ever\nforsake her.”\n\nThat, uttered there at the solemn hour, uttered in the place that was\nfull of her influence, was the rest of his business; and when once he\nhad heard himself say it he felt that his message had never before been\nspoken. It placed his present call immediately on solid ground, and the\neffect of it was to enable him quite to play with what we have called\nthe key. Chad showed no shade of embarrassment, but had none the less\nbeen troubled for him after their meeting in the country; had had fears\nand doubts on the subject of his comfort. He was disturbed, as it were,\nonly _for_ him, and had positively gone away to ease him off, to let\nhim down—if it wasn’t indeed rather to screw him up—the more gently.\nSeeing him now fairly jaded he had come, with characteristic good\nhumour, all the way to meet him, and what Strether thereupon supremely\nmade out was that he would abound for him to the end in conscientious\nassurances. This was what was between them while the visitor remained;\nso far from having to go over old ground he found his entertainer keen\nto agree to everything. It couldn’t be put too strongly for him that\nhe’d be a brute. “Oh rather!—if I should do anything of _that_ sort. I\nhope you believe I really feel it.”\n\n“I want it,” said Strether, “to be my last word of all to you. I can’t\nsay more, you know; and I don’t see how I can do more, in every way,\nthan I’ve done.”\n\nChad took this, almost artlessly, as a direct allusion. “You’ve seen\nher?”\n\n“Oh yes—to say good-bye. And if I had doubted the truth of what I tell\nyou—”\n\n“She’d have cleared up your doubt?” Chad understood—“rather”—again! It\neven kept him briefly silent. But he made that up. “She must have been\nwonderful.”\n\n“She _was_,” Strether candidly admitted—all of which practically told\nas a reference to the conditions created by the accident of the\nprevious week.\n\nThey appeared for a little to be looking back at it; and that came out\nstill more in what Chad next said. “I don’t know what you’ve really\nthought, all along; I never did know—for anything, with you, seemed to\nbe possible. But of course—of course—” Without confusion, quite with\nnothing but indulgence, he broke down, he pulled up. “After all, you\nunderstand. I spoke to you originally only as I _had_ to speak. There’s\nonly one way—isn’t there?—about such things. However,” he smiled with a\nfinal philosophy, “I see it’s all right.”\n\nStrether met his eyes with a sense of multiplying thoughts. What was it\nthat made him at present, late at night and after journeys, so\nrenewedly, so substantially young? Strether saw in a moment what it\nwas—it was that he was younger again than Madame de Vionnet. He himself\nsaid immediately none of the things that he was thinking; he said\nsomething quite different. “You _have_ really been to a distance?”\n\n“I’ve been to England.” Chad spoke cheerfully and promptly, but gave no\nfurther account of it than to say: “One must sometimes get off.”\n\nStrether wanted no more facts—he only wanted to justify, as it were,\nhis question. “Of course you do as you’re free to do. But I hope, this\ntime, that you didn’t go for _me_.”\n\n“For very shame at bothering you really too much? My dear man,” Chad\nlaughed, “what _wouldn’t_ I do for you?”\n\nStrether’s easy answer for this was that it was a disposition he had\nexactly come to profit by. “Even at the risk of being in your way I’ve\nwaited on, you know, for a definite reason.”\n\nChad took it in. “Oh yes—for us to make if possible a still better\nimpression.” And he stood there happily exhaling his full general\nconsciousness. “I’m delighted to gather that you feel we’ve made it.”\n\nThere was a pleasant irony in the words, which his guest, preoccupied\nand keeping to the point, didn’t take up. “If I had my sense of wanting\nthe rest of the time—the time of their being still on this side,” he\ncontinued to explain—“I know now why I wanted it.”\n\nHe was as grave, as distinct, as a demonstrator before a blackboard,\nand Chad continued to face him like an intelligent pupil. “You wanted\nto have been put through the whole thing.”\n\nStrether again, for a moment, said nothing; he turned his eyes away,\nand they lost themselves, through the open window, in the dusky outer\nair. “I shall learn from the Bank here where they’re now having their\nletters, and my last word, which I shall write in the morning and which\nthey’re expecting as my ultimatum, will so immediately reach them.” The\nlight of his plural pronoun was sufficiently reflected in his\ncompanion’s face as he again met it; and he completed his\ndemonstration. He pursued indeed as if for himself. “Of course I’ve\nfirst to justify what I shall do.”\n\n“You’re justifying it beautifully!” Chad declared.\n\n“It’s not a question of advising you not to go,” Strether said, “but of\nabsolutely preventing you, if possible, from so much as thinking of it.\nLet me accordingly appeal to you by all you hold sacred.”\n\nChad showed a surprise. “What makes you think me capable—?”\n\n“You’d not only be, as I say, a brute; you’d be,” his companion went on\nin the same way, “a criminal of the deepest dye.”\n\nChad gave a sharper look, as if to gauge a possible suspicion. “I don’t\nknow what should make you think I’m tired of her.”\n\nStrether didn’t quite know either, and such impressions, for the\nimaginative mind, were always too fine, too floating, to produce on the\nspot their warrant. There was none the less for him, in the very manner\nof his host’s allusion to satiety as a thinkable motive, a slight\nbreath of the ominous. “I feel how much more she can do for you. She\nhasn’t done it all yet. Stay with her at least till she has.”\n\n“And leave her _then?_”\n\nChad had kept smiling, but its effect in Strether was a shade of\ndryness. “Don’t leave her _before_. When you’ve got all that can be\ngot—I don’t say,” he added a trifle grimly. “That will be the proper\ntime. But as, for you, from such a woman, there will always be\nsomething to be got, my remark’s not a wrong to her.” Chad let him go\non, showing every decent deference, showing perhaps also a candid\ncuriosity for this sharper accent. “I remember you, you know, as you\nwere.”\n\n“An awful ass, wasn’t I?”\n\nThe response was as prompt as if he had pressed a spring; it had a\nready abundance at which he even winced; so that he took a moment to\nmeet it. “You certainly then wouldn’t have seemed worth all you’ve let\nme in for. You’ve defined yourself better. Your value has quintupled.”\n\n“Well then, wouldn’t that be enough—?”\n\nChad had risked it jocosely, but Strether remained blank. “Enough?”\n\n“If one _should_ wish to live on one’s accumulations?” After which,\nhowever, as his friend appeared cold to the joke, the young man as\neasily dropped it. “Of course I really never forget, night or day, what\nI owe her. I owe her everything. I give you my word of honour,” he\nfrankly rang out, “that I’m not a bit tired of her.” Strether at this\nonly gave him a stare: the way youth could express itself was again and\nagain a wonder. He meant no harm, though he might after all be capable\nof much; yet he spoke of being “tired” of her almost as he might have\nspoken of being tired of roast mutton for dinner. “She has never for a\nmoment yet bored me—never been wanting, as the cleverest women\nsometimes are, in tact. She has never talked about her tact—as even\nthey too sometimes talk; but she has always had it. She has never had\nit more”—he handsomely made the point—“than just lately.” And he\nscrupulously went further. “She has never been anything I could call a\nburden.”\n\nStrether for a moment said nothing; then he spoke gravely, with his\nshade of dryness deepened. “Oh if you didn’t do her justice—!”\n\n“I _should_ be a beast, eh?”\n\nStrether devoted no time to saying what he would be; _that_, visibly,\nwould take them far. If there was nothing for it but to repeat,\nhowever, repetition was no mistake. “You owe her everything—very much\nmore than she can ever owe you. You’ve in other words duties to her, of\nthe most positive sort; and I don’t see what other duties—as the others\nare presented to you—can be held to go before them.”\n\nChad looked at him with a smile. “And you know of course about the\nothers, eh?—since it’s you yourself who have done the presenting.”\n\n“Much of it—yes—and to the best of my ability. But not all—from the\nmoment your sister took my place.”\n\n“She didn’t,” Chad returned. “Sally took a place, certainly; but it was\nnever, I saw from the first moment, to be yours. No one—with us—will\never take yours. It wouldn’t be possible.”\n\n“Ah of course,” sighed Strether, “I knew it. I believe you’re right. No\none in the world, I imagine, was ever so portentously solemn. There I\nam,” he added with another sigh, as if weary enough, on occasion, of\nthis truth. “I was made so.”\n\nChad appeared for a little to consider the way he was made; he might\nfor this purpose have measured him up and down. His conclusion favoured\nthe fact. “_You_ have never needed any one to make you better. There\nhas never been any one good enough. They couldn’t,” the young man\ndeclared.\n\nHis friend hesitated. “I beg your pardon. They _have_.”\n\nChad showed, not without amusement, his doubt. “Who then?”\n\nStrether—though a little dimly—smiled at him. “Women—too.”\n\n“‘Two’?”—Chad stared and laughed. “Oh I don’t believe, for such work,\nin any more than one! So you’re proving too much. And what _is_\nbeastly, at all events,” he added, “is losing you.”\n\nStrether had set himself in motion for departure, but at this he\npaused. “Are you afraid?”\n\n“Afraid—?”\n\n“Of doing wrong. I mean away from my eye.” Before Chad could speak,\nhowever, he had taken himself up. “I _am_, certainly,” he laughed,\n“prodigious.”\n\n“Yes, you spoil us for all the stupid—!” This might have been, on\nChad’s part, in its extreme emphasis, almost too freely extravagant;\nbut it was full, plainly enough, of the intention of comfort, it\ncarried with it a protest against doubt and a promise, positively, of\nperformance. Picking up a hat in the vestibule he came out with his\nfriend, came downstairs, took his arm, affectionately, as to help and\nguide him, treating him if not exactly as aged and infirm, yet as a\nnoble eccentric who appealed to tenderness, and keeping on with him,\nwhile they walked, to the next corner and the next. “You needn’t tell\nme, you needn’t tell me!”—this again as they proceeded, he wished to\nmake Strether feel. What he needn’t tell him was now at last, in the\ngeniality of separation, anything at all it concerned him to know. He\nknew, up to the hilt—that really came over Chad; he understood, felt,\nrecorded his vow; and they lingered on it as they had lingered in their\nwalk to Strether’s hotel the night of their first meeting. The latter\ntook, at this hour, all he could get; he had given all he had had to\ngive; he was as depleted as if he had spent his last sou. But there was\njust one thing for which, before they broke off, Chad seemed disposed\nslightly to bargain. His companion needn’t, as he said, tell him, but\nhe might himself mention that he had been getting some news of the art\nof advertisement. He came out quite suddenly with this announcement\nwhile Strether wondered if his revived interest were what had taken\nhim, with strange inconsequence, over to London. He appeared at all\nevents to have been looking into the question and had encountered a\nrevelation. Advertising scientifically worked presented itself thus as\nthe great new force. “It really does the thing, you know.”\n\nThey were face to face under the street-lamp as they had been the first\nnight, and Strether, no doubt, looked blank. “Affects, you mean, the\nsale of the object advertised?”\n\n“Yes—but affects it extraordinarily; really beyond what one had\nsupposed. I mean of course when it’s done as one makes out that in our\nroaring age, it _can_ be done. I’ve been finding out a little, though\nit doubtless doesn’t amount to much more than what you originally, so\nawfully vividly—and all, very nearly, that first night—put before me.\nIt’s an art like another, and infinite like all the arts.” He went on\nas if for the joke of it—almost as if his friend’s face amused him. “In\nthe hands, naturally, of a master. The right man must take hold. With\nthe right man to work it _c’est un monde_.”\n\nStrether had watched him quite as if, there on the pavement without a\npretext, he had begun to dance a fancy step. “Is what you’re thinking\nof that you yourself, in the case you have in mind, would be the right\nman?”\n\nChad had thrown back his light coat and thrust each of his thumbs into\nan armhole of his waistcoat; in which position his fingers played up\nand down. “Why, what is he but what you yourself, as I say, took me for\nwhen you first came out?”\n\nStrether felt a little faint, but he coerced his attention. “Oh yes,\nand there’s no doubt that, with your natural parts, you’d have much in\ncommon with him. Advertising is clearly at this time of day the secret\nof trade. It’s quite possible it will be open to you—giving the whole\nof your mind to it—to make the whole place hum with you. Your mother’s\nappeal is to the whole of your mind, and that’s exactly the strength of\nher case.”\n\nChad’s fingers continued to twiddle, but he had something of a drop.\n“Ah we’ve been through my mother’s case!”\n\n“So I thought. Why then do you speak of the matter?”\n\n“Only because it was part of our original discussion. To wind up where\nwe began, my interest’s purely platonic. There at any rate the fact\nis—the fact of the possible. I mean the money in it.”\n\n“Oh damn the money in it!” said Strether. And then as the young man’s\nfixed smile seemed to shine out more strange: “Shall you give your\nfriend up for the money in it?”\n\nChad preserved his handsome grimace as well as the rest of his\nattitude. “You’re not altogether—in your so great ‘solemnity’—kind.\nHaven’t I been drinking you in—showing you all I feel you’re worth to\nme? What have I done, what am I doing, but cleave to her to the death?\nThe only thing is,” he good-humouredly explained, “that one can’t but\nhave it before one, in the cleaving—the point where the death comes in.\nDon’t be afraid for _that_. It’s pleasant to a fellow’s feelings,” he\ndeveloped, “to ‘size-up’ the bribe he applies his foot to.”\n\n“Oh then if all you want’s a kickable surface the bribe’s enormous.”\n\n“Good. Then there it goes!” Chad administered his kick with fantastic\nforce and sent an imaginary object flying. It was accordingly as if\nthey were once more rid of the question and could come back to what\nreally concerned him. “Of course I shall see you tomorrow.”\n\nBut Strether scarce heeded the plan proposed for this; he had still the\nimpression—not the slighter for the simulated kick—of an irrelevant\nhornpipe or jig. “You’re restless.”\n\n“Ah,” returned Chad as they parted, “you’re exciting.”\n\n\n V\n\nHe had, however, within two days, another separation to face. He had\nsent Maria Gostrey a word early, by hand, to ask if he might come to\nbreakfast; in consequence of which, at noon, she awaited him in the\ncool shade of her little Dutch-looking dining-room. This retreat was at\nthe back of the house, with a view of a scrap of old garden that had\nbeen saved from modern ravage; and though he had on more than one other\noccasion had his legs under its small and peculiarly polished table of\nhospitality, the place had never before struck him as so sacred to\npleasant knowledge, to intimate charm, to antique order, to a neatness\nthat was almost august. To sit there was, as he had told his hostess\nbefore, to see life reflected for the time in ideally kept pewter;\nwhich was somehow becoming, improving to life, so that one’s eyes were\nheld and comforted. Strether’s were comforted at all events now—and the\nmore that it was the last time—with the charming effect, on the board\nbare of a cloth and proud of its perfect surface, of the small old\ncrockery and old silver, matched by the more substantial pieces happily\ndisposed about the room. The specimens of vivid Delf, in particular had\nthe dignity of family portraits; and it was in the midst of them that\nour friend resignedly expressed himself. He spoke even with a certain\nphilosophic humour. “There’s nothing more to wait for; I seem to have\ndone a good day’s work. I’ve let them have it all round. I’ve seen\nChad, who has been to London and come back. He tells me I’m ‘exciting,’\nand I seem indeed pretty well to have upset every one. I’ve at any rate\nexcited _him_. He’s distinctly restless.”\n\n“You’ve excited _me_,” Miss Gostrey smiled. “_I’m_ distinctly\nrestless.”\n\n“Oh you were that when I found you. It seems to me I’ve rather got you\nout of it. What’s this,” he asked as he looked about him, “but a haunt\nof ancient peace?”\n\n“I wish with all my heart,” she presently replied, “I could make you\ntreat it as a haven of rest.” On which they fronted each other, across\nthe table, as if things unuttered were in the air.\n\nStrether seemed, in his way, when he next spoke, to take some of them\nup. “It wouldn’t give me—that would be the trouble—what it will, no\ndoubt, still give you. I’m not,” he explained, leaning back in his\nchair, but with his eyes on a small ripe round melon—“in real harmony\nwith what surrounds me. You _are_. I take it too hard. You _don’t_. It\nmakes—that’s what it comes to in the end—a fool of me.” Then at a\ntangent, “What has he been doing in London?” he demanded.\n\n“Ah one may go to London,” Maria laughed. “You know _I_ did.”\n\nYes—he took the reminder. “And you brought _me_ back.” He brooded there\nopposite to her, but without gloom. “Whom has Chad brought? He’s full\nof ideas. And I wrote to Sarah,” he added, “the first thing this\nmorning. So I’m square. I’m ready for them.”\n\nShe neglected certain parts of this speech in the interest of others.\n“Marie said to me the other day that she felt him to have the makings\nof an immense man of business.”\n\n“There it is. He’s the son of his father!”\n\n“But _such_ a father!”\n\n“Ah just the right one from that point of view! But it isn’t his father\nin him,” Strether added, “that troubles me.”\n\n“What is it then?” He came back to his breakfast; he partook presently\nof the charming melon, which she liberally cut for him; and it was only\nafter this that he met her question. Then moreover it was but to remark\nthat he’d answer her presently. She waited, she watched, she served him\nand amused him, and it was perhaps with this last idea that she soon\nreminded him of his having never even yet named to her the article\nproduced at Woollett. “Do you remember our talking of it in London—that\nnight at the play?” Before he could say yes, however, she had put it to\nhim for other matters. Did he remember, did he remember—this and that\nof their first days? He remembered everything, bringing up with humour\neven things of which she professed no recollection, things she\nvehemently denied; and falling back above all on the great interest of\ntheir early time, the curiosity felt by both of them as to where he\nwould “come out.” They had so assumed it was to be in some wonderful\nplace—they had thought of it as so very _much_ out. Well, that was\ndoubtless what it had been—since he had come out just there. He was\nout, in truth, as far as it was possible to be, and must now rather\nbethink himself of getting in again. He found on the spot the image of\nhis recent history; he was like one of the figures of the old clock at\nBerne. _They_ came out, on one side, at their hour, jigged along their\nlittle course in the public eye, and went in on the other side. He too\nhad jigged his little course—him too a modest retreat awaited. He\noffered now, should she really like to know, to name the great product\nof Woollett. It would be a great commentary on everything. At this she\nstopped him off; she not only had no wish to know, but she wouldn’t\nknow for the world. She had done with the products of Woollett—for all\nthe good she had got from them. She desired no further news of them,\nand she mentioned that Madame de Vionnet herself had, to her knowledge,\nlived exempt from the information he was ready to supply. She had never\nconsented to receive it, though she would have taken it, under stress,\nfrom Mrs. Pocock. But it was a matter about which Mrs. Pocock appeared\nto have had little to say—never sounding the word—and it didn’t signify\nnow. There was nothing clearly for Maria Gostrey that signified\nnow—save one sharp point, that is, to which she came in time. “I don’t\nknow whether it’s before you as a possibility that, left to himself,\nMr. Chad may after all go back. I judge that it _is_ more or less so\nbefore you, from what you just now said of him.”\n\nHer guest had his eyes on her, kindly but attentively, as if foreseeing\nwhat was to follow this. “I don’t think it will be for the money.” And\nthen as she seemed uncertain: “I mean I don’t believe it will be for\nthat he’ll give her up.”\n\n“Then he _will_ give her up?”\n\nStrether waited a moment, rather slow and deliberate now, drawing out a\nlittle this last soft stage, pleading with her in various suggestive\nand unspoken ways for patience and understanding. “What were you just\nabout to ask me?”\n\n“Is there anything he can do that would make you patch it up?”\n\n“With Mrs. Newsome?”\n\nHer assent, as if she had had a delicacy about sounding the name, was\nonly in her face; but she added with it: “Or is there anything he can\ndo that would make _her_ try it?”\n\n“To patch it up with me?” His answer came at last in a conclusive\nheadshake. “There’s nothing any one can do. It’s over. Over for both of\nus.”\n\nMaria wondered, seemed a little to doubt. “Are you so sure for her?”\n\n“Oh yes—sure now. Too much has happened. I’m different for her.”\n\nShe took it in then, drawing a deeper breath. “I see. So that as she’s\ndifferent for _you_—”\n\n“Ah but,” he interrupted, “she’s not.” And as Miss Gostrey wondered\nagain: “She’s the same. She’s more than ever the same. But I do what I\ndidn’t before—I _see_ her.”\n\nHe spoke gravely and as if responsibly—since he had to pronounce; and\nthe effect of it was slightly solemn, so that she simply exclaimed\n“Oh!” Satisfied and grateful, however, she showed in her own next words\nan acceptance of his statement. “What then do you go home to?”\n\nHe had pushed his plate a little away, occupied with another side of\nthe matter; taking refuge verily in that side and feeling so moved that\nhe soon found himself on his feet. He was affected in advance by what\nhe believed might come from her, and he would have liked to forestall\nit and deal with it tenderly; yet in the presence of it he wished still\nmore to be—though as smoothly as possible—deterrent and conclusive. He\nput her question by for the moment; he told her more about Chad. “It\nwould have been impossible to meet me more than he did last night on\nthe question of the infamy of not sticking to her.”\n\n“Is that what you called it for him—‘infamy’?”\n\n“Oh rather! I described to him in detail the base creature he’d be, and\nhe quite agrees with me about it.”\n\n“So that it’s really as if you had nailed him?”\n\n“Quite really as if—! I told him I should curse him.”\n\n“Oh,” she smiled, “you _have_ done it.” And then having thought again:\n“You _can’t_ after that propose—!” Yet she scanned his face.\n\n“Propose again to Mrs. Newsome?”\n\nShe hesitated afresh, but she brought it out. “I’ve never believed, you\nknow, that you did propose. I always believed it was really she—and, so\nfar as that goes, I can understand it. What I mean is,” she explained,\n“that with such a spirit—the spirit of curses!—your breach is past\nmending. She has only to know what you’ve done to him never again to\nraise a finger.”\n\n“I’ve done,” said Strether, “what I could—one can’t do more. He\nprotests his devotion and his horror. But I’m not sure I’ve saved him.\nHe protests too much. He asks how one can dream of his being tired. But\nhe has all life before him.”\n\nMaria saw what he meant. “He’s formed to please.”\n\n“And it’s our friend who has formed him.” Strether felt in it the\nstrange irony.\n\n“So it’s scarcely his fault!”\n\n“It’s at any rate his danger. I mean,” said Strether, “it’s hers. But\nshe knows it.”\n\n“Yes, she knows it. And is your idea,” Miss Gostrey asked, “that there\nwas some other woman in London?”\n\n“Yes. No. That is I _have_ no ideas. I’m afraid of them. I’ve done with\nthem.” And he put out his hand to her. “Good-bye.”\n\nIt brought her back to her unanswered question. “To what do you go\nhome?”\n\n“I don’t know. There will always be something.”\n\n“To a great difference,” she said as she kept his hand.\n\n“A great difference—no doubt. Yet I shall see what I can make of it.”\n\n“Shall you make anything so good—?” But, as if remembering what Mrs.\nNewsome had done, it was as far as she went.\n\nHe had sufficiently understood. “So good as this place at this moment?\nSo good as what _you_ make of everything you touch?” He took a moment\nto say, for, really and truly, what stood about him there in her\noffer—which was as the offer of exquisite service, of lightened care,\nfor the rest of his days—might well have tempted. It built him softly\nround, it roofed him warmly over, it rested, all so firm, on selection.\nAnd what ruled selection was beauty and knowledge. It was awkward, it\nwas almost stupid, not to seem to prize such things; yet, none the\nless, so far as they made his opportunity they made it only for a\nmoment. She’d moreover understand—she always understood.\n\nThat indeed might be, but meanwhile she was going on. “There’s nothing,\nyou know, I wouldn’t do for you.”\n\n“Oh yes—I know.”\n\n“There’s nothing,” she repeated, “in all the world.”\n\n“I know. I know. But all the same I must go.” He had got it at last.\n“To be right.”\n\n“To be right?”\n\nShe had echoed it in vague deprecation, but he felt it already clear\nfor her. “That, you see, is my only logic. Not, out of the whole\naffair, to have got anything for myself.”\n\nShe thought. “But with your wonderful impressions you’ll have got a\ngreat deal.”\n\n“A great deal”—he agreed. “But nothing like _you_. It’s you who would\nmake me wrong!”\n\nHonest and fine, she couldn’t greatly pretend she didn’t see it. Still\nshe could pretend just a little. “But why should you be so dreadfully\nright?”\n\n“That’s the way that—if I must go—you yourself would be the first to\nwant me. And I can’t do anything else.”\n\nSo then she had to take it, though still with her defeated protest. “It\nisn’t so much your _being_ ‘right’—it’s your horrible sharp eye for\nwhat makes you so.”\n\n“Oh but you’re just as bad yourself. You can’t resist me when I point\nthat out.”\n\nShe sighed it at last all comically, all tragically, away. “I can’t\nindeed resist you.”\n\n“Then there we are!” said Strether.",
