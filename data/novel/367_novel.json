 "text": "THE COUNTRY OF THE POINTED FIRS\n\nBy Sarah Orne Jewett\n\n\nNote:\n\nSARAH ORNE JEWETT (1849-1909) was born and died in South Berwick, Maine.\nHer father was the region's most distinguished doctor and, as a child,\nJewett often accompanied him on his round of patient visits. She began\nwriting poetry at an early age and when she was only 19 her short story\n“Mr. Bruce” was accepted by the Atlantic Monthly. Her association with\nthat magazine continued, and William Dean Howells, who was editor at\nthat time, encouraged her to publish her first book, Deephaven (1877),\na collection of sketches published earlier in the Atlantic Monthly.\nThrough her friendship with Howells, Jewett became acquainted with\nBoston's literary elite, including Annie Fields, with whom she developed\none of the most intimate and lasting relationships of her life.\n\nThe Country of the Pointed Firs (1896) is considered Jewett's finest\nwork, described by Henry James as her “beautiful little quantum of\nachievement.” Despite James's diminutives, the novel remains a classic.\nBecause it is loosely structured, many critics view the book not as\na novel, but a series of sketches; however, its structure is unified\nthrough both setting and theme. Jewett herself felt that her strengths\nas a writer lay not in plot development or dramatic tension, but in\ncharacter development. Indeed, she determined early in her career to\npreserve a disappearing way of life, and her novel can be read as a\nstudy of the effects of isolation and hardship on the inhabitants who\nlived in the decaying fishing villages along the Maine coast.\n\nJewett died in 1909, eight years after an accident that effectively\nended her writing career. Her reputation had grown during her lifetime,\nextending far beyond the bounds of the New England she loved.\n\n\n\nContents\n\n              I  The Return\n             II  Mrs. Todd\n            III  The Schoolhouse\n             IV  At the Schoolhouse Window\n              V  Captain Littlepage\n             VI  The Waiting Place\n            VII  The Outer Island\n           VIII  Green Island\n             IX  William\n              X  Where Pennyroyal Grew\n             XI  The Old Singers\n            XII  A Strange Sail\n           XIII  Poor Joanna\n            XIV  The Hermitage\n             XV  On Shell-heap Island\n            XVI  The Great Expedition\n           XVII  A Country Road\n          XVIII  The Bowden Reunion\n            XIX  The Feast's End\n             XX  Along Shore\n            XXI  The Backward View\n\n\n\n\n\nI. The Return\n\nTHERE WAS SOMETHING about the coast town of Dunnet which made it seem\nmore attractive than other maritime villages of eastern Maine. Perhaps\nit was the simple fact of acquaintance with that neighborhood which\nmade it so attaching, and gave such interest to the rocky shore and\ndark woods, and the few houses which seemed to be securely wedged and\ntree-nailed in among the ledges by the Landing. These houses made\nthe most of their seaward view, and there was a gayety and determined\nfloweriness in their bits of garden ground; the small-paned high windows\nin the peaks of their steep gables were like knowing eyes that watched\nthe harbor and the far sea-line beyond, or looked northward all along\nthe shore and its background of spruces and balsam firs. When one really\nknows a village like this and its surroundings, it is like becoming\nacquainted with a single person. The process of falling in love at first\nsight is as final as it is swift in such a case, but the growth of true\nfriendship may be a lifelong affair.\n\nAfter a first brief visit made two or three summers before in the course\nof a yachting cruise, a lover of Dunnet Landing returned to find the\nunchanged shores of the pointed firs, the same quaintness of the village\nwith its elaborate conventionalities; all that mixture of remoteness,\nand childish certainty of being the centre of civilization of which her\naffectionate dreams had told. One evening in June, a single passenger\nlanded upon the steamboat wharf. The tide was high, there was a fine\ncrowd of spectators, and the younger portion of the company followed\nher with subdued excitement up the narrow street of the salt-aired,\nwhite-clapboarded little town.\n\n\n\n\nII. Mrs. Todd\n\nLATER, THERE WAS only one fault to find with this choice of a summer\nlodging-place, and that was its complete lack of seclusion. At first the\ntiny house of Mrs. Almira Todd, which stood with its end to the street,\nappeared to be retired and sheltered enough from the busy world, behind\nits bushy bit of a green garden, in which all the blooming things, two\nor three gay hollyhocks and some London-pride, were pushed back against\nthe gray-shingled wall. It was a queer little garden and puzzling to\na stranger, the few flowers being put at a disadvantage by so much\ngreenery; but the discovery was soon made that Mrs. Todd was an ardent\nlover of herbs, both wild and tame, and the sea-breezes blew into\nthe low end-window of the house laden with not only sweet-brier\nand sweet-mary, but balm and sage and borage and mint, wormwood and\nsouthernwood. If Mrs. Todd had occasion to step into the far corner\nof her herb plot, she trod heavily upon thyme, and made its fragrant\npresence known with all the rest. Being a very large person, her full\nskirts brushed and bent almost every slender stalk that her feet missed.\nYou could always tell when she was stepping about there, even when you\nwere half awake in the morning, and learned to know, in the course of a\nfew weeks' experience, in exactly which corner of the garden she might\nbe.\n\nAt one side of this herb plot were other growths of a rustic\npharmacopoeia, great treasures and rarities among the commoner herbs.\nThere were some strange and pungent odors that roused a dim sense and\nremembrance of something in the forgotten past. Some of these might\nonce have belonged to sacred and mystic rites, and have had some occult\nknowledge handed with them down the centuries; but now they pertained\nonly to humble compounds brewed at intervals with molasses or vinegar\nor spirits in a small caldron on Mrs. Todd's kitchen stove. They were\ndispensed to suffering neighbors, who usually came at night as if by\nstealth, bringing their own ancient-looking vials to be filled. One\nnostrum was called the Indian remedy, and its price was but fifteen\ncents; the whispered directions could be heard as customers passed\nthe windows. With most remedies the purchaser was allowed to depart\nunadmonished from the kitchen, Mrs. Todd being a wise saver of steps;\nbut with certain vials she gave cautions, standing in the doorway, and\nthere were other doses which had to be accompanied on their healing way\nas far as the gate, while she muttered long chapters of directions, and\nkept up an air of secrecy and importance to the last. It may not have\nbeen only the common aids of humanity with which she tried to cope; it\nseemed sometimes as if love and hate and jealousy and adverse winds at\nsea might also find their proper remedies among the curious wild-looking\nplants in Mrs. Todd's garden.\n\nThe village doctor and this learned herbalist were upon the best of\nterms. The good man may have counted upon the unfavorable effect of\ncertain potions which he should find his opportunity in counteracting;\nat any rate, he now and then stopped and exchanged greetings with Mrs.\nTodd over the picket fence. The conversation became at once professional\nafter the briefest preliminaries, and he would stand twirling a\nsweet-scented sprig in his fingers, and make suggestive jokes, perhaps\nabout her faith in a too persistent course of thoroughwort elixir, in\nwhich my landlady professed such firm belief as sometimes to endanger\nthe life and usefulness of worthy neighbors.\n\nTo arrive at this quietest of seaside villages late in June, when the\nbusy herb-gathering season was just beginning, was also to arrive in\nthe early prime of Mrs. Todd's activity in the brewing of old-fashioned\nspruce beer. This cooling and refreshing drink had been brought to\nwonderful perfection through a long series of experiments; it had won\nimmense local fame, and the supplies for its manufacture were always\ngiving out and having to be replenished. For various reasons, the\nseclusion and uninterrupted days which had been looked forward to proved\nto be very rare in this otherwise delightful corner of the world. My\nhostess and I had made our shrewd business agreement on the basis of a\nsimple cold luncheon at noon, and liberal restitution in the matter of\nhot suppers, to provide for which the lodger might sometimes be seen\nhurrying down the road, late in the day, with cunner line in hand.\nIt was soon found that this arrangement made large allowance for Mrs.\nTodd's slow herb-gathering progresses through woods and pastures. The\nspruce-beer customers were pretty steady in hot weather, and there were\nmany demands for different soothing syrups and elixirs with which the\nunwise curiosity of my early residence had made me acquainted. Knowing\nMrs. Todd to be a widow, who had little beside this slender business and\nthe income from one hungry lodger to maintain her, one's energies and\neven interest were quickly bestowed, until it became a matter of course\nthat she should go afield every pleasant day, and that the lodger should\nanswer all peremptory knocks at the side door.\n\nIn taking an occasional wisdom-giving stroll in Mrs. Todd's company, and\nin acting as business partner during her frequent absences, I found the\nJuly days fly fast, and it was not until I felt myself confronted with\ntoo great pride and pleasure in the display, one night, of two dollars\nand twenty-seven cents which I had taken in during the day, that I\nremembered a long piece of writing, sadly belated now, which I was bound\nto do. To have been patted kindly on the shoulder and called “darlin',”\n to have been offered a surprise of early mushrooms for supper, to have\nhad all the glory of making two dollars and twenty-seven cents in a\nsingle day, and then to renounce it all and withdraw from these pleasant\nsuccesses, needed much resolution. Literary employments are so vexed\nwith uncertainties at best, and it was not until the voice of conscience\nsounded louder in my ears than the sea on the nearest pebble beach that\nI said unkind words of withdrawal to Mrs. Todd. She only became more\nwistfully affectionate than ever in her expressions, and looked as\ndisappointed as I expected when I frankly told her that I could no\nlonger enjoy the pleasure of what we called “seein' folks.” I felt that\nI was cruel to a whole neighborhood in curtailing her liberty in this\nmost important season for harvesting the different wild herbs that were\nso much counted upon to ease their winter ails.\n\n“Well, dear,” she said sorrowfully, “I've took great advantage o' your\nbein' here. I ain't had such a season for years, but I have never had\nnobody I could so trust. All you lack is a few qualities, but with time\nyou'd gain judgment an' experience, an' be very able in the business.\nI'd stand right here an' say it to anybody.”\n\n\nMrs. Todd and I were not separated or estranged by the change in our\nbusiness relations; on the contrary, a deeper intimacy seemed to begin.\nI do not know what herb of the night it was that used sometimes to send\nout a penetrating odor late in the evening, after the dew had fallen,\nand the moon was high, and the cool air came up from the sea. Then Mrs.\nTodd would feel that she must talk to somebody, and I was only too glad\nto listen. We both fell under the spell, and she either stood outside\nthe window, or made an errand to my sitting-room, and told, it might\nbe very commonplace news of the day, or, as happened one misty summer\nnight, all that lay deepest in her heart. It was in this way that I came\nto know that she had loved one who was far above her.\n\n“No, dear, him I speak of could never think of me,” she said. “When\nwe was young together his mother didn't favor the match, an' done\neverything she could to part us; and folks thought we both married well,\nbut't wa'n't what either one of us wanted most; an' now we're left alone\nagain, an' might have had each other all the time. He was above bein' a\nseafarin' man, an' prospered more than most; he come of a high family,\nan' my lot was plain an' hard-workin'. I ain't seen him for some years;\nhe's forgot our youthful feelin's, I expect, but a woman's heart is\ndifferent; them feelin's comes back when you think you've done with\n'em, as sure as spring comes with the year. An' I've always had ways of\nhearin' about him.”\n\nShe stood in the centre of a braided rug, and its rings of black and\ngray seemed to circle about her feet in the dim light. Her height and\nmassiveness in the low room gave her the look of a huge sibyl, while the\nstrange fragrance of the mysterious herb blew in from the little garden.\n\n\n\n\nIII. The Schoolhouse\n\nFOR SOME DAYS after this, Mrs. Todd's customers came and went past my\nwindows, and, haying-time being nearly over, strangers began to arrive\nfrom the inland country, such was her widespread reputation. Sometimes\nI saw a pale young creature like a white windflower left over into\nmidsummer, upon whose face consumption had set its bright and wistful\nmark; but oftener two stout, hard-worked women from the farms came\ntogether, and detailed their symptoms to Mrs. Todd in loud and cheerful\nvoices, combining the satisfactions of a friendly gossip with the\nmedical opportunity. They seemed to give much from their own store of\ntherapeutic learning. I became aware of the school in which my landlady\nhad strengthened her natural gift; but hers was always the governing\nmind, and the final command, “Take of hy'sop one handful” (or whatever\nherb it was), was received in respectful silence. One afternoon, when\nI had listened,--it was impossible not to listen, with cottonless\nears,--and then laughed and listened again, with an idle pen in my hand,\nduring a particularly spirited and personal conversation, I reached for\nmy hat, and, taking blotting-book and all under my arm, I resolutely\nfled further temptation, and walked out past the fragrant green garden\nand up the dusty road. The way went straight uphill, and presently I\nstopped and turned to look back.\n\nThe tide was in, the wide harbor was surrounded by its dark woods, and\nthe small wooden houses stood as near as they could get to the landing.\nMrs. Todd's was the last house on the way inland. The gray ledges of the\nrocky shore were well covered with sod in most places, and the pasture\nbayberry and wild roses grew thick among them. I could see the higher\ninland country and the scattered farms. On the brink of the hill stood a\nlittle white schoolhouse, much wind-blown and weather-beaten, which was\na landmark to seagoing folk; from its door there was a most beautiful\nview of sea and shore. The summer vacation now prevailed, and after\nfinding the door unfastened, and taking a long look through one of the\nseaward windows, and reflecting afterward for some time in a shady place\nnear by among the bayberry bushes, I returned to the chief place of\nbusiness in the village, and, to the amusement of two of the selectmen,\nbrothers and autocrats of Dunnet Landing, I hired the schoolhouse for\nthe rest of the vacation for fifty cents a week.\n\nSelfish as it may appear, the retired situation seemed to possess great\nadvantages, and I spent many days there quite undisturbed, with the\nsea-breeze blowing through the small, high windows and swaying the heavy\noutside shutters to and fro. I hung my hat and luncheon-basket on an\nentry nail as if I were a small scholar, but I sat at the teacher's desk\nas if I were that great authority, with all the timid empty benches in\nrows before me. Now and then an idle sheep came and stood for a long\ntime looking in at the door. At sundown I went back, feeling most\nbusinesslike, down toward the village again, and usually met the flavor,\nnot of the herb garden, but of Mrs. Todd's hot supper, halfway up the\nhill. On the nights when there were evening meetings or other public\nexercises that demanded her presence we had tea very early, and I was\nwelcomed back as if from a long absence.\n\nOnce or twice I feigned excuses for staying at home, while Mrs. Todd\nmade distant excursions, and came home late, with both hands full and\na heavily laden apron. This was in pennyroyal time, and when the rare\nlobelia was in its prime and the elecampane was coming on. One day she\nappeared at the schoolhouse itself, partly out of amused curiosity\nabout my industries; but she explained that there was no tansy in\nthe neighborhood with such snap to it as some that grew about the\nschoolhouse lot. Being scuffed down all the spring made it grow so much\nthe better, like some folks that had it hard in their youth, and were\nbound to make the most of themselves before they died.\n\n\n\n\nIV. At the Schoolhouse Window\n\nONE DAY I reached the schoolhouse very late, owing to attendance upon\nthe funeral of an acquaintance and neighbor, with whose sad decline in\nhealth I had been familiar, and whose last days both the doctor and\nMrs. Todd had tried in vain to ease. The services had taken place at\none o'clock, and now, at quarter past two, I stood at the schoolhouse\nwindow, looking down at the procession as it went along the lower road\nclose to the shore. It was a walking funeral, and even at that distance\nI could recognize most of the mourners as they went their solemn way.\nMrs. Begg had been very much respected, and there was a large company\nof friends following to her grave. She had been brought up on one of\nthe neighboring farms, and each of the few times that I had seen her\nshe professed great dissatisfaction with town life. The people lived\ntoo close together for her liking, at the Landing, and she could not\nget used to the constant sound of the sea. She had lived to lament\nthree seafaring husbands, and her house was decorated with West Indian\ncuriosities, specimens of conch shells and fine coral which they had\nbrought home from their voyages in lumber-laden ships. Mrs. Todd had\ntold me all our neighbor's history. They had been girls together, and,\nto use her own phrase, had “both seen trouble till they knew the best\nand worst on 't.” I could see the sorrowful, large figure of Mrs. Todd\nas I stood at the window. She made a break in the procession by walking\nslowly and keeping the after-part of it back. She held a handkerchief\nto her eyes, and I knew, with a pang of sympathy, that hers was not\naffected grief.\n\nBeside her, after much difficulty, I recognized the one strange and\nunrelated person in all the company, an old man who had always been\nmysterious to me. I could see his thin, bending figure. He wore a\nnarrow, long-tailed coat and walked with a stick, and had the same “cant\nto leeward” as the wind-bent trees on the height above.\n\nThis was Captain Littlepage, whom I had seen only once or twice before,\nsitting pale and old behind a closed window; never out of doors until\nnow. Mrs. Todd always shook her head gravely when I asked a question,\nand said that he wasn't what he had been once, and seemed to class him\nwith her other secrets. He might have belonged with a simple which grew\nin a certain slug-haunted corner of the garden, whose use she could\nnever be betrayed into telling me, though I saw her cutting the tops\nby moonlight once, as if it were a charm, and not a medicine, like the\ngreat fading bloodroot leaves.\n\nI could see that she was trying to keep pace with the old captain's\nlighter steps. He looked like an aged grasshopper of some strange human\nvariety. Behind this pair was a short, impatient, little person, who\nkept the captain's house, and gave it what Mrs. Todd and others believed\nto be no proper sort of care. She was usually called “that Mari' Harris”\n in subdued conversation between intimates, but they treated her with\nanxious civility when they met her face to face.\n\nThe bay-sheltered islands and the great sea beyond stretched away to\nthe far horizon southward and eastward; the little procession in the\nforeground looked futile and helpless on the edge of the rocky shore. It\nwas a glorious day early in July, with a clear, high sky; there were no\nclouds, there was no noise of the sea. The song sparrows sang and sang,\nas if with joyous knowledge of immortality, and contempt for those who\ncould so pettily concern themselves with death. I stood watching until\nthe funeral procession had crept round a shoulder of the slope below and\ndisappeared from the great landscape as if it had gone into a cave.\n\nAn hour later I was busy at my work. Now and then a bee blundered in and\ntook me for an enemy; but there was a useful stick upon the teacher's\ndesk, and I rapped to call the bees to order as if they were unruly\nscholars, or waved them away from their riots over the ink, which I had\nbought at the Landing store, and discovered to be scented with bergamot,\nas if to refresh the labors of anxious scribes. One anxious scribe\nfelt very dull that day; a sheep-bell tinkled near by, and called her\nwandering wits after it. The sentences failed to catch these lovely\nsummer cadences. For the first time I began to wish for a companion\nand for news from the outer world, which had been, half unconsciously,\nforgotten. Watching the funeral gave one a sort of pain. I began to\nwonder if I ought not to have walked with the rest, instead of hurrying\naway at the end of the services. Perhaps the Sunday gown I had put on\nfor the occasion was making this disastrous change of feeling, but I had\nnow made myself and my friends remember that I did not really belong to\nDunnet Landing.\n\nI sighed, and turned to the half-written page again.\n\n\n\n\nV. Captain Littlepage\n\nIT WAS A long time after this; an hour was very long in that coast\ntown where nothing stole away the shortest minute. I had lost myself\ncompletely in work, when I heard footsteps outside. There was a steep\nfootpath between the upper and the lower road, which I climbed to\nshorten the way, as the children had taught me, but I believed that Mrs.\nTodd would find it inaccessible, unless she had occasion to seek me in\ngreat haste. I wrote on, feeling like a besieged miser of time, while\nthe footsteps came nearer, and the sheep-bell tinkled away in haste as\nif someone had shaken a stick in its wearer's face. Then I looked, and\nsaw Captain Littlepage passing the nearest window; the next moment he\ntapped politely at the door.\n\n“Come in, sir,” I said, rising to meet him; and he entered, bowing with\nmuch courtesy. I stepped down from the desk and offered him a chair by\nthe window, where he seated himself at once, being sadly spent by his\nclimb. I returned to my fixed seat behind the teacher's desk, which gave\nhim the lower place of a scholar.\n\n“You ought to have the place of honor, Captain Littlepage,” I said.\n\n\n“A happy, rural seat of various views,”\n\nhe quoted, as he gazed out into the sunshine and up the long wooded\nshore. Then he glanced at me, and looked all about him as pleased as a\nchild.\n\n“My quotation was from Paradise Lost: the greatest of poems, I suppose\nyou know?” and I nodded. “There's nothing that ranks, to my mind, with\nParadise Lost; it's all lofty, all lofty,” he continued. “Shakespeare\nwas a great poet; he copied life, but you have to put up with a great\ndeal of low talk.”\n\nI now remembered that Mrs. Todd had told me one day that Captain\nLittlepage had overset his mind with too much reading; she had also made\ndark reference to his having “spells” of some unexplainable nature. I\ncould not help wondering what errand had brought him out in search of\nme. There was something quite charming in his appearance: it was a face\nthin and delicate with refinement, but worn into appealing lines, as if\nhe had suffered from loneliness and misapprehension. He looked, with his\ncareful precision of dress, as if he were the object of cherishing care\non the part of elderly unmarried sisters, but I knew Mari' Harris to be\na very common-place, inelegant person, who would have no such standards;\nit was plain that the captain was his own attentive valet. He sat\nlooking at me expectantly. I could not help thinking that, with his\nqueer head and length of thinness, he was made to hop along the road of\nlife rather than to walk. The captain was very grave indeed, and I bade\nmy inward spirit keep close to discretion.\n\n“Poor Mrs. Begg has gone,” I ventured to say. I still wore my Sunday\ngown by way of showing respect.\n\n“She has gone,” said the captain,--“very easy at the last, I was\ninformed; she slipped away as if she were glad of the opportunity.”\n\nI thought of the Countess of Carberry, and felt that history repeated\nitself.\n\n“She was one of the old stock,” continued Captain Littlepage, with\ntouching sincerity. “She was very much looked up to in this town, and\nwill be missed.”\n\nI wondered, as I looked at him, if he had sprung from a line of\nministers; he had the refinement of look and air of command which are\nthe heritage of the old ecclesiastical families of New England. But\nas Darwin says in his autobiography, “there is no such king as a\nsea-captain; he is greater even than a king or a schoolmaster!”\n\nCaptain Littlepage moved his chair out of the wake of the sunshine,\nand still sat looking at me. I began to be very eager to know upon what\nerrand he had come.\n\n“It may be found out some o' these days,” he said earnestly. “We may\nknow it all, the next step; where Mrs. Begg is now, for instance.\nCertainty, not conjecture, is what we all desire.”\n\n“I suppose we shall know it all some day,” said I.\n\n“We shall know it while yet below,” insisted the captain, with a flush\nof impatience on his thin cheeks. “We have not looked for truth in the\nright direction. I know what I speak of; those who have laughed at me\nlittle know how much reason my ideas are based upon.” He waved his hand\ntoward the village below. “In that handful of houses they fancy that\nthey comprehend the universe.”\n\nI smiled, and waited for him to go on.\n\n“I am an old man, as you can see,” he continued, “and I have been a\nshipmaster the greater part of my life,--forty-three years in all. You\nmay not think it, but I am above eighty years of age.”\n\nHe did not look so old, and I hastened to say so.\n\n“You must have left the sea a good many years ago, then, Captain\nLittlepage?” I said.\n\n“I should have been serviceable at least five or six years more,” he\nanswered. “My acquaintance with certain--my experience upon a certain\noccasion, I might say, gave rise to prejudice. I do not mind telling you\nthat I chanced to learn of one of the greatest discoveries that man has\never made.”\n\nNow we were approaching dangerous ground, but a sudden sense of his\nsufferings at the hands of the ignorant came to my help, and I asked to\nhear more with all the deference I really felt. A swallow flew into\nthe schoolhouse at this moment as if a kingbird were after it, and beat\nitself against the walls for a minute, and escaped again to the open\nair; but Captain Littlepage took no notice whatever of the flurry.\n\n“I had a valuable cargo of general merchandise from the London docks to\nFort Churchill, a station of the old company on Hudson's Bay,” said the\ncaptain earnestly. “We were delayed in lading, and baffled by head winds\nand a heavy tumbling sea all the way north-about and across. Then the\nfog kept us off the coast; and when I made port at last, it was too late\nto delay in those northern waters with such a vessel and such a crew as\nI had. They cared for nothing, and idled me into a fit of sickness;\nbut my first mate was a good, excellent man, with no more idea of being\nfrozen in there until spring than I had, so we made what speed we could\nto get clear of Hudson's Bay and off the coast. I owned an eighth of\nthe vessel, and he owned a sixteenth of her. She was a full-rigged ship,\ncalled the Minerva, but she was getting old and leaky. I meant it should\nbe my last v'y'ge in her, and so it proved. She had been an excellent\nvessel in her day. Of the cowards aboard her I can't say so much.”\n\n“Then you were wrecked?” I asked, as he made a long pause.\n\n“I wa'n't caught astern o' the lighter by any fault of mine,” said the\ncaptain gloomily. “We left Fort Churchill and run out into the Bay with\na light pair o' heels; but I had been vexed to death with their red-tape\nrigging at the company's office, and chilled with stayin' on deck an'\ntryin' to hurry up things, and when we were well out o' sight o' land,\nheadin' for Hudson's Straits, I had a bad turn o' some sort o' fever,\nand had to stay below. The days were getting short, and we made good\nruns, all well on board but me, and the crew done their work by dint of\nhard driving.”\n\nI began to find this unexpected narrative a little dull. Captain\nLittlepage spoke with a kind of slow correctness that lacked the\nlongshore high flavor to which I had grown used; but I listened\nrespectfully while he explained the winds having become contrary, and\ntalked on in a dreary sort of way about his voyage, the bad weather,\nand the disadvantages he was under in the lightness of his ship, which\nbounced about like a chip in a bucket, and would not answer the rudder\nor properly respond to the most careful setting of sails.\n\n“So there we were blowin' along anyways,” he complained; but looking at\nme at this moment, and seeing that my thoughts were unkindly wandering,\nhe ceased to speak.\n\n“It was a hard life at sea in those days, I am sure,” said I, with\nredoubled interest.\n\n“It was a dog's life,” said the poor old gentleman, quite reassured,\n“but it made men of those who followed it. I see a change for the worse\neven in our own town here; full of loafers now, small and poor as 'tis,\nwho once would have followed the sea, every lazy soul of 'em. There is\nno occupation so fit for just that class o' men who never get beyond\nthe fo'cas'le. I view it, in addition, that a community narrows down and\ngrows dreadful ignorant when it is shut up to its own affairs, and gets\nno knowledge of the outside world except from a cheap, unprincipled\nnewspaper. In the old days, a good part o' the best men here knew a\nhundred ports and something of the way folks lived in them. They saw\nthe world for themselves, and like's not their wives and children saw it\nwith them. They may not have had the best of knowledge to carry with 'em\nsight-seein', but they were some acquainted with foreign lands an' their\nlaws, an' could see outside the battle for town clerk here in Dunnet;\nthey got some sense o' proportion. Yes, they lived more dignified, and\ntheir houses were better within an' without. Shipping's a terrible loss\nto this part o' New England from a social point o' view, ma'am.”\n\n“I have thought of that myself,” I returned, with my interest quite\nawakened. “It accounts for the change in a great many things,--the sad\ndisappearance of sea-captains,--doesn't it?”\n\n“A shipmaster was apt to get the habit of reading,” said my companion,\nbrightening still more, and taking on a most touching air of unreserve.\n“A captain is not expected to be familiar with his crew, and for\ncompany's sake in dull days and nights he turns to his book. Most of us\nold shipmasters came to know 'most everything about something; one would\ntake to readin' on farming topics, and some were great on medicine,--but\nLord help their poor crews!--or some were all for history, and now and\nthen there'd be one like me that gave his time to the poets. I was well\nacquainted with a shipmaster that was all for bees an' beekeepin'; and\nif you met him in port and went aboard, he'd sit and talk a terrible\nwhile about their havin' so much information, and the money that could\nbe made out of keepin' 'em. He was one of the smartest captains that\never sailed the seas, but they used to call the Newcastle, a great\nbark he commanded for many years, Tuttle's beehive. There was old Cap'n\nJameson: he had notions of Solomon's Temple, and made a very handsome\nlittle model of the same, right from the Scripture measurements, same's\nother sailors make little ships and design new tricks of rigging and all\nthat. No, there's nothing to take the place of shipping in a place like\nours. These bicycles offend me dreadfully; they don't afford no real\nopportunities of experience such as a man gained on a voyage. No: when\nfolks left home in the old days they left it to some purpose, and when\nthey got home they stayed there and had some pride in it. There's no\nlarge-minded way of thinking now: the worst have got to be best and rule\neverything; we're all turned upside down and going back year by year.”\n\n“Oh no, Captain Littlepage, I hope not,” said I, trying to soothe his\nfeelings.\n\nThere was a silence in the schoolhouse, but we could hear the noise of\nthe water on a beach below. It sounded like the strange warning wave\nthat gives notice of the turn of the tide. A late golden robin, with the\nmost joyful and eager of voices, was singing close by in a thicket of\nwild roses.\n\n\n\n\nVI. The Waiting Place\n\n“HOW DID YOU manage with the rest of that rough voyage on the Minerva?”\n I asked.\n\n“I shall be glad to explain to you,” said Captain Littlepage, forgetting\nhis grievances for the moment. “If I had a map at hand I could explain\nbetter. We were driven to and fro 'way up toward what we used to call\nParry's Discoveries, and lost our bearings. It was thick and foggy,\nand at last I lost my ship; she drove on a rock, and we managed to get\nashore on what I took to be a barren island, the few of us that were\nleft alive. When she first struck, the sea was somewhat calmer than it\nhad been, and most of the crew, against orders, manned the long-boat and\nput off in a hurry, and were never heard of more. Our own boat upset,\nbut the carpenter kept himself and me above water, and we drifted in.\nI had no strength to call upon after my recent fever, and laid down to\ndie; but he found the tracks of a man and dog the second day, and\ngot along the shore to one of those far missionary stations that the\nMoravians support. They were very poor themselves, and in distress;\n'twas a useless place. There were but few Esquimaux left in that region.\nThere we remained for some time, and I became acquainted with strange\nevents.”\n\nThe captain lifted his head and gave me a questioning glance. I could\nnot help noticing that the dulled look in his eyes had gone, and there\nwas instead a clear intentness that made them seem dark and piercing.\n\n“There was a supply ship expected, and the pastor, an excellent\nChristian man, made no doubt that we should get passage in her. He was\nhoping that orders would come to break up the station; but everything\nwas uncertain, and we got on the best we could for a while. We fished,\nand helped the people in other ways; there was no other way of paying\nour debts. I was taken to the pastor's house until I got better; but\nthey were crowded, and I felt myself in the way, and made excuse to join\nwith an old seaman, a Scotchman, who had built him a warm cabin, and had\nroom in it for another. He was looked upon with regard, and had stood by\nthe pastor in some troubles with the people. He had been on one of those\nEnglish exploring parties that found one end of the road to the north\npole, but never could find the other. We lived like dogs in a kennel, or\nso you'd thought if you had seen the hut from the outside; but the main\nthing was to keep warm; there were piles of bird-skins to lie on, and\nhe'd made him a good bunk, and there was another for me. 'Twas dreadful\ndreary waitin' there; we begun to think the supply steamer was lost, and\nmy poor ship broke up and strewed herself all along the shore. We got to\nwatching on the headlands; my men and me knew the people were short of\nsupplies and had to pinch themselves. It ought to read in the Bible,\n'Man cannot live by fish alone,' if they'd told the truth of things;\n'taint bread that wears the worst on you! First part of the time, old\nGaffett, that I lived with, seemed speechless, and I didn't know what to\nmake of him, nor he of me, I dare say; but as we got acquainted, I\nfound he'd been through more disasters than I had, and had troubles that\nwa'n't going to let him live a great while. It used to ease his mind to\ntalk to an understanding person, so we used to sit and talk together\nall day, if it rained or blew so that we couldn't get out. I'd got a bad\nblow on the back of my head at the time we came ashore, and it pained\nme at times, and my strength was broken, anyway; I've never been so able\nsince.”\n\nCaptain Littlepage fell into a reverie.\n\n“Then I had the good of my reading,” he explained presently. “I had\nno books; the pastor spoke but little English, and all his books were\nforeign; but I used to say over all I could remember. The old poets\nlittle knew what comfort they could be to a man. I was well acquainted\nwith the works of Milton, but up there it did seem to me as if\nShakespeare was the king; he has his sea terms very accurate, and some\nbeautiful passages were calming to the mind. I could say them over until\nI shed tears; there was nothing beautiful to me in that place but the\nstars above and those passages of verse.\n\n“Gaffett was always brooding and brooding, and talking to himself; he\nwas afraid he should never get away, and it preyed upon his mind. He\nthought when I got home I could interest the scientific men in his\ndiscovery: but they're all taken up with their own notions; some didn't\neven take pains to answer the letters I wrote. You observe that I said\nthis crippled man Gaffett had been shipped on a voyage of discovery. I\nnow tell you that the ship was lost on its return, and only Gaffett and\ntwo officers were saved off the Greenland coast, and he had knowledge\nlater that those men never got back to England; the brig they shipped on\nwas run down in the night. So no other living soul had the facts, and\nhe gave them to me. There is a strange sort of a country 'way up north\nbeyond the ice, and strange folks living in it. Gaffett believed it was\nthe next world to this.”\n\n“What do you mean, Captain Littlepage?” I exclaimed. The old man was\nbending forward and whispering; he looked over his shoulder before he\nspoke the last sentence.\n\n“To hear old Gaffett tell about it was something awful,” he said, going\non with his story quite steadily after the moment of excitement had\npassed. “'Twas first a tale of dogs and sledges, and cold and wind and\nsnow. Then they begun to find the ice grow rotten; they had been frozen\nin, and got into a current flowing north, far up beyond Fox Channel,\nand they took to their boats when the ship got crushed, and this warm\ncurrent took them out of sight of the ice, and into a great open sea;\nand they still followed it due north, just the very way they had planned\nto go. Then they struck a coast that wasn't laid down or charted, but\nthe cliffs were such that no boat could land until they found a bay and\nstruck across under sail to the other side where the shore looked lower;\nthey were scant of provisions and out of water, but they got sight of\nsomething that looked like a great town. 'For God's sake, Gaffett!' said\nI, the first time he told me. 'You don't mean a town two degrees farther\nnorth than ships had ever been?' for he'd got their course marked on an\nold chart that he'd pieced out at the top; but he insisted upon it, and\ntold it over and over again, to be sure I had it straight to carry to\nthose who would be interested. There was no snow and ice, he said, after\nthey had sailed some days with that warm current, which seemed to come\nright from under the ice that they'd been pinched up in and had been\ncrossing on foot for weeks.”\n\n“But what about the town?” I asked. “Did they get to the town?”\n\n“They did,” said the captain, “and found inhabitants; 'twas an awful\ncondition of things. It appeared, as near as Gaffett could express it,\nlike a place where there was neither living nor dead. They could see the\nplace when they were approaching it by sea pretty near like any town,\nand thick with habitations; but all at once they lost sight of it\naltogether, and when they got close inshore they could see the shapes\nof folks, but they never could get near them,--all blowing gray figures\nthat would pass along alone, or sometimes gathered in companies as if\nthey were watching. The men were frightened at first, but the shapes\nnever came near them,--it was as if they blew back; and at last they all\ngot bold and went ashore, and found birds' eggs and sea fowl, like any\nwild northern spot where creatures were tame and folks had never been,\nand there was good water. Gaffett said that he and another man came near\none o' the fog-shaped men that was going along slow with the look of a\npack on his back, among the rocks, an' they chased him; but, Lord! he\nflittered away out o' sight like a leaf the wind takes with it, or a\npiece of cobweb. They would make as if they talked together, but there\nwas no sound of voices, and 'they acted as if they didn't see us, but\nonly felt us coming towards them,' says Gaffett one day, trying to tell\nthe particulars. They couldn't see the town when they were ashore. One\nday the captain and the doctor were gone till night up across the high\nland where the town had seemed to be, and they came back at night\nbeat out and white as ashes, and wrote and wrote all next day in their\nnotebooks, and whispered together full of excitement, and they were\nsharp-spoken with the men when they offered to ask any questions.\n\n“Then there came a day,” said Captain Littlepage, leaning toward me with\na strange look in his eyes, and whispering quickly. “The men all swore\nthey wouldn't stay any longer; the man on watch early in the morning\ngave the alarm, and they all put off in the boat and got a little way\nout to sea. Those folks, or whatever they were, come about 'em like\nbats; all at once they raised incessant armies, and come as if to drive\n'em back to sea. They stood thick at the edge o' the water like the\nridges o' grim war; no thought o' flight, none of retreat. Sometimes\na standing fight, then soaring on main wing tormented all the air.\nAnd when they'd got the boat out o' reach o' danger, Gaffett said they\nlooked back, and there was the town again, standing up just as they'd\nseen it first, comin' on the coast. Say what you might, they all\nbelieved 'twas a kind of waiting-place between this world an' the next.”\n\nThe captain had sprung to his feet in his excitement, and made excited\ngestures, but he still whispered huskily.\n\n“Sit down, sir,” I said as quietly as I could, and he sank into his\nchair quite spent.\n\n“Gaffett thought the officers were hurrying home to report and to fit\nout a new expedition when they were all lost. At the time, the men\ngot orders not to talk over what they had seen,” the old man explained\npresently in a more natural tone.\n\n“Weren't they all starving, and wasn't it a mirage or something of that\nsort?” I ventured to ask. But he looked at me blankly.\n\n“Gaffett had got so that his mind ran on nothing else,” he went on. “The\nship's surgeon let fall an opinion to the captain, one day, that 'twas\nsome condition o' the light and the magnetic currents that let them see\nthose folks. 'Twa'n't a right-feeling part of the world, anyway; they\nhad to battle with the compass to make it serve, an' everything seemed\nto go wrong. Gaffett had worked it out in his own mind that they was\nall common ghosts, but the conditions were unusual favorable for seeing\nthem. He was always talking about the Ge'graphical Society, but he never\ntook proper steps, as I viewed it now, and stayed right there at the\nmission. He was a good deal crippled, and thought they'd confine him in\nsome jail of a hospital. He said he was waiting to find the right men to\ntell, somebody bound north. Once in a while they stopped there to leave\na mail or something. He was set in his notions, and let two or three\nproper explorin' expeditions go by him because he didn't like their\nlooks; but when I was there he had got restless, fearin' he might be\ntaken away or something. He had all his directions written out straight\nas a string to give the right ones. I wanted him to trust 'em to me,\nso I might have something to show, but he wouldn't. I suppose he's dead\nnow. I wrote to him an' I done all I could. 'Twill be a great exploit\nsome o' these days.”\n\nI assented absent-mindedly, thinking more just then of my companion's\nalert, determined look and the seafaring, ready aspect that had come to\nhis face; but at this moment there fell a sudden change, and the\nold, pathetic, scholarly look returned. Behind me hung a map of North\nAmerica, and I saw, as I turned a little, that his eyes were fixed upon\nthe northernmost regions and their careful recent outlines with a look\nof bewilderment.\n\n\n\n\nVII. The Outer Island\n\n\nGAFFETT WITH HIS good bunk and the bird-skins, the story of the wreck\nof the Minerva, the human-shaped creatures of fog and cobweb, the great\nwords of Milton with which he described their onslaught upon the crew,\nall this moving tale had such an air of truth that I could not argue\nwith Captain Littlepage. The old man looked away from the map as if it\nhad vaguely troubled him, and regarded me appealingly.\n\n“We were just speaking of”--and he stopped. I saw that he had suddenly\nforgotten his subject.\n\n“There were a great many persons at the funeral,” I hastened to say.\n\n“Oh yes,” the captain answered, with satisfaction. “All showed respect\nwho could. The sad circumstances had for a moment slipped my mind. Yes,\nMrs. Begg will be very much missed. She was a capital manager for her\nhusband when he was at sea. Oh yes, shipping is a very great loss.” And\nhe sighed heavily. “There was hardly a man of any standing who didn't\ninterest himself in some way in navigation. It always gave credit to a\ntown. I call it low-water mark now here in Dunnet.”\n\nHe rose with dignity to take leave, and asked me to stop at his house\nsome day, when he would show me some outlandish things that he had\nbrought home from sea. I was familiar with the subject of the decadence\nof shipping interests in all its affecting branches, having been already\nsome time in Dunnet, and I felt sure that Captain Littlepage's mind had\nnow returned to a safe level.\n\nAs we came down the hill toward the village our ways divided, and when\nI had seen the old captain well started on a smooth piece of sidewalk\nwhich would lead him to his own door, we parted, the best of friends.\n“Step in some afternoon,” he said, as affectionately as if I were a\nfellow-shipmaster wrecked on the lee shore of age like himself. I\nturned toward home, and presently met Mrs. Todd coming toward me with an\nanxious expression.\n\n“I see you sleevin' the old gentleman down the hill,” she suggested.\n\n“Yes. I've had a very interesting afternoon with him,” I answered, and\nher face brightened.\n\n“Oh, then he's all right. I was afraid 'twas one o' his flighty spells,\nan' Mari' Harris wouldn't”--\n\n“Yes,” I returned, smiling, “he has been telling me some old stories,\nbut we talked about Mrs. Begg and the funeral beside, and Paradise\nLost.”\n\n“I expect he got tellin' of you some o' his great narratives,” she\nanswered, looking at me shrewdly. “Funerals always sets him goin'. Some\no' them tales hangs together toler'ble well,” she added, with a sharper\nlook than before. “An' he's been a great reader all his seafarin' days.\nSome thinks he overdid, and affected his head, but for a man o' his\nyears he's amazin' now when he's at his best. Oh, he used to be a\nbeautiful man!”\n\n\nWe were standing where there was a fine view of the harbor and its long\nstretches of shore all covered by the great army of the pointed firs,\ndarkly cloaked and standing as if they waited to embark. As we looked\nfar seaward among the outer islands, the trees seemed to march seaward\nstill, going steadily over the heights and down to the water's edge.\n\nIt had been growing gray and cloudy, like the first evening of autumn,\nand a shadow had fallen on the darkening shore. Suddenly, as we looked,\na gleam of golden sunshine struck the outer islands, and one of them\nshone out clear in the light, and revealed itself in a compelling way to\nour eyes. Mrs. Todd was looking off across the bay with a face full of\naffection and interest. The sunburst upon that outermost island made\nit seem like a sudden revelation of the world beyond this which some\nbelieve to be so near.\n\n“That's where mother lives,” said Mrs. Todd. “Can't we see it plain? I\nwas brought up out there on Green Island. I know every rock an' bush on\nit.”\n\n“Your mother!” I exclaimed, with great interest.\n\n“Yes, dear, cert'in; I've got her yet, old's I be. She's one of them\nspry, light-footed little women; always was, an' light-hearted, too,”\n answered Mrs. Todd, with satisfaction. “She's seen all the trouble folks\ncan see, without it's her last sickness; an' she's got a word of courage\nfor everybody. Life ain't spoilt her a mite. She's eighty-six an' I'm\nsixty-seven, and I've seen the time I've felt a good sight the oldest.\n'Land sakes alive!' says she, last time I was out to see her. 'How you\ndo lurch about steppin' into a bo't?' I laughed so I liked to have gone\nright over into the water; an' we pushed off, an' left her laughin'\nthere on the shore.”\n\nThe light had faded as we watched. Mrs. Todd had mounted a gray rock,\nand stood there grand and architectural, like a caryatide. Presently she\nstepped down, and we continued our way homeward.\n\n“You an' me, we'll take a bo't an' go out some day and see mother,”\n she promised me. “'Twould please her very much, an' there's one or two\nsca'ce herbs grows better on the island than anywhere else. I ain't seen\ntheir like nowheres here on the main.”\n\n“Now I'm goin' right down to get us each a mug o' my beer,” she\nannounced as we entered the house, “an' I believe I'll sneak in a little\nmite o' camomile. Goin' to the funeral an' all, I feel to have had a\nvery wearin' afternoon.”\n\nI heard her going down into the cool little cellar, and then there was\nconsiderable delay. When she returned, mug in hand, I noticed the taste\nof camomile, in spite of my protest; but its flavor was disguised by\nsome other herb that I did not know, and she stood over me until I drank\nit all and said that I liked it.\n\n“I don't give that to everybody,” said Mrs. Todd kindly; and I felt for\na moment as if it were part of a spell and incantation, and as if my\nenchantress would now begin to look like the cobweb shapes of the arctic\ntown. Nothing happened but a quiet evening and some delightful plans\nthat we made about going to Green Island, and on the morrow there was\nthe clear sunshine and blue sky of another day.\n\n\n\n\nVIII. Green Island\n\nONE MORNING, very early, I heard Mrs. Todd in the garden outside my\nwindow. By the unusual loudness of her remarks to a passer-by, and the\nnotes of a familiar hymn which she sang as she worked among the herbs,\nand which came as if directed purposely to the sleepy ears of my\nconsciousness, I knew that she wished I would wake up and come and speak\nto her.\n\nIn a few minutes she responded to a morning voice from behind the\nblinds. “I expect you're goin' up to your schoolhouse to pass all this\npleasant day; yes, I expect you're goin' to be dreadful busy,” she said\ndespairingly.\n\n“Perhaps not,” said I. “Why, what's going to be the matter with you,\nMrs. Todd?” For I supposed that she was tempted by the fine weather to\ntake one of her favorite expeditions along the shore pastures to gather\nherbs and simples, and would like to have me keep the house.\n\n“No, I don't want to go nowhere by land,” she answered gayly,--“no, not\nby land; but I don't know's we shall have a better day all the rest of\nthe summer to go out to Green Island an' see mother. I waked up early\nthinkin' of her. The wind's light northeast,--'twill take us right\nstraight out, an' this time o' year it's liable to change round\nsouthwest an' fetch us home pretty, 'long late in the afternoon. Yes,\nit's goin' to be a good day.”\n\n“Speak to the captain and the Bowden boy, if you see anybody going by\ntoward the landing,” said I. “We'll take the big boat.”\n\n“Oh, my sakes! now you let me do things my way,” said Mrs. Todd\nscornfully. “No, dear, we won't take no big bo't. I'll just git a handy\ndory, an' Johnny Bowden an' me, we'll man her ourselves. I don't want no\nabler bo't than a good dory, an' a nice light breeze ain't goin' to make\nno sea; an' Johnny's my cousin's son,--mother'll like to have him come;\nan' he'll be down to the herrin' weirs all the time we're there, anyway;\nwe don't want to carry no men folks havin' to be considered every minute\nan' takin' up all our time. No, you let me do; we'll just slip out an'\nsee mother by ourselves. I guess what breakfast you'll want's about\nready now.”\n\nI had become well acquainted with Mrs. Todd as landlady, herb-gatherer,\nand rustic philosopher; we had been discreet fellow-passengers once\nor twice when I had sailed up the coast to a larger town than Dunnet\nLanding to do some shopping; but I was yet to become acquainted with\nher as a mariner. An hour later we pushed off from the landing in the\ndesired dory. The tide was just on the turn, beginning to fall,\nand several friends and acquaintances stood along the side of the\ndilapidated wharf and cheered us by their words and evident interest.\nJohnny Bowden and I were both rowing in haste to get out where we could\ncatch the breeze and put up the small sail which lay clumsily furled\nalong the gunwale. Mrs. Todd sat aft, a stern and unbending lawgiver.\n\n“You better let her drift; we'll get there 'bout as quick; the tide'll\ntake her right out from under these old buildin's; there's plenty wind\noutside.”\n\n“Your bo't ain't trimmed proper, Mis' Todd!” exclaimed a voice from\nshore. “You're lo'ded so the bo't'll drag; you can't git her before\nthe wind, ma'am. You set 'midships, Mis' Todd, an' let the boy hold the\nsheet 'n' steer after he gits the sail up; you won't never git out to\nGreen Island that way. She's lo'ded bad, your bo't is,--she's heavy\nbehind's she is now!”\n\nMrs. Todd turned with some difficulty and regarded the anxious adviser,\nmy right oar flew out of water, and we seemed about to capsize. “That\nyou, Asa? Good-mornin',” she said politely. “I al'ays liked the starn\nseat best. When'd you git back from up country?”\n\nThis allusion to Asa's origin was not lost upon the rest of the company.\nWe were some little distance from shore, but we could hear a chuckle\nof laughter, and Asa, a person who was too ready with his criticism and\nadvice on every possible subject, turned and walked indignantly away.\n\nWhen we caught the wind we were soon on our seaward course, and only\nstopped to underrun a trawl, for the floats of which Mrs. Todd looked\nearnestly, explaining that her mother might not be prepared for three\nextra to dinner; it was her brother's trawl, and she meant to just run\nher eye along for the right sort of a little haddock. I leaned over the\nboat's side with great interest and excitement, while she skillfully\nhandled the long line of hooks, and made scornful remarks upon\nworthless, bait-consuming creatures of the sea as she reviewed them and\nleft them on the trawl or shook them off into the waves. At last we came\nto what she pronounced a proper haddock, and having taken him on board\nand ended his life resolutely, we went our way.\n\nAs we sailed along I listened to an increasingly delightful commentary\nupon the islands, some of them barren rocks, or at best giving sparse\npasturage for sheep in the early summer. On one of these an eager little\nflock ran to the water's edge and bleated at us so affectingly that I\nwould willingly have stopped; but Mrs. Todd steered away from the rocks,\nand scolded at the sheep's mean owner, an acquaintance of hers, who\ngrudged the little salt and still less care which the patient creatures\nneeded. The hot midsummer sun makes prisons of these small islands\nthat are a paradise in early June, with their cool springs and short\nthick-growing grass. On a larger island, farther out to sea, my\nentertaining companion showed me with glee the small houses of two\nfarmers who shared the island between them, and declared that for three\ngenerations the people had not spoken to each other even in times of\nsickness or death or birth. “When the news come that the war was over,\none of 'em knew it a week, and never stepped across his wall to tell the\nother,” she said. “There, they enjoy it; they've got to have somethin'\nto interest 'em in such a place; 'tis a good deal more tryin' to be\ntied to folks you don't like than 'tis to be alone. Each of 'em tell\nthe neighbors their wrongs; plenty likes to hear and tell again; them\nas fetch a bone'll carry one, an' so they keep the fight a-goin'. I must\nsay I like variety myself; some folks washes Monday an' irons Tuesday\nthe whole year round, even if the circus is goin' by!”\n\nA long time before we landed at Green Island we could see the small\nwhite house, standing high like a beacon, where Mrs. Todd was born and\nwhere her mother lived, on a green slope above the water, with dark\nspruce woods still higher. There were crops in the fields, which we\npresently distinguished from one another. Mrs. Todd examined them while\nwe were still far at sea. “Mother's late potatoes looks backward; ain't\nhad rain enough so far,” she pronounced her opinion. “They look weedier\nthan what they call Front Street down to Cowper Centre. I expect brother\nWilliam is so occupied with his herrin' weirs an' servin' out bait to\nthe schooners that he don't think once a day of the land.”\n\n“What's the flag for, up above the spruces there behind the house?” I\ninquired, with eagerness.\n\n“Oh, that's the sign for herrin',” she explained kindly, while Johnny\nBowden regarded me with contemptuous surprise. “When they get enough for\nschooners they raise that flag; an' when 'tis a poor catch in the weir\npocket they just fly a little signal down by the shore, an' then the\nsmall bo'ts comes and get enough an' over for their trawls. There, look!\nthere she is: mother sees us; she's wavin' somethin' out o' the fore\ndoor! She'll be to the landin'-place quick's we are.”\n\nI looked, and could see a tiny flutter in the doorway, but a quicker\nsignal had made its way from the heart on shore to the heart on the sea.\n\n“How do you suppose she knows it is me?” said Mrs. Todd, with a tender\nsmile on her broad face. “There, you never get over bein' a child long's\nyou have a mother to go to. Look at the chimney, now; she's gone right\nin an' brightened up the fire. Well, there, I'm glad mother's well;\nyou'll enjoy seein' her very much.”\n\nMrs. Todd leaned back into her proper position, and the boat trimmed\nagain. She took a firmer grasp of the sheet, and gave an impatient look\nup at the gaff and the leech of the little sail, and twitched the sheet\nas if she urged the wind like a horse. There came at once a fresh gust,\nand we seemed to have doubled our speed. Soon we were near enough to see\na tiny figure with handkerchiefed head come down across the field and\nstand waiting for us at the cove above a curve of pebble beach.\n\nPresently the dory grated on the pebbles, and Johnny Bowden, who had\nbeen kept in abeyance during the voyage, sprang out and used manful\nexertions to haul us up with the next wave, so that Mrs. Todd could make\na dry landing.\n\n“You don that very well,” she said, mounting to her feet, and\ncoming ashore somewhat stiffly, but with great dignity, refusing our\noutstretched hands, and returning to possess herself of a bag which had\nlain at her feet.\n\n“Well, mother, here I be!” she announced with indifference; but they\nstood and beamed in each other's faces.\n\n“Lookin' pretty well for an old lady, ain't she?” said Mrs. Todd's\nmother, turning away from her daughter to speak to me. She was a\ndelightful little person herself, with bright eyes and an affectionate\nair of expectation like a child on a holiday. You felt as if Mrs.\nBlackett were an old and dear friend before you let go her cordial hand.\nWe all started together up the hill.\n\n“Now don't you haste too fast, mother,” said Mrs. Todd warningly; “'tis\na far reach o' risin' ground to the fore door, and you won't set an' get\nyour breath when you're once there, but go trotting about. Now don't\nyou go a mite faster than we proceed with this bag an' basket. Johnny,\nthere, 'll fetch up the haddock. I just made one stop to underrun\nWilliam's trawl till I come to jes' such a fish's I thought you'd want\nto make one o' your nice chowders of. I've brought an onion with me that\nwas layin' about on the window-sill at home.”\n\n“That's just what I was wantin',” said the hostess. “I give a sigh\nwhen you spoke o' chowder, knowin' my onions was out. William forgot\nto replenish us last time he was to the Landin'. Don't you haste so\nyourself Almiry, up this risin' ground. I hear you commencin' to wheeze\na'ready.”\n\nThis mild revenge seemed to afford great pleasure to both giver\nand receiver. They laughed a little, and looked at each other\naffectionately, and then at me. Mrs. Todd considerately paused, and\nfaced about to regard the wide sea view. I was glad to stop, being more\nout of breath than either of my companions, and I prolonged the halt\nby asking the names of the neighboring islands. There was a fine breeze\nblowing, which we felt more there on the high land than when we were\nrunning before it in the dory.\n\n“Why, this ain't that kitten I saw when I was out last, the one that I\nsaid didn't appear likely?” exclaimed Mrs. Todd as we went our way.\n\n“That's the one, Almiry,” said her mother. “She always had a likely look\nto me, an' she's right after business. I never see such a mouser for\none of her age. If't wan't for William, I never should have housed that\nother dronin' old thing so long; but he sets by her on account of her\nhavin' a bob tail. I don't deem it advisable to maintain cats just on\naccount of their havin' bob tails; they're like all other curiosities,\ngood for them that wants to see 'm twice. This kitten catches mice for\nboth, an' keeps me respectable as I ain't been for a year. She's a real\nunderstandin' little help, this kitten is. I picked her from among five\nMiss Augusta Pernell had over to Burnt Island,” said the old woman,\ntrudging along with the kitten close at her skirts. “Augusta, she says\nto me, 'Why, Mis' Blackett, you've took and homeliest;' and, says I,\n'I've got the smartest; I'm satisfied.'”\n\n“I'd trust nobody sooner'n you to pick out a kitten, mother,” said the\ndaughter handsomely, and we went on in peace and harmony.\n\nThe house was just before us now, on a green level that looked as if\na huge hand had scooped it out of the long green field we had been\nascending. A little way above, the dark, spruce woods began to climb the\ntop of the hill and cover the seaward slopes of the island. There was\njust room for the small farm and the forest; we looked down at the\nfish-house and its rough sheds, and the weirs stretching far out into\nthe water. As we looked upward, the tops of the firs came sharp against\nthe blue sky. There was a great stretch of rough pasture-land round\nthe shoulder of the island to the eastward, and here were all the\nthick-scattered gray rocks that kept their places, and the gray backs\nof many sheep that forever wandered and fed on the thin sweet pasturage\nthat fringed the ledges and made soft hollows and strips of green turf\nlike growing velvet. I could see the rich green of bayberry bushes here\nand there, where the rocks made room. The air was very sweet; one could\nnot help wishing to be a citizen of such a complete and tiny continent\nand home of fisherfolk.\n\nThe house was broad and clean, with a roof that looked heavy on its low\nwalls. It was one of the houses that seem firm-rooted in the ground, as\nif they were two-thirds below the surface, like icebergs. The front door\nstood hospitably open in expectation of company, and an orderly\nvine grew at each side; but our path led to the kitchen door at the\nhouse-end, and there grew a mass of gay flowers and greenery, as if they\nhad been swept together by some diligent garden broom into a tangled\nheap: there were portulacas all along under the lower step and\nstraggling off into the grass, and clustering mallows that crept as near\nas they dared, like poor relations. I saw the bright eyes and brainless\nlittle heads of two half-grown chickens who were snuggled down among the\nmallows as if they had been chased away from the door more than once,\nand expected to be again.\n\n“It seems kind o' formal comin' in this way,” said Mrs. Todd\nimpulsively, as we passed the flowers and came to the front doorstep;\nbut she was mindful of the proprieties, and walked before us into the\nbest room on the left.\n\n“Why, mother, if you haven't gone an' turned the carpet!” she exclaimed,\nwith something in her voice that spoke of awe and admiration. “When'd\nyou get to it? I s'pose Mis' Addicks come over an' helped you, from\nWhite Island Landing?”\n\n“No, she didn't,” answered the old woman, standing proudly erect, and\nmaking the most of a great moment. “I done it all myself with William's\nhelp. He had a spare day, an' took right holt with me; an' 'twas all\nwell beat on the grass, an' turned, an' put down again afore we went to\nbed. I ripped an' sewed over two o' them long breadths. I ain't had such\na good night's sleep for two years.”\n\n“There, what do you think o' havin' such a mother as that for eighty-six\nyear old?” said Mrs. Todd, standing before us like a large figure of\nVictory.\n\nAs for the mother, she took on a sudden look of youth; you felt as if\nshe promised a great future, and was beginning, not ending, her summers\nand their happy toils.\n\n“My, my!” exclaimed Mrs. Todd. “I couldn't ha' done it myself, I've got\nto own it.”\n\n“I was much pleased to have it off my mind,” said Mrs. Blackett, humbly;\n“the more so because along at the first of the next week I wasn't very\nwell. I suppose it may have been the change of weather.”\n\nMrs. Todd could not resist a significant glance at me, but, with\ncharming sympathy, she forbore to point the lesson or to connect this\nillness with its apparent cause. She loomed larger than ever in the\nlittle old-fashioned best room, with its few pieces of good furniture\nand pictures of national interest. The green paper curtains were\nstamped with conventional landscapes of a foreign order,--castles\non inaccessible crags, and lovely lakes with steep wooded shores;\nunder-foot the treasured carpet was covered thick with home-made rugs.\nThere were empty glass lamps and crystallized bouquets of grass and some\nfine shells on the narrow mantelpiece.\n\n“I was married in this room,” said Mrs. Todd unexpectedly; and I heard\nher give a sigh after she had spoken, as if she could not help the touch\nof regret that would forever come with all her thoughts of happiness.\n\n“We stood right there between the windows,” she added, “and the minister\nstood here. William wouldn't come in. He was always odd about seein'\nfolks, just's he is now. I run to meet 'em from a child, an' William,\nhe'd take an' run away.”\n\n“I've been the gainer,” said the old mother cheerfully. “William has\nbeen son an' daughter both since you was married off the island. He's\nbeen 'most too satisfied to stop at home 'long o' his old mother, but I\nalways tell 'em I'm the gainer.”\n\nWe were all moving toward the kitchen as if by common instinct. The best\nroom was too suggestive of serious occasions, and the shades were\nall pulled down to shut out the summer light and air. It was indeed a\ntribute to Society to find a room set apart for her behests out there\non so apparently neighborless and remote an island. Afternoon visits\nand evening festivals must be few in such a bleak situation at certain\nseasons of the year, but Mrs. Blackett was of those who do not live to\nthemselves, and who have long since passed the line that divides mere\nself-concern from a valued share in whatever Society can give and take.\nThere were those of her neighbors who never had taken the trouble to\nfurnish a best room, but Mrs. Blackett was one who knew the uses of a\nparlor.\n\n“Yes, do come right out into the old kitchen; I shan't make any stranger\nof you,” she invited us pleasantly, after we had been properly received\nin the room appointed to formality. “I expect Almiry, here, 'll be\ndriftin' out 'mongst the pasture-weeds quick's she can find a good\nexcuse. 'Tis hot now. You'd better content yourselves till you get nice\nan' rested, an' 'long after dinner the sea-breeze 'll spring up, an'\nthen you can take your walks, an' go up an' see the prospect from the\nbig ledge. Almiry'll want to show off everything there is. Then I'll get\nyou a good cup o' tea before you start to go home. The days are plenty\nlong now.”\n\nWhile we were talking in the best room the selected fish had been\nmysteriously brought up from the shore, and lay all cleaned and ready in\nan earthen crock on the table.\n\n“I think William might have just stopped an' said a word,” remarked\nMrs. Todd, pouting with high affront as she caught sight of it. “He's\nfriendly enough when he comes ashore, an' was remarkable social the last\ntime, for him.”\n\n“He ain't disposed to be very social with the ladies,” explained\nWilliam's mother, with a delightful glance at me, as if she counted upon\nmy friendship and tolerance. “He's very particular, and he's all in his\nold fishin'-clothes to-day. He'll want me to tell him everything you\nsaid and done, after you've gone. William has very deep affections.\nHe'll want to see you, Almiry. Yes, I guess he'll be in by an' by.”\n\n“I'll search for him by 'n' by, if he don't,” proclaimed Mrs. Todd, with\nan air of unalterable resolution. “I know all of his burrows down 'long\nthe shore. I'll catch him by hand 'fore he knows it. I've got some\nbusiness with William, anyway. I brought forty-two cents with me that\nwas due him for them last lobsters he brought in.”\n\n“You can leave it with me,” suggested the little old mother, who was\nalready stepping about among her pots and pans in the pantry, and\npreparing to make the chowder.\n\nI became possessed of a sudden unwonted curiosity in regard to William,\nand felt that half the pleasure of my visit would be lost if I could not\nmake his interesting acquaintance.\n\n\n\n\nIX. William\n\nMRS. TODD HAD taken the onion out of her basket and laid it down upon\nthe kitchen table. “There's Johnny Bowden come with us, you know,” she\nreminded her mother. “He'll be hungry enough to eat his size.”\n\n“I've got new doughnuts, dear,” said the little old lady. “You don't\noften catch William 'n' me out o' provisions. I expect you might have\nchose a somewhat larger fish, but I'll try an' make it do. I shall have\nto have a few extra potatoes, but there's a field full out there,\nan' the hoe's leanin' against the well-house, in 'mongst the\nclimbin'-beans.” She smiled and gave her daughter a commanding nod.\n\n“Land sakes alive! Le's blow the horn for William,” insisted Mrs. Todd,\nwith some excitement. “He needn't break his spirit so far's to come in.\nHe'll know you need him for something particular, an' then we can call\nto him as he comes up the path. I won't put him to no pain.”\n\nMrs. Blackett's old face, for the first time, wore a look of trouble,\nand I found it necessary to counteract the teasing spirit of Almira.\nIt was too pleasant to stay indoors altogether, even in such rewarding\ncompanionship; besides, I might meet William; and, straying out\npresently, I found the hoe by the well-house and an old splint basket at\nthe woodshed door, and also found my way down to the field where there\nwas a great square patch of rough, weedy potato-tops and tall ragweed.\nOne corner was already dug, and I chose a fat-looking hill where the\ntops were well withered. There is all the pleasure that one can have in\ngold-digging in finding one's hopes satisfied in the riches of a good\nhill of potatoes. I longed to go on; but it did not seem frugal to dig\nany longer after my basket was full, and at last I took my hoe by the\nmiddle and lifted the basket to go back up the hill. I was sure that\nMrs. Blackett must be waiting impatiently to slice the potatoes into the\nchowder, layer after layer, with the fish.\n\n“You let me take holt o' that basket, ma'am,” said the pleasant, anxious\nvoice behind me.\n\nI turned, startled in the silence of the wide field, and saw an elderly\nman, bent in the shoulders as fishermen often are, gray-headed and\nclean-shaven, and with a timid air. It was William. He looked just like\nhis mother, and I had been imagining that he was large and stout like\nhis sister, Almira Todd; and, strange to say, my fancy had led me to\npicture him not far from thirty and a little loutish. It was necessary\ninstead to pay William the respect due to age.\n\nI accustomed myself to plain facts on the instant, and we said\ngood-morning like old friends. The basket was really heavy, and I put\nthe hoe through its handle and offered him one end; then we moved easily\ntoward the house together, speaking of the fine weather and of mackerel\nwhich were reported to be striking in all about the bay. William had\nbeen out since three o'clock, and had taken an extra fare of fish.\nI could feel that Mrs. Todd's eyes were upon us as we approached the\nhouse, and although I fell behind in the narrow path, and let William\ntake the basket alone and precede me at some little distance the rest of\nthe way, I could plainly hear her greet him.\n\n“Got round to comin' in, didn't you?” she inquired, with amusement.\n“Well, now, that's clever. Didn't know's I should see you to-day,\nWilliam, an' I wanted to settle an account.”\n\nI felt somewhat disturbed and responsible, but when I joined them they\nwere on most simple and friendly terms. It became evident that, with\nWilliam, it was the first step that cost, and that, having once joined\nin social interests, he was able to pursue them with more or less\npleasure. He was about sixty, and not young-looking for his years, yet\nso undying is the spirit of youth, and bashfulness has such a power\nof survival, that I felt all the time as if one must try to make the\noccasion easy for some one who was young and new to the affairs of\nsocial life. He asked politely if I would like to go up to the great\nledge while dinner was getting ready; so, not without a deep sense of\npleasure, and a delighted look of surprise from the two hostesses,\nwe started, William and I, as if both of us felt much younger than we\nlooked. Such was the innocence and simplicity of the moment that when\nI heard Mrs. Todd laughing behind us in the kitchen I laughed too, but\nWilliam did not even blush. I think he was a little deaf, and he stepped\nalong before me most businesslike and intent upon his errand.\n\nWe went from the upper edge of the field above the house into a smooth,\nbrown path among the dark spruces. The hot sun brought out the fragrance\nof the pitchy bark, and the shade was pleasant as we climbed the hill.\nWilliam stopped once or twice to show me a great wasps'-nest close by,\nor some fishhawks'-nests below in a bit of swamp. He picked a few sprigs\nof late-blooming linnaea as we came out upon an open bit of pasture at\nthe top of the island, and gave them to me without speaking, but he\nknew as well as I that one could not say half he wished about linnaea.\nThrough this piece of rough pasture ran a huge shape of stone like the\ngreat backbone of an enormous creature. At the end, near the woods, we\ncould climb up on it and walk along to the highest point; there above\nthe circle of pointed firs we could look down over all the island, and\ncould see the ocean that circled this and a hundred other bits of island\nground, the mainland shore and all the far horizons. It gave a sudden\nsense of space, for nothing stopped the eye or hedged one in,--that\nsense of liberty in space and time which great prospects always give.\n\n“There ain't no such view in the world, I expect,” said William\nproudly, and I hastened to speak my heartfelt tribute of praise; it was\nimpossible not to feel as if an untraveled boy had spoken, and yet one\nloved to have him value his native heath.\n\n\n\n\nX. Where Pennyroyal Grew\n\nWE WERE a little late to dinner, but Mrs. Blackett and Mrs. Todd were\nlenient, and we all took our places after William had paused to wash his\nhands, like a pious Brahmin, at the well, and put on a neat blue coat\nwhich he took from a peg behind the kitchen door. Then he resolutely\nasked a blessing in words that I could not hear, and we ate the chowder\nand were thankful. The kitten went round and round the table, quite\nerect, and, holding on by her fierce young claws, she stopped to mew\nwith pathos at each elbow, or darted off to the open door when a song\nsparrow forgot himself and lit in the grass too near. William did not\ntalk much, but his sister Todd occupied the time and told all the news\nthere was to tell of Dunnet Landing and its coasts, while the old mother\nlistened with delight. Her hospitality was something exquisite; she had\nthe gift which so many women lack, of being able to make themselves\nand their houses belong entirely to a guest's pleasure,--that charming\nsurrender for the moment of themselves and whatever belongs to them,\nso that they make a part of one's own life that can never be forgotten.\nTact is after all a kind of mindreading, and my hostess held the golden\ngift. Sympathy is of the mind as well as the heart, and Mrs. Blackett's\nworld and mine were one from the moment we met. Besides, she had that\nfinal, that highest gift of heaven, a perfect self-forgetfulness.\nSometimes, as I watched her eager, sweet old face, I wondered why she\nhad been set to shine on this lonely island of the northern coast.\nIt must have been to keep the balance true, and make up to all her\nscattered and depending neighbors for other things which they may have\nlacked.\n\nWhen we had finished clearing away the old blue plates, and the kitten\nhad taken care of her share of the fresh haddock, just as we were\nputting back the kitchen chairs in their places, Mrs. Todd said briskly\nthat she must go up into the pasture now to gather the desired herbs.\n\n“You can stop here an' rest, or you can accompany me,” she announced.\n“Mother ought to have her nap, and when we come back she an' William'll\nsing for you. She admires music,” said Mrs. Todd, turning to speak to\nher mother.\n\nBut Mrs. Blackett tried to say that she couldn't sing as she used, and\nperhaps William wouldn't feel like it. She looked tired, the good old\nsoul, or I should have liked to sit in the peaceful little house while\nshe slept; I had had much pleasant experience of pastures already in her\ndaughter's company. But it seemed best to go with Mrs. Todd, and off we\nwent.\n\nMrs. Todd carried the gingham bag which she had brought from home, and a\nsmall heavy burden in the bottom made it hang straight and slender from\nher hand. The way was steep, and she soon grew breathless, so that we\nsat down to rest awhile on a convenient large stone among the bayberry.\n\n“There, I wanted you to see this,--'tis mother's picture,” said Mrs.\nTodd; “'twas taken once when she was up to Portland soon after she\nwas married. That's me,” she added, opening another worn case, and\ndisplaying the full face of the cheerful child she looked like still in\nspite of being past sixty. “And here's William an' father together. I\ntake after father, large and heavy, an' William is like mother's folks,\nshort an' thin. He ought to have made something o' himself, bein' a man\nan' so like mother; but though he's been very steady to work, an' kept\nup the farm, an' done his fishin' too right along, he never had mother's\nsnap an' power o' seein' things just as they be. He's got excellent\njudgment, too,” meditated William's sister, but she could not arrive at\nany satisfactory decision upon what she evidently thought his failure in\nlife. “I think it is well to see any one so happy an' makin' the most\nof life just as it falls to hand,” she said as she began to put the\ndaguerreotypes away again; but I reached out my hand to see her mother's\nonce more, a most flowerlike face of a lovely young woman in quaint\ndress. There was in the eyes a look of anticipation and joy, a far-off\nlook that sought the horizon; one often sees it in seafaring families,\ninherited by girls and boys alike from men who spend their lives at sea,\nand are always watching for distant sails or the first loom of the\nland. At sea there is nothing to be seen close by, and this has its\ncounterpart in a sailor's character, in the large and brave and patient\ntraits that are developed, the hopeful pleasantness that one loves so in\na seafarer.\n\nWhen the family pictures were wrapped again in a big handkerchief, we\nset forward in a narrow footpath and made our way to a lonely place that\nfaced northward, where there was more pasturage and fewer bushes, and we\nwent down to the edge of short grass above some rocky cliffs where the\ndeep sea broke with a great noise, though the wind was down and the\nwater looked quiet a little way from shore. Among the grass grew such\npennyroyal as the rest of the world could not provide. There was a fine\nfragrance in the air as we gathered it sprig by sprig and stepped along\ncarefully, and Mrs. Todd pressed her aromatic nosegay between her hands\nand offered it to me again and again.\n\n“There's nothin' like it,” she said; “oh no, there's no such pennyr'yal\nas this in the state of Maine. It's the right pattern of the plant, and\nall the rest I ever see is but an imitation. Don't it do you good?” And\nI answered with enthusiasm.\n\n“There, dear, I never showed nobody else but mother where to find this\nplace; 'tis kind of sainted to me. Nathan, my husband, an' I used to\nlove this place when we was courtin', and”--she hesitated, and then\nspoke softly--“when he was lost, 'twas just off shore tryin' to get in\nby the short channel out there between Squaw Islands, right in sight o'\nthis headland where we'd set an' made our plans all summer long.”\n\nI had never heard her speak of her husband before, but I felt that we\nwere friends now since she had brought me to this place.\n\n“'Twas but a dream with us,” Mrs. Todd said. “I knew it when he was\ngone. I knew it”--and she whispered as if she were at confession--“I\nknew it afore he started to go to sea. My heart was gone out o' my\nkeepin' before I ever saw Nathan; but he loved me well, and he made me\nreal happy, and he died before he ever knew what he'd had to know if\nwe'd lived long together. 'Tis very strange about love. No, Nathan never\nfound out, but my heart was troubled when I knew him first. There's more\nwomen likes to be loved than there is of those that loves. I spent some\nhappy hours right here. I always liked Nathan, and he never knew. But\nthis pennyr'yal always reminded me, as I'd sit and gather it and hear\nhim talkin'--it always would remind me of--the other one.”\n\nShe looked away from me, and presently rose and went on by herself.\nThere was something lonely and solitary about her great determined\nshape. She might have been Antigone alone on the Theban plain. It is not\noften given in a noisy world to come to the places of great grief and\nsilence. An absolute, archaic grief possessed this countrywoman; she\nseemed like a renewal of some historic soul, with her sorrows and the\nremoteness of a daily life busied with rustic simplicities and the\nscents of primeval herbs.\n\n\nI was not incompetent at herb-gathering, and after a while, when I had\nsat long enough waking myself to new thoughts, and reading a page of\nremembrance with new pleasure, I gathered some bunches, as I was bound\nto do, and at last we met again higher up the shore, in the plain\nevery-day world we had left behind when we went down to the penny-royal\nplot. As we walked together along the high edge of the field we saw a\nhundred sails about the bay and farther seaward; it was mid-afternoon or\nafter, and the day was coming to an end.\n\n“Yes, they're all makin' towards the shore,--the small craft an' the\nlobster smacks an' all,” said my companion. “We must spend a little time\nwith mother now, just to have our tea, an' then put for home.”\n\n“No matter if we lose the wind at sundown; I can row in with Johnny,”\n said I; and Mrs. Todd nodded reassuringly and kept to her steady plod,\nnot quickening her gait even when we saw William come round the corner\nof the house as if to look for us, and wave his hand and disappear.\n\n“Why, William's right on deck; I didn't know's we should see any more of\nhim!” exclaimed Mrs. Todd. “Now mother'll put the kettle right on; she's\ngot a good fire goin'.” I too could see the blue smoke thicken, and then\nwe both walked a little faster, while Mrs. Todd groped in her full bag\nof herbs to find the daguerreotypes and be ready to put them in their\nplaces.\n\n\n\n\nXI. The Old Singers\n\nWILLIAM WAS sitting on the side door step, and the old mother was busy\nmaking her tea; she gave into my hand an old flowered-glass tea-caddy.\n\n“William thought you'd like to see this, when he was settin' the table.\nMy father brought it to my mother from the island of Tobago; an' here's\na pair of beautiful mugs that came with it.” She opened the glass door\nof a little cupboard beside the chimney. “These I call my best things,\ndear,” she said. “You'd laugh to see how we enjoy 'em Sunday nights in\nwinter: we have a real company tea 'stead o' livin' right along just\nthe same, an' I make somethin' good for a s'prise an' put on some o' my\npreserves, an' we get a'talkin' together an' have real pleasant times.”\n\nMrs. Todd laughed indulgently, and looked to see what I thought of such\nchildishness.\n\n“I wish I could be here some Sunday evening,” said I.\n\n“William an' me'll be talkin' about you an' thinkin' o' this nice day,”\n said Mrs. Blackett affectionately, and she glanced at William, and he\nlooked up bravely and nodded. I began to discover that he and his sister\ncould not speak their deeper feelings before each other.\n\n“Now I want you an' mother to sing,” said Mrs. Todd abruptly, with\nan air of command, and I gave William much sympathy in his evident\ndistress.\n\n“After I've had my cup o' tea, dear,” answered the old hostess\ncheerfully; and so we sat down and took our cups and made merry while\nthey lasted. It was impossible not to wish to stay on forever at Green\nIsland, and I could not help saying so.\n\n“I'm very happy here, both winter an' summer,” said old Mrs. Blackett.\n“William an' I never wish for any other home, do we, William? I'm glad\nyou find it pleasant; I wish you'd come an' stay, dear, whenever you\nfeel inclined. But here's Almiry; I always think Providence was kind\nto plot an' have her husband leave her a good house where she really\nbelonged. She'd been very restless if she'd had to continue here on\nGreen Island. You wanted more scope, didn't you, Almiry, an' to live in\na large place where more things grew? Sometimes folks wonders that\nwe don't live together; perhaps we shall some time,” and a shadow of\nsadness and apprehension flitted across her face. “The time o' sickness\nan' failin' has got to come to all. But Almiry's got an herb that's good\nfor everything.” She smiled as she spoke, and looked bright again.\n\n“There's some herb that's good for everybody, except for them that\nthinks they're sick when they ain't,” announced Mrs. Todd, with a truly\nprofessional air of finality. “Come, William, let's have Sweet Home, an'\nthen mother'll sing Cupid an' the Bee for us.”\n\nThen followed a most charming surprise. William mastered his timidity\nand began to sing. His voice was a little faint and frail, like the\nfamily daguerreotypes, but it was a tenor voice, and perfectly true\nand sweet. I have never heard Home, Sweet Home sung as touchingly and\nseriously as he sang it; he seemed to make it quite new; and when he\npaused for a moment at the end of the first line and began the next,\nthe old mother joined him and they sang together, she missing only the\nhigher notes, where he seemed to lend his voice to hers for the moment\nand carry on her very note and air. It was the silent man's real and\nonly means of expression, and one could have listened forever, and have\nasked for more and more songs of old Scotch and English inheritance and\nthe best that have lived from the ballad music of the war. Mrs. Todd\nkept time visibly, and sometimes audibly, with her ample foot. I saw the\ntears in her eyes sometimes, when I could see beyond the tears in mine.\nBut at last the songs ended and the time came to say good-by; it was the\nend of a great pleasure.\n\nMrs. Blackett, the dear old lady, opened the door of her bedroom while\nMrs. Todd was tying up the herb bag, and William had gone down to get\nthe boat ready and to blow the horn for Johnny Bowden, who had joined a\nroving boat party who were off the shore lobstering.\n\nI went to the door of the bedroom, and thought how pleasant it looked,\nwith its pink-and-white patchwork quilt and the brown unpainted paneling\nof its woodwork.\n\n“Come right in, dear,” she said. “I want you to set down in my old\nquilted rockin'-chair there by the window; you'll say it's the prettiest\nview in the house. I set there a good deal to rest me and when I want to\nread.”\n\nThere was a worn red Bible on the lightstand, and Mrs. Blackett's heavy\nsilver-bowed glasses; her thimble was on the narrow window-ledge, and\nfolded carefully on the table was a thick striped-cotton shirt that\nshe was making for her son. Those dear old fingers and their loving\nstitches, that heart which had made the most of everything that needed\nlove! Here was the real home, the heart of the old house on Green\nIsland! I sat in the rocking-chair, and felt that it was a place of\npeace, the little brown bedroom, and the quiet outlook upon field and\nsea and sky.\n\nI looked up, and we understood each other without speaking. “I shall\nlike to think o' your settin' here to-day,” said Mrs. Blackett. “I want\nyou to come again. It has been so pleasant for William.”\n\nThe wind served us all the way home, and did not fall or let the sail\nslacken until we were close to the shore. We had a generous freight of\nlobsters in the boat, and new potatoes which William had put aboard, and\nwhat Mrs. Todd proudly called a full “kag” of prime number one salted\nmackerel; and when we landed we had to make business arrangements to\nhave these conveyed to her house in a wheelbarrow.\n\nI never shall forget the day at Green Island. The town of Dunnet Landing\nseemed large and noisy and oppressive as we came ashore. Such is the\npower of contrast; for the village was so still that I could hear the\nshy whippoorwills singing that night as I lay awake in my downstairs\nbedroom, and the scent of Mrs. Todd's herb garden under the window blew\nin again and again with every gentle rising of the seabreeze.\n\n\n\n\nXII. A Strange Sail\n\nEXCEPT FOR a few stray guests, islanders or from the inland country, to\nwhom Mrs. Todd offered the hospitalities of a single meal, we were quite\nby ourselves all summer; and when there were signs of invasion, late in\nJuly, and a certain Mrs. Fosdick appeared like a strange sail on the\nfar horizon, I suffered much from apprehension. I had been living in the\nquaint little house with as much comfort and unconsciousness as if it\nwere a larger body, or a double shell, in whose simple convolutions Mrs.\nTodd and I had secreted ourselves, until some wandering hermit crab of a\nvisitor marked the little spare room for her own. Perhaps now and then a\ncastaway on a lonely desert island dreads the thought of being rescued.\nI heard of Mrs. Fosdick for the first time with a selfish sense\nof objection; but after all, I was still vacation-tenant of the\nschoolhouse, where I could always be alone, and it was impossible not to\nsympathize with Mrs. Todd, who, in spite of some preliminary grumbling,\nwas really delighted with the prospect of entertaining an old friend.\n\nFor nearly a month we received occasional news of Mrs. Fosdick, who\nseemed to be making a royal progress from house to house in the inland\nneighborhood, after the fashion of Queen Elizabeth. One Sunday after\nanother came and went, disappointing Mrs. Todd in the hope of seeing\nher guest at church and fixing the day for the great visit to begin; but\nMrs. Fosdick was not ready to commit herself to a date. An assurance of\n“some time this week” was not sufficiently definite from a free-footed\nhousekeeper's point of view, and Mrs. Todd put aside all herb-gathering\nplans, and went through the various stages of expectation, provocation,\nand despair. At last she was ready to believe that Mrs. Fosdick must\nhave forgotten her promise and returned to her home, which was vaguely\nsaid to be over Thomaston way. But one evening, just as the supper-table\nwas cleared and “readied up,” and Mrs. Todd had put her large apron\nover her head and stepped forth for an evening stroll in the garden, the\nunexpected happened. She heard the sound of wheels, and gave an excited\ncry to me, as I sat by the window, that Mrs. Fosdick was coming right up\nthe street.\n\n“She may not be considerate, but she's dreadful good company,” said Mrs.\nTodd hastily, coming back a few steps from the neighborhood of the gate.\n“No, she ain't a mite considerate, but there's a small lobster left over\nfrom your tea; yes, it's a real mercy there's a lobster. Susan Fosdick\nmight just as well have passed the compliment o' comin' an hour ago.”\n\n“Perhaps she has had her supper,” I ventured to suggest, sharing the\nhousekeeper's anxiety, and meekly conscious of an inconsiderate appetite\nfor my own supper after a long expedition up the bay. There were so\nfew emergencies of any sort at Dunnet Landing that this one appeared\noverwhelming.\n\n“No, she's rode 'way over from Nahum Brayton's place. I expect they were\nbusy on the farm, and couldn't spare the horse in proper season. You\njust sly out an' set the teakittle on again, dear, an' drop in a good\nhan'ful o' chips; the fire's all alive. I'll take her right up to lay\noff her things, as she'll be occupied with explanations an' gettin' her\nbunnit off, so you'll have plenty o' time. She's one I shouldn't like to\nhave find me unprepared.”\n\nMrs. Fosdick was already at the gate, and Mrs. Todd now turned with an\nair of complete surprise and delight to welcome her.\n\n“Why, Susan Fosdick,” I heard her exclaim in a fine unhindered voice, as\nif she were calling across a field, “I come near giving of you up! I was\nafraid you'd gone an' 'portioned out my visit to somebody else. I s'pose\nyou've been to supper?”\n\n“Lor', no, I ain't, Almiry Todd,” said Mrs. Fosdick cheerfully, as she\nturned, laden with bags and bundles, from making her adieux to the boy\ndriver. “I ain't had a mite o' supper, dear. I've been lottin' all the\nway on a cup o' that best tea o' yourn,--some o' that Oolong you keep in\nthe little chist. I don't want none o' your useful herbs.”\n\n“I keep that tea for ministers' folks,” gayly responded Mrs. Todd.\n“Come right along in, Susan Fosdick. I declare if you ain't the same old\nsixpence!”\n\nAs they came up the walk together, laughing like girls, I fled, full\nof cares, to the kitchen, to brighten the fire and be sure that the\nlobster, sole dependence of a late supper, was well out of reach of the\ncat. There proved to be fine reserves of wild raspberries and bread and\nbutter, so that I regained my composure, and waited impatiently for my\nown share of this illustrious visit to begin. There was an instant sense\nof high festivity in the evening air from the moment when our guest had\nso frankly demanded the Oolong tea.\n\nThe great moment arrived. I was formally presented at the stair-foot,\nand the two friends passed on to the kitchen, where I soon heard a\nhospitable clink of crockery and the brisk stirring of a tea-cup. I sat\nin my high-backed rocking-chair by the window in the front room with an\nunreasonable feeling of being left out, like the child who stood at\nthe gate in Hans Andersen's story. Mrs. Fosdick did not look, at first\nsight, like a person of great social gifts. She was a serious-looking\nlittle bit of an old woman, with a birdlike nod of the head. I had often\nbeen told that she was the “best hand in the world to make a visit,”--as\nif to visit were the highest of vocations; that everybody wished\nfor her, while few could get her; and I saw that Mrs. Todd felt a\ncomfortable sense of distinction in being favored with the company of\nthis eminent person who “knew just how.” It was certainly true that Mrs.\nFosdick gave both her hostess and me a warm feeling of enjoyment\nand expectation, as if she had the power of social suggestion to all\nneighboring minds.\n\nThe two friends did not reappear for at least an hour. I could hear\ntheir busy voices, loud and low by turns, as they ranged from public\nto confidential topics. At last Mrs. Todd kindly remembered me and\nreturned, giving my door a ceremonious knock before she stepped in,\nwith the small visitor in her wake. She reached behind her and took Mrs.\nFosdick's hand as if she were young and bashful, and gave her a gentle\npull forward.\n\n“There, I don't know whether you're goin' to take to each other or\nnot; no, nobody can't tell whether you'll suit each other, but I\nexpect you'll get along some way, both having seen the world,” said\nour affectionate hostess. “You can inform Mis' Fosdick how we found\nthe folks out to Green Island the other day. She's always been well\nacquainted with mother. I'll slip out now an' put away the supper things\nan' set my bread to rise, if you'll both excuse me. You can come an'\nkeep me company when you get ready, either or both.” And Mrs. Todd,\nlarge and amiable, disappeared and left us.\n\nBeing furnished not only with a subject of conversation, but with a safe\nrefuge in the kitchen in case of incompatibility, Mrs. Fosdick and I sat\ndown, prepared to make the best of each other. I soon discovered that\nshe, like many of the elder women of the coast, had spent a part of\nher life at sea, and was full of a good traveler's curiosity and\nenlightenment. By the time we thought it discreet to join our hostess we\nwere already sincere friends.\n\nYou may speak of a visit's setting in as well as a tide's, and it was\nimpossible, as Mrs. Todd whispered to me, not to be pleased at the way\nthis visit was setting in; a new impulse and refreshing of the social\ncurrents and seldom visited bays of memory appeared to have begun.\nMrs. Fosdick had been the mother of a large family of sons and\ndaughters,--sailors and sailors' wives,--and most of them had died\nbefore her. I soon grew more or less acquainted with the histories of\nall their fortunes and misfortunes, and subjects of an intimate nature\nwere no more withheld from my ears than if I had been a shell on\nthe mantelpiece. Mrs. Fosdick was not without a touch of dignity and\nelegance; she was fashionable in her dress, but it was a curiously\nwell-preserved provincial fashion of some years back. In a wider sphere\none might have called her a woman of the world, with her unexpected bits\nof modern knowledge, but Mrs. Todd's wisdom was an intimation of truth\nitself. She might belong to any age, like an idyl of Theocritus; but\nwhile she always understood Mrs. Fosdick, that entertaining pilgrim\ncould not always understand Mrs. Todd.\n\nThat very first evening my friends plunged into a borderless sea of\nreminiscences and personal news. Mrs. Fosdick had been staying with a\nfamily who owned the farm where she was born, and she had visited every\nsunny knoll and shady field corner; but when she said that it might be\nfor the last time, I detected in her tone something expectant of the\ncontradiction which Mrs. Todd promptly offered.\n\n“Almiry,” said Mrs. Fosdick, with sadness, “you may say what you like,\nbut I am one of nine brothers and sisters brought up on the old place,\nand we're all dead but me.”\n\n“Your sister Dailey ain't gone, is she? Why, no, Louisa ain't gone!”\n exclaimed Mrs. Todd, with surprise. “Why, I never heard of that\noccurrence!”\n\n“Yes'm; she passed away last October, in Lynn. She had made her distant\nhome in Vermont State, but she was making a visit to her youngest\ndaughter. Louisa was the only one of my family whose funeral I wasn't\nable to attend, but 'twas a mere accident. All the rest of us were\nsettled right about home. I thought it was very slack of 'em in Lynn\nnot to fetch her to the old place; but when I came to hear about it,\nI learned that they'd recently put up a very elegant monument, and my\nsister Dailey was always great for show. She'd just been out to see the\nmonument the week before she was taken down, and admired it so much that\nthey felt sure of her wishes.”\n\n“So she's really gone, and the funeral was up to Lynn!” repeated Mrs.\nTodd, as if to impress the sad fact upon her mind. “She was some years\nyounger than we be, too. I recollect the first day she ever came to\nschool; 'twas that first year mother sent me inshore to stay with aunt\nTopham's folks and get my schooling. You fetched little Louisa to school\none Monday mornin' in a pink dress an' her long curls, and she set\nbetween you an' me, and got cryin' after a while, so the teacher sent us\nhome with her at recess.”\n\n“She was scared of seeing so many children about her; there was only her\nand me and brother John at home then; the older boys were to sea with\nfather, an' the rest of us wa'n't born,” explained Mrs. Fosdick. “That\nnext fall we all went to sea together. Mother was uncertain till the\nlast minute, as one may say. The ship was waiting orders, but the baby\nthat then was, was born just in time, and there was a long spell of\nextra bad weather, so mother got about again before they had to sail,\nan' we all went. I remember my clothes were all left ashore in the east\nchamber in a basket where mother'd took them out o' my chist o' drawers\nan' left 'em ready to carry aboard. She didn't have nothing aboard, of\nher own, that she wanted to cut up for me, so when my dress wore out she\njust put me into a spare suit o' John's, jacket and trousers. I wasn't\nbut eight years old an' he was most seven and large of his age. Quick\nas we made a port she went right ashore an' fitted me out pretty, but\nwe was bound for the East Indies and didn't put in anywhere for a good\nwhile. So I had quite a spell o' freedom. Mother made my new skirt\nlong because I was growing, and I poked about the deck after that, real\ndiscouraged, feeling the hem at my heels every minute, and as if youth\nwas past and gone. I liked the trousers best; I used to climb the\nriggin' with 'em and frighten mother till she said an' vowed she'd never\ntake me to sea again.”\n\nI thought by the polite absent-minded smile on Mrs. Todd's face this was\nno new story.\n\n“Little Louisa was a beautiful child; yes, I always thought Louisa was\nvery pretty,” Mrs. Todd said. “She was a dear little girl in those\ndays. She favored your mother; the rest of you took after your father's\nfolks.”\n\n“We did certain,” agreed Mrs. Fosdick, rocking steadily. “There, it does\nseem so pleasant to talk with an old acquaintance that knows what you\nknow. I see so many of these new folks nowadays, that seem to have\nneither past nor future. Conversation's got to have some root in the\npast, or else you've got to explain every remark you make, an' it wears\na person out.”\n\nMrs. Todd gave a funny little laugh. “Yes'm, old friends is always best,\n'less you can catch a new one that's fit to make an old one out of,”\n she said, and we gave an affectionate glance at each other which Mrs.\nFosdick could not have understood, being the latest comer to the house.\n\n\n\n\nXIII. Poor Joanna\n\nONE EVENING my ears caught a mysterious allusion which Mrs. Todd made to\nShell-heap Island. It was a chilly night of cold northeasterly rain, and\nI made a fire for the first time in the Franklin stove in my room, and\nbegged my two housemates to come in and keep me company. The weather had\nconvinced Mrs. Todd that it was time to make a supply of cough-drops,\nand she had been bringing forth herbs from dark and dry hiding-places,\nuntil now the pungent dust and odor of them had resolved themselves into\none mighty flavor of spearmint that came from a simmering caldron\nof syrup in the kitchen. She called it done, and well done, and had\nostentatiously left it to cool, and taken her knitting-work because\nMrs. Fosdick was busy with hers. They sat in the two rocking-chairs, the\nsmall woman and the large one, but now and then I could see that Mrs.\nTodd's thoughts remained with the cough-drops. The time of gathering\nherbs was nearly over, but the time of syrups and cordials had begun.\n\nThe heat of the open fire made us a little drowsy, but something in the\nway Mrs. Todd spoke of Shell-heap Island waked my interest. I waited to\nsee if she would say any more, and then took a roundabout way back to\nthe subject by saying what was first in my mind: that I wished the Green\nIsland family were there to spend the evening with us,--Mrs. Todd's\nmother and her brother William.\n\nMrs. Todd smiled, and drummed on the arm of the rocking-chair. “Might\nscare William to death,” she warned me; and Mrs. Fosdick mentioned her\nintention of going out to Green Island to stay two or three days, if the\nwind didn't make too much sea.\n\n“Where is Shell-heap Island?” I ventured to ask, seizing the\nopportunity.\n\n“Bears nor-east somewheres about three miles from Green Island; right\noff-shore, I should call it about eight miles out,” said Mrs. Todd. “You\nnever was there, dear; 'tis off the thoroughfares, and a very bad place\nto land at best.”\n\n“I should think 'twas,” agreed Mrs. Fosdick, smoothing down her black\nsilk apron. “'Tis a place worth visitin' when you once get there. Some\no' the old folks was kind o' fearful about it. 'Twas 'counted a great\nplace in old Indian times; you can pick up their stone tools 'most any\ntime if you hunt about. There's a beautiful spring o' water, too. Yes,\nI remember when they used to tell queer stories about Shell-heap Island.\nSome said 'twas a great bangeing-place for the Indians, and an old chief\nresided there once that ruled the winds; and others said they'd always\nheard that once the Indians come down from up country an' left a captive\nthere without any bo't, an' 'twas too far to swim across to Black\nIsland, so called, an' he lived there till he perished.”\n\n“I've heard say he walked the island after that, and sharp-sighted folks\ncould see him an' lose him like one o' them citizens Cap'n Littlepage\nwas acquainted with up to the north pole,” announced Mrs. Todd grimly.\n“Anyway, there was Indians--you can see their shell-heap that named the\nisland; and I've heard myself that 'twas one o' their cannibal places,\nbut I never could believe it. There never was no cannibals on the coast\no' Maine. All the Indians o' these regions are tame-looking folks.”\n\n“Sakes alive, yes!” exclaimed Mrs. Fosdick. “Ought to see them painted\nsavages I've seen when I was young out in the South Sea Islands! That\nwas the time for folks to travel, 'way back in the old whalin' days!”\n\n“Whalin' must have been dull for a lady, hardly ever makin' a lively\nport, and not takin' in any mixed cargoes,” said Mrs. Todd. “I never\ndesired to go a whalin' v'y'ge myself.”\n\n“I used to return feelin' very slack an' behind the times, 'tis true,”\n explained Mrs. Fosdick, “but 'twas excitin', an' we always done extra\nwell, and felt rich when we did get ashore. I liked the variety. There,\nhow times have changed; how few seafarin' families there are left! What\na lot o' queer folks there used to be about here, anyway, when we was\nyoung, Almiry. Everybody's just like everybody else, now; nobody to\nlaugh about, and nobody to cry about.”\n\nIt seemed to me that there were peculiarities of character in the region\nof Dunnet Landing yet, but I did not like to interrupt.\n\n“Yes,” said Mrs. Todd after a moment of meditation, “there was certain\na good many curiosities of human natur' in this neighborhood years ago.\nThere was more energy then, and in some the energy took a singular turn.\nIn these days the young folks is all copy-cats, 'fraid to death they\nwon't be all just alike; as for the old folks, they pray for the\nadvantage o' bein' a little different.”\n\n“I ain't heard of a copy-cat this great many years,” said Mrs. Fosdick,\nlaughing; “'twas a favorite term o' my grandfather's. No, I wa'n't\nthinking o' those things, but of them strange straying creatur's that\nused to rove the country. You don't see them now, or the ones that used\nto hive away in their own houses with some strange notion or other.”\n\nI thought again of Captain Littlepage, but my companions were not\nreminded of his name; and there was brother William at Green Island,\nwhom we all three knew.\n\n“I was talking o' poor Joanna the other day. I hadn't thought of her for\na great while,” said Mrs. Fosdick abruptly. “Mis' Brayton an' I recalled\nher as we sat together sewing. She was one o' your peculiar persons,\nwa'n't she? Speaking of such persons,” she turned to explain to me,\n“there was a sort of a nun or hermit person lived out there for years\nall alone on Shell-heap Island. Miss Joanna Todd, her name was,--a\ncousin o' Almiry's late husband.”\n\nI expressed my interest, but as I glanced at Mrs. Todd I saw that she\nwas confused by sudden affectionate feeling and unmistakable desire for\nreticence.\n\n“I never want to hear Joanna laughed about,” she said anxiously.\n\n“Nor I,” answered Mrs. Fosdick reassuringly. “She was crossed in\nlove,--that was all the matter to begin with; but as I look back, I can\nsee that Joanna was one doomed from the first to fall into a melancholy.\nShe retired from the world for good an' all, though she was a well-off\nwoman. All she wanted was to get away from folks; she thought she wasn't\nfit to live with anybody, and wanted to be free. Shell-heap Island come\nto her from her father, and first thing folks knew she'd gone off out\nthere to live, and left word she didn't want no company. 'Twas a bad\nplace to get to, unless the wind an' tide were just right; 'twas hard\nwork to make a landing.”\n\n“What time of year was this?” I asked.\n\n“Very late in the summer,” said Mrs. Fosdick. “No, I never could laugh\nat Joanna, as some did. She set everything by the young man, an' they\nwere going to marry in about a month, when he got bewitched with a girl\n'way up the bay, and married her, and went off to Massachusetts. He\nwasn't well thought of,--there were those who thought Joanna's money\nwas what had tempted him; but she'd given him her whole heart, an' she\nwa'n't so young as she had been. All her hopes were built on marryin',\nan' havin' a real home and somebody to look to; she acted just like a\nbird when its nest is spoilt. The day after she heard the news she was\nin dreadful woe, but the next she came to herself very quiet, and took\nthe horse and wagon, and drove fourteen miles to the lawyer's, and\nsigned a paper givin' her half of the farm to her brother. They never\nhad got along very well together, but he didn't want to sign it, till\nshe acted so distressed that he gave in. Edward Todd's wife was a good\nwoman, who felt very bad indeed, and used every argument with Joanna;\nbut Joanna took a poor old boat that had been her father's and lo'ded in\na few things, and off she put all alone, with a good land breeze, right\nout to sea. Edward Todd ran down to the beach, an' stood there cryin'\nlike a boy to see her go, but she was out o' hearin'. She never stepped\nfoot on the mainland again long as she lived.”\n\n“How large an island is it? How did she manage in winter?” I asked.\n\n“Perhaps thirty acres, rocks and all,” answered Mrs. Todd, taking up the\nstory gravely. “There can't be much of it that the salt spray don't fly\nover in storms. No, 'tis a dreadful small place to make a world of;\nit has a different look from any of the other islands, but there's a\nsheltered cove on the south side, with mud-flats across one end of it\nat low water where there's excellent clams, and the big shell-heap keeps\nsome o' the wind off a little house her father took the trouble to build\nwhen he was a young man. They said there was an old house built o' logs\nthere before that, with a kind of natural cellar in the rock under it.\nHe used to stay out there days to a time, and anchor a little sloop he\nhad, and dig clams to fill it, and sail up to Portland. They said the\ndealers always gave him an extra price, the clams were so noted. Joanna\nused to go out and stay with him. They were always great companions, so\nshe knew just what 'twas out there. There was a few sheep that belonged\nto her brother an' her, but she bargained for him to come and get them\non the edge o' cold weather. Yes, she desired him to come for the sheep;\nan' his wife thought perhaps Joanna'd return, but he said no, an' lo'ded\nthe bo't with warm things an' what he thought she'd need through the\nwinter. He come home with the sheep an' left the other things by the\nhouse, but she never so much as looked out o' the window. She done it\nfor a penance. She must have wanted to see Edward by that time.”\n\nMrs. Fosdick was fidgeting with eagerness to speak.\n\n“Some thought the first cold snap would set her ashore, but she always\nremained,” concluded Mrs. Todd soberly.\n\n“Talk about the men not having any curiosity!” exclaimed Mrs. Fosdick\nscornfully. “Why, the waters round Shell-heap Island were white with\nsails all that fall. 'Twas never called no great of a fishin'-ground\nbefore. Many of 'em made excuse to go ashore to get water at the spring;\nbut at last she spoke to a bo't-load, very dignified and calm, and said\nthat she'd like it better if they'd make a practice of getting water to\nBlack Island or somewheres else and leave her alone, except in case of\naccident or trouble. But there was one man who had always set everything\nby her from a boy. He'd have married her if the other hadn't come about\nan' spoilt his chance, and he used to get close to the island, before\nlight, on his way out fishin', and throw a little bundle way up the\ngreen slope front o' the house. His sister told me she happened to see,\nthe first time, what a pretty choice he made o' useful things that a\nwoman would feel lost without. He stood off fishin', and could see them\nin the grass all day, though sometimes she'd come out and walk right\nby them. There was other bo'ts near, out after mackerel. But early next\nmorning his present was gone. He didn't presume too much, but once he\ntook her a nice firkin o' things he got up to Portland, and when spring\ncome he landed her a hen and chickens in a nice little coop. There was a\ngood many old friends had Joanna on their minds.”\n\n“Yes,” said Mrs. Todd, losing her sad reserve in the growing sympathy\nof these reminiscences. “How everybody used to notice whether there\nwas smoke out of the chimney! The Black Island folks could see her with\ntheir spy-glass, and if they'd ever missed getting some sign o' life\nthey'd have sent notice to her folks. But after the first year or two\nJoanna was more and more forgotten as an every-day charge. Folks lived\nvery simple in those days, you know,” she continued, as Mrs. Fosdick's\nknitting was taking much thought at the moment. “I expect there was\nalways plenty of driftwood thrown up, and a poor failin' patch of\nspruces covered all the north side of the island, so she always had\nsomething to burn. She was very fond of workin' in the garden ashore,\nand that first summer she began to till the little field out there, and\nraised a nice parcel o' potatoes. She could fish, o' course, and there\nwas all her clams an' lobsters. You can always live well in any wild\nplace by the sea when you'd starve to death up country, except 'twas\nberry time. Joanna had berries out there, blackberries at least,\nand there was a few herbs in case she needed them. Mullein in great\nquantities and a plant o' wormwood I remember seeing once when I\nstayed there, long before she fled out to Shell-heap. Yes, I recall the\nwormwood, which is always a planted herb, so there must have been folks\nthere before the Todds' day. A growin' bush makes the best gravestone;\nI expect that wormwood always stood for somebody's solemn monument.\nCatnip, too, is a very endurin' herb about an old place.”\n\n“But what I want to know is what she did for other things,” interrupted\nMrs. Fosdick. “Almiry, what did she do for clothin' when she needed to\nreplenish, or risin' for her bread, or the piece-bag that no woman can\nlive long without?”\n\n“Or company,” suggested Mrs. Todd. “Joanna was one that loved her\nfriends. There must have been a terrible sight o' long winter evenin's\nthat first year.”\n\n“There was her hens,” suggested Mrs. Fosdick, after reviewing the\nmelancholy situation. “She never wanted the sheep after that first\nseason. There wa'n't no proper pasture for sheep after the June grass\nwas past, and she ascertained the fact and couldn't bear to see them\nsuffer; but the chickens done well. I remember sailin' by one spring\nafternoon, an' seein' the coops out front o' the house in the sun. How\nlong was it before you went out with the minister? You were the first\nones that ever really got ashore to see Joanna.”\n\nI had been reflecting upon a state of society which admitted such\npersonal freedom and a voluntary hermitage. There was something\nmediaeval in the behavior of poor Joanna Todd under a disappointment of\nthe heart. The two women had drawn closer together, and were talking on,\nquite unconscious of a listener.\n\n“Poor Joanna!” said Mrs. Todd again, and sadly shook her head as if\nthere were things one could not speak about.\n\n“I called her a great fool,” declared Mrs. Fosdick, with spirit, “but I\npitied her then, and I pity her far more now. Some other minister would\nhave been a great help to her,--one that preached self-forgetfulness and\ndoin' for others to cure our own ills; but Parson Dimmick was a vague\nperson, well meanin', but very numb in his feelin's. I don't suppose at\nthat troubled time Joanna could think of any way to mend her troubles\nexcept to run off and hide.”\n\n“Mother used to say she didn't see how Joanna lived without having\nnobody to do for, getting her own meals and tending her own poor self\nday in an' day out,” said Mrs. Todd sorrowfully.\n\n“There was the hens,” repeated Mrs. Fosdick kindly. “I expect she soon\ncame to makin' folks o' them. No, I never went to work to blame Joanna,\nas some did. She was full o' feeling, and her troubles hurt her more\nthan she could bear. I see it all now as I couldn't when I was young.”\n\n“I suppose in old times they had their shut-up convents for just such\nfolks,” said Mrs. Todd, as if she and her friend had disagreed about\nJoanna once, and were now in happy harmony. She seemed to speak with new\nopenness and freedom. “Oh yes, I was only too pleased when the Reverend\nMr. Dimmick invited me to go out with him. He hadn't been very long in\nthe place when Joanna left home and friends. 'Twas one day that next\nsummer after she went, and I had been married early in the spring. He\nfelt that he ought to go out and visit her. She was a member of the\nchurch, and might wish to have him consider her spiritual state. I\nwa'n't so sure o' that, but I always liked Joanna, and I'd come to be\nher cousin by marriage. Nathan an' I had conversed about goin' out to\npay her a visit, but he got his chance to sail sooner'n he expected. He\nalways thought everything of her, and last time he come home, knowing\nnothing of her change, he brought her a beautiful coral pin from a port\nhe'd touched at somewheres up the Mediterranean. So I wrapped the little\nbox in a nice piece of paper and put it in my pocket, and picked her a\nbunch of fresh lemon balm, and off we started.”\n\nMrs. Fosdick laughed. “I remember hearin' about your trials on the\nv'y'ge,” she said.\n\n“Why, yes,” continued Mrs. Todd in her company manner. “I picked her the\nbalm, an' we started. Why, yes, Susan, the minister liked to have cost\nme my life that day. He would fasten the sheet, though I advised against\nit. He said the rope was rough an' cut his hand. There was a fresh\nbreeze, an' he went on talking rather high flown, an' I felt some\ninterested. All of a sudden there come up a gust, and he gave a screech\nand stood right up and called for help, 'way out there to sea. I knocked\nhim right over into the bottom o' the bo't, getting by to catch hold of\nthe sheet an' untie it. He wasn't but a little man; I helped him right\nup after the squall passed, and made a handsome apology to him, but he\ndid act kind o' offended.”\n\n“I do think they ought not to settle them landlocked folks in parishes\nwhere they're liable to be on the water,” insisted Mrs. Fosdick. “Think\nof the families in our parish that was scattered all about the bay, and\nwhat a sight o' sails you used to see, in Mr. Dimmick's day, standing\nacross to the mainland on a pleasant Sunday morning, filled with\nchurch-going folks, all sure to want him some time or other! You\ncouldn't find no doctor that would stand up in the boat and screech if a\nflaw struck her.”\n\n“Old Dr. Bennett had a beautiful sailboat, didn't he?” responded Mrs.\nTodd. “And how well he used to brave the weather! Mother always said\nthat in time o' trouble that tall white sail used to look like an\nangel's wing comin' over the sea to them that was in pain. Well, there's\na difference in gifts. Mr. Dimmick was not without light.”\n\n“'Twas light o' the moon, then,” snapped Mrs. Fosdick; “he was pompous\nenough, but I never could remember a single word he said. There, go on,\nMis' Todd; I forget a great deal about that day you went to see poor\nJoanna.”\n\n“I felt she saw us coming, and knew us a great way off; yes, I seemed to\nfeel it within me,” said our friend, laying down her knitting. “I kept\nmy seat, and took the bo't inshore without saying a word; there was a\nshort channel that I was sure Mr. Dimmick wasn't acquainted with, and\nthe tide was very low. She never came out to warn us off nor anything,\nand I thought, as I hauled the bo't up on a wave and let the Reverend\nMr. Dimmick step out, that it was somethin' gained to be safe ashore.\nThere was a little smoke out o' the chimney o' Joanna's house, and it\ndid look sort of homelike and pleasant with wild mornin'-glory vines\ntrained up; an' there was a plot o' flowers under the front window,\nportulacas and things. I believe she'd made a garden once, when she was\nstopping there with her father, and some things must have seeded in. It\nlooked as if she might have gone over to the other side of the island.\n'Twas neat and pretty all about the house, and a lovely day in July.\nWe walked up from the beach together very sedate, and I felt for poor\nNathan's little pin to see if 'twas safe in my dress pocket. All of a\nsudden Joanna come right to the fore door and stood there, not sayin' a\nword.”\n\n\n\n\nXIV. The Hermitage\n\nMY COMPANION and I had been so intent upon the subject of the\nconversation that we had not heard any one open the gate, but at this\nmoment, above the noise of the rain, we heard a loud knocking. We were\nall startled as we sat by the fire, and Mrs. Todd rose hastily and went\nto answer the call, leaving her rocking-chair in violent motion. Mrs.\nFosdick and I heard an anxious voice at the door speaking of a sick\nchild, and Mrs. Todd's kind, motherly voice inviting the messenger in:\nthen we waited in silence. There was a sound of heavy dropping of\nrain from the eaves, and the distant roar and undertone of the sea.\nMy thoughts flew back to the lonely woman on her outer island; what\nseparation from humankind she must have felt, what terror and sadness,\neven in a summer storm like this!\n\n“You send right after the doctor if she ain't better in half an hour,”\n said Mrs. Todd to her worried customer as they parted; and I felt a\nwarm sense of comfort in the evident resources of even so small a\nneighborhood, but for the poor hermit Joanna there was no neighbor on a\nwinter night.\n\n\n“How did she look?” demanded Mrs. Fosdick, without preface, as our large\nhostess returned to the little room with a mist about her from standing\nlong in the wet doorway, and the sudden draught of her coming beat out\nthe smoke and flame from the Franklin stove. “How did poor Joanna look?”\n\n“She was the same as ever, except I thought she looked smaller,”\n answered Mrs. Todd after thinking a moment; perhaps it was only a last\nconsidering thought about her patient. “Yes, she was just the same, and\nlooked very nice, Joanna did. I had been married since she left home,\nan' she treated me like her own folks. I expected she'd look strange,\nwith her hair turned gray in a night or somethin', but she wore a pretty\ngingham dress I'd often seen her wear before she went away; she must\nhave kept it nice for best in the afternoons. She always had beautiful,\nquiet manners. I remember she waited till we were close to her, and then\nkissed me real affectionate, and inquired for Nathan before she shook\nhands with the minister, and then she invited us both in. 'Twas the same\nlittle house her father had built him when he was a bachelor, with one\nlivin'-room, and a little mite of a bedroom out of it where she slept,\nbut 'twas neat as a ship's cabin. There was some old chairs, an' a seat\nmade of a long box that might have held boat tackle an' things to lock\nup in his fishin' days, and a good enough stove so anybody could cook\nand keep warm in cold weather. I went over once from home and stayed\n'most a week with Joanna when we was girls, and those young happy days\nrose up before me. Her father was busy all day fishin' or clammin'; he\nwas one o' the pleasantest men in the world, but Joanna's mother had the\ngrim streak, and never knew what 'twas to be happy. The first minute my\neyes fell upon Joanna's face that day I saw how she had grown to look\nlike Mis' Todd. 'Twas the mother right over again.”\n\n“Oh dear me!” said Mrs. Fosdick.\n\n“Joanna had done one thing very pretty. There was a little piece o'\nswamp on the island where good rushes grew plenty, and she'd gathered\n'em, and braided some beautiful mats for the floor and a thick cushion\nfor the long bunk. She'd showed a good deal of invention; you see\nthere was a nice chance to pick up pieces o' wood and boards that drove\nashore, and she'd made good use o' what she found. There wasn't no\nclock, but she had a few dishes on a shelf, and flowers set about in\nshells fixed to the walls, so it did look sort of homelike, though so\nlonely and poor. I couldn't keep the tears out o' my eyes, I felt so\nsad. I said to myself, I must get mother to come over an' see Joanna;\nthe love in mother's heart would warm her, an' she might be able to\nadvise.”\n\n“Oh no, Joanna was dreadful stern,” said Mrs. Fosdick.\n\n“We were all settin' down very proper, but Joanna would keep stealin'\nglances at me as if she was glad I come. She had but little to say; she\nwas real polite an' gentle, and yet forbiddin'. The minister found it\nhard,” confessed Mrs. Todd; “he got embarrassed, an' when he put on his\nauthority and asked her if she felt to enjoy religion in her present\nsituation, an' she replied that she must be excused from answerin', I\nthought I should fly. She might have made it easier for him; after all,\nhe was the minister and had taken some trouble to come out, though 'twas\nkind of cold an' unfeelin' the way he inquired. I thought he might have\nseen the little old Bible a-layin' on the shelf close by him, an' I\nwished he knew enough to just lay his hand on it an' read somethin'\nkind an' fatherly 'stead of accusin' her, an' then given poor Joanna his\nblessin' with the hope she might be led to comfort. He did offer prayer,\nbut 'twas all about hearin' the voice o' God out o' the whirlwind; and I\nthought while he was goin' on that anybody that had spent the long cold\nwinter all alone out on Shell-heap Island knew a good deal more about\nthose things than he did. I got so provoked I opened my eyes and stared\nright at him.\n\n“She didn't take no notice, she kep' a nice respectful manner towards\nhim, and when there come a pause she asked if he had any interest\nabout the old Indian remains, and took down some queer stone gouges and\nhammers off of one of her shelves and showed them to him same's if\nhe was a boy. He remarked that he'd like to walk over an' see the\nshell-heap; so she went right to the door and pointed him the way. I\nsee then that she'd made her some kind o' sandal-shoes out o' the fine\nrushes to wear on her feet; she stepped light an' nice in 'em as shoes.”\n\nMrs. Fosdick leaned back in her rocking-chair and gave a heavy sigh.\n\n“I didn't move at first, but I'd held out just as long as I could,” said\nMrs. Todd, whose voice trembled a little. “When Joanna returned from the\ndoor, an' I could see that man's stupid back departin' among the wild\nrose bushes, I just ran to her an' caught her in my arms. I wasn't so\nbig as I be now, and she was older than me, but I hugged her tight, just\nas if she was a child. 'Oh, Joanna dear,' I says, 'won't you come ashore\nan' live 'long o' me at the Landin', or go over to Green Island to\nmother's when winter comes? Nobody shall trouble you an' mother finds it\nhard bein' alone. I can't bear to leave you here'--and I burst right out\ncrying. I'd had my own trials, young as I was, an' she knew it. Oh, I\ndid entreat her; yes, I entreated Joanna.”\n\n“What did she say then?” asked Mrs. Fosdick, much moved.\n\n“She looked the same way, sad an' remote through it all,” said Mrs. Todd\nmournfully. “She took hold of my hand, and we sat down close together;\n'twas as if she turned round an' made a child of me. 'I haven't got\nno right to live with folks no more,' she said. 'You must never ask me\nagain, Almiry: I've done the only thing I could do, and I've made my\nchoice. I feel a great comfort in your kindness, but I don't deserve it.\nI have committed the unpardonable sin; you don't understand,' says she\nhumbly. 'I was in great wrath and trouble, and my thoughts was so wicked\ntowards God that I can't expect ever to be forgiven. I have come to\nknow what it is to have patience, but I have lost my hope. You must tell\nthose that ask how 'tis with me,' she said, 'an' tell them I want to\nbe alone.' I couldn't speak; no, there wa'n't anything I could say, she\nseemed so above everything common. I was a good deal younger then than I\nbe now, and I got Nathan's little coral pin out o' my pocket and put it\ninto her hand; and when she saw it and I told her where it come from,\nher face did really light up for a minute, sort of bright an' pleasant.\n'Nathan an' I was always good friends; I'm glad he don't think hard of\nme,' says she. 'I want you to have it, Almiry, an' wear it for love\no' both o' us,' and she handed it back to me. 'You give my love to\nNathan,--he's a dear good man,' she said; 'an' tell your mother, if I\nshould be sick she mustn't wish I could get well, but I want her to be\nthe one to come.' Then she seemed to have said all she wanted to, as\nif she was done with the world, and we sat there a few minutes longer\ntogether. It was real sweet and quiet except for a good many birds and\nthe sea rollin' up on the beach; but at last she rose, an' I did too,\nand she kissed me and held my hand in hers a minute, as if to say\ngood-by; then she turned and went right away out o' the door and\ndisappeared.\n\n“The minister come back pretty soon, and I told him I was all ready,\nand we started down to the bo't. He had picked up some round stones and\nthings and was carrying them in his pocket-handkerchief; an' he sat down\namidships without making any question, and let me take the rudder an'\nwork the bo't, an' made no remarks for some time, until we sort of eased\nit off speaking of the weather, an' subjects that arose as we skirted\nBlack Island, where two or three families lived belongin' to the parish.\nHe preached next Sabbath as usual, somethin' high soundin' about the\ncreation, and I couldn't help thinkin' he might never get no further; he\nseemed to know no remedies, but he had a great use of words.”\n\nMrs. Fosdick sighed again. “Hearin' you tell about Joanna brings the\ntime right back as if 'twas yesterday,” she said. “Yes, she was one o'\nthem poor things that talked about the great sin; we don't seem to\nhear nothing about the unpardonable sin now, but you may say 'twas not\nuncommon then.”\n\n“I expect that if it had been in these days, such a person would be\nplagued to death with idle folks,” continued Mrs. Todd, after a long\npause. “As it was, nobody trespassed on her; all the folks about the\nbay respected her an' her feelings; but as time wore on, after you\nleft here, one after another ventured to make occasion to put somethin'\nashore for her if they went that way. I know mother used to go to see\nher sometimes, and send William over now and then with something fresh\nan' nice from the farm. There is a point on the sheltered side where you\ncan lay a boat close to shore an' land anything safe on the turf out o'\nreach o' the water. There were one or two others, old folks, that\nshe would see, and now an' then she'd hail a passin' boat an' ask for\nsomethin'; and mother got her to promise that she would make some sign\nto the Black Island folks if she wanted help. I never saw her myself to\nspeak to after that day.”\n\n“I expect nowadays, if such a thing happened, she'd have gone out West\nto her uncle's folks or up to Massachusetts and had a change, an' come\nhome good as new. The world's bigger an' freer than it used to be,”\n urged Mrs. Fosdick.\n\n“No,” said her friend. “'Tis like bad eyesight, the mind of such a\nperson: if your eyes don't see right there may be a remedy, but there's\nno kind of glasses to remedy the mind. No, Joanna was Joanna, and there\nshe lays on her island where she lived and did her poor penance. She\ntold mother the day she was dyin' that she always used to want to be\nfetched inshore when it come to the last; but she'd thought it over, and\ndesired to be laid on the island, if 'twas thought right. So the funeral\nwas out there, a Saturday afternoon in September. 'Twas a pretty day,\nand there wa'n't hardly a boat on the coast within twenty miles that\ndidn't head for Shell-heap cram-full o' folks an' all real respectful,\nsame's if she'd always stayed ashore and held her friends. Some went out\no' mere curiosity, I don't doubt,--there's always such to every funeral;\nbut most had real feelin', and went purpose to show it. She'd got most\no' the wild sparrows as tame as could be, livin' out there so long among\n'em, and one flew right in and lit on the coffin an' begun to sing\nwhile Mr. Dimmick was speakin'. He was put out by it, an' acted as if he\ndidn't know whether to stop or go on. I may have been prejudiced, but\nI wa'n't the only one thought the poor little bird done the best of the\ntwo.”\n\n“What became o' the man that treated her so, did you ever hear?” asked\nMrs. Fosdick. “I know he lived up to Massachusetts for a while. Somebody\nwho came from the same place told me that he was in trade there an'\ndoin' very well, but that was years ago.”\n\n“I never heard anything more than that; he went to the war in one o' the\nearly regiments. No, I never heard any more of him,” answered Mrs. Todd.\n“Joanna was another sort of person, and perhaps he showed good judgment\nin marryin' somebody else, if only he'd behaved straight-forward and\nmanly. He was a shifty-eyed, coaxin' sort of man, that got what he\nwanted out o' folks, an' only gave when he wanted to buy, made friends\neasy and lost 'em without knowin' the difference. She'd had a piece o'\nwork tryin' to make him walk accordin' to her right ideas, but she'd\nhave had too much variety ever to fall into a melancholy. Some is meant\nto be the Joannas in this world, an' 'twas her poor lot.”\n\n\n\n\nXV. On Shell-heap Island\n\nSOME TIME AFTER Mrs. Fosdick's visit was over and we had returned to\nour former quietness, I was out sailing alone with Captain Bowden in his\nlarge boat. We were taking the crooked northeasterly channel seaward,\nand were well out from shore while it was still early in the afternoon.\nI found myself presently among some unfamiliar islands, and suddenly\nremembered the story of poor Joanna. There is something in the fact of a\nhermitage that cannot fail to touch the imagination; the recluses are\na sad kindred, but they are never commonplace. Mrs. Todd had truly said\nthat Joanna was like one of the saints in the desert; the loneliness of\nsorrow will forever keep alive their sad succession.\n\n“Where is Shell-heap Island?” I asked eagerly.\n\n“You see Shell-heap now, layin' 'way out beyond Black Island there,”\n answered the captain, pointing with outstretched arm as he stood, and\nholding the rudder with his knee.\n\n“I should like very much to go there,” said I, and the captain, without\ncomment, changed his course a little more to the eastward and let the\nreef out of his mainsail.\n\n“I don't know's we can make an easy landin' for ye,” he remarked\ndoubtfully. “May get your feet wet; bad place to land. Trouble is I\nought to have brought a tag-boat; but they clutch on to the water so,\nan' I do love to sail free. This gre't boat gets easy bothered with\nanything trailin'. 'Tain't breakin' much on the meetin'-house ledges;\nguess I can fetch in to Shell-heap.”\n\n“How long is it since Miss Joanna Todd died?” I asked, partly by way of\nexplanation.\n\n“Twenty-two years come September,” answered the captain, after\nreflection. “She died the same year as my oldest boy was born, an' the\ntown house was burnt over to the Port. I didn't know but you merely\nwanted to hunt for some o' them Indian relics. Long's you want to see\nwhere Joanna lived--No, 'tain't breakin' over the ledges; we'll manage\nto fetch across the shoals somehow, 'tis such a distance to go 'way\nround, and tide's a-risin',” he ended hopefully, and we sailed steadily\non, the captain speechless with intent watching of a difficult course,\nuntil the small island with its low whitish promontory lay in full view\nbefore us under the bright afternoon sun.\n\nThe month was August, and I had seen the color of the islands change\nfrom the fresh green of June to a sunburnt brown that made them look\nlike stone, except where the dark green of the spruces and fir balsam\nkept the tint that even winter storms might deepen, but not fade. The\nfew wind-bent trees on Shell-heap Island were mostly dead and gray,\nbut there were some low-growing bushes, and a stripe of light green ran\nalong just above the shore, which I knew to be wild morning-glories. As\nwe came close I could see the high stone walls of a small square field,\nthough there were no sheep left to assail it; and below, there was a\nlittle harbor-like cove where Captain Bowden was boldly running the\ngreat boat in to seek a landing-place. There was a crooked channel of\ndeep water which led close up against the shore.\n\n“There, you hold fast for'ard there, an' wait for her to lift on the\nwave. You'll make a good landin' if you're smart; right on the port-hand\nside!” the captain called excitedly; and I, standing ready with high\nambition, seized my chance and leaped over to the grassy bank.\n\n“I'm beat if I ain't aground after all!” mourned the captain\ndespondently.\n\nBut I could reach the bowsprit, and he pushed with the boat-hook, while\nthe wind veered round a little as if on purpose and helped with the\nsail; so presently the boat was free and began to drift out from shore.\n\n“Used to call this p'int Joanna's wharf privilege, but 't has worn away\nin the weather since her time. I thought one or two bumps wouldn't hurt\nus none,--paint's got to be renewed, anyway,--but I never thought she'd\ntetch. I figured on shyin' by,” the captain apologized. “She's too gre't\na boat to handle well in here; but I used to sort of shy by in Joanna's\nday, an' cast a little somethin' ashore--some apples or a couple o'\npears if I had 'em--on the grass, where she'd be sure to see.”\n\nI stood watching while Captain Bowden cleverly found his way back to\ndeeper water. “You needn't make no haste,” he called to me; “I'll keep\nwithin call. Joanna lays right up there in the far corner o' the field.\nThere used to be a path led to the place. I always knew her well. I was\nout here to the funeral.”\n\nI found the path; it was touching to discover that this lonely spot was\nnot without its pilgrims. Later generations will know less and less of\nJoanna herself, but there are paths trodden to the shrines of solitude\nthe world over,--the world cannot forget them, try as it may; the feet\nof the young find them out because of curiosity and dim foreboding;\nwhile the old bring hearts full of remembrance. This plain anchorite had\nbeen one of those whom sorrow made too lonely to brave the sight of men,\ntoo timid to front the simple world she knew, yet valiant enough to live\nalone with her poor insistent human nature and the calms and passions of\nthe sea and sky.\n\nThe birds were flying all about the field; they fluttered up out of the\ngrass at my feet as I walked along, so tame that I liked to think they\nkept some happy tradition from summer to summer of the safety of nests\nand good fellowship of mankind. Poor Joanna's house was gone except\nthe stones of its foundations, and there was little trace of her flower\ngarden except a single faded sprig of much-enduring French pinks, which\na great bee and a yellow butterfly were befriending together. I drank at\nthe spring, and thought that now and then some one would follow me from\nthe busy, hard-worked, and simple-thoughted countryside of the mainland,\nwhich lay dim and dreamlike in the August haze, as Joanna must have\nwatched it many a day. There was the world, and here was she with\neternity well begun. In the life of each of us, I said to myself, there\nis a place remote and islanded, and given to endless regret or secret\nhappiness; we are each the uncompanioned hermit and recluse of an hour\nor a day; we understand our fellows of the cell to whatever age of\nhistory they may belong.\n\nBut as I stood alone on the island, in the sea-breeze, suddenly\nthere came a sound of distant voices; gay voices and laughter from a\npleasure-boat that was going seaward full of boys and girls. I knew, as\nif she had told me, that poor Joanna must have heard the like on many\nand many a summer afternoon, and must have welcomed the good cheer\nin spite of hopelessness and winter weather, and all the sorrow and\ndisappointment in the world.\n\n\n\n\nXVI. The Great Expedition\n\nMRS. TODD never by any chance gave warning over night of her great\nprojects and adventures by sea and land. She first came to an\nunderstanding with the primal forces of nature, and never trusted to any\npreliminary promise of good weather, but examined the day for herself in\nits infancy. Then, if the stars were propitious, and the wind blew\nfrom a quarter of good inheritance whence no surprises of sea-turns or\nsouthwest sultriness might be feared, long before I was fairly awake I\nused to hear a rustle and knocking like a great mouse in the walls, and\nan impatient tread on the steep garret stairs that led to Mrs. Todd's\nchief place of storage. She went and came as if she had already started\non her expedition with utmost haste and kept returning for something\nthat was forgotten. When I appeared in quest of my breakfast, she would\nbe absent-minded and sparing of speech, as if I had displeased her,\nand she was now, by main force of principle, holding herself back from\naltercation and strife of tongues.\n\nThese signs of a change became familiar to me in the course of time,\nand Mrs. Todd hardly noticed some plain proofs of divination one August\nmorning when I said, without preface, that I had just seen the Beggs'\nbest chaise go by, and that we should have to take the grocery. Mrs.\nTodd was alert in a moment.\n\n“There! I might have known!” she exclaimed. “It's the 15th of August,\nwhen he goes and gets his money. He heired an annuity from an uncle o'\nhis on his mother's side. I understood the uncle said none o' Sam Begg's\nwife's folks should make free with it, so after Sam's gone it'll all be\npast an' spent, like last summer. That's what Sam prospers on now, if\nyou can call it prosperin'. Yes, I might have known. 'Tis the 15th o'\nAugust with him, an' he gener'ly stops to dinner with a cousin's widow\non the way home. Feb'uary n' August is the times. Takes him 'bout all\nday to go an' come.”\n\nI heard this explanation with interest. The tone of Mrs. Todd's voice\nwas complaining at the last.\n\n“I like the grocery just as well as the chaise,” I hastened to say,\nreferring to a long-bodied high wagon with a canopy-top, like an\nattenuated four-posted bedstead on wheels, in which we sometimes\njourneyed. “We can put things in behind--roots and flowers and\nraspberries, or anything you are going after--much better than if we had\nthe chaise.”\n\nMrs. Todd looked stony and unwilling. “I counted upon the chaise,” she\nsaid, turning her back to me, and roughly pushing back all the quiet\ntumblers on the cupboard shelf as if they had been impertinent. “Yes, I\ndesired the chaise for once. I ain't goin' berryin' nor to fetch home no\nmore wilted vegetation this year. Season's about past, except for a poor\nfew o' late things,” she added in a milder tone. “I'm goin' up country.\nNo, I ain't intendin' to go berryin'. I've been plottin' for it the past\nfortnight and hopin' for a good day.”\n\n“Would you like to have me go too?” I asked frankly, but not without a\nhumble fear that I might have mistaken the purpose of this latest plan.\n\n“Oh certain, dear!” answered my friend affectionately. “Oh no, I never\nthought o' any one else for comp'ny, if it's convenient for you, long's\npoor mother ain't come. I ain't nothin' like so handy with a conveyance\nas I be with a good bo't. Comes o' my early bringing-up. I expect we've\ngot to make that great high wagon do. The tires want settin' and 'tis\nall loose-jointed, so I can hear it shackle the other side o' the ridge.\nWe'll put the basket in front. I ain't goin' to have it bouncin' an'\ntwirlin' all the way. Why, I've been makin' some nice hearts and rounds\nto carry.”\n\nThese were signs of high festivity, and my interest deepened moment by\nmoment.\n\n“I'll go down to the Beggs' and get the horse just as soon as I finish\nmy breakfast,” said I. “Then we can start whenever you are ready.”\n\nMrs. Todd looked cloudy again. “I don't know but you look nice enough to\ngo just as you be,” she suggested doubtfully. “No, you wouldn't want to\nwear that pretty blue dress o' yourn 'way up country. 'Taint dusty now,\nbut it may be comin' home. No, I expect you'd rather not wear that and\nthe other hat.”\n\n“Oh yes. I shouldn't think of wearing these clothes,” said I, with\nsudden illumination. “Why, if we're going up country and are likely to\nsee some of your friends, I'll put on my blue dress, and you must wear\nyour watch; I am not going at all if you mean to wear the big hat.”\n\n“Now you're behavin' pretty,” responded Mrs. Todd, with a gay toss of\nher head and a cheerful smile, as she came across the room, bringing\na saucerful of wild raspberries, a pretty piece of salvage from\nsupper-time. “I was cast down when I see you come to breakfast. I didn't\nthink 'twas just what you'd select to wear to the reunion, where you're\ngoin' to meet everybody.”\n\n“What reunion do you mean?” I asked, not without amazement. “Not the\nBowden Family's? I thought that was going to take place in September.”\n\n“To-day's the day. They sent word the middle o' the week. I thought you\nmight have heard of it. Yes, they changed the day. I been thinkin' we'd\ntalk it over, but you never can tell beforehand how it's goin' to be,\nand 'taint worth while to wear a day all out before it comes.” Mrs. Todd\ngave no place to the pleasures of anticipation, but she spoke like\nthe oracle that she was. “I wish mother was here to go,” she continued\nsadly. “I did look for her last night, and I couldn't keep back the\ntears when the dark really fell and she wa'n't here, she does so enjoy\na great occasion. If William had a mite o' snap an' ambition, he'd take\nthe lead at such a time. Mother likes variety, and there ain't but a\nfew nice opportunities 'round here, an' them she has to miss 'less she\ncontrives to get ashore to me. I do re'lly hate to go to the reunion\nwithout mother, an' 'tis a beautiful day; everybody'll be asking where\nshe is. Once she'd have got here anyway. Poor mother's beginnin' to feel\nher age.”\n\n“Why, there's your mother now!” I exclaimed with joy, I was so glad to\nsee the dear old soul again. “I hear her voice at the gate.” But Mrs.\nTodd was out of the door before me.\n\nThere, sure enough, stood Mrs. Blackett, who must have left Green Island\nbefore daylight. She had climbed the steep road from the waterside so\neagerly that she was out of breath, and was standing by the garden fence\nto rest. She held an old-fashioned brown wicker cap-basket in her hand,\nas if visiting were a thing of every day, and looked up at us as pleased\nand triumphant as a child.\n\n“Oh, what a poor, plain garden! Hardly a flower in it except your bush\no' balm!” she said. “But you do keep your garden neat, Almiry. Are you\nboth well, an' goin' up country with me?” She came a step or two closer\nto meet us, with quaint politeness and quite as delightful as if she\nwere at home. She dropped a quick little curtsey before Mrs. Todd.\n\n“There, mother, what a girl you be! I am so pleased! I was just\nbewailin' you,” said the daughter, with unwonted feeling. “I was just\nbewailin' you, I was so disappointed, an' I kep' myself awake a good\npiece o' the night scoldin' poor William. I watched for the boat till\nI was ready to shed tears yisterday, and when 'twas comin' dark I kep'\nmaking errands out to the gate an' down the road to see if you wa'n't in\nthe doldrums somewhere down the bay.”\n\n“There was a head-wind, as you know,” said Mrs. Blackett, giving me\nthe cap-basket, and holding my hand affectionately as we walked up the\nclean-swept path to the door. “I was partly ready to come, but dear\nWilliam said I should be all tired out and might get cold, havin'\nto beat all the way in. So we give it up, and set down and spent the\nevenin' together. It was a little rough and windy outside, and I guess\n'twas better judgment; we went to bed very early and made a good start\njust at daylight. It's been a lovely mornin' on the water. William\nthought he'd better fetch across beyond Bird Rocks, rowin' the greater\npart o' the way; then we sailed from there right over to the landin',\nmakin' only one tack. William'll be in again for me to-morrow, so I can\ncome back here an' rest me over night, an' go to meetin' to-morrow, and\nhave a nice, good visit.”\n\n“She was just havin' her breakfast,” said Mrs. Todd, who had listened\neagerly to the long explanation without a word of disapproval, while her\nface shone more and more with joy. “You just sit right down an' have\na cup of tea and rest you while we make our preparations. Oh, I am so\ngratified to think you've come! Yes, she was just havin' her breakfast,\nand we were speakin' of you. Where's William?”\n\n“He went right back; said he expected some schooners in about noon after\nbait, but he'll come an' have his dinner with us tomorrow, unless it\nrains; then next day. I laid his best things out all ready,” explained\nMrs. Blackett, a little anxiously. “This wind will serve him nice all\nthe way home. Yes, I will take a cup of tea, dear,--a cup of tea is\nalways good; and then I'll rest a minute and be all ready to start.”\n\n“I do feel condemned for havin' such hard thoughts o' William,” openly\nconfessed Mrs. Todd. She stood before us so large and serious that we\nboth laughed and could not find it in our hearts to convict so rueful a\nculprit. “He shall have a good dinner to-morrow, if it can be got, and\nI shall be real glad to see William,” the confession ended handsomely,\nwhile Mrs. Blackett smiled approval and made haste to praise the tea.\nThen I hurried away to make sure of the grocery wagon. Whatever might be\nthe good of the reunion, I was going to have the pleasure and delight of\na day in Mrs. Blackett's company, not to speak of Mrs. Todd's.\n\nThe early morning breeze was still blowing, and the warm, sunshiny air\nwas of some ethereal northern sort, with a cool freshness as it\ncame over new-fallen snow. The world was filled with a fragrance of\nfir-balsam and the faintest flavor of seaweed from the ledges, bare and\nbrown at low tide in the little harbor. It was so still and so early\nthat the village was but half awake. I could hear no voices but those of\nthe birds, small and great,--the constant song sparrows, the clink of\na yellow-hammer over in the woods, and the far conversation of some\ndeliberate crows. I saw William Blackett's escaping sail already far\nfrom land, and Captain Littlepage was sitting behind his closed window\nas I passed by, watching for some one who never came. I tried to speak\nto him, but he did not see me. There was a patient look on the old man's\nface, as if the world were a great mistake and he had nobody with whom\nto speak his own language or find companionship.\n\n\n\n\nXVII. A Country Road\n\nWHATEVER DOUBTS and anxieties I may have had about the inconvenience of\nthe Begg's high wagon for a person of Mrs. Blackett's age and shortness,\nthey were happily overcome by the aid of a chair and her own valiant\nspirit. Mrs. Todd bestowed great care upon seating us as if we were\ntaking passage by boat, but she finally pronounced that we were properly\ntrimmed. When we had gone only a little way up the hill she remembered\nthat she had left the house door wide open, though the large key was\nsafe in her pocket. I offered to run back, but my offer was met with\nlofty scorn, and we lightly dismissed the matter from our minds, until\ntwo or three miles further on we met the doctor, and Mrs. Todd asked him\nto stop and ask her nearest neighbor to step over and close the door if\nthe dust seemed to blow in the afternoon.\n\n“She'll be there in her kitchen; she'll hear you the minute you call;\n'twont give you no delay,” said Mrs. Todd to the doctor. “Yes, Mis'\nDennett's right there, with the windows all open. It isn't as if my fore\ndoor opened right on the road, anyway.” At which proof of composure Mrs.\nBlackett smiled wisely at me.\n\nThe doctor seemed delighted to see our guest; they were evidently the\nwarmest friends, and I saw a look of affectionate confidence in their\neyes. The good man left his carriage to speak to us, but as he took Mrs.\nBlackett's hand he held it a moment, and, as if merely from force of\nhabit, felt her pulse as they talked; then to my delight he gave the\nfirm old wrist a commending pat.\n\n“You're wearing well; good for another ten years at this rate,” he\nassured her cheerfully, and she smiled back. “I like to keep a strict\naccount of my old stand-bys,” and he turned to me. “Don't you let Mrs.\nTodd overdo to-day,--old folks like her are apt to be thoughtless;” and\nthen we all laughed, and, parting, went our ways gayly.\n\n“I suppose he puts up with your rivalry the same as ever?” asked Mrs.\nBlackett. “You and he are as friendly as ever, I see, Almiry,” and\nAlmira sagely nodded.\n\n“He's got too many long routes now to stop to 'tend to all his door\npatients,” she said, “especially them that takes pleasure in talkin'\nthemselves over. The doctor and me have got to be kind of partners; he's\ngone a good deal, far an' wide. Looked tired, didn't he? I shall have to\nadvise with him an' get him off for a good rest. He'll take the big boat\nfrom Rockland an' go off up to Boston an' mouse round among the other\ndoctors, one in two or three years, and come home fresh as a boy. I\nguess they think consider'ble of him up there.” Mrs. Todd shook the\nreins and reached determinedly for the whip, as if she were compelling\npublic opinion.\n\nWhatever energy and spirit the white horse had to begin with were soon\nexhausted by the steep hills and his discernment of a long expedition\nahead. We toiled slowly along. Mrs. Blackett and I sat together, and\nMrs. Todd sat alone in front with much majesty and the large basket of\nprovisions. Part of the way the road was shaded by thick woods, but we\nalso passed one farmhouse after another on the high uplands, which we\nall three regarded with deep interest, the house itself and the barns\nand garden-spots and poultry all having to suffer an inspection of the\nshrewdest sort. This was a highway quite new to me; in fact, most of my\njourneys with Mrs. Todd had been made afoot and between the roads, in\nopen pasturelands. My friends stopped several times for brief dooryard\nvisits, and made so many promises of stopping again on the way home\nthat I began to wonder how long the expedition would last. I had often\nnoticed how warmly Mrs. Todd was greeted by her friends, but it was\nhardly to be compared with the feeling now shown toward Mrs. Blackett.\nA look of delight came to the faces of those who recognized the plain,\ndear old figure beside me; one revelation after another was made of the\nconstant interest and intercourse that had linked the far island and\nthese scattered farms into a golden chain of love and dependence.\n\n“Now, we mustn't stop again if we can help it,” insisted Mrs. Todd at\nlast. “You'll get tired, mother, and you'll think the less o' reunions.\nWe can visit along here any day. There, if they ain't frying doughnuts\nin this next house, too! These are new folks, you know, from over St.\nGeorge way; they took this old Talcot farm last year. 'Tis the best\nwater on the road, and the check-rein's come undone--yes, we'd best\ndelay a little and water the horse.”\n\nWe stopped, and seeing a party of pleasure-seekers in holiday attire,\nthe thin, anxious mistress of the farmhouse came out with wistful\nsympathy to hear what news we might have to give. Mrs. Blackett\nfirst spied her at the half-closed door, and asked with such cheerful\ndirectness if we were trespassing that, after a few words, she went back\nto her kitchen and reappeared with a plateful of doughnuts.\n\n“Entertainment for man and beast,” announced Mrs. Todd with\nsatisfaction. “Why, we've perceived there was new doughnuts all along\nthe road, but you're the first that has treated us.”\n\nOur new acquaintance flushed with pleasure, but said nothing.\n\n“They're very nice; you've had good luck with 'em,” pronounced Mrs.\nTodd. “Yes, we've observed there was doughnuts all the way along; if one\nhouse is frying all the rest is; 'tis so with a great many things.”\n\n“I don't suppose likely you're goin' up to the Bowden reunion?” asked\nthe hostess as the white horse lifted his head and we were saying\ngood-by.\n\n“Why, yes,” said Mrs. Blackett and Mrs. Todd and I, all together.\n\n“I am connected with the family. Yes, I expect to be there this\nafternoon. I've been lookin' forward to it,” she told us eagerly.\n\n“We shall see you there. Come and sit with us if it's convenient,” said\ndear Mrs. Blackett, and we drove away.\n\n“I wonder who she was before she was married?” said Mrs. Todd, who was\nusually unerring in matters of genealogy. “She must have been one of\nthat remote branch that lived down beyond Thomaston. We can find out\nthis afternoon. I expect that the families'll march together, or be\nsorted out some way. I'm willing to own a relation that has such proper\nideas of doughnuts.”\n\n“I seem to see the family looks,” said Mrs. Blackett. “I wish we'd asked\nher name. She's a stranger, and I want to help make it pleasant for all\nsuch.”\n\n“She resembles Cousin Pa'lina Bowden about the forehead,” said Mrs. Todd\nwith decision.\n\nWe had just passed a piece of woodland that shaded the road, and come\nout to some open fields beyond, when Mrs. Todd suddenly reined in the\nhorse as if somebody had stood on the roadside and stopped her. She even\ngave that quick reassuring nod of her head which was usually made to\nanswer for a bow, but I discovered that she was looking eagerly at a\ntall ash-tree that grew just inside the field fence.\n\n“I thought 'twas goin' to do well,” she said complacently as we went on\nagain. “Last time I was up this way that tree was kind of drooping and\ndiscouraged. Grown trees act that way sometimes, same's folks; then\nthey'll put right to it and strike their roots off into new ground and\nstart all over again with real good courage. Ash-trees is very likely to\nhave poor spells; they ain't got the resolution of other trees.”\n\nI listened hopefully for more; it was this peculiar wisdom that made one\nvalue Mrs. Todd's pleasant company.\n\n“There's sometimes a good hearty tree growin' right out of the bare\nrock, out o' some crack that just holds the roots;” she went on to say,\n“right on the pitch o' one o' them bare stony hills where you can't seem\nto see a wheel-barrowful o' good earth in a place, but that tree'll keep\na green top in the driest summer. You lay your ear down to the ground\nan' you'll hear a little stream runnin'. Every such tree has got its own\nlivin' spring; there's folk made to match 'em.”\n\nI could not help turning to look at Mrs. Blackett, close beside me. Her\nhands were clasped placidly in their thin black woolen gloves, and\nshe was looking at the flowery wayside as we went slowly along, with a\npleased, expectant smile. I do not think she had heard a word about the\ntrees.\n\n“I just saw a nice plant o' elecampane growin' back there,” she said\npresently to her daughter.\n\n“I haven't got my mind on herbs to-day,” responded Mrs. Todd, in the\nmost matter-of-fact way. “I'm bent on seeing folks,” and she shook the\nreins again.\n\nI for one had no wish to hurry, it was so pleasant in the shady roads.\nThe woods stood close to the road on the right; on the left were narrow\nfields and pastures where there were as many acres of spruces and pines\nas there were acres of bay and juniper and huckleberry, with a little\nturf between. When I thought we were in the heart of the inland country,\nwe reached the top of a hill, and suddenly there lay spread out before\nus a wonderful great view of well-cleared fields that swept down to\nthe wide water of a bay. Beyond this were distant shores like another\ncountry in the midday haze which half hid the hills beyond, and the\nfaraway pale blue mountains on the northern horizon. There was a\nschooner with all sails set coming down the bay from a white village\nthat was sprinkled on the shore, and there were many sailboats flitting\nabout it. It was a noble landscape, and my eyes, which had grown used to\nthe narrow inspection of a shaded roadside, could hardly take it in.\n\n“Why, it's the upper bay,” said Mrs. Todd. “You can see 'way over into\nthe town of Fessenden. Those farms 'way over there are all in Fessenden.\nMother used to have a sister that lived up that shore. If we started as\nearly's we could on a summer mornin', we couldn't get to her place from\nGreen Island till late afternoon, even with a fair, steady breeze, and\nyou had to strike the time just right so as to fetch up 'long o' the\ntide and land near the flood. 'Twas ticklish business, an' we didn't\nvisit back an' forth as much as mother desired. You have to go 'way down\nthe co'st to Cold Spring Light an' round that long point,--up here's\nwhat they call the Back Shore.”\n\n“No, we were 'most always separated, my dear sister and me, after the\nfirst year she was married,” said Mrs. Blackett. “We had our little\nfamilies an' plenty o' cares. We were always lookin' forward to the time\nwe could see each other more. Now and then she'd get out to the island\nfor a few days while her husband'd go fishin'; and once he stopped with\nher an' two children, and made him some flakes right there and cured all\nhis fish for winter. We did have a beautiful time together, sister an'\nme; she used to look back to it long's she lived.\n\n“I do love to look over there where she used to live,” Mrs. Blackett\nwent on as we began to go down the hill. “It seems as if she must still\nbe there, though she's long been gone. She loved their farm,--she didn't\nsee how I got so used to our island; but somehow I was always happy from\nthe first.”\n\n“Yes, it's very dull to me up among those slow farms,” declared Mrs.\nTodd. “The snow troubles 'em in winter. They're all besieged by winter,\nas you may say; 'tis far better by the shore than up among such places.\nI never thought I should like to live up country.”\n\n“Why, just see the carriages ahead of us on the next rise!” exclaimed\nMrs. Blackett. “There's going to be a great gathering, don't you believe\nthere is, Almiry? It hasn't seemed up to now as if anybody was going but\nus. An' 'tis such a beautiful day, with yesterday cool and pleasant to\nwork an' get ready, I shouldn't wonder if everybody was there, even the\nslow ones like Phebe Ann Brock.”\n\nMrs. Blackett's eyes were bright with excitement, and even Mrs. Todd\nshowed remarkable enthusiasm. She hurried the horse and caught up with\nthe holiday-makers ahead. “There's all the Dep'fords goin', six in the\nwagon,” she told us joyfully; “an' Mis' Alva Tilley's folks are now\nrisin' the hill in their new carry-all.”\n\nMrs. Blackett pulled at the neat bow of her black bonnet-strings, and\ntied them again with careful precision. “I believe your bonnet's on\na little bit sideways, dear,” she advised Mrs. Todd as if she were a\nchild; but Mrs. Todd was too much occupied to pay proper heed. We began\nto feel a new sense of gayety and of taking part in the great occasion\nas we joined the little train.\n\n\n\n\nXVIII. The Bowden Reunion\n\nIT IS VERY RARE in country life, where high days and holidays are few,\nthat any occasion of general interest proves to be less than great. Such\nis the hidden fire of enthusiasm in the New England nature that, once\ngiven an outlet, it shines forth with almost volcanic light and heat. In\nquiet neighborhoods such inward force does not waste itself upon those\npetty excitements of every day that belong to cities, but when, at\nlong intervals, the altars to patriotism, to friendship, to the ties\nof kindred, are reared in our familiar fields, then the fires glow, the\nflames come up as if from the inexhaustible burning heart of the earth;\nthe primal fires break through the granite dust in which our souls are\nset. Each heart is warm and every face shines with the ancient light.\nSuch a day as this has transfiguring powers, and easily makes friends of\nthose who have been cold-hearted, and gives to those who are dumb their\nchance to speak, and lends some beauty to the plainest face.\n\n“Oh, I expect I shall meet friends today that I haven't seen in a long\nwhile,” said Mrs. Blackett with deep satisfaction. “'Twill bring out a\ngood many of the old folks, 'tis such a lovely day. I'm always glad not\nto have them disappointed.”\n\n“I guess likely the best of 'em'll be there,” answered Mrs. Todd with\ngentle humor, stealing a glance at me. “There's one thing certain:\nthere's nothing takes in this whole neighborhood like anything related\nto the Bowdens. Yes, I do feel that when you call upon the Bowdens you\nmay expect most families to rise up between the Landing and the far end\nof the Back Cove. Those that aren't kin by blood are kin by marriage.”\n\n“There used to be an old story goin' about when I was a girl,” said Mrs.\nBlackett, with much amusement. “There was a great many more Bowdens then\nthan there are now, and the folks was all setting in meeting a dreadful\nhot Sunday afternoon, and a scatter-witted little bound girl came\nrunning to the meetin'-house door all out o' breath from somewheres in\nthe neighborhood. 'Mis' Bowden, Mis' Bowden!' says she. 'Your baby's in\na fit!' They used to tell that the whole congregation was up on its\nfeet in a minute and right out into the aisles. All the Mis' Bowdens\nwas setting right out for home; the minister stood there in the pulpit\ntryin' to keep sober, an' all at once he burst right out laughin'. He\nwas a very nice man, they said, and he said he'd better give 'em the\nbenediction, and they could hear the sermon next Sunday, so he kept it\nover. My mother was there, and she thought certain 'twas me.”\n\n“None of our family was ever subject to fits,” interrupted Mrs. Todd\nseverely. “No, we never had fits, none of us; and 'twas lucky we didn't\n'way out there to Green Island. Now these folks right in front; dear\nsakes knows the bunches o' soothing catnip an' yarrow I've had to favor\nold Mis' Evins with dryin'! You can see it right in their expressions,\nall them Evins folks. There, just you look up to the crossroads,\nmother,” she suddenly exclaimed. “See all the teams ahead of us. And,\noh, look down on the bay; yes, look down on the bay! See what a sight o'\nboats, all headin' for the Bowden place cove!”\n\n“Oh, ain't it beautiful!” said Mrs. Blackett, with all the delight of a\ngirl. She stood up in the high wagon to see everything, and when she sat\ndown again she took fast hold of my hand.\n\n“Hadn't you better urge the horse a little, Almiry?” she asked. “He's\nhad it easy as we came along, and he can rest when we get there. The\nothers are some little ways ahead, and I don't want to lose a minute.”\n\nWe watched the boats drop their sails one by one in the cove as we\ndrove along the high land. The old Bowden house stood, low-storied and\nbroad-roofed, in its green fields as if it were a motherly brown hen\nwaiting for the flock that came straying toward it from every direction.\nThe first Bowden settler had made his home there, and it was still the\nBowden farm; five generations of sailors and farmers and soldiers\nhad been its children. And presently Mrs. Blackett showed me the\nstone-walled burying-ground that stood like a little fort on a knoll\noverlooking the bay, but, as she said, there were plenty of scattered\nBowdens who were not laid there,--some lost at sea, and some out West,\nand some who died in the war; most of the home graves were those of\nwomen.\n\nWe could see now that there were different footpaths from along shore\nand across country. In all these there were straggling processions\nwalking in single file, like old illustrations of the Pilgrim's\nProgress. There was a crowd about the house as if huge bees were\nswarming in the lilac bushes. Beyond the fields and cove a higher point\nof land ran out into the bay, covered with woods which must have kept\naway much of the northwest wind in winter. Now there was a pleasant look\nof shade and shelter there for the great family meeting.\n\nWe hurried on our way, beginning to feel as if we were very late, and it\nwas a great satisfaction at last to turn out of the stony highroad into\na green lane shaded with old apple-trees. Mrs. Todd encouraged the horse\nuntil he fairly pranced with gayety as we drove round to the front of\nthe house on the soft turf. There was an instant cry of rejoicing, and\ntwo or three persons ran toward us from the busy group.\n\n“Why, dear Mis' Blackett!--here's Mis' Blackett!” I heard them say, as\nif it were pleasure enough for one day to have a sight of her. Mrs. Todd\nturned to me with a lovely look of triumph and self-forgetfulness. An\nelderly man who wore the look of a prosperous sea-captain put up both\narms and lifted Mrs. Blackett down from the high wagon like a child, and\nkissed her with hearty affection. “I was master afraid she wouldn't be\nhere,” he said, looking at Mrs. Todd with a face like a happy sunburnt\nschoolboy, while everybody crowded round to give their welcome.\n\n“Mother's always the queen,” said Mrs. Todd. “Yes, they'll all make\neverything of mother; she'll have a lovely time to-day. I wouldn't have\nhad her miss it, and there won't be a thing she'll ever regret, except\nto mourn because William wa'n't here.”\n\nMrs. Blackett having been properly escorted to the house, Mrs. Todd\nreceived her own full share of honor, and some of the men, with a simple\nkindness that was the soul of chivalry, waited upon us and our baskets\nand led away the white horse. I already knew some of Mrs. Todd's friends\nand kindred, and felt like an adopted Bowden in this happy moment. It\nseemed to be enough for anyone to have arrived by the same conveyance as\nMrs. Blackett, who presently had her court inside the house, while Mrs.\nTodd, large, hospitable, and preeminent, was the centre of a rapidly\nincreasing crowd about the lilac bushes. Small companies were\ncontinually coming up the long green slope from the water, and nearly\nall the boats had come to shore. I counted three or four that were\nbaffled by the light breeze, but before long all the Bowdens, small and\ngreat, seemed to have assembled, and we started to go up to the grove\nacross the field.\n\nOut of the chattering crowd of noisy children, and large-waisted women\nwhose best black dresses fell straight to the ground in generous folds,\nand sunburnt men who looked as serious as if it were town-meeting day,\nthere suddenly came silence and order. I saw the straight, soldierly\nlittle figure of a man who bore a fine resemblance to Mrs. Blackett, and\nwho appeared to marshal us with perfect ease. He was imperative enough,\nbut with a grand military sort of courtesy, and bore himself with solemn\ndignity of importance. We were sorted out according to some clear design\nof his own, and stood as speechless as a troop to await his orders. Even\nthe children were ready to march together, a pretty flock, and at\nthe last moment Mrs. Blackett and a few distinguished companions, the\nministers and those who were very old, came out of the house together\nand took their places. We ranked by fours, and even then we made a long\nprocession.\n\nThere was a wide path mowed for us across the field, and, as we moved\nalong, the birds flew up out of the thick second crop of clover, and\nthe bees hummed as if it still were June. There was a flashing of\nwhite gulls over the water where the fleet of boats rode the low waves\ntogether in the cove, swaying their small masts as if they kept time to\nour steps. The plash of the water could be heard faintly, yet still be\nheard; we might have been a company of ancient Greeks going to celebrate\na victory, or to worship the god of harvests, in the grove above. It was\nstrangely moving to see this and to make part of it. The sky, the sea,\nhave watched poor humanity at its rites so long; we were no more a New\nEngland family celebrating its own existence and simple progress; we\ncarried the tokens and inheritance of all such households from which\nthis had descended, and were only the latest of our line. We possessed\nthe instincts of a far, forgotten childhood; I found myself thinking\nthat we ought to be carrying green branches and singing as we went.\nSo we came to the thick shaded grove still silent, and were set in\nour places by the straight trees that swayed together and let sunshine\nthrough here and there like a single golden leaf that flickered down,\nvanishing in the cool shade.\n\nThe grove was so large that the great family looked far smaller than it\nhad in the open field; there was a thick growth of dark pines and firs\nwith an occasional maple or oak that gave a gleam of color like a bright\nwindow in the great roof. On three sides we could see the water, shining\nbehind the tree-trunks, and feel the cool salt breeze that began to come\nup with the tide just as the day reached its highest point of heat. We\ncould see the green sunlit field we had just crossed as if we looked\nout at it from a dark room, and the old house and its lilacs standing\nplacidly in the sun, and the great barn with a stockade of carriages\nfrom which two or three care-taking men who had lingered were coming\nacross the field together. Mrs. Todd had taken off her warm gloves and\nlooked the picture of content.\n\n“There!” she exclaimed. “I've always meant to have you see this place,\nbut I never looked for such a beautiful opportunity--weather an'\noccasion both made to match. Yes, it suits me: I don't ask no more. I\nwant to know if you saw mother walkin' at the head! It choked me right\nup to see mother at the head, walkin' with the ministers,” and Mrs. Todd\nturned away to hide the feelings she could not instantly control.\n\n“Who was the marshal?” I hastened to ask. “Was he an old soldier?”\n\n“Don't he do well?” answered Mrs. Todd with satisfaction.\n\n“He don't often have such a chance to show off his gifts,” said Mrs.\nCaplin, a friend from the Landing who had joined us. “That's Sant\nBowden; he always takes the lead, such days. Good for nothing else most\no' his time; trouble is, he”--\n\nI turned with interest to hear the worst. Mrs. Caplin's tone was both\nzealous and impressive.\n\n“Stim'lates,” she explained scornfully.\n\n“No, Santin never was in the war,” said Mrs. Todd with lofty\nindifference. “It was a cause of real distress to him. He kep'\nenlistin', and traveled far an' wide about here, an' even took the bo't\nand went to Boston to volunteer; but he ain't a sound man, an' they\nwouldn't have him. They say he knows all their tactics, an' can tell all\nabout the battle o' Waterloo well's he can Bunker Hill. I told him once\nthe country'd lost a great general, an' I meant it, too.”\n\n“I expect you're near right,” said Mrs. Caplin, a little crestfallen and\napologetic.\n\n“I be right,” insisted Mrs. Todd with much amiability. “'Twas most too\nbad to cramp him down to his peaceful trade, but he's a most excellent\nshoemaker at his best, an' he always says it's a trade that gives him\ntime to think an' plan his maneuvers. Over to the Port they always\ninvite him to march Decoration Day, same as the rest, an' he does look\nnoble; he comes of soldier stock.”\n\nI had been noticing with great interest the curiously French type of\nface which prevailed in this rustic company. I had said to myself before\nthat Mrs. Blackett was plainly of French descent, in both her appearance\nand her charming gifts, but this is not surprising when one has learned\nhow large a proportion of the early settlers on this northern coast\nof New England were of Huguenot blood, and that it is the Norman\nEnglishman, not the Saxon, who goes adventuring to a new world.\n\n“They used to say in old times,” said Mrs. Todd modestly, “that our\nfamily came of very high folks in France, and one of 'em was a great\ngeneral in some o' the old wars. I sometimes think that Santin's ability\nhas come 'way down from then. 'Tain't nothin' he's ever acquired; 'twas\nborn in him. I don't know's he ever saw a fine parade, or met with those\nthat studied up such things. He's figured it all out an' got his papers\nso he knows how to aim a cannon right for William's fish-house five\nmiles out on Green Island, or up there on Burnt Island where the\nsignal is. He had it all over to me one day, an' I tried hard to appear\ninterested. His life's all in it, but he will have those poor gloomy\nspells come over him now an' then, an' then he has to drink.”\n\nMrs. Caplin gave a heavy sigh.\n\n“There's a great many such strayaway folks, just as there is plants,”\n continued Mrs. Todd, who was nothing if not botanical. “I know of just\none sprig of laurel that grows over back here in a wild spot, an' I\nnever could hear of no other on this coast. I had a large bunch brought\nme once from Massachusetts way, so I know it. This piece grows in\nan open spot where you'd think 'twould do well, but it's sort o'\npoor-lookin'. I've visited it time an' again, just to notice its poor\nblooms. 'Tis a real Sant Bowden, out of its own place.”\n\nMrs. Caplin looked bewildered and blank. “Well, all I know is, last year\nhe worked out some kind of plan so's to parade the county conference in\nplatoons, and got 'em all flustered up tryin' to sense his ideas of a\nholler square,” she burst forth. “They was holler enough anyway after\nridin' 'way down from up country into the salt air, and they'd been\ntreated to a sermon on faith an' works from old Fayther Harlow that\nnever knows when to cease. 'Twa'n't no time for tactics then,--they\nwa'n't a'thinkin' of the church military. Sant, he couldn't do nothin'\nwith 'em. All he thinks of, when he sees a crowd, is how to march 'em.\n'Tis all very well when he don't 'tempt too much. He never did act like\nother folks.”\n\n“Ain't I just been maintainin' that he ain't like 'em?” urged Mrs. Todd\ndecidedly. “Strange folks has got to have strange ways, for what I see.”\n\n“Somebody observed once that you could pick out the likeness of 'most\nevery sort of a foreigner when you looked about you in our parish,” said\nSister Caplin, her face brightening with sudden illumination. “I didn't\nsee the bearin' of it then quite so plain. I always did think Mari'\nHarris resembled a Chinee.”\n\n“Mari' Harris was pretty as a child, I remember,” said the pleasant\nvoice of Mrs. Blackett, who, after receiving the affectionate greetings\nof nearly the whole company, came to join us,--to see, as she insisted,\nthat we were out of mischief.\n\n“Yes, Mari' was one o' them pretty little lambs that make dreadful\nhomely old sheep,” replied Mrs. Todd with energy. “Cap'n Littlepage\nnever'd look so disconsolate if she was any sort of a proper person\nto direct things. She might divert him; yes, she might divert the old\ngentleman, an' let him think he had his own way, 'stead o' arguing\neverything down to the bare bone. 'Twouldn't hurt her to sit down an'\nhear his great stories once in a while.”\n\n“The stories are very interesting,” I ventured to say.\n\n“Yes, you always catch yourself a-thinkin' what if they all was true,\nand he had the right of it,” answered Mrs. Todd. “He's a good sight\nbetter company, though dreamy, than such sordid creatur's as Mari'\nHarris.”\n\n“Live and let live,” said dear old Mrs. Blackett gently. “I haven't seen\nthe captain for a good while, now that I ain't so constant to meetin',”\n she added wistfully. “We always have known each other.”\n\n“Why, if it is a good pleasant day tomorrow, I'll get William to call\nan' invite the capt'in to dinner. William'll be in early so's to pass up\nthe street without meetin' anybody.”\n\n“There, they're callin' out it's time to set the tables,” said Mrs.\nCaplin, with great excitement.\n\n“Here's Cousin Sarah Jane Blackett! Well, I am pleased, certain!”\n exclaimed Mrs. Todd, with unaffected delight; and these kindred spirits\nmet and parted with the promise of a good talk later on. After this\nthere was no more time for conversation until we were seated in order at\nthe long tables.\n\n“I'm one that always dreads seeing some o' the folks that I don't like,\nat such a time as this,” announced Mrs. Todd privately to me after a\nseason of reflection. We were just waiting for the feast to begin. “You\nwouldn't think such a great creatur' 's I be could feel all over pins\nan' needles. I remember, the day I promised to Nathan, how it come over\nme, just's I was feelin' happy's I could, that I'd got to have an own\ncousin o' his for my near relation all the rest o' my life, an' it\nseemed as if die I should. Poor Nathan saw somethin' had crossed me,--he\nhad very nice feelings,--and when he asked what 'twas, I told him. 'I\nnever could like her myself,' said he. 'You sha'n't be bothered, dear,'\nhe says; an' 'twas one o' the things that made me set a good deal by\nNathan, he did not make a habit of always opposin', like some men.\n'Yes,' says I, 'but think o' Thanksgivin' times an' funerals; she's our\nrelation, an' we've got to own her.' Young folks don't think o' those\nthings. There she goes now, do let's pray her by!” said Mrs. Todd, with\nan alarming transition from general opinions to particular animosities.\n“I hate her just the same as I always did; but she's got on a real\npretty dress. I do try to remember that she's Nathan's cousin. Oh dear,\nwell; she's gone by after all, an' ain't seen me. I expected she'd\ncome pleasantin' round just to show off an' say afterwards she was\nacquainted.”\n\nThis was so different from Mrs. Todd's usual largeness of mind that I\nhad a moment's uneasiness; but the cloud passed quickly over her spirit,\nand was gone with the offender.\n\nThere never was a more generous out-of-door feast along the coast then\nthe Bowden family set forth that day. To call it a picnic would make it\nseem trivial. The great tables were edged with pretty oak-leaf\ntrimming, which the boys and girls made. We brought flowers from the\nfence-thickets of the great field; and out of the disorder of flowers\nand provisions suddenly appeared as orderly a scheme for the feast\nas the marshal had shaped for the procession. I began to respect the\nBowdens for their inheritance of good taste and skill and a certain\npleasing gift of formality. Something made them do all these things in a\nfiner way than most country people would have done them. As I looked up\nand down the tables there was a good cheer, a grave soberness that shone\nwith pleasure, a humble dignity of bearing. There were some who should\nhave sat below the salt for lack of this good breeding; but they were\nnot many. So, I said to myself, their ancestors may have sat in the\ngreat hall of some old French house in the Middle Ages, when battles and\nsieges and processions and feasts were familiar things. The ministers\nand Mrs. Blackett, with a few of their rank and age, were put in places\nof honor, and for once that I looked any other way I looked twice\nat Mrs. Blackett's face, serene and mindful of privilege and\nresponsibility, the mistress by simple fitness of this great day.\n\nMrs. Todd looked up at the roof of green trees, and then carefully\nsurveyed the company. “I see 'em better now they're all settin' down,”\n she said with satisfaction. “There's old Mr. Gilbraith and his sister. I\nwish they were sittin' with us; they're not among folks they can parley\nwith, an' they look disappointed.”\n\nAs the feast went on, the spirits of my companion steadily rose. The\nexcitement of an unexpectedly great occasion was a subtle stimulant\nto her disposition, and I could see that sometimes when Mrs. Todd had\nseemed limited and heavily domestic, she had simply grown sluggish for\nlack of proper surroundings. She was not so much reminiscent now as\nexpectant, and as alert and gay as a girl. We who were her neighbors\nwere full of gayety, which was but the reflected light from her beaming\ncountenance. It was not the first time that I was full of wonder at\nthe waste of human ability in this world, as a botanist wonders at\nthe wastefulness of nature, the thousand seeds that die, the unused\nprovision of every sort. The reserve force of society grows more and\nmore amazing to one's thought. More than one face among the Bowdens\nshowed that only opportunity and stimulus were lacking,--a narrow set of\ncircumstances had caged a fine able character and held it captive.\nOne sees exactly the same types in a country gathering as in the most\nbrilliant city company. You are safe to be understood if the spirit of\nyour speech is the same for one neighbor as for the other.\n\n\n\n\nXIX. The Feast's End\n\nTHE FEAST was a noble feast, as has already been said. There was an\nelegant ingenuity displayed in the form of pies which delighted my\nheart. Once acknowledge that an American pie is far to be preferred to\nits humble ancestor, the English tart, and it is joyful to be reassured\nat a Bowden reunion that invention has not yet failed. Beside a\ndelightful variety of material, the decorations went beyond all my\nformer experience; dates and names were wrought in lines of pastry and\nfrosting on the tops. There was even more elaborate reading matter on an\nexcellent early-apple pie which we began to share and eat, precept upon\nprecept. Mrs. Todd helped me generously to the whole word BOWDEN, and\nconsumed REUNION herself, save an undecipherable fragment; but the most\nrenowned essay in cookery on the tables was a model of the old Bowden\nhouse made of durable gingerbread, with all the windows and doors in the\nright places, and sprigs of genuine lilac set at the front. It must have\nbeen baked in sections, in one of the last of the great brick ovens, and\nfastened together on the morning of the day. There was a general sigh\nwhen this fell into ruin at the feast's end, and it was shared by a\ngreat part of the assembly, not without seriousness, and as if it were\na pledge and token of loyalty. I met the maker of the gingerbread house,\nwhich had called up lively remembrances of a childish story. She had the\ngleaming eye of an enthusiast and a look of high ideals.\n\n“I could just as well have made it all of frosted cake,” she said, “but\n'twouldn't have been the right shade; the old house, as you observe, was\nnever painted, and I concluded that plain gingerbread would represent it\nbest. It wasn't all I expected it would be,” she said sadly, as many an\nartist had said before her of his work.\n\nThere were speeches by the ministers; and there proved to be a historian\namong the Bowdens, who gave some fine anecdotes of the family history;\nand then appeared a poetess, whom Mrs. Todd regarded with wistful\ncompassion and indulgence, and when the long faded garland of verses\ncame to an appealing end, she turned to me with words of praise.\n\n“Sounded pretty,” said the generous listener. “Yes, I thought she did\nvery well. We went to school together, an' Mary Anna had a very hard\ntime; trouble was, her mother thought she'd given birth to a genius,\nan' Mary Anna's come to believe it herself. There, I don't know what\nwe should have done without her; there ain't nobody else that can write\npoetry between here and 'way up towards Rockland; it adds a great deal\nat such a time. When she speaks o' those that are gone, she feels it\nall, and so does everybody else, but she harps too much. I'd laid half\nof that away for next time, if I was Mary Anna. There comes mother to\nspeak to her, an' old Mr. Gilbreath's sister; now she'll be heartened\nright up. Mother'll say just the right thing.”\n\nThe leave-takings were as affecting as the meetings of these old friends\nhad been. There were enough young persons at the reunion, but it is the\nold who really value such opportunities; as for the young, it is the\nhabit of every day to meet their comrades,--the time of separation\nhas not come. To see the joy with which these elder kinsfolk and\nacquaintances had looked in one another's faces, and the lingering touch\nof their friendly hands; to see these affectionate meetings and then the\nreluctant partings, gave one a new idea of the isolation in which it was\npossible to live in that after all thinly settled region. They did not\nexpect to see one another again very soon; the steady, hard work on\nthe farms, the difficulty of getting from place to place, especially in\nwinter when boats were laid up, gave double value to any occasion which\ncould bring a large number of families together. Even funerals in this\ncountry of the pointed firs were not without their social advantages\nand satisfactions. I heard the words “next summer” repeated many times,\nthough summer was still ours and all the leaves were green.\n\nThe boats began to put out from shore, and the wagons to drive away.\nMrs. Blackett took me into the old house when we came back from the\ngrove: it was her father's birthplace and early home, and she had spent\nmuch of her own childhood there with her grandmother. She spoke of those\ndays as if they had but lately passed; in fact, I could imagine that\nthe house looked almost exactly the same to her. I could see the brown\nrafters of the unfinished roof as I looked up the steep staircase,\nthough the best room was as handsome with its good wainscoting and touch\nof ornament on the cornice as any old room of its day in a town.\n\nSome of the guests who came from a distance were still sitting in the\nbest room when we went in to take leave of the master and mistress of\nthe house. We all said eagerly what a pleasant day it had been, and\nhow swiftly the time had passed. Perhaps it is the great national\nanniversaries which our country has lately kept, and the soldiers'\nmeetings that take place everywhere, which have made reunions of every\nsort the fashion. This one, at least, had been very interesting. I\nfancied that old feuds had been overlooked, and the old saying that\nblood is thicker than water had again proved itself true, though from\nthe variety of names one argued a certain adulteration of the Bowden\ntraits and belongings. Clannishness is an instinct of the heart,--it is\nmore than a birthright, or a custom; and lesser rights were forgotten in\nthe claim to a common inheritance.\n\nWe were among the very last to return to our proper lives and lodgings.\nI came near to feeling like a true Bowden, and parted from certain new\nfriends as if they were old friends; we were rich with the treasure of a\nnew remembrance.\n\nAt last we were in the high wagon again; the old white horse had been\nwell fed in the Bowden barn, and we drove away and soon began to climb\nthe long hill toward the wooded ridge. The road was new to me, as roads\nalways are, going back. Most of our companions had been full of anxious\nthoughts of home,--of the cows, or of young children likely to fall\ninto disaster,--but we had no reasons for haste, and drove slowly along,\ntalking and resting by the way. Mrs. Todd said once that she really\nhoped her front door had been shut on account of the dust blowing in,\nbut added that nothing made any weight on her mind except not to forget\nto turn a few late mullein leaves that were drying on a newspaper in the\nlittle loft. Mrs. Blackett and I gave our word of honor that we would\nremind her of this heavy responsibility. The way seemed short, we had\nso much to talk about. We climbed hills where we could see the great\nbay and the islands, and then went down into shady valleys where the air\nbegan to feel like evening, cool and camp with a fragrance of wet ferns.\nMrs. Todd alighted once or twice, refusing all assistance in securing\nsome boughs of a rare shrub which she valued for its bark, though she\nproved incommunicative as to her reasons. We passed the house where we\nhad been so kindly entertained with doughnuts earlier in the day, and\nfound it closed and deserted, which was a disappointment.\n\n“They must have stopped to tea somewheres and thought they'd finish up\nthe day,” said Mrs. Todd. “Those that enjoyed it best'll want to get\nright home so's to think it over.”\n\n“I didn't see the woman there after all, did you?” asked Mrs. Blackett\nas the horse stopped to drink at the trough.\n\n“Oh yes, I spoke with her,” answered Mrs. Todd, with but scant interest\nor approval. “She ain't a member o' our family.”\n\n“I thought you said she resembled Cousin Pa'lina Bowden about the\nforehead,” suggested Mrs. Blackett.\n\n“Well, she don't,” answered Mrs. Todd impatiently. “I ain't one that's\nord'narily mistaken about family likenesses, and she didn't seem to meet\nwith friends, so I went square up to her. 'I expect you're a Bowden by\nyour looks,' says I. 'Yes, I can take it you're one o' the Bowdens.'\n'Lor', no,' says she. 'Dennett was my maiden name, but I married a\nBowden for my first husband. I thought I'd come an' just see what was\na-goin' on!”\n\nMrs. Blackett laughed heartily. “I'm goin' to remember to tell William\no' that,” she said. “There, Almiry, the only thing that's troubled me\nall this day is to think how William would have enjoyed it. I do so wish\nWilliam had been there.”\n\n“I sort of wish he had, myself,” said Mrs. Todd frankly.\n\n“There wa'n't many old folks there, somehow,” said Mrs. Blackett, with\na touch of sadness in her voice. “There ain't so many to come as there\nused to be, I'm aware, but I expected to see more.”\n\n“I thought they turned out pretty well, when you come to think of it;\nwhy, everybody was sayin' so an' feelin' gratified,” answered Mrs. Todd\nhastily with pleasing unconsciousness; then I saw the quick color flash\ninto her cheek, and presently she made some excuse to turn and steal an\nanxious look at her mother. Mrs. Blackett was smiling and thinking about\nher happy day, though she began to look a little tired. Neither of my\ncompanions was troubled by her burden of years. I hoped in my heart that\nI might be like them as I lived on into age, and then smiled to think\nthat I too was no longer very young. So we always keep the same hearts,\nthough our outer framework fails and shows the touch of time.\n\n“'Twas pretty when they sang the hymn, wasn't it?” asked Mrs. Blackett\nat suppertime, with real enthusiasm. “There was such a plenty o' men's\nvoices; where I sat it did sound beautiful. I had to stop and listen\nwhen they came to the last verse.”\n\nI saw that Mrs. Todd's broad shoulders began to shake. “There was good\nsingers there; yes, there was excellent singers,” she agreed heartily,\nputting down her teacup, “but I chanced to drift alongside Mis' Peter\nBowden o' Great Bay, an' I couldn't help thinkin' if she was as far out\no' town as she was out o' tune, she wouldn't get back in a day.”\n\n\n\n\nXX. Along Shore\n\nONE DAY as I went along the shore beyond the old wharves and the newer,\nhigh-stepped fabric of the steamer landing, I saw that all the boats\nwere beached, and the slack water period of the early afternoon\nprevailed. Nothing was going on, not even the most leisurely of\noccupations, like baiting trawls or mending nets, or repairing lobster\npots; the very boats seemed to be taking an afternoon nap in the sun.\nI could hardly discover a distant sail as I looked seaward, except a\nweather-beaten lobster smack, which seemed to have been taken for a\nplaything by the light airs that blew about the bay. It drifted and\nturned about so aimlessly in the wide reach off Burnt Island, that I\nsuspected there was nobody at the wheel, or that she might have parted\nher rusty anchor chain while all the crew were asleep.\n\nI watched her for a minute or two; she was the old Miranda, owned by\nsome of the Caplins, and I knew her by an odd shaped patch of newish\nduck that was set into the peak of her dingy mainsail. Her vagaries\noffered such an exciting subject for conversation that my heart rejoiced\nat the sound of a hoarse voice behind me. At that moment, before I\nhad time to answer, I saw something large and shapeless flung from the\nMiranda's deck that splashed the water high against her black side,\nand my companion gave a satisfied chuckle. The old lobster smack's sail\ncaught the breeze again at this moment, and she moved off down the bay.\nTurning, I found old Elijah Tilley, who had come softly out of his dark\nfish-house, as if it were a burrow.\n\n“Boy got kind o' drowsy steerin' of her; Monroe he hove him right\noverboard; 'wake now fast enough,” explained Mr. Tilley, and we laughed\ntogether.\n\nI was delighted, for my part, that the vicissitudes and dangers of the\nMiranda, in a rocky channel, should have given me this opportunity to\nmake acquaintance with an old fisherman to whom I had never spoken. At\nfirst he had seemed to be one of those evasive and uncomfortable persons\nwho are so suspicious of you that they make you almost suspicious of\nyourself. Mr. Elijah Tilley appeared to regard a stranger with scornful\nindifference. You might see him standing on the pebble beach or in a\nfish-house doorway, but when you came nearer he was gone. He was one of\nthe small company of elderly, gaunt-shaped great fisherman whom I used\nto like to see leading up a deep-laden boat by the head, as if it were\na horse, from the water's edge to the steep slope of the pebble beach.\nThere were four of these large old men at the Landing, who were the\nsurvivors of an earlier and more vigorous generation. There was an\nalliance and understanding between them, so close that it was apparently\nspeechless. They gave much time to watching one another's boats go out\nor come in; they lent a ready hand at tending one another's lobster\ntraps in rough weather; they helped to clean the fish or to sliver\nporgies for the trawls, as if they were in close partnership; and when\na boat came in from deep-sea fishing they were never too far out of\nthe way, and hastened to help carry it ashore, two by two, splashing\nalongside, or holding its steady head, as if it were a willful sea colt.\nAs a matter of fact no boat could help being steady and way-wise under\ntheir instant direction and companionship. Abel's boat and Jonathan\nBowden's boat were as distinct and experienced personalities as the men\nthemselves, and as inexpressive. Arguments and opinions were unknown\nto the conversation of these ancient friends; you would as soon have\nexpected to hear small talk in a company of elephants as to hear old Mr.\nBowden or Elijah Tilley and their two mates waste breath upon any form\nof trivial gossip. They made brief statements to one another from time\nto time. As you came to know them you wondered more and more that\nthey should talk at all. Speech seemed to be a light and elegant\naccomplishment, and their unexpected acquaintance with its arts made\nthem of new value to the listener. You felt almost as if a landmark pine\nshould suddenly address you in regard to the weather, or a lofty-minded\nold camel make a remark as you stood respectfully near him under the\ncircus tent.\n\nI often wondered a great deal about the inner life and thought of these\nself-contained old fishermen; their minds seemed to be fixed upon nature\nand the elements rather than upon any contrivances of man, like politics\nor theology. My friend, Captain Bowden, who was the nephew of the eldest\nof this group, regarded them with deference; but he did not belong to\ntheir secret companionship, though he was neither young nor talkative.\n\n“They've gone together ever since they were boys, they know most\neverything about the sea amon'st them,” he told me once. “They was\nalways just as you see 'em now since the memory of man.”\n\nThese ancient seafarers had houses and lands not outwardly different\nfrom other Dunnet Landing dwellings, and two of them were fathers of\nfamilies, but their true dwelling places were the sea, and the stony\nbeach that edged its familiar shore, and the fish-houses, where much\nsalt brine from the mackerel kits had soaked the very timbers into a\nstate of brown permanence and petrifaction. It had also affected the old\nfishermen's hard complexions, until one fancied that when Death claimed\nthem it could only be with the aid, not of any slender modern dart, but\nthe good serviceable harpoon of a seventeenth century woodcut.\n\nElijah Tilley was such an evasive, discouraged-looking person,\nheavy-headed, and stooping so that one could never look him in the\nface, that even after his friendly exclamation about Monroe Pennell, the\nlobster smack's skipper, and the sleepy boy, I did not venture at once\nto speak again. Mr. Tilley was carrying a small haddock in one hand, and\npresently shifted it to the other hand lest it might touch my skirt. I\nknew that my company was accepted, and we walked together a little way.\n\n“You mean to have a good supper,” I ventured to say, by way of\nfriendliness.\n\n“Goin' to have this 'ere haddock an' some o' my good baked potatoes;\nmust eat to live,” responded my companion with great pleasantness and\nopen approval. I found that I had suddenly left the forbidding coast and\ncome into the smooth little harbor of friendship.\n\n“You ain't never been up to my place,” said the old man. “Folks don't\ncome now as they used to; no, 'tain't no use to ask folks now. My poor\ndear she was a great hand to draw young company.”\n\nI remembered that Mrs. Todd had once said that this old fisherman had\nbeen sore stricken and unconsoled at the death of his wife.\n\n“I should like very much to come,” said I. “Perhaps you are going to be\nat home later on?”\n\nMr. Tilley agreed, by a sober nod, and went his way bent-shouldered and\nwith a rolling gait. There was a new patch high on the shoulder of\nhis old waistcoat, which corresponded to the renewing of the Miranda's\nmainsail down the bay, and I wondered if his own fingers, clumsy with\nmuch deep-sea fishing, had set it in.\n\n“Was there a good catch to-day?” I asked, stopping a moment. “I didn't\nhappen to be on the shore when the boats came in.”\n\n“No; all come in pretty light,” answered Mr. Tilley. “Addicks an' Bowden\nthey done the best; Abel an' me we had but a slim fare. We went out\n'arly, but not so 'arly as sometimes; looked like a poor mornin'. I got\nnine haddick, all small, and seven fish; the rest on 'em got more fish\nthan haddick. Well, I don't expect they feel like bitin' every day; we\nl'arn to humor 'em a little, an' let 'em have their way 'bout it. These\nplaguey dog-fish kind of worry 'em.” Mr. Tilley pronounced the last\nsentence with much sympathy, as if he looked upon himself as a true\nfriend of all the haddock and codfish that lived on the fishing grounds,\nand so we parted.\n\n\nLater in the afternoon I went along the beach again until I came to\nthe foot of Mr. Tilley's land, and found his rough track across the\ncobblestones and rocks to the field edge, where there was a heavy piece\nof old wreck timber, like a ship's bone, full of tree-nails. From this a\nlittle footpath, narrow with one man's treading, led up across the small\ngreen field that made Mr. Tilley's whole estate, except a straggling\npasture that tilted on edge up the steep hillside beyond the house and\nroad. I could hear the tinkle-tankle of a cow-bell somewhere among the\nspruces by which the pasture was being walked over and forested from\nevery side; it was likely to be called the wood lot before long, but the\nfield was unmolested. I could not see a bush or a brier anywhere within\nits walls, and hardly a stray pebble showed itself. This was most\nsurprising in that country of firm ledges, and scattered stones which\nall the walls that industry could devise had hardly begun to clear\naway off the land. In the narrow field I noticed some stout stakes,\napparently planted at random in the grass and among the hills of\npotatoes, but carefully painted yellow and white to match the house, a\nneat sharp-edged little dwelling, which looked strangely modern for its\nowner. I should have much sooner believed that the smart young wholesale\negg merchant of the Landing was its occupant than Mr. Tilley, since a\nman's house is really but his larger body, and expresses in a way his\nnature and character.\n\nI went up the field, following the smooth little path to the side door.\nAs for using the front door, that was a matter of great ceremony; the\nlong grass grew close against the high stone step, and a snowberry bush\nleaned over it, top-heavy with the weight of a morning-glory vine that\nhad managed to take what the fishermen might call a half hitch about\nthe door-knob. Elijah Tilley came to the side door to receive me; he was\nknitting a blue yarn stocking without looking on, and was warmly\ndressed for the season in a thick blue flannel shirt with white crockery\nbuttons, a faded waistcoat and trousers heavily patched at the knees.\nThese were not his fishing clothes. There was something delightful in\nthe grasp of his hand, warm and clean, as if it never touched anything\nbut the comfortable woolen yarn, instead of cold sea water and slippery\nfish.\n\n“What are the painted stakes for, down in the field?” I hastened to ask,\nand he came out a step or two along the path to see; and looked at the\nstakes as if his attention were called to them for the first time.\n\n“Folks laughed at me when I first bought this place an' come here to\nlive,” he explained. “They said 'twa'n't no kind of a field privilege at\nall; no place to raise anything, all full o' stones. I was aware 'twas\ngood land, an' I worked some on it--odd times when I didn't have nothin'\nelse on hand--till I cleared them loose stones all out. You never see\na prettier piece than 'tis now; now did ye? Well, as for them painted\nmarks, them's my buoys. I struck on to some heavy rocks that didn't show\nnone, but a plow'd be liable to ground on 'em, an' so I ketched holt\nan' buoyed 'em same's you see. They don't trouble me no more'n if they\nwa'n't there.”\n\n“You haven't been to sea for nothing,” I said laughing.\n\n“One trade helps another,” said Elijah with an amiable smile. “Come\nright in an' set down. Come in an' rest ye,” he exclaimed, and led the\nway into his comfortable kitchen. The sunshine poured in at the two\nfurther windows, and a cat was curled up sound asleep on the table that\nstood between them. There was a new-looking light oilcloth of a tiled\npattern on the floor, and a crockery teapot, large for a household\nof only one person, stood on the bright stove. I ventured to say that\nsomebody must be a very good housekeeper.\n\n“That's me,” acknowledged the old fisherman with frankness. “There ain't\nnobody here but me. I try to keep things looking right, same's poor dear\nleft 'em. You set down here in this chair, then you can look off an' see\nthe water. None on 'em thought I was goin' to get along alone, no way,\nbut I wa'n't goin' to have my house turned upsi' down an' all changed\nabout; no, not to please nobody. I was the only one knew just how she\nliked to have things set, poor dear, an' I said I was goin' to make\nshift, and I have made shift. I'd rather tough it out alone.” And he\nsighed heavily, as if to sigh were his familiar consolation.\n\nWe were both silent for a minute; the old man looked out the window, as\nif he had forgotten I was there.\n\n“You must miss her very much?” I said at last.\n\n“I do miss her,” he answered, and sighed again. “Folks all kep'\nrepeatin' that time would ease me, but I can't find it does. No, I miss\nher just the same every day.”\n\n“How long is it since she died?” I asked.\n\n“Eight year now, come the first of October. It don't seem near so long.\nI've got a sister that comes and stops 'long o' me a little spell,\nspring an' fall, an' odd times if I send after her. I ain't near so good\na hand to sew as I be to knit, and she's very quick to set everything\nto rights. She's a married woman with a family; her son's folks lives\nat home, an' I can't make no great claim on her time. But it makes me\na kind o' good excuse, when I do send, to help her a little; she ain't\nnone too well off. Poor dear always liked her, and we used to contrive\nour ways together. 'Tis full as easy to be alone. I set here an'\nthink it all over, an' think considerable when the weather's bad to go\noutside. I get so some days it feels as if poor dear might step right\nback into this kitchen. I keep a-watchin' them doors as if she might\nstep in to ary one. Yes, ma'am, I keep a-lookin' off an' droppin' o' my\nstitches; that's just how it seems. I can't git over losin' of her no\nway nor no how. Yes, ma'am, that's just how it seems to me.”\n\nI did not say anything, and he did not look up.\n\n“I git feelin' so sometimes I have to lay everything by an' go out door.\nShe was a sweet pretty creatur' long's she lived,” the old man added\nmournfully. “There's that little rockin' chair o' her'n, I set an'\nnotice it an' think how strange 'tis a creatur' like her should be gone\nan' that chair be here right in its old place.”\n\n\n“I wish I had known her; Mrs. Todd told me about your wife one day,” I\nsaid.\n\n“You'd have liked to come and see her; all the folks did,” said poor\nElijah. “She'd been so pleased to hear everything and see somebody new\nthat took such an int'rest. She had a kind o' gift to make it pleasant\nfor folks. I guess likely Almiry Todd told you she was a pretty woman,\nespecially in her young days; late years, too, she kep' her looks and\ncome to be so pleasant lookin'. There, 'tain't so much matter, I shall\nbe done afore a great while. No; I sha'n't trouble the fish a great\nsight more.”\n\nThe old widower sat with his head bowed over his knitting, as if he were\nhastily shortening the very thread of time. The minutes went slowly by.\nHe stopped his work and clasped his hands firmly together. I saw he had\nforgotten his guest, and I kept the afternoon watch with him. At last he\nlooked up as if but a moment had passed of his continual loneliness.\n\n“Yes, ma'am, I'm one that has seen trouble,” he said, and began to knit\nagain.\n\nThe visible tribute of his careful housekeeping, and the clean bright\nroom which had once enshrined his wife, and now enshrined her memory,\nwas very moving to me; he had no thought for any one else or for any\nother place. I began to see her myself in her home,--a delicate-looking,\nfaded little woman, who leaned upon his rough strength and affectionate\nheart, who was always watching for his boat out of this very window, and\nwho always opened the door and welcomed him when he came home.\n\n“I used to laugh at her, poor dear,” said Elijah, as if he read my\nthought. “I used to make light of her timid notions. She used to be\nfearful when I was out in bad weather or baffled about gittin' ashore.\nShe used to say the time seemed long to her, but I've found out all\nabout it now. I used to be dreadful thoughtless when I was a young man\nand the fish was bitin' well. I'd stay out late some o' them days, an'\nI expect she'd watch an' watch an' lose heart a-waitin'. My heart alive!\nwhat a supper she'd git, an' be right there watchin' from the door, with\nsomethin' over her head if 'twas cold, waitin' to hear all about it as I\ncome up the field. Lord, how I think o' all them little things!”\n\n“This was what she called the best room; in this way,” he said\npresently, laying his knitting on the table, and leading the way across\nthe front entry and unlocking a door, which he threw open with an air\nof pride. The best room seemed to me a much sadder and more empty place\nthan the kitchen; its conventionalities lacked the simple perfection of\nthe humbler room and failed on the side of poor ambition; it was only\nwhen one remembered what patient saving, and what high respect for\nsociety in the abstract go to such furnishing that the little parlor was\ninteresting at all. I could imagine the great day of certain purchases,\nthe bewildering shops of the next large town, the aspiring anxious\nwoman, the clumsy sea-tanned man in his best clothes, so eager to be\npleased, but at ease only when they were safe back in the sailboat\nagain, going down the bay with their precious freight, the hoarded money\nall spent and nothing to think of but tiller and sail. I looked at\nthe unworn carpet, the glass vases on the mantelpiece with their prim\nbunches of bleached swamp grass and dusty marsh rosemary, and I could\nread the history of Mrs. Tilley's best room from its very beginning.\n\n“You see for yourself what beautiful rugs she could make; now I'm going\nto show you her best tea things she thought so much of,” said the master\nof the house, opening the door of a shallow cupboard. “That's real\nchiny, all of it on those two shelves,” he told me proudly. “I bought\nit all myself, when we was first married, in the port of Bordeaux. There\nnever was one single piece of it broke until-- Well, I used to say,\nlong as she lived, there never was a piece broke, but long at the last I\nnoticed she'd look kind o' distressed, an' I thought 'twas 'count o' me\nboastin'. When they asked if they should use it when the folks was here\nto supper, time o' her funeral, I knew she'd want to have everything\nnice, and I said 'certain.' Some o' the women they come runnin' to me\nan' called me, while they was takin' of the chiny down, an' showed me\nthere was one o' the cups broke an' the pieces wropped in paper and\npushed way back here, corner o' the shelf. They didn't want me to go an'\nthink they done it. Poor dear! I had to put right out o' the house when\nI see that. I knowed in one minute how 'twas. We'd got so used to sayin'\n'twas all there just's I fetched it home, an' so when she broke that cup\nsomehow or 'nother she couldn't frame no words to come an' tell me. She\ncouldn't think 'twould vex me, 'twas her own hurt pride. I guess there\nwa'n't no other secret ever lay between us.”\n\nThe French cups with their gay sprigs of pink and blue, the best\ntumblers, an old flowered bowl and tea caddy, and a japanned waiter or\ntwo adorned the shelves. These, with a few daguerreotypes in a little\nsquare pile, had the closet to themselves, and I was conscious of much\npleasure in seeing them. One is shown over many a house in these days\nwhere the interest may be more complex, but not more definite.\n\n“Those were her best things, poor dear,” said Elijah as he locked the\ndoor again. “She told me that last summer before she was taken away that\nshe couldn't think o' anything more she wanted, there was everything in\nthe house, an' all her rooms was furnished pretty. I was goin' over to\nthe Port, an' inquired for errands. I used to ask her to say what she\nwanted, cost or no cost--she was a very reasonable woman, an' 'twas the\nplace where she done all but her extra shopping. It kind o' chilled me\nup when she spoke so satisfied.”\n\n“You don't go out fishing after Christmas?” I asked, as we came back to\nthe bright kitchen.\n\n“No; I take stiddy to my knitting after January sets in,” said the old\nseafarer. “'Tain't worth while, fish make off into deeper water an' you\ncan't stand no such perishin' for the sake o' what you get. I leave out\na few traps in sheltered coves an' do a little lobsterin' on fair days.\nThe young fellows braves it out, some on 'em; but, for me, I lay in\nmy winter's yarn an' set here where 'tis warm, an' knit an' take my\ncomfort. Mother learnt me once when I was a lad; she was a beautiful\nknitter herself. I was laid up with a bad knee, an' she said 'twould\ntake up my time an' help her; we was a large family. They'll buy all the\nfolks can do down here to Addicks' store. They say our Dunnet stockin's\nis gettin' to be celebrated up to Boston,--good quality o' wool an'\neven knittin' or somethin'. I've always been called a pretty hand to do\nnettin', but seines is master cheap to what they used to be when they\nwas all hand worked. I change off to nettin' long towards spring, and I\npiece up my trawls and lines and get my fishin' stuff to rights. Lobster\npots they require attention, but I make 'em up in spring weather when\nit's warm there in the barn. No; I ain't one o' them that likes to set\nan' do nothin'.”\n\n“You see the rugs, poor dear did them; she wa'n't very partial to\nknittin',” old Elijah went on, after he had counted his stitches. “Our\nrugs is beginnin' to show wear, but I can't master none o' them womanish\ntricks. My sister, she tinkers 'em up. She said last time she was here\nthat she guessed they'd last my time.”\n\n“The old ones are always the prettiest,” I said.\n\n“You ain't referrin' to the braided ones now?” answered Mr. Tilley. “You\nsee ours is braided for the most part, an' their good looks is all in\nthe beginnin'. Poor dear used to say they made an easier floor. I go\nshufflin' round the house same's if 'twas a bo't, and I always used to\nbe stubbin' up the corners o' the hooked kind. Her an' me was always\nhavin' our jokes together same's a boy an' girl. Outsiders never'd know\nnothin' about it to see us. She had nice manners with all, but to me\nthere was nobody so entertainin'. She'd take off anybody's natural\ntalk winter evenin's when we set here alone, so you'd think 'twas them\na-speakin'. There, there!”\n\nI saw that he had dropped a stitch again, and was snarling the blue yarn\nround his clumsy fingers. He handled it and threw it off at arm's length\nas if it were a cod line; and frowned impatiently, but I saw a tear\nshining on his cheek.\n\nI said that I must be going, it was growing late, and asked if I might\ncome again, and if he would take me out to the fishing grounds someday.\n\n“Yes, come any time you want to,” said my host, “'tain't so pleasant as\nwhen poor dear was here. Oh, I didn't want to lose her an' she didn't\nwant to go, but it had to be. Such things ain't for us to say; there's\nno yes an' no to it.”\n\n“You find Almiry Todd one o' the best o' women?” said Mr. Tilley as we\nparted. He was standing in the doorway and I had started off down the\nnarrow green field. “No, there ain't a better hearted woman in the State\no' Maine. I've known her from a girl. She's had the best o' mothers. You\ntell her I'm liable to fetch her up a couple or three nice good mackerel\nearly tomorrow,” he said. “Now don't let it slip your mind. Poor dear,\nshe always thought a sight o' Almiry, and she used to remind me there\nwas nobody to fish for her; but I don't rec'lect it as I ought to. I see\nyou drop a line yourself very handy now an' then.”\n\nWe laughed together like the best of friends, and I spoke again about\nthe fishing grounds, and confessed that I had no fancy for a southerly\nbreeze and a ground swell.\n\n“Nor me neither,” said the old fisherman. “Nobody likes 'em, say what\nthey may. Poor dear was disobliged by the mere sight of a bo't. Almiry's\ngot the best o' mothers, I expect you know; Mis' Blackett out to Green\nIsland; and we was always plannin' to go out when summer come; but\nthere, I couldn't pick no day's weather that seemed to suit her just\nright. I never set out to worry her neither, 'twa'n't no kind o' use;\nshe was so pleasant we couldn't have no fret nor trouble. 'Twas never\n'you dear an' you darlin'' afore folks, an' 'you divil' behind the\ndoor!”\n\nAs I looked back from the lower end of the field I saw him still\nstanding, a lonely figure in the doorway. “Poor dear,” I repeated to\nmyself half aloud; “I wonder where she is and what she knows of the\nlittle world she left. I wonder what she has been doing these eight\nyears!”\n\nI gave the message about the mackerel to Mrs. Todd.\n\n“Been visitin' with 'Lijah?” she asked with interest. “I expect you had\nkind of a dull session; he ain't the talkin' kind; dwellin' so much long\no' fish seems to make 'em lose the gift o' speech.” But when I told\nher that Mr. Tilley had been talking to me that day, she interrupted me\nquickly.\n\n“Then 'twas all about his wife, an' he can't say nothin' too pleasant\nneither. She was modest with strangers, but there ain't one o' her old\nfriends can ever make up her loss. For me, I don't want to go there no\nmore. There's some folks you miss and some folks you don't, when they're\ngone, but there ain't hardly a day I don't think o' dear Sarah Tilley.\nShe was always right there; yes, you knew just where to find her like\na plain flower. 'Lijah's worthy enough; I do esteem 'Lijah, but he's a\nploddin' man.”\n\n\n\n\nXXI. The Backward View\n\nAT LAST IT WAS the time of late summer, when the house was cool and damp\nin the morning, and all the light seemed to come through green leaves;\nbut at the first step out of doors the sunshine always laid a warm hand\non my shoulder, and the clear, high sky seemed to lift quickly as I\nlooked at it. There was no autumnal mist on the coast, nor any August\nfog; instead of these, the sea, the sky, all the long shore line and the\ninland hills, with every bush of bay and every fir-top, gained a deeper\ncolor and a sharper clearness. There was something shining in the air,\nand a kind of lustre on the water and the pasture grass,--a northern\nlook that, except at this moment of the year, one must go far to seek.\nThe sunshine of a northern summer was coming to its lovely end.\n\nThe days were few then at Dunnet Landing, and I let each of them slip\naway unwillingly as a miser spends his coins. I wished to have one of\nmy first weeks back again, with those long hours when nothing happened\nexcept the growth of herbs and the course of the sun. Once I had not\neven known where to go for a walk; now there were many delightful things\nto be done and done again, as if I were in London. I felt hurried and\nfull of pleasant engagements, and the days flew by like a handful of\nflowers flung to the sea wind.\n\nAt last I had to say good-by to all my Dunnet Landing friends, and my\nhomelike place in the little house, and return to the world in which I\nfeared to find myself a foreigner. There may be restrictions to such a\nsummer's happiness, but the ease that belongs to simplicity is charming\nenough to make up for whatever a simple life may lack, and the gifts of\npeace are not for those who live in the thick of battle.\n\nI was to take the small unpunctual steamer that went down the bay in the\nafternoon, and I sat for a while by my window looking out on the green\nherb garden, with regret for company. Mrs. Todd had hardly spoken all\nday except in the briefest and most disapproving way; it was as if we\nwere on the edge of a quarrel. It seemed impossible to take my departure\nwith anything like composure. At last I heard a footstep, and looked up\nto find that Mrs. Todd was standing at the door.\n\n“I've seen to everything now,” she told me in an unusually loud and\nbusiness-like voice. “Your trunks are on the w'arf by this time. Cap'n\nBowden he come and took 'em down himself, an' is going to see that\nthey're safe aboard. Yes, I've seen to all your 'rangements,” she\nrepeated in a gentler tone. “These things I've left on the kitchen table\nyou'll want to carry by hand; the basket needn't be returned. I guess\nI shall walk over towards the Port now an' inquire how old Mis' Edward\nCaplin is.”\n\nI glanced at my friend's face, and saw a look that touched me to the\nheart. I had been sorry enough before to go away.\n\n“I guess you'll excuse me if I ain't down there to stand around on the\nw'arf and see you go,” she said, still trying to be gruff. “Yes, I ought\nto go over and inquire for Mis' Edward Caplin; it's her third shock, and\nif mother gets in on Sunday she'll want to know just how the old lady\nis.” With this last word Mrs. Todd turned and left me as if with sudden\nthought of something she had forgotten, so that I felt sure she was\ncoming back, but presently I heard her go out of the kitchen door and\nwalk down the path toward the gate. I could not part so; I ran after\nher to say good-by, but she shook her head and waved her hand without\nlooking back when she heard my hurrying steps, and so went away down the\nstreet.\n\nWhen I went in again the little house had suddenly grown lonely, and my\nroom looked empty as it had the day I came. I and all my belongings had\ndied out of it, and I knew how it would seem when Mrs. Todd came back\nand found her lodger gone. So we die before our own eyes; so we see some\nchapters of our lives come to their natural end.\n\nI found the little packages on the kitchen table. There was a quaint\nWest Indian basket which I knew its owner had valued, and which I had\nonce admired; there was an affecting provision laid beside it for my\nseafaring supper, with a neatly tied bunch of southernwood and a twig of\nbay, and a little old leather box which held the coral pin that Nathan\nTodd brought home to give to poor Joanna.\n\n\nThere was still an hour to wait, and I went up the hill just above the\nschoolhouse and sat there thinking of things, and looking off to sea,\nand watching for the boat to come in sight. I could see Green Island,\nsmall and darkly wooded at that distance; below me were the houses of\nthe village with their apple-trees and bits of garden ground. Presently,\nas I looked at the pastures beyond, I caught a last glimpse of Mrs. Todd\nherself, walking slowly in the footpath that led along, following\nthe shore toward the Port. At such a distance one can feel the large,\npositive qualities that control a character. Close at hand, Mrs.\nTodd seemed able and warm-hearted and quite absorbed in her bustling\nindustries, but her distant figure looked mateless and appealing, with\nsomething about it that was strangely self-possessed and mysterious. Now\nand then she stooped to pick something,--it might have been her favorite\npennyroyal,--and at last I lost sight of her as she slowly crossed an\nopen space on one of the higher points of land, and disappeared again\nbehind a dark clump of juniper and the pointed firs.\n\nAs I came away on the little coastwise steamer, there was an old sea\nrunning which made the surf leap high on all the rocky shores. I stood\non deck, looking back, and watched the busy gulls agree and turn, and\nsway together down the long slopes of air, then separate hastily and\nplunge into the waves. The tide was setting in, and plenty of small fish\nwere coming with it, unconscious of the silver flashing of the great\nbirds overhead and the quickness of their fierce beaks. The sea was\nfull of life and spirit, the tops of the waves flew back as if they were\nwinged like the gulls themselves, and like them had the freedom of the\nwind. Out in the main channel we passed a bent-shouldered old fisherman\nbound for the evening round among his lobster traps. He was toiling\nalong with short oars, and the dory tossed and sank and tossed again\nwith the steamer's waves. I saw that it was old Elijah Tilley, and\nthough we had so long been strangers we had come to be warm friends, and\nI wished that he had waited for one of his mates, it was such hard work\nto row along shore through rough seas and tend the traps alone. As we\npassed I waved my hand and tried to call to him, and he looked up and\nanswered my farewells by a solemn nod. The little town, with the tall\nmasts of its disabled schooners in the inner bay, stood high above the\nflat sea for a few minutes then it sank back into the uniformity of the\ncoast, and became indistinguishable from the other towns that looked as\nif they were crumbled on the furzy-green stoniness of the shore.\n\nThe small outer islands of the bay were covered among the ledges with\nturf that looked as fresh as the early grass; there had been some days\nof rain the week before, and the darker green of the sweet-fern was\nscattered on all the pasture heights. It looked like the beginning of\nsummer ashore, though the sheep, round and warm in their winter wool,\nbetrayed the season of the year as they went feeding along the slopes\nin the low afternoon sunshine. Presently the wind began to blow and we\nstruck out seaward to double the long sheltering headland of the cape,\nand when I looked back again, the islands and the headland had run\ntogether and Dunnet Landing and all its coasts were lost to sight.",
