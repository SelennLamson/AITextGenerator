Why may it not be done?\n    Dark clouds bring waters, when the bright bring none.\n    Yea, dark or bright, if they their silver drops\n    Cause to descend, the earth, by yielding crops,\n    Gives praise to both, and carpeth not at either,\n    But treasures up the fruit they yield together;\n    Yea, so commixes both, that in her fruit\n    None can distinguish this from that:  they suit\n    Her well when hungry; but, if she be full,\n    She spews out both, and makes their blessings null.\n\n    You see the ways the fisherman doth take\n    To catch the fish; what engines doth he make?\n    Behold how he engageth all his wits;\n    Also his snares, lines, angles, hooks, and nets;\n    Yet fish there be, that neither hook, nor line,\n    Nor snare, nor net, nor engine can make thine:\n    They must be groped for, and be tickled too,\n    Or they will not be catch'd, whate'er you do.\n\n    How does the fowler seek to catch his game\n    By divers means!  all which one cannot name:\n    His guns, his nets, his lime-twigs, light, and bell:\n    He creeps, he goes, he stands; yea, who can tell\n    Of all his postures?  Yet there's none of these\n    Will make him master of what fowls he please.\n    Yea, he must pipe and whistle to catch this,\n    Yet, if he does so, that bird he will miss.\n\n    If that a pearl may in a toad's head dwell,\n    And may be found too in an oyster-shell;\n    If things that promise nothing do contain\n    What better is than gold; who will disdain,\n    That have an inkling of it, there to look,\n    That they may find it?  Now, my little book,\n    (Though void of all these paintings that may make\n    It with this or the other man to take)\n    Is not without those things that do excel\n    What do in brave but empty notions dwell.\n\n{5} 'Well, yet I am not fully satisfied,\n    That this your book will stand, when soundly tried.'\n    Why, what's the matter?  'It is dark.'  What though?\n    'But it is feigned.'  What of that?  I trow?\n    Some men, by feigned words, as dark as mine,\n    Make truth to spangle and its rays to shine.\n\n    'But they want solidness.'  Speak, man, thy mind.\n    'They drown the weak; metaphors make us blind.'\n\n    Solidity, indeed, becomes the pen\n    Of him that writeth things divine to men;\n    But must I needs want solidness, because\n    By metaphors I speak?  Were not God's laws,\n    His gospel laws, in olden times held forth\n    By types, shadows, and metaphors?  Yet loth\n    Will any sober man be to find fault\n    With them, lest he be found for to assault\n    The highest wisdom.  No, he rather stoops,\n    And seeks to find out what by pins and loops,\n    By calves and sheep, by heifers and by rams,\n    By birds and herbs, and by the blood of lambs,\n    God speaketh to him; and happy is he\n    That finds the light and grace that in them be.\n\n{6} Be not too forward, therefore, to conclude\n    That I want solidness--that I am rude;\n    All things solid in show not solid be;\n    All things in parables despise not we;\n    Lest things most hurtful lightly we receive,\n    And things that good are, of our souls bereave.\n\n    My dark and cloudy words, they do but hold\n    The truth, as cabinets enclose the gold.\n\n    The prophets used much by metaphors\n    To set forth truth; yea, who so considers Christ,\n    his apostles too, shall plainly see,\n    That truths to this day in such mantles be.\n\n    Am I afraid to say, that holy writ,\n    Which for its style and phrase puts down all wit,\n    Is everywhere so full of all these things--\n    Dark figures, allegories?  Yet there springs\n    From that same book that lustre, and those rays\n    Of light, that turn our darkest nights to days.\n\n{7} Come, let my carper to his life now look,\n    And find there darker lines than in my book\n    He findeth any; yea, and let him know,\n    That in his best things there are worse lines too.\n\n    May we but stand before impartial men,\n    To his poor one I dare adventure ten,\n    That they will take my meaning in these lines\n    Far better than his lies in silver shrines.\n    Come, truth, although in swaddling clouts, I find,\n    Informs the judgement, rectifies the mind;\n    Pleases the understanding, makes the will\n    Submit; the memory too it doth fill\n    With what doth our imaginations please;\n    Likewise it tends our troubles to appease.\n\n    Sound words, I know, Timothy is to use,\n    And old wives' fables he is to refuse;\n    But yet grave Paul him nowhere did forbid\n    The use of parables; in which lay hid\n    That gold, those pearls, and precious stones that were\n    Worth digging for, and that with greatest care.\n\n    Let me add one word more.  O man of God,\n    Art thou offended?  Dost thou wish I had\n    Put forth my matter in another dress?\n    Or, that I had in things been more express?\n    Three things let me propound; then I submit\n    To those that are my betters, as is fit.\n\n{8} 1.  I find not that I am denied the use\n    Of this my method, so I no abuse\n    Put on the words, things, readers; or be rude\n    In handling figure or similitude,\n    In application; but, all that I may,\n    Seek the advance of truth this or that way\n    Denied, did I say?  Nay, I have leave\n    (Example too, and that from them that have\n    God better pleased, by their words or ways,\n    Than any man that breatheth now-a-days)\n    Thus to express my mind, thus to declare\n    Things unto thee that excellentest are.\n\n    2.  I find that men (as high as trees) will write\n    Dialogue-wise; yet no man doth them slight\n    For writing so:  indeed, if they abuse\n    Truth, cursed be they, and the craft they use\n    To that intent; but yet let truth be free\n    To make her sallies upon thee and me,\n    Which way it pleases God; for who knows how,\n    Better than he that taught us first to plough,\n    To guide our mind and pens for his design?\n    And he makes base things usher in divine.\n\n    3.  I find that holy writ in many places\n    Hath semblance with this method, where the cases\n    Do call for one thing, to set forth another;\n    Use it I may, then, and yet nothing smother\n    Truth's golden beams:  nay, by this method may\n    Make it cast forth its rays as light as day.\n    And now before I do put up my pen,\n    I'll shew the profit of my book, and then\n    Commit both thee and it unto that Hand\n    That pulls the strong down, and makes weak ones stand.\n\n    This book it chalketh out before thine eyes\n    The man that seeks the everlasting prize;\n    It shews you whence he comes, whither he goes;\n    What he leaves undone, also what he does;\n    It also shows you how he runs and runs,\n    Till he unto the gate of glory comes.\n\n{9} It shows, too, who set out for life amain,\n    As if the lasting crown they would obtain;\n    Here also you may see the reason why\n    They lose their labour, and like fools do die.\n\n    This book will make a traveller of thee,\n    If by its counsel thou wilt ruled be;\n    It will direct thee to the Holy Land,\n    If thou wilt its directions understand:\n    Yea, it will make the slothful active be;\n    The blind also delightful things to see.\n\n    Art thou for something rare and profitable?\n    Wouldest thou see a truth within a fable?\n    Art thou forgetful?  Wouldest thou remember\n    From New-Year's day to the last of December?\n    Then read my fancies; they will stick like burs,\n    And may be, to the helpless, comforters.\n\n    This book is writ in such a dialect\n    As may the minds of listless men affect:\n    It seems a novelty, and yet contains\n    Nothing but sound and honest gospel strains.\n    Wouldst thou divert thyself from melancholy?\n    Wouldst thou be pleasant, yet be far from folly?\n    Wouldst thou read riddles, and their explanation?\n    Or else be drowned in thy contemplation?\n    Dost thou love picking meat?  Or wouldst thou see\n    A man in the clouds, and hear him speak to thee?\n    Wouldst thou be in a dream, and yet not sleep?\n    Or wouldst thou in a moment laugh and weep?\n    Wouldest thou lose thyself and catch no harm,\n    And find thyself again without a charm?\n    Wouldst read thyself, and read thou knowest not what,\n    And yet know whether thou art blest or not,\n\n    By reading the same lines?  Oh, then come hither,\n    And lay my book, thy head, and heart together.\n\n\nJOHN BUNYAN.\n\n\n\nTHE PILGRIM'S PROGRESS\n\nIn the Similitude of a Dream\n\n\n{10} As I walked through the wilderness of this world, I lighted\non a certain place where was a Den, and I laid me down in that\nplace to sleep: and, as I slept, I dreamed a dream.  I dreamed,\nand behold, I saw a man clothed with rags, standing in a certain\nplace, with his face from his own house, a book in his hand, and\na great burden upon his back.  [Isa. 64:6; Luke 14:33; Ps. 38:4;\nHab. 2:2; Acts 16:30,31] I looked, and saw him open the book,\nand read therein; and, as he read, he wept, and trembled; and, not\nbeing able longer to contain, he brake out with a lamentable cry,\nsaying, \"What shall I do?\"  [Acts 2:37]\n\n{11} In this plight, therefore, he went home and refrained himself\nas long as he could, that his wife and children should not perceive\nhis distress; but he could not be silent long, because that his\ntrouble increased.  Wherefore at length he brake his mind to his\nwife and children; and thus he began to talk to them:  O my dear\nwife, said he, and you the children of my bowels, I, your dear\nfriend, am in myself undone by reason of a burden that lieth hard\nupon me; moreover, I am for certain informed that this our city\nwill be burned with fire from heaven; in which fearful overthrow,\nboth myself, with thee my wife, and you my sweet babes, shall\nmiserably come to ruin, except (the which yet I see not) some way\nof escape can be found, whereby we may be delivered.  At this his\nrelations were sore amazed; not for that they believed that what\nhe had said to them was true, but because they thought that some\nfrenzy distemper had got into his head; therefore, it drawing\ntowards night, and they hoping that sleep might settle his brains,\nwith all haste they got him to bed.  But the night was as troublesome\nto him as the day; wherefore, instead of sleeping, he spent it in\nsighs and tears.  So, when the morning was come, they would know\nhow he did.  He told them, Worse and worse:  he also set to talking\nto them again; but they began to be hardened.  They also thought\nto drive away his distemper by harsh and surly carriages to\nhim; sometimes they would deride, sometimes they would chide, and\nsometimes they would quite neglect him.  Wherefore he began to\nretire himself to his chamber, to pray for and pity them, and also\nto condole his own misery; he would also walk solitarily in the\nfields, sometimes reading, and sometimes praying:  and thus for\nsome days he spent his time.\n\n{12} Now, I saw, upon a time, when he was walking in the fields,\nthat he was, as he was wont, reading in his book, and greatly\ndistressed in his mind; and, as he read, he burst out, as he had\ndone before, crying, \"What shall I do to be saved?\"\n\n{13} I saw also that he looked this way and that way, as if he\nwould run; yet he stood still, because, as I perceived, he could\nnot tell which way to go.  I looked then, and saw a man named\nEvangelist coming to him and asked, Wherefore dost thou cry?  [Job\n33:23]\n\n{14} He answered, Sir, I perceive by the book in my hand, that\nI am condemned to die, and after that to come to judgement [Heb.\n9:27]; and I find that I am not willing to do the first [Job 16:21],\nnor able to do the second.  [Ezek. 22:14]\n\nCHRISTIAN no sooner leaves the World but meets EVANGELIST, who\nlovingly him greets With tidings of another:  and doth show Him\nhow to mount to that from this below.\n\n{15} Then said Evangelist, Why not willing to die, since this life\nis attended with so many evils?  The man answered, Because I fear\nthat this burden is upon my back will sink me lower than the grave,\nand I shall fall into Tophet.  [Isa. 30:33] And, Sir, if I be not\nfit to go to prison, I am not fit, I am sure, to go to judgement,\nand from thence to execution; and the thoughts of these things make\nme cry.\n\n{16} Then said Evangelist, If this be thy condition, why standest\nthou still?  He answered, Because I know not whither to go.  Then\nhe gave him a parchment roll, and there was written within, Flee\nfrom the wrath to come.  [Matt. 3.7]\n\n{17} The man therefore read it, and looking upon Evangelist\nvery carefully, said, Whither must I fly?  Then said Evangelist,\npointing with his finger over a very wide field, Do you see yonder\nwicket-gate?  [Matt. 7:13,14] The man said, No.  Then said the other,\nDo you see yonder shining light?  [Ps. 119:105; 2 Pet. 1:19] He\nsaid, I think I do.  Then said Evangelist, Keep that light in your\neye, and go up directly thereto:  so shalt thou see the gate; at\nwhich, when thou knockest, it shall be told thee what thou shalt\ndo.\n\n{18} So I saw in my dream that the man began to run.\n\nNow, he had not run far from his own door, but his wife and children,\nperceiving it, began to cry after him to return; but the man put\nhis fingers in his ears, and ran on, crying, Life!  life!  eternal\nlife!  [Luke 14:26] So he looked not behind him, but fled towards\nthe middle of the plain.  [Gen. 19:17]\n\n{19} The neighbours also came out to see him run [Jer. 20:10];\nand, as he ran, some mocked, others threatened, and some cried\nafter him to return; and, among those that did so, there were two\nthat resolved to fetch him back by force.  The name of the one was\nObstinate and the name of the other Pliable.  Now, by this time,\nthe man was got a good distance from them; but, however, they were\nresolved to pursue him, which they did, and in a little time they\novertook him.  Then said the man, Neighbours, wherefore are ye come?\nThey said, To persuade you to go back with us.  But he said, That\ncan by no means be; you dwell, said he, in the City of Destruction,\nthe place also where I was born:  I see it to be so; and, dying\nthere, sooner or later, you will sink lower than the grave, into\na place that burns with fire and brimstone:  be content, good\nneighbours, and go along with me.\n\n{20} OBST. What!  said Obstinate, and leave our friends and our\ncomforts behind us?\n\nCHR. Yes, said Christian, for that was his name, because that ALL\nwhich you shall forsake is not worthy to be compared with a little\nof that which I am seeking to enjoy [2 Cor. 4:18]; and, if you\nwill go along with me, and hold it, you shall fare as I myself;\nfor there, where I go, is enough and to spare.  [Luke 15:17] Come\naway, and prove my words.\n\n{21} OBST. What are the things you seek, since you leave all the\nworld to find them?\n\nCHR. I seek an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth\nnot away [1 Pet. 1:4], and it is laid up in heaven, and safe there\n[Heb. 11:16], to be bestowed, at the time appointed, on them that\ndiligently seek it.  Read it so, if you will, in my book.\n\nOBST. Tush!  said Obstinate, away with your book; will you go back\nwith us or no?\n\nCHR. No, not I, said the other, because I have laid my hand to the\nplough.  [Luke 9:62]\n\n{22} OBST. Come, then, neighbour Pliable, let us turn again,\nand go home without him; there is a company of these crazy-headed\ncoxcombs, that, when they take a fancy by the end, are wiser in\ntheir own eyes than seven men that can render a reason.  [Prov.\n26:16]\n\nPLI. Then said Pliable, Don't revile; if what the good Christian\nsays is true, the things he looks after are better than ours:  my\nheart inclines to go with my neighbour.\n\nOBST. What!  more fools still!  Be ruled by me, and go back; who\nknows whither such a brain-sick fellow will lead you?  Go back, go\nback, and be wise.\n\n{23} CHR. Nay, but do thou come with thy neighbour, Pliable; there\nare such things to be had which I spoke of, and many more glorious\nbesides.  If you believe not me, read here in this book; and for\nthe truth of what is expressed therein, behold, all is confirmed\nby the blood of Him that made it.  [Heb. 9:17-22; 13:20]\n\nPLI. Well, neighbour Obstinate, said Pliable, I begin to come to a\npoint; I intend to go along with this good man, and to cast in my\nlot with him:  but, my good companion, do you know the way to this\ndesired place?\n\n{24} CHR. I am directed by a man, whose name is Evangelist, to\nspeed me to a little gate that is before us, where we shall receive\ninstructions about the way.\n\nPLI. Come, then, good neighbour, let us be going.  Then they went\nboth together.\n\nOBST. And I will go back to my place, said Obstinate; I will be no\ncompanion of such misled, fantastical fellows.\n\n{25} Now, I saw in my dream, that when Obstinate was gone back,\nChristian and Pliable went talking over the plain; and thus they\nbegan their discourse.\n\n{26} CHR. Come, neighbour Pliable, how do you do?  I am glad you\nare persuaded to go along with me.  Had even Obstinate himself\nbut felt what I have felt of the powers and terrors of what is yet\nunseen, he would not thus lightly have given us the back.\n\nPLI. Come, neighbour Christian, since there are none but us two\nhere, tell me now further what the things are, and how to be enjoyed,\nwhither we are going.\n\n{27} CHR. I can better conceive of them with my mind, than speak\nof them with my tongue.  God's things unspeakable:  but yet, since\nyou are desirous to know, I will read of them in my book.\n\nPLI. And do you think that the words of your book are certainly\ntrue?\n\nCHR. Yes, verily; for it was made by Him that cannot lie.  [Titus\n1:2]\n\nPLI. Well said; what things are they?\n\nCHR. There is an endless kingdom to be inhabited, and everlasting\nlife to be given us, that we may inhabit that kingdom for ever.\n[Isa. 45:17; John 10:28,29]\n\nPLI. Well said; and what else?\n\nCHR. There are crowns and glory to be given us, and garments that\nwill make us shine like the sun in the firmament of heaven.  [2\nTim.  4:8; Rev. 3:4; Matt. 13:43]\n\nPLI. This is very pleasant; and what else?\n\nCHR. There shall be no more crying, nor Sorrow:  for He that is\nowner of the place will wipe all tears from our eyes.  [Isa. 25.6-8;\nRev. 7:17, 21:4]\n\n{28} PLI. And what company shall we have there?\n\nCHR. There we shall be with seraphims and cherubims, creatures that\nwill dazzle your eyes to look on them.  [Isa. 6:2] There also you\nshall meet with thousands and ten thousands that have gone before\nus to that place; none of them are hurtful, but loving and holy;\nevery one walking in the sight of God, and standing in his presence\nwith acceptance for ever.  [1 Thess. 4:16,17; Rev. 5:11] In a\nword, there we shall see the elders with their golden crowns [Rev.\n4:4], there we shall see the holy virgins with their golden harps\n[Rev. 14:1-5], there we shall see men that by the world were cut\nin pieces, burnt in flames, eaten of beasts, drowned in the seas,\nfor the love that they bare to the Lord of the place, all well, and\nclothed with immortality as with a garment.  [John 12:25; 2 Cor.\n5:4]\n\nPLI. The hearing of this is enough to ravish one's heart.  But are\nthese things to be enjoyed?  How shall we get to be sharers thereof?\n\nCHR. The Lord, the Governor of the country, hath recorded that in\nthis book; the substance of which is, If we be truly willing to\nhave it, he will bestow it upon us freely.\n\nPLI. Well, my good companion, glad am I to hear of these things:\ncome on, let us mend our pace.\n\nCHR. I cannot go so fast as I would, by reason of this burden that\nis on my back.\n\n{29} Now I saw in my dream, that just as they had ended this talk\nthey drew near to a very miry slough, that was in the midst of the\nplain; and they, being heedless, did both fall suddenly into the\nbog.  The name of the slough was Despond.  Here, therefore, they\nwallowed for a time, being grievously bedaubed with the dirt; and\nChristian, because of the burden that was on his back, began to\nsink in the mire.\n\n{30} PLI. Then said Pliable; Ah!  neighbour Christian, where are\nyou now?\n\nCHR. Truly, said Christian, I do not know.\n\nPLI. At this Pliable began to be offended, and angrily said to his\nfellow, Is this the happiness you have told me all this while of?\nIf we have such ill speed at our first setting out, what may we\nexpect betwixt this and our journey's end?  May I get out again\nwith my life, you shall possess the brave country alone for me.\nAnd, with that, he gave a desperate struggle or two, and got out\nof the mire on that side of the slough which was next to his own\nhouse:  so away he went, and Christian saw him no more.\n\n{31} Wherefore Christian was left to tumble in the Slough of Despond\nalone:  but still he endeavoured to struggle to that side of the\nslough that was still further from his own house, and next to the\nwicket-gate; the which he did, but could not get out, because of\nthe burden that was upon his back:  but I beheld in my dream, that\na man came to him, whose name was Help, and asked him, What he did\nthere?\n\nCHR. Sir, said Christian, I was bid go this way by a man called\nEvangelist, who directed me also to yonder gate, that I might escape\nthe wrath to come; and as I was going thither I fell in here.\n\n{32} HELP. But why did not you look for the steps?\n\nCHR. Fear followed me so hard, that I fled the next way, and fell\nin.\n\nHELP. Then said he, Give me thy hand:  so he gave him his hand, and\nhe drew him out, and set him upon sound ground, and bid him go on\nhis way.  [Ps. 40:2]\n\n{33} Then I stepped to him that plucked him out, and said,\nSir, wherefore, since over this place is the way from the City of\nDestruction to yonder gate, is it that this plat is not mended,\nthat poor travellers might go thither with more security?  And he\nsaid unto me, This miry slough is such a place as cannot be mended;\nit is the descent whither the scum and filth that attends conviction\nfor sin doth continually run, and therefore it is called the Slough\nof Despond; for still, as the sinner is awakened about his lost\ncondition, there ariseth in his soul many fears, and doubts, and\ndiscouraging apprehensions, which all of them get together, and\nsettle in this place.  And this is the reason of the badness of\nthis ground.\n\n{34} It is not the pleasure of the King that this place should remain\nso bad.  [Isa. 35:3,4] His labourers also have, by the direction\nof His Majesty's surveyors, been for above these sixteen hundred\nyears employed about this patch of ground, if perhaps it might have\nbeen mended:  yea, and to my knowledge, said he, here have been\nswallowed up at least twenty thousand cart-loads, yea, millions of\nwholesome instructions, that have at all seasons been brought from\nall places of the King's dominions, and they that can tell, say\nthey are the best materials to make good ground of the place; if\nso be, it might have been mended, but it is the Slough of Despond\nstill, and so will be when they have done what they can.\n\n{35} True, there are, by the direction of the Law-giver, certain\ngood and substantial steps, placed even through the very midst of\nthis slough; but at such time as this place doth much spew out its\nfilth, as it doth against change of weather, these steps are hardly\nseen; or, if they be, men, through the dizziness of their heads,\nstep beside, and then they are bemired to purpose, notwithstanding\nthe steps be there; but the ground is good when they are once got\nin at the gate.  [1 Sam. 12:23]\n\n{36} Now, I saw in my dream, that by this time Pliable was got home\nto his house again, so that his neighbours came to visit him; and\nsome of them called him wise man for coming back, and some called\nhim fool for hazarding himself with Christian:  others again did mock\nat his cowardliness; saying, Surely, since you began to venture, I\nwould not have been so base to have given out for a few difficulties.\nSo Pliable sat sneaking among them.  But at last he got more\nconfidence, and then they all turned their tales, and began to\nderide poor Christian behind his back.  And thus much concerning\nPliable.\n\n{37} Now, as Christian was walking solitarily by himself, he espied\none afar off, come crossing over the field to meet him; and their\nhap was to meet just as they were crossing the way of each other.\nThe gentleman's name that met him was Mr. Worldly Wiseman, he dwelt\nin the town of Carnal Policy, a very great town, and also hard by\nfrom whence Christian came.  This man, then, meeting with Christian,\nand having some inkling of him,--for Christian's setting forth\nfrom the City of Destruction was much noised abroad, not only in\nthe town where he dwelt, but also it began to be the town talk in\nsome other places,--Mr. Worldly Wiseman, therefore, having some\nguess of him, by beholding his laborious going, by observing his\nsighs and groans, and the like, began thus to enter into some talk\nwith Christian.\n\n{38} WORLD. How now, good fellow, whither away after this burdened\nmanner?\n\nCHR. A burdened manner, indeed, as ever, I think, poor creature\nhad!  And whereas you ask me, Whither away?  I tell you, Sir, I am\ngoing to yonder wicket-gate before me; for there, as I am informed,\nI shall be put into a way to be rid of my heavy burden.\n\nWORLD. Hast thou a wife and children?\n\nCHR. Yes; but I am so laden with this burden that I cannot take\nthat pleasure in them as formerly; methinks I am as if I had none.\n[1 Cor 7:29]\n\nWORLD. Wilt thou hearken unto me if I give thee counsel?\n\nCHR. If it be good, I will; for I stand in need of good counsel.\n\n{39} WORLD. I would advise thee, then, that thou with all speed get\nthyself rid of thy burden; for thou wilt never be settled in thy\nmind till then; nor canst thou enjoy the benefits of the blessing\nwhich God hath bestowed upon thee till then.\n\nCHR. That is that which I seek for, even to be rid of this heavy\nburden; but get it off myself, I cannot; nor is there any man in\nour country that can take it off my shoulders; therefore am I going\nthis way, as I told you, that I may be rid of my burden.\n\nWORLD. Who bid thee go this way to be rid of thy burden?\n\nCHR. A man that appeared to me to be a very great and honourable\nperson; his name, as I remember, is Evangelist.\n\n{40} WORLD. I beshrew him for his counsel!  there is not a more\ndangerous and troublesome way in the world than is that unto which\nhe hath directed thee; and that thou shalt find, if thou wilt be\nruled by his counsel.  Thou hast met with something, as I perceive,\nalready; for I see the dirt of the Slough of Despond is upon thee;\nbut that slough is the beginning of the sorrows that do attend\nthose that go on in that way.  Hear me, I am older than thou; thou\nart like to meet with, in the way which thou goest, wearisomeness,\npainfulness, hunger, perils, nakedness, sword, lions, dragons,\ndarkness, and, in a word, death, and what not!  These things are\ncertainly true, having been confirmed by many testimonies.  And why\nshould a man so carelessly cast away himself, by giving heed to a\nstranger?\n\nCHR. Why, Sir, this burden upon my back is more terrible to me than\nall these things which you have mentioned; nay, methinks I care\nnot what I meet with in the way, if so be I can also meet with\ndeliverance from my burden.\n\n{41} WORLD. How camest thou by the burden at first?\n\nCHR. By reading this book in my hand.\n\nWORLD. I thought so; and it is happened unto thee as to other weak\nmen, who, meddling with things too high for them, do suddenly fall\ninto thy distractions; which distractions do not only unman men, as\nthine, I perceive, have done thee, but they run them upon desperate\nventures to obtain they know not what.\n\nCHR. I know what I would obtain; it is ease for my heavy burden.\n\n{42} WORLD. But why wilt thou seek for ease this way, seeing so\nmany dangers attend it?  especially since, hadst thou but patience\nto hear me, I could direct thee to the obtaining of what thou desirest,\nwithout the dangers that thou in this way wilt run thyself into;\nyea, and the remedy is at hand.  Besides, I will add, that instead\nof those dangers, thou shalt meet with much safety, friendship,\nand content.\n\nCHR. Pray, Sir, open this secret to me.\n\n{43} WORLD. Why, in yonder village--the village is named Morality--\nthere dwells a gentleman whose name is Legality, a very judicious\nman, and a man of very good name, that has skill to help men\noff with such burdens as thine are from their shoulders:  yea, to\nmy knowledge, he hath done a great deal of good this way; ay, and\nbesides, he hath skill to cure those that are somewhat crazed in\ntheir wits with their burdens.  To him, as I said, thou mayest go,\nand be helped presently.  His house is not quite a mile from this\nplace, and if he should not be at home himself, he hath a pretty\nyoung man to his son, whose name is Civility, that can do it (to\nspeak on) as well as the old gentleman himself; there, I say, thou\nmayest be eased of thy burden; and if thou art not minded to go\nback to thy former habitation, as, indeed, I would not wish thee,\nthou mayest send for thy wife and children to thee to this village,\nwhere there are houses now stand empty, one of which thou mayest\nhave at reasonable rates; provision is there also cheap and good;\nand that which will make thy life the more happy is, to be sure,\nthere thou shalt live by honest neighbours, in credit and good\nfashion.\n\n{44} Now was Christian somewhat at a stand; but presently he concluded,\nif this be true, which this gentleman hath said, my wisest course\nis to take his advice; and with that he thus further spoke.\n\n{45} CHR. Sir, which is my way to this honest man's house?\n\nWORLD. Do you see yonder hill?\n\nCHR. Yes, very well.\n\nWORLD. By that hill you must go, and the first house you come at\nis his.\n\n{46} So Christian turned out of his way to go to Mr. Legality's\nhouse for help; but, behold, when he was got now hard by the hill,\nit seemed so high, and also that side of it that was next the\nwayside did hang so much over, that Christian was afraid to venture\nfurther, lest the hill should fall on his head; wherefore there he\nstood still and wotted not what to do.  Also his burden now seemed\nheavier to him than while he was in his way.  There came also\nflashes of fire out of the hill, that made Christian afraid that\nhe should be burned.  [Ex. 19:16, 18] Here, therefore, he sweat\nand did quake for fear.  [Heb. 12:21]\n\nWhen Christians unto carnal men give ear, Out of their way they\ngo, and pay for 't dear; For Master Worldly Wiseman can but shew\nA saint the way to bondage and to woe.\n\n{47} And now he began to be sorry that he had taken Mr. Worldly\nWiseman's counsel.  And with that he saw Evangelist coming to meet\nhim; at the sight also of whom he began to blush for shame.  So\nEvangelist drew nearer and nearer; and coming up to him, he looked\nupon him with a severe and dreadful countenance, and thus began to\nreason with Christian.\n\n{48} EVAN. What dost thou here, Christian?  said he:  at which\nwords Christian knew not what to answer; wherefore at present he\nstood speechless before him.  Then said Evangelist further, Art not\nthou the man that I found crying without the walls of the City of\nDestruction?\n\nCHR. Yes, dear Sir, I am the man.\n\nEVAN. Did not I direct thee the way to the little wicket-gate?\n\nCHR. Yes, dear Sir, said Christian.\n\nEVAN. How is it, then, that thou art so quickly turned aside?  for\nthou art now out of the way.\n\n{49} CHR. I met with a gentleman so soon as I had got over the\nSlough of Despond, who persuaded me that I might, in the village\nbefore me, find a man that would take off my burden.\n\nEVAN. What was he?\n\nCHR. He looked like a gentleman, and talked much to me, and got me\nat last to yield; so I came hither; but when I beheld this hill, and\nhow it hangs over the way, I suddenly made a stand lest it should\nfall on my head.\n\nEVAN. What said that gentleman to you?\n\nCHR. Why, he asked me whither I was going, and I told him.\n\nEVAN. And what said he then?\n\nCHR. He asked me if I had a family?  And I told him.  But, said I,\nI am so loaden with the burden that is on my back, that I cannot\ntake pleasure in them as formerly.\n\nEVAN. And what said he then?\n\n{50} CHR. He bid me with speed get rid of my burden; and I told him\nthat it was ease that I sought.  And said I, I am therefore going\nto yonder gate, to receive further direction how I may get to the\nplace of deliverance.  So he said that he would shew me a better\nway, and short, not so attended with difficulties as the way,\nSir, that you set me in; which way, said he, will direct you to\na gentleman's house that hath skill to take off these burdens, so\nI believed him, and turned out of that way into this, if haply I\nmight be soon eased of my burden.  But when I came to this place,\nand beheld things as they are, I stopped for fear (as I said) of\ndanger:  but I now know not what to do.\n\n{51} EVAN. Then, said Evangelist, stand still a little, that I\nmay show thee the words of God.  So he stood trembling.  Then said\nEvangelist, \"See that ye refuse not him that speaketh.  For if they\nescaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall\nnot we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven.\"\n[Heb. 12:25] He said, moreover, \"Now the just shall live by faith:\nbut if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.\"\n[Heb. 10:38] He also did thus apply them:  Thou art the man that\nart running into this misery; thou hast begun to reject the counsel\nof the Most High, and to draw back thy foot from the way of peace,\neven almost to the hazarding of thy perdition.\n\n{52} Then Christian fell down at his feet as dead, crying, \"Woe\nis me, for I am undone!\"  At the sight of which Evangelist caught\nhim by the right hand, saying, \"All manner of sin and blasphemies\nshall be forgiven unto men.\"  [Matt. 12:31, Mark 3:28] \"Be not\nfaithless, but believing.\"  [John 20:27] Then did Christian again a\nlittle revive, and stood up trembling, as at first, before Evangelist.\n\n{53} Then Evangelist proceeded, saying, Give more earnest heed to\nthe things that I shall tell thee of.  I will now show thee who it\nwas that deluded thee, and who it was also to whom he sent thee.\n--The man that met thee is one Worldly Wiseman, and rightly is he\nso called; partly, because he savoureth only the doctrine of this\nworld, [1 John 4:5] (therefore he always goes to the town of Morality\nto church):  and partly because he loveth that doctrine best, for\nit saveth him best from the cross.  [Gal 6:12] And because he is\nof this carnal temper, therefore he seeketh to pervert my ways,\nthough right.  Now there are three things in this man's counsel,\nthat thou must utterly abhor.\n\n1.  His turning thee out of the way.  2.  His labouring to render\nthe cross odious to thee.  And, 3.  His setting thy feet in that\nway that leadeth unto the administration of death.\n\n{54} First, Thou must abhor his turning thee out of the way; and\nthine own consenting thereunto:  because this is to reject the\ncounsel of God for the sake of the counsel of a Worldly Wiseman.\nThe Lord says, \"Strive to enter in at the strait gate\" [Luke 13:24],\nthe gate to which I sent thee; for \"strait is the gate that leadeth\nunto life, and few there be that find it.\"  [Matt. 7:14] From this\nlittle wicket-gate, and from the way thereto, hath this wicked man\nturned thee, to the bringing of thee almost to destruction; hate,\ntherefore, his turning thee out of the way, and abhor thyself for\nhearkening to him.\n\n{55} Secondly, Thou must abhor his labouring to render the cross\nodious unto thee; for thou art to prefer it \"before the treasures\nin Egypt.\"  [Heb. 11:25,26] Besides the King of glory hath told\nthee, that he that \"will save his life shall lose it.\"  [Mark 8:35;\nJohn 12:25; Matt. 10:39] And, \"He that cometh after me, and hateth\nnot his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren,\nand sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.\"\n[Luke 14:26] I say, therefore, for man to labour to persuade thee,\nthat that shall be thy death, without which, THE TRUTH hath said,\nthou canst not have eternal life; this doctrine thou must abhor.\n\n{56} Thirdly, Thou must hate his setting of thy feet in the way\nthat leadeth to the ministration of death.  And for this thou must\nconsider to whom he sent thee, and also how unable that person was\nto deliver thee from thy burden.\n\n{57} He to whom thou wast sent for ease, being by name Legality,\nis the son of the bond-woman which now is, and is in bondage with\nher children [Gal 4:21-27]; and is, in a mystery, this Mount Sinai,\nwhich thou hast feared will fall on thy head.  Now, if she, with\nher children, are in bondage, how canst thou expect by them to be\nmade free?  This Legality, therefore, is not able to set thee free\nfrom thy burden.  No man was as yet ever rid of his burden by him;\nno, nor ever is like to be:  ye cannot be justified by the works\nof the law; for by the deeds of the law no man living can be rid\nof his burden:  therefore, Mr. Worldly Wiseman is an alien, and\nMr. Legality is a cheat; and for his son Civility, notwithstanding\nhis simpering looks, he is but a hypocrite and cannot help thee.\nBelieve me, there is nothing in all this noise, that thou hast\nheard of these sottish men, but a design to beguile thee of thy\nsalvation, by turning thee from the way in which I had set thee.\nAfter this, Evangelist called aloud to the heavens for confirmation\nof what he had said:  and with that there came words and fire out\nof the mountain under which poor Christian stood, that made the\nhair of his flesh stand up.  The words were thus pronounced:  'As\nmany as are of the works of the law are under the curse; for it\nis written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things\nwhich are written in the book of the law to do them.'  [Gal. 3:10]\n\n{58} Now Christian looked for nothing but death, and began to cry\nout lamentably; even cursing the time in which he met with Mr. Worldly\nWiseman; still calling himself a thousand fools for hearkening\nto his counsel; he also was greatly ashamed to think that this\ngentleman's arguments, flowing only from the flesh, should have\nthe prevalency with him as to cause him to forsake the right way.\nThis done, he applied himself again to Evangelist in words and\nsense as follow:\n\n{59} CHR. Sir, what think you?  Is there hope?  May I now go back\nand go up to the wicket-gate?  Shall I not be abandoned for this,\nand sent back from thence ashamed?  I am sorry I have hearkened to\nthis man's counsel.  But may my sin be forgiven?\n\nEVAN. Then said Evangelist to him, Thy sin is very great, for by\nit thou hast committed two evils:  thou hast forsaken the way that\nis good, to tread in forbidden paths; yet will the man at the gate\nreceive thee, for he has goodwill for men; only, said he, take heed\nthat thou turn not aside again, 'lest thou perish from the way,\nwhen his wrath is kindled but a little.'  [Ps. 2:12] Then did\nChristian address himself to go back; and Evangelist, after he had\nkissed him, gave him one smile, and bid him God-speed.  So he went\non with haste, neither spake he to any man by the way; nor, if any\nasked him, would he vouchsafe them an answer.  He went like one\nthat was all the while treading on forbidden ground, and could by\nno means think himself safe, till again he was got into the way\nwhich he left, to follow Mr. Worldly Wiseman's counsel.  So, in\nprocess of time, Christian got up to the gate.  Now, over the gate\nthere was written, 'Knock, and it shall be opened unto you.'  [Matt\n7:8]\n\n\n{60} \"He that will enter in must first without\n     Stand knocking at the Gate, nor need he doubt\n     That is A KNOCKER but to enter in;\n     For God can love him, and forgive his sin.\"\n\n\nHe knocked, therefore, more than once or twice, saying--\n\n  \"May I now enter here?  Will he within\n  Open to sorry me, though I have been\n  An undeserving rebel?  Then shall I\n  Not fail to sing his lasting praise on high.\"\n\n\nAt last there came a grave person to the gate, named Good-will, who\nasked who was there?  and whence he came?  and what he would have?\n\n{61} CHR. Here is a poor burdened sinner.  I come from the City of\nDestruction, but am going to Mount Zion, that I may be delivered\nfrom the wrath to come.  I would therefore, Sir, since I am informed\nthat by this gate is the way thither, know if you are willing to\nlet me in?\n\nGOOD-WILL. I am willing with all my heart, said he; and with that\nhe opened the gate.\n\n{62} So when Christian was stepping in, the other gave him a\npull.  Then said Christian, What means that?  The other told him.\nA little distance from this gate, there is erected a strong castle,\nof which Beelzebub is the captain; from thence, both he and them\nthat are with him shoot arrows at those that come up to this gate,\nif haply they may die before they can enter in.\n\nThen said Christian, I rejoice and tremble.  So when he was got\nin, the man of the gate asked him who directed him thither?\n\n{63} CHR. Evangelist bid me come hither, and knock, (as I did);\nand he said that you, Sir, would tell me what I must do.\n\nGOOD-WILL. An open door is set before thee, and no man can shut\nit.\n\nCHR. Now I begin to reap the benefits of my hazards.\n\nGOOD-WILL. But how is it that you came alone?\n\nCHR. Because none of my neighbours saw their danger, as I saw mine.\n\nGOOD-WILL. Did any of them know of your coming?\n\nCHR. Yes; my wife and children saw me at the first, and called\nafter me to turn again; also, some of my neighbours stood crying\nand calling after me to return; but I put my fingers in my ears,\nand so came on my way.\n\nGOOD-WILL. But did none of them follow you, to persuade you to go\nback?\n\nCHR. Yes, both Obstinate and Pliable; but when they saw that they\ncould not prevail, Obstinate went railing back, but Pliable came\nwith me a little way.\n\nGOOD-WILL. But why did he not come through?\n\n{64} CHR. We, indeed, came both together, until we came at the Slough\nof Despond, into the which we also suddenly fell.  And then was\nmy neighbour, Pliable, discouraged, and would not venture further.\nWherefore, getting out again on that side next to his own house,\nhe told me I should possess the brave country alone for him; so he\nwent his way, and I came mine--he after Obstinate, and I to this\ngate.\n\nGOOD-WILL. Then said Good-will, Alas, poor man!  is the celestial\nglory of so small esteem with him, that he counteth it not worth\nrunning the hazards of a few difficulties to obtain it?\n\n{65} CHR. Truly, said Christian, I have said the truth of Pliable,\nand if I should also say all the truth of myself, it will appear\nthere is no betterment betwixt him and myself.  It is true, he went\nback to his own house, but I also turned aside to go in the way of\ndeath, being persuaded thereto by the carnal arguments of one Mr.\nWorldly Wiseman.\n\nGOOD-WILL. Oh, did he light upon you?  What!  he would have had you\na sought for ease at the hands of Mr. Legality.  They are, both of\nthem, a very cheat.  But did you take his counsel?\n\nCHR. Yes, as far as I durst; I went to find out Mr. Legality, until\nI thought that the mountain that stands by his house would have\nfallen upon my head; wherefore there I was forced to stop.\n\nGOOD-WILL. That mountain has been the death of many, and will be\nthe death of many more; it is well you escaped being by it dashed\nin pieces.\n\nCHR. Why, truly, I do not know what had become of me there, had\nnot Evangelist happily met me again, as I was musing in the midst\nof my dumps; but it was God's mercy that he came to me again, for\nelse I had never come hither.  But now I am come, such a one as\nI am, more fit, indeed, for death, by that mountain, than thus to\nstand talking with my lord; but, oh, what a favour is this to me,\nthat yet I am admitted entrance here!\n\n{66} GOOD-WILL. We make no objections against any, notwithstanding\nall that they have done before they came hither.  They are in no\nwise cast out [John vi.37]; and therefore, good Christian, come a\nlittle way with me, and I will teach thee about the way thou must\ngo.  Look before thee; dost thou see this narrow way?  THAT is\nthe way thou must go; it was cast up by the patriarchs, prophets,\nChrist, and his apostles; and it is as straight as a rule can make\nit.  This is the way thou must go.\n\n{67} CHR. But, said Christian, are there no turnings or windings\nby which a stranger may lose his way?\n\nGOOD-WILL. Yes, there are many ways butt down upon this, and they\nare crooked and wide.  But thus thou mayest distinguish the right\nfrom the wrong, the right only being straight and narrow.  [Matt\n7:14]\n\n{68} Then I saw in my dream that Christian asked him further if\nhe could not help him off with his burden that was upon his back;\nfor as yet he had not got rid thereof, nor could he by any means\nget it off without help.\n\nHe told him, As to thy burden, be content to bear it, until thou\ncomest to the place of deliverance; for there it will fall from\nthy back of itself.\n\n{69} Then Christian began to gird up his loins, and to address\nhimself to his journey.  So the other told him, That by that he\nwas gone some distance from the gate, he would come at the house of\nthe Interpreter, at whose door he should knock, and he would show\nhim excellent things.  Then Christian took his leave of his friend,\nand he again bid him God-speed.\n\n{70} Then he went on till he came to the house of the Interpreter,\nwhere he knocked over and over; at last one came to the door, and\nasked who was there.\n\n{71} CHR. Sir, here is a traveller, who was bid by an acquaintance\nof the good-man of this house to call here for my profit; I would\ntherefore speak with the master of the house.  So he called for the\nmaster of the house, who, after a little time, came to Christian,\nand asked him what he would have.\n\nCHR. Sir, said Christian, I am a man that am come from the City\nof Destruction, and am going to the Mount Zion; and I was told by\nthe man that stands at the gate, at the head of this way, that if\nI called here, you would show me excellent things, such as would\nbe a help to me in my journey.\n\n{72} INTER. Then said the Interpreter, Come in; I will show that\nwhich will be profitable to thee.  So he commanded his man to light\nthe candle, and bid Christian follow him:  so he had him into\na private room, and bid his man open a door; the which when he\nhad done, Christian saw the picture of a very grave person hang\nup against the wall; and this was the fashion of it.  It had eyes\nlifted up to heaven, the best of books in his hand, the law of\ntruth was written upon his lips, the world was behind his back.\nIt stood as if it pleaded with men, and a crown of gold did hang\nover his head.\n\nCHR. Then said Christian, What meaneth this?\n\n{73} INTER. The man whose picture this is, is one of a thousand; he\ncan beget children [1 Cor. 4:15], travail in birth with children\n[Gal. 4:19], and nurse them himself when they are born.  And whereas\nthou seest him with his eyes lift up to heaven, the best of books\nin his hand, and the law of truth writ on his lips, it is to show\nthee that his work is to know and unfold dark things to sinners;\neven as also thou seest him stand as if he pleaded with men:  and\nwhereas thou seest the world as cast behind him, and that a crown\nhangs over his head, that is to show thee that slighting and\ndespising the things that are present, for the love that he hath\nto his Master's service, he is sure in the world that comes next\nto have glory for his reward.  Now, said the Interpreter, I have\nshowed thee this picture first, because the man whose picture this\nis, is the only man whom the Lord of the place whither thou art\ngoing, hath authorised to be thy guide in all difficult places thou\nmayest meet with in the way; wherefore, take good heed to what I\nhave shewed thee, and bear well in thy mind what thou hast seen,\nlest in thy journey thou meet with some that pretend to lead thee\nright, but their way goes down to death.\n\n{74} Then he took him by the hand, and led him into a very large\nparlour that was full of dust, because never swept; the which after\nhe had reviewed a little while, the Interpreter called for a man to\nsweep.  Now, when he began to sweep, the dust began so abundantly\nto fly about, that Christian had almost therewith been choked.\nThen said the Interpreter to a damsel that stood by, Bring hither\nthe water, and sprinkle the room; the which, when she had done, it\nwas swept and cleansed with pleasure.\n\n{75} CHR. Then said Christian, What means this?\n\nINTER. The Interpreter answered, This parlour is the heart of\na man that was never sanctified by the sweet grace of the gospel;\nthe dust is his original sin and inward corruptions, that have defiled\nthe whole man.  He that began to sweep at first, is the Law; but\nshe that brought water, and did sprinkle it, is the Gospel.  Now,\nwhereas thou sawest, that so soon as the first began to sweep, the\ndust did so fly about that the room by him could not be cleansed,\nbut that thou wast almost choked therewith; this is to shew thee,\nthat the law, instead of cleansing the heart (by its working) from\nsin, doth revive, put strength into, and increase it in the soul,\neven as it doth discover and forbid it, for it doth not give power\nto subdue.  [Rom. 7:6; 1 Cor. 15:56; Rom. 5:20]\n\n{76} Again, as thou sawest the damsel sprinkle the room with water,\nupon which it was cleansed with pleasure; this is to show thee,\nthat when the gospel comes in the sweet and precious influences\nthereof to the heart, then, I say, even as thou sawest the damsel\nlay the dust by sprinkling the floor with water, so is sin vanquished\nand subdued, and the soul made clean through the faith of it, and\nconsequently fit for the King of glory to inhabit.  [John 15:3;\nEph.  5:26; Acts 15:9; Rom. 16:25,26; John 15:13]\n\n{77} I saw, moreover, in my dream, that the Interpreter took him\nby the hand, and had him into a little room, where sat two little\nchildren, each one in his chair.  The name of the eldest was\nPassion, and the name of the other Patience.  Passion seemed to\nbe much discontented; but Patience was very quiet.  Then Christian\nasked, What is the reason of the discontent of Passion?  The\nInterpreter answered, The Governor of them would have him stay for\nhis best things till the beginning of the next year; but he will\nhave all now:  but Patience is willing to wait.\n\nThen I saw that one came to Passion, and brought him a bag of treasure,\nand poured it down at his feet, the which he took up and rejoiced\ntherein, and withal laughed Patience to scorn.  But I beheld but a\nwhile, and he had lavished all away, and had nothing left him but\nrags.\n\n{78} CHR. Then said Christian to the Interpreter, Expound this\nmatter more fully to me.\n\nINTER. So he said, These two lads are figures:  Passion, of the men\nof this world; and Patience, of the men of that which is to come;\nfor as here thou seest, Passion will have all now this year, that\nis to say, in this world; so are the men of this world, they must\nhave all their good things now, they cannot stay till next year,\nthat is until the next world, for their portion of good.  That\nproverb, 'A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush', is of more\nauthority with them than are all the Divine testimonies of the\ngood of the world to come.  But as thou sawest that he had quickly\nlavished all away, and had presently left him nothing but rags; so\nwill it be with all such men at the end of this world.\n\nCHR. Then said Christian, Now I see that Patience has the best\nwisdom, and that upon many accounts.  First, because he stays for\nthe best things.  Second, and also because he will have the glory\nof his, when the other has nothing but rags.\n\n{79} INTER. Nay, you may add another, to wit, the glory of the next\nworld will never wear out; but these are suddenly gone.  Therefore\nPassion had not so much reason to laugh at Patience, because he had\nhis good things first, as Patience will have to laugh at Passion,\nbecause he had his best things last; for first must give place to\nlast, because last must have his time to come; but last gives place\nto nothing; for there is not another to succeed.  He, therefore,\nthat hath his portion first, must needs have a time to spend it;\nbut he that hath his portion last, must have it lastingly; therefore\nit is said of Dives, \"Thou in thy life-time receivedst thy good\nthings, and likewise Lazarus evil things; but now he is comforted,\nand thou art tormented.\"  [Luke 16:25]\n\nCHR. Then I perceive it is not best to covet things that are now,\nbut to wait for things to come.\n\nINTER. You say the truth:  \"For the things which are seen are\ntemporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.\"  [2 Cor.\n4:18] But though this be so, yet since things present and our\nfleshly appetite are such near neighbours one to another; and again,\nbecause things to come, and carnal sense, are such strangers one\nto another; therefore it is, that the first of these so suddenly\nfall into amity, and that distance is so continued between the\nsecond.\n\n{80} Then I saw in my dream that the Interpreter took Christian by\nthe hand, and led him into a place where was a fire burning against\na wall, and one standing by it, always casting much water upon it,\nto quench it; yet did the fire burn higher and hotter.\n\nThen said Christian, What means this?\n\n{81} The Interpreter answered, This fire is the work of grace that\nis wrought in the heart; he that casts water upon it, to extinguish\nand put it out, is the Devil; but in that thou seest the fire\nnotwithstanding burn higher and hotter, thou shalt also see the\nreason of that.  So he had him about to the backside of the wall,\nwhere he saw a man with a vessel of oil in his hand, of the which\nhe did also continually cast, but secretly, into the fire.\n\nThen said Christian, What means this?\n\n{82} The Interpreter answered, This is Christ, who continually,\nwith the oil of his grace, maintains the work already begun in the\nheart:  by the means of which, notwithstanding what the devil can\ndo, the souls of his people prove gracious still.  [2 Cor. 12:9]\nAnd in that thou sawest that the man stood behind the wall to\nmaintain the fire, that is to teach thee that it is hard for the\ntempted to see how this work of grace is maintained in the soul.\n\nI saw also, that the Interpreter took him again by the hand, and\nled him into a pleasant place, where was builded a stately palace,\nbeautiful to behold; at the sight of which Christian was greatly\ndelighted.  He saw also, upon the top thereof, certain persons\nwalking, who were clothed all in gold.\n\nThen said Christian, May we go in thither?\n\n{83} Then the Interpreter took him, and led him up towards the\ndoor of the palace; and behold, at the door stood a great company\nof men, as desirous to go in; but durst not.  There also sat a man\nat a little distance from the door, at a table-side, with a book\nand his inkhorn before him, to take the name of him that should\nenter therein; he saw also, that in the doorway stood many men in\narmour to keep it, being resolved to do the men that would enter\nwhat hurt and mischief they could.  Now was Christian somewhat in\namaze.  At last, when every man started back for fear of the armed\nmen, Christian saw a man of a very stout countenance come up to the\nman that sat there to write, saying, Set down my name, Sir:  the\nwhich when he had done, he saw the man draw his sword, and put\na helmet upon his head, and rush toward the door upon the armed\nmen, who laid upon him with deadly force; but the man, not at all\ndiscouraged, fell to cutting and hacking most fiercely.  So after\nhe had received and given many wounds to those that attempted to\nkeep him out, he cut his way through them all [Acts 14:22], and\npressed forward into the palace, at which there was a pleasant voice\nheard from those that were within, even of those that walked upon\nthe top of the palace, saying--\n\n\"Come in, come in; Eternal glory thou shalt win.\"\n\nSo he went in, and was clothed with such garments as they.  Then\nChristian smiled and said; I think verily I know the meaning of\nthis.\n\n{84} Now, said Christian, let me go hence.  Nay, stay, said the\nInterpreter, till I have shewed thee a little more, and after that\nthou shalt go on thy way.  So he took him by the hand again, and\nled him into a very dark room, where there sat a man in an iron\ncage.\n\nNow the man, to look on, seemed very sad; he sat with his eyes looking\ndown to the ground, his hands folded together, and he sighed as if\nhe would break his heart.  Then said Christian, What means this?\nAt which the Interpreter bid him talk with the man.\n\nThen said Christian to the man, What art thou?  The man answered,\nI am what I was not once.\n\n{85} CHR. What wast thou once?\n\nMAN. The man said, I was once a fair and flourishing professor,\nboth in mine own eyes, and also in the eyes of others; I once was,\nas I thought, fair for the Celestial City, and had then even joy\nat the thoughts that I should get thither.  [Luke 8:13]\n\nCHR. Well, but what art thou now?\n\nMAN. I am now a man of despair, and am shut up in it, as in this\niron cage.  I cannot get out.  Oh, now I cannot!\n\nCHR. But how camest thou in this condition?\n\nMAN. I left off to watch and be sober.  I laid the reins, upon the\nneck of my lusts; I sinned against the light of the Word and the\ngoodness of God; I have grieved the Spirit, and he is gone; I tempted\nthe devil, and he is come to me; I have provoked God to anger, and\nhe has left me:  I have so hardened my heart, that I cannot repent.\n\n{86} Then said Christian to the Interpreter, But is there no hope\nfor such a man as this?  Ask him, said the Interpreter.  Nay, said\nChristian, pray, Sir, do you.\n\nINTER. Then said the Interpreter, Is there no hope, but you must\nbe kept in the iron cage of despair?\n\nMAN. No, none at all.\n\nINTER. Why, the Son of the Blessed is very pitiful.\n\nMAN. I have crucified him to myself afresh [Heb. 6:6]; I have\ndespised his person [Luke 19:14]; I have despised his righteousness;\nI have \"counted his blood an unholy thing\"; I have \"done despite\nto the Spirit of grace\".  [Heb. 10:28-29] Therefore I have shut\nmyself out of all the promises, and there now remains to me nothing\nbut threatenings, dreadful threatenings, fearful threatenings, of\ncertain judgement and fiery indignation, which shall devour me as\nan adversary.\n\n{87} INTER. For what did you bring yourself into this condition?\n\nMAN. For the lusts, pleasures, and profits of this world; in the\nenjoyment of which I did then promise myself much delight; but now\nevery one of those things also bite me, and gnaw me like a burning\nworm.\n\nINTER. But canst thou not now repent and turn?\n\n{88} MAN. God hath denied me repentance.  His Word gives me no\nencouragement to believe; yea, himself hath shut me up in this iron\ncage; nor can all the men in the world let me out.  O eternity,\neternity!  how shall I grapple with the misery that I must meet\nwith in eternity!\n\nINTER. Then said the Interpreter to Christian, Let this man's misery\nbe remembered by thee, and be an everlasting caution to thee.\n\nCHR. Well, said Christian, this is fearful!  God help me to watch\nand be sober, and to pray that I may shun the cause of this man's\nmisery!  Sir, is it not time for me to go on my way now?\n\nINTER. Tarry till I shall show thee one thing more, and then thou\nshalt go on thy way.\n\n{89} So he took Christian by the hand again, and led him into\na chamber, where there was one rising out of bed; and as he put\non his raiment, he shook and trembled.  Then said Christian, Why\ndoth this man thus tremble?  The Interpreter then bid him tell to\nChristian the reason of his so doing.  So he began and said, This\nnight, as I was in my sleep, I dreamed, and behold the heavens grew\nexceeding black; also it thundered and lightened in most fearful\nwise, that it put me into an agony; so I looked up in my dream, and\nsaw the clouds rack at an unusual rate, upon which I heard a great\nsound of a trumpet, and saw also a man sit upon a cloud, attended\nwith the thousands of heaven; they were all in flaming fire:  also\nthe heavens were in a burning flame.  I heard then a voice saying,\n\"Arise, ye dead, and come to judgement\"; and with that the rocks\nrent, the graves opened, and the dead that were therein came forth.\nSome of them were exceeding glad, and looked upward; and some\nsought to hide themselves under the mountains.  [1 Cor. 15:52; 1\nThes. 4:16; Jude 14; John 5:28,29; 2 Thes. 1:7,8; Rev. 20:11-14;\nIsa. 26:21; Micah 7:16,17; Ps. 95:1-3; Dan. 7:10] Then I saw the\nman that sat upon the cloud open the book, and bid the world draw\nnear.  Yet there was, by reason of a fierce flame which issued out\nand came from before him, a convenient distance betwixt him and\nthem, as betwixt the judge and the prisoners at the bar.  [Mal.\n3:2,3; Dan. 7:9,10] I heard it also proclaimed to them that attended\non the man that sat on the cloud, Gather together the tares, the\nchaff, and stubble, and cast them into the burning lake.  [Matt.\n3:12; 13:30; Mal.  4:1] And with that, the bottomless pit opened,\njust whereabout I stood; out of the mouth of which there came, in\nan abundant manner, smoke and coals of fire, with hideous noises.\nIt was also said to the same persons, \"Gather my wheat into\nthe garner.\"  [Luke 3:17] And with that I saw many catched up and\ncarried away into the clouds, but I was left behind.  [1 Thes.\n4:16,17] I also sought to hide myself, but I could not, for the man\nthat sat upon the cloud still kept his eye upon me; my sins also\ncame into my mind; and my conscience did accuse me on every side.\n[Rom. 3:14,15] Upon this I awaked from my sleep.\n\n{90} CHR. But what is it that made you so afraid of this sight?\n\nMAN. Why, I thought that the day of judgement was come, and that I\nwas not ready for it:  but this frighted me most, that the angels\ngathered up several, and left me behind; also the pit of hell opened\nher mouth just where I stood.  My conscience, too, afflicted me;\nand, as I thought, the Judge had always his eye upon me, shewing\nindignation in his countenance.\n\n{91} Then said the Interpreter to Christian, Hast thou considered\nall these things?\n\nCHR. Yes, and they put me in hope and fear.\n\nINTER. Well, keep all things so in thy mind that they may be as a\ngoad in thy sides, to prick thee forward in the way thou must go.\nThen Christian began to gird up his loins, and to address himself\nto his journey.  Then said the Interpreter, The Comforter be always\nwith thee, good Christian, to guide thee in the way that leads to\nthe City.  So Christian went on his way, saying--\n\n\"Here I have seen things rare and profitable; Things pleasant,\ndreadful, things to make me stable In what I have begun to take\nin hand; Then let me think on them, and understand Wherefore they\nshowed me were, and let me be Thankful, O good Interpreter, to\nthee.\"\n\n{92} Now I saw in my dream, that the highway up which Christian\nwas to go, was fenced on either side with a wall, and that wall\nwas called Salvation.  [Isa. 26:1] Up this way, therefore, did\nburdened Christian run, but not without great difficulty, because\nof the load on his back.\n\n{93} He ran thus till he came at a place somewhat ascending, and\nupon that place stood a cross, and a little below, in the bottom,\na sepulchre.  So I saw in my dream, that just as Christian came up\nwith the cross, his burden loosed from off his shoulders, and fell\nfrom off his back, and began to tumble, and so continued to do,\ntill it came to the mouth of the sepulchre, where it fell in, and\nI saw it no more.\n\n{94} Then was Christian glad and lightsome, and said, with a\nmerry heart, \"He hath given me rest by his sorrow, and life by his\ndeath.\"  Then he stood still awhile to look and wonder; for it was\nvery surprising to him, that the sight of the cross should thus\nease him of his burden.  He looked therefore, and looked again,\neven till the springs that were in his head sent the waters down\nhis cheeks.  [Zech. 12:10] Now, as he stood looking and weeping,\nbehold three Shining Ones came to him and saluted him with \"Peace\nbe unto thee\".  So the first said to him, \"Thy sins be forgiven\nthee\" [Mark 2:5]; the second stripped him of his rags, and clothed\nhim with change of raiment [Zech. 3:4]; the third also set a mark\non his forehead, and gave him a roll with a seal upon it, which he\nbade him look on as he ran, and that he should give it in at the\nCelestial Gate.  [Eph. 1:13] So they went their way.\n\n\"Who's this?  the Pilgrim.  How!  'tis very true, Old things are\npast away, all's become new.  Strange!  he's another man, upon my\nword, They be fine feathers that make a fine bird.\n\nThen Christian gave three leaps for joy, and went on singing--\n\n  \"Thus far I did come laden with my sin;\n  Nor could aught ease the grief that I was in\n  Till I came hither:  What a place is this!\n  Must here be the beginning of my bliss?\n  Must here the burden fall from off my back?\n  Must here the strings that bound it to me crack?\n  Blest cross! blest sepulchre! blest rather be\n  The Man that there was put to shame for me!\"\n\n\n{95} I saw then in my dream, that he went on thus, even until he\ncame at a bottom, where he saw, a little out of the way, three men\nfast asleep, with fetters upon their heels.  The name of the one\nwas Simple, another Sloth, and the third Presumption.\n\n{96} Christian then seeing them lie in this case went to them, if\nperadventure he might awake them, and cried, You are like them that\nsleep on the top of a mast, for the Dead Sea is under you--a gulf\nthat hath no bottom.  [Prov. 23:34] Awake, therefore, and come\naway; be willing also, and I will help you off with your irons.  He\nalso told them, If he that \"goeth about like a roaring lion\" comes\nby, you will certainly become a prey to his teeth.  [1 Pet. 5:8]\nWith that they looked upon him, and began to reply in this sort:\nSimple said, \"I see no danger\"; Sloth said, \"Yet a little more\nsleep\"; and Presumption said, \"Every fat must stand upon its own\nbottom; what is the answer else that I should give thee?\"  And so\nthey lay down to sleep again, and Christian went on his way.\n\n{97} Yet was he troubled to think that men in that danger should\nso little esteem the kindness of him that so freely offered to help\nthem, both by awakening of them, counselling of them, and proffering\nto help them off with their irons.  And as he was troubled thereabout,\nhe espied two men come tumbling over the wall on the left hand of\nthe narrow way; and they made up apace to him.  The name of the one\nwas Formalist, and the name of the other Hypocrisy.  So, as I said,\nthey drew up unto him, who thus entered with them into discourse.\n\n{98} CHR. Gentlemen, whence came you, and whither go you?\n\nFORM. and HYP. We were born in the land of Vain-glory, and are\ngoing for praise to Mount Zion.\n\nCHR. Why came you not in at the gate which standeth at the beginning\nof the way?  Know you not that it is written, that he that cometh\nnot in by the door, \"but climbeth up some other way, the same is\na thief and a robber?\"  [John 10:1]\n\nFORM. and HYP. They said, That to go to the gate for entrance was,\nby all their countrymen, counted too far about; and that, therefore,\ntheir usual way was to make a short cut of it, and to climb over\nthe wall, as they had done.\n\nCHR. But will it not be counted a trespass against the Lord of the\ncity whither we are bound, thus to violate his revealed will?\n\n{99} FORM. and HYP. They told him, that, as for that, he needed not\nto trouble his head thereabout; for what they did they had custom\nfor; and could produce, if need were, testimony that would witness\nit for more than a thousand years.\n\nCHR. But, said Christian, will your practice stand a trial at law?\n\nFORM. and HYP. They told him, That custom, it being of so long a\nstanding as above a thousand years, would, doubtless, now be admitted\nas a thing legal by any impartial judge; and besides, said they,\nif we get into the way, what's matter which way we get in?  if we\nare in, we are in; thou art but in the way, who, as we perceive,\ncame in at the gate; and we are also in the way, that came tumbling\nover the wall; wherein, now, is thy condition better than ours?\n\nCHR. I walk by the rule of my Master; you walk by the rude working\nof your fancies.  You are counted thieves already, by the Lord of\nthe way; therefore, I doubt you will not be found true men at the\nend of the way.  You come in by yourselves, without his direction;\nand shall go out by yourselves, without his mercy.\n\n{100} To this they made him but little answer; only they bid him\nlook to himself.  Then I saw that they went on every man in his\nway without much conference one with another, save that these two\nmen told Christian, that as to laws and ordinances, they doubted\nnot but they should as conscientiously do them as he; therefore,\nsaid they, we see not wherein thou differest from us but by the coat\nthat is on thy back, which was, as we trow, given thee by some of\nthy neighbours, to hide the shame of thy nakedness.\n\n{101} CHR. By laws and ordinances you will not be saved, since you\ncame not in by the door.  [Gal. 2:16] And as for this coat that\nis on my back, it was given me by the Lord of the place whither I\ngo; and that, as you say, to cover my nakedness with.  And I take\nit as a token of his kindness to me; for I had nothing but rags\nbefore.  And besides, thus I comfort myself as I go:  Surely, think\nI, when I come to the gate of the city, the Lord thereof will know\nme for good since I have this coat on my back--a coat that he\ngave me freely in the day that he stripped me of my rags.  I have,\nmoreover, a mark in my forehead, of which, perhaps, you have taken\nno notice, which one of my Lord's most intimate associates fixed\nthere in the day that my burden fell off my shoulders.  I will tell\nyou, moreover, that I had then given me a roll, sealed, to comfort\nme by reading as I go on the way; I was also bid to give it in at\nthe Celestial Gate, in token of my certain going in after it; all\nwhich things, I doubt, you want, and want them because you came\nnot in at the gate.\n\n{102} To these things they gave him no answer; only they looked\nupon each other, and laughed.  Then, I saw that they went on all,\nsave that Christian kept before, who had no more talk but with\nhimself, and that sometimes sighingly, and sometimes comfortably;\nalso he would be often reading in the roll that one of the Shining\nOnes gave him, by which he was refreshed.\n\n{103} I beheld, then, that they all went on till they came to the\nfoot of the Hill Difficulty; at the bottom of which was a spring.\nThere were also in the same place two other ways besides that which\ncame straight from the gate; one turned to the left hand, and the\nother to the right, at the bottom of the hill; but the narrow way\nlay right up the hill, and the name of the going up the side of\nthe hill is called Difficulty.  Christian now went to the spring,\nand drank thereof, to refresh himself [Isa. 49:10], and then began\nto go up the hill, saying--\n\n\n  \"The hill, though high, I covet to ascend,\n  The difficulty will not me offend;\n  For I perceive the way to life lies here.\n  Come, pluck up heart, let's neither faint nor fear;\n  Better, though difficult, the right way to go,\n  Than wrong, though easy, where the end is woe.\"\n\n\n{104} The other two also came to the foot of the hill; but when\nthey saw that the hill was steep and high, and that there were two\nother ways to go, and supposing also that these two ways might meet\nagain, with that up which Christian went, on the other side of the\nhill, therefore they were resolved to go in those ways.  Now the\nname of one of these ways was Danger, and the name of the other\nDestruction.  So the one took the way which is called Danger,\nwhich led him into a great wood, and the other took directly up the\nway to Destruction, which led him into a wide field, full of dark\nmountains, where he stumbled and fell, and rose no more.\n\n\"Shall they who wrong begin yet rightly end?  Shall they at all\nhave safety for their friend?  No, no; in headstrong manner they\nset out, And headlong will they fall at last no doubt.\"\n\n{105} I looked, then, after Christian, to see him go up the hill,\nwhere I perceived he fell from running to going, and from going to\nclambering upon his hands and his knees, because of the steepness\nof the place.  Now, about the midway to the top of the hill was a\npleasant arbour, made by the Lord of the hill for the refreshing\nof weary travellers; thither, therefore, Christian got, where also\nhe sat down to rest him.  Then he pulled his roll out of his bosom,\nand read therein to his comfort; he also now began afresh to take\na review of the coat or garment that was given him as he stood by\nthe cross.  Thus pleasing himself awhile, he at last fell into a\nslumber, and thence into a fast sleep, which detained him in that\nplace until it was almost night; and in his sleep, his roll fell\nout of his hand.  Now, as he was sleeping, there came one to him,\nand awaked him, saying, Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her\nways and be wise.  [Prov. 6:6] And with that Christian started\nup, and sped him on his way, and went apace, till he came to the\ntop of the hill.\n\n{106} Now, when he was got up to the top of the hill, there came\ntwo men running to meet him amain; the name of the one was Timorous,\nand of the other, Mistrust; to whom Christian said, Sirs, what's\nthe matter?  You run the wrong way.  Timorous answered, that they\nwere going to the City of Zion, and had got up that difficult\nplace; but, said he, the further we go, the more danger we meet\nwith; wherefore we turned, and are going back again.\n\nYes, said Mistrust, for just before us lie a couple of lions in\nthe way, whether sleeping or waking we know not, and we could not\nthink, if we came within reach, but they would presently pull us\nin pieces.\n\n{107} CHR. Then said Christian, You make me afraid, but whither\nshall I fly to be safe?  If I go back to mine own country, that\nis prepared for fire and brimstone, and I shall certainly perish\nthere.  If I can get to the Celestial City, I am sure to be in\nsafety there.  I must venture.  To go back is nothing but death;\nto go forward is fear of death, and life-everlasting beyond it.  I\nwill yet go forward.  So Mistrust and Timorous ran down the hill,\nand Christian went on his way.  But, thinking again of what he had\nheard from the men, he felt in his bosom for his roll, that he\nmight read therein, and be comforted; but he felt, and found it\nnot.  Then was Christian in great distress, and knew not what to\ndo; for he wanted that which used to relieve him, and that which\nshould have been his pass into the Celestial City.  Here, therefore,\nhe begun to be much perplexed, and knew not what to do.  At last\nhe bethought himself that he had slept in the arbour that is on\nthe side of the hill; and, falling down upon his knees, he asked\nGod's forgiveness for that his foolish act, and then went back to\nlook for his roll.  But all the way he went back, who can sufficiently\nset forth the sorrow of Christian's heart?  Sometimes he sighed,\nsometimes he wept, and oftentimes he chid himself for being so\nfoolish to fall asleep in that place, which was erected only for\na little refreshment for his weariness.  Thus, therefore, he went\nback, carefully looking on this side and on that, all the way as he\nwent, if happily he might find his roll, that had been his comfort\nso many times in his journey.  He went thus, till he came again\nwithin sight of the arbour where he sat and slept; but that sight\nrenewed his sorrow the more, by bringing again, even afresh, his\nevil of sleeping into his mind.  [Rev. 2:5; 1 Thes. 5:7,8] Thus,\ntherefore, he now went on bewailing his sinful sleep, saying, O\nwretched man that I am that I should sleep in the day-time!  that I\nshould sleep in the midst of difficulty!  that I should so indulge\nthe flesh, as to use that rest for ease to my flesh, which the\nLord of the hill hath erected only for the relief of the spirits\nof pilgrims!\n\n{108} How many steps have I took in vain!  Thus it happened\nto Israel, for their sin; they were sent back again by the way of\nthe Red Sea; and I am made to tread those steps with sorrow, which\nI might have trod with delight, had it not been for this sinful\nsleep.  How far might I have been on my way by this time!  I am\nmade to tread those steps thrice over, which I needed not to have\ntrod but once; yea, now also I am like to be benighted, for the\nday is almost spent.  O, that I had not slept!\n\n{109} Now, by this time he was come to the arbour again, where for\na while he sat down and wept; but at last, as Christian would have\nit, looking sorrowfully down under the settle, there he espied his\nroll; the which he, with trembling and haste, catched up, and put\nit into his bosom.  But who can tell how joyful this man was when\nhe had gotten his roll again!  for this roll was the assurance of\nhis life and acceptance at the desired haven.  Therefore he laid\nit up in his bosom, gave thanks to God for directing his eye to the\nplace where it lay, and with joy and tears betook himself again to\nhis journey.  But oh, how nimbly now did he go up the rest of the\nhill!  Yet, before he got up, the sun went down upon Christian;\nand this made him again recall the vanity of his sleeping to his\nremembrance; and thus he again began to condole with himself:  O\nthou sinful sleep; how, for thy sake, am I like to be benighted in\nmy journey!  I must walk without the sun; darkness must cover the\npath of my feet; and I must hear the noise of the doleful creatures,\nbecause of my sinful sleep.  [1 Thes. 5:6,7] Now also he remembered\nthe story that Mistrust and Timorous told him of; how they were\nfrighted with the sight of the lions.  Then said Christian to\nhimself again, These beasts range in the night for their prey; and\nif they should meet with me in the dark, how should I shift them?\nHow should I escape being by them torn in pieces?  Thus he went on\nhis way.  But while he was thus bewailing his unhappy miscarriage,\nhe lift up his eyes, and behold there was a very stately palace\nbefore him, the name of which was Beautiful; and it stood just by\nthe highway side.\n\n{110} So I saw in my dream that he made haste and went forward,\nthat if possible he might get lodging there.  Now, before he had\ngone far, he entered into a very narrow passage, which was about\na furlong off the porter's lodge; and looking very narrowly before\nhim as he went, he espied two lions in the way.  Now, thought he,\nI see the dangers that Mistrust and Timorous were driven back by.\n(The lions were chained, but he saw not the chains.) Then he was\nafraid, and thought also himself to go back after them, for he\nthought nothing but death was before him.  But the porter at the\nlodge, whose name is Watchful, perceiving that Christian made a halt\nas if he would go back, cried unto him, saying, Is thy strength so\nsmall?  [Mark 8:34-37] Fear not the lions, for they are chained, and\nare placed there for trial of faith where it is, and for discovery\nof those that had none.  Keep in the midst of the path, no hurt\nshall come unto thee.\n\n\n  \"Difficulty is behind, Fear is before,\n  Though he's got on the hill, the lions roar;\n  A Christian man is never long at ease,\n  When one fright's gone, another doth him seize.\"\n\n\n{111} Then I saw that he went on, trembling for fear of the lions,\nbut taking good heed to the directions of the porter; he heard\nthem roar, but they did him no harm.  Then he clapped his hands,\nand went on till he came and stood before the gate where the porter\nwas.  Then said Christian to the porter, Sir, what house is this?\nAnd may I lodge here to-night?  The porter answered, This house\nwas built by the Lord of the hill, and he built it for the relief\nand security of pilgrims.  The porter also asked whence he was,\nand whither he was going.\n\n{112} CHR. I am come from the City of Destruction, and am going to\nMount Zion; but because the sun is now set, I desire, if I may, to\nlodge here to-night.\n\nPOR. What is your name?\n\nCHR. My name is now Christian, but my name at the first was Graceless;\nI came of the race of Japheth, whom God will persuade to dwell in\nthe tents of Shem.  [Gen. 9:27]\n\nPOR. But how doth it happen that you come so late?  The sun is set.\n\n{113} CHR. I had been here sooner, but that, \"wretched man that\nI am!\"  I slept in the arbour that stands on the hillside; nay, I\nhad, notwithstanding that, been here much sooner, but that, in my\nsleep, I lost my evidence, and came without it to the brow of the\nhill and then feeling for it, and finding it not, I was forced with\nsorrow of heart, to go back to the place where I slept my sleep,\nwhere I found it, and now I am come.\n\nPOR. Well, I will call out one of the virgins of this place, who\nwill, if she likes your talk, bring you into the rest of the family,\naccording to the rules of the house.  So Watchful, the porter, rang\na bell, at the sound of which came out at the door of the house,\na grave and beautiful damsel, named Discretion, and asked why she\nwas called.\n\n{114} The porter answered, This man is in a journey from the City\nof Destruction to Mount Zion, but being weary and benighted, he\nasked me if he might lodge here to-night; so I told him I would call\nfor thee, who, after discourse had with him, mayest do as seemeth\nthee good, even according to the law of the house.\n\n{115} Then she asked him whence he was, and whither he was going,\nand he told her.  She asked him also how he got into the way; and\nhe told her.  Then she asked him what he had seen and met with\nin the way; and he told, her.  And last she asked his name; so he\nsaid, It is Christian, and I have so much the more a desire to lodge\nhere to-night, because, by what I perceive, this place was built\nby the Lord of the hill for the relief and security of pilgrims.\nSo she smiled, but the water stood in her eyes; and after a\nlittle pause, she said, I will call forth two or three more of the\nfamily.  So she ran to the door, and called out Prudence, Piety,\nand Charity, who, after a little more discourse with him, had him\ninto the family; and many of them, meeting him at the threshold\nof the house, said, Come in, thou blessed of the Lord; this house\nwas built by the Lord of the hill, on purpose to entertain such\npilgrims in.  Then he bowed his head, and followed them into the\nhouse.  So when he was come in and sat down, they gave him something\nto drink, and consented together, that until supper was ready, some\nof them should have some particular discourse with Christian, for\nthe best improvement of time; and they appointed Piety, and Prudence,\nand Charity to discourse with him; and thus they began:\n\n{116} PIETY. Come, good Christian, since we have been so loving\nto you, to receive you in our house this night, let us, if perhaps\nwe may better ourselves thereby, talk with you of all things that\nhave happened to you in your pilgrimage.\n\nCHR. With a very good will, and I am glad that you are so well\ndisposed.\n\n{117} PIETY. What moved you at first to betake yourself to a\npilgrim's life?\n\nCHR. I was driven out of my native country by a dreadful sound that\nwas in mine ears:  to wit, that unavoidable destruction did attend\nme, if I abode in that place where I was.\n\nPIETY. But how did it happen that you came out of your country this\nway?\n\nCHR. It was as God would have it; for when I was under the fears\nof destruction, I did not know whither to go; but by chance there\ncame a man, even to me, as I was trembling and weeping, whose name\nis Evangelist, and he directed me to the wicket-gate, which else I\nshould never have found, and so set me into the way that hath led\nme directly to this house.\n\n{118} PIETY. But did you not come by the house of the Interpreter?\n\nCHR. Yes, and did see such things there, the remembrance of which\nwill stick by me as long as I live; especially three things:  to\nwit, how Christ, in despite of Satan, maintains his work of grace\nin the heart; how the man had sinned himself quite out of hopes of\nGod's mercy; and also the dream of him that thought in his sleep\nthe day of judgement was come.\n\nPIETY. Why, did you hear him tell his dream?\n\nCHR. Yes, and a dreadful one it was.  I thought it made my heart\nache as he was telling of it; but yet I am glad I heard it.\n\n{119} PIETY. Was that all that you saw at the house of the Interpreter?\n\nCHR. No; he took me and had me where he shewed me a stately palace,\nand how the people were clad in gold that were in it; and how there\ncame a venturous man and cut his way through the armed men that\nstood in the door to keep him out, and how he was bid to come in,\nand win eternal glory.  Methought those things did ravish my heart!\nI would have stayed at that good man's house a twelvemonth, but\nthat I knew I had further to go.\n\n{120} PIETY. And what saw you else in the way?\n\nCHR. Saw!  why, I went but a little further, and I saw one, as\nI thought in my mind, hang bleeding upon the tree; and the very\nsight of him made my burden fall off my back, (for I groaned under\na very heavy burden,) but then it fell down from off me.  It was\na strange thing to me, for I never saw such a thing before; yea,\nand while I stood looking up, for then I could not forbear looking,\nthree Shining Ones came to me.  One of them testified that my sins\nwere forgiven me; another stripped me of my rags, and gave me this\nbroidered coat which you see; and the third set the mark which you\nsee in my forehead, and gave me this sealed roll.  (And with that\nhe plucked it out of his bosom.)\n\n{121} PIETY. But you saw more than this, did you not?\n\nCHR. The things that I have told you were the best; yet some other\nmatters I saw, as, namely--I saw three men, Simple, Sloth, and\nPresumption, lie asleep a little out of the way, as I came, with\nirons upon their heels; but do you think I could awake them?  I\nalso saw Formality and Hypocrisy come tumbling over the wall, to\ngo, as they pretended, to Zion, but they were quickly lost, even\nas I myself did tell them; but they would not believe.  But above\nall, I found it hard work to get up this hill, and as hard to come\nby the lions' mouths, and truly if it had not been for the good\nman, the porter that stands at the gate, I do not know but that\nafter all I might have gone back again; but now I thank God I am\nhere, and I thank you for receiving of me.\n\n{122} Then Prudence thought good to ask him a few questions, and\ndesired his answer to them.\n\nPRUD. Do you not think sometimes of the country from whence you\ncame?\n\nChristian's thoughts of his native country\n\nCHR. Yes, but with much shame and detestation:  \"Truly, if I had\nbeen mindful of that country from whence I came out, I might have\nhad opportunity to have returned; but now I desire a better country,\nthat is, an heavenly.\"  [Heb. 11:15,16]\n\nPRUD. Do you not yet bear away with you some of the things that\nthen you were conversant withal?\n\nCHR. Yes, but greatly against my will; especially my inward and\ncarnal cogitations, with which all my countrymen, as well as myself,\nwere delighted; but now all those things are my grief; and might\nI but choose mine own things,\n\nChristian's choice\n\nI would choose never to think of those things more; but when I\nwould be doing of that which is best, that which is worst is with\nme.  [Rom 7:16-19]\n\n{123} PRUD. Do you not find sometimes, as if those things were\nvanquished, which at other times are your perplexity?\n\nChristian's golden hours\n\nCHR. Yes, but that is seldom; but they are to me golden hours in\nwhich such things happen to me.\n\nPRUD. Can you remember by what means you find your annoyances, at\ntimes, as if they were vanquished?\n\nCHR. Yes, when I think what I saw at the cross, that will do it;\nand when I look upon my broidered coat, that will do it; also when\nI look into the roll that I carry in my bosom, that will do it;\nand when my thoughts wax warm about whither I am going, that will\ndo it.\n\n{124} PRUD. And what is it that makes you so desirous to go to\nMount Zion?\n\nCHR. Why, there I hope to see him alive that did hang dead on the\ncross; and there I hope to be rid of all those things that to this\nday are in me an annoyance to me; there, they say, there is no\ndeath; and there I shall dwell with such company as I like best.\n[Isa. 25:8; Rev. 21:4] For, to tell you truth, I love him,\nbecause I was by him eased of my burden; and I am weary of my inward\nsickness.  I would fain be where I shall die no more, and with the\ncompany that shall continually cry, \"Holy, Holy, Holy!\"\n\n{125} Then said Charity to Christian, Have you a family?  Are you\na married man?\n\nCHR. I have a wife and four small children.\n\nCHAR. And why did you not bring them along with you?\n\nChristian's love to his wife and children\n\nCHR. Then Christian wept, and said, Oh, how willingly would I have\ndone it!  but they were all of them utterly averse to my going on\npilgrimage.\n\nCHAR. But you should have talked to them, and have endeavoured to\nhave shown them the danger of being behind.\n\nCHR. So I did; and told them also of what God had shown to me\nof the destruction of our city; \"but I seemed to them as one that\nmocked\", and they believed me not.  [Gen. 19:14]\n\nCHAR. And did you pray to God that he would bless your counsel to\nthem?\n\nCHR. Yes, and that with much affection:  for you must think that\nmy wife and poor children were very dear unto me.\n\nCHAR. But did you tell them of your own sorrow, and fear of\ndestruction?  for I suppose that destruction was visible enough to\nyou.\n\nChristian's fears of perishing might be read in his very countenance\n\nCHR. Yes, over, and over, and over.  They might also see my fears\nin my countenance, in my tears, and also in my trembling under the\napprehension of the judgement that did hang over our heads; but\nall was not sufficient to prevail with them to come with me.\n\nCHAR. But what could they say for themselves, why they came not?\n\n{126} CHR. Why, my wife was afraid of losing this world, and\nmy children were given to the foolish delights of youth:  so what\nby one thing, and what by another, they left me to wander in this\nmanner alone.\n\nCHAR. But did you not, with your vain life, damp all that you by\nwords used by way of persuasion to bring them away with you?\n\n{127} Christian's good conversation before his wife and children\n\nCHR. Indeed, I cannot commend my life; for I am conscious to myself\nof many failings therein; I know also that a man by his conversation\nmay soon overthrow what by argument or persuasion he doth labour to\nfasten upon others for their good.  Yet this I can say, I was very\nwary of giving them occasion, by any unseemly action, to make them\naverse to going on pilgrimage.  Yea, for this very thing they would\ntell me I was too precise, and that I denied myself of things,\nfor their sakes, in which they saw no evil.  Nay, I think I may\nsay, that if what they saw in me did hinder them, it was my great\ntenderness in sinning against God, or of doing any wrong to my\nneighbour.\n\nCHAR. Indeed Cain hated his brother, \"because his own works were\nevil, and his brother's righteous\" [1 John 3:12]; and if thy wife\nand children have been offended with thee for this, they thereby\nshow themselves to be implacable to good, and \"thou hast delivered\nthy soul from their blood\".  [Ezek. 3:19]\n\n{128} Now I saw in my dream, that thus they sat talking together\nuntil supper was ready.  So when they had made ready, they sat down\nto meat.  Now the table was furnished \"with fat things, and with\nwine that was well refined\":  and all their talk at the table was\nabout the Lord of the hill; as, namely, about what he had done, and\nwherefore he did what he did, and why he had builded that house.\nAnd by what they said, I perceived that he had been a great warrior,\nand had fought with and slain \"him that had the Power of death\",\nbut not without great danger to himself, which made me love him\nthe more.  [Heb. 2:14,15]\n\n{129} For, as they said, and as I believe (said Christian), he did\nit with the loss of much blood; but that which put glory of grace\ninto all he did, was, that he did it out of pure love to his country.\nAnd besides, there were some of them of the household that said\nthey had been and spoke with him since he did die on the cross; and\nthey have attested that they had it from his own lips, that he is\nsuch a lover of poor pilgrims, that the like is not to be found\nfrom the east to the west.\n\n{130} They, moreover, gave an instance of what they affirmed, and\nthat was, he had stripped himself of his glory, that he might do\nthis for the poor; and that they heard him say and affirm, \"that\nhe would not dwell in the mountain of Zion alone.\"  They said,\nmoreover, that he had made many pilgrims princes, though by nature\nthey were beggars born, and their original had been the dunghill.\n[1 Sam 2:8; Ps. 113:7]\n\n{131} Christian's bedchamber\n\nThus they discoursed together till late at night; and after they had\ncommitted themselves to their Lord for protection, they betook\nthemselves to rest:  the Pilgrim they laid in a large upper\nchamber, whose window opened towards the sun-rising:  the name of\nthe chamber was Peace; where he slept till break of day, and then\nhe awoke and sang--\n\n  \"Where am I now?  Is this the love and care\n  Of Jesus for the men that pilgrims are?\n  Thus to provide! that I should be forgiven!\n  And dwell already the next door to heaven!\"\n\n\n{132} So in the morning they all got up; and, after some more\ndiscourse, they told him that he should not depart till they had\nshown him the rarities of that place.  And first they had him into\nthe study, where they showed him records of the greatest antiquity;\nin which, as I remember my dream, they showed him first the pedigree of\nthe Lord of the hill, that he was the son of the Ancient of Days,\nand came by that eternal generation.  Here also was more fully\nrecorded the acts that he had done, and the names of many hundreds\nthat he had taken into his service; and how he had placed them in\nsuch habitations that could neither by length of days, nor decays\nof nature, be dissolved.\n\n{133} Then they read to him some of the worthy acts that some of\nhis servants had done:  as, how they had \"subdued kingdoms, wrought\nrighteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,\nquenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out\nof weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, and turned\nto flight the armies of the aliens.\"  [Heb 11:33,34]\n\n{134} They then read again, in another part of the records of the\nhouse, where it was shewed how willing their Lord was to receive\ninto his favour any, even any, though they in time past had offered\ngreat affronts to his person and proceedings.  Here also were\nseveral other histories of many other famous things, of all which\nChristian had a view; as of things both ancient and modern; together\nwith prophecies and predictions of things that have their certain\naccomplishment, both to the dread and amazement of enemies, and\nthe comfort and solace of pilgrims.\n\n{135} The next day they took him and had him into the armoury,\nwhere they showed him all manner of furniture, which their Lord\nhad provided for pilgrims, as sword, shield, helmet, breastplate,\nALL-PRAYER, and shoes that would not wear out.  And there was here\nenough of this to harness out as many men for the service of their\nLord as there be stars in the heaven for multitude.\n\n{136} They also showed him some of the engines with which some of\nhis servants had done wonderful things.  They shewed him Moses'\nrod; the hammer and nail with which Jael slew Sisera; the pitchers,\ntrumpets, and lamps too, with which Gideon put to flight the armies\nof Midian.  Then they showed him the ox's goad wherewith Shamgar\nslew six hundred men.  They showed him also the jaw-bone with which\nSamson did such mighty feats.  They showed him, moreover, the sling\nand stone with which David slew Goliath of Gath; and the sword,\nalso, with which their Lord will kill the Man of Sin, in the day\nthat he shall rise up to the prey.  They showed him, besides, many\nexcellent things, with which Christian was much delighted.  This\ndone, they went to their rest again.\n\n{137} Then I saw in my dream, that on the morrow he got up to go\nforward; but they desired him to stay till the next day also; and\nthen, said they, we will, if the day be clear, show you the Delectable\nMountains, which, they said, would yet further add to his comfort,\nbecause they were nearer the desired haven than the place where at\npresent he was; so he consented and stayed.  When the morning was\nup, they had him to the top of the house, and bid him look south;\nso he did:  and behold, at a great distance, he saw a most pleasant\nmountainous country, beautified with woods, vineyards, fruits of\nall sorts, flowers also, with springs and fountains, very delectable\nto behold.  [Isa. 33:16,17] Then he asked the name of the country.\nThey said it was Immanuel's Land; and it is as common, said they,\nas this hill is, to and for all the pilgrims.  And when thou comest\nthere from thence, said they, thou mayest see to the gate of the\nCelestial City, as the shepherds that live there will make appear.\n\n{138} Now he bethought himself of setting forward, and they were\nwilling he should.  But first, said they, let us go again into the\narmoury.  So they did; and when they came there, they harnessed him\nfrom head to foot with what was of proof, lest, perhaps, he should\nmeet with assaults in the way.  He being, therefore, thus accoutred,\nwalketh out with his friends to the gate, and there he asked the\nporter if he saw any pilgrims pass by.  Then the porter answered,\nYes.\n\n{139} CHR. Pray, did you know him?  said he.\n\nPOR. I asked him his name, and he told me it was Faithful.\n\nCHR. Oh, said Christian, I know him; he is my townsman, my near\nneighbour; he comes from the place where I was born.  How far do\nyou think he may be before?\n\nPOR. He is got by this time below the hill.\n\nCHR. Well, said Christian, good Porter, the Lord be with thee, and\nadd to all thy blessings much increase, for the kindness that thou\nhast showed to me.\n\n{140} Then he began to go forward; but Discretion, Piety, Charity,\nand Prudence would accompany him down to the foot of the hill.  So\nthey went on together, reiterating their former discourses, till\nthey came to go down the hill.  Then said Christian, As it was\ndifficult coming up, so, so far as I can see, it is dangerous going\ndown.  Yes, said Prudence, so it is, for it is a hard matter for\na man to go down into the Valley of Humiliation, as thou art now,\nand to catch no slip by the way; therefore, said they, are we come\nout to accompany thee down the hill.  So he began to go down, but\nvery warily; yet he caught a slip or two.\n\n{141} Then I saw in my dream that these good companions, when\nChristian was gone to the bottom of the hill, gave him a loaf of\nbread, a bottle of wine, and a cluster of raisins; and then he went\non his way.\n\nBut now, in this Valley of Humiliation, poor Christian was hard put\nto it; for he had gone but a little way, before he espied a foul\nfiend coming over the field to meet him; his name is Apollyon.  Then\ndid Christian begin to be afraid, and to cast in his mind whether\nto go back or to stand his ground.  But he considered again that\nhe had no armour for his back; and therefore thought that to turn\nthe back to him might give him the greater advantage with ease to\npierce him with his darts.\n\nChristian's resolution at the approach of Apollyon\n\nTherefore he resolved to venture and stand his ground; for, thought\nhe, had I no more in mine eye than the saving of my life, it would\nbe the best way to stand.\n\n{142} So he went on, and Apollyon met him.  Now the monster was\nhideous to behold; he was clothed with scales, like a fish, (and\nthey are his pride,) he had wings like a dragon, feet like a bear,\nand out of his belly came fire and smoke, and his mouth was as the\nmouth of a lion.  When he was come up to Christian, he beheld him\nwith a disdainful countenance, and thus began to question with him.\n\n{143} APOL. Whence come you?  and whither are you bound?\n\nCHR. I am come from the City of Destruction, which is the place of\nall evil, and am going to the City of Zion.\n\nAPOL. By this I perceive thou art one of my subjects, for all that\ncountry is mine, and I am the prince and god of it.  How is it,\nthen, that thou hast run away from thy king?  Were it not that I\nhope thou mayest do me more service, I would strike thee now, at\none blow, to the ground.\n\n{144} CHR. I was born, indeed, in your dominions, but your service\nwas hard, and your wages such as a man could not live on, \"for the\nwages of sin is death\" [Rom 6:23]; therefore, when I was come to\nyears, I did, as other considerate persons do, look out, if, perhaps,\nI might mend myself.\n\nApollyon's flattery\n\nAPOL. There is no prince that will thus lightly lose his subjects,\nneither will I as yet lose thee; but since thou complainest of thy\nservice and wages, be content to go back:  what our country will\nafford, I do here promise to give thee.\n\nCHR. But I have let myself to another, even to the King of princes;\nand how can I, with fairness, go back with thee?\n\n{145} APOL. Thou hast done in this, according to the proverb,\n\"Changed a bad for a worse\"; but it is ordinary for those that\nhave professed themselves his servants, after a while to give him\nthe slip, and return again to me.  Do thou so too, and all shall\nbe well.\n\nCHR. I have given him my faith, and sworn my allegiance to him;\nhow, then, can I go back from this, and not be hanged as a traitor?\n\nAPOL. Thou didst the same to me, and yet I am willing to pass by\nall, if now thou wilt yet turn again and go back.\n\n{146} CHR. What I promised thee was in my nonage; and, besides, I\ncount the Prince under whose banner now I stand is able to absolve\nme; yea, and to pardon also what I did as to my compliance with\nthee; and besides, O thou destroying Apollyon!  to speak truth,\nI like his service, his wages, his servants, his government, his\ncompany, and country, better than thine; and, therefore, leave off\nto persuade me further; I am his servant, and I will follow him.\n\n{147} APOL. Consider, again, when thou art in cool blood, what thou\nart like to meet with in the way that thou goest.  Thou knowest\nthat, for the most part, his servants come to an ill end, because\nthey are transgressors against me and my ways.  How many of them\nhave been put to shameful deaths!  and, besides, thou countest his\nservice better than mine, whereas he never came yet from the place\nwhere he is to deliver any that served him out of their hands; but\nas for me, how many times, as all the world very well knows, have\nI delivered, either by power, or fraud, those that have faithfully\nserved me, from him and his, though taken by them; and so I will\ndeliver thee.\n\nCHR. His forbearing at present to deliver them is on purpose to try\ntheir love, whether they will cleave to him to the end; and as for\nthe ill end thou sayest they come to, that is most glorious in their\naccount; for, for present deliverance, they do not much expect it,\nfor they stay for their glory, and then they shall have it when\ntheir Prince comes in his and the glory of the angels.\n\nAPOL. Thou hast already been unfaithful in thy service to him; and\nhow dost thou think to receive wages of him?\n\nCHR. Wherein, O Apollyon!  have I been unfaithful to him?\n\n{148} APOL. Thou didst faint at first setting out, when thou wast\nalmost choked in the Gulf of Despond; thou didst attempt wrong ways\nto be rid of thy burden, whereas thou shouldst have stayed till\nthy Prince had taken it off; thou didst sinfully sleep and lose\nthy choice thing; thou wast, also, almost persuaded to go back at\nthe sight of the lions; and when thou talkest of thy journey, and\nof what thou hast heard and seen, thou art inwardly desirous of\nvain-glory in all that thou sayest or doest.\n\nCHR. All this is true, and much more which thou hast left out;\nbut the Prince whom I serve and honour is merciful, and ready to\nforgive; but, besides, these infirmities possessed me in thy country,\nfor there I sucked them in; and I have groaned under them, been\nsorry for them, and have obtained pardon of my Prince.\n\n{149} APOL. Then Apollyon broke out into a grievous rage, saying,\nI am an enemy to this Prince; I hate his person, his laws, and\npeople; I am come out on purpose to withstand thee.\n\nCHR. Apollyon, beware what you do; for I am in the King's highway,\nthe way of holiness; therefore take heed to yourself.\n\nAPOL. Then Apollyon straddled quite over the whole breadth of the\nway, and said, I am void of fear in this matter:  prepare thyself\nto die; for I swear by my infernal den, that thou shalt go no\nfurther; here will I spill thy soul.\n\n{150} And with that he threw a flaming dart at his breast; but\nChristian had a shield in his hand, with which he caught it, and\nso prevented the danger of that.\n\nThen did Christian draw, for he saw it was time to bestir him; and\nApollyon as fast made at him, throwing darts as thick as hail; by\nthe which, notwithstanding all that Christian could do to avoid it,\nApollyon wounded him in his head, his hand, and foot.  This made\nChristian give a little back; Apollyon, therefore, followed his work\namain, and Christian again took courage, and resisted as manfully\nas he could.  This sore combat lasted for above half a day, even\ntill Christian was almost quite spent; for you must know that\nChristian, by reason of his wounds, must needs grow weaker and\nweaker.\n\n{151} Then Apollyon, espying his opportunity, began to gather up\nclose to Christian, and wrestling with him, gave him a dreadful\nfall; and with that Christian's sword flew out of his hand.  Then\nsaid Apollyon, I am sure of thee now.  And with that he had almost\npressed him to death, so that Christian began to despair of life;\nbut as God would have it, while Apollyon was fetching of his\nlast blow, thereby to make a full end of this good man, Christian\nnimbly stretched out his hand for his sword, and caught it, saying,\n\"Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy; when I fall I shall arise\"\n[Micah 7:8];\n\nChristian's victory over Apollyon\n\nand with that gave him a deadly thrust, which made him give back,\nas one that had received his mortal wound.  Christian perceiving\nthat, made at him again, saying, \"Nay, in all these things we are\nmore than conquerors through him that loved us\".  [Rom. 8:37] And\nwith that Apollyon spread forth his dragon's wings, and sped him\naway, that Christian for a season saw him no more.  [James 4:7]\n\n{152} In this combat no man can imagine, unless he had seen and\nheard as I did, what yelling and hideous roaring Apollyon made all\nthe time of the fight--he spake like a dragon; and, on the other\nside, what sighs and groans burst from Christian's heart.  I never\nsaw him all the while give so much as one pleasant look, till he\nperceived he had wounded Apollyon with his two-edged sword; then,\nindeed, he did smile, and look upward; but it was the dreadfullest\nsight that ever I saw.\n\nA more unequal match can hardly be,--CHRISTIAN must fight an\nAngel; but you see,\n\n  The valiant man by handling Sword and Shield,\n  Doth make him, tho' a Dragon, quit the field.\n\n\n{153} So when the battle was over, Christian said, \"I will here\ngive thanks to him that delivered me out of the mouth of the lion,\nto him that did help me against Apollyon.\"  And so he did, saying--\n\n  Great Beelzebub, the captain of this fiend,\n  Design'd my ruin; therefore to this end\n  He sent him harness'd out:  and he with rage\n  That hellish was, did fiercely me engage.\n  But blessed Michael helped me, and I,\n  By dint of sword, did quickly make him fly.\n  Therefore to him let me give lasting praise,\n  And thank and bless his holy name always.\n\n\n{154} Then there came to him a hand, with some of the leaves of the\ntree of life, the which Christian took, and applied to the wounds\nthat he had received in the battle, and was healed immediately.\nHe also sat down in that place to eat bread, and to drink of the\nbottle that was given him a little before; so, being refreshed,\nhe addressed himself to his journey, with his sword drawn in his\nhand; for he said, I know not but some other enemy may be at hand.\nBut he met with no other affront from Apollyon quite through this\nvalley.\n\n{155} Now, at the end of this valley was another, called the Valley\nof the Shadow of Death, and Christian must needs go through it,\nbecause the way to the Celestial City lay through the midst of it.\nNow, this valley is a very solitary place.  The prophet Jeremiah\nthus describes it:  \"A wilderness, a land of deserts and of pits,\na land of drought, and of the shadow of death, a land that no man\"\n(but a Christian) \"passed through, and where no man dwelt.\"  [Jer.\n2:6]\n\nNow here Christian was worse put to it than in his fight with\nApollyon, as by the sequel you shall see.\n\n{156} I saw then in my dream, that when Christian was got to the\nborders of the Shadow of Death, there met him two men, children of\nthem that brought up an evil report of the good land [Num. 13],\nmaking haste to go back; to whom Christian spake as follows:--\n\n{157} CHR. Whither are you going?\n\nMEN. They said, Back!  back!  and we would have you to do so too,\nif either life or peace is prized by you.\n\nCHR. Why, what's the matter?  said Christian.\n\nMEN. Matter!  said they; we were going that way as you are going,\nand went as far as we durst; and indeed we were almost past coming\nback; for had we gone a little further, we had not been here to\nbring the news to thee.\n\nCHR. But what have you met with?  said Christian.\n\nMEN. Why, we were almost in the Valley of the Shadow of Death; but\nthat, by good hap, we looked before us, and saw the danger before\nwe came to it.  [Ps. 44:19; 107:10]\n\nCHR. But what have you seen?  said Christian.\n\n{158} MEN. Seen!  Why, the Valley itself, which is as dark as pitch;\nwe also saw there the hobgoblins, satyrs, and dragons of the pit;\nwe heard also in that Valley a continual howling and yelling, as of\na people under unutterable misery, who there sat bound in affliction\nand irons; and over that Valley hangs the discouraging clouds of\nconfusion.  Death also doth always spread his wings over it.  In\na word, it is every whit dreadful, being utterly without order.\n[Job 3:5; 10:22]\n\nCHR. Then, said Christian, I perceive not yet, by what you have\nsaid, but that this is my way to the desired haven.  [Jer. 2:6]\n\nMEN. Be it thy way; we will not choose it for ours.  So, they parted,\nand Christian went on his way, but still with his sword drawn in\nhis hand, for fear lest he should be assaulted.\n\n{159} I saw then in my dream, so far as this valley reached, there\nwas on the right hand a very deep ditch; that ditch is it into\nwhich the blind have led the blind in all ages, and have both there\nmiserably perished.  [Ps. 69:14,15] Again, behold, on the left\nhand, there was a very dangerous quag, into which, if even a good\nman falls, he can find no bottom for his foot to stand on.  Into\nthat quag King David once did fall, and had no doubt therein been\nsmothered, had not HE that is able plucked him out.\n\n{160} The pathway was here also exceeding narrow, and therefore\ngood Christian was the more put to it; for when he sought, in the\ndark, to shun the ditch on the one hand, he was ready to tip over\ninto the mire on the other; also when he sought to escape the mire,\nwithout great carefulness he would be ready to fall into the ditch.\nThus he went on, and I heard him here sigh bitterly; for, besides\nthe dangers mentioned above, the pathway was here so dark, and\nofttimes, when he lift up his foot to set forward, he knew not\nwhere or upon what he should set it next.\n\n\n  Poor man!  where art thou now?  thy day is night.\n  Good man, be not cast down, thou yet art right,\n  Thy way to heaven lies by the gates of Hell;\n  Cheer up, hold out, with thee it shall go well.\n\n\n{161} About the midst of this valley, I perceived the mouth of\nhell to be, and it stood also hard by the wayside.  Now, thought\nChristian, what shall I do?  And ever and anon the flame and smoke\nwould come out in such abundance, with sparks and hideous noises,\n(things that cared not for Christian's sword, as did Apollyon\nbefore), that he was forced to put up his sword, and betake himself\nto another weapon called All-prayer.  [Eph. 6:18] So he cried in my\nhearing, \"O Lord, I beseech thee, deliver my soul!\"  [Ps. 116:4]\nThus he went on a great while, yet still the flames would be\nreaching towards him.  Also he heard doleful voices, and rushings\nto and fro, so that sometimes he thought he should be torn in\npieces, or trodden down like mire in the streets.  This frightful\nsight was seen, and these dreadful noises were heard by him for\nseveral miles together; and, coming to a place where he thought he\nheard a company of fiends coming forward to meet him, he stopped,\nand began to muse what he had best to do.  Sometimes he had half\na thought to go back; then again he thought he might be half way\nthrough the valley; he remembered also how he had already vanquished\nmany a danger, and that the danger of going back might be much more\nthan for to go forward; so he resolved to go on.  Yet the fiends\nseemed to come nearer and nearer; but when they were come even\nalmost at him, he cried out with a most vehement voice, \"I will walk\nin the strength of the Lord God!\"  so they gave back, and came no\nfurther.\n\n{162} One thing I would not let slip.  I took notice that now poor\nChristian was so confounded, that he did not know his own voice;\nand thus I perceived it.  Just when he was come over against the\nmouth of the burning pit, one of the wicked ones got behind him, and\nstepped up softly to him, and whisperingly suggested many grievous\nblasphemies to him, which he verily thought had proceeded from his\nown mind.  This put Christian more to it than anything that he met\nwith before, even to think that he should now blaspheme him that\nhe loved so much before; yet, if he could have helped it, he would\nnot have done it; but he had not the discretion either to stop his\nears, or to know from whence these blasphemies came.\n\n{163} When Christian had travelled in this disconsolate condition\nsome considerable time, he thought he heard the voice of a man,\nas going before him, saying, \"Though I walk through the valley of\nthe shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me.\"\n[Ps. 23:4]\n\n{164} Then he was glad, and that for these reasons:\n\nFirst, Because he gathered from thence, that some who feared God\nwere in this valley as well as himself.\n\nSecondly, For that he perceived God was with them, though in that\ndark and dismal state; and why not, thought he, with me?  though,\nby reason of the impediment that attends this place, I cannot\nperceive it.  [Job 9:11]\n\nThirdly, For that he hoped, could he overtake them, to have company\nby and by.  So he went on, and called to him that was before; but\nhe knew not what to answer; for that he also thought to be alone.\nAnd by and by the day broke; then said Christian, He hath turned\n\"the shadow of death into the morning\".  [Amos 5:8]\n\n{165} Now morning being come, he looked back, not out of desire to\nreturn, but to see, by the light of the day, what hazards he had\ngone through in the dark.  So he saw more perfectly the ditch that\nwas on the one hand, and the mire that was on the other; also how\nnarrow the way was which led betwixt them both; also now he saw the\nhobgoblins, and satyrs, and dragons of the pit, but all afar off,\n(for after break of day, they came not nigh;) yet they were discovered\nto him, according to that which is written, \"He discovereth deep\nthings out of darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of\ndeath.\"  [Job 12:22]\n\n{166} Now was Christian much affected with his deliverance from all\nthe dangers of his solitary way; which dangers, though he feared\nthem more before, yet he saw them more clearly now, because the light\nof the day made them conspicuous to him.  And about this time the\nsun was rising, and this was another mercy to Christian; for you\nmust note, that though the first part of the Valley of the Shadow\nof Death was dangerous, yet this second part which he was yet to\ngo, was, if possible, far more dangerous; for from the place where\nhe now stood, even to the end of the valley, the way was all along\nset so full of snares, traps, gins, and nets here, and so full of\npits, pitfalls, deep holes, and shelvings down there, that, had it\nnow been dark, as it was when he came the first part of the way,\nhad he had a thousand souls, they had in reason been cast away; but,\nas I said just now, the sun was rising.  Then said he, \"His candle\nshineth upon my head, and by his light I walk through darkness.\"\n[Job 29:3]\n\n{167} In this light, therefore, he came to the end of the valley.\nNow I saw in my dream, that at the end of this valley lay blood,\nbones, ashes, and mangled bodies of men, even of pilgrims that had\ngone this way formerly; and while I was musing what should be the\nreason, I espied a little before me a cave, where two giants, POPE\nand PAGAN, dwelt in old time; by whose power and tyranny the men\nwhose bones, blood, and ashes, &c., lay there, were cruelly put\nto death.  But by this place Christian went without much danger,\nwhereat I somewhat wondered; but I have learnt since, that PAGAN\nhas been dead many a day; and as for the other, though he be yet\nalive, he is, by reason of age, and also of the many shrewd brushes\nthat he met with in his younger days, grown so crazy and stiff in\nhis joints, that he can now do little more than sit in his cave's\nmouth, grinning at pilgrims as they go by, and biting his nails\nbecause he cannot come at them.\n\n{168} So I saw that Christian went on his way; yet, at the sight of\nthe Old Man that sat in the mouth of the cave, he could not tell\nwhat to think, especially because he spake to him, though he could\nnot go after him, saying, \"You will never mend till more of you be\nburned.\"  But he held his peace, and set a good face on it, and so\nwent by and catched no hurt.  Then sang Christian:\n\n  O world of wonders!  (I can say no less),\n  That I should be preserved in that distress\n  That I have met with here!  O blessed be\n  That hand that from it hath deliver'd me!\n  Dangers in darkness, devils, hell, and sin\n  Did compass me, while I this vale was in:\n  Yea, snares, and pits, and traps, and nets, did lie\n  My path about, that worthless, silly I\n  Might have been catch'd, entangled, and cast down;\n  But since I live, let JESUS wear the crown.\n\n\n{169} Now, as Christian went on his way, he came to a little ascent,\nwhich was cast up on purpose that pilgrims might see before them.\nUp there, therefore, Christian went, and looking forward, he saw\nFaithful before him, upon his journey.  Then said Christian aloud,\n\"Ho!  ho!  So-ho!  stay, and I will be your companion!\"  At that,\nFaithful looked behind him; to whom Christian cried again, \"Stay,\nstay, till I come up to you!\"  But Faithful answered, \"No, I am\nupon my life, and the avenger of blood is behind me.\"\n\n{170} At this, Christian was somewhat moved, and putting to all\nhis strength, he quickly got up with Faithful, and did also overrun\nhim; so the last was first.  Then did Christian vain-gloriously\nsmile, because he had gotten the start of his brother; but not\ntaking good heed to his feet, he suddenly stumbled and fell, and\ncould not rise again until Faithful came up to help him.\n\nChristian's fall makes Faithful and he go lovingly together\n\nThen I saw in my dream they went very lovingly on together, and had\nsweet discourse of all things that had happened to them in their\npilgrimage; and thus Christian began:\n\n{171} CHR. My honoured and well-beloved brother, Faithful, I am\nglad that I have overtaken you; and that God has so tempered our\nspirits, that we can walk as companions in this so pleasant a path.\n\nFAITH. I had thought, dear friend, to have had your company quite\nfrom our town; but you did get the start of me, wherefore I was\nforced to come thus much of the way alone.\n\nCHR. How long did you stay in the City of Destruction before you\nset out after me on your pilgrimage?\n\nFAITH. Till I could stay no longer; for there was great talk presently\nafter you were gone out that our city would, in short time, with\nfire from heaven, be burned down to the ground.\n\nCHR. What!  did your neighbours talk so?\n\nFAITH. Yes, it was for a while in everybody's mouth.\n\nCHR. What!  and did no more of them but you come out to escape the\ndanger?\n\nFAITH. Though there was, as I said, a great talk thereabout, yet\nI do not think they did firmly believe it.  For in the heat of the\ndiscourse, I heard some of them deridingly speak of you and of your\ndesperate journey, (for so they called this your pilgrimage), but\nI did believe, and do still, that the end of our city will be with\nfire and brimstone from above; and therefore I have made my\nescape.\n\n{172} CHR. Did you hear no talk of neighbour Pliable?\n\nFAITH. Yes, Christian, I heard that he followed you till he came\nat the Slough of Despond, where, as some said, he fell in; but he\nwould not be known to have so done; but I am sure he was soundly\nbedabbled with that kind of dirt.\n\nCHR. And what said the neighbours to him?\n\nFAITH. He hath, since his going back, been had greatly in derision,\nand that among all sorts of people; some do mock and despise him;\nand scarce will any set him on work.  He is now seven times worse\nthan if he had never gone out of the city.\n\nCHR. But why should they be so set against him, since they also\ndespise the way that he forsook?\n\nFAITH. Oh, they say, hang him, he is a turncoat!  he was not true\nto his profession.  I think God has stirred up even his enemies to\nhiss at him, and make him a proverb, because he hath forsaken the\nway.  [Jer. 29:18,19]\n\nCHR. Had you no talk with him before you came out?\n\nFAITH. I met him once in the streets, but he leered away on the\nother side, as one ashamed of what he had done; so I spake not to\nhim.\n\n{173} CHR. Well, at my first setting out, I had hopes of that man;\nbut now I fear he will perish in the overthrow of the city; for\nit is happened to him according to the true proverb, \"The dog is\nturned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed, to her\nwallowing in the mire.\"  [2 Pet. 2:22]\n\nFAITH. These are my fears of him too; but who can hinder that which\nwill be?\n\nCHR. Well, neighbour Faithful, said Christian, let us leave him,\nand talk of things that more immediately concern ourselves.  Tell\nme now, what you have met with in the way as you came; for I know\nyou have met with some things, or else it may be writ for a wonder.\n\n{174} FAITH. I escaped the Slough that I perceived you fell into,\nand got up to the gate without that danger; only I met with one\nwhose name was Wanton, who had like to have done me a mischief.\n\nCHR. It was well you escaped her net; Joseph was hard put to it by\nher, and he escaped her as you did; but it had like to have cost\nhim his life.  [Gen. 39:11-13] But what did she do to you?\n\nFAITH. You cannot think, but that you know something, what a\nflattering tongue she had; she lay at me hard to turn aside with\nher, promising me all manner of content.\n\nCHR. Nay, she did not promise you the content of a good conscience.\n\nFAITH. You know what I mean; all carnal and fleshly content.\n\nCHR. Thank God you have escaped her:  \"The abhorred of the Lord\nshall fall into her ditch.\"  [Ps. 22:14]\n\nFAITH. Nay, I know not whether I did wholly escape her or no.\n\nCHR. Why, I trow, you did not consent to her desires?\n\nFAITH. No, not to defile myself; for I remembered an old writing\nthat I had seen, which said, \"Her steps take hold on hell.\"  [Prov.\n5:5] So I shut mine eyes, because I would not be bewitched with\nher looks.  [Job 31:1] Then she railed on me, and I went my way.\n\nCHR. Did you meet with no other assault as you came?\n\n{175} FAITH. When I came to the foot of the hill called Difficulty,\nI met with a very aged man, who asked me what I was, and whither\nbound.  I told him that I am a pilgrim, going to the Celestial\nCity.  Then said the old man, Thou lookest like an honest fellow;\nwilt thou be content to dwell with me for the wages that I shall\ngive thee?  Then I asked him his name, and where he dwelt.  He\nsaid his name was Adam the First, and that he dwelt in the town\nof Deceit.  [Eph. 4:22] I asked him then what was his work, and\nwhat the wages he would give.  He told me that his work was many\ndelights; and his wages that I should be his heir at last.  I further\nasked him what house he kept, and what other servants he had.  So\nhe told me that his house was maintained with all the dainties in\nthe world; and that his servants were those of his own begetting.\nThen I asked if he had any children.  He said that he had but three\ndaughters:  The Lust of the Flesh, The Lust of the Eyes, and The\nPride of Life, and that I should marry them all if I would.  [1\nJohn 2:16] Then I asked how long time he would have me live with\nhim?  And he told me, As long as he lived himself.\n\nCHR. Well, and what conclusion came the old man and you to at last?\n\nFAITH. Why, at first, I found myself somewhat inclinable to go\nwith the man, for I thought he spake very fair; but looking in his\nforehead, as I talked with him, I saw there written, \"Put off the\nold man with his deeds.\"\n\nCHR. And how then?\n\n{176} FAITH. Then it came burning hot into my mind, whatever he\nsaid, and however he flattered, when he got me home to his house,\nhe would sell me for a slave.  So I bid him forbear to talk, for\nI would not come near the door of his house.  Then he reviled me,\nand told me that he would send such a one after me, that should\nmake my way bitter to my soul.  So I turned to go away from him;\nbut just as I turned myself to go thence, I felt him take hold of\nmy flesh, and give me such a deadly twitch back, that I thought he\nhad pulled part of me after himself.  This made me cry, \"O wretched\nman!\"  [Rom. 7:24] So I went on my way up the hill.\n\nNow when I had got about half-way up, I looked behind, and saw one\ncoming after me, swift as the wind; so he overtook me just about\nthe place where the settle stands.\n\nCHR. Just there, said Christian, did I sit down to rest me; but\nbeing overcome with sleep, I there lost this roll out of my bosom.\n\n{177} FAITH. But, good brother, hear me out.  So soon as the man\novertook me, he was but a word and a blow, for down he knocked\nme, and laid me for dead.  But when I was a little come to myself\nagain, I asked him wherefore he served me so.  He said, because of\nmy secret inclining to Adam the First; and with that he struck me\nanother deadly blow on the breast, and beat me down backward; so\nI lay at his foot as dead as before.  So, when I came to myself\nagain, I cried him mercy; but he said, I know not how to show mercy;\nand with that he knocked me down again.  He had doubtless made an\nend of me, but that one came by, and bid him forbear.\n\nCHR. Who was that that bid him forbear?\n\nFAITH. I did not know him at first, but as he went by, I perceived\nthe holes in his hands and in his side; then I concluded that he\nwas our Lord.  So I went up the hill.\n\n{178} CHR. That man that overtook you was Moses.  He spareth none,\nneither knoweth he how to show mercy to those that transgress his\nlaw.\n\nFAITH. I know it very well; it was not the first time that he has\nmet with me.  It was he that came to me when I dwelt securely at\nhome, and that told me he would burn my house over my head if I\nstayed there.\n\nCHR. But did you not see the house that stood there on the top of\nthe hill, on the side of which Moses met you?\n\nFAITH. Yes, and the lions too, before I came at it:  but for the\nlions, I think they were asleep, for it was about noon; and because\nI had so much of the day before me, I passed by the porter, and\ncame down the hill.\n\nCHR. He told me, indeed, that he saw you go by, but I wish you\nhad called at the house, for they would have showed you so many\nrarities, that you would scarce have forgot them to the day of\nyour death.  But pray tell me, Did you meet nobody in the Valley\nof Humility?\n\n{179} FAITH. Yes, I met with one Discontent, who would willingly\nhave persuaded me to go back again with him; his reason was, for\nthat the valley was altogether without honour.  He told me, moreover,\nthat there to go was the way to disobey all my friends, as Pride,\nArrogancy, Self-conceit, Worldly-glory, with others, who he knew,\nas he said, would be very much offended, if I made such a fool of\nmyself as to wade through this valley.\n\nCHR. Well, and how did you answer him?\n\n{180} Faithful's answer to Discontent\n\nFAITH. I told him, that although all these that he named might claim\nkindred of me, and that rightly, for indeed they were my relations\naccording to the flesh; yet since I became a pilgrim, they have\ndisowned me, as I also have rejected them; and therefore they were\nto me now no more than if they had never been of my lineage.\n\nI told him, moreover, that as to this valley, he had quite misrepresented\nthe thing; for before honour is humility, and a haughty spirit\nbefore a fall.  Therefore, said I, I had rather go through this\nvalley to the honour that was so accounted by the wisest, than\nchoose that which he esteemed most worthy our affections.\n\nCHR. Met you with nothing else in that valley?\n\n{181} FAITH. Yes, I met with Shame; but of all the men that I met\nwith in my pilgrimage, he, I think, bears the wrong name.  The\nothers would be said nay, after a little argumentation, and somewhat\nelse; but this bold-faced Shame would never have done.\n\nCHR. Why, what did he say to you?\n\nFAITH. What!  why, he objected against religion itself; he said it\nwas a pitiful, low, sneaking business for a man to mind religion;\nhe said that a tender conscience was an unmanly thing; and that\nfor a man to watch over his words and ways, so as to tie up himself\nfrom that hectoring liberty that the brave spirits of the times\naccustom themselves unto, would make him the ridicule of the times.\nHe objected also, that but few of the mighty, rich, or wise, were\never of my opinion [1 Cor. 1:26; 3:18; Phil. 3:7,8]; nor any of\nthem neither [John 7:48], before they were persuaded to be fools,\nand to be of a voluntary fondness, to venture the loss of all, for\nnobody knows what.  He, moreover, objected the base and low estate\nand condition of those that were chiefly the pilgrims of the times\nin which they lived:  also their ignorance and want of understanding\nin all natural science.  Yea, he did hold me to it at that rate\nalso, about a great many more things than here I relate; as, that\nit was a shame to sit whining and mourning under a sermon, and\na shame to come sighing and groaning home:  that it was a shame to\nask my neighbour forgiveness for petty faults, or to make restitution\nwhere I have taken from any.  He said, also, that religion made\na man grow strange to the great, because of a few vices, which\nhe called by finer names; and made him own and respect the base,\nbecause of the same religious fraternity.  And is not this, said\nhe, a shame?\n\n{182} CHR. And what did you say to him?\n\nFAITH. Say!  I could not tell what to say at the first.  Yea, he\nput me so to it, that my blood came up in my face; even this Shame\nfetched it up, and had almost beat me quite off.  But at last I\nbegan to consider, that \"that which is highly esteemed among men,\nis had in abomination with God.\"  [Luke 16:15] And I thought again,\nthis Shame tells me what men are; but it tells me nothing what God\nor the Word of God is.  And I thought, moreover, that at the day\nof doom, we shall not be doomed to death or life according to the\nhectoring spirits of the world, but according to the wisdom and\nlaw of the Highest.  Therefore, thought I, what God says is best,\nindeed is best, though all the men in the world are against it.\nSeeing, then, that God prefers his religion; seeing God prefers a\ntender conscience; seeing they that make themselves fools for the\nkingdom of heaven are wisest; and that the poor man that loveth\nChrist is richer than the greatest man in the world that hates\nhim; Shame, depart, thou art an enemy to my salvation!  Shall I\nentertain thee against my sovereign Lord?  How then shall I look\nhim in the face at his coming?  Should I now be ashamed of his\nways and servants, how can I expect the blessing?  [Mark 8:38] But,\nindeed, this Shame was a bold villain; I could scarce shake him\nout of my company; yea, he would be haunting of me, and continually\nwhispering me in the ear, with some one or other of the infirmities\nthat attend religion; but at last I told him it was but in vain to\nattempt further in this business; for those things that he disdained,\nin those did I see most glory; and so at last I got past this\nimportunate one.  And when I had shaken him off, then I began to\nsing--\n\n  The trials that those men do meet withal,\n  That are obedient to the heavenly call,\n  Are manifold, and suited to the flesh,\n  And come, and come, and come again afresh;\n  That now, or sometime else, we by them may\n  Be taken, overcome, and cast away.\n  Oh, let the pilgrims, let the pilgrims, then\n  Be vigilant, and quit themselves like men.\n\n\n{183} CHR. I am glad, my brother, that thou didst withstand this\nvillain so bravely; for of all, as thou sayest, I think he has the\nwrong name; for he is so bold as to follow us in the streets, and\nto attempt to put us to shame before all men:  that is, to make us\nashamed of that which is good; but if he was not himself audacious,\nhe would never attempt to do as he does.  But let us still resist\nhim; for notwithstanding all his bravadoes, he promoteth the fool\nand none else.  \"The wise shall inherit glory, said Solomon, but\nshame shall be the promotion of fools.\"  [Prov. 3:35]\n\nFAITH. I think we must cry to Him for help against Shame, who would\nhave us to be valiant for the truth upon the earth.\n\nCHR. You say true; but did you meet nobody else in that valley?\n\nFAITH. No, not I; for I had sunshine all the rest of the way through\nthat, and also through the Valley of the Shadow of Death.\n\n{184} CHR. It was well for you.  I am sure it fared far otherwise\nwith me; I had for a long season, as soon almost as I entered into\nthat valley, a dreadful combat with that foul fiend Apollyon; yea,\nI thought verily he would have killed me, especially when he got\nme down and crushed me under him, as if he would have crushed me\nto pieces; for as he threw me, my sword flew out of my hand; nay,\nhe told me he was sure of me:  but I cried to God, and he heard\nme, and delivered me out of all my troubles.  Then I entered into\nthe Valley of the Shadow of Death, and had no light for almost half\nthe way through it.  I thought I should have been killed there,\nover and over; but at last day broke, and the sun rose, and I went\nthrough that which was behind with far more ease and quiet.\n\n{185} Moreover, I saw in my dream, that as they went on, Faithful,\nas he chanced to look on one side, saw a man whose name is Talkative,\nwalking at a distance beside them; for in this place there was room\nenough for them all to walk.  He was a tall man, and something more\ncomely at a distance than at hand.  To this man Faithful addressed\nhimself in this manner:\n\nFAITH. Friend, whither away?  Are you going to the heavenly country?\n\nTALK. I am going to the same place.\n\nFAITH. That is well; then I hope we may have your good company.\n\nTALK. With a very good will will I be your companion.\n\n{186} FAITH. Come on, then, and let us go together, and let us\nspend our time in discoursing of things that are profitable.\n\nTalkative's dislike of bad discourse\n\nTALK. To talk of things that are good, to me is very acceptable,\nwith you or with any other; and I am glad that I have met with those\nthat incline to so good a work; for, to speak the truth, there are\nbut few that care thus to spend their time, (as they are in their\ntravels), but choose much rather to be speaking of things to no\nprofit; and this hath been a trouble for me.\n\nFAITH. That is indeed a thing to be lamented; for what things so\nworthy of the use of the tongue and mouth of men on earth as are\nthe things of the God of heaven?\n\nTALK. I like you wonderful well, for your sayings are full of\nconviction; and I will add, what thing is so pleasant, and what\nso profitable, as to talk of the things of God?  What things so\npleasant (that is, if a man hath any delight in things that are\nwonderful)?  For instance, if a man doth delight to talk of the\nhistory or the mystery of things; or if a man doth love to talk of\nmiracles, wonders, or signs, where shall he find things recorded\nso delightful, and so sweetly penned, as in the Holy Scripture?\n\n{187} FAITH. That is true; but to be profited by such things in\nour talk should be that which we design.\n\nTalkative's fine discourse\n\nTALK. That is it that I said; for to talk of such things is most\nprofitable; for by so doing, a man may get knowledge of many things;\nas of the vanity of earthly things, and the benefit of things above.\nThus, in general, but more particularly by this, a man may learn\nthe necessity of the new birth, the insufficiency of our works,\nthe need of Christ's righteousness, &c.  Besides, by this a man\nmay learn, by talk, what it is to repent, to believe, to pray,\nto suffer, or the like; by this also a man may learn what are the\ngreat promises and consolations of the gospel, to his own comfort.\nFurther, by this a man may learn to refute false opinions, to\nvindicate the truth, and also to instruct the ignorant.\n\nFAITH. All this is true, and glad am I to hear these things from\nyou.\n\nTALK. Alas!  the want of this is the cause why so few understand\nthe need of faith, and the necessity of a work of grace in their\nsoul, in order to eternal life; but ignorantly live in the works\nof the law, by which a man can by no means obtain the kingdom of\nheaven.\n\n{188} FAITH. But, by your leave, heavenly knowledge of these is the\ngift of God; no man attaineth to them by human industry, or only\nby the talk of them.\n\nTALK. All this I know very well; for a man can receive nothing,\nexcept it be given him from Heaven; all is of grace, not of works.\nI could give you a hundred scriptures for the confirmation of this.\n\nFAITH. Well, then, said Faithful, what is that one thing that we\nshall at this time found our discourse upon?\n\nTALK. What you will.  I will talk of things heavenly, or things\nearthly; things moral, or things evangelical; things sacred, or\nthings profane; things past, or things to come; things foreign, or\nthings at home; things more essential, or things circumstantial;\nprovided that all be done to our profit.\n\n{189} FAITH. Now did Faithful begin to wonder; and stepping to\nChristian, (for he walked all this while by himself), he said to\nhim, (but softly), What a brave companion have we got!  Surely this\nman will make a very excellent pilgrim.\n\nCHR. At this Christian modestly smiled, and said, This man, with\nwhom you are so taken, will beguile, with that tongue of his, twenty\nof them that know him not.\n\nFAITH. Do you know him, then?\n\n{190} CHR. Know him!  Yes, better than he knows himself.\n\nFAITH. Pray, what is he?\n\nCHR. His name is Talkative; he dwelleth in our town.  I wonder that\nyou should be a stranger to him, only I consider that our town is\nlarge.\n\nFAITH. Whose son is he?  And whereabout does he dwell?\n\nCHR. He is the son of one Say-well; he dwelt in Prating Row; and is\nknown of all that are acquainted with him, by the name of Talkative\nin Prating Row; and notwithstanding his fine tongue, he is but a\nsorry fellow.\n\n{191} FAITH. Well, he seems to be a very pretty man.\n\nCHR. That is, to them who have not thorough acquaintance with him;\nfor he is best abroad; near home, he is ugly enough.  Your saying\nthat he is a pretty man, brings to my mind what I have observed in\nthe work of the painter, whose pictures show best at a distance,\nbut, very near, more unpleasing.\n\n{192} FAITH. But I am ready to think you do but jest, because you\nsmiled.\n\nCHR. God forbid that I should jest (although I smiled) in this\nmatter, or that I should accuse any falsely!  I will give you\na further discovery of him.  This man is for any company, and for\nany talk; as he talketh now with you, so will he talk when he is on\nthe ale-bench; and the more drink he hath in his crown, the more\nof these things he hath in his mouth; religion hath no place in his\nheart, or house, or conversation; all he hath lieth in his tongue,\nand his religion is, to make a noise therewith.\n\n{193} FAITH. Say you so!  then am I in this man greatly deceived.\n\nCHR. Deceived!  you may be sure of it; remember the proverb, \"They\nsay and do not.\"  [Matt. 23:3] But the kingdom of God is not in\nword, but in Power.  [1 Cor 4:20] He talketh of prayer, of repentance,\nof faith, and of the new birth; but he knows but only to talk of\nthem.  I have been in his family, and have observed him both at\nhome and abroad; and I know what I say of him is the truth.  His\nhouse is as empty of religion as the white of an egg is of savour.\nThere is there neither prayer nor sign of repentance for sin; yea,\nthe brute in his kind serves God far better than he.  He is the\nvery stain, reproach, and shame of religion, to all that know him;\nit can hardly have a good word in all that end of the town where\nhe dwells, through him.  [Rom. 2:24,25] Thus say the common people\nthat know him, A saint abroad, and a devil at home.  His poor\nfamily finds it so; he is such a churl, such a railer at and so\nunreasonable with his servants, that they neither know how to do\nfor or speak to him.  Men that have any dealings with him say it is\nbetter to deal with a Turk than with him; for fairer dealing they\nshall have at their hands.  This Talkative (if it be possible) will\ngo beyond them, defraud, beguile, and overreach them.  Besides, he\nbrings up his sons to follow his steps; and if he findeth in any of\nthem a foolish timorousness, (for so he calls the first appearance\nof a tender conscience,) he calls them fools and blockheads, and by\nno means will employ them in much, or speak to their commendations\nbefore others.  For my part, I am of opinion, that he has, by his\nwicked life, caused many to stumble and fall; and will be, if God\nprevent not, the ruin of many more.\n\n{194} FAITH. Well, my brother, I am bound to believe you; not only\nbecause you say you know him, but also because, like a Christian,\nyou make your reports of men.  For I cannot think that you speak\nthese things of ill-will, but because it is even so as you say.\n\nCHR. Had I known him no more than you, I might perhaps have thought\nof him, as, at the first, you did; yea, had he received this report\nat their hands only that are enemies to religion, I should have\nthought it had been a slander,--a lot that often falls from bad\nmen's mouths upon good men's names and professions; but all these\nthings, yea, and a great many more as bad, of my own knowledge,\nI can prove him guilty of.  Besides, good men are ashamed of him;\nthey can neither call him brother, nor friend; the very naming of\nhim among them makes them blush, if they know him.\n\n{195} FAITH. Well, I see that saying and doing are two things, and\nhereafter I shall better observe this distinction.\n\nCHR. They are two things, indeed, and are as diverse as are the\nsoul and the body; for as the body without the soul is but a dead\ncarcass, so saying, if it be alone, is but a dead carcass also.\nThe soul of religion is the practical part:  \"Pure religion\nand undefiled, before God and the Father, is this, To visit the\nfatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself\nunspotted from the world.\"  [James 1:27; see vv.  22-26] This\nTalkative is not aware of; he thinks that hearing and saying will\nmake a good Christian, and thus he deceiveth his own soul.  Hearing\nis but as the sowing of the seed; talking is not sufficient to\nprove that fruit is indeed in the heart and life; and let us assure\nourselves, that at the day of doom men shall be judged according\nto their fruits.  [Matt. 13, 25] It will not be said then, Did you\nbelieve?  but, Were you doers, or talkers only?  and accordingly\nshall they be judged.  The end of the world is compared to our\nharvest; and you know men at harvest regard nothing but fruit.\nNot that anything can be accepted that is not of faith, but I speak\nthis to show you how insignificant the profession of Talkative will\nbe at that day.\n\n{196} FAITH. This brings to my mind that of Moses, by which he\ndescribeth the beast that is clean.  [Lev. 11:3-7; Deut. 14:6-8]\nHe is such a one that parteth the hoof and cheweth the cud; not\nthat parteth the hoof only, or that cheweth the cud only.  The\nhare cheweth the cud, but yet is unclean, because he parteth not\nthe hoof.  And this truly resembleth Talkative; he cheweth the cud,\nhe seeketh knowledge, he cheweth upon the word; but he divideth\nnot the hoof, he parteth not with the way of sinners; but, as the\nhare, he retaineth the foot of a dog or bear, and therefore he is\nunclean.\n\nCHR. You have spoken, for aught I know, the true gospel sense\nof those texts.  And I will add another thing:  Paul calleth some\nmen, yea, and those great talkers, too, sounding brass and tinkling\ncymbals; that is, as he expounds them in another place, things\nwithout life, giving sound.  [1 Cor. 13:1-3; 14:7] Things without\nlife, that is, without the true faith and grace of the gospel;\nand consequently, things that shall never be placed in the kingdom\nof heaven among those that are the children of life; though their\nsound, by their talk, be as if it were the tongue or voice of an\nangel.\n\nFAITH. Well, I was not so fond of his company at first, but I am\nas sick of it now.  What shall we do to be rid of him?\n\nCHR. Take my advice, and do as I bid you, and you shall find that\nhe will soon be sick of your company too, except God shall touch\nhis heart, and turn it.\n\nFAITH. What would you have me to do?\n\nCHR. Why, go to him, and enter into some serious discourse about\nthe power of religion; and ask him plainly (when he has approved\nof it, for that he will) whether this thing be set up in his heart,\nhouse, or conversation.\n\n{197} FAITH. Then Faithful stepped forward again, and said to\nTalkative, Come, what cheer?  How is it now?\n\nTALK. Thank you, well.  I thought we should have had a great deal\nof talk by this time.\n\n{198} FAITH. Well, if you will, we will fall to it now; and since\nyou left it with me to state the question, let it be this:  How doth\nthe saving grace of God discover itself when it is in the heart of\nman?\n\nTalkative's false discovery of a work of grace\n\nTALK. I perceive, then, that our talk must be about the power of\nthings.  Well, it is a very good question, and I shall be willing\nto answer you.  And take my answer in brief, thus:  First, Where\nthe grace of God is in the heart, it causeth there a great outcry\nagainst sin.  Secondly--\n\nFAITH. Nay, hold, let us consider of one at once.  I think you\nshould rather say, It shows itself by inclining the soul to abhor\nits sin.\n\nTALK. Why, what difference is there between crying out against,\nand abhorring of sin?\n\n{199} FAITH. Oh, a great deal.  A man may cry out against sin of\npolicy, but he cannot abhor it, but by virtue of a godly antipathy\nagainst it.  I have heard many cry out against sin in the pulpit,\nwho yet can abide it well enough in the heart, house, and conversation.\nJoseph's mistress cried out with a loud voice, as if she had been\nvery holy; but she would willingly, notwithstanding that, have\ncommitted uncleanness with him.  Some cry out against sin even as\nthe mother cries out against her child in her lap, when she calleth\nit slut and naughty girl, and then falls to hugging and kissing\nit.\n\nTALK. You lie at the catch, I perceive.\n\n{200} FAITH. No, not I; I am only for setting things right.  But\nwhat is the second thing whereby you would prove a discovery of a\nwork of grace in the heart?\n\nTALK. Great knowledge of gospel mysteries.\n\nFAITH. This sign should have been first; but first or last, it is\nalso false; for knowledge, great knowledge, may be obtained in the\nmysteries of the gospel, and yet no work of grace in the soul.  [1\nCor. 13] Yea, if a man have all knowledge, he may yet be nothing,\nand so consequently be no child of God.  When Christ said, \"Do you\nknow all these things?\"  and the disciples had answered, Yes; he\naddeth, \"Blessed are ye if ye do them.\"  He doth not lay the blessing\nin the knowing of them, but in the doing of them.  For there is\na knowledge that is not attended with doing:  He that knoweth his\nmasters will, and doeth it not.  A man may know like an angel, and\nyet be no Christian, therefore your sign of it is not true.  Indeed,\nto know is a thing that pleaseth talkers and boasters, but to do is\nthat which pleaseth God.  Not that the heart can be good without\nknowledge; for without that, the heart is naught.  There is,\ntherefore, knowledge and knowledge.  Knowledge that resteth in the\nbare speculation of things; and knowledge that is accompanied with\nthe grace of faith and love; which puts a man upon doing even the\nwill of God from the heart:  the first of these will serve the\ntalker; but without the other the true Christian is not content.\n\"Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall\nobserve it with my whole heart.\"  [Ps. 119:34]\n\nTALK. You lie at the catch again; this is not for edification.\n\nFAITH. Well, if you please, propound another sign how this work of\ngrace discovereth itself where it is.\n\nTALK. Not I, for I see we shall not agree.\n\nFAITH. Well, if you will not, will you give me leave to do it?\n\nTALK. You may use your liberty.\n\n{201} FAITH. A work of grace in the soul discovereth itself, either\nto him that hath it, or to standers by.\n\nTo him that hath it thus:  It gives him conviction of sin, especially\nof the defilement of his nature and the sin of unbelief, (for the\nsake of which he is sure to be damned, if he findeth not mercy at\nGod's hand, by faith in Jesus Christ [John 16:8, Rom. 7:24, John\n16:9, Mark 16:16]).  This sight and sense of things worketh in him\nsorrow and shame for sin; he findeth, moreover, revealed in him the\nSaviour of the world, and the absolute necessity of closing with\nhim for life, at the which he findeth hungerings and thirstings\nafter him; to which hungerings, &c., the promise is made.  [Ps.\n38:18, Jer. 31:19, Gal. 2:16, Acts 4:12, Matt. 5:6, Rev. 21:6]\nNow, according to the strength or weakness of his faith in his\nSaviour, so is his joy and peace, so is his love to holiness, so\nare his desires to know him more, and also to serve him in this\nworld.  But though I say it discovereth itself thus unto him, yet\nit is but seldom that he is able to conclude that this is a work\nof grace; because his corruptions now, and his abused reason, make\nhis mind to misjudge in this matter; therefore, in him that hath\nthis work, there is required a very sound judgement before he can,\nwith steadiness, conclude that this is a work of grace.\n\n{202} To others, it is thus discovered:\n\n1.  By an experimental confession of his faith in Christ.  [Rom.\n10:10, Phil. 1:27, Matt. 5:19]\n\n2.  By a life answerable to that confession; to wit, a life of\nholiness, heart-holiness, family-holiness, (if he hath a family),\nand by conversation-holiness in the world which, in the general,\nteacheth him, inwardly, to abhor his sin, and himself for that, in\nsecret; to suppress it in his family and to promote holiness in\nthe world; not by talk only, as a hypocrite or talkative person may\ndo, but by a practical subjection, in faith and love, to the power\nof the Word.  [John 14:15, Ps. 50:23, Job 42:5-6, Eze. 20:43]\nAnd now, Sir, as to this brief description of the work of grace,\nand also the discovery of it, if you have aught to object, object;\nif not, then give me leave to propound to you a second question.\n\n{203} TALK. Nay, my part is not now to object, but to hear; let\nme, therefore, have your second question.\n\nFAITH. It is this:  Do you experience this first part of this\ndescription of it?  and doth your life and conversation testify the\nsame?  or standeth your religion in word or in tongue, and not in\ndeed and truth?  Pray, if you incline to answer me in this, say\nno more than you know the God above will say Amen to; and also\nnothing but what your conscience can justify you in; for not he\nthat commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.\nBesides, to say I am thus and thus, when my conversation, and all\nmy neighbours, tell me I lie, is great wickedness.\n\n{204} TALK. Then Talkative at first began to blush; but, recovering\nhimself, thus he replied:  You come now to experience, to conscience,\nand God; and to appeal to him for justification of what is spoken.\nThis kind of discourse I did not expect; nor am I disposed to\ngive an answer to such questions, because I count not myself bound\nthereto, unless you take upon you to be a catechiser, and, though\nyou should so do, yet I may refuse to make you my judge.  But, I\npray, will you tell me why you ask me such questions?\n\n{205} FAITH. Because I saw you forward to talk, and because I knew\nnot that you had aught else but notion.  Besides, to tell you all\nthe truth, I have heard of you, that you are a man whose religion\nlies in talk, and that your conversation gives this your mouth-profession\nthe lie.\n\nFaithful's plain dealing with Talkative\n\nThey say, you are a spot among Christians; and that religion fareth\nthe worse for your ungodly conversation; that some have already\nstumbled at your wicked ways, and that more are in danger of being\ndestroyed thereby; your religion, and an ale-house, and covetousness,\nand uncleanness, and swearing, and lying, and vain-company keeping,\n&c., will stand together.  The proverb is true of you which is\nsaid of a whore, to wit, that she is a shame to all women; so are\nyou a shame to all professors.\n\nTALK. Since you are ready to take up reports and to judge so rashly\nas you do, I cannot but conclude you are some peevish or melancholy\nman, not fit to be discoursed with; and so adieu.\n\n{206} CHR. Then came up Christian, and said to his brother, I told\nyou how it would happen:  your words and his lusts could not agree;\nhe had rather leave your company than reform his life.  But he is\ngone, as I said; let him go, the loss is no man's but his own; he\nhas saved us the trouble of going from him; for he continuing (as\nI suppose he will do) as he is, he would have been but a blot in our\ncompany:  besides, the apostle says, \"From such withdraw thyself.\"\n\nFAITH. But I am glad we had this little discourse with him; it\nmay happen that he will think of it again:  however, I have dealt\nplainly with him, and so am clear of his blood, if he perisheth.\n\n{207} CHR. You did well to talk so plainly to him as you did;\nthere is but little of this faithful dealing with men now-a-days,\nand that makes religion to stink so in the nostrils of many, as it\ndoth; for they are these talkative fools whose religion is only in\nword, and are debauched and vain in their conversation, that (being\nso much admitted into the fellowship of the godly) do puzzle the\nworld, blemish Christianity, and grieve the sincere.  I wish that\nall men would deal with such as you have done:  then should they\neither be made more conformable to religion, or the company of\nsaints would be too hot for them.  Then did Faithful say,\n\n\n  How Talkative at first lifts up his plumes!\n  How bravely doth he speak!  How he presumes\n  To drive down all before him!  But so soon\n  As Faithful talks of heart-work, like the moon\n  That's past the full, into the wane he goes.\n  And so will all, but he that HEART-WORK knows.\n\n\n{208} Thus they went on talking of what they had seen by the way,\nand so made that way easy which would otherwise, no doubt, have\nbeen tedious to them; for now they went through a wilderness.\n\n{209} Now, when they were got almost quite out of this wilderness,\nFaithful chanced to cast his eye back, and espied one coming after\nthem, and he knew him.  Oh!  said Faithful to his brother, who\ncomes yonder?  Then Christian looked, and said, It is my good friend\nEvangelist.  Ay, and my good friend too, said Faithful, for it was\nhe that set me in the way to the gate.  Now was Evangelist come up\nto them, and thus saluted them:\n\n{210} EVAN. Peace be with you, dearly beloved; and peace be to your\nhelpers.\n\nCHR. Welcome, welcome, my good Evangelist, the sight of\nthy countenance brings to my remembrance thy ancient kindness and\nunwearied labouring for my eternal good.\n\nFAITH. And a thousand times welcome, said good Faithful.  Thy\ncompany, O sweet Evangelist, how desirable it is to us poor pilgrims!\n\nEVAN. Then said Evangelist, How hath it fared with you, my friends,\nsince the time of our last parting?  What have you met with, and\nhow have you behaved yourselves?\n\n{211} Then Christian and Faithful told him of all things that had\nhappened to them in the way; and how, and with what difficulty,\nthey had arrived at that place.\n\n{212} EVAN. Right glad am I, said Evangelist, not that you have\nmet with trials, but that you have been victors; and for that you\nhave, notwithstanding many weaknesses, continued in the way to this\nvery day.\n\nI say, right glad am I of this thing, and that for mine own sake\nand yours.  I have sowed, and you have reaped:  and the day is\ncoming, when both he that sowed and they that reaped shall rejoice\ntogether; that is, if you hold out:  \"for in due season ye shall\nreap, if ye faint not.\"  [John 4:36, Gal. 6:9] The crown is before\nyou, and it is an incorruptible one; so run, that you may obtain\nit.  [1 Cor. 9:24-27] Some there be that set out for this crown,\nand, after they have gone far for it, another comes in, and takes\nit from them:  hold fast, therefore, that you have; let no man\ntake your crown.  [Rev. 3:11] You are not yet out of the gun-shot\nof the devil; you have not resisted unto blood, striving against\nsin; let the kingdom be always before you, and believe steadfastly\nconcerning things that are invisible.  Let nothing that is on this\nside the other world get within you; and, above all, look well to\nyour own hearts, and to the lusts thereof, \"for they are deceitful\nabove all things, and desperately wicked\"; set your faces like a\nflint; you have all power in heaven and earth on your side.\n\n{213} CHR. Then Christian thanked him for his exhortation; but\ntold him, withal, that they would have him speak further to them\nfor their help the rest of the way, and the rather, for that they\nwell knew that he was a prophet, and could tell them of things that\nmight happen unto them, and also how they might resist and overcome\nthem.  To which request Faithful also consented.  So Evangelist\nbegan as followeth:--\n\nEVAN. My sons, you have heard, in the words of the truth of\nthe gospel, that you must, through many tribulations, enter into\nthe kingdom of heaven.  And, again, that in every city bonds and\nafflictions abide in you; and therefore you cannot expect that you\nshould go long on your pilgrimage without them, in some sort or\nother.  You have found something of the truth of these testimonies\nupon you already, and more will immediately follow; for now, as\nyou see, you are almost out of this wilderness, and therefore you\nwill soon come into a town that you will by and by see before you;\nand in that town you will be hardly beset with enemies, who will\nstrain hard but they will kill you; and be you sure that one or\nboth of you must seal the testimony which you hold, with blood; but\nbe you faithful unto death, and the King will give you a crown of\nlife.\n\n{214} He that shall die there, although his death will be unnatural,\nand his pain perhaps great, he will yet have the better of his\nfellow; not only because he will be arrived at the Celestial City\nsoonest, but because he will escape many miseries that the other\nwill meet with in the rest of his journey.  But when you are come\nto the town, and shall find fulfilled what I have here related,\nthen remember your friend, and quit yourselves like men, and commit\nthe keeping of your souls to your God in well-doing, as unto a\nfaithful Creator.\n\n{215} Then I saw in my dream, that when they were got out of the\nwilderness, they presently saw a town before them, and the name of\nthat town is Vanity; and at the town there is a fair kept, called\nVanity Fair:  it is kept all the year long.  It beareth the name\nof Vanity Fair because the town where it is kept is lighter than\nvanity; and, also because all that is there sold, or that cometh\nthither, is vanity.  As is the saying of the wise, \"all that cometh\nis vanity.\"  [Eccl. 1; 2:11,17; 11:8; Isa. 11:17]\n\n{216} This fair is no new-erected business, but a thing of ancient\nstanding; I will show you the original of it.\n\nAlmost five thousand years agone, there were pilgrims walking to\nthe Celestial City, as these two honest persons are:  and Beelzebub,\nApollyon, and Legion, with their companions, perceiving by the\npath that the pilgrims made, that their way to the city lay through\nthis town of Vanity, they contrived here to set up a fair; a fair\nwherein, should be sold all sorts of vanity, and that it should last\nall the year long:  therefore at this fair are all such merchandise\nsold, as houses, lands, trades, places, honours, preferments, titles,\ncountries, kingdoms, lusts, pleasures, and delights of all sorts,\nas whores, bawds, wives, husbands, children, masters, servants,\nlives, blood, bodies, souls, silver, gold, pearls, precious stones,\nand what not.\n\nAnd, moreover, at this fair there is at all times to be seen juggling\ncheats, games, plays, fools, apes, knaves, and rogues, and that of\nevery kind.\n\nHere are to be seen, too, and that for nothing, thefts, murders,\nadulteries, false swearers, and that of a blood-red colour.\n\n{217} And as in other fairs of less moment, there are the several\nrows and streets, under their proper names, where such and such\nwares are vended; so here likewise you have the proper places,\nrows, streets, (viz.  countries and kingdoms), where the wares of\nthis fair are soonest to be found.  Here is the Britain Row, the\nFrench Row, the Italian Row, the Spanish Row, the German Row, where\nseveral sorts of vanities are to be sold.  But, as in other fairs,\nsome one commodity is as the chief of all the fair, so the ware\nof Rome and her merchandise is greatly promoted in this fair; only\nour English nation, with some others, have taken a dislike thereat.\n\n{218} Now, as I said, the way to the Celestial City lies just\nthrough this town where this lusty fair is kept; and he that will\ngo to the city, and yet not go through this town, must needs go out\nof the world.  [1 Cor. 5:10] The Prince of princes himself, when\nhere, went through this town to his own country, and that upon a\nfair day too; yea, and as I think, it was Beelzebub, the chief lord\nof this fair, that invited him to buy of his vanities; yea, would\nhave made him lord of the fair, would he but have done him reverence\nas he went through the town.  [Matt. 4:8, Luke 4:5-7] Yea, because\nhe was such a person of honour, Beelzebub had him from street to\nstreet, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a little\ntime, that he might, if possible, allure the Blessed One to cheapen\nand buy some of his vanities; but he had no mind to the merchandise,\nand therefore left the town, without laying out so much as one\nfarthing upon these vanities.  This fair, therefore, is an ancient\nthing, of long standing, and a very great fair.\n\n{219} Now these pilgrims, as I said, must needs go through this\nfair.  Well, so they did:  but, behold, even as they entered into\nthe fair, all the people in the fair were moved, and the town\nitself as it were in a hubbub about them; and that for several\nreasons:  for--\n\n{220} First, The pilgrims were clothed with such kind of raiment\nas was diverse from the raiment of any that traded in that fair.\nThe people, therefore, of the fair, made a great gazing upon them:\nsome said they were fools, some they were bedlams, and some they\nare outlandish men.  [1 Cor. 2:7-8]\n\n{221} Secondly, And as they wondered at their apparel, so they did\nlikewise at their speech; for few could understand what they said;\nthey naturally spoke the language of Canaan, but they that kept\nthe fair were the men of this world; so that, from one end of the\nfair to the other, they seemed barbarians each to the other.\n\n{222} Thirdly, But that which did not a little amuse the merchandisers\nwas, that these pilgrims set very light by all their wares; they\ncared not so much as to look upon them; and if they called upon them\nto buy, they would put their fingers in their ears, and cry, Turn\naway mine eyes from beholding vanity, and look upwards, signifying\nthat their trade and traffic was in heaven.  [Ps. 119:37, Phil.\n3:19-20]\n\n{223} One chanced mockingly, beholding the carriage of the men, to\nsay unto them, What will ye buy?  But they, looking gravely upon\nhim, answered, \"We buy the truth.\"  [Prov. 23:23] At that there\nwas an occasion taken to despise the men the more; some mocking,\nsome taunting, some speaking reproachfully, and some calling upon\nothers to smite them.  At last things came to a hubbub and great\nstir in the fair, insomuch that all order was confounded.  Now was\nword presently brought to the great one of the fair, who quickly\ncame down, and deputed some of his most trusty friends to take these\nmen into examination, about whom the fair was almost overturned.  So\nthe men were brought to examination; and they that sat upon them,\nasked them whence they came, whither they went, and what they did\nthere, in such an unusual garb?  The men told them that they were\npilgrims and strangers in the world, and that they were going to\ntheir own country, which was the heavenly Jerusalem, [Heb. 11:13-16]\nand that they had given no occasion to the men of the town, nor\nyet to the merchandisers, thus to abuse them, and to let them in\ntheir journey, except it was for that, when one asked them what\nthey would buy, they said they would buy the truth.  But they that\nwere appointed to examine them did not believe them to be any other\nthan bedlams and mad, or else such as came to put all things into\na confusion in the fair.  Therefore they took them and beat them,\nand besmeared them with dirt, and then put them into the cage, that\nthey might be made a spectacle to all the men of the fair.\n\n\n  Behold Vanity Fair!  the Pilgrims there\n  Are chain'd and stand beside:\n  Even so it was our Lord pass'd here,\n  And on Mount Calvary died.\n\n\n{224} There, therefore, they lay for some time, and were made the\nobjects of any man's sport, or malice, or revenge, the great one of\nthe fair laughing still at all that befell them.  But the men being\npatient, and not rendering railing for railing, but contrariwise,\nblessing, and good words for bad, and kindness for injuries done,\nsome men in the fair that were more observing, and less prejudiced\nthan the rest, began to check and blame the baser sort for their\ncontinual abuses done by them to the men; they, therefore, in\nangry manner, let fly at them again, counting them as bad as the\nmen in the cage, and telling them that they seemed confederates, and\nshould be made partakers of their misfortunes.  The other replied\nthat, for aught they could see, the men were quiet, and sober, and\nintended nobody any harm; and that there were many that traded in\ntheir fair that were more worthy to be put into the cage, yea, and\npillory too, than were the men they had abused.  Thus, after divers\nwords had passed on both sides, the men behaving themselves all\nthe while very wisely and soberly before them, they fell to some\nblows among themselves, and did harm one to another.  Then were\nthese two poor men brought before their examiners again, and there\ncharged as being guilty of the late hubbub that had been in the\nfair.  So they beat them pitifully, and hanged irons upon them,\nand led them in chains up and down the fair, for an example and a\nterror to others, lest any should speak in their behalf, or join\nthemselves unto them.  But Christian and Faithful behaved themselves\nyet more wisely, and received the ignominy and shame that was\ncast upon them, with so much meekness and patience, that it won to\ntheir side, though but few in comparison of the rest, several of\nthe men in the fair.  This put the other party yet into greater\nrage, insomuch that they concluded the death of these two men.\nWherefore they threatened, that the cage nor irons should serve\ntheir turn, but that they should die, for the abuse they had done,\nand for deluding the men of the fair.\n\nThen were they remanded to the cage again, until further order\nshould be taken with them.  So they put them in, and made their\nfeet fast in the stocks.\n\n{225} Here, therefore, they called again to mind what they had heard\nfrom their faithful friend Evangelist, and were the more confirmed\nin their way and sufferings by what he told them would happen to\nthem.  They also now comforted each other, that whose lot it was\nto suffer, even he should have the best of it; therefore each man\nsecretly wished that he might have that preferment:  but committing\nthemselves to the all-wise disposal of Him that ruleth all things,\nwith much content, they abode in the condition in which they were,\nuntil they should be otherwise disposed of.\n\n{226} Then a convenient time being appointed, they brought them\nforth to their trial, in order to their condemnation.  When the\ntime was come, they were brought before their enemies and arraigned.\nThe judge's name was Lord Hate-good.  Their indictment was one and\nthe same in substance, though somewhat varying in form, the contents\nwhereof were this:--\n\n{227} \"That they were enemies to and disturbers of their trade;\nthat they had made commotions and divisions in the town, and had\nwon a party to their own most dangerous opinions, in contempt of\nthe law of their prince.\"\n\n\n  Now, FAITHFUL, play the man, speak for thy God:\n  Fear not the wicked's malice; nor their rod:\n  Speak boldly, man, the truth is on thy side:\n  Die for it, and to life in triumph ride.\n\n\n{228} Faithful's answer for himself\n\nThen Faithful began to answer, that he had only set himself against\nthat which hath set itself against Him that is higher than the\nhighest.  And, said he, as for disturbance, I make none, being\nmyself a man of peace; the parties that were won to us, were won\nby beholding our truth and innocence, and they are only turned from\nthe worse to the better.  And as to the king you talk of, since he\nis Beelzebub, the enemy of our Lord, I defy him and all his angels.\n\n{229} Then proclamation was made, that they that had aught to say\nfor their lord the king against the prisoner at the bar, should\nforthwith appear and give in their evidence.  So there came in\nthree witnesses, to wit, Envy, Superstition, and Pickthank.  They\nwere then asked if they knew the prisoner at the bar; and what they\nhad to say for their lord the king against him.\n\n{230} Then stood forth Envy, and said to this effect:  My Lord, I\nhave known this man a long time, and will attest upon my oath before\nthis honourable bench, that he is--\n\nJUDGE. Hold!  Give him his oath.  (So they sware him.) Then he said--\n\nENVY. My Lord, this man, notwithstanding his plausible name, is\none of the vilest men in our country.  He neither regardeth prince\nnor people, law nor custom; but doth all that he can to possess all\nmen with certain of his disloyal notions, which he in the general\ncalls principles of faith and holiness.  And, in particular, I\nheard him once myself affirm that Christianity and the customs of\nour town of Vanity were diametrically opposite, and could not be\nreconciled.  By which saying, my Lord, he doth at once not only\ncondemn all our laudable doings, but us in the doing of them.\n\nJUDGE. Then did the Judge say to him, Hast thou any more to say?\n\nENVY. My Lord, I could say much more, only I would not be tedious\nto the court.  Yet, if need be, when the other gentlemen have given\nin their evidence, rather than anything shall be wanting that will\ndespatch him, I will enlarge my testimony against him.  So he was\nbid to stand by.  Then they called Superstition, and bid him look\nupon the prisoner.  They also asked, what he could say for their\nlord the king against him.  Then they sware him; so he began.\n\n{231} SUPER. My Lord, I have no great acquaintance with this man,\nnor do I desire to have further knowledge of him; however, this I\nknow, that he is a very pestilent fellow, from some discourse that,\nthe other day, I had with him in this town; for then, talking with\nhim, I heard him say, that our religion was naught, and such by\nwhich a man could by no means please God.  Which sayings of his, my\nLord, your Lordship very well knows, what necessarily thence will\nfollow, to wit, that we do still worship in vain, are yet in our\nsins, and finally shall be damned; and this is that which I have\nto say.\n\n{232} Then was Pickthank sworn, and bid say what he knew, in behalf\nof their lord the king, against the prisoner at the bar.\n\nPickthank's testimony\n\nPICK. My Lord, and you gentlemen all, This fellow I have known of a\nlong time, and have heard him speak things that ought not to be spoke;\nfor he hath railed on our noble prince Beelzebub, and hath spoken\ncontemptibly of his honourable friends, whose names are the Lord Old\nMan, the Lord Carnal Delight, the Lord Luxurious, the Lord Desire\nof Vain Glory, my old Lord Lechery, Sir Having Greedy, with all\nthe rest of our nobility; and he hath said, moreover, That if all\nmen were of his mind, if possible, there is not one of these noblemen\nshould have any longer a being in this town.  Besides, he hath not\nbeen afraid to rail on you, my Lord, who are now appointed to be\nhis judge, calling you an ungodly villain, with many other such\nlike vilifying terms, with which he hath bespattered most of the\ngentry of our town.\n\n{233} When this Pickthank had told his tale, the Judge directed his\nspeech to the prisoner at the bar, saying, Thou runagate, heretic,\nand traitor, hast thou heard what these honest gentlemen have\nwitnessed against thee?\n\nFAITH. May I speak a few words in my own defence?\n\nJUDGE. Sirrah!  sirrah!  thou deservest to live no longer, but to\nbe slain immediately upon the place; yet, that all men may see our\ngentleness towards thee, let us hear what thou, vile runagate, hast\nto say.\n\n{234} Faithful's defence of himself\n\nFAITH. 1.  I say, then, in answer to what Mr. Envy hath spoken,\nI never said aught but this, That what rule, or laws, or customs,\nor people, were flat against the Word of God, are diametrically\nopposite to Christianity.  If I have said amiss in this, convince\nme of my error, and I am ready here before you to make my recantation.\n\n{235} 2.  As to the second, to wit, Mr. Superstition, and his charge\nagainst me, I said only this, That in the worship of God there is\nrequired a Divine faith; but there can be no Divine faith without\na Divine revelation of the will of God.  Therefore, whatever\nis thrust into the worship of God that is not agreeable to Divine\nrevelation, cannot be done but by a human faith, which faith will\nnot be profitable to eternal life.\n\n{236} 3.  As to what Mr. Pickthank hath said, I say (avoiding terms,\nas that I am said to rail, and the like) that the prince of this\ntown, with all the rabblement, his attendants, by this gentleman\nnamed, are more fit for a being in hell, than in this town and\ncountry:  and so, the Lord have mercy upon me!\n\n{237} Then the Judge called to the jury (who all this while stood\nby, to hear and observe):  Gentlemen of the jury, you see this man\nabout whom so great an uproar hath been made in this town.  You\nhave also heard what these worthy gentlemen have witnessed against\nhim.  Also you have heard his reply and confession.  It lieth now\nin your breasts to hang him or save his life; but yet I think meet\nto instruct you into our law.\n\n{238} There was an Act made in the days of Pharaoh the Great,\nservant to our prince, that lest those of a contrary religion should\nmultiply and grow too strong for him, their males should be thrown\ninto the river.  [Exo. 1:22] There was also an Act made in the\ndays of Nebuchadnezzar the Great, another of his servants, that\nwhosoever would not fall down and worship his golden image, should\nbe thrown into a fiery furnace.  [Dan. 3:6] There was also an Act\nmade in the days of Darius, that whoso, for some time, called upon\nany god but him, should be cast into the lions' den.  [Dan. 6]\nNow the substance of these laws this rebel has broken, not only\nin thought, (which is not to be borne), but also in word and deed;\nwhich must therefore needs be intolerable.\n\n{239} For that of Pharaoh, his law was made upon a supposition, to\nprevent mischief, no crime being yet apparent; but here is a crime\napparent.  For the second and third, you see he disputeth against\nour religion; and for the treason he hath confessed, he deserveth\nto die the death.\n\n{240} Then went the jury out, whose names were, Mr. Blind-man, Mr.\nNo-good, Mr. Malice, Mr. Love-lust, Mr. Live-loose, Mr. Heady, Mr.\nHigh-mind, Mr. Enmity, Mr. Liar, Mr. Cruelty, Mr. Hate-light, and\nMr. Implacable; who every one gave in his private verdict against\nhim among themselves, and afterwards unanimously concluded to bring\nhim in guilty before the Judge.  And first, among themselves, Mr.\nBlind-man, the foreman, said, I see clearly that this man is a\nheretic.  Then said Mr. No-good, Away with such a fellow from the\nearth.  Ay, said Mr. Malice, for I hate the very looks of him.\nThen said Mr. Love-lust, I could never endure him.  Nor I, said Mr.\nLive-loose, for he would always be condemning my way.  Hang him,\nhang him, said Mr. Heady.  A sorry scrub, said Mr. High-mind.  My\nheart riseth against him, said Mr. Enmity.  He is a rogue, said\nMr. Liar.  Hanging is too good for him, said Mr. Cruelty.  Let us\ndespatch him out of the way, said Mr. Hate-light.  Then said Mr.\nImplacable, Might I have all the world given me, I could not be\nreconciled to him; therefore, let us forthwith bring him in guilty\nof death.  And so they did; therefore he was presently condemned\nto be had from the place where he was, to the place from whence\nhe came, and there to be put to the most cruel death that could be\ninvented.\n\n{241} They therefore brought him out, to do with him according to\ntheir law; and, first, they scourged him, then they buffeted him,\nthen they lanced his flesh with knives; after that, they stoned\nhim with stones, then pricked him with their swords; and, last of\nall, they burned him to ashes at the stake.  Thus came Faithful to\nhis end.\n\n{242} Now I saw that there stood behind the multitude a chariot\nand a couple of horses, waiting for Faithful, who (so soon as his\nadversaries had despatched him) was taken up into it, and straightway\nwas carried up through the clouds, with sound of trumpet, the\nnearest way to the Celestial Gate.\n\n\n  Brave FAITHFUL, bravely done in word and deed;\n  Judge, witnesses, and jury have, instead\n  Of overcoming thee, but shown their rage:\n  When they are dead, thou'lt live from age to age*.\n\n*In the New Heaven and New Earth.  {footnote from one edition}\n\n\n{243} But as for Christian, he had some respite, and was remanded\nback to prison.  So he there remained for a space; but He that\noverrules all things, having the power of their rage in his own\nhand, so wrought it about, that Christian for that time escaped\nthem, and went his way.  And as he went, he sang, saying--\n\n  Well, Faithful, thou hast faithfully profest\n  Unto thy Lord; with whom thou shalt be blest,\n  When faithless ones, with all their vain delights,\n  Are crying out under their hellish plights:\n  Sing, Faithful, sing, and let thy name survive;\n  For though they kill'd thee, thou art yet alive!\n\n\n{244} Now I saw in my dream, that Christian went not forth alone,\nfor there was one whose name was Hopeful (being made so by the\nbeholding of Christian and Faithful in their words and behaviour,\nin their sufferings at the fair), who joined himself unto him, and,\nentering into a brotherly covenant, told him that he would be his\ncompanion.  Thus, one died to bear testimony to the truth, and\nanother rises out of his ashes, to be a companion with Christian\nin his pilgrimage.  This Hopeful also told Christian, that there\nwere many more of the men in the fair, that would take their time\nand follow after.\n\n{245} So I saw that quickly after they were got out of the fair,\nthey overtook one that was going before them, whose name was By-ends:\nso they said to him, What countryman, Sir?  and how far go you this\nway?  He told them that he came from the town of Fair-speech, and\nhe was going to the Celestial City (but told them not his name).\n\nFrom Fair-speech!  said Christian.  Is there any good that lives\nthere?  [Prov. 26:25]\n\nBY-ENDS. Yes, said By-ends, I hope.\n\nCHR. Pray, Sir, what may I call you?  said Christian.\n\nBY-ENDS. I am a stranger to you, and you to me:  if you be going\nthis way, I shall be glad of your company; if not, I must be content.\n\nCHR. This town of Fair-speech, said Christian, I have heard of;\nand, as I remember, they say it is a wealthy place.\n\nBY-ENDS. Yes, I will assure you that it is; and I have very many\nrich kindred there.\n\n{246} CHR. Pray, who are your kindred there?  if a man may be so\nbold.\n\nBY-ENDS. Almost the whole town; and in particular, my Lord\nTurn-about, my Lord Time-server, my Lord Fair-speech, (from whose\nancestors that town first took its name), also Mr. Smooth-man, Mr.\nFacing-both-ways, Mr. Any-thing; and the parson of our parish, Mr.\nTwo-tongues, was my mother's own brother by father's side; and to\ntell you the truth, I am become a gentleman of good quality, yet\nmy great-grandfather was but a waterman, looking one way and rowing\nanother, and I got most of my estate by the same occupation.\n\nCHR. Are you a married man?\n\nBY-ENDS. Yes, and my wife is a very virtuous woman, the daughter\nof a virtuous woman; she was my Lady Feigning's daughter, therefore\nshe came of a very honourable family, and is arrived to such a\npitch of breeding, that she knows how to carry it to all, even to\nprince and peasant.  It is true we somewhat differ in religion from\nthose of the stricter sort, yet but in two small points:  first,\nwe never strive against wind and tide; secondly, we are always most\nzealous when religion goes in his silver slippers; we love much\nto walk with him in the street, if the sun shines, and the people\napplaud him.\n\n{247} Then Christian stepped a little aside to his fellow, Hopeful,\nsaying, It runs in my mind that this is one By-ends of Fair-speech;\nand if it be he, we have as very a knave in our company as dwelleth\nin all these parts.  Then said Hopeful, Ask him; methinks he should\nnot be ashamed of his name.  So Christian came up with him again,\nand said, Sir, you talk as if you knew something more than all the\nworld doth; and if I take not my mark amiss, I deem I have half a\nguess of you:  Is not your name Mr. By-ends, of Fair-speech?\n\nBY-ENDS. This is not my name, but indeed it is a nick-name that is\ngiven me by some that cannot abide me:  and I must be content to\nbear it as a reproach, as other good men have borne theirs before\nme.\n\n{247} CHR. But did you never give an occasion to men to call you\nby this name?\n\nBY-ENDS. Never, never!  The worst that ever I did to give them an\noccasion to give me this name was, that I had always the luck to\njump in my judgment with the present way of the times, whatever it\nwas, and my chance was to get thereby; but if things are thus cast\nupon me, let me count them, a blessing; but let not the malicious\nload me therefore with reproach.\n\n{248} CHR. I thought, indeed, that you were the man that I heard\nof; and to tell you what I think, I fear this name belongs to you\nmore properly than you are willing we should think it doth.\n\nBY-ENDS. Well, if you will thus imagine, I cannot help it; you\nshall find me a fair company-keeper, if you will still admit me\nyour associate.\n\nCHR. If you will go with us, you must go against wind and tide;\nthe which, I perceive, is against your opinion; you must also own\nreligion in his rags, as well as when in his silver slippers; and\nstand by him, too, when bound in irons, as well as when he walketh\nthe streets with applause.\n\nBY-ENDS. You must not impose, nor lord it over my faith; leave me\nto my liberty, and let me go with you.\n\nCHR. Not a step further, unless you will do in what I propound as\nwe.\n\nThen said By-ends, I shall never desert my old principles, since\nthey are harmless and profitable.  If I may not go with you, I must\ndo as I did before you overtook me, even go by myself, until some\novertake me that will be glad of my company.\n\n{249} Now I saw in my dream that Christian and Hopeful forsook him,\nand kept their distance before him; but one of them looking back,\nsaw three men following Mr. By-ends, and behold, as they came up\nwith him, he made them a very low conge {conge'}; and they also\ngave him a compliment.  The men's names were Mr. Hold-the-world,\nMr. Money-love, and Mr. Save-all; men that Mr. By-ends had formerly\nbeen acquainted with; for in their minority they were schoolfellows,\nand were taught by one Mr. Gripe-man, a schoolmaster in Love-gain,\nwhich is a market town in the county of Coveting, in the north.  This\nschoolmaster taught them the art of getting, either by violence,\ncozenage, flattery, lying, or by putting on the guise of religion;\nand these four gentlemen had attained much of the art of their\nmaster, so that they could each of them have kept such a school\nthemselves.\n\n{250} Well, when they had, as I said, thus saluted each other, Mr.\nMoney-love said to Mr. By-ends, Who are they upon the road before\nus?  (for Christian and Hopeful were yet within view).\n\nBy-ends' character of the pilgrims\n\nBY-ENDS. They are a couple of far countrymen, that, after their\nmode, are going on pilgrimage.\n\nMONEY-LOVE. Alas!  Why did they not stay, that we might have had\ntheir good company?  for they, and we, and you, Sir, I hope, are\nall going on pilgrimage.\n\nBY-ENDS. We are so, indeed; but the men before us are so rigid,\nand love so much their own notions, and do also so lightly esteem\nthe opinions of others, that let a man be never so godly, yet if\nhe jumps not with them in all things, they thrust him quite out of\ntheir company.\n\n{251} SAVE-ALL. That is bad, but we read of some that are righteous\novermuch; and such men's rigidness prevails with them to judge and\ncondemn all but themselves.  But, I pray, what, and how many, were\nthe things wherein you differed?\n\nBY-ENDS. Why, they, after their headstrong manner, conclude that\nit is duty to rush on their journey all weathers; and I am for\nwaiting for wind and tide.  They are for hazarding all for God at\na clap; and I am for taking all advantages to secure my life and\nestate.  They are for holding their notions, though all other men\nare against them; but I am for religion in what, and so far as the\ntimes, and my safety, will bear it.  They are for religion when\nin rags and contempt; but I am for him when he walks in his golden\nslippers, in the sunshine, and with applause.\n\n{252} HOLD-THE-WORLD. Ay, and hold you there still, good Mr.\nBy-ends; for, for my part, I can count him but a fool, that, having\nthe liberty to keep what he has, shall be so unwise as to lose it.\nLet us be wise as serpents; it is best to make hay when the sun\nshines; you see how the bee lieth still all winter, and bestirs her\nonly when she can have profit with pleasure.  God sends sometimes\nrain, and sometimes sunshine; if they be such fools to go through\nthe first, yet let us be content to take fair weather along with\nus.  For my part, I like that religion best that will stand with\nthe security of God's good blessings unto us; for who can imagine,\nthat is ruled by his reason, since God has bestowed upon us the\ngood things of this life, but that he would have us keep them for\nhis sake?  Abraham and Solomon grew rich in religion.  And Job\nsays, that a good man shall lay up gold as dust.  But he must not\nbe such as the men before us, if they be as you have described\nthem.\n\nSAVE-ALL. I think that we are all agreed in this matter, and\ntherefore there needs no more words about it.\n\nMONEY-LOVE. No, there needs no more words about this matter, indeed;\nfor he that believes neither Scripture nor reason (and you see we\nhave both on our side) neither knows his own liberty, nor seeks\nhis own safety.\n\n{253} BY-ENDS. My brethren, we are, as you see, going all on\npilgrimage; and, for our better diversion from things that are bad,\ngive me leave to propound unto you this question:--\n\nSuppose a man, a minister, or a tradesman, &c., should have an\nadvantage lie before him, to get the good blessings of this life,\nyet so as that he can by no means come by them except, in appearance\nat least, he becomes extraordinarily zealous in some points\nof religion that he meddled not with before, may he not use these\nmeans to attain his end, and yet be a right honest man?\n\n{254} MONEY-LOVE. I see the bottom of your question; and, with these\ngentlemen's good leave, I will endeavour to shape you an answer.\nAnd first, to speak to your question as it concerns a minister\nhimself:  Suppose a minister, a worthy man, possessed but of a very\nsmall benefice, and has in his eye a greater, more fat, and plump\nby far; he has also now an opportunity of getting of it, yet so as\nby being more studious, by preaching more frequently and zealously,\nand, because the temper of the people requires it, by altering\nof some of his principles; for my part, I see no reason but a man\nmay do this, (provided he has a call), ay, and more a great deal\nbesides, and yet be an honest man.  For why--\n\n{255} 1.  His desire of a greater benefice is lawful, (this cannot\nbe contradicted), since it is set before him by Providence; so then,\nhe may get it, if he can, making no question for conscience' sake.\n\n{256} 2.  Besides, his desire after that benefice makes him more\nstudious, a more zealous preacher, &c., and so makes him a better\nman; yea, makes him better improve his parts, which is according\nto the mind of God.\n\n{257} 3.  Now, as for his complying with the temper of his people,\nby dissenting, to serve them, some of his principles, this argueth,\n(1) That he is of a self-denying, temper; (2) Of a sweet and winning\ndeportment; and so (3) more fit for the ministerial function.\n\n{258} 4.  I conclude, then, that a minister that changes a small\nfor a great, should not, for so doing, be judged as covetous; but\nrather, since he has improved in his parts and industry thereby,\nbe counted as one that pursues his call, and the opportunity put\ninto his hands to do good.\n\n{259} And now to the second part of the question, which concerns\nthe tradesman you mentioned.  Suppose such a one to have but a poor\nemploy in the world, but by becoming religious, he may mend his\nmarket, perhaps get a rich wife, or more and far better customers\nto his shop; for my part, I see no reason but that this may be\nlawfully done.  For why--\n\n1.  To become religious is a virtue, by what means soever a man\nbecomes so.\n\n2.  Nor is it unlawful to get a rich wife, or more custom to my\nshop.\n\n3.  Besides, the man that gets these by becoming religious, gets\nthat which is good, of them that are good, by becoming good himself;\nso then here is a good wife, and good customers, and good gain,\nand all these by becoming religious, which is good; therefore, to\nbecome religious, to get all these, is a good and profitable design.\n\n{260} This answer, thus made by this Mr. Money-love to Mr. By-ends's\nquestion, was highly applauded by them all; wherefore they concluded\nupon the whole, that it was most wholesome and advantageous.  And\nbecause, as they thought, no man was able to contradict it, and\nbecause Christian and Hopeful were yet within call, they jointly\nagreed to assault them with the question as soon as they overtook\nthem; and the rather because they had opposed Mr. By-ends before.\nSo they called after them, and they stopped, and stood still till\nthey came up to them; but they concluded, as they went, that not Mr.\nBy-ends, but old Mr. Hold-the-world, should propound the question\nto them, because, as they supposed, their answer to him would be\nwithout the remainder of that heat that was kindled betwixt Mr.\nBy-ends and them, at their parting a little before.\n\n{260} So they came up to each other, and after a short salutation,\nMr. Hold-the-world propounded the question to Christian and his\nfellow, and bid them to answer it if they could.\n\nCHR. Then said Christian, Even a babe in religion may answer ten\nthousand such questions.  For if it be unlawful to follow Christ for\nloaves, (as it is in the sixth of John), how much more abominable\nis it to make of him and religion a stalking-horse to get and enjoy\nthe world!  Nor do we find any other than heathens, hypocrites,\ndevils, and witches, that are of this opinion.\n\n{261} 1.  Heathens; for when Hamor and Shechem had a mind to the\ndaughter and cattle of Jacob, and saw that there was no way for them\nto come at them, but by becoming circumcised, they say to their\ncompanions, If every male of us be circumcised, as they are circumcised,\nshall not their cattle, and their substance, and every beast of\ntheirs, be ours?  Their daughter and their cattle were that which\nthey sought to obtain, and their religion the stalking-horse they\nmade use of to come at them.  Read the whole story.  [Gen. 34:20-23]\n\n{262} 2.  The hypocritical Pharisees were also of this religion;\nlong prayers were their pretence, but to get widows' houses was\ntheir intent; and greater damnation was from God their judgment.\n[Luke 20:46-47]\n\n{263} 3.  Judas the devil was also of this religion; he was religious\nfor the bag, that he might be possessed of what was therein; but\nhe was lost, cast away, and the very son of perdition.\n\n{264} 4.  Simon the witch was of this religion too; for he would\nhave had the Holy Ghost, that he might have got money therewith;\nand his sentence from Peter's mouth was according.  [Acts 8:19-22]\n\n{265} 5.  Neither will it out of my mind, but that that man that\ntakes up religion for the world, will throw away religion for\nthe world; for so surely as Judas resigned the world in becoming\nreligious, so surely did he also sell religion and his Master for\nthe same.  To answer the question, therefore, affirmatively, as I\nperceive you have done, and to accept of, as authentic, such answer,\nis both heathenish, hypocritical, and devilish; and your reward\nwill be according to your works.  Then they stood staring one upon\nanother, but had not wherewith to answer Christian.  Hopeful also\napproved of the soundness of Christian's answer; so there was a great\nsilence among them.  Mr. By-ends and his company also staggered\nand kept behind, that Christian and Hopeful might outgo them.  Then\nsaid Christian to his fellow, If these men cannot stand before the\nsentence of men, what will they do with the sentence of God?  And\nif they are mute when dealt with by vessels of clay, what will they\ndo when they shall be rebuked by the flames of a devouring fire?\n\n{266} Then Christian and Hopeful outwent them again, and went till\nthey came to a delicate plain called Ease, where they went with\nmuch content; but that plain was but narrow, so they were quickly\ngot over it.  Now at the further side of that plain was a little\nhill called Lucre, and in that hill a silver mine, which some of\nthem that had formerly gone that way, because of the rarity of it,\nhad turned aside to see; but going too near the brink of the pit,\nthe ground being deceitful under them, broke, and they were slain;\nsome also had been maimed there, and could not, to their dying day,\nbe their own men again.\n\n{267} Then I saw in my dream, that a little off the road, over\nagainst the silver mine, stood Demas (gentlemanlike) to call to\npassengers to come and see; who said to Christian and his fellow,\nHo!  turn aside hither, and I will show you a thing.\n\nCHR. What thing so deserving as to turn us out of the way to see\nit?\n\nDEMAS. Here is a silver mine, and some digging in it for treasure.\nIf you will come, with a little pains you may richly provide for\nyourselves.\n\n{268} HOPE. Then said Hopeful, Let us go see.\n\nCHR. Not I, said Christian, I have heard of this place before now;\nand how many have there been slain; and besides that, treasure\nis a snare to those that seek it; for it hindereth them in their\npilgrimage.  Then Christian called to Demas, saying, Is not the\nplace dangerous?  Hath it not hindered many in their pilgrimage?\n[Hos. 14:8]\n\nDEMAS. Not very dangerous, except to those that are careless, (but\nwithal, he blushed as he spake).\n\nCHR. Then said Christian to Hopeful, Let us not stir a step, but\nstill keep on our way.\n\nHOPE. I will warrant you, when By-ends comes up, if he hath the\nsame invitation as we, he will turn in thither to see.\n\nCHR. No doubt thereof, for his principles lead him that way, and\na hundred to one but he dies there.\n\nDEMAS. Then Demas called again, saying, But will you not come over\nand see?\n\n{269} CHR. Then Christian roundly answered, saying, Demas, thou\nart an enemy to the right ways of the Lord of this way, and hast\nbeen already condemned for thine own turning aside, by one of His\nMajesty's judges [2 Tim. 4:10]; and why seekest thou to bring us\ninto the like condemnation?  Besides, if we at all turn aside, our\nLord and King will certainly hear thereof, and will there put us\nto shame, where we would stand with boldness before him.\n\nDemas cried again, that he also was one of their fraternity; and\nthat if they would tarry a little, he also himself would walk with\nthem.\n\n{270} CHR. Then said Christian, What is thy name?  Is it not the\nsame by the which I have called thee?\n\nDEMAS. Yes, my name is Demas; I am the son of Abraham.\n\nCHR. I know you; Gehazi was your great-grandfather, and Judas your\nfather; and you have trod in their steps. [2 Kings 5:20, Matt.\n26:14,15, 27:1-5] It is but a devilish prank that thou usest;\nthy father was hanged for a traitor, and thou deservest no better\nreward.  Assure thyself, that when we come to the King, we will do\nhim word of this thy behaviour.  Thus they went their way.\n\n{271} By this time By-ends and his companions were come again\nwithin sight, and they, at the first beck, went over to Demas.  Now,\nwhether they fell into the pit by looking over the brink thereof,\nor whether they went down to dig, or whether they were smothered in\nthe bottom by the damps that commonly arise, of these things I am\nnot certain; but this I observed, that they never were seen again\nin the way.  Then sang Christian--\n\n  By-ends and silver Demas both agree;\n  One calls, the other runs, that he may be\n  A sharer in his lucre; so these do\n  Take up in this world, and no further go.\n\n\n{272} Now I saw that, just on the other side of this plain,\nthe pilgrims came to a place where stood an old monument, hard by\nthe highway side, at the sight of which they were both concerned,\nbecause of the strangeness of the form thereof; for it seemed\nto them as if it had been a woman transformed into the shape of a\npillar; here, therefore they stood looking, and looking upon it,\nbut could not for a time tell what they should make thereof.  At\nlast Hopeful espied written above the head thereof, a writing in\nan unusual hand; but he being no scholar, called to Christian (for\nhe was learned) to see if he could pick out the meaning; so he came,\nand after a little laying of letters together, he found the same\nto be this, \"Remember Lot's Wife\".  So he read it to his fellow;\nafter which they both concluded that that was the pillar of salt into\nwhich Lot's wife was turned, for her looking back with a covetous\nheart, when she was going from Sodom for safety.  [Gen. 19:26]\nWhich sudden and amazing sight gave them occasion of this discourse.\n\n{273} CHR. Ah, my brother!  this is a seasonable sight; it came\nopportunely to us after the invitation which Demas gave us to come\nover to view the Hill Lucre; and had we gone over, as he desired\nus, and as thou wast inclining to do, my brother, we had, for aught\nI know, been made ourselves like this woman, a spectacle for those\nthat shall come after to behold.\n\nHOPE. I am sorry that I was so foolish, and am made to wonder that\nI am not now as Lot's wife; for wherein was the difference betwixt\nher sin and mine?  She only looked back; and I had a desire to go\nsee.  Let grace be adored, and let me be ashamed that ever such a\nthing should be in mine heart.\n\n{274} CHR. Let us take notice of what we see here, for our help\nfor time to come.  This woman escaped one judgment, for she fell\nnot by the destruction of Sodom; yet she was destroyed by another,\nas we see she is turned into a pillar of salt.\n\nHOPE. True; and she may be to us both caution and example; caution,\nthat we should shun her sin; or a sign of what judgment will overtake\nsuch as shall not be prevented by this caution; so Korah, Dathan,\nand Abiram, with the two hundred and fifty men that perished in\ntheir sin, did also become a sign or example to others to beware.\n[Num. 26:9,10] But above all, I muse at one thing, to wit, how\nDemas and his fellows can stand so confidently yonder to look for\nthat treasure, which this woman, but for looking behind her after,\n(for we read not that she stepped one foot out of the way) was\nturned into a pillar of salt; especially since the judgment which\novertook her did make her an example, within sight of where they\nare; for they cannot choose but see her, did they but lift up their\neyes.\n\n{275} CHR. It is a thing to be wondered at, and it argueth that\ntheir hearts are grown desperate in the case; and I cannot tell who\nto compare them to so fitly, as to them that pick pockets in the\npresence of the judge, or that will cut purses under the gallows.\nIt is said of the men of Sodom, that they were sinners exceedingly,\nbecause they were sinners before the Lord, that is, in his eyesight,\nand notwithstanding the kindnesses that he had showed them [Gen.\n13:13]; for the land of Sodom was now like the garden of Eden\nheretofore.  [Gen. 13:10] This, therefore, provoked him the more\nto jealousy, and made their plague as hot as the fire of the Lord\nout of heaven could make it.  And it is most rationally to be\nconcluded, that such, even such as these are, that shall sin in\nthe sight, yea, and that too in despite of such examples that are\nset continually before them, to caution them to the contrary, must\nbe partakers of severest judgments.\n\nHOPE. Doubtless thou hast said the truth; but what a mercy is it,\nthat neither thou, but especially I, am not made myself this example!\nThis ministereth occasion to us to thank God, to fear before him,\nand always to remember Lot's wife.\n\n{276} I saw, then, that they went on their way to a pleasant river;\nwhich David the king called \"the river of God\", but John, \"the\nriver of the water of life\".  [Ps. 65:9, Rev. 22, Ezek. 47] Now\ntheir way lay just upon the bank of the river; here, therefore,\nChristian and his companion walked with great delight; they drank\nalso of the water of the river, which was pleasant, and enlivening\nto their weary spirits:  besides, on the banks of this river, on\neither side, were green trees, that bore all manner of fruit; and\nthe leaves of the trees were good for medicine; with the fruit of\nthese trees they were also much delighted; and the leaves they eat\nto prevent surfeits, and other diseases that are incident to those\nthat heat their blood by travels.  On either side of the river was\nalso a meadow, curiously beautified with lilies, and it was green\nall the year long.  In this meadow they lay down, and slept; for\nhere they might lie down safely.  When they awoke, they gathered\nagain of the fruit of the trees, and drank again of the water\nof the river, and then lay down again to sleep.  [Ps. 23:2, Isa.\n14:30] Thus they did several days and nights.  Then they sang--\n\n  Behold ye how these crystal streams do glide,\n  To comfort pilgrims by the highway side;\n  The meadows green, beside their fragrant smell,\n  Yield dainties for them; and he that can tell\n  What pleasant fruit, yea, leaves, these trees do yield,\n  Will soon sell all, that he may buy this field.\n\n\nSo when they were disposed to go on, (for they were not, as yet,\nat their journey's end,) they ate and drank, and departed.\n\n{277} Now, I beheld in my dream, that they had not journeyed far,\nbut the river and the way for a time parted; at which they were\nnot a little sorry; yet they durst not go out of the way.  Now the\nway from the river was rough, and their feet tender, by reason of\ntheir travels; so the souls of the pilgrims were much discouraged\nbecause of the way.  [Num. 21:4] Wherefore, still as they went\non, they wished for better way.  Now, a little before them, there\nwas on the left hand of the road a meadow, and a stile to go over\ninto it; and that meadow is called By-path Meadow.  Then said\nChristian to his fellow, If this meadow lieth along by our wayside,\nlet us go over into it.  Then he went to the stile to see, and\nbehold, a path lay along by the way, on the other side of the fence.\nIt is according to my wish, said Christian.  Here is the easiest\ngoing; come, good Hopeful, and let us go over.\n\n{278} HOPE. But how if this path should lead us out of the way?\n\nCHR. That is not like, said the other.  Look, doth it not go along\nby the wayside?  So Hopeful, being persuaded by his fellow, went\nafter him over the stile.  When they were gone over, and were got\ninto the path, they found it very easy for their feet; and withal,\nthey, looking before them, espied a man walking as they did, (and\nhis name was Vain-confidence); so they called after him, and asked\nhim whither that way led.  He said, To the Celestial Gate.  Look,\nsaid Christian, did not I tell you so?  By this you may see we are\nright.  So they followed, and he went before them.  But, behold,\nthe night came on, and it grew very dark; so that they that were\nbehind lost the sight of him that went before.\n\n{279} He, therefore, that went before, (Vain-confidence by name),\nnot seeing the way before him, fell into a deep pit [Isa. 9:16],\nwhich was on purpose there made, by the Prince of those grounds,\nto catch vain-glorious fools withal, and was dashed in pieces with\nhis fall.\n\n{280} Now Christian and his fellow heard him fall.  So they called\nto know the matter, but there was none to answer, only they heard\na groaning.  Then said Hopeful, Where are we now?  Then was his\nfellow silent, as mistrusting that he had led him out of the way;\nand now it began to rain, and thunder, and lighten in a very dreadful\nmanner; and the water rose amain.\n\nThen Hopeful groaned in himself, saying, Oh, that I had kept on my\nway!\n\n{281} CHR. Who could have thought that this path should have led\nus out of the way?\n\nHOPE. I was afraid on it at the very first, and therefore gave you\nthat gentle caution.  I would have spoken plainer, but that you\nare older than I.\n\nChristian's repentance for leading of his brother out of the way\n\nCHR. Good brother, be not offended; I am sorry I have brought thee\nout of the way, and that I have put thee into such imminent danger;\npray, my brother, forgive me; I did not do it of an evil intent.\n\nHOPE. Be comforted, my brother, for I forgive thee; and believe,\ntoo, that this shall be for our good.\n\nCHR. I am glad I have with me a merciful brother; but we must not\nstand thus:  let us try to go back again.\n\nHOPE. But, good brother, let me go before.\n\nCHR. No, if you please, let me go first, that if there be any danger,\nI may be first therein, because by my means we are both gone out\nof the way.\n\n{282} HOPE. No, said Hopeful, you shall not go first; for your\nmind being troubled may lead you out of the way again.  Then, for\ntheir encouragement, they heard the voice of one saying, \"Set thine\nheart toward the highway, even the way which thou wentest; turn\nagain.\"  [Jer. 31:21] But by this time the waters were greatly\nrisen, by reason of which the way of going back was very dangerous.\n(Then I thought that it is easier going out of the way, when we\nare in, than going in when we are out.) Yet they adventured to go\nback, but it was so dark, and the flood was so high, that in their\ngoing back they had like to have been drowned nine or ten times.\n\n{283} Neither could they, with all the skill they had, get again to\nthe stile that night.  Wherefore, at last, lighting under a little\nshelter, they sat down there until the daybreak; but, being weary,\nthey fell asleep.  Now there was, not far from the place where they\nlay, a castle called Doubting Castle, the owner whereof was Giant\nDespair; and it was in his grounds they now were sleeping:  wherefore\nhe, getting up in the morning early, and walking up and down in his\nfields, caught Christian and Hopeful asleep in his grounds.  Then,\nwith a grim and surly voice, he bid them awake; and asked them\nwhence they were, and what they did in his grounds.  They told him\nthey were pilgrims, and that they had lost their way.  Then said\nthe Giant, You have this night trespassed on me, by trampling in\nand lying on my grounds, and therefore you must go along with me.\nSo they were forced to go, because he was stronger than they.  They\nalso had but little to say, for they knew themselves in a fault.\nThe Giant, therefore, drove them before him, and put them into his\ncastle, into a very dark dungeon, nasty and stinking to the spirits\nof these two men.  [Ps. 88:18] Here, then, they lay from Wednesday\nmorning till Saturday night, without one bit of bread, or drop of\ndrink, or light, or any to ask how they did; they were, therefore,\nhere in evil case, and were far from friends and acquaintance.  Now\nin this place Christian had double sorrow, because it was through\nhis unadvised counsel that they were brought into this distress.\n\n\n  The pilgrims now, to gratify the flesh,\n  Will seek its ease; but oh!  how they afresh\n  Do thereby plunge themselves new griefs into!\n  Who seek to please the flesh, themselves undo.\n\n\n{284} Now, Giant Despair had a wife, and her name was Diffidence.\nSo when he was gone to bed, he told his wife what he had done; to\nwit, that he had taken a couple of prisoners and cast them into his\ndungeon, for trespassing on his grounds.  Then he asked her also\nwhat he had best to do further to them.  So she asked him what they\nwere, whence they came, and whither they were bound; and he told\nher.  Then she counselled him that when he arose in the morning he\nshould beat them without any mercy.  So, when he arose, he getteth\nhim a grievous crab-tree cudgel, and goes down into the dungeon\nto them, and there first falls to rating of them as if they were\ndogs, although they never gave him a word of distaste.  Then he\nfalls upon them, and beats them fearfully, in such sort that they\nwere not able to help themselves, or to turn them upon the floor.\nThis done, he withdraws and leaves them there to condole their\nmisery and to mourn under their distress.  So all that day they\nspent the time in nothing but sighs and bitter lamentations.  The\nnext night, she, talking with her husband about them further, and\nunderstanding they were yet alive, did advise him to counsel them\nto make away themselves.  So when morning was come, he goes to them\nin a surly manner as before, and perceiving them to be very sore\nwith the stripes that he had given them the day before, he told\nthem, that since they were never like to come out of that place,\ntheir only way would be forthwith to make an end of themselves,\neither with knife, halter, or poison, for why, said he, should you\nchoose life, seeing it is attended with so much bitterness?  But\nthey desired him to let them go.  With that he looked ugly upon\nthem, and, rushing to them, had doubtless made an end of them\nhimself, but that he fell into one of his fits, (for he sometimes, in\nsunshiny weather, fell into fits), and lost for a time the use of\nhis hand; wherefore he withdrew, and left them as before, to consider\nwhat to do.  Then did the prisoners consult between themselves\nwhether it was best to take his counsel or no; and thus they began\nto discourse:--\n\n{285} CHR. Brother, said Christian, what shall we do?  The life that\nwe now live is miserable.  For my part I know not whether is best,\nto live thus, or to die out of hand.  \"My soul chooseth strangling\nrather than life\", and the grave is more easy for me than this\ndungeon.  [Job 7:15] Shall we be ruled by the Giant?\n\n{286} HOPE. Indeed, our present condition is dreadful, and death\nwould be far more welcome to me than thus for ever to abide;\nbut yet, let us consider, the Lord of the country to which we are\ngoing hath said, Thou shalt do no murder:  no, not to another man's\nperson; much more, then, are we forbidden to take his counsel to\nkill ourselves.  Besides, he that kills another, can but commit\nmurder upon his body; but for one to kill himself is to kill body\nand soul at once.  And, moreover, my brother, thou talkest of ease\nin the grave; but hast thou forgotten the hell, for certain the\nmurderers go?  \"For no murderer hath eternal life,\" &c.  And let\nus consider, again, that all the law is not in the hand of Giant\nDespair.  Others, so far as I can understand, have been taken\nby him, as well as we; and yet have escaped out of his hand.  Who\nknows, but the God that made the world may cause that Giant Despair\nmay die?  or that, at some time or other, he may forget to lock\nus in?  or that he may, in a short time, have another of his fits\nbefore us, and may lose the use of his limbs?  and if ever that\nshould come to pass again, for my part, I am resolved to pluck\nup the heart of a man, and to try my utmost to get from under his\nhand.  I was a fool that I did not try to do it before; but, however,\nmy brother, let us be patient, and endure a while.  The time may\ncome that may give us a happy release; but let us not be our own\nmurderers.  With these words Hopeful at present did moderate the\nmind of his brother; so they continued together (in the dark) that\nday, in their sad and doleful condition.\n\n{287} Well, towards evening, the Giant goes down into the dungeon\nagain, to see if his prisoners had taken his counsel; but when he\ncame there he found them alive; and truly, alive was all; for now,\nwhat for want of bread and water, and by reason of the wounds they\nreceived when he beat them, they could do little but breathe.  But,\nI say, he found them alive; at which he fell into a grievous rage,\nand told them that, seeing they had disobeyed his counsel, it should\nbe worse with them than if they had never been born.\n\n{288} At this they trembled greatly, and I think that Christian fell\ninto a swoon; but, coming a little to himself again, they renewed\ntheir discourse about the Giant's counsel; and whether yet they\nhad best to take it or no.  Now Christian again seemed to be for\ndoing it, but Hopeful made his second reply as followeth:--\n\n{289} HOPE. My brother, said he, rememberest thou not how valiant\nthou hast been heretofore?  Apollyon could not crush thee, nor\ncould all that thou didst hear, or see, or feel, in the Valley of\nthe Shadow of Death.  What hardship, terror, and amazement hast\nthou already gone through!  And art thou now nothing but fear!\nThou seest that I am in the dungeon with thee, a far weaker man by\nnature than thou art; also, this Giant has wounded me as well as\nthee, and hath also cut off the bread and water from my mouth; and\nwith thee I mourn without the light.  But let us exercise a little\nmore patience; remember how thou playedst the man at Vanity Fair,\nand wast neither afraid of the chain, nor cage, nor yet of bloody\ndeath.  Wherefore let us (at least to avoid the shame, that becomes\nnot a Christian to be found in) bear up with patience as well as\nwe can.\n\n{290} Now, night being come again, and the Giant and his wife being\nin bed, she asked him concerning the prisoners, and if they had\ntaken his counsel.  To which he replied, They are sturdy rogues, they\nchoose rather to bear all hardship, than to make away themselves.\nThen said she, Take them into the castle-yard to-morrow, and show\nthem the bones and skulls of those that thou hast already despatched,\nand make them believe, ere a week comes to an end, thou also wilt\ntear them in pieces, as thou hast done their fellows before them.\n\n{291} So when the morning was come, the Giant goes to them again,\nand takes them into the castle-yard, and shows them, as his wife\nhad bidden him.  These, said he, were pilgrims as you are, once,\nand they trespassed in my grounds, as you have done; and when I\nthought fit, I tore them in pieces, and so, within ten days, I will\ndo you.  Go, get you down to your den again; and with that he beat\nthem all the way thither.  They lay, therefore, all day on Saturday\nin a lamentable case, as before.  Now, when night was come, and\nwhen Mrs. Diffidence and her husband, the Giant, were got to bed,\nthey began to renew their discourse of their prisoners; and withal\nthe old Giant wondered, that he could neither by his blows nor\nhis counsel bring them to an end.  And with that his wife replied,\nI fear, said she, that they live in hope that some will come to\nrelieve them, or that they have picklocks about them, by the means\nof which they hope to escape.  And sayest thou so, my dear?  said\nthe Giant; I will, therefore, search them in the morning.\n\n{292} Well, on Saturday, about midnight, they began to pray, and\ncontinued in prayer till almost break of day.\n\nNow a little before it was day, good Christian, as one half amazed,\nbrake out in passionate speech:  What a fool, quoth he, am I, thus\nto lie in a stinking Dungeon, when I may as well walk at liberty.\nI have a Key in my bosom called Promise, that will, I am persuaded,\nopen any Lock in Doubting Castle.  Then said Hopeful, That's good\nnews; good Brother pluck it out of thy bosom and try.\n\nA key in Christian's bosom, called Promise, opens any lock in\nDoubting Castle\n\nThen Christian pulled it out of his bosom, and began to try at the\nDungeon door, whose bolt (as he turned the Key) gave back, and the\ndoor flew open with ease, and Christian and Hopeful both came out.\nThen he went to the outward door that leads into the Castle-yard,\nand with his Key opened that door also.  After he went to the iron\nGate, for that must be opened too, but that Lock went damnable\nhard, yet the Key did open it.  Then they thrust open the Gate to\nmake their escape with speed; but that Gate as it opened made such\na creaking, that it waked Giant Despair, who hastily rising to\npursue his Prisoners, felt his limbs to fail, for his Fits took\nhim again, so that he could by no means go after them.  Then they\nwent on, and came to the King's High-way again, and so were safe,\nbecause they were out of his jurisdiction\n\n{294} Now, when they were over the stile, they began to contrive\nwith themselves what they should do at that stile to prevent those\nthat should come after from falling into the hands of Giant Despair.\nSo they consented to erect there a pillar, and to engrave upon the\nside thereof this sentence--\"Over this stile is the way to Doubting\nCastle, which is kept by Giant Despair, who despiseth the King of\nthe Celestial Country, and seeks to destroy his holy pilgrims.\"\nMany, therefore, that followed after read what was written, and\nescaped the danger.  This done, they sang as follows:--\n\n  Out of the way we went, and then we found\n  What 'twas to tread upon forbidden ground;\n  And let them that come after have a care,\n  Lest heedlessness makes them, as we, to fare.\n  Lest they for trespassing his prisoners are,\n  Whose castle's Doubting, and whose name's Despair.\n\n\n{295} They went then till they came to the Delectable Mountains,\nwhich mountains belong to the Lord of that hill of which we have\nspoken before; so they went up to the mountains, to behold the\ngardens and orchards, the vineyards and fountains of water; where\nalso they drank and washed themselves, and did freely eat of the\nvineyards.  Now there were on the tops of these mountains Shepherds\nfeeding their flocks, and they stood by the highway side.  The\nPilgrims therefore went to them, and leaning upon their staves, (as\nis common with weary pilgrims when they stand to talk with any by\nthe way), they asked, Whose Delectable Mountains are these?  And\nwhose be the sheep that feed upon them?\n\n\n  Mountains delectable they now ascend,\n  Where Shepherds be, which to them do commend\n  Alluring things, and things that cautious are,\n  Pilgrims are steady kept by faith and fear.\n\n\n{296} SHEP. These mountains are Immanuel's Land, and they are\nwithin sight of his city; and the sheep also are his, and he laid\ndown his life for them.  [John 10:11]\n\nCHR. Is this the way to the Celestial City?\n\nSHEP. You are just in your way.\n\nCHR. How far is it thither?\n\nSHEP. Too far for any but those that shall get thither indeed.\n\nCHR. Is the way safe or dangerous?\n\nSHEP. Safe for those for whom it is to be safe; but the transgressors\nshall fall therein.  [Hos. 14:9]\n\nCHR. Is there, in this place, any relief for pilgrims that are\nweary and faint in the way?\n\nSHEP. The Lord of these mountains hath given us a charge not to be\nforgetful to entertain strangers, therefore the good of the place\nis before you.  [Heb. 13:1-2]\n\n{297} I saw also in my dream, that when the Shepherds perceived\nthat they were wayfaring men, they also put questions to them, to\nwhich they made answer as in other places; as, Whence came you?\nand, How got you into the way?  and, By what means have you so\npersevered therein?  For but few of them that begin to come hither\ndo show their face on these mountains.  But when the Shepherds heard\ntheir answers, being pleased therewith, they looked very lovingly\nupon them, and said, Welcome to the Delectable Mountains.\n\n{298} The Shepherds, I say, whose names were Knowledge, Experience,\nWatchful, and Sincere, took them by the hand, and had them to their\ntents, and made them partake of that which was ready at present.\nThey said, moreover, We would that ye should stay here awhile, to\nbe acquainted with us; and yet more to solace yourselves with the\ngood of these Delectable Mountains.  They then told them, that\nthey were content to stay; so they went to their rest that night,\nbecause it was very late.\n\n{299} Then I saw in my dream, that in the morning the Shepherds called\nup to Christian and Hopeful to walk with them upon the mountains;\nso they went forth with them, and walked a while, having a pleasant\nprospect on every side.  Then said the Shepherds one to another,\nShall we show these pilgrims some wonders?  So when they had concluded\nto do it, they had them first to the top of a hill called Error,\nwhich was very steep on the furthest side, and bid them look down\nto the bottom.  So Christian and Hopeful looked down, and saw at\nthe bottom several men dashed all to pieces by a fall that they\nhad from the top.  Then said Christian, What meaneth this?  The\nShepherds answered, Have you not heard of them that were made to\nerr by hearkening to Hymeneus and Philetus as concerning the faith\nof the resurrection of the body?  [2 Tim. 2:17,18] They answered,\nYes.  Then said the Shepherds, Those that you see lie dashed\nin pieces at the bottom of this mountain are they; and they have\ncontinued to this day unburied, as you see, for an example to others\nto take heed how they clamber too high, or how they come too near\nthe brink of this mountain.\n\n{300} Then I saw that they had them to the top of another mountain,\nand the name of that is Caution, and bid them look afar off; which,\nwhen they did, they perceived, as they thought, several men walking\nup and down among the tombs that were there; and they perceived\nthat the men were blind, because they stumbled sometimes upon the\ntombs, and because they could not get out from among them.  Then\nsaid Christian, What means this?\n\n{301} The Shepherds then answered, Did you not see a little below\nthese mountains a stile, that led into a meadow, on the left hand\nof this way?  They answered, Yes.  Then said the Shepherds, From\nthat stile there goes a path that leads directly to Doubting Castle,\nwhich is kept by Giant Despair, and these, pointing to them among\nthe tombs, came once on pilgrimage, as you do now, even till they\ncame to that same stile; and because the right way was rough in\nthat place, they chose to go out of it into that meadow, and there\nwere taken by Giant Despair, and cast into Doubting Castle; where,\nafter they had been a while kept in the dungeon, he at last did put\nout their eyes, and led them among those tombs, where he has left\nthem to wander to this very day, that the saying of the wise man might\nbe fulfilled, \"He that wandereth out of the way of understanding,\nshall remain in the congregation of the dead.\"  [Pro. 21:16] Then\nChristian and Hopeful looked upon one another, with tears gushing\nout, but yet said nothing to the Shepherds.\n\n{302} Then I saw in my dream, that the Shepherds had them to another\nplace, in a bottom, where was a door in the side of a hill, and they\nopened the door, and bid them look in.  They looked in, therefore,\nand saw that within it was very dark and smoky; they also thought\nthat they heard there a rumbling noise as of fire, and a cry of\nsome tormented, and that they smelt the scent of brimstone.  Then\nsaid Christian, What means this?  The Shepherds told them, This is\na by-way to hell, a way that hypocrites go in at; namely, such as\nsell their birthright, with Esau; such as sell their master, with\nJudas; such as blaspheme the gospel, with Alexander; and that\nlie and dissemble, with Ananias and Sapphira his wife.  Then said\nHopeful to the Shepherds, I perceive that these had on them, even\nevery one, a show of pilgrimage, as we have now; had they not?\n\n{303} SHEP. Yes, and held it a long time too.\n\nHOPE. How far might they go on in pilgrimage in their day, since\nthey notwithstanding were thus miserably cast away?\n\nSHEP. Some further, and some not so far, as these mountains.\n\nThen said the Pilgrims one to another, We have need to cry to the\nStrong for strength.\n\nSHEP. Ay, and you will have need to use it, when you have it, too.\n\n{304} By this time the Pilgrims had a desire to go forward, and\nthe Shepherds a desire they should; so they walked together towards\nthe end of the mountains.  Then said the Shepherds one to another,\nLet us here show to the Pilgrims the gates of the Celestial City,\nif they have skill to look through our perspective glass.  The\nPilgrims then lovingly accepted the motion; so they had them to\nthe top of a high hill, called Clear, and gave them their glass to\nlook.\n\n{305} Then they essayed to look, but the remembrance of that last\nthing that the Shepherds had shown them, made their hands shake;\nby means of which impediment, they could not look steadily through\nthe glass; yet they thought they saw something like the gate, and\nalso some of the glory of the place.  Then they went away, and sang\nthis song--\n\n  Thus, by the Shepherds, secrets are reveal'd,\n  Which from all other men are kept conceal'd.\n  Come to the Shepherds, then, if you would see\n  Things deep, things hid, and that mysterious be.\n\n\n{306} When they were about to depart, one of the Shepherds gave\nthem a note of the way.  Another of them bid them beware of the\nFlatterer.  The third bid them take heed that they sleep not upon\nthe Enchanted Ground.  And the fourth bid them God-speed.  So I\nawoke from my dream.\n\n{307} And I slept, and dreamed again, and saw the same two Pilgrims\ngoing down the mountains along the highway towards the city.  Now,\na little below these mountains, on the left hand, lieth the country\nof Conceit; from which country there comes into the way in which\nthe Pilgrims walked, a little crooked lane.  Here, therefore, they\nmet with a very brisk lad, that came out of that country; and his\nname was Ignorance.  So Christian asked him from what parts he\ncame, and whither he was going.\n\n{308} IGNOR. Sir, I was born in the country that lieth off there\na little on the left hand, and I am going to the Celestial City.\n\nCHR. But how do you think to get in at the gate?  for you may find\nsome difficulty there.\n\nIGNOR. As other people do, said he.\n\nCHR. But what have you to show at that gate, that may cause that\nthe gate should be opened to you?\n\nIGNOR. I know my Lord's will, and I have been a good liver; I pay\nevery man his own; I pray, fast, pay tithes, and give alms, and\nhave left my country for whither I am going.\n\n{309} CHR. But thou camest not in at the wicket-gate that is at the\nhead of this way; thou camest in hither through that same crooked\nlane, and therefore, I fear, however thou mayest think of thyself,\nwhen the reckoning day shall come, thou wilt have laid to thy charge\nthat thou art a thief and a robber, instead of getting admittance\ninto the city.\n\nIGNOR. Gentlemen, ye be utter strangers to me, I know you not; be\ncontent and follow the religion of your country, and I will follow\nthe religion of mine.  I hope all will be well.  And as for the\ngate that you talk of, all the world knows that that is a great way\noff of our country.  I cannot think that any man in all our parts\ndoth so much as know the way to it, nor need they matter whether\nthey do or no, since we have, as you see, a fine, pleasant green\nlane, that comes down from our country, the next way into the way.\n\n{310} When Christian saw that the man was \"wise in his own conceit\",\nhe said to Hopeful, whisperingly, \"There is more hope of a fool\nthan of him.\"  [Prov. 26:12] And said, moreover, \"When he that is\na fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth him, and he saith to\nevery one that he is a fool.\"  [Eccl. 10:3] What, shall we talk\nfurther with him, or out-go him at present, and so leave him to\nthink of what he hath heard already, and then stop again for him\nafterwards, and see if by degrees we can do any good to him?  Then\nsaid Hopeful--\n\n  Let Ignorance a little while now muse\n  On what is said, and let him not refuse\n  Good counsel to embrace, lest he remain\n  Still ignorant of what's the chiefest gain.\n  God saith, those that no understanding have,\n  Although he made them, them he will not save.\n\n\nHOPE. He further added, It is not good, I think, to say all to him\nat once; let us pass him by, if you will, and talk to him anon,\neven as he is able to bear it.\n\n{311} So they both went on, and Ignorance he came after.  Now when\nthey had passed him a little way, they entered into a very dark\nlane, where they met a man whom seven devils had bound with seven\nstrong cords, and were carrying of him back to the door that they\nsaw on the side of the hill.  [Matt. 12:45, Prov. 5:22] Now good\nChristian began to tremble, and so did Hopeful his companion; yet\nas the devils led away the man, Christian looked to see if he knew\nhim; and he thought it might be one Turn-away, that dwelt in the\ntown of Apostasy.  But he did not perfectly see his face, for he\ndid hang his head like a thief that is found.  But being once past,\nHopeful looked after him, and espied on his back a paper with this\ninscription, \"Wanton professor and damnable apostate\".\n\nThen said Christian to his fellow, Now I call to remembrance, that\nwhich was told me of a thing that happened to a good man hereabout.\nThe name of the man was Little-faith, but a good man, and he dwelt\nin the town of Sincere.  The thing was this:--At the entering\nin at this passage, there comes down from Broad-way Gate, a lane\ncalled Dead Man's Lane; so called because of the murders that are\ncommonly done there; and this Little-faith going on pilgrimage,\nas we do now, chanced to sit down there, and slept.  Now there\nhappened, at that time, to come down the lane, from Broad-way Gate,\nthree sturdy rogues, and their names were Faint-heart, Mistrust,\nand Guilt, (three brothers), and they espying Little-faith, where\nhe was, came galloping up with speed.  Now the good man was just\nawake from his sleep, and was getting up to go on his journey.\nSo they came up all to him, and with threatening language bid him\nstand.  At this Little-faith looked as white as a clout, and had\nneither power to fight nor fly.  Then said Faint-heart, Deliver thy\npurse.  But he making no haste to do it (for he was loath to lose\nhis money), Mistrust ran up to him, and thrusting his hand into\nhis pocket, pulled out thence a bag of silver.  Then he cried out,\nThieves!  Thieves!  With that Guilt, with a great club that was\nin his hand, struck Little-faith on the head, and with that blow\nfelled him flat to the ground, where he lay bleeding as one that\nwould bleed to death.  All this while the thieves stood by.  But,\nat last, they hearing that some were upon the road, and fearing\nlest it should be one Great-grace, that dwells in the city of\nGood-confidence, they betook themselves to their heels, and left\nthis good man to shift for himself.  Now, after a while, Little-faith\ncame to himself, and getting up, made shift to scrabble on his way.\nThis was the story.\n\n{312} HOPE. But did they take from him all that ever he had?\n\nChr.  No; the place where his jewels were they never ransacked, so\nthose he kept still.  But, as I was told, the good man was much afflicted\nfor his loss, for the thieves got most of his spending-money.  That\nwhich they got not (as I said) were jewels, also he had a little\nodd money left, but scarce enough to bring him to his journey's\nend [1 Peter 4:18]; nay, if I was not misinformed, he was forced\nto beg as he went, to keep himself alive; for his jewels he might\nnot sell.  But beg, and do what he could, he went (as we say) with\nmany a hungry belly the most part of the rest of the way.\n\n{313} HOPE. But is it not a wonder they got not from him his certificate,\nby which he was to receive his admittance at the Celestial Gate?\n\nCHR. It is a wonder; but they got not that, though they missed it\nnot through any good cunning of his; for he, being dismayed with\ntheir coming upon him, had neither power nor skill to hide anything;\nso it was more by good Providence than by his endeavour, that they\nmissed of that good thing.\n\n{314} HOPE. But it must needs be a comfort to him, that they got\nnot his jewels from him.\n\nCHR. It might have been great comfort to him, had he used it as\nhe should; but they that told me the story said, that he made but\nlittle use of it all the rest of the way, and that because of the\ndismay that he had in the taking away his money; indeed, he forgot\nit a great part of the rest of his journey; and besides, when at any\ntime it came into his mind, and he began to be comforted therewith,\nthen would fresh thoughts of his loss come again upon him, and\nthose thoughts would swallow up all.  [1 Peter 1:9]\n\n{315} HOPE. Alas!  poor man!  This could not but be a great grief\nto him.\n\nCHR. Grief!  ay, a grief indeed.  Would it not have been so to any\nof us, had we been used as he, to be robbed, and wounded too, and\nthat in a strange place, as he was?  It is a wonder he did not die\nwith grief, poor heart!  I was told that he scattered almost all\nthe rest of the way with nothing but doleful and bitter complaints;\ntelling also to all that overtook him, or that he overtook in the\nway as he went, where he was robbed, and how; who they were that\ndid it, and what he lost; how he was wounded, and that he hardly\nescaped with his life.\n\n{316} HOPE. But it is a wonder that his necessity did not put him\nupon selling or pawning some of his jewels, that he might have\nwherewith to relieve himself in his journey.\n\nCHR. Thou talkest like one upon whose head is the shell to this\nvery day; for what should he pawn them, or to whom should he sell\nthem?  In all that country where he was robbed, his jewels were not\naccounted of; nor did he want that relief which could from thence\nbe administered to him.  Besides, had his jewels been missing at the\ngate of the Celestial City, he had (and that he knew well enough)\nbeen excluded from an inheritance there; and that would have been\nworse to him than the appearance and villainy of ten thousand\nthieves.\n\n{317} HOPE. Why art thou so tart, my brother?  Esau sold his\nbirthright, and that for a mess of pottage, and that birthright\nwas his greatest jewel; and if he, why might not Little-faith do\nso too?  [Heb. 12:16]\n\nCHR. Esau did sell his birthright indeed, and so do many besides,\nand by so doing exclude themselves from the chief blessing, as\nalso that caitiff did; but you must put a difference betwixt Esau\nand Little-faith, and also betwixt their estates.  Esau's birthright\nwas typical, but Little-faith's jewels were not so; Esau's belly\nwas his god, but Little-faith's belly was not so; Esau's want lay\nin his fleshly appetite, Little-faith's did not so.  Besides, Esau\ncould see no further than to the fulfilling of his lusts; \"Behold,\nI am at the point to die, (said he), and what profit shall this\nbirthright do me?\"  [Gen. 25:32] But Little-faith, though it was\nhis lot to have but a little faith, was by his little faith kept\nfrom such extravagances, and made to see and prize his jewels\nmore than to sell them, as Esau did his birthright.  You read not\nanywhere that Esau had faith, no, not so much as a little; therefore,\nno marvel if, where the flesh only bears sway, (as it will in that\nman where no faith is to resist), if he sells his birthright, and\nhis soul and all, and that to the devil of hell; for it is with\nsuch, as it is with the ass, who in her occasions cannot be turned\naway.  [Jer. 2:24] When their minds are set upon their lusts,\nthey will have them whatever they cost.  But Little-faith was of\nanother temper, his mind was on things divine; his livelihood was\nupon things that were spiritual, and from above; therefore, to what\nend should he that is of such a temper sell his jewels (had there\nbeen any that would have bought them) to fill his mind with empty\nthings?  Will a man give a penny to fill his belly with hay; or can\nyou persuade the turtle-dove to live upon carrion like the crow?\nThough faithless ones can, for carnal lusts, pawn, or mortgage,\nor sell what they have, and themselves outright to boot; yet they\nthat have faith, saving faith, though but a little of it, cannot\ndo so.  Here, therefore, my brother, is thy mistake.\n\n{318} HOPE. I acknowledge it; but yet your severe reflection had\nalmost made me angry.\n\nCHR. Why, I did but compare thee to some of the birds that are of\nthe brisker sort, who will run to and fro in untrodden paths, with\nthe shell upon their heads; but pass by that, and consider the\nmatter under debate, and all shall be well betwixt thee and me.\n\nHOPE. But, Christian, these three fellows, I am persuaded in\nmy heart, are but a company of cowards; would they have run else,\nthink you, as they did, at the noise of one that was coming on\nthe road?  Why did not Little-faith pluck up a greater heart?  He\nmight, methinks, have stood one brush with them, and have yielded\nwhen there had been no remedy.\n\nCHR. That they are cowards, many have said, but few have found it\nso in the time of trial.  As for a great heart, Little-faith had\nnone; and I perceive by thee, my brother, hadst thou been the man\nconcerned, thou art but for a brush, and then to yield.\n\nAnd, verily, since this is the height of thy stomach, now they are\nat a distance from us, should they appear to thee as they did to\nhim they might put thee to second thoughts.\n\n{319} But, consider again, they are but journeymen thieves, they\nserve under the king of the bottomless pit, who, if need be, will\ncome into their aid himself, and his voice is as the roaring of a\nlion.  [1 Pet. 5:8] I myself have been engaged as this Little-faith\nwas, and I found it a terrible thing.  These three villains set\nupon me, and I beginning, like a Christian, to resist, they gave\nbut a call, and in came their master.  I would, as the saying is,\nhave given my life for a penny, but that, as God would have it,\nI was clothed with armour of proof.  Ay, and yet, though I was so\nharnessed, I found it hard work to quit myself like a man.  No man\ncan tell what in that combat attends us, but he that hath been in\nthe battle himself.\n\n{320} HOPE. Well, but they ran, you see, when they did but suppose\nthat one Great-grace was in the way.\n\nCHR. True, they have often fled, both they and their master, when\nGreat-grace hath but appeared; and no marvel; for he is the King's\nchampion.  But, I trow, you will put some difference betwixt\nLittle-faith and the King's champion.  All the King's subjects\nare not his champions, nor can they, when tried, do such feats of\nwar as he.  Is it meet to think that a little child should handle\nGoliath as David did?  Or that there should be the strength of\nan ox in a wren?  Some are strong, some are weak; some have great\nfaith, some have little.  This man was one of the weak, and therefore\nhe went to the wall.\n\n{321} HOPE. I would it had been Great-grace for their sakes.\n\nCHR. If it had been, he might have had his hands full; for I must\ntell you, that though Great-grace is excellent good at his weapons,\nand has, and can, so long as he keeps them at sword's point, do well\nenough with them; yet, if they get within him, even Faint-heart,\nMistrust, or the other, it shall go hard but they will throw up\nhis heels.  And when a man is down, you know, what can he do?\n\n{322} Whoso looks well upon Great-grace's face, shall see those\nscars and cuts there, that shall easily give demonstration of what\nI say.  Yea, once I heard that he should say, (and that when he was\nin the combat), \"We despaired even of life.\"  How did these sturdy\nrogues and their fellows make David groan, mourn, and roar?  Yea,\nHeman, and Hezekiah, too, though champions in their day, were forced\nto bestir them, when by these assaulted; and yet, notwithstanding,\nthey had their coats soundly brushed by them.  Peter, upon a time,\nwould go try what he could do; but though some do say of him that\nhe is the prince of the apostles, they handled him so, that they\nmade him at last afraid of a sorry girl.\n\n{323} Leviathan's sturdiness\n\nBesides, their king is at their whistle.  He is never out of hearing;\nand if at any time they be put to the worst, he, if possible, comes in\nto help them; and of him it is said, The sword of him that layeth\nat him cannot hold the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon; he\nesteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.  The arrow cannot\nmake him flee; sling stones are turned with him into stubble.  Darts\nare counted as stubble:  he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.\n[Job 41:26-29] What can a man do in this case?  It is true, if a man\ncould, at every turn, have Job's horse, and had skill and courage\nto ride him, he might do notable things; for his neck is clothed\nwith thunder, he will not be afraid of the grasshopper; the glory\nof his nostrils is terrible:  he paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth\nin his strength, he goeth on to meet the armed men.  He mocketh\nat fear, and is not affrighted, neither turneth he back from the\nsword.  The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear, and\nthe shield.  He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage,\nneither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet. He saith\namong the trumpets, Ha, ha!  and he smelleth the battle afar off,\nthe thunder of the captains, and the shouting.  [Job 39:19-25]\n\n{324} But for such footmen as thee and I are, let us never desire\nto meet with an enemy, nor vaunt as if we could do better, when we\nhear of others that they have been foiled, Nor be tickled at the\nthoughts of our own manhood; for such commonly come by the worst\nwhen tried.  Witness Peter, of whom I made mention before.  He would\nswagger, ay, he would; he would, as his vain mind prompted him to\nsay, do better, and stand more for his Master than all men; but\nwho so foiled, and run down by these villains, as he?\n\nWhen, therefore, we hear that such robberies are done on the King's\nhighway, two things become us to do:\n\n{325} 1.  To go out harnessed, and to be sure to take a shield with\nus; for it was for want of that, that he that laid so lustily at\nLeviathan could not make him yield; for, indeed, if that be wanting,\nhe fears us not at all.  Therefore, he that had skill hath said,\n\"Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able\nto quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.\"  [Eph. 6:16]\n\n{326} 2.  It is good, also, that we desire of the King a convoy,\nyea, that he will go with us himself.  This made David rejoice\nwhen in the Valley of the Shadow of Death; and Moses was rather for\ndying where he stood, than to go one step without his God.  [Exo.\n33:15] Oh, my brother, if he will but go along with us, what need\nwe be afraid of ten thousands that shall set themselves against\nus?  [Ps. 3:5-8, 27:1-3] But, without him, the proud helpers \"fall\nunder the slain\".  [Isa. 10:4]\n\n{327} I, for my part, have been in the fray before now; and though,\nthrough the goodness of him that is best, I am, as you see, alive,\nyet I cannot boast of my manhood.  Glad shall I be, if I meet\nwith no more such brunts; though I fear we are not got beyond all\ndanger.  However, since the lion and the bear have not as yet devoured\nme, I hope God will also deliver us from the next uncircumcised\nPhilistine.  Then sang Christian--\n\n  Poor Little-faith!  Hast been among the thieves?\n  Wast robb'd?  Remember this, whoso believes,\n  And gets more faith, shall then a victor be\n  Over ten thousand, else scarce over three.\n\n\n{328} So they went on and Ignorance followed.  They went then till\nthey came at a place where they saw a way put itself into their way,\nand seemed withal to lie as straight as the way which they should\ngo:  and here they knew not which of the two to take, for both\nseemed straight before them; therefore, here they stood still to\nconsider.  And as they were thinking about the way, behold a man,\nblack of flesh, but covered with a very light robe, came to them,\nand asked them why they stood there.  They answered they were going\nto the Celestial City, but knew not which of these ways to take.\nFollow me, said the man, it is thither that I am going.  So they\nfollowed him in the way that but now came into the road, which by\ndegrees turned, and turned them so from the city that they desired\nto go to, that, in little time, their faces were turned away from\nit; yet they followed him.  But by and by, before they were aware,\nhe led them both within the compass of a net, in which they were\nboth so entangled that they knew not what to do; and with that the\nwhite robe fell off the black man's back.  Then they saw where they\nwere.  Wherefore, there they lay crying some time, for they could\nnot get themselves out.\n\n{329} CHR. Then said Christian to his fellow, Now do I see myself\nin error.  Did not the Shepherds bid us beware of the flatterers?\nAs is the saying of the wise man, so we have found it this day.  A\nman that flattereth his neighbour, spreadeth a net for his feet.\n[Prov. 29:5]\n\nHOPE. They also gave us a note of directions about the way, for\nour more sure finding thereof; but therein we have also forgotten\nto read, and have not kept ourselves from the paths of the destroyer.\nHere David was wiser than we; for, saith he, \"Concerning the works\nof men, by the word of thy lips, I have kept me from the paths of\nthe destroyer.\"  [Ps. 17:4] Thus they lay bewailing themselves\nin the net.  At last they espied a Shining One coming towards them\nwith a whip of small cord in his hand.  When he was come to the\nplace where they were, he asked them whence they came, and what\nthey did there.  They told him that they were poor pilgrims going\nto Zion, but were led out of their way by a black man, clothed in\nwhite, who bid us, said they, follow him, for he was going thither\ntoo.  Then said he with the whip, It is Flatterer, a false apostle,\nthat hath transformed himself into an angel of light.  [Prov. 29:5,\nDan.  11:32, 2 Cor. 11:13,14] So he rent the net, and let the men\nout.  Then said he to them, Follow me, that I may set you in your\nway again.  So he led them back to the way which they had left to\nfollow the Flatterer.  Then he asked them, saying, Where did you lie\nthe last night?  They said, With the Shepherds upon the Delectable\nMountains.  He asked them then if they had not of those Shepherds\na note of direction for the way.  They answered, Yes.  But did you,\nsaid he, when you were at a stand, pluck out and read your note?\nThey answered, No.  He asked them, Why?  They said, they forgot.\nHe asked, moreover, if the Shepherds did not bid them beware of\nthe Flatterer?  They answered, Yes, but we did not imagine, said\nthey, that this fine-spoken man had been he.  [Rom. 16:18]\n\n{330} Then I saw in my dream that he commanded them to lie down;\nwhich, when they did, he chastised them sore, to teach them the\ngood way wherein they should walk [Deut. 25:2]; and as he chastised\nthem he said, \"As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten; be zealous,\ntherefore, and repent.\"  [2 Chron. 6:26,27, Rev. 3:19] This\ndone, he bid them go on their way, and take good heed to the other\ndirections of the shepherds.  So they thanked him for all his\nkindness, and went softly along the right way, singing--\n\n\n  Come hither, you that walk along the way;\n  See how the pilgrims fare that go astray.\n  They catched are in an entangling net,\n  'Cause they good counsel lightly did forget:\n  'Tis true they rescued were, but yet you see,\n  They're scourged to boot.  Let this your caution be.\n\n\n{331} Now, after a while, they perceived, afar off, one coming\nsoftly and alone, all along the highway to meet them.  Then said\nChristian to his fellow, Yonder is a man with his back towards\nZion, and he is coming to meet us.\n\nHOPE. I see him; let us take heed to ourselves now, lest he should\nprove a flatterer also.  So he drew nearer and nearer, and at last\ncame up unto them.  His name was Atheist, and he asked them whither\nthey were going.\n\nCHR. We are going to Mount Zion.\n\nThen Atheist fell into a very great laughter.\n\nCHR. What is the meaning of your laughter?\n\n{332} ATHEIST. I laugh to see what ignorant persons you are, to\ntake upon you so tedious a journey, and you are like to have nothing\nbut your travel for your pains.\n\nCHR. Why, man, do you think we shall not be received?\n\nATHEIST. Received!  There is no such place as you dream of in all\nthis world.\n\nCHR. But there is in the world to come.\n\n{333} ATHEIST. When I was at home in mine own country, I heard as\nyou now affirm, and from that hearing went out to see, and have\nbeen seeking this city this twenty years; but find no more of it\nthan I did the first day I set out.  [Jer. 22:12, Eccl. 10:15]\n\nCHR. We have both heard and believe that there is such a place to\nbe found.\n\nATHEIST. Had not I, when at home, believed, I had not come thus far\nto seek; but finding none, (and yet I should, had there been such\na place to be found, for I have gone to seek it further than you),\nI am going back again, and will seek to refresh myself with the\nthings that I then cast away, for hopes of that which, I now see,\nis not.\n\n{334} CHR. Then said Christian to Hopeful his fellow, Is it true\nwhich this man hath said?\n\nHopeful's gracious answer\n\nHope.  Take heed, he is one of the flatterers; remember what it hath\ncost us once already for our hearkening to such kind of fellows.\nWhat!  no Mount Zion?  Did we not see, from the Delectable Mountains\nthe gate of the city?  Also, are we not now to walk by faith?  Let\nus go on, said Hopeful, lest the man with the whip overtake us\nagain.  [2 Cor. 5:7] You should have taught me that lesson, which\nI will round you in the ears withal:  \"Cease, my son, to hear\nthe instruction that causeth to err from the words of knowledge.\"\n[Prov. 19:27] I say, my brother, cease to hear him, and let us\n\"believe to the saving of the soul\".  [Heb. 10:39]\n\n{335} CHR. My brother, I did not put the question to thee for that\nI doubted of the truth of our belief myself, but to prove thee,\nand to fetch from thee a fruit of the honesty of thy heart.  As\nfor this man, I know that he is blinded by the god of this world.\nLet thee and I go on, knowing that we have belief of the truth,\n\"and no lie is of the truth\".  [1 John 2:21]\n\nHOPE. Now do I rejoice in hope of the glory of God.  So they turned\naway from the man; and he, laughing at them, went his way.\n\n{336} I saw then in my dream, that they went till they came into\na certain country, whose air naturally tended to make one drowsy,\nif he came a stranger into it.  And here Hopeful began to be very\ndull and heavy of sleep; wherefore he said unto Christian, I do\nnow begin to grow so drowsy that I can scarcely hold up mine eyes,\nlet us lie down here and take one nap.\n\nCHR. By no means, said the other, lest sleeping, we never awake\nmore.\n\nHOPE. Why, my brother?  Sleep is sweet to the labouring man; we\nmay be refreshed if we take a nap.\n\nCHR. Do you not remember that one of the Shepherds bid us beware\nof the Enchanted Ground?  He meant by that that we should beware\nof sleeping; \"Therefore let us not sleep, as do others, but let us\nwatch and be sober.\"  [1 Thess. 5:6]\n\n{337} HOPE. I acknowledge myself in a fault, and had I been here\nalone I had by sleeping run the danger of death.  I see it is true\nthat the wise man saith, Two are better than one.  Hitherto hath\nthy company been my mercy, and thou shalt have a good reward for\nthy labour.  [Eccl. 9:9]\n\nCHR. Now then, said Christian, to prevent drowsiness in this place,\nlet us fall into good discourse.\n\nHOPE. With all my heart, said the other.\n\nCHR. Where shall we begin?\n\nHOPE. Where God began with us.  But do you begin, if you please.\n\nCHR. I will sing you first this song:--\n\n  When saints do sleepy grow, let them come hither,\n  And hear how these two pilgrims talk together:\n  Yea, let them learn of them, in any wise,\n  Thus to keep ope their drowsy slumb'ring eyes.\n  Saints' fellowship, if it be managed well,\n  Keeps them awake, and that in spite of hell.\n\n\n{338} CHR. Then Christian began and said, I will ask you a question.\nHow came you to think at first of so doing as you do now?\n\nHOPE. Do you mean, how came I at first to look after the good of\nmy soul?\n\nCHR. Yes, that is my meaning.\n\nHOPE. I continued a great while in the delight of those things\nwhich were seen and sold at our fair; things which, I believe now,\nwould have, had I continued in them, still drowned me in perdition\nand destruction.\n\nCHR. What things are they?\n\nHopeful's life before conversion\n\nHOPE. All the treasures and riches of the world.  Also, I delighted\nmuch in rioting, revelling, drinking, swearing, lying, uncleanness,\nSabbath-breaking, and what not, that tended to destroy the soul.\nBut I found at last, by hearing and considering of things that are\ndivine, which indeed I heard of you, as also of beloved Faithful\nthat was put to death for his faith and good living in Vanity Fair,\nthat \"the end of these things is death\".  [Rom. 6:21-23] And that\nfor these things' sake \"cometh the wrath of God upon the children\nof disobedience\".  [Eph. 5:6]\n\nCHR. And did you presently fall under the power of this conviction?\n\n{339} HOPE. No, I was not willing presently to know the evil\nof sin, nor the damnation that follows upon the commission of it;\nbut endeavoured, when my mind at first began to be shaken with the\nWord, to shut mine eyes against the light thereof.\n\nCHR. But what was the cause of your carrying of it thus to the\nfirst workings of God's blessed Spirit upon you?\n\n{340} HOPE. The causes were, 1.  I was ignorant that this was the\nwork of God upon me.  I never thought that, by awakenings for sin,\nGod at first begins the conversion of a sinner.  2.  Sin was yet\nvery sweet to my flesh, and I was loath to leave it.  3.  I could\nnot tell how to part with mine old companions, their presence and\nactions were so desirable unto me.  4.  The hours in which convictions\nwere upon me were such troublesome and such heart-affrighting hours\nthat I could not bear, no not so much as the remembrance of them,\nupon my heart.\n\nCHR. Then, as it seems, sometimes you got rid of your trouble.\n\nHOPE. Yes, verily, but it would come into my mind again, and then\nI should be as bad, nay, worse, than I was before.\n\nCHR. Why, what was it that brought your sins to mind again?\n\n{341} HOPE. Many things; as,\n\n1.  If I did but meet a good man in the streets; or,\n\n2.  If I have heard any read in the Bible; or,\n\n3.  If mine head did begin to ache; or,\n\n4.  If I were told that some of my neighbours were sick; or,\n\n5.  If I heard the bell toll for some that were dead; or,\n\n6.  If I thought of dying myself; or,\n\n7.  If I heard that sudden death happened to others;\n\n8.  But especially, when I thought of myself, that I must quickly\ncome to judgment.\n\n{342} CHR. And could you at any time, with ease, get off the guilt\nof sin, when by any of these ways it came upon you?\n\nHOPE. No, not I, for then they got faster hold of my conscience;\nand then, if I did but think of going back to sin, (though my mind\nwas turned against it), it would be double torment to me.\n\nCHR. And how did you do then?\n\nHOPE. I thought I must endeavour to mend my life; for else, thought\nI, I am sure to be damned.\n\n{343} CHR. And did you endeavour to mend?\n\nHOPE. Yes; and fled from not only my sins, but sinful company too;\nand betook me to religious duties, as prayer, reading, weeping for\nsin, speaking truth to my neighbours, &c.  These things did I, with\nmany others, too much here to relate.\n\nCHR. And did you think yourself well then?\n\nHOPE. Yes, for a while; but at the last, my trouble came tumbling\nupon me again, and that over the neck of all my reformations.\n\n{344} CHR. How came that about, since you were now reformed?\n\nHOPE. There were several things brought it upon me, especially such\nsayings as these:  \"All our righteousnesses are as filthy rags.\"\n[Isa. 64:6] \"By the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.\"\n[Gal. 2:16] \"When ye shall have done all those things, say, We are\nunprofitable\", [Luke 17:10] with many more such like.  From whence\nI began to reason with myself thus:  If ALL my righteousnesses are\nfilthy rags; if, by the deeds of the law, NO man can be justified;\nand if, when we have done ALL, we are yet unprofitable, then it\nis but a folly to think of heaven by the law.  I further thought\nthus:  If a man runs a hundred pounds into the shopkeeper's debt,\nand after that shall pay for all that he shall fetch; yet, if this\nold debt stands still in the book uncrossed, for that the shopkeeper\nmay sue him, and cast him into prison till he shall pay the debt.\n\nCHR. Well, and how did you apply this to yourself?\n\nHOPE. Why; I thought thus with myself.  I have, by my sins, run a\ngreat way into God's book, and that my now reforming will not pay\noff that score; therefore I should think still, under all my present\namendments, But how shall I be freed from that damnation that I\nhave brought myself in danger of by my former transgressions?\n\n{345} CHR. A very good application:  but, pray, go on.\n\nHOPE. Another thing that hath troubled me, even since my late\namendments, is, that if I look narrowly into the best of what I do\nnow, I still see sin, new sin, mixing itself with the best of that\nI do; so that now I am forced to conclude, that notwithstanding\nmy former fond conceits of myself and duties, I have committed sin\nenough in one duty to send me to hell, though my former life had\nbeen faultless.\n\nCHR. And what did you do then?\n\n{346} HOPE. Do!  I could not tell what to do, until I brake my\nmind to Faithful, for he and I were well acquainted.  And he told\nme, that unless I could obtain the righteousness of a man that\nnever had sinned, neither mine own, nor all the righteousness of\nthe world could save me.\n\nCHR. And did you think he spake true?\n\nHOPE. Had he told me so when I was pleased and satisfied with mine\nown amendment, I had called him fool for his pains; but now, since\nI see mine own infirmity, and the sin that cleaves to my best\nperformance, I have been forced to be of his opinion.\n\n{347} CHR. But did you think, when at first he suggested it to you,\nthat there was such a man to be found, of whom it might justly be\nsaid that he never committed sin?\n\nHOPE. I must confess the words at first sounded strangely, but\nafter a little more talk and company with him, I had full conviction\nabout it.\n\nCHR. And did you ask him what man this was, and how you must be\njustified by him?\n\nHOPE. Yes, and he told me it was the Lord Jesus, that dwelleth on\nthe right hand of the Most High.  And thus, said he, you must be\njustified by him, even by trusting to what he hath done by himself,\nin the days of his flesh, and suffered when he did hang on the\ntree.  I asked him further, how that man's righteousness could be\nof that efficacy to justify another before God?  And he told me he\nwas the mighty God, and did what he did, and died the death also,\nnot for himself, but for me; to whom his doings, and the worthiness\nof them, should be imputed, if I believed on him.  [Heb. 10,\nRom. 6, Col.  1, 1 Pet. 1]\n\n{348} CHR. And what did you do then?\n\nHOPE. I made my objections against my believing, for that I thought\nhe was not willing to save me.\n\nCHR. And what said Faithful to you then?\n\nHOPE. He bid me go to him and see.  Then I said it was presumption;\nbut he said, No, for I was invited to come.  [Matt. 11:28] Then\nhe gave me a book of Jesus, his inditing, to encourage me the more\nfreely to come; and he said, concerning that book, that every jot\nand tittle thereof stood firmer than heaven and earth.  [Matt.\n24:35] Then I asked him, What I must do when I came; and he told\nme, I must entreat upon my knees, with all my heart and soul, the\nFather to reveal him to me.  [Ps. 95:6, Dan.  6:10, Jer. 29:12,13]\nThen I asked him further, how I must make my supplication to him?\nAnd he said, Go, and thou shalt find him upon a mercy-seat, where\nhe sits all the year long, to give pardon and forgiveness to them\nthat come.  I told him that I knew not what to say when I came.\nAnd he bid me say to this effect:  God be merciful to me a sinner,\nand make me to know and believe in Jesus Christ; for I see, that\nif his righteousness had not been, or I have not faith in that\nrighteousness, I am utterly cast away.  Lord, I have heard that thou\nart a merciful God, and hast ordained that thy Son Jesus Christ\nshould be the Saviour of the world; and moreover, that thou art\nwilling to bestow him upon such a poor sinner as I am, (and I am a\nsinner indeed); Lord, take therefore this opportunity and magnify\nthy grace in the salvation of my soul, through thy Son Jesus Christ.\nAmen.  [Exo. 25:22, Lev. 16:2, Num. 7:89, Heb. 4:16]\n\n{349} CHR. And did you do as you were bidden?\n\nHOPE. Yes; over, and over, and over.\n\nCHR. And did the Father reveal his Son to you?\n\nHOPE. Not at the first, nor second, nor third, nor fourth, nor\nfifth; no, nor at the sixth time neither.\n\nCHR. What did you do then?\n\nHOPE. What!  why I could not tell what to do.\n\nCHR. Had you not thoughts of leaving off praying?\n\nHOPE. Yes; an hundred times twice told.\n\nCHR. And what was the reason you did not?\n\nHOPE. I believed that that was true which had been told me, to\nwit, that without the righteousness of this Christ, all the world\ncould not save me; and therefore, thought I with myself, if I leave\noff I die, and I can but die at the throne of grace.  And withal,\nthis came into my mind, \"Though it tarry, wait for it; because it\nwill surely come, it will not tarry.\"  [Heb. 2:3] So I continued\npraying until the Father showed me his Son.\n\n{350} CHR. And how was he revealed unto you?\n\nHOPE. I did not see him with my bodily eyes, but with the eyes of\nmy understanding; [Eph. 1:18,19] and thus it was:  One day I was\nvery sad, I think sadder than at any one time in my life, and this\nsadness was through a fresh sight of the greatness and vileness of\nmy sins.  And as I was then looking for nothing but hell, and the\neverlasting damnation of my soul, suddenly, as I thought, I saw\nthe Lord Jesus Christ look down from heaven upon me, and saying,\n\"Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.\"  [Acts\n16:30,31]\n\n{351} But I replied, Lord, I am a great, a very great sinner.  And\nhe answered, \"My grace is sufficient for thee.\"  [2 Cor.12:9] Then\nI said, But, Lord, what is believing?  And then I saw from that\nsaying, \"He that cometh to me shall never hunger, and he that\nbelieveth on me shall never thirst\", that believing and coming was\nall one; and that he that came, that is, ran out in his heart and\naffections after salvation by Christ, he indeed believed in Christ.\n[John 6:35] Then the water stood in mine eyes, and I asked further.\nBut, Lord, may such a great sinner as I am be indeed accepted of\nthee, and be saved by thee?  And I heard him say, \"And him that\ncometh to me, I will in no wise cast out.\"  [John 6:37] Then I said,\nBut how, Lord, must I consider of thee in my coming to thee, that\nmy faith may be placed aright upon thee?  Then he said, \"Christ\nJesus came into the world to save sinners.\"  [1 Tim. 1:15] \"He is\nthe end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.\"\n[Rom. 10:4] \"He died for our sins, and rose again for our\njustification.\"  [Rom. 4:25] \"He loved us, and washed us from our\nsins in his own blood.\"  [Rev. 1:5] \"He is mediator betwixt God\nand us.\"  [1 Tim. 2:5] \"He ever liveth to make intercession for\nus.\"  [Heb. 7:24,25] From all which I gathered, that I must look\nfor righteousness in his person, and for satisfaction for my sins\nby his blood; that what he did in obedience to his Father's law,\nand in submitting to the penalty thereof, was not for himself, but\nfor him that will accept it for his salvation, and be thankful.\nAnd now was my heart full of joy, mine eyes full of tears, and mine\naffections running over with love to the name, people, and ways of\nJesus Christ.\n\n{352} CHR. This was a revelation of Christ to your soul indeed;\nbut tell me particularly what effect this had upon your spirit.\n\nHOPE. It made me see that all the world, notwithstanding all the\nrighteousness thereof, is in a state of condemnation.  It made me\nsee that God the Father, though he be just, can justly justify the\ncoming sinner.  It made me greatly ashamed of the vileness of my\nformer life, and confounded me with the sense of mine own ignorance;\nfor there never came thought into my heart before now that showed\nme so the beauty of Jesus Christ.  It made me love a holy life,\nand long to do something for the honour and glory of the name of\nthe Lord Jesus; yea, I thought that had I now a thousand gallons\nof blood in my body, I could spill it all for the sake of the Lord\nJesus.\n\n{353} I saw then in my dream that Hopeful looked back and saw\nIgnorance, whom they had left behind, coming after.  Look, said he\nto Christian, how far yonder youngster loitereth behind.\n\nCHR. Ay, ay, I see him; he careth not for our company.\n\nHOPE. But I trow it would not have hurt him had he kept pace with\nus hitherto.\n\nCHR. That is true; but I warrant you he thinketh otherwise.\n\nHOPE. That, I think, he doth; but, however, let us tarry for him.\nSo they did.\n\n{354} Then Christian said to him, Come away, man, why do you stay\nso behind?\n\nIGNOR. I take my pleasure in walking alone, even more a great deal\nthan in company, unless I like it the better.\n\nThen said Christian to Hopeful, (but softly), Did I not tell you\nhe cared not for our company?  But, however, said he, come up, and\nlet us talk away the time in this solitary place.  Then directing\nhis speech to Ignorance, he said, Come, how do you?  How stands it\nbetween God and your soul now?\n\n{355} Ignorance's hope, and the ground of it\n\nIGNOR. I hope well; for I am always full of good motions, that come\ninto my mind, to comfort me as I walk.\n\nCHR. What good motions?  pray, tell us.\n\nIGNOR. Why, I think of God and heaven.\n\nCHR. So do the devils and damned souls.\n\nIGNOR. But I think of them and desire them.\n\nCHR. So do many that are never like to come there.  \"The soul of\nthe sluggard desireth, and hath nothing.\"  [Prov. 13:4]\n\nIGNOR. But I think of them, and leave all for them.\n\nCHR. That I doubt; for leaving all is a hard matter:  yea, a harder\nmatter than many are aware of.  But why, or by what, art thou\npersuaded that thou hast left all for God and heaven.\n\n{356} IGNOR. My heart tells me so.\n\nCHR. The wise man says, \"He that trusts his own heart is a fool.\"\n[Prov. 28:26]\n\nIGNOR. This is spoken of an evil heart, but mine is a good one.\n\nCHR. But how dost thou prove that?\n\nIGNOR. It comforts me in hopes of heaven.\n\nCHR. That may be through its deceitfulness; for a man's heart may\nminister comfort to him in the hopes of that thing for which he\nyet has no ground to hope.\n\nIGNOR. But my heart and life agree together, and therefore my hope\nis well grounded.\n\nCHR. Who told thee that thy heart and life agree together?\n\nIGNOR. My heart tells me so.\n\nCHR. Ask my fellow if I be a thief!  Thy heart tells thee so!  Except\nthe Word of God beareth witness in this matter, other testimony is\nof no value.\n\n{357} IGNOR. But is it not a good heart that hath good thoughts?\nand is not that a good life that is according to God's commandments?\n\nCHR. Yes, that is a good heart that hath good thoughts, and that\nis a good life that is according to God's commandments; but it is\none thing, indeed, to have these, and another thing only to think\nso.\n\nIGNOR. Pray, what count you good thoughts, and a life according to\nGod's commandments?\n\nCHR. There are good thoughts of divers kinds; some respecting\nourselves, some God, some Christ, and some other things.\n\nIGNOR. What be good thoughts respecting ourselves?\n\nCHR. Such as agree with the Word of God.\n\n{358} IGNOR. When do our thoughts of ourselves agree with the Word\nof God?\n\nCHR. When we pass the same judgment upon ourselves which the Word\npasses.  To explain myself--the Word of God saith of persons in\na natural condition, \"There is none righteous, there is none that\ndoeth good.\"  [Rom. 3] It saith also, that \"every imagination of\nthe heart of man is only evil, and that continually.\"  [Gen. 6:5]\nAnd again, \"The imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth.\"\n[Rom. 8:21] Now then, when we think thus of ourselves, having\nsense thereof, then are our thoughts good ones, because according\nto the Word of God.\n\nIGNOR. I will never believe that my heart is thus bad.\n\nCHR. Therefore thou never hadst one good thought concerning thyself\nin thy life.  But let me go on.  As the Word passeth a judgment\nupon our heart, so it passeth a judgment upon our ways; and when\nOUR thoughts of our hearts and ways agree with the judgment which\nthe Word giveth of both, then are both good, because agreeing\nthereto.\n\n{359} IGNOR. Make out your meaning.\n\nCHR. Why, the Word of God saith that man's ways are crooked ways;\nnot good, but perverse.  [Ps. 125:5, Prov. 2:15] It saith they\nare naturally out of the good way, that they have not known it.\n[Rom. 3] Now, when a man thus thinketh of his ways,--I say, when\nhe doth sensibly, and with heart-humiliation, thus think, then hath\nhe good thoughts of his own ways, because his thoughts now agree\nwith the judgment of the Word of God.\n\n{360} IGNOR. What are good thoughts concerning God?\n\nCHR. Even as I have said concerning ourselves, when our thoughts\nof God do agree with what the Word saith of him; and that is, when\nwe think of his being and attributes as the Word hath taught, of\nwhich I cannot now discourse at large; but to speak of him with\nreference to us:  Then we have right thoughts of God, when we\nthink that he knows us better than we know ourselves, and can see\nsin in us when and where we can see none in ourselves; when we\nthink he knows our inmost thoughts, and that our heart, with all\nits depths, is always open unto his eyes; also, when we think that\nall our righteousness stinks in his nostrils, and that, therefore,\nhe cannot abide to see us stand before him in any confidence, even\nin all our best performances.\n\n{361} IGNOR. Do you think that I am such a fool as to think God can\nsee no further than I? or, that I would come to God in the best of\nmy performances?\n\nCHR. Why, how dost thou think in this matter?\n\nIGNOR. Why, to be short, I think I must believe in Christ for\njustification.\n\nCHR. How!  think thou must believe in Christ, when thou seest\nnot thy need of him!  Thou neither seest thy original nor actual\ninfirmities; but hast such an opinion of thyself, and of what\nthou dost, as plainly renders thee to be one that did never see a\nnecessity of Christ's personal righteousness to justify thee before\nGod.  How, then, dost thou say, I believe in Christ?\n\n{362} IGNOR. I believe well enough for all that.\n\nCHR. How dost thou believe?\n\nIGNOR. I believe that Christ died for sinners, and that I shall be\njustified before God from the curse, through his gracious acceptance\nof my obedience to his law.  Or thus, Christ makes my duties, that\nare religious, acceptable to his Father, by virtue of his merits;\nand so shall I be justified.\n\n{363} CHR. Let me give an answer to this confession of thy faith:--\n\n1.  Thou believest with a fantastical faith; for this faith is\nnowhere described in the Word.\n\n2.  Thou believest with a false faith; because it taketh justification\nfrom the personal righteousness of Christ, and applies it to thy\nown.\n\n3.  This faith maketh not Christ a justifier of thy person, but\nof thy actions; and of thy person for thy actions' sake, which is\nfalse.\n\n4.  Therefore, this faith is deceitful, even such as will leave\nthee under wrath, in the day of God Almighty; for true justifying\nfaith puts the soul, as sensible of its condition by the law, upon\nflying for refuge unto Christ's righteousness, which righteousness\nof his is not an act of grace, by which he maketh for justification,\nthy obedience accepted with God; but his personal obedience to the\nlaw, in doing and suffering for us what that required at our hands;\nthis righteousness, I say, true faith accepteth; under the skirt\nof which, the soul being shrouded, and by it presented as spotless\nbefore God, it is accepted, and acquit from condemnation.\n\n{364} IGNOR. What!  would you have us trust to what Christ, in his\nown person, has done without us?  This conceit would loosen the\nreins of our lust, and tolerate us to live as we list; for what\nmatter how we live, if we may be justified by Christ's personal\nrighteousness from all, when we believe it?\n\nCHR. Ignorance is thy name, and as thy name is, so art thou; even\nthis thy answer demonstrateth what I say.  Ignorant thou art of\nwhat justifying righteousness is, and as ignorant how to secure thy\nsoul, through the faith of it, from the heavy wrath of God.  Yea,\nthou also art ignorant of the true effects of saving faith in this\nrighteousness of Christ, which is, to bow and win over the heart\nto God in Christ, to love his name, his word, ways, and people,\nand not as thou ignorantly imaginest.\n\nHOPE. Ask him if ever he had Christ revealed to him from heaven.\n\n{365} IGNOR. What!  you are a man for revelations!  I believe that\nwhat both you, and all the rest of you, say about that matter, is\nbut the fruit of distracted brains.\n\nHOPE. Why, man!  Christ is so hid in God from the natural apprehensions\nof the flesh, that he cannot by any man be savingly known, unless\nGod the Father reveals him to them.\n\n{366} IGNOR. That is your faith, but not mine; yet mine, I doubt\nnot, is as good as yours, though I have not in my head so many\nwhimsies as you.\n\nCHR. Give me leave to put in a word.  You ought not so slightly\nto speak of this matter; for this I will boldly affirm, even as my\ngood companion hath done, that no man can know Jesus Christ but by\nthe revelation of the Father; [Matt. 11:27] yea, and faith too,\nby which the soul layeth hold upon Christ, if it be right, must be\nwrought by the exceeding greatness of his mighty power; the working\nof which faith, I perceive, poor Ignorance, thou art ignorant of.\n[1 Cor. 12:3, Eph.  1:18,19] Be awakened, then, see thine own\nwretchedness, and fly to the Lord Jesus; and by his righteousness,\nwhich is the righteousness of God, for he himself is God, thou\nshalt be delivered from condemnation.\n\n{367} IGNOR. You go so fast, I cannot keep pace with you.  Do you\ngo on before; I must stay a while behind.\n\nThen they said--\n\n  Well, Ignorance, wilt thou yet foolish be,\n  To slight good counsel, ten times given thee?\n  And if thou yet refuse it, thou shalt know,\n  Ere long, the evil of thy doing so.\n  Remember, man, in time, stoop, do not fear;\n  Good counsel taken well, saves:  therefore hear.\n  But if thou yet shalt slight it, thou wilt be\n  The loser, (Ignorance), I'll warrant thee.\n\n\nThen Christian addressed thus himself to his fellow:--\n\nCHR. Well, come, my good Hopeful, I perceive that thou and I must\nwalk by ourselves again.\n\n{368} So I saw in my dream that they went on apace before,\nand Ignorance he came hobbling after.  Then said Christian to his\ncompanion, It pities me much for this poor man, it will certainly\ngo ill with him at last.\n\nHOPE. Alas!  there are abundance in our town in his condition,\nwhole families, yea, whole streets, and that of pilgrims too; and\nif there be so many in our parts, how many, think you, must there\nbe in the place where he was born?\n\nCHR. Indeed the Word saith, \"He hath blinded their eyes, lest they\nshould see\", &c.  But now we are by ourselves, what do you think\nof such men?  Have they at no time, think you, convictions of sin,\nand so consequently fears that their state is dangerous?\n\nHOPE. Nay, do you answer that question yourself, for you are the\nelder man.\n\nCHR. Then I say, sometimes (as I think) they may; but they being\nnaturally ignorant, understand not that such convictions tend to\ntheir good; and therefore they do desperately seek to stifle them,\nand presumptuously continue to flatter themselves in the way of\ntheir own hearts.\n\n{369} HOPE. I do believe, as you say, that fear tends much to men's\ngood, and to make them right, at their beginning to go on pilgrimage.\n\nCHR. Without all doubt it doth, if it be right; for so says the\nWord, \"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.\"  [Prov.\n1:7, 9:10, Job 28:28, Ps. 111:10]\n\n{370} HOPE. How will you describe right fear?\n\nCHR. True or right fear is discovered by three things:--\n\n1.  By its rise; it is caused by saving convictions for sin.\n\n2.  It driveth the soul to lay fast hold of Christ for salvation.\n\n3.  It begetteth and continueth in the soul a great reverence of\nGod, his Word, and ways, keeping it tender, and making it afraid\nto turn from them, to the right hand or to the left, to anything\nthat may dishonour God, break its peace, grieve the Spirit, or\ncause the enemy to speak reproachfully.\n\nHOPE. Well said; I believe you have said the truth.  Are we now\nalmost got past the Enchanted Ground?\n\nCHR. Why, art thou weary of this discourse?\n\nHOPE. No, verily, but that I would know where we are.\n\n{371} CHR. We have not now above two miles further to go thereon.\nBut let us return to our matter.  Now the ignorant know not that\nsuch convictions as tend to put them in fear are for their good,\nand therefore they seek to stifle them.\n\nHOPE. How do they seek to stifle them?\n\n{372} CHR. 1.  They think that those fears are wrought by the\ndevil, (though indeed they are wrought of God); and, thinking so,\nthey resist them as things that directly tend to their overthrow.\n\n2.  They also think that these fears tend to the spoiling of their\nfaith, when, alas, for them, poor men that they are, they have none\nat all!  and therefore they harden their hearts against them.\n\n3.  They presume they ought not to fear; and, therefore, in despite\nof them, wax presumptuously confident.\n\n4.  They see that those fears tend to take away from them their\npitiful old self-holiness, and therefore they resist them with all\ntheir might.\n\n{373} HOPE. I know something of this myself; for, before I knew\nmyself, it was so with me.\n\nCHR. Well, we will leave, at this time, our neighbour Ignorance by\nhimself, and fall upon another profitable question.\n\nHOPE. With all my heart, but you shall still begin.\n\nCHR. Well then, did you not know, about ten years ago, one Temporary\nin your parts, who was a forward man in religion then?\n\nHOPE. Know him!  yes, he dwelt in Graceless, a town about two miles\noff of Honesty, and he dwelt next door to one Turnback.\n\n{374} CHR. Right, he dwelt under the same roof with him.  Well,\nthat man was much awakened once; I believe that then he had some\nsight of his sins, and of the wages that were due thereto.\n\nHOPE. I am of your mind, for, my house not being above three miles\nfrom him, he would ofttimes come to me, and that with many tears.\nTruly I pitied the man, and was not altogether without hope of him;\nbut one may see, it is not every one that cries, Lord, Lord.\n\nCHR. He told me once that he was resolved to go on pilgrimage, as\nwe do now; but all of a sudden he grew acquainted with one Save-self,\nand then he became a stranger to me.\n\n{375} HOPE. Now, since we are talking about him, let us a little\ninquire into the reason of the sudden backsliding of him and such\nothers.\n\nCHR. It may be very profitable, but do you begin.\n\nHOPE. Well, then, there are in my judgment four reasons for it:--\n\n{376} 1.  Though the consciences of such men are awakened, yet their\nminds are not changed; therefore, when the power of guilt weareth\naway, that which provoked them to be religious ceaseth, wherefore\nthey naturally turn to their own course again, even as we see the\ndog that is sick of what he has eaten, so long as his sickness\nprevails he vomits and casts up all; not that he doth this of a\nfree mind (if we may say a dog has a mind), but because it troubleth\nhis stomach; but now, when his sickness is over, and so his stomach\neased, his desire being not at all alienate from his vomit, he turns\nhim about and licks up all, and so it is true which is written,\n\"The dog is turned to his own vomit again.\"  [2 Pet. 2:22] Thus\nI say, being hot for heaven, by virtue only of the sense and fear\nof the torments of hell, as their sense of hell and the fears of\ndamnation chills and cools, so their desires for heaven and salvation\ncool also.  So then it comes to pass, that when their guilt and\nfear is gone, their desires for heaven and happiness die, and they\nreturn to their course again.\n\n{377} 2.  Another reason is, they have slavish fears that do\novermaster them; I speak now of the fears that they have of men,\nfor \"the fear of man bringeth a snare\".  [Prov. 29:25] So then,\nthough they seem to be hot for heaven, so long as the flames of\nhell are about their ears, yet when that terror is a little over,\nthey betake themselves to second thoughts; namely, that it is good\nto be wise, and not to run (for they know not what) the hazard of\nlosing all, or, at least, of bringing themselves into unavoidable\nand unnecessary troubles, and so they fall in with the world again.\n\n{378} 3.  The shame that attends religion lies also as a block in\ntheir way; they are proud and haughty; and religion in their eye\nis low and contemptible, therefore, when they have lost their sense\nof hell and wrath to come, they return again to their former course.\n\n{379} 4.  Guilt, and to meditate terror, are grievous to them.\nThey like not to see their misery before they come into it; though\nperhaps the sight of it first, if they loved that sight, might make\nthem fly whither the righteous fly and are safe.  But because they\ndo, as I hinted before, even shun the thoughts of guilt and terror,\ntherefore, when once they are rid of their awakenings about the\nterrors and wrath of God, they harden their hearts gladly, and\nchoose such ways as will harden them more and more.\n\n{380} CHR. You are pretty near the business, for the bottom of all\nis for want of a change in their mind and will.  And therefore they\nare but like the felon that standeth before the judge, he quakes\nand trembles, and seems to repent most heartily, but the bottom\nof all is the fear of the halter; not that he hath any detestation\nof the offence, as is evident, because, let but this man have his\nliberty, and he will be a thief, and so a rogue still, whereas, if\nhis mind was changed, he would be otherwise.\n\n{381} HOPE. Now I have showed you the reasons of their going back,\ndo you show me the manner thereof.\n\nCHR. So I will willingly.\n\n1.  They draw off their thoughts, all that they may, from the\nremembrance of God, death, and judgment to come.\n\n2.  Then they cast off by degrees private duties, as closet prayer,\ncurbing their lusts, watching, sorrow for sin, and the like.\n\n3.  Then they shun the company of lively and warm Christians.\n\n4.  After that they grow cold to public duty, as hearing, reading,\ngodly conference, and the like.\n\n5.  Then they begin to pick holes, as we say, in the coats of some\nof the godly; and that devilishly, that they may have a seeming\ncolour to throw religion (for the sake of some infirmity they have\nespied in them) behind their backs.\n\n6.  Then they begin to adhere to, and associate themselves with,\ncarnal, loose, and wanton men.\n\n7.  Then they give way to carnal and wanton discourses in secret;\nand glad are they if they can see such things in any that are\ncounted honest, that they may the more boldly do it through their\nexample.\n\n8.  After this they begin to play with little sins openly.\n\n9.  And then, being hardened, they show themselves as they are.  Thus,\nbeing launched again into the gulf of misery, unless a miracle of\ngrace prevent it, they everlastingly perish in their own deceivings.\n\n{382} Now I saw in my dream, that by this time the Pilgrims were\ngot over the Enchanted Ground, and entering into the country of\nBeulah, whose air was very sweet and pleasant, the way lying directly\nthrough it, they solaced themselves there for a season.  Yea, here\nthey heard continually the singing of birds, and saw every day the\nflowers appear on the earth, and heard the voice of the turtle in\nthe land.  [Isa. 62:4, Song of Solomon 2:10-12] In this country\nthe sun shineth night and day; wherefore this was beyond the Valley\nof the Shadow of Death, and also out of the reach of Giant Despair,\nneither could they from this place so much as see Doubting Castle.\nHere they were within sight of the city they were going to, also\nhere met them some of the inhabitants thereof; for in this land\nthe Shining Ones commonly walked, because it was upon the borders\nof heaven.  In this land also, the contract between the bride and\nthe bridegroom was renewed; yea, here, \"As the bridegroom rejoiceth\nover the bride, so did their God rejoice over them.\"  [Isa. 62:5]\nHere they had no want of corn and wine; for in this place they met\nwith abundance of what they had sought for in all their pilgrimage.\n[Isa. 62:8] Here they heard voices from out of the city, loud voices,\nsaying, \"'Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation\ncometh!  Behold, his reward is with him!'  Here all the inhabitants\nof the country called them, 'The holy people, The redeemed of the\nLord, Sought out'\", etc.  [Isa. 62:11,12]\n\n{383} Now as they walked in this land, they had more rejoicing than\nin parts more remote from the kingdom to which they were bound; and\ndrawing near to the city, they had yet a more perfect view thereof.\nIt was builded of pearls and precious stones, also the street thereof\nwas paved with gold; so that by reason of the natural glory of the\ncity, and the reflection of the sunbeams upon it, Christian with\ndesire fell sick; Hopeful also had a fit or two of the same disease.\nWherefore, here they lay by it a while, crying out, because of their\npangs, If ye find my beloved, tell him that I am sick of love.\n\n{384} But, being a little strengthened, and better able to bear\ntheir sickness, they walked on their way, and came yet nearer and\nnearer, where were orchards, vineyards, and gardens, and their gates\nopened into the highway.  Now, as they came up to these places,\nbehold the gardener stood in the way, to whom the Pilgrims said,\nWhose goodly vineyards and gardens are these?  He answered, They are\nthe King's, and are planted here for his own delight, and also for\nthe solace of pilgrims.  So the gardener had them into the vineyards,\nand bid them refresh themselves with the dainties.  [Deut. 23:24]\nHe also showed them there the King's walks, and the arbours where\nhe delighted to be; and here they tarried and slept.\n\n{385} Now I beheld in my dream that they talked more in their sleep\nat this time than ever they did in all their journey; and being in\na muse thereabout, the gardener said even to me, Wherefore musest\nthou at the matter?  It is the nature of the fruit of the grapes\nof these vineyards to go down so sweetly as to cause the lips of\nthem that are asleep to speak.\n\n{386} So I saw that when they awoke, they addressed themselves to\ngo up to the city; but, as I said, the reflection of the sun upon\nthe city (for the city was pure gold) was so extremely glorious\nthat they could not, as yet, with open face behold it, but through\nan instrument made for that purpose.  So I saw, that as I went\non, there met them two men, in raiment that shone like gold; also\ntheir faces shone as the light.  [Rev. 21:18, 2 Cor. 3:18]\n\n{387} These men asked the Pilgrims whence they came; and they told\nthem.  They also asked them where they had lodged, what difficulties\nand dangers, what comforts and pleasures they had met in the way;\nand they told them.  Then said the men that met them, You have but\ntwo difficulties more to meet with, and then you are in the city.\n\n{388} Christian then, and his companion, asked the men to go along\nwith them; so they told them they would.  But, said they, you must\nobtain it by your own faith.  So I saw in my dream that they went\non together, until they came in sight of the gate.\n\n{389} Now, I further saw, that betwixt them and the gate was a river,\nbut there was no bridge to go over:  the river was very deep.  At\nthe sight, therefore, of this river, the Pilgrims were much stunned;\nbut the men that went in with them said, You must go through, or\nyou cannot come at the gate.\n\n{390} The Pilgrims then began to inquire if there was no other\nway to the gate; to which they answered, Yes; but there hath not\nany, save two, to wit, Enoch and Elijah, been permitted to tread\nthat path since the foundation of the world, nor shall, until the\nlast trumpet shall sound.  [1 Cor. 15:51,52] The Pilgrims then,\nespecially Christian, began to despond in their minds, and looked\nthis way and that, but no way could be found by them by which they\nmight escape the river.  Then they asked the men if the waters were\nall of a depth.  They said:  No; yet they could not help them in\nthat case; for, said they, you shall find it deeper or shallower\nas you believe in the King of the place.\n\n*In the Resurrection of the Righteous.  [Rev. 20:4-6]\n\n{391} They then addressed themselves to the water and, entering,\nChristian began to sink, and crying out to his good friend Hopeful,\nhe said, I sink in deep waters; the billows go over my head, all\nhis waves go over me!  Selah.\n\n{392} Christian's conflict at the hour of death\n\nThen said the other, Be of good cheer, my brother, I feel the\nbottom, and it is good.  Then said Christian, Ah!  my friend, the\nsorrows of death hath compassed me about; I shall not see the land\nthat flows with milk and honey; and with that a great darkness and\nhorror fell upon Christian, so that he could not see before him.\nAlso here he in great measure lost his senses, so that he could\nneither remember nor orderly talk of any of those sweet refreshments\nthat he had met with in the way of his pilgrimage.  But all the\nwords that he spake still tended to discover that he had horror of\nmind, and heart fears that he should die in that river, and never\nobtain entrance in at the gate.  Here also, as they that stood by\nperceived, he was much in the troublesome thoughts of the sins that\nhe had committed, both since and before he began to be a pilgrim.\nIt was also observed that he was troubled with apparitions of\nhobgoblins and evil spirits, for ever and anon he would intimate\nso much by words.  Hopeful, therefore, here had much ado to keep\nhis brother's head above water; yea, sometimes he would be quite\ngone down, and then, ere a while, he would rise up again half dead.\nHopeful also would endeavour to comfort him, saying, Brother, I see\nthe gate, and men standing by to receive us:  but Christian would\nanswer, It is you, it is you they wait for; you have been Hopeful\never since I knew you.  And so have you, said he to Christian.\nAh!  brother!  said he, surely if I was right he would now arise\nto help me; but for my sins he hath brought me into the snare, and\nhath left me.  Then said Hopeful, My brother, you have quite forgot\nthe text, where it is said of the wicked, \"There are no bands in\ntheir death, but their strength is firm.  They are not in trouble\nas other men, neither are they plagued like other men.  [Ps. 73:4,5]\nThese troubles and distresses that you go through in these waters\nare no sign that God hath forsaken you; but are sent to try you,\nwhether you will call to mind that which heretofore you have received\nof his goodness, and live upon him in your distresses.\n\n{393} Then I saw in my dream, that Christian was as in a muse\na while.  To whom also Hopeful added this word, Be of good cheer,\nJesus Christ maketh thee whole; and with that Christian brake out\nwith a loud voice, Oh, I see him again!  and he tells me, \"When\nthou passest through the waters, I will be with thee, and through\nthe rivers, they shall not overflow thee.\"  [Isa. 43:2] Then\nthey both took courage, and the enemy was after that as still as\na stone, until they were gone over.  Christian therefore presently\nfound ground to stand upon, and so it followed that the rest of the\nriver was but shallow.  Thus they got over.  Now, upon the bank of\nthe river, on the other side, they saw the two shining men again,\nwho there waited for them; wherefore, being come out of the river,\nthey saluted them, saying, We are ministering spirits, sent forth\nto minister for those that shall be heirs of salvation.  Thus they\nwent along towards the gate.\n\n{394} Now you must note that the city stood upon a mighty hill,\nbut the Pilgrims went up that hill with ease, because they had\nthese two men to lead them up by the arms; also, they had left their\nmortal garments behind them in the river, for though they went in\nwith them, they came out without them.  They, therefore, went up\nhere with much agility and speed, though the foundation upon which\nthe city was framed was higher than the clouds.  They therefore\nwent up through the regions of the air, sweetly talking as they\nwent, being comforted, because they safely got over the river, and\nhad such glorious companions to attend them.\n\nNow, now, look how the holy pilgrims ride, Clouds are their\nchariots, angels are their guide:  Who would not here for him all\nhazards run, That thus provides for his when this world's done?\n\n{395} The talk they had with the Shining Ones was about the glory\nof the place; who told them that the beauty and glory of it was\ninexpressible.  There, said they, is the Mount Zion, the heavenly\nJerusalem, the innumerable company of angels, and the spirits of\njust men made perfect.  [Heb. 12:22-24] You are going now, said\nthey, to the paradise of God, wherein you shall see the tree of\nlife, and eat of the never-fading fruits thereof; and when you come\nthere, you shall have white robes given you, and your walk and talk\nshall be every day with the King, even all the days of eternity.\n[Rev. 2:7, 3:4, 21:4,5] There you shall not see again such things\nas you saw when you were in the lower region upon the earth, to\nwit, sorrow, sickness, affliction, and death, for the former things\nare passed away.  You are now going to Abraham, to Isaac, and Jacob,\nand to the prophets--men that God hath taken away from the evil\nto come, and that are now resting upon their beds, each one walking\nin his righteousness.  [Isa. 57:1,2, 65:17] The men then asked,\nWhat must we do in the holy place?  To whom it was answered, You\nmust there receive the comforts of all your toil, and have joy for\nall your sorrow; you must reap what you have sown, even the fruit\nof all your prayers, and tears, and sufferings for the King by the\nway.  [Gal. 6:7] In that place you must wear crowns of gold, and\nenjoy the perpetual sight and vision of the Holy One, for there you\nshall see him as he is.  [1 John 3:2] There also you shall serve\nhim continually with praise, with shouting, and thanksgiving, whom\nyou desired to serve in the world, though with much difficulty,\nbecause of the infirmity of your flesh.  There your eyes shall\nbe delighted with seeing, and your ears with hearing the pleasant\nvoice of the Mighty One.  There you shall enjoy your friends again\nthat are gone thither before you; and there you shall with joy\nreceive, even every one that follows into the holy place after\nyou.  There also shall you be clothed with glory and majesty, and\nput into an equipage fit to ride out with the King of Glory.  When\nhe shall come with sound of trumpet in the clouds, as upon the\nwings of the wind, you shall come with him; and when he shall sit\nupon the throne of judgment; you shall sit by him; yea, and when\nhe shall pass sentence upon all the workers of iniquity, let them\nbe angels or men, you also shall have a voice in that judgment,\nbecause they were his and your enemies.  [1 Thes. 4:13-16, Jude\n1:14, Dan.  7:9,10, 1 Cor. 6:2,3] Also, when he shall again return\nto the city, you shall go too, with sound of trumpet, and be ever\nwith him.\n\n{396} Now while they were thus drawing towards the gate, behold a\ncompany of the heavenly host came out to meet them; to whom it was\nsaid, by the other two Shining Ones, These are the men that have\nloved our Lord when they were in the world, and that have left all\nfor his holy name; and he hath sent us to fetch them, and we have\nbrought them thus far on their desired journey, that they may go\nin and look their Redeemer in the face with joy.  Then the heavenly\nhost gave a great shout, saying, \"Blessed are they which are called\nunto the marriage supper of the Lamb.\"  [Rev. 19:9] There came out\nalso at this time to meet them, several of the King's trumpeters,\nclothed in white and shining raiment, who, with melodious noises,\nand loud, made even the heavens to echo with their sound.  These\ntrumpeters saluted Christian and his fellow with ten thousand\nwelcomes from the world; and this they did with shouting, and sound\nof trumpet.\n\n{397} This done, they compassed them round on every side; some went\nbefore, some behind, and some on the right hand, some on the left,\n(as it were to guard them through the upper regions), continually\nsounding as they went, with melodious noise, in notes on high:  so\nthat the very sight was, to them that could behold it, as if heaven\nitself was come down to meet them.  Thus, therefore, they walked\non together; and as they walked, ever and anon these trumpeters,\neven with joyful sound, would, by mixing their music with looks and\ngestures, still signify to Christian and his brother, how welcome\nthey were into their company, and with what gladness they came to\nmeet them; and now were these two men, as it were, in heaven, before\nthey came at it, being swallowed up with the sight of angels, and\nwith hearing of their melodious notes.  Here also they had the city\nitself in view, and they thought they heard all the bells therein\nto ring, to welcome them thereto.  But above all, the warm and\njoyful thoughts that they had about their own dwelling there, with\nsuch company, and that for ever and ever.  Oh, by what tongue or\npen can their glorious joy be expressed!  And thus they came up to\nthe gate.\n\n{398} Now, when they were come up to the gate, there was written over\nit in letters of gold, \"Blessed are they that do his commandments,\nthat they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in\nthrough the gates into the city.\"  [Rev. 22:14]\n\n{399} Then I saw in my dream that the Shining Men bid them call\nat the gate; the which, when they did, some looked from above over\nthe gate, to wit, Enoch, Moses, and Elijah, &c., to whom it was\nsaid, These pilgrims are come from the City of Destruction, for\nthe love that they bear to the King of this place; and then the\nPilgrims gave in unto them each man his certificate, which they\nhad received in the beginning; those, therefore, were carried in\nto the King, who, when he had read them, said, Where are the men?\nTo whom it was answered, They are standing without the gate.  The\nKing then commanded to open the gate, \"That the righteous nation,\"\nsaid he, \"which keepeth the truth, may enter in.\"  [Isa. 26:2]\n\n{400} Now I saw in my dream that these two men went in at the\ngate:  and lo, as they entered, they were transfigured, and they\nhad raiment put on that shone like gold.  There was also that met\nthem with harps and crowns, and gave them to them--the harps to\npraise withal, and the crowns in token of honour.  Then I heard\nin my dream that all the bells in the city rang again for joy, and\nthat it was said unto them, \"ENTER YE INTO THE JOY OF YOUR LORD.\"\nI also heard the men themselves, that they sang with a loud voice,\nsaying, \"BLESSING AND HONOUR, AND GLORY, AND POWER, BE UNTO HIM\nTHAT SITTETH UPON THE THRONE, AND UNTO THE LAMB, FOR EVER AND EVER.\"\n[Rev. 5:13]\n\n{401} Now, just as the gates were opened to let in the men,\nI looked in after them, and, behold, the City shone like the sun;\nthe streets also were paved with gold, and in them walked many\nmen, with crowns on their heads, palms in their hands, and golden\nharps to sing praises withal.\n\n{402} There were also of them that had wings, and they answered\none another without intermission, saying, \"Holy, holy, holy is the\nLord.\"  [Rev. 4:8] And after that they shut up the gates; which,\nwhen I had seen, I wished myself among them.\n\n{403} Now while I was gazing upon all these things, I turned my\nhead to look back, and saw Ignorance come up to the river side;\nbut he soon got over, and that without half that difficulty which\nthe other two men met with.  For it happened that there was then\nin that place, one Vain-hope, a ferryman, that with his boat helped\nhim over; so he, as the other I saw, did ascend the hill, to come\nup to the gate, only he came alone; neither did any man meet him\nwith the least encouragement.  When he was come up to the gate, he\nlooked up to the writing that was above, and then began to knock,\nsupposing that entrance should have been quickly administered to\nhim; but he was asked by the men that looked over the top of the\ngate, Whence came you, and what would you have?  He answered, I\nhave eat and drank in the presence of the King, and he has taught\nin our streets.  Then they asked him for his certificate, that they\nmight go in and show it to the King; so he fumbled in his bosom\nfor one, and found none.  Then said they, Have you none?  But the\nman answered never a word.  So they told the King, but he would\nnot come down to see him, but commanded the two Shining Ones that\nconducted Christian and Hopeful to the City, to go out and take\nIgnorance, and bind him hand and foot, and have him away.  Then\nthey took him up, and carried him through the air to the door that\nI saw in the side of the hill, and put him in there.  Then I saw\nthat there was a way to hell, even from the gates of heaven, as\nwell as from the City of Destruction.  So I awoke, and behold it\nwas a dream.\n\n\n\n{404} The Conclusion.\n\n\n  Now, Reader, I have told my dream to thee;\n  See if thou canst interpret it to me,\n  Or to thyself, or neighbour; but take heed\n  Of misinterpreting; for that, instead\n  Of doing good, will but thyself abuse:\n  By misinterpreting, evil ensues.\n\n  Take heed, also, that thou be not extreme,\n  In playing with the outside of my dream:\n  Nor let my figure or similitude\n  Put thee into a laughter or a feud.\n  Leave this for boys and fools; but as for thee,\n  Do thou the substance of my matter see.\n\n  Put by the curtains, look within my veil,\n  Turn up my metaphors, and do not fail,\n  There, if thou seekest them, such things to find,\n  As will be helpful to an honest mind.\n\n  What of my dross thou findest there, be bold\n  To throw away, but yet preserve the gold;\n  What if my gold be wrapped up in ore?--\n  None throws away the apple for the core.\n  But if thou shalt cast all away as vain,\n  I know not but 'twill make me dream again.",
