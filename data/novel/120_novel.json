I remember him looking round the cover and whistling to himself\nas he did so, and then breaking out in that old sea-song that he sang so\noften afterwards:\n\n          “Fifteen men on the dead man's chest--\n             Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!”\n\nin the high, old tottering voice that seemed to have been tuned and\nbroken at the capstan bars. Then he rapped on the door with a bit of\nstick like a handspike that he carried, and when my father appeared,\ncalled roughly for a glass of rum. This, when it was brought to him,\nhe drank slowly, like a connoisseur, lingering on the taste and still\nlooking about him at the cliffs and up at our signboard.\n\n“This is a handy cove,” says he at length; “and a pleasant sittyated\ngrog-shop. Much company, mate?”\n\nMy father told him no, very little company, the more was the pity.\n\n“Well, then,” said he, “this is the berth for me. Here you, matey,” he\ncried to the man who trundled the barrow; “bring up alongside and help\nup my chest. I'll stay here a bit,” he continued. “I'm a plain man; rum\nand bacon and eggs is what I want, and that head up there for to watch\nships off. What you mought call me? You mought call me captain. Oh, I\nsee what you're at--there”; and he threw down three or four gold pieces\non the threshold. “You can tell me when I've worked through that,” says\nhe, looking as fierce as a commander.\n\nAnd indeed bad as his clothes were and coarsely as he spoke, he had none\nof the appearance of a man who sailed before the mast, but seemed like\na mate or skipper accustomed to be obeyed or to strike. The man who came\nwith the barrow told us the mail had set him down the morning before at\nthe Royal George, that he had inquired what inns there were along the\ncoast, and hearing ours well spoken of, I suppose, and described as\nlonely, had chosen it from the others for his place of residence. And\nthat was all we could learn of our guest.\n\nHe was a very silent man by custom. All day he hung round the cove or\nupon the cliffs with a brass telescope; all evening he sat in a corner\nof the parlour next the fire and drank rum and water very strong. Mostly\nhe would not speak when spoken to, only look up sudden and fierce and\nblow through his nose like a fog-horn; and we and the people who came\nabout our house soon learned to let him be. Every day when he came back\nfrom his stroll he would ask if any seafaring men had gone by along the\nroad. At first we thought it was the want of company of his own kind\nthat made him ask this question, but at last we began to see he was\ndesirous to avoid them. When a seaman did put up at the Admiral Benbow\n(as now and then some did, making by the coast road for Bristol) he\nwould look in at him through the curtained door before he entered the\nparlour; and he was always sure to be as silent as a mouse when any such\nwas present. For me, at least, there was no secret about the matter, for\nI was, in a way, a sharer in his alarms. He had taken me aside one day\nand promised me a silver fourpenny on the first of every month if I\nwould only keep my “weather-eye open for a seafaring man with one leg”\n and let him know the moment he appeared. Often enough when the first\nof the month came round and I applied to him for my wage, he would only\nblow through his nose at me and stare me down, but before the week was\nout he was sure to think better of it, bring me my four-penny piece, and\nrepeat his orders to look out for “the seafaring man with one leg.”\n\nHow that personage haunted my dreams, I need scarcely tell you. On\nstormy nights, when the wind shook the four corners of the house and\nthe surf roared along the cove and up the cliffs, I would see him in a\nthousand forms, and with a thousand diabolical expressions. Now the leg\nwould be cut off at the knee, now at the hip; now he was a monstrous\nkind of a creature who had never had but the one leg, and that in the\nmiddle of his body. To see him leap and run and pursue me over hedge and\nditch was the worst of nightmares. And altogether I paid pretty dear for\nmy monthly fourpenny piece, in the shape of these abominable fancies.\n\nBut though I was so terrified by the idea of the seafaring man with one\nleg, I was far less afraid of the captain himself than anybody else who\nknew him. There were nights when he took a deal more rum and water\nthan his head would carry; and then he would sometimes sit and sing his\nwicked, old, wild sea-songs, minding nobody; but sometimes he would call\nfor glasses round and force all the trembling company to listen to his\nstories or bear a chorus to his singing. Often I have heard the house\nshaking with “Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum,” all the neighbours joining\nin for dear life, with the fear of death upon them, and each singing\nlouder than the other to avoid remark. For in these fits he was the most\noverriding companion ever known; he would slap his hand on the table for\nsilence all round; he would fly up in a passion of anger at a question,\nor sometimes because none was put, and so he judged the company was not\nfollowing his story. Nor would he allow anyone to leave the inn till he\nhad drunk himself sleepy and reeled off to bed.\n\nHis stories were what frightened people worst of all. Dreadful stories\nthey were--about hanging, and walking the plank, and storms at sea, and\nthe Dry Tortugas, and wild deeds and places on the Spanish Main. By his\nown account he must have lived his life among some of the wickedest men\nthat God ever allowed upon the sea, and the language in which he told\nthese stories shocked our plain country people almost as much as the\ncrimes that he described. My father was always saying the inn would be\nruined, for people would soon cease coming there to be tyrannized over\nand put down, and sent shivering to their beds; but I really believe his\npresence did us good. People were frightened at the time, but on looking\nback they rather liked it; it was a fine excitement in a quiet country\nlife, and there was even a party of the younger men who pretended to\nadmire him, calling him a “true sea-dog” and a “real old salt” and\nsuch like names, and saying there was the sort of man that made England\nterrible at sea.\n\nIn one way, indeed, he bade fair to ruin us, for he kept on staying week\nafter week, and at last month after month, so that all the money had\nbeen long exhausted, and still my father never plucked up the heart to\ninsist on having more. If ever he mentioned it, the captain blew through\nhis nose so loudly that you might say he roared, and stared my poor\nfather out of the room. I have seen him wringing his hands after such a\nrebuff, and I am sure the annoyance and the terror he lived in must have\ngreatly hastened his early and unhappy death.\n\nAll the time he lived with us the captain made no change whatever in his\ndress but to buy some stockings from a hawker. One of the cocks of his\nhat having fallen down, he let it hang from that day forth, though it\nwas a great annoyance when it blew. I remember the appearance of his\ncoat, which he patched himself upstairs in his room, and which, before\nthe end, was nothing but patches. He never wrote or received a letter,\nand he never spoke with any but the neighbours, and with these, for the\nmost part, only when drunk on rum. The great sea-chest none of us had\never seen open.\n\nHe was only once crossed, and that was towards the end, when my poor\nfather was far gone in a decline that took him off. Dr. Livesey came\nlate one afternoon to see the patient, took a bit of dinner from my\nmother, and went into the parlour to smoke a pipe until his horse should\ncome down from the hamlet, for we had no stabling at the old Benbow. I\nfollowed him in, and I remember observing the contrast the neat, bright\ndoctor, with his powder as white as snow and his bright, black eyes and\npleasant manners, made with the coltish country folk, and above all,\nwith that filthy, heavy, bleared scarecrow of a pirate of ours, sitting,\nfar gone in rum, with his arms on the table. Suddenly he--the captain,\nthat is--began to pipe up his eternal song:\n\n          “Fifteen men on the dead man's chest--\n             Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!\n           Drink and the devil had done for the rest--\n             Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!”\n\nAt first I had supposed “the dead man's chest” to be that identical big\nbox of his upstairs in the front room, and the thought had been mingled\nin my nightmares with that of the one-legged seafaring man. But by this\ntime we had all long ceased to pay any particular notice to the song; it\nwas new, that night, to nobody but Dr. Livesey, and on him I observed it\ndid not produce an agreeable effect, for he looked up for a moment quite\nangrily before he went on with his talk to old Taylor, the gardener, on\na new cure for the rheumatics. In the meantime, the captain gradually\nbrightened up at his own music, and at last flapped his hand upon\nthe table before him in a way we all knew to mean silence. The voices\nstopped at once, all but Dr. Livesey's; he went on as before speaking\nclear and kind and drawing briskly at his pipe between every word or\ntwo. The captain glared at him for a while, flapped his hand again,\nglared still harder, and at last broke out with a villainous, low oath,\n“Silence, there, between decks!”\n\n“Were you addressing me, sir?” says the doctor; and when the ruffian had\ntold him, with another oath, that this was so, “I have only one thing to\nsay to you, sir,” replies the doctor, “that if you keep on drinking rum,\nthe world will soon be quit of a very dirty scoundrel!”\n\nThe old fellow's fury was awful. He sprang to his feet, drew and opened\na sailor's clasp-knife, and balancing it open on the palm of his hand,\nthreatened to pin the doctor to the wall.\n\nThe doctor never so much as moved. He spoke to him as before, over his\nshoulder and in the same tone of voice, rather high, so that all the\nroom might hear, but perfectly calm and steady: “If you do not put that\nknife this instant in your pocket, I promise, upon my honour, you shall\nhang at the next assizes.”\n\nThen followed a battle of looks between them, but the captain soon\nknuckled under, put up his weapon, and resumed his seat, grumbling like\na beaten dog.\n\n“And now, sir,” continued the doctor, “since I now know there's such a\nfellow in my district, you may count I'll have an eye upon you day and\nnight. I'm not a doctor only; I'm a magistrate; and if I catch a breath\nof complaint against you, if it's only for a piece of incivility like\ntonight's, I'll take effectual means to have you hunted down and routed\nout of this. Let that suffice.”\n\nSoon after, Dr. Livesey's horse came to the door and he rode away, but\nthe captain held his peace that evening, and for many evenings to come.\n\n\n\n\n2\n\nBlack Dog Appears and Disappears\n\n\nIT was not very long after this that there occurred the first of the\nmysterious events that rid us at last of the captain, though not, as you\nwill see, of his affairs. It was a bitter cold winter, with long, hard\nfrosts and heavy gales; and it was plain from the first that my poor\nfather was little likely to see the spring. He sank daily, and my mother\nand I had all the inn upon our hands, and were kept busy enough without\npaying much regard to our unpleasant guest.\n\nIt was one January morning, very early--a pinching, frosty morning--the\ncove all grey with hoar-frost, the ripple lapping softly on the stones,\nthe sun still low and only touching the hilltops and shining far to\nseaward. The captain had risen earlier than usual and set out down the\nbeach, his cutlass swinging under the broad skirts of the old blue coat,\nhis brass telescope under his arm, his hat tilted back upon his head. I\nremember his breath hanging like smoke in his wake as he strode off, and\nthe last sound I heard of him as he turned the big rock was a loud snort\nof indignation, as though his mind was still running upon Dr. Livesey.\n\nWell, mother was upstairs with father and I was laying the\nbreakfast-table against the captain's return when the parlour door\nopened and a man stepped in on whom I had never set my eyes before. He\nwas a pale, tallowy creature, wanting two fingers of the left hand, and\nthough he wore a cutlass, he did not look much like a fighter. I\nhad always my eye open for seafaring men, with one leg or two, and I\nremember this one puzzled me. He was not sailorly, and yet he had a\nsmack of the sea about him too.\n\nI asked him what was for his service, and he said he would take rum; but\nas I was going out of the room to fetch it, he sat down upon a table\nand motioned me to draw near. I paused where I was, with my napkin in my\nhand.\n\n“Come here, sonny,” says he. “Come nearer here.”\n\nI took a step nearer.\n\n“Is this here table for my mate Bill?” he asked with a kind of leer.\n\nI told him I did not know his mate Bill, and this was for a person who\nstayed in our house whom we called the captain.\n\n“Well,” said he, “my mate Bill would be called the captain, as like\nas not. He has a cut on one cheek and a mighty pleasant way with him,\nparticularly in drink, has my mate Bill. We'll put it, for argument\nlike, that your captain has a cut on one cheek--and we'll put it, if you\nlike, that that cheek's the right one. Ah, well! I told you. Now, is my\nmate Bill in this here house?”\n\nI told him he was out walking.\n\n“Which way, sonny? Which way is he gone?”\n\nAnd when I had pointed out the rock and told him how the captain was\nlikely to return, and how soon, and answered a few other questions,\n“Ah,” said he, “this'll be as good as drink to my mate Bill.”\n\nThe expression of his face as he said these words was not at all\npleasant, and I had my own reasons for thinking that the stranger was\nmistaken, even supposing he meant what he said. But it was no affair of\nmine, I thought; and besides, it was difficult to know what to do. The\nstranger kept hanging about just inside the inn door, peering round the\ncorner like a cat waiting for a mouse. Once I stepped out myself into\nthe road, but he immediately called me back, and as I did not obey quick\nenough for his fancy, a most horrible change came over his tallowy face,\nand he ordered me in with an oath that made me jump. As soon as I\nwas back again he returned to his former manner, half fawning, half\nsneering, patted me on the shoulder, told me I was a good boy and he had\ntaken quite a fancy to me. “I have a son of my own,” said he, “as like\nyou as two blocks, and he's all the pride of my 'art. But the great\nthing for boys is discipline, sonny--discipline. Now, if you had sailed\nalong of Bill, you wouldn't have stood there to be spoke to twice--not\nyou. That was never Bill's way, nor the way of sich as sailed with him.\nAnd here, sure enough, is my mate Bill, with a spy-glass under his arm,\nbless his old 'art, to be sure. You and me'll just go back into the\nparlour, sonny, and get behind the door, and we'll give Bill a little\nsurprise--bless his 'art, I say again.”\n\nSo saying, the stranger backed along with me into the parlour and put me\nbehind him in the corner so that we were both hidden by the open door. I\nwas very uneasy and alarmed, as you may fancy, and it rather added to my\nfears to observe that the stranger was certainly frightened himself. He\ncleared the hilt of his cutlass and loosened the blade in the sheath;\nand all the time we were waiting there he kept swallowing as if he felt\nwhat we used to call a lump in the throat.\n\nAt last in strode the captain, slammed the door behind him, without\nlooking to the right or left, and marched straight across the room to\nwhere his breakfast awaited him.\n\n“Bill,” said the stranger in a voice that I thought he had tried to make\nbold and big.\n\nThe captain spun round on his heel and fronted us; all the brown had\ngone out of his face, and even his nose was blue; he had the look of a\nman who sees a ghost, or the evil one, or something worse, if anything\ncan be; and upon my word, I felt sorry to see him all in a moment turn\nso old and sick.\n\n“Come, Bill, you know me; you know an old shipmate, Bill, surely,” said\nthe stranger.\n\nThe captain made a sort of gasp.\n\n“Black Dog!” said he.\n\n“And who else?” returned the other, getting more at his ease. “Black\nDog as ever was, come for to see his old shipmate Billy, at the Admiral\nBenbow inn. Ah, Bill, Bill, we have seen a sight of times, us two, since\nI lost them two talons,” holding up his mutilated hand.\n\n“Now, look here,” said the captain; “you've run me down; here I am;\nwell, then, speak up; what is it?”\n\n“That's you, Bill,” returned Black Dog, “you're in the right of it,\nBilly. I'll have a glass of rum from this dear child here, as I've took\nsuch a liking to; and we'll sit down, if you please, and talk square,\nlike old shipmates.”\n\nWhen I returned with the rum, they were already seated on either side\nof the captain's breakfast-table--Black Dog next to the door and\nsitting sideways so as to have one eye on his old shipmate and one, as I\nthought, on his retreat.\n\nHe bade me go and leave the door wide open. “None of your keyholes for\nme, sonny,” he said; and I left them together and retired into the bar.\n\nFor a long time, though I certainly did my best to listen, I could hear\nnothing but a low gattling; but at last the voices began to grow higher,\nand I could pick up a word or two, mostly oaths, from the captain.\n\n“No, no, no, no; and an end of it!” he cried once. And again, “If it\ncomes to swinging, swing all, say I.”\n\nThen all of a sudden there was a tremendous explosion of oaths and\nother noises--the chair and table went over in a lump, a clash of steel\nfollowed, and then a cry of pain, and the next instant I saw Black\nDog in full flight, and the captain hotly pursuing, both with drawn\ncutlasses, and the former streaming blood from the left shoulder. Just\nat the door the captain aimed at the fugitive one last tremendous\ncut, which would certainly have split him to the chine had it not been\nintercepted by our big signboard of Admiral Benbow. You may see the\nnotch on the lower side of the frame to this day.\n\nThat blow was the last of the battle. Once out upon the road, Black\nDog, in spite of his wound, showed a wonderful clean pair of heels and\ndisappeared over the edge of the hill in half a minute. The captain, for\nhis part, stood staring at the signboard like a bewildered man. Then he\npassed his hand over his eyes several times and at last turned back into\nthe house.\n\n“Jim,” says he, “rum”; and as he spoke, he reeled a little, and caught\nhimself with one hand against the wall.\n\n“Are you hurt?” cried I.\n\n“Rum,” he repeated. “I must get away from here. Rum! Rum!”\n\nI ran to fetch it, but I was quite unsteadied by all that had fallen\nout, and I broke one glass and fouled the tap, and while I was still\ngetting in my own way, I heard a loud fall in the parlour, and running\nin, beheld the captain lying full length upon the floor. At the same\ninstant my mother, alarmed by the cries and fighting, came running\ndownstairs to help me. Between us we raised his head. He was breathing\nvery loud and hard, but his eyes were closed and his face a horrible\ncolour.\n\n“Dear, deary me,” cried my mother, “what a disgrace upon the house! And\nyour poor father sick!”\n\nIn the meantime, we had no idea what to do to help the captain, nor any\nother thought but that he had got his death-hurt in the scuffle with\nthe stranger. I got the rum, to be sure, and tried to put it down his\nthroat, but his teeth were tightly shut and his jaws as strong as iron.\nIt was a happy relief for us when the door opened and Doctor Livesey\ncame in, on his visit to my father.\n\n“Oh, doctor,” we cried, “what shall we do? Where is he wounded?”\n\n“Wounded? A fiddle-stick's end!” said the doctor. “No more wounded than\nyou or I. The man has had a stroke, as I warned him. Now, Mrs. Hawkins,\njust you run upstairs to your husband and tell him, if possible, nothing\nabout it. For my part, I must do my best to save this fellow's trebly\nworthless life; Jim, you get me a basin.”\n\nWhen I got back with the basin, the doctor had already ripped up the\ncaptain's sleeve and exposed his great sinewy arm. It was tattooed\nin several places. “Here's luck,” “A fair wind,” and “Billy Bones his\nfancy,” were very neatly and clearly executed on the forearm; and up\nnear the shoulder there was a sketch of a gallows and a man hanging from\nit--done, as I thought, with great spirit.\n\n“Prophetic,” said the doctor, touching this picture with his finger.\n“And now, Master Billy Bones, if that be your name, we'll have a look at\nthe colour of your blood. Jim,” he said, “are you afraid of blood?”\n\n“No, sir,” said I.\n\n“Well, then,” said he, “you hold the basin”; and with that he took his\nlancet and opened a vein.\n\nA great deal of blood was taken before the captain opened his eyes\nand looked mistily about him. First he recognized the doctor with\nan unmistakable frown; then his glance fell upon me, and he looked\nrelieved. But suddenly his colour changed, and he tried to raise\nhimself, crying, “Where's Black Dog?”\n\n“There is no Black Dog here,” said the doctor, “except what you have\non your own back. You have been drinking rum; you have had a stroke,\nprecisely as I told you; and I have just, very much against my own will,\ndragged you headforemost out of the grave. Now, Mr. Bones--”\n\n“That's not my name,” he interrupted.\n\n“Much I care,” returned the doctor. “It's the name of a buccaneer of my\nacquaintance; and I call you by it for the sake of shortness, and what I\nhave to say to you is this; one glass of rum won't kill you, but if\nyou take one you'll take another and another, and I stake my wig if you\ndon't break off short, you'll die--do you understand that?--die, and go\nto your own place, like the man in the Bible. Come, now, make an effort.\nI'll help you to your bed for once.”\n\nBetween us, with much trouble, we managed to hoist him upstairs, and\nlaid him on his bed, where his head fell back on the pillow as if he\nwere almost fainting.\n\n“Now, mind you,” said the doctor, “I clear my conscience--the name of\nrum for you is death.”\n\nAnd with that he went off to see my father, taking me with him by the\narm.\n\n“This is nothing,” he said as soon as he had closed the door. “I have\ndrawn blood enough to keep him quiet awhile; he should lie for a week\nwhere he is--that is the best thing for him and you; but another stroke\nwould settle him.”\n\n\n\n\n3\n\nThe Black Spot\n\nABOUT noon I stopped at the captain's door with some cooling drinks\nand medicines. He was lying very much as we had left him, only a little\nhigher, and he seemed both weak and excited.\n\n“Jim,” he said, “you're the only one here that's worth anything, and you\nknow I've been always good to you. Never a month but I've given you a\nsilver fourpenny for yourself. And now you see, mate, I'm pretty low,\nand deserted by all; and Jim, you'll bring me one noggin of rum, now,\nwon't you, matey?”\n\n“The doctor--” I began.\n\nBut he broke in cursing the doctor, in a feeble voice but heartily.\n“Doctors is all swabs,” he said; “and that doctor there, why, what do\nhe know about seafaring men? I been in places hot as pitch, and mates\ndropping round with Yellow Jack, and the blessed land a-heaving like the\nsea with earthquakes--what to the doctor know of lands like that?--and I\nlived on rum, I tell you. It's been meat and drink, and man and wife,\nto me; and if I'm not to have my rum now I'm a poor old hulk on a lee\nshore, my blood'll be on you, Jim, and that doctor swab”; and he ran on\nagain for a while with curses. “Look, Jim, how my fingers fidges,”\n he continued in the pleading tone. “I can't keep 'em still, not I. I\nhaven't had a drop this blessed day. That doctor's a fool, I tell you.\nIf I don't have a dram o' rum, Jim, I'll have the horrors; I seen some\non 'em already. I seen old Flint in the corner there, behind you; as\nplain as print, I seen him; and if I get the horrors, I'm a man that\nhas lived rough, and I'll raise Cain. Your doctor hisself said one glass\nwouldn't hurt me. I'll give you a golden guinea for a noggin, Jim.”\n\nHe was growing more and more excited, and this alarmed me for my father,\nwho was very low that day and needed quiet; besides, I was reassured by\nthe doctor's words, now quoted to me, and rather offended by the offer\nof a bribe.\n\n“I want none of your money,” said I, “but what you owe my father. I'll\nget you one glass, and no more.”\n\nWhen I brought it to him, he seized it greedily and drank it out.\n\n“Aye, aye,” said he, “that's some better, sure enough. And now, matey,\ndid that doctor say how long I was to lie here in this old berth?”\n\n“A week at least,” said I.\n\n“Thunder!” he cried. “A week! I can't do that; they'd have the black\nspot on me by then. The lubbers is going about to get the wind of me\nthis blessed moment; lubbers as couldn't keep what they got, and want to\nnail what is another's. Is that seamanly behaviour, now, I want to know?\nBut I'm a saving soul. I never wasted good money of mine, nor lost it\nneither; and I'll trick 'em again. I'm not afraid on 'em. I'll shake out\nanother reef, matey, and daddle 'em again.”\n\nAs he was thus speaking, he had risen from bed with great difficulty,\nholding to my shoulder with a grip that almost made me cry out, and\nmoving his legs like so much dead weight. His words, spirited as they\nwere in meaning, contrasted sadly with the weakness of the voice in\nwhich they were uttered. He paused when he had got into a sitting\nposition on the edge.\n\n“That doctor's done me,” he murmured. “My ears is singing. Lay me back.”\n\nBefore I could do much to help him he had fallen back again to his\nformer place, where he lay for a while silent.\n\n“Jim,” he said at length, “you saw that seafaring man today?”\n\n“Black Dog?” I asked.\n\n“Ah! Black Dog,” says he. “HE'S a bad un; but there's worse that put him\non. Now, if I can't get away nohow, and they tip me the black spot, mind\nyou, it's my old sea-chest they're after; you get on a horse--you can,\ncan't you? Well, then, you get on a horse, and go to--well, yes,\nI will!--to that eternal doctor swab, and tell him to pipe all\nhands--magistrates and sich--and he'll lay 'em aboard at the Admiral\nBenbow--all old Flint's crew, man and boy, all on 'em that's left. I was\nfirst mate, I was, old Flint's first mate, and I'm the on'y one as knows\nthe place. He gave it me at Savannah, when he lay a-dying, like as if I\nwas to now, you see. But you won't peach unless they get the black spot\non me, or unless you see that Black Dog again or a seafaring man with\none leg, Jim--him above all.”\n\n“But what is the black spot, captain?” I asked.\n\n“That's a summons, mate. I'll tell you if they get that. But you keep\nyour weather-eye open, Jim, and I'll share with you equals, upon my\nhonour.”\n\nHe wandered a little longer, his voice growing weaker; but soon after I\nhad given him his medicine, which he took like a child, with the remark,\n“If ever a seaman wanted drugs, it's me,” he fell at last into a heavy,\nswoon-like sleep, in which I left him. What I should have done had all\ngone well I do not know. Probably I should have told the whole story to\nthe doctor, for I was in mortal fear lest the captain should repent of\nhis confessions and make an end of me. But as things fell out, my poor\nfather died quite suddenly that evening, which put all other matters\non one side. Our natural distress, the visits of the neighbours, the\narranging of the funeral, and all the work of the inn to be carried on\nin the meanwhile kept me so busy that I had scarcely time to think of\nthe captain, far less to be afraid of him.\n\nHe got downstairs next morning, to be sure, and had his meals as usual,\nthough he ate little and had more, I am afraid, than his usual supply of\nrum, for he helped himself out of the bar, scowling and blowing through\nhis nose, and no one dared to cross him. On the night before the funeral\nhe was as drunk as ever; and it was shocking, in that house of mourning,\nto hear him singing away at his ugly old sea-song; but weak as he was,\nwe were all in the fear of death for him, and the doctor was suddenly\ntaken up with a case many miles away and was never near the house after\nmy father's death. I have said the captain was weak, and indeed he\nseemed rather to grow weaker than regain his strength. He clambered up\nand down stairs, and went from the parlour to the bar and back again,\nand sometimes put his nose out of doors to smell the sea, holding on to\nthe walls as he went for support and breathing hard and fast like a man\non a steep mountain. He never particularly addressed me, and it is my\nbelief he had as good as forgotten his confidences; but his temper was\nmore flighty, and allowing for his bodily weakness, more violent than\never. He had an alarming way now when he was drunk of drawing his\ncutlass and laying it bare before him on the table. But with all that,\nhe minded people less and seemed shut up in his own thoughts and rather\nwandering. Once, for instance, to our extreme wonder, he piped up to a\ndifferent air, a kind of country love-song that he must have learned in\nhis youth before he had begun to follow the sea.\n\nSo things passed until, the day after the funeral, and about three\no'clock of a bitter, foggy, frosty afternoon, I was standing at the door\nfor a moment, full of sad thoughts about my father, when I saw someone\ndrawing slowly near along the road. He was plainly blind, for he tapped\nbefore him with a stick and wore a great green shade over his eyes and\nnose; and he was hunched, as if with age or weakness, and wore a huge\nold tattered sea-cloak with a hood that made him appear positively\ndeformed. I never saw in my life a more dreadful-looking figure.\nHe stopped a little from the inn, and raising his voice in an odd\nsing-song, addressed the air in front of him, “Will any kind friend\ninform a poor blind man, who has lost the precious sight of his eyes in\nthe gracious defence of his native country, England--and God bless King\nGeorge!--where or in what part of this country he may now be?”\n\n“You are at the Admiral Benbow, Black Hill Cove, my good man,” said I.\n\n“I hear a voice,” said he, “a young voice. Will you give me your hand,\nmy kind young friend, and lead me in?”\n\nI held out my hand, and the horrible, soft-spoken, eyeless creature\ngripped it in a moment like a vise. I was so much startled that I\nstruggled to withdraw, but the blind man pulled me close up to him with\na single action of his arm.\n\n“Now, boy,” he said, “take me in to the captain.”\n\n“Sir,” said I, “upon my word I dare not.”\n\n“Oh,” he sneered, “that's it! Take me in straight or I'll break your\narm.”\n\nAnd he gave it, as he spoke, a wrench that made me cry out.\n\n“Sir,” said I, “it is for yourself I mean. The captain is not what he\nused to be. He sits with a drawn cutlass. Another gentleman--”\n\n“Come, now, march,” interrupted he; and I never heard a voice so cruel,\nand cold, and ugly as that blind man's. It cowed me more than the pain,\nand I began to obey him at once, walking straight in at the door and\ntowards the parlour, where our sick old buccaneer was sitting, dazed\nwith rum. The blind man clung close to me, holding me in one iron fist\nand leaning almost more of his weight on me than I could carry. “Lead me\nstraight up to him, and when I'm in view, cry out, 'Here's a friend\nfor you, Bill.' If you don't, I'll do this,” and with that he gave me a\ntwitch that I thought would have made me faint. Between this and that, I\nwas so utterly terrified of the blind beggar that I forgot my terror of\nthe captain, and as I opened the parlour door, cried out the words he\nhad ordered in a trembling voice.\n\nThe poor captain raised his eyes, and at one look the rum went out of\nhim and left him staring sober. The expression of his face was not so\nmuch of terror as of mortal sickness. He made a movement to rise, but I\ndo not believe he had enough force left in his body.\n\n“Now, Bill, sit where you are,” said the beggar. “If I can't see, I can\nhear a finger stirring. Business is business. Hold out your left hand.\nBoy, take his left hand by the wrist and bring it near to my right.”\n\nWe both obeyed him to the letter, and I saw him pass something from the\nhollow of the hand that held his stick into the palm of the captain's,\nwhich closed upon it instantly.\n\n“And now that's done,” said the blind man; and at the words he suddenly\nleft hold of me, and with incredible accuracy and nimbleness,\nskipped out of the parlour and into the road, where, as I still stood\nmotionless, I could hear his stick go tap-tap-tapping into the distance.\n\nIt was some time before either I or the captain seemed to gather our\nsenses, but at length, and about at the same moment, I released his\nwrist, which I was still holding, and he drew in his hand and looked\nsharply into the palm.\n\n“Ten o'clock!” he cried. “Six hours. We'll do them yet,” and he sprang\nto his feet.\n\nEven as he did so, he reeled, put his hand to his throat, stood swaying\nfor a moment, and then, with a peculiar sound, fell from his whole\nheight face foremost to the floor.\n\nI ran to him at once, calling to my mother. But haste was all in vain.\nThe captain had been struck dead by thundering apoplexy. It is a curious\nthing to understand, for I had certainly never liked the man, though of\nlate I had begun to pity him, but as soon as I saw that he was dead, I\nburst into a flood of tears. It was the second death I had known, and\nthe sorrow of the first was still fresh in my heart.\n\n\n\n\n4\n\nThe Sea-chest\n\nI LOST no time, of course, in telling my mother all that I knew, and\nperhaps should have told her long before, and we saw ourselves at once\nin a difficult and dangerous position. Some of the man's money--if\nhe had any--was certainly due to us, but it was not likely that our\ncaptain's shipmates, above all the two specimens seen by me, Black\nDog and the blind beggar, would be inclined to give up their booty in\npayment of the dead man's debts. The captain's order to mount at\nonce and ride for Doctor Livesey would have left my mother alone\nand unprotected, which was not to be thought of. Indeed, it seemed\nimpossible for either of us to remain much longer in the house; the fall\nof coals in the kitchen grate, the very ticking of the clock, filled\nus with alarms. The neighbourhood, to our ears, seemed haunted by\napproaching footsteps; and what between the dead body of the captain\non the parlour floor and the thought of that detestable blind beggar\nhovering near at hand and ready to return, there were moments when, as\nthe saying goes, I jumped in my skin for terror. Something must speedily\nbe resolved upon, and it occurred to us at last to go forth together\nand seek help in the neighbouring hamlet. No sooner said than done.\nBare-headed as we were, we ran out at once in the gathering evening and\nthe frosty fog.\n\nThe hamlet lay not many hundred yards away, though out of view, on the\nother side of the next cove; and what greatly encouraged me, it was\nin an opposite direction from that whence the blind man had made his\nappearance and whither he had presumably returned. We were not many\nminutes on the road, though we sometimes stopped to lay hold of each\nother and hearken. But there was no unusual sound--nothing but the low\nwash of the ripple and the croaking of the inmates of the wood.\n\nIt was already candle-light when we reached the hamlet, and I shall\nnever forget how much I was cheered to see the yellow shine in doors and\nwindows; but that, as it proved, was the best of the help we were likely\nto get in that quarter. For--you would have thought men would have been\nashamed of themselves--no soul would consent to return with us to the\nAdmiral Benbow. The more we told of our troubles, the more--man, woman,\nand child--they clung to the shelter of their houses. The name of\nCaptain Flint, though it was strange to me, was well enough known to\nsome there and carried a great weight of terror. Some of the men who\nhad been to field-work on the far side of the Admiral Benbow remembered,\nbesides, to have seen several strangers on the road, and taking them to\nbe smugglers, to have bolted away; and one at least had seen a little\nlugger in what we called Kitt's Hole. For that matter, anyone who was a\ncomrade of the captain's was enough to frighten them to death. And the\nshort and the long of the matter was, that while we could get several\nwho were willing enough to ride to Dr. Livesey's, which lay in another\ndirection, not one would help us to defend the inn.\n\nThey say cowardice is infectious; but then argument is, on the other\nhand, a great emboldener; and so when each had said his say, my mother\nmade them a speech. She would not, she declared, lose money that\nbelonged to her fatherless boy; “If none of the rest of you dare,”\n she said, “Jim and I dare. Back we will go, the way we came, and small\nthanks to you big, hulking, chicken-hearted men. We'll have that chest\nopen, if we die for it. And I'll thank you for that bag, Mrs. Crossley,\nto bring back our lawful money in.”\n\nOf course I said I would go with my mother, and of course they all cried\nout at our foolhardiness, but even then not a man would go along with\nus. All they would do was to give me a loaded pistol lest we were\nattacked, and to promise to have horses ready saddled in case we were\npursued on our return, while one lad was to ride forward to the doctor's\nin search of armed assistance.\n\nMy heart was beating finely when we two set forth in the cold night upon\nthis dangerous venture. A full moon was beginning to rise and peered\nredly through the upper edges of the fog, and this increased our haste,\nfor it was plain, before we came forth again, that all would be as\nbright as day, and our departure exposed to the eyes of any watchers.\nWe slipped along the hedges, noiseless and swift, nor did we see or hear\nanything to increase our terrors, till, to our relief, the door of the\nAdmiral Benbow had closed behind us.\n\nI slipped the bolt at once, and we stood and panted for a moment in the\ndark, alone in the house with the dead captain's body. Then my mother\ngot a candle in the bar, and holding each other's hands, we advanced\ninto the parlour. He lay as we had left him, on his back, with his eyes\nopen and one arm stretched out.\n\n“Draw down the blind, Jim,” whispered my mother; “they might come and\nwatch outside. And now,” said she when I had done so, “we have to get\nthe key off THAT; and who's to touch it, I should like to know!” and she\ngave a kind of sob as she said the words.\n\nI went down on my knees at once. On the floor close to his hand there\nwas a little round of paper, blackened on the one side. I could not\ndoubt that this was the BLACK SPOT; and taking it up, I found written\non the other side, in a very good, clear hand, this short message: “You\nhave till ten tonight.”\n\n“He had till ten, Mother,” said I; and just as I said it, our old clock\nbegan striking. This sudden noise startled us shockingly; but the news\nwas good, for it was only six.\n\n“Now, Jim,” she said, “that key.”\n\nI felt in his pockets, one after another. A few small coins, a thimble,\nand some thread and big needles, a piece of pigtail tobacco bitten away\nat the end, his gully with the crooked handle, a pocket compass, and a\ntinder box were all that they contained, and I began to despair.\n\n“Perhaps it's round his neck,” suggested my mother.\n\nOvercoming a strong repugnance, I tore open his shirt at the neck, and\nthere, sure enough, hanging to a bit of tarry string, which I cut with\nhis own gully, we found the key. At this triumph we were filled with\nhope and hurried upstairs without delay to the little room where he had\nslept so long and where his box had stood since the day of his arrival.\n\nIt was like any other seaman's chest on the outside, the initial “B”\n burned on the top of it with a hot iron, and the corners somewhat\nsmashed and broken as by long, rough usage.\n\n“Give me the key,” said my mother; and though the lock was very stiff,\nshe had turned it and thrown back the lid in a twinkling.\n\nA strong smell of tobacco and tar rose from the interior, but nothing\nwas to be seen on the top except a suit of very good clothes, carefully\nbrushed and folded. They had never been worn, my mother said. Under\nthat, the miscellany began--a quadrant, a tin canikin, several sticks of\ntobacco, two brace of very handsome pistols, a piece of bar silver, an\nold Spanish watch and some other trinkets of little value and mostly of\nforeign make, a pair of compasses mounted with brass, and five or six\ncurious West Indian shells. I have often wondered since why he should\nhave carried about these shells with him in his wandering, guilty, and\nhunted life.\n\nIn the meantime, we had found nothing of any value but the silver and\nthe trinkets, and neither of these were in our way. Underneath there\nwas an old boat-cloak, whitened with sea-salt on many a harbour-bar. My\nmother pulled it up with impatience, and there lay before us, the last\nthings in the chest, a bundle tied up in oilcloth, and looking like\npapers, and a canvas bag that gave forth, at a touch, the jingle of\ngold.\n\n“I'll show these rogues that I'm an honest woman,” said my mother. “I'll\nhave my dues, and not a farthing over. Hold Mrs. Crossley's bag.” And\nshe began to count over the amount of the captain's score from the\nsailor's bag into the one that I was holding.\n\nIt was a long, difficult business, for the coins were of all countries\nand sizes--doubloons, and louis d'ors, and guineas, and pieces of eight,\nand I know not what besides, all shaken together at random. The guineas,\ntoo, were about the scarcest, and it was with these only that my mother\nknew how to make her count.\n\nWhen we were about half-way through, I suddenly put my hand upon her\narm, for I had heard in the silent frosty air a sound that brought my\nheart into my mouth--the tap-tapping of the blind man's stick upon the\nfrozen road. It drew nearer and nearer, while we sat holding our breath.\nThen it struck sharp on the inn door, and then we could hear the handle\nbeing turned and the bolt rattling as the wretched being tried to enter;\nand then there was a long time of silence both within and without.\nAt last the tapping recommenced, and, to our indescribable joy and\ngratitude, died slowly away again until it ceased to be heard.\n\n“Mother,” said I, “take the whole and let's be going,” for I was sure\nthe bolted door must have seemed suspicious and would bring the whole\nhornet's nest about our ears, though how thankful I was that I had\nbolted it, none could tell who had never met that terrible blind man.\n\nBut my mother, frightened as she was, would not consent to take a\nfraction more than was due to her and was obstinately unwilling to be\ncontent with less. It was not yet seven, she said, by a long way; she\nknew her rights and she would have them; and she was still arguing with\nme when a little low whistle sounded a good way off upon the hill. That\nwas enough, and more than enough, for both of us.\n\n“I'll take what I have,” she said, jumping to her feet.\n\n“And I'll take this to square the count,” said I, picking up the oilskin\npacket.\n\nNext moment we were both groping downstairs, leaving the candle by\nthe empty chest; and the next we had opened the door and were in full\nretreat. We had not started a moment too soon. The fog was rapidly\ndispersing; already the moon shone quite clear on the high ground on\neither side; and it was only in the exact bottom of the dell and round\nthe tavern door that a thin veil still hung unbroken to conceal the\nfirst steps of our escape. Far less than half-way to the hamlet, very\nlittle beyond the bottom of the hill, we must come forth into the\nmoonlight. Nor was this all, for the sound of several footsteps running\ncame already to our ears, and as we looked back in their direction, a\nlight tossing to and fro and still rapidly advancing showed that one of\nthe newcomers carried a lantern.\n\n“My dear,” said my mother suddenly, “take the money and run on. I am\ngoing to faint.”\n\nThis was certainly the end for both of us, I thought. How I cursed the\ncowardice of the neighbours; how I blamed my poor mother for her honesty\nand her greed, for her past foolhardiness and present weakness! We were\njust at the little bridge, by good fortune; and I helped her, tottering\nas she was, to the edge of the bank, where, sure enough, she gave a sigh\nand fell on my shoulder. I do not know how I found the strength to do it\nat all, and I am afraid it was roughly done, but I managed to drag her\ndown the bank and a little way under the arch. Farther I could not move\nher, for the bridge was too low to let me do more than crawl below it.\nSo there we had to stay--my mother almost entirely exposed and both of\nus within earshot of the inn.\n\n\n\n\n5\n\nThe Last of the Blind Man\n\nMY curiosity, in a sense, was stronger than my fear, for I could not\nremain where I was, but crept back to the bank again, whence, sheltering\nmy head behind a bush of broom, I might command the road before our\ndoor. I was scarcely in position ere my enemies began to arrive, seven\nor eight of them, running hard, their feet beating out of time along\nthe road and the man with the lantern some paces in front. Three men ran\ntogether, hand in hand; and I made out, even through the mist, that the\nmiddle man of this trio was the blind beggar. The next moment his voice\nshowed me that I was right.\n\n“Down with the door!” he cried.\n\n“Aye, aye, sir!” answered two or three; and a rush was made upon the\nAdmiral Benbow, the lantern-bearer following; and then I could see\nthem pause, and hear speeches passed in a lower key, as if they were\nsurprised to find the door open. But the pause was brief, for the blind\nman again issued his commands. His voice sounded louder and higher, as\nif he were afire with eagerness and rage.\n\n“In, in, in!” he shouted, and cursed them for their delay.\n\nFour or five of them obeyed at once, two remaining on the road with the\nformidable beggar. There was a pause, then a cry of surprise, and then a\nvoice shouting from the house, “Bill's dead.”\n\nBut the blind man swore at them again for their delay.\n\n“Search him, some of you shirking lubbers, and the rest of you aloft and\nget the chest,” he cried.\n\nI could hear their feet rattling up our old stairs, so that the\nhouse must have shook with it. Promptly afterwards, fresh sounds of\nastonishment arose; the window of the captain's room was thrown open\nwith a slam and a jingle of broken glass, and a man leaned out into the\nmoonlight, head and shoulders, and addressed the blind beggar on the\nroad below him.\n\n“Pew,” he cried, “they've been before us. Someone's turned the chest out\nalow and aloft.”\n\n“Is it there?” roared Pew.\n\n“The money's there.”\n\nThe blind man cursed the money.\n\n“Flint's fist, I mean,” he cried.\n\n“We don't see it here nohow,” returned the man.\n\n“Here, you below there, is it on Bill?” cried the blind man again.\n\nAt that another fellow, probably him who had remained below to search\nthe captain's body, came to the door of the inn. “Bill's been overhauled\na'ready,” said he; “nothin' left.”\n\n“It's these people of the inn--it's that boy. I wish I had put his eyes\nout!” cried the blind man, Pew. “There were no time ago--they had the\ndoor bolted when I tried it. Scatter, lads, and find 'em.”\n\n“Sure enough, they left their glim here,” said the fellow from the\nwindow.\n\n“Scatter and find 'em! Rout the house out!” reiterated Pew, striking\nwith his stick upon the road.\n\nThen there followed a great to-do through all our old inn, heavy feet\npounding to and fro, furniture thrown over, doors kicked in, until the\nvery rocks re-echoed and the men came out again, one after another, on\nthe road and declared that we were nowhere to be found. And just\nthe same whistle that had alarmed my mother and myself over the dead\ncaptain's money was once more clearly audible through the night,\nbut this time twice repeated. I had thought it to be the blind man's\ntrumpet, so to speak, summoning his crew to the assault, but I now found\nthat it was a signal from the hillside towards the hamlet, and from its\neffect upon the buccaneers, a signal to warn them of approaching danger.\n\n“There's Dirk again,” said one. “Twice! We'll have to budge, mates.”\n\n“Budge, you skulk!” cried Pew. “Dirk was a fool and a coward from the\nfirst--you wouldn't mind him. They must be close by; they can't be far;\nyou have your hands on it. Scatter and look for them, dogs! Oh, shiver\nmy soul,” he cried, “if I had eyes!”\n\nThis appeal seemed to produce some effect, for two of the fellows began\nto look here and there among the lumber, but half-heartedly, I thought,\nand with half an eye to their own danger all the time, while the rest\nstood irresolute on the road.\n\n“You have your hands on thousands, you fools, and you hang a leg! You'd\nbe as rich as kings if you could find it, and you know it's here, and\nyou stand there skulking. There wasn't one of you dared face Bill, and\nI did it--a blind man! And I'm to lose my chance for you! I'm to be a\npoor, crawling beggar, sponging for rum, when I might be rolling in a\ncoach! If you had the pluck of a weevil in a biscuit you would catch\nthem still.”\n\n“Hang it, Pew, we've got the doubloons!” grumbled one.\n\n“They might have hid the blessed thing,” said another. “Take the\nGeorges, Pew, and don't stand here squalling.”\n\nSqualling was the word for it; Pew's anger rose so high at these\nobjections till at last, his passion completely taking the upper hand,\nhe struck at them right and left in his blindness and his stick sounded\nheavily on more than one.\n\nThese, in their turn, cursed back at the blind miscreant, threatened him\nin horrid terms, and tried in vain to catch the stick and wrest it from\nhis grasp.\n\nThis quarrel was the saving of us, for while it was still raging,\nanother sound came from the top of the hill on the side of the\nhamlet--the tramp of horses galloping. Almost at the same time a\npistol-shot, flash and report, came from the hedge side. And that was\nplainly the last signal of danger, for the buccaneers turned at once\nand ran, separating in every direction, one seaward along the cove, one\nslant across the hill, and so on, so that in half a minute not a sign of\nthem remained but Pew. Him they had deserted, whether in sheer panic\nor out of revenge for his ill words and blows I know not; but there he\nremained behind, tapping up and down the road in a frenzy, and groping\nand calling for his comrades. Finally he took a wrong turn and ran a few\nsteps past me, towards the hamlet, crying, “Johnny, Black Dog, Dirk,”\n and other names, “you won't leave old Pew, mates--not old Pew!”\n\nJust then the noise of horses topped the rise, and four or five riders\ncame in sight in the moonlight and swept at full gallop down the slope.\n\nAt this Pew saw his error, turned with a scream, and ran straight for\nthe ditch, into which he rolled. But he was on his feet again in a\nsecond and made another dash, now utterly bewildered, right under the\nnearest of the coming horses.\n\nThe rider tried to save him, but in vain. Down went Pew with a cry that\nrang high into the night; and the four hoofs trampled and spurned him\nand passed by. He fell on his side, then gently collapsed upon his face\nand moved no more.\n\nI leaped to my feet and hailed the riders. They were pulling up, at any\nrate, horrified at the accident; and I soon saw what they were. One,\ntailing out behind the rest, was a lad that had gone from the hamlet to\nDr. Livesey's; the rest were revenue officers, whom he had met by the\nway, and with whom he had had the intelligence to return at once. Some\nnews of the lugger in Kitt's Hole had found its way to Supervisor Dance\nand set him forth that night in our direction, and to that circumstance\nmy mother and I owed our preservation from death.\n\nPew was dead, stone dead. As for my mother, when we had carried her up\nto the hamlet, a little cold water and salts and that soon brought her\nback again, and she was none the worse for her terror, though she still\ncontinued to deplore the balance of the money. In the meantime the\nsupervisor rode on, as fast as he could, to Kitt's Hole; but his men\nhad to dismount and grope down the dingle, leading, and sometimes\nsupporting, their horses, and in continual fear of ambushes; so it was\nno great matter for surprise that when they got down to the Hole the\nlugger was already under way, though still close in. He hailed her. A\nvoice replied, telling him to keep out of the moonlight or he would get\nsome lead in him, and at the same time a bullet whistled close by his\narm. Soon after, the lugger doubled the point and disappeared. Mr. Dance\nstood there, as he said, “like a fish out of water,” and all he could do\nwas to dispatch a man to B---- to warn the cutter. “And that,” said he,\n“is just about as good as nothing. They've got off clean, and there's\nan end. Only,” he added, “I'm glad I trod on Master Pew's corns,” for by\nthis time he had heard my story.\n\nI went back with him to the Admiral Benbow, and you cannot imagine a\nhouse in such a state of smash; the very clock had been thrown down\nby these fellows in their furious hunt after my mother and myself;\nand though nothing had actually been taken away except the captain's\nmoney-bag and a little silver from the till, I could see at once that we\nwere ruined. Mr. Dance could make nothing of the scene.\n\n“They got the money, you say? Well, then, Hawkins, what in fortune were\nthey after? More money, I suppose?”\n\n“No, sir; not money, I think,” replied I. “In fact, sir, I believe I\nhave the thing in my breast pocket; and to tell you the truth, I should\nlike to get it put in safety.”\n\n“To be sure, boy; quite right,” said he. “I'll take it, if you like.”\n\n“I thought perhaps Dr. Livesey--” I began.\n\n“Perfectly right,” he interrupted very cheerily, “perfectly right--a\ngentleman and a magistrate. And, now I come to think of it, I might as\nwell ride round there myself and report to him or squire. Master Pew's\ndead, when all's done; not that I regret it, but he's dead, you see, and\npeople will make it out against an officer of his Majesty's revenue,\nif make it out they can. Now, I'll tell you, Hawkins, if you like, I'll\ntake you along.”\n\nI thanked him heartily for the offer, and we walked back to the hamlet\nwhere the horses were. By the time I had told mother of my purpose they\nwere all in the saddle.\n\n“Dogger,” said Mr. Dance, “you have a good horse; take up this lad\nbehind you.”\n\nAs soon as I was mounted, holding on to Dogger's belt, the supervisor\ngave the word, and the party struck out at a bouncing trot on the road\nto Dr. Livesey's house.\n\n\n\n\n6\n\nThe Captain's Papers\n\nWE rode hard all the way till we drew up before Dr. Livesey's door. The\nhouse was all dark to the front.\n\nMr. Dance told me to jump down and knock, and Dogger gave me a stirrup\nto descend by. The door was opened almost at once by the maid.\n\n“Is Dr. Livesey in?” I asked.\n\nNo, she said, he had come home in the afternoon but had gone up to the\nhall to dine and pass the evening with the squire.\n\n“So there we go, boys,” said Mr. Dance.\n\nThis time, as the distance was short, I did not mount, but ran with\nDogger's stirrup-leather to the lodge gates and up the long, leafless,\nmoonlit avenue to where the white line of the hall buildings looked on\neither hand on great old gardens. Here Mr. Dance dismounted, and taking\nme along with him, was admitted at a word into the house.\n\nThe servant led us down a matted passage and showed us at the end into a\ngreat library, all lined with bookcases and busts upon the top of them,\nwhere the squire and Dr. Livesey sat, pipe in hand, on either side of a\nbright fire.\n\nI had never seen the squire so near at hand. He was a tall man, over six\nfeet high, and broad in proportion, and he had a bluff, rough-and-ready\nface, all roughened and reddened and lined in his long travels. His\neyebrows were very black, and moved readily, and this gave him a look of\nsome temper, not bad, you would say, but quick and high.\n\n“Come in, Mr. Dance,” says he, very stately and condescending.\n\n“Good evening, Dance,” says the doctor with a nod. “And good evening to\nyou, friend Jim. What good wind brings you here?”\n\nThe supervisor stood up straight and stiff and told his story like a\nlesson; and you should have seen how the two gentlemen leaned forward\nand looked at each other, and forgot to smoke in their surprise and\ninterest. When they heard how my mother went back to the inn, Dr.\nLivesey fairly slapped his thigh, and the squire cried “Bravo!” and\nbroke his long pipe against the grate. Long before it was done, Mr.\nTrelawney (that, you will remember, was the squire's name) had got up\nfrom his seat and was striding about the room, and the doctor, as if to\nhear the better, had taken off his powdered wig and sat there looking\nvery strange indeed with his own close-cropped black poll.\n\nAt last Mr. Dance finished the story.\n\n“Mr. Dance,” said the squire, “you are a very noble fellow. And as for\nriding down that black, atrocious miscreant, I regard it as an act of\nvirtue, sir, like stamping on a cockroach. This lad Hawkins is a trump,\nI perceive. Hawkins, will you ring that bell? Mr. Dance must have some\nale.”\n\n“And so, Jim,” said the doctor, “you have the thing that they were\nafter, have you?”\n\n“Here it is, sir,” said I, and gave him the oilskin packet.\n\nThe doctor looked it all over, as if his fingers were itching to open\nit; but instead of doing that, he put it quietly in the pocket of his\ncoat.\n\n“Squire,” said he, “when Dance has had his ale he must, of course, be\noff on his Majesty's service; but I mean to keep Jim Hawkins here to\nsleep at my house, and with your permission, I propose we should have up\nthe cold pie and let him sup.”\n\n“As you will, Livesey,” said the squire; “Hawkins has earned better than\ncold pie.”\n\nSo a big pigeon pie was brought in and put on a sidetable, and I made\na hearty supper, for I was as hungry as a hawk, while Mr. Dance was\nfurther complimented and at last dismissed.\n\n“And now, squire,” said the doctor.\n\n“And now, Livesey,” said the squire in the same breath.\n\n“One at a time, one at a time,” laughed Dr. Livesey. “You have heard of\nthis Flint, I suppose?”\n\n“Heard of him!” cried the squire. “Heard of him, you say! He was the\nbloodthirstiest buccaneer that sailed. Blackbeard was a child to Flint.\nThe Spaniards were so prodigiously afraid of him that, I tell you, sir,\nI was sometimes proud he was an Englishman. I've seen his top-sails with\nthese eyes, off Trinidad, and the cowardly son of a rum-puncheon that I\nsailed with put back--put back, sir, into Port of Spain.”\n\n“Well, I've heard of him myself, in England,” said the doctor. “But the\npoint is, had he money?”\n\n“Money!” cried the squire. “Have you heard the story? What were these\nvillains after but money? What do they care for but money? For what\nwould they risk their rascal carcasses but money?”\n\n“That we shall soon know,” replied the doctor. “But you are so\nconfoundedly hot-headed and exclamatory that I cannot get a word in.\nWhat I want to know is this: Supposing that I have here in my pocket\nsome clue to where Flint buried his treasure, will that treasure amount\nto much?”\n\n“Amount, sir!” cried the squire. “It will amount to this: If we have the\nclue you talk about, I fit out a ship in Bristol dock, and take you and\nHawkins here along, and I'll have that treasure if I search a year.”\n\n“Very well,” said the doctor. “Now, then, if Jim is agreeable, we'll\nopen the packet”; and he laid it before him on the table.\n\nThe bundle was sewn together, and the doctor had to get out his\ninstrument case and cut the stitches with his medical scissors. It\ncontained two things--a book and a sealed paper.\n\n“First of all we'll try the book,” observed the doctor.\n\nThe squire and I were both peering over his shoulder as he opened\nit, for Dr. Livesey had kindly motioned me to come round from the\nside-table, where I had been eating, to enjoy the sport of the search.\nOn the first page there were only some scraps of writing, such as a man\nwith a pen in his hand might make for idleness or practice. One was the\nsame as the tattoo mark, “Billy Bones his fancy”; then there was “Mr. W.\nBones, mate,” “No more rum,” “Off Palm Key he got itt,” and some other\nsnatches, mostly single words and unintelligible. I could not help\nwondering who it was that had “got itt,” and what “itt” was that he got.\nA knife in his back as like as not.\n\n“Not much instruction there,” said Dr. Livesey as he passed on.\n\nThe next ten or twelve pages were filled with a curious series of\nentries. There was a date at one end of the line and at the other a\nsum of money, as in common account-books, but instead of explanatory\nwriting, only a varying number of crosses between the two. On the 12th\nof June, 1745, for instance, a sum of seventy pounds had plainly become\ndue to someone, and there was nothing but six crosses to explain the\ncause. In a few cases, to be sure, the name of a place would be added,\nas “Offe Caraccas,” or a mere entry of latitude and longitude, as “62o\n17' 20”, 19o 2' 40”.”\n\nThe record lasted over nearly twenty years, the amount of the separate\nentries growing larger as time went on, and at the end a grand total\nhad been made out after five or six wrong additions, and these words\nappended, “Bones, his pile.”\n\n“I can't make head or tail of this,” said Dr. Livesey.\n\n“The thing is as clear as noonday,” cried the squire. “This is the\nblack-hearted hound's account-book. These crosses stand for the names of\nships or towns that they sank or plundered. The sums are the scoundrel's\nshare, and where he feared an ambiguity, you see he added something\nclearer. 'Offe Caraccas,' now; you see, here was some unhappy vessel\nboarded off that coast. God help the poor souls that manned her--coral\nlong ago.”\n\n“Right!” said the doctor. “See what it is to be a traveller. Right! And\nthe amounts increase, you see, as he rose in rank.”\n\nThere was little else in the volume but a few bearings of places noted\nin the blank leaves towards the end and a table for reducing French,\nEnglish, and Spanish moneys to a common value.\n\n“Thrifty man!” cried the doctor. “He wasn't the one to be cheated.”\n\n“And now,” said the squire, “for the other.”\n\nThe paper had been sealed in several places with a thimble by way of\nseal; the very thimble, perhaps, that I had found in the captain's\npocket. The doctor opened the seals with great care, and there fell out\nthe map of an island, with latitude and longitude, soundings, names of\nhills and bays and inlets, and every particular that would be needed\nto bring a ship to a safe anchorage upon its shores. It was about nine\nmiles long and five across, shaped, you might say, like a fat dragon\nstanding up, and had two fine land-locked harbours, and a hill in the\ncentre part marked “The Spy-glass.” There were several additions of a\nlater date, but above all, three crosses of red ink--two on the north\npart of the island, one in the southwest--and beside this last, in\nthe same red ink, and in a small, neat hand, very different from the\ncaptain's tottery characters, these words: “Bulk of treasure here.”\n\nOver on the back the same hand had written this further information:\n\n     Tall tree, Spy-glass shoulder, bearing a point to\n     the N. of N.N.E.\n\n     Skeleton Island E.S.E. and by E.\n\n     Ten feet.\n\n     The bar silver is in the north cache; you can find\n     it by the trend of the east hummock, ten fathoms\n     south of the black crag with the face on it.\n\n     The arms are easy found, in the sand-hill, N.\n     point of north inlet cape, bearing E. and a\n     quarter N.\n     J.F.\n\nThat was all; but brief as it was, and to me incomprehensible, it filled\nthe squire and Dr. Livesey with delight.\n\n“Livesey,” said the squire, “you will give up this wretched practice\nat once. Tomorrow I start for Bristol. In three weeks' time--three\nweeks!--two weeks--ten days--we'll have the best ship, sir, and the\nchoicest crew in England. Hawkins shall come as cabin-boy. You'll make\na famous cabin-boy, Hawkins. You, Livesey, are ship's doctor; I am\nadmiral. We'll take Redruth, Joyce, and Hunter. We'll have favourable\nwinds, a quick passage, and not the least difficulty in finding the\nspot, and money to eat, to roll in, to play duck and drake with ever\nafter.”\n\n“Trelawney,” said the doctor, “I'll go with you; and I'll go bail for\nit, so will Jim, and be a credit to the undertaking. There's only one\nman I'm afraid of.”\n\n“And who's that?” cried the squire. “Name the dog, sir!”\n\n“You,” replied the doctor; “for you cannot hold your tongue. We are not\nthe only men who know of this paper. These fellows who attacked the\ninn tonight--bold, desperate blades, for sure--and the rest who stayed\naboard that lugger, and more, I dare say, not far off, are, one and all,\nthrough thick and thin, bound that they'll get that money. We must none\nof us go alone till we get to sea. Jim and I shall stick together in the\nmeanwhile; you'll take Joyce and Hunter when you ride to Bristol, and\nfrom first to last, not one of us must breathe a word of what we've\nfound.”\n\n“Livesey,” returned the squire, “you are always in the right of it. I'll\nbe as silent as the grave.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPART TWO--The Sea-cook\n\n\n\n\n7\n\nI Go to Bristol\n\nIT was longer than the squire imagined ere we were ready for the sea,\nand none of our first plans--not even Dr. Livesey's, of keeping me\nbeside him--could be carried out as we intended. The doctor had to go\nto London for a physician to take charge of his practice; the squire was\nhard at work at Bristol; and I lived on at the hall under the charge of\nold Redruth, the gamekeeper, almost a prisoner, but full of sea-dreams\nand the most charming anticipations of strange islands and adventures.\nI brooded by the hour together over the map, all the details of which\nI well remembered. Sitting by the fire in the housekeeper's room, I\napproached that island in my fancy from every possible direction; I\nexplored every acre of its surface; I climbed a thousand times to that\ntall hill they call the Spy-glass, and from the top enjoyed the most\nwonderful and changing prospects. Sometimes the isle was thick with\nsavages, with whom we fought, sometimes full of dangerous animals that\nhunted us, but in all my fancies nothing occurred to me so strange and\ntragic as our actual adventures.\n\nSo the weeks passed on, till one fine day there came a letter addressed\nto Dr. Livesey, with this addition, “To be opened, in the case of his\nabsence, by Tom Redruth or young Hawkins.” Obeying this order, we\nfound, or rather I found--for the gamekeeper was a poor hand at reading\nanything but print--the following important news:\n\n     Old Anchor Inn, Bristol, March 1, 17--\n\n     Dear Livesey--As I do not know whether you\n     are at the hall or still in London, I send this in\n     double to both places.\n\n     The ship is bought and fitted.  She lies at\n     anchor, ready for sea.  You never imagined a\n     sweeter schooner--a child might sail her--two\n     hundred tons; name, HISPANIOLA.\n\n     I got her through my old friend, Blandly, who\n     has proved himself throughout the most surprising\n     trump.  The admirable fellow literally slaved in\n     my interest, and so, I may say, did everyone in\n     Bristol, as soon as they got wind of the port we\n     sailed for--treasure, I mean.\n\n“Redruth,” said I, interrupting the letter, “Dr. Livesey will not like\nthat. The squire has been talking, after all.”\n\n“Well, who's a better right?” growled the gamekeeper. “A pretty rum go\nif squire ain't to talk for Dr. Livesey, I should think.”\n\nAt that I gave up all attempts at commentary and read straight on:\n\n     Blandly himself found the HISPANIOLA, and\n     by the most admirable management got her for the\n     merest trifle.  There is a class of men in Bristol\n     monstrously prejudiced against Blandly.  They go\n     the length of declaring that this honest creature\n     would do anything for money, that the HISPANIOLA\n     belonged to him, and that he sold it me absurdly\n     high--the most transparent calumnies.  None of them\n     dare, however, to deny the merits of the ship.\n\n     So far there was not a hitch.  The\n     workpeople, to be sure--riggers and what not--were\n     most annoyingly slow; but time cured that.  It was\n     the crew that troubled me.\n\n     I wished a round score of men--in case of\n     natives, buccaneers, or the odious French--and I\n     had the worry of the deuce itself to find so much\n     as half a dozen, till the most remarkable stroke\n     of fortune brought me the very man that I\n     required.\n\n     I was standing on the dock, when, by the\n     merest accident, I fell in talk with him.  I found\n     he was an old sailor, kept a public-house, knew\n     all the seafaring men in Bristol, had lost his\n     health ashore, and wanted a good berth as cook to\n     get to sea again.  He had hobbled down there that\n     morning, he said, to get a smell of the salt.\n\n     I was monstrously touched--so would you have\n     been--and, out of pure pity, I engaged him on the\n     spot to be ship's cook.  Long John Silver, he is\n     called, and has lost a leg; but that I regarded as\n     a recommendation, since he lost it in his\n     country's service, under the immortal Hawke.  He\n     has no pension, Livesey.  Imagine the abominable\n     age we live in!\n\n     Well, sir, I thought I had only found a cook,\n     but it was a crew I had discovered.  Between\n     Silver and myself we got together in a few days a\n     company of the toughest old salts imaginable--not\n     pretty to look at, but fellows, by their faces, of\n     the most indomitable spirit.  I declare we could\n     fight a frigate.\n\n     Long John even got rid of two out of the six\n     or seven I had already engaged.  He showed me in a\n     moment that they were just the sort of fresh-water\n     swabs we had to fear in an adventure of\n     importance.\n\n     I am in the most magnificent health and\n     spirits, eating like a bull, sleeping like a tree,\n     yet I shall not enjoy a moment till I hear my old\n     tarpaulins tramping round the capstan.  Seaward,\n     ho!  Hang the treasure!  It's the glory of the sea\n     that has turned my head.  So now, Livesey, come\n     post; do not lose an hour, if you respect me.\n\n     Let young Hawkins go at once to see his\n     mother, with Redruth for a guard; and then both\n     come full speed to Bristol.\n     John Trelawney\n\n     Postscript--I did not tell you that Blandly,\n     who, by the way, is to send a consort after us if\n     we don't turn up by the end of August, had found\n     an admirable fellow for sailing master--a stiff\n     man, which I regret, but in all other respects a\n     treasure.  Long John Silver unearthed a very\n     competent man for a mate, a man named Arrow.  I\n     have a boatswain who pipes, Livesey; so things\n     shall go man-o'-war fashion on board the good ship\n     HISPANIOLA.\n\n     I forgot to tell you that Silver is a man of\n     substance; I know of my own knowledge that he has\n     a banker's account, which has never been\n     overdrawn.  He leaves his wife to manage the inn;\n     and as she is a woman of colour, a pair of old\n     bachelors like you and I may be excused for\n     guessing that it is the wife, quite as much as the\n     health, that sends him back to roving.\n     J. T.\n\n     P.P.S.--Hawkins may stay one night with his\n     mother.\n     J. T.\n\nYou can fancy the excitement into which that letter put me. I was half\nbeside myself with glee; and if ever I despised a man, it was old\nTom Redruth, who could do nothing but grumble and lament. Any of the\nunder-gamekeepers would gladly have changed places with him; but such\nwas not the squire's pleasure, and the squire's pleasure was like law\namong them all. Nobody but old Redruth would have dared so much as even\nto grumble.\n\nThe next morning he and I set out on foot for the Admiral Benbow, and\nthere I found my mother in good health and spirits. The captain, who had\nso long been a cause of so much discomfort, was gone where the wicked\ncease from troubling. The squire had had everything repaired, and the\npublic rooms and the sign repainted, and had added some furniture--above\nall a beautiful armchair for mother in the bar. He had found her a boy\nas an apprentice also so that she should not want help while I was gone.\n\nIt was on seeing that boy that I understood, for the first time, my\nsituation. I had thought up to that moment of the adventures before me,\nnot at all of the home that I was leaving; and now, at sight of this\nclumsy stranger, who was to stay here in my place beside my mother, I\nhad my first attack of tears. I am afraid I led that boy a dog's life,\nfor as he was new to the work, I had a hundred opportunities of setting\nhim right and putting him down, and I was not slow to profit by them.\n\nThe night passed, and the next day, after dinner, Redruth and I were\nafoot again and on the road. I said good-bye to Mother and the\ncove where I had lived since I was born, and the dear old Admiral\nBenbow--since he was repainted, no longer quite so dear. One of my last\nthoughts was of the captain, who had so often strode along the beach\nwith his cocked hat, his sabre-cut cheek, and his old brass telescope.\nNext moment we had turned the corner and my home was out of sight.\n\nThe mail picked us up about dusk at the Royal George on the heath. I was\nwedged in between Redruth and a stout old gentleman, and in spite of the\nswift motion and the cold night air, I must have dozed a great deal from\nthe very first, and then slept like a log up hill and down dale through\nstage after stage, for when I was awakened at last it was by a punch\nin the ribs, and I opened my eyes to find that we were standing still\nbefore a large building in a city street and that the day had already\nbroken a long time.\n\n“Where are we?” I asked.\n\n“Bristol,” said Tom. “Get down.”\n\nMr. Trelawney had taken up his residence at an inn far down the docks to\nsuperintend the work upon the schooner. Thither we had now to walk, and\nour way, to my great delight, lay along the quays and beside the great\nmultitude of ships of all sizes and rigs and nations. In one, sailors\nwere singing at their work, in another there were men aloft, high over\nmy head, hanging to threads that seemed no thicker than a spider's.\nThough I had lived by the shore all my life, I seemed never to have been\nnear the sea till then. The smell of tar and salt was something new.\nI saw the most wonderful figureheads, that had all been far over the\nocean. I saw, besides, many old sailors, with rings in their ears, and\nwhiskers curled in ringlets, and tarry pigtails, and their swaggering,\nclumsy sea-walk; and if I had seen as many kings or archbishops I could\nnot have been more delighted.\n\nAnd I was going to sea myself, to sea in a schooner, with a piping\nboatswain and pig-tailed singing seamen, to sea, bound for an unknown\nisland, and to seek for buried treasure!\n\nWhile I was still in this delightful dream, we came suddenly in front\nof a large inn and met Squire Trelawney, all dressed out like a\nsea-officer, in stout blue cloth, coming out of the door with a smile on\nhis face and a capital imitation of a sailor's walk.\n\n“Here you are,” he cried, “and the doctor came last night from London.\nBravo! The ship's company complete!”\n\n“Oh, sir,” cried I, “when do we sail?”\n\n“Sail!” says he. “We sail tomorrow!”\n\n\n\n\n8\n\nAt the Sign of the Spy-glass\n\nWHEN I had done breakfasting the squire gave me a note addressed to John\nSilver, at the sign of the Spy-glass, and told me I should easily\nfind the place by following the line of the docks and keeping a bright\nlookout for a little tavern with a large brass telescope for sign. I\nset off, overjoyed at this opportunity to see some more of the ships and\nseamen, and picked my way among a great crowd of people and carts and\nbales, for the dock was now at its busiest, until I found the tavern in\nquestion.\n\nIt was a bright enough little place of entertainment. The sign was\nnewly painted; the windows had neat red curtains; the floor was cleanly\nsanded. There was a street on each side and an open door on both, which\nmade the large, low room pretty clear to see in, in spite of clouds of\ntobacco smoke.\n\nThe customers were mostly seafaring men, and they talked so loudly that\nI hung at the door, almost afraid to enter.\n\nAs I was waiting, a man came out of a side room, and at a glance I was\nsure he must be Long John. His left leg was cut off close by the hip,\nand under the left shoulder he carried a crutch, which he managed with\nwonderful dexterity, hopping about upon it like a bird. He was very tall\nand strong, with a face as big as a ham--plain and pale, but intelligent\nand smiling. Indeed, he seemed in the most cheerful spirits, whistling\nas he moved about among the tables, with a merry word or a slap on the\nshoulder for the more favoured of his guests.\n\nNow, to tell you the truth, from the very first mention of Long John in\nSquire Trelawney's letter I had taken a fear in my mind that he might\nprove to be the very one-legged sailor whom I had watched for so long at\nthe old Benbow. But one look at the man before me was enough. I had seen\nthe captain, and Black Dog, and the blind man, Pew, and I thought I knew\nwhat a buccaneer was like--a very different creature, according to me,\nfrom this clean and pleasant-tempered landlord.\n\nI plucked up courage at once, crossed the threshold, and walked right up\nto the man where he stood, propped on his crutch, talking to a customer.\n\n“Mr. Silver, sir?” I asked, holding out the note.\n\n“Yes, my lad,” said he; “such is my name, to be sure. And who may you\nbe?” And then as he saw the squire's letter, he seemed to me to give\nsomething almost like a start.\n\n“Oh!” said he, quite loud, and offering his hand. “I see. You are our\nnew cabin-boy; pleased I am to see you.”\n\nAnd he took my hand in his large firm grasp.\n\nJust then one of the customers at the far side rose suddenly and made\nfor the door. It was close by him, and he was out in the street in a\nmoment. But his hurry had attracted my notice, and I recognized him at\nglance. It was the tallow-faced man, wanting two fingers, who had come\nfirst to the Admiral Benbow.\n\n“Oh,” I cried, “stop him! It's Black Dog!”\n\n“I don't care two coppers who he is,” cried Silver. “But he hasn't paid\nhis score. Harry, run and catch him.”\n\nOne of the others who was nearest the door leaped up and started in\npursuit.\n\n“If he were Admiral Hawke he shall pay his score,” cried Silver; and\nthen, relinquishing my hand, “Who did you say he was?” he asked. “Black\nwhat?”\n\n“Dog, sir,” said I. “Has Mr. Trelawney not told you of the buccaneers?\nHe was one of them.”\n\n“So?” cried Silver. “In my house! Ben, run and help Harry. One of those\nswabs, was he? Was that you drinking with him, Morgan? Step up here.”\n\nThe man whom he called Morgan--an old, grey-haired, mahogany-faced\nsailor--came forward pretty sheepishly, rolling his quid.\n\n“Now, Morgan,” said Long John very sternly, “you never clapped your eyes\non that Black--Black Dog before, did you, now?”\n\n“Not I, sir,” said Morgan with a salute.\n\n“You didn't know his name, did you?”\n\n“No, sir.”\n\n“By the powers, Tom Morgan, it's as good for you!” exclaimed the\nlandlord. “If you had been mixed up with the like of that, you would\nnever have put another foot in my house, you may lay to that. And what\nwas he saying to you?”\n\n“I don't rightly know, sir,” answered Morgan.\n\n“Do you call that a head on your shoulders, or a blessed dead-eye?”\n cried Long John. “Don't rightly know, don't you! Perhaps you don't\nhappen to rightly know who you was speaking to, perhaps? Come, now, what\nwas he jawing--v'yages, cap'ns, ships? Pipe up! What was it?”\n\n“We was a-talkin' of keel-hauling,” answered Morgan.\n\n“Keel-hauling, was you? And a mighty suitable thing, too, and you may\nlay to that. Get back to your place for a lubber, Tom.”\n\nAnd then, as Morgan rolled back to his seat, Silver added to me in a\nconfidential whisper that was very flattering, as I thought, “He's\nquite an honest man, Tom Morgan, on'y stupid. And now,” he ran on again,\naloud, “let's see--Black Dog? No, I don't know the name, not I. Yet I\nkind of think I've--yes, I've seen the swab. He used to come here with a\nblind beggar, he used.”\n\n“That he did, you may be sure,” said I. “I knew that blind man too. His\nname was Pew.”\n\n“It was!” cried Silver, now quite excited. “Pew! That were his name for\ncertain. Ah, he looked a shark, he did! If we run down this Black Dog,\nnow, there'll be news for Cap'n Trelawney! Ben's a good runner; few\nseamen run better than Ben. He should run him down, hand over hand, by\nthe powers! He talked o' keel-hauling, did he? I'LL keel-haul him!”\n\nAll the time he was jerking out these phrases he was stumping up and\ndown the tavern on his crutch, slapping tables with his hand, and giving\nsuch a show of excitement as would have convinced an Old Bailey judge\nor a Bow Street runner. My suspicions had been thoroughly reawakened on\nfinding Black Dog at the Spy-glass, and I watched the cook narrowly. But\nhe was too deep, and too ready, and too clever for me, and by the time\nthe two men had come back out of breath and confessed that they had lost\nthe track in a crowd, and been scolded like thieves, I would have gone\nbail for the innocence of Long John Silver.\n\n“See here, now, Hawkins,” said he, “here's a blessed hard thing on a\nman like me, now, ain't it? There's Cap'n Trelawney--what's he to think?\nHere I have this confounded son of a Dutchman sitting in my own house\ndrinking of my own rum! Here you comes and tells me of it plain; and\nhere I let him give us all the slip before my blessed deadlights! Now,\nHawkins, you do me justice with the cap'n. You're a lad, you are, but\nyou're as smart as paint. I see that when you first come in. Now, here\nit is: What could I do, with this old timber I hobble on? When I was an\nA B master mariner I'd have come up alongside of him, hand over hand,\nand broached him to in a brace of old shakes, I would; but now--”\n\nAnd then, all of a sudden, he stopped, and his jaw dropped as though he\nhad remembered something.\n\n“The score!” he burst out. “Three goes o' rum! Why, shiver my timbers,\nif I hadn't forgotten my score!”\n\nAnd falling on a bench, he laughed until the tears ran down his cheeks.\nI could not help joining, and we laughed together, peal after peal,\nuntil the tavern rang again.\n\n“Why, what a precious old sea-calf I am!” he said at last, wiping his\ncheeks. “You and me should get on well, Hawkins, for I'll take my davy\nI should be rated ship's boy. But come now, stand by to go about. This\nwon't do. Dooty is dooty, messmates. I'll put on my old cockerel hat,\nand step along of you to Cap'n Trelawney, and report this here affair.\nFor mind you, it's serious, young Hawkins; and neither you nor me's come\nout of it with what I should make so bold as to call credit. Nor you\nneither, says you; not smart--none of the pair of us smart. But dash my\nbuttons! That was a good un about my score.”\n\nAnd he began to laugh again, and that so heartily, that though I did not\nsee the joke as he did, I was again obliged to join him in his mirth.\n\nOn our little walk along the quays, he made himself the most interesting\ncompanion, telling me about the different ships that we passed by,\ntheir rig, tonnage, and nationality, explaining the work that was going\nforward--how one was discharging, another taking in cargo, and a third\nmaking ready for sea--and every now and then telling me some little\nanecdote of ships or seamen or repeating a nautical phrase till I had\nlearned it perfectly. I began to see that here was one of the best of\npossible shipmates.\n\nWhen we got to the inn, the squire and Dr. Livesey were seated together,\nfinishing a quart of ale with a toast in it, before they should go\naboard the schooner on a visit of inspection.\n\nLong John told the story from first to last, with a great deal of spirit\nand the most perfect truth. “That was how it were, now, weren't it,\nHawkins?” he would say, now and again, and I could always bear him\nentirely out.\n\nThe two gentlemen regretted that Black Dog had got away, but we all\nagreed there was nothing to be done, and after he had been complimented,\nLong John took up his crutch and departed.\n\n“All hands aboard by four this afternoon,” shouted the squire after him.\n\n“Aye, aye, sir,” cried the cook, in the passage.\n\n“Well, squire,” said Dr. Livesey, “I don't put much faith in your\ndiscoveries, as a general thing; but I will say this, John Silver suits\nme.”\n\n“The man's a perfect trump,” declared the squire.\n\n“And now,” added the doctor, “Jim may come on board with us, may he\nnot?”\n\n“To be sure he may,” says squire. “Take your hat, Hawkins, and we'll see\nthe ship.”\n\n\n\n\n9\n\nPowder and Arms\n\nTHE HISPANIOLA lay some way out, and we went under the figureheads and\nround the sterns of many other ships, and their cables sometimes grated\nunderneath our keel, and sometimes swung above us. At last, however,\nwe got alongside, and were met and saluted as we stepped aboard by the\nmate, Mr. Arrow, a brown old sailor with earrings in his ears and a\nsquint. He and the squire were very thick and friendly, but I soon\nobserved that things were not the same between Mr. Trelawney and the\ncaptain.\n\nThis last was a sharp-looking man who seemed angry with everything on\nboard and was soon to tell us why, for we had hardly got down into the\ncabin when a sailor followed us.\n\n“Captain Smollett, sir, axing to speak with you,” said he.\n\n“I am always at the captain's orders. Show him in,” said the squire.\n\nThe captain, who was close behind his messenger, entered at once and\nshut the door behind him.\n\n“Well, Captain Smollett, what have you to say? All well, I hope; all\nshipshape and seaworthy?”\n\n“Well, sir,” said the captain, “better speak plain, I believe, even at\nthe risk of offence. I don't like this cruise; I don't like the men; and\nI don't like my officer. That's short and sweet.”\n\n“Perhaps, sir, you don't like the ship?” inquired the squire, very\nangry, as I could see.\n\n“I can't speak as to that, sir, not having seen her tried,” said the\ncaptain. “She seems a clever craft; more I can't say.”\n\n“Possibly, sir, you may not like your employer, either?” says the\nsquire.\n\nBut here Dr. Livesey cut in.\n\n“Stay a bit,” said he, “stay a bit. No use of such questions as that but\nto produce ill feeling. The captain has said too much or he has said too\nlittle, and I'm bound to say that I require an explanation of his words.\nYou don't, you say, like this cruise. Now, why?”\n\n“I was engaged, sir, on what we call sealed orders, to sail this ship\nfor that gentleman where he should bid me,” said the captain. “So far\nso good. But now I find that every man before the mast knows more than I\ndo. I don't call that fair, now, do you?”\n\n“No,” said Dr. Livesey, “I don't.”\n\n“Next,” said the captain, “I learn we are going after treasure--hear\nit from my own hands, mind you. Now, treasure is ticklish work; I don't\nlike treasure voyages on any account, and I don't like them, above all,\nwhen they are secret and when (begging your pardon, Mr. Trelawney) the\nsecret has been told to the parrot.”\n\n“Silver's parrot?” asked the squire.\n\n“It's a way of speaking,” said the captain. “Blabbed, I mean. It's my\nbelief neither of you gentlemen know what you are about, but I'll tell\nyou my way of it--life or death, and a close run.”\n\n“That is all clear, and, I dare say, true enough,” replied Dr. Livesey.\n“We take the risk, but we are not so ignorant as you believe us. Next,\nyou say you don't like the crew. Are they not good seamen?”\n\n“I don't like them, sir,” returned Captain Smollett. “And I think I\nshould have had the choosing of my own hands, if you go to that.”\n\n“Perhaps you should,” replied the doctor. “My friend should, perhaps,\nhave taken you along with him; but the slight, if there be one, was\nunintentional. And you don't like Mr. Arrow?”\n\n“I don't, sir. I believe he's a good seaman, but he's too free with\nthe crew to be a good officer. A mate should keep himself to\nhimself--shouldn't drink with the men before the mast!”\n\n“Do you mean he drinks?” cried the squire.\n\n“No, sir,” replied the captain, “only that he's too familiar.”\n\n“Well, now, and the short and long of it, captain?” asked the doctor.\n“Tell us what you want.”\n\n“Well, gentlemen, are you determined to go on this cruise?”\n\n“Like iron,” answered the squire.\n\n“Very good,” said the captain. “Then, as you've heard me very patiently,\nsaying things that I could not prove, hear me a few words more. They are\nputting the powder and the arms in the fore hold. Now, you have a good\nplace under the cabin; why not put them there?--first point. Then, you\nare bringing four of your own people with you, and they tell me some of\nthem are to be berthed forward. Why not give them the berths here beside\nthe cabin?--second point.”\n\n“Any more?” asked Mr. Trelawney.\n\n“One more,” said the captain. “There's been too much blabbing already.”\n\n“Far too much,” agreed the doctor.\n\n“I'll tell you what I've heard myself,” continued Captain Smollett:\n“that you have a map of an island, that there's crosses on the map to\nshow where treasure is, and that the island lies--” And then he named\nthe latitude and longitude exactly.\n\n“I never told that,” cried the squire, “to a soul!”\n\n“The hands know it, sir,” returned the captain.\n\n“Livesey, that must have been you or Hawkins,” cried the squire.\n\n“It doesn't much matter who it was,” replied the doctor. And I could\nsee that neither he nor the captain paid much regard to Mr. Trelawney's\nprotestations. Neither did I, to be sure, he was so loose a talker; yet\nin this case I believe he was really right and that nobody had told the\nsituation of the island.\n\n“Well, gentlemen,” continued the captain, “I don't know who has this\nmap; but I make it a point, it shall be kept secret even from me and Mr.\nArrow. Otherwise I would ask you to let me resign.”\n\n“I see,” said the doctor. “You wish us to keep this matter dark and to\nmake a garrison of the stern part of the ship, manned with my friend's\nown people, and provided with all the arms and powder on board. In other\nwords, you fear a mutiny.”\n\n“Sir,” said Captain Smollett, “with no intention to take offence, I\ndeny your right to put words into my mouth. No captain, sir, would be\njustified in going to sea at all if he had ground enough to say that. As\nfor Mr. Arrow, I believe him thoroughly honest; some of the men are the\nsame; all may be for what I know. But I am responsible for the ship's\nsafety and the life of every man Jack aboard of her. I see things going,\nas I think, not quite right. And I ask you to take certain precautions\nor let me resign my berth. And that's all.”\n\n“Captain Smollett,” began the doctor with a smile, “did ever you hear\nthe fable of the mountain and the mouse? You'll excuse me, I dare say,\nbut you remind me of that fable. When you came in here, I'll stake my\nwig, you meant more than this.”\n\n“Doctor,” said the captain, “you are smart. When I came in here I meant\nto get discharged. I had no thought that Mr. Trelawney would hear a\nword.”\n\n“No more I would,” cried the squire. “Had Livesey not been here I should\nhave seen you to the deuce. As it is, I have heard you. I will do as you\ndesire, but I think the worse of you.”\n\n“That's as you please, sir,” said the captain. “You'll find I do my\nduty.”\n\nAnd with that he took his leave.\n\n“Trelawney,” said the doctor, “contrary to all my notions, I believed\nyou have managed to get two honest men on board with you--that man and\nJohn Silver.”\n\n“Silver, if you like,” cried the squire; “but as for that intolerable\nhumbug, I declare I think his conduct unmanly, unsailorly, and downright\nun-English.”\n\n“Well,” says the doctor, “we shall see.”\n\nWhen we came on deck, the men had begun already to take out the arms and\npowder, yo-ho-ing at their work, while the captain and Mr. Arrow stood\nby superintending.\n\nThe new arrangement was quite to my liking. The whole schooner had been\noverhauled; six berths had been made astern out of what had been the\nafter-part of the main hold; and this set of cabins was only joined to\nthe galley and forecastle by a sparred passage on the port side. It had\nbeen originally meant that the captain, Mr. Arrow, Hunter, Joyce, the\ndoctor, and the squire were to occupy these six berths. Now Redruth and\nI were to get two of them and Mr. Arrow and the captain were to sleep\non deck in the companion, which had been enlarged on each side till you\nmight almost have called it a round-house. Very low it was still, of\ncourse; but there was room to swing two hammocks, and even the mate\nseemed pleased with the arrangement. Even he, perhaps, had been doubtful\nas to the crew, but that is only guess, for as you shall hear, we had\nnot long the benefit of his opinion.\n\nWe were all hard at work, changing the powder and the berths, when\nthe last man or two, and Long John along with them, came off in a\nshore-boat.\n\nThe cook came up the side like a monkey for cleverness, and as soon as\nhe saw what was doing, “So ho, mates!” says he. “What's this?”\n\n“We're a-changing of the powder, Jack,” answers one.\n\n“Why, by the powers,” cried Long John, “if we do, we'll miss the morning\ntide!”\n\n“My orders!” said the captain shortly. “You may go below, my man. Hands\nwill want supper.”\n\n“Aye, aye, sir,” answered the cook, and touching his forelock, he\ndisappeared at once in the direction of his galley.\n\n“That's a good man, captain,” said the doctor.\n\n“Very likely, sir,” replied Captain Smollett. “Easy with that,\nmen--easy,” he ran on, to the fellows who were shifting the powder; and\nthen suddenly observing me examining the swivel we carried amidships,\na long brass nine, “Here you, ship's boy,” he cried, “out o' that! Off\nwith you to the cook and get some work.”\n\nAnd then as I was hurrying off I heard him say, quite loudly, to the\ndoctor, “I'll have no favourites on my ship.”\n\nI assure you I was quite of the squire's way of thinking, and hated the\ncaptain deeply.\n\n\n\n\n10\n\nThe Voyage\n\nALL that night we were in a great bustle getting things stowed in their\nplace, and boatfuls of the squire's friends, Mr. Blandly and the like,\ncoming off to wish him a good voyage and a safe return. We never had\na night at the Admiral Benbow when I had half the work; and I was\ndog-tired when, a little before dawn, the boatswain sounded his pipe\nand the crew began to man the capstan-bars. I might have been twice\nas weary, yet I would not have left the deck, all was so new and\ninteresting to me--the brief commands, the shrill note of the whistle,\nthe men bustling to their places in the glimmer of the ship's lanterns.\n\n“Now, Barbecue, tip us a stave,” cried one voice.\n\n“The old one,” cried another.\n\n“Aye, aye, mates,” said Long John, who was standing by, with his crutch\nunder his arm, and at once broke out in the air and words I knew so\nwell:\n\n“Fifteen men on the dead man's chest--”\n\nAnd then the whole crew bore chorus:--\n\n“Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!”\n\nAnd at the third “Ho!” drove the bars before them with a will.\n\nEven at that exciting moment it carried me back to the old Admiral\nBenbow in a second, and I seemed to hear the voice of the captain piping\nin the chorus. But soon the anchor was short up; soon it was hanging\ndripping at the bows; soon the sails began to draw, and the land and\nshipping to flit by on either side; and before I could lie down to\nsnatch an hour of slumber the HISPANIOLA had begun her voyage to the\nIsle of Treasure.\n\nI am not going to relate that voyage in detail. It was fairly\nprosperous. The ship proved to be a good ship, the crew were capable\nseamen, and the captain thoroughly understood his business. But before\nwe came the length of Treasure Island, two or three things had happened\nwhich require to be known.\n\nMr. Arrow, first of all, turned out even worse than the captain had\nfeared. He had no command among the men, and people did what they\npleased with him. But that was by no means the worst of it, for after a\nday or two at sea he began to appear on deck with hazy eye, red cheeks,\nstuttering tongue, and other marks of drunkenness. Time after time\nhe was ordered below in disgrace. Sometimes he fell and cut himself;\nsometimes he lay all day long in his little bunk at one side of the\ncompanion; sometimes for a day or two he would be almost sober and\nattend to his work at least passably.\n\nIn the meantime, we could never make out where he got the drink. That\nwas the ship's mystery. Watch him as we pleased, we could do nothing to\nsolve it; and when we asked him to his face, he would only laugh if\nhe were drunk, and if he were sober deny solemnly that he ever tasted\nanything but water.\n\nHe was not only useless as an officer and a bad influence amongst\nthe men, but it was plain that at this rate he must soon kill himself\noutright, so nobody was much surprised, nor very sorry, when one dark\nnight, with a head sea, he disappeared entirely and was seen no more.\n\n“Overboard!” said the captain. “Well, gentlemen, that saves the trouble\nof putting him in irons.”\n\nBut there we were, without a mate; and it was necessary, of course, to\nadvance one of the men. The boatswain, Job Anderson, was the likeliest\nman aboard, and though he kept his old title, he served in a way as\nmate. Mr. Trelawney had followed the sea, and his knowledge made him\nvery useful, for he often took a watch himself in easy weather. And the\ncoxswain, Israel Hands, was a careful, wily, old, experienced seaman who\ncould be trusted at a pinch with almost anything.\n\nHe was a great confidant of Long John Silver, and so the mention of\nhis name leads me on to speak of our ship's cook, Barbecue, as the men\ncalled him.\n\nAboard ship he carried his crutch by a lanyard round his neck, to have\nboth hands as free as possible. It was something to see him wedge the\nfoot of the crutch against a bulkhead, and propped against it, yielding\nto every movement of the ship, get on with his cooking like someone safe\nashore. Still more strange was it to see him in the heaviest of weather\ncross the deck. He had a line or two rigged up to help him across the\nwidest spaces--Long John's earrings, they were called; and he would hand\nhimself from one place to another, now using the crutch, now trailing it\nalongside by the lanyard, as quickly as another man could walk. Yet some\nof the men who had sailed with him before expressed their pity to see\nhim so reduced.\n\n“He's no common man, Barbecue,” said the coxswain to me. “He had good\nschooling in his young days and can speak like a book when so minded;\nand brave--a lion's nothing alongside of Long John! I seen him grapple\nfour and knock their heads together--him unarmed.”\n\nAll the crew respected and even obeyed him. He had a way of talking\nto each and doing everybody some particular service. To me he was\nunweariedly kind, and always glad to see me in the galley, which he kept\nas clean as a new pin, the dishes hanging up burnished and his parrot in\na cage in one corner.\n\n“Come away, Hawkins,” he would say; “come and have a yarn with John.\nNobody more welcome than yourself, my son. Sit you down and hear the\nnews. Here's Cap'n Flint--I calls my parrot Cap'n Flint, after the\nfamous buccaneer--here's Cap'n Flint predicting success to our v'yage.\nWasn't you, cap'n?”\n\nAnd the parrot would say, with great rapidity, “Pieces of eight! Pieces\nof eight! Pieces of eight!” till you wondered that it was not out of\nbreath, or till John threw his handkerchief over the cage.\n\n“Now, that bird,” he would say, “is, maybe, two hundred years\nold, Hawkins--they live forever mostly; and if anybody's seen more\nwickedness, it must be the devil himself. She's sailed with England,\nthe great Cap'n England, the pirate. She's been at Madagascar, and at\nMalabar, and Surinam, and Providence, and Portobello. She was at the\nfishing up of the wrecked plate ships. It's there she learned 'Pieces\nof eight,' and little wonder; three hundred and fifty thousand of 'em,\nHawkins! She was at the boarding of the viceroy of the Indies out of\nGoa, she was; and to look at her you would think she was a babby. But\nyou smelt powder--didn't you, cap'n?”\n\n“Stand by to go about,” the parrot would scream.\n\n“Ah, she's a handsome craft, she is,” the cook would say, and give her\nsugar from his pocket, and then the bird would peck at the bars and\nswear straight on, passing belief for wickedness. “There,” John would\nadd, “you can't touch pitch and not be mucked, lad. Here's this poor old\ninnocent bird o' mine swearing blue fire, and none the wiser, you may\nlay to that. She would swear the same, in a manner of speaking, before\nchaplain.” And John would touch his forelock with a solemn way he had\nthat made me think he was the best of men.\n\nIn the meantime, the squire and Captain Smollett were still on pretty\ndistant terms with one another. The squire made no bones about the\nmatter; he despised the captain. The captain, on his part, never spoke\nbut when he was spoken to, and then sharp and short and dry, and not a\nword wasted. He owned, when driven into a corner, that he seemed to have\nbeen wrong about the crew, that some of them were as brisk as he wanted\nto see and all had behaved fairly well. As for the ship, he had taken a\ndownright fancy to her. “She'll lie a point nearer the wind than a man\nhas a right to expect of his own married wife, sir. But,” he would add,\n“all I say is, we're not home again, and I don't like the cruise.”\n\nThe squire, at this, would turn away and march up and down the deck,\nchin in air.\n\n“A trifle more of that man,” he would say, “and I shall explode.”\n\nWe had some heavy weather, which only proved the qualities of the\nHISPANIOLA. Every man on board seemed well content, and they must have\nbeen hard to please if they had been otherwise, for it is my belief\nthere was never a ship's company so spoiled since Noah put to sea.\nDouble grog was going on the least excuse; there was duff on odd days,\nas, for instance, if the squire heard it was any man's birthday, and\nalways a barrel of apples standing broached in the waist for anyone to\nhelp himself that had a fancy.\n\n“Never knew good come of it yet,” the captain said to Dr. Livesey.\n“Spoil forecastle hands, make devils. That's my belief.”\n\nBut good did come of the apple barrel, as you shall hear, for if it had\nnot been for that, we should have had no note of warning and might all\nhave perished by the hand of treachery.\n\nThis was how it came about.\n\nWe had run up the trades to get the wind of the island we were after--I\nam not allowed to be more plain--and now we were running down for it\nwith a bright lookout day and night. It was about the last day of our\noutward voyage by the largest computation; some time that night, or at\nlatest before noon of the morrow, we should sight the Treasure Island.\nWe were heading S.S.W. and had a steady breeze abeam and a quiet sea.\nThe HISPANIOLA rolled steadily, dipping her bowsprit now and then with\na whiff of spray. All was drawing alow and aloft; everyone was in the\nbravest spirits because we were now so near an end of the first part of\nour adventure.\n\nNow, just after sundown, when all my work was over and I was on my way\nto my berth, it occurred to me that I should like an apple. I ran on\ndeck. The watch was all forward looking out for the island. The man at\nthe helm was watching the luff of the sail and whistling away gently\nto himself, and that was the only sound excepting the swish of the sea\nagainst the bows and around the sides of the ship.\n\nIn I got bodily into the apple barrel, and found there was scarce an\napple left; but sitting down there in the dark, what with the sound of\nthe waters and the rocking movement of the ship, I had either fallen\nasleep or was on the point of doing so when a heavy man sat down with\nrather a clash close by. The barrel shook as he leaned his shoulders\nagainst it, and I was just about to jump up when the man began to speak.\nIt was Silver's voice, and before I had heard a dozen words, I would\nnot have shown myself for all the world, but lay there, trembling and\nlistening, in the extreme of fear and curiosity, for from these dozen\nwords I understood that the lives of all the honest men aboard depended\nupon me alone.\n\n\n\n\n11\n\nWhat I Heard in the Apple Barrel\n\n“NO, not I,” said Silver. “Flint was cap'n; I was quartermaster, along\nof my timber leg. The same broadside I lost my leg, old Pew lost his\ndeadlights. It was a master surgeon, him that ampytated me--out of\ncollege and all--Latin by the bucket, and what not; but he was hanged\nlike a dog, and sun-dried like the rest, at Corso Castle. That\nwas Roberts' men, that was, and comed of changing names to their\nships--ROYAL FORTUNE and so on. Now, what a ship was christened, so let\nher stay, I says. So it was with the CASSANDRA, as brought us all safe\nhome from Malabar, after England took the viceroy of the Indies; so it\nwas with the old WALRUS, Flint's old ship, as I've seen amuck with the\nred blood and fit to sink with gold.”\n\n“Ah!” cried another voice, that of the youngest hand on board, and\nevidently full of admiration. “He was the flower of the flock, was\nFlint!”\n\n“Davis was a man too, by all accounts,” said Silver. “I never sailed\nalong of him; first with England, then with Flint, that's my story;\nand now here on my own account, in a manner of speaking. I laid by nine\nhundred safe, from England, and two thousand after Flint. That ain't bad\nfor a man before the mast--all safe in bank. 'Tain't earning now, it's\nsaving does it, you may lay to that. Where's all England's men now? I\ndunno. Where's Flint's? Why, most on 'em aboard here, and glad to get\nthe duff--been begging before that, some on 'em. Old Pew, as had lost\nhis sight, and might have thought shame, spends twelve hundred pound in\na year, like a lord in Parliament. Where is he now? Well, he's dead now\nand under hatches; but for two year before that, shiver my timbers,\nthe man was starving! He begged, and he stole, and he cut throats, and\nstarved at that, by the powers!”\n\n“Well, it ain't much use, after all,” said the young seaman.\n\n“'Tain't much use for fools, you may lay to it--that, nor nothing,”\n cried Silver. “But now, you look here: you're young, you are, but you're\nas smart as paint. I see that when I set my eyes on you, and I'll talk\nto you like a man.”\n\nYou may imagine how I felt when I heard this abominable old rogue\naddressing another in the very same words of flattery as he had used\nto myself. I think, if I had been able, that I would have killed\nhim through the barrel. Meantime, he ran on, little supposing he was\noverheard.\n\n“Here it is about gentlemen of fortune. They lives rough, and they risk\nswinging, but they eat and drink like fighting-cocks, and when a cruise\nis done, why, it's hundreds of pounds instead of hundreds of farthings\nin their pockets. Now, the most goes for rum and a good fling, and to\nsea again in their shirts. But that's not the course I lay. I puts it\nall away, some here, some there, and none too much anywheres, by reason\nof suspicion. I'm fifty, mark you; once back from this cruise, I set up\ngentleman in earnest. Time enough too, says you. Ah, but I've lived easy\nin the meantime, never denied myself o' nothing heart desires, and slep'\nsoft and ate dainty all my days but when at sea. And how did I begin?\nBefore the mast, like you!”\n\n“Well,” said the other, “but all the other money's gone now, ain't it?\nYou daren't show face in Bristol after this.”\n\n“Why, where might you suppose it was?” asked Silver derisively.\n\n“At Bristol, in banks and places,” answered his companion.\n\n“It were,” said the cook; “it were when we weighed anchor. But my old\nmissis has it all by now. And the Spy-glass is sold, lease and goodwill\nand rigging; and the old girl's off to meet me. I would tell you where,\nfor I trust you, but it'd make jealousy among the mates.”\n\n“And can you trust your missis?” asked the other.\n\n“Gentlemen of fortune,” returned the cook, “usually trusts little among\nthemselves, and right they are, you may lay to it. But I have a way with\nme, I have. When a mate brings a slip on his cable--one as knows me, I\nmean--it won't be in the same world with old John. There was some that\nwas feared of Pew, and some that was feared of Flint; but Flint his own\nself was feared of me. Feared he was, and proud. They was the roughest\ncrew afloat, was Flint's; the devil himself would have been feared to go\nto sea with them. Well now, I tell you, I'm not a boasting man, and you\nseen yourself how easy I keep company, but when I was quartermaster,\nLAMBS wasn't the word for Flint's old buccaneers. Ah, you may be sure of\nyourself in old John's ship.”\n\n“Well, I tell you now,” replied the lad, “I didn't half a quarter like\nthe job till I had this talk with you, John; but there's my hand on it\nnow.”\n\n“And a brave lad you were, and smart too,” answered Silver, shaking\nhands so heartily that all the barrel shook, “and a finer figurehead for\na gentleman of fortune I never clapped my eyes on.”\n\nBy this time I had begun to understand the meaning of their terms. By a\n“gentleman of fortune” they plainly meant neither more nor less than a\ncommon pirate, and the little scene that I had overheard was the last\nact in the corruption of one of the honest hands--perhaps of the last\none left aboard. But on this point I was soon to be relieved, for Silver\ngiving a little whistle, a third man strolled up and sat down by the\nparty.\n\n“Dick's square,” said Silver.\n\n“Oh, I know'd Dick was square,” returned the voice of the coxswain,\nIsrael Hands. “He's no fool, is Dick.” And he turned his quid and spat.\n“But look here,” he went on, “here's what I want to know, Barbecue: how\nlong are we a-going to stand off and on like a blessed bumboat? I've had\na'most enough o' Cap'n Smollett; he's hazed me long enough, by thunder!\nI want to go into that cabin, I do. I want their pickles and wines, and\nthat.”\n\n“Israel,” said Silver, “your head ain't much account, nor ever was. But\nyou're able to hear, I reckon; leastways, your ears is big enough.\nNow, here's what I say: you'll berth forward, and you'll live hard, and\nyou'll speak soft, and you'll keep sober till I give the word; and you\nmay lay to that, my son.”\n\n“Well, I don't say no, do I?” growled the coxswain. “What I say is,\nwhen? That's what I say.”\n\n“When! By the powers!” cried Silver. “Well now, if you want to know,\nI'll tell you when. The last moment I can manage, and that's when.\nHere's a first-rate seaman, Cap'n Smollett, sails the blessed ship for\nus. Here's this squire and doctor with a map and such--I don't know\nwhere it is, do I? No more do you, says you. Well then, I mean this\nsquire and doctor shall find the stuff, and help us to get it aboard,\nby the powers. Then we'll see. If I was sure of you all, sons of double\nDutchmen, I'd have Cap'n Smollett navigate us half-way back again before\nI struck.”\n\n“Why, we're all seamen aboard here, I should think,” said the lad Dick.\n\n“We're all forecastle hands, you mean,” snapped Silver. “We can steer\na course, but who's to set one? That's what all you gentlemen split on,\nfirst and last. If I had my way, I'd have Cap'n Smollett work us back\ninto the trades at least; then we'd have no blessed miscalculations and\na spoonful of water a day. But I know the sort you are. I'll finish with\n'em at the island, as soon's the blunt's on board, and a pity it is. But\nyou're never happy till you're drunk. Split my sides, I've a sick heart\nto sail with the likes of you!”\n\n“Easy all, Long John,” cried Israel. “Who's a-crossin' of you?”\n\n“Why, how many tall ships, think ye, now, have I seen laid aboard? And\nhow many brisk lads drying in the sun at Execution Dock?” cried Silver.\n“And all for this same hurry and hurry and hurry. You hear me? I seen\na thing or two at sea, I have. If you would on'y lay your course, and a\np'int to windward, you would ride in carriages, you would. But not you!\nI know you. You'll have your mouthful of rum tomorrow, and go hang.”\n\n“Everybody knowed you was a kind of a chapling, John; but there's others\nas could hand and steer as well as you,” said Israel. “They liked a bit\no' fun, they did. They wasn't so high and dry, nohow, but took their\nfling, like jolly companions every one.”\n\n“So?” says Silver. “Well, and where are they now? Pew was that sort,\nand he died a beggar-man. Flint was, and he died of rum at Savannah. Ah,\nthey was a sweet crew, they was! On'y, where are they?”\n\n“But,” asked Dick, “when we do lay 'em athwart, what are we to do with\n'em, anyhow?”\n\n“There's the man for me!” cried the cook admiringly. “That's what I call\nbusiness. Well, what would you think? Put 'em ashore like maroons? That\nwould have been England's way. Or cut 'em down like that much pork? That\nwould have been Flint's, or Billy Bones's.”\n\n“Billy was the man for that,” said Israel. “'Dead men don't bite,' says\nhe. Well, he's dead now hisself; he knows the long and short on it now;\nand if ever a rough hand come to port, it was Billy.”\n\n“Right you are,” said Silver; “rough and ready. But mark you here,\nI'm an easy man--I'm quite the gentleman, says you; but this time it's\nserious. Dooty is dooty, mates. I give my vote--death. When I'm in\nParlyment and riding in my coach, I don't want none of these sea-lawyers\nin the cabin a-coming home, unlooked for, like the devil at prayers.\nWait is what I say; but when the time comes, why, let her rip!”\n\n“John,” cries the coxswain, “you're a man!”\n\n“You'll say so, Israel when you see,” said Silver. “Only one thing I\nclaim--I claim Trelawney. I'll wring his calf's head off his body with\nthese hands, Dick!” he added, breaking off. “You just jump up, like a\nsweet lad, and get me an apple, to wet my pipe like.”\n\nYou may fancy the terror I was in! I should have leaped out and run for\nit if I had found the strength, but my limbs and heart alike misgave me.\nI heard Dick begin to rise, and then someone seemingly stopped him, and\nthe voice of Hands exclaimed, “Oh, stow that! Don't you get sucking of\nthat bilge, John. Let's have a go of the rum.”\n\n“Dick,” said Silver, “I trust you. I've a gauge on the keg, mind.\nThere's the key; you fill a pannikin and bring it up.”\n\nTerrified as I was, I could not help thinking to myself that this must\nhave been how Mr. Arrow got the strong waters that destroyed him.\n\nDick was gone but a little while, and during his absence Israel spoke\nstraight on in the cook's ear. It was but a word or two that I could\ncatch, and yet I gathered some important news, for besides other scraps\nthat tended to the same purpose, this whole clause was audible: “Not\nanother man of them'll jine.” Hence there were still faithful men on\nboard.\n\nWhen Dick returned, one after another of the trio took the pannikin and\ndrank--one “To luck,” another with a “Here's to old Flint,” and Silver\nhimself saying, in a kind of song, “Here's to ourselves, and hold your\nluff, plenty of prizes and plenty of duff.”\n\nJust then a sort of brightness fell upon me in the barrel, and looking\nup, I found the moon had risen and was silvering the mizzen-top and\nshining white on the luff of the fore-sail; and almost at the same time\nthe voice of the lookout shouted, “Land ho!”\n\n\n\n\n12\n\nCouncil of War\n\nTHERE was a great rush of feet across the deck. I could hear people\ntumbling up from the cabin and the forecastle, and slipping in an\ninstant outside my barrel, I dived behind the fore-sail, made a double\ntowards the stern, and came out upon the open deck in time to join\nHunter and Dr. Livesey in the rush for the weather bow.\n\nThere all hands were already congregated. A belt of fog had lifted\nalmost simultaneously with the appearance of the moon. Away to the\nsouth-west of us we saw two low hills, about a couple of miles apart,\nand rising behind one of them a third and higher hill, whose peak was\nstill buried in the fog. All three seemed sharp and conical in figure.\n\nSo much I saw, almost in a dream, for I had not yet recovered from my\nhorrid fear of a minute or two before. And then I heard the voice of\nCaptain Smollett issuing orders. The HISPANIOLA was laid a couple of\npoints nearer the wind and now sailed a course that would just clear the\nisland on the east.\n\n“And now, men,” said the captain, when all was sheeted home, “has any\none of you ever seen that land ahead?”\n\n“I have, sir,” said Silver. “I've watered there with a trader I was cook\nin.”\n\n“The anchorage is on the south, behind an islet, I fancy?” asked the\ncaptain.\n\n“Yes, sir; Skeleton Island they calls it. It were a main place for\npirates once, and a hand we had on board knowed all their names for it.\nThat hill to the nor'ard they calls the Fore-mast Hill; there are three\nhills in a row running south'ard--fore, main, and mizzen, sir. But the\nmain--that's the big un, with the cloud on it--they usually calls\nthe Spy-glass, by reason of a lookout they kept when they was in the\nanchorage cleaning, for it's there they cleaned their ships, sir, asking\nyour pardon.”\n\n“I have a chart here,” says Captain Smollett. “See if that's the place.”\n\nLong John's eyes burned in his head as he took the chart, but by the\nfresh look of the paper I knew he was doomed to disappointment. This\nwas not the map we found in Billy Bones's chest, but an accurate copy,\ncomplete in all things--names and heights and soundings--with the single\nexception of the red crosses and the written notes. Sharp as must have\nbeen his annoyance, Silver had the strength of mind to hide it.\n\n“Yes, sir,” said he, “this is the spot, to be sure, and very prettily\ndrawed out. Who might have done that, I wonder? The pirates were too\nignorant, I reckon. Aye, here it is: 'Capt. Kidd's Anchorage'--just\nthe name my shipmate called it. There's a strong current runs along the\nsouth, and then away nor'ard up the west coast. Right you was, sir,”\n says he, “to haul your wind and keep the weather of the island.\nLeastways, if such was your intention as to enter and careen, and there\nain't no better place for that in these waters.”\n\n“Thank you, my man,” says Captain Smollett. “I'll ask you later on to\ngive us a help. You may go.”\n\nI was surprised at the coolness with which John avowed his knowledge\nof the island, and I own I was half-frightened when I saw him drawing\nnearer to myself. He did not know, to be sure, that I had overheard his\ncouncil from the apple barrel, and yet I had by this time taken such a\nhorror of his cruelty, duplicity, and power that I could scarce conceal\na shudder when he laid his hand upon my arm.\n\n“Ah,” says he, “this here is a sweet spot, this island--a sweet spot for\na lad to get ashore on. You'll bathe, and you'll climb trees, and you'll\nhunt goats, you will; and you'll get aloft on them hills like a goat\nyourself. Why, it makes me young again. I was going to forget my timber\nleg, I was. It's a pleasant thing to be young and have ten toes, and you\nmay lay to that. When you want to go a bit of exploring, you just ask\nold John, and he'll put up a snack for you to take along.”\n\nAnd clapping me in the friendliest way upon the shoulder, he hobbled off\nforward and went below.\n\nCaptain Smollett, the squire, and Dr. Livesey were talking together on\nthe quarter-deck, and anxious as I was to tell them my story, I durst\nnot interrupt them openly. While I was still casting about in my\nthoughts to find some probable excuse, Dr. Livesey called me to his\nside. He had left his pipe below, and being a slave to tobacco, had\nmeant that I should fetch it; but as soon as I was near enough to speak\nand not to be overheard, I broke immediately, “Doctor, let me speak. Get\nthe captain and squire down to the cabin, and then make some pretence to\nsend for me. I have terrible news.”\n\nThe doctor changed countenance a little, but next moment he was master\nof himself.\n\n“Thank you, Jim,” said he quite loudly, “that was all I wanted to know,”\n as if he had asked me a question.\n\nAnd with that he turned on his heel and rejoined the other two. They\nspoke together for a little, and though none of them started, or raised\nhis voice, or so much as whistled, it was plain enough that Dr. Livesey\nhad communicated my request, for the next thing that I heard was the\ncaptain giving an order to Job Anderson, and all hands were piped on\ndeck.\n\n“My lads,” said Captain Smollett, “I've a word to say to you. This\nland that we have sighted is the place we have been sailing for. Mr.\nTrelawney, being a very open-handed gentleman, as we all know, has just\nasked me a word or two, and as I was able to tell him that every man on\nboard had done his duty, alow and aloft, as I never ask to see it done\nbetter, why, he and I and the doctor are going below to the cabin to\ndrink YOUR health and luck, and you'll have grog served out for you to\ndrink OUR health and luck. I'll tell you what I think of this: I think\nit handsome. And if you think as I do, you'll give a good sea-cheer for\nthe gentleman that does it.”\n\nThe cheer followed--that was a matter of course; but it rang out so full\nand hearty that I confess I could hardly believe these same men were\nplotting for our blood.\n\n“One more cheer for Cap'n Smollett,” cried Long John when the first had\nsubsided.\n\nAnd this also was given with a will.\n\nOn the top of that the three gentlemen went below, and not long after,\nword was sent forward that Jim Hawkins was wanted in the cabin.\n\nI found them all three seated round the table, a bottle of Spanish wine\nand some raisins before them, and the doctor smoking away, with his wig\non his lap, and that, I knew, was a sign that he was agitated. The stern\nwindow was open, for it was a warm night, and you could see the moon\nshining behind on the ship's wake.\n\n“Now, Hawkins,” said the squire, “you have something to say. Speak up.”\n\nI did as I was bid, and as short as I could make it, told the whole\ndetails of Silver's conversation. Nobody interrupted me till I was done,\nnor did any one of the three of them make so much as a movement, but\nthey kept their eyes upon my face from first to last.\n\n“Jim,” said Dr. Livesey, “take a seat.”\n\nAnd they made me sit down at table beside them, poured me out a glass of\nwine, filled my hands with raisins, and all three, one after the other,\nand each with a bow, drank my good health, and their service to me, for\nmy luck and courage.\n\n“Now, captain,” said the squire, “you were right, and I was wrong. I own\nmyself an ass, and I await your orders.”\n\n“No more an ass than I, sir,” returned the captain. “I never heard of a\ncrew that meant to mutiny but what showed signs before, for any man that\nhad an eye in his head to see the mischief and take steps according. But\nthis crew,” he added, “beats me.”\n\n“Captain,” said the doctor, “with your permission, that's Silver. A very\nremarkable man.”\n\n“He'd look remarkably well from a yard-arm, sir,” returned the captain.\n“But this is talk; this don't lead to anything. I see three or four\npoints, and with Mr. Trelawney's permission, I'll name them.”\n\n“You, sir, are the captain. It is for you to speak,” says Mr. Trelawney\ngrandly.\n\n“First point,” began Mr. Smollett. “We must go on, because we can't turn\nback. If I gave the word to go about, they would rise at once. Second\npoint, we have time before us--at least until this treasure's found.\nThird point, there are faithful hands. Now, sir, it's got to come\nto blows sooner or later, and what I propose is to take time by the\nforelock, as the saying is, and come to blows some fine day when they\nleast expect it. We can count, I take it, on your own home servants, Mr.\nTrelawney?”\n\n“As upon myself,” declared the squire.\n\n“Three,” reckoned the captain; “ourselves make seven, counting Hawkins\nhere. Now, about the honest hands?”\n\n“Most likely Trelawney's own men,” said the doctor; “those he had picked\nup for himself before he lit on Silver.”\n\n“Nay,” replied the squire. “Hands was one of mine.”\n\n“I did think I could have trusted Hands,” added the captain.\n\n“And to think that they're all Englishmen!” broke out the squire. “Sir,\nI could find it in my heart to blow the ship up.”\n\n“Well, gentlemen,” said the captain, “the best that I can say is not\nmuch. We must lay to, if you please, and keep a bright lookout. It's\ntrying on a man, I know. It would be pleasanter to come to blows. But\nthere's no help for it till we know our men. Lay to, and whistle for a\nwind, that's my view.”\n\n“Jim here,” said the doctor, “can help us more than anyone. The men are\nnot shy with him, and Jim is a noticing lad.”\n\n“Hawkins, I put prodigious faith in you,” added the squire.\n\nI began to feel pretty desperate at this, for I felt altogether\nhelpless; and yet, by an odd train of circumstances, it was indeed\nthrough me that safety came. In the meantime, talk as we pleased, there\nwere only seven out of the twenty-six on whom we knew we could rely; and\nout of these seven one was a boy, so that the grown men on our side were\nsix to their nineteen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPART THREE--My Shore Adventure\n\n\n\n\n13\n\nHow My Shore Adventure Began\n\nTHE appearance of the island when I came on deck next morning was\naltogether changed. Although the breeze had now utterly ceased, we had\nmade a great deal of way during the night and were now lying becalmed\nabout half a mile to the south-east of the low eastern coast.\nGrey-coloured woods covered a large part of the surface. This even tint\nwas indeed broken up by streaks of yellow sand-break in the lower lands,\nand by many tall trees of the pine family, out-topping the others--some\nsingly, some in clumps; but the general colouring was uniform and sad.\nThe hills ran up clear above the vegetation in spires of naked rock.\nAll were strangely shaped, and the Spy-glass, which was by three or four\nhundred feet the tallest on the island, was likewise the strangest in\nconfiguration, running up sheer from almost every side and then suddenly\ncut off at the top like a pedestal to put a statue on.\n\nThe HISPANIOLA was rolling scuppers under in the ocean swell. The booms\nwere tearing at the blocks, the rudder was banging to and fro, and the\nwhole ship creaking, groaning, and jumping like a manufactory. I had\nto cling tight to the backstay, and the world turned giddily before my\neyes, for though I was a good enough sailor when there was way on, this\nstanding still and being rolled about like a bottle was a thing I never\nlearned to stand without a qualm or so, above all in the morning, on an\nempty stomach.\n\nPerhaps it was this--perhaps it was the look of the island, with its\ngrey, melancholy woods, and wild stone spires, and the surf that we\ncould both see and hear foaming and thundering on the steep beach--at\nleast, although the sun shone bright and hot, and the shore birds were\nfishing and crying all around us, and you would have thought anyone\nwould have been glad to get to land after being so long at sea, my heart\nsank, as the saying is, into my boots; and from the first look onward, I\nhated the very thought of Treasure Island.\n\nWe had a dreary morning's work before us, for there was no sign of any\nwind, and the boats had to be got out and manned, and the ship warped\nthree or four miles round the corner of the island and up the narrow\npassage to the haven behind Skeleton Island. I volunteered for one of\nthe boats, where I had, of course, no business. The heat was sweltering,\nand the men grumbled fiercely over their work. Anderson was in command\nof my boat, and instead of keeping the crew in order, he grumbled as\nloud as the worst.\n\n“Well,” he said with an oath, “it's not forever.”\n\nI thought this was a very bad sign, for up to that day the men had gone\nbriskly and willingly about their business; but the very sight of the\nisland had relaxed the cords of discipline.\n\nAll the way in, Long John stood by the steersman and conned the ship.\nHe knew the passage like the palm of his hand, and though the man in the\nchains got everywhere more water than was down in the chart, John never\nhesitated once.\n\n“There's a strong scour with the ebb,” he said, “and this here passage\nhas been dug out, in a manner of speaking, with a spade.”\n\nWe brought up just where the anchor was in the chart, about a third of\na mile from each shore, the mainland on one side and Skeleton Island on\nthe other. The bottom was clean sand. The plunge of our anchor sent up\nclouds of birds wheeling and crying over the woods, but in less than a\nminute they were down again and all was once more silent.\n\nThe place was entirely land-locked, buried in woods, the trees coming\nright down to high-water mark, the shores mostly flat, and the hilltops\nstanding round at a distance in a sort of amphitheatre, one here, one\nthere. Two little rivers, or rather two swamps, emptied out into this\npond, as you might call it; and the foliage round that part of the shore\nhad a kind of poisonous brightness. From the ship we could see nothing\nof the house or stockade, for they were quite buried among trees; and if\nit had not been for the chart on the companion, we might have been the\nfirst that had ever anchored there since the island arose out of the\nseas.\n\nThere was not a breath of air moving, nor a sound but that of the\nsurf booming half a mile away along the beaches and against the rocks\noutside. A peculiar stagnant smell hung over the anchorage--a smell of\nsodden leaves and rotting tree trunks. I observed the doctor sniffing\nand sniffing, like someone tasting a bad egg.\n\n“I don't know about treasure,” he said, “but I'll stake my wig there's\nfever here.”\n\nIf the conduct of the men had been alarming in the boat, it became truly\nthreatening when they had come aboard. They lay about the deck growling\ntogether in talk. The slightest order was received with a black look and\ngrudgingly and carelessly obeyed. Even the honest hands must have caught\nthe infection, for there was not one man aboard to mend another. Mutiny,\nit was plain, hung over us like a thunder-cloud.\n\nAnd it was not only we of the cabin party who perceived the danger. Long\nJohn was hard at work going from group to group, spending himself in\ngood advice, and as for example no man could have shown a better. He\nfairly outstripped himself in willingness and civility; he was all\nsmiles to everyone. If an order were given, John would be on his crutch\nin an instant, with the cheeriest “Aye, aye, sir!” in the world; and\nwhen there was nothing else to do, he kept up one song after another, as\nif to conceal the discontent of the rest.\n\nOf all the gloomy features of that gloomy afternoon, this obvious\nanxiety on the part of Long John appeared the worst.\n\nWe held a council in the cabin.\n\n“Sir,” said the captain, “if I risk another order, the whole ship'll\ncome about our ears by the run. You see, sir, here it is. I get a rough\nanswer, do I not? Well, if I speak back, pikes will be going in two\nshakes; if I don't, Silver will see there's something under that, and\nthe game's up. Now, we've only one man to rely on.”\n\n“And who is that?” asked the squire.\n\n“Silver, sir,” returned the captain; “he's as anxious as you and I to\nsmother things up. This is a tiff; he'd soon talk 'em out of it if he\nhad the chance, and what I propose to do is to give him the chance.\nLet's allow the men an afternoon ashore. If they all go, why we'll fight\nthe ship. If they none of them go, well then, we hold the cabin, and God\ndefend the right. If some go, you mark my words, sir, Silver'll bring\n'em aboard again as mild as lambs.”\n\nIt was so decided; loaded pistols were served out to all the sure men;\nHunter, Joyce, and Redruth were taken into our confidence and received\nthe news with less surprise and a better spirit than we had looked for,\nand then the captain went on deck and addressed the crew.\n\n“My lads,” said he, “we've had a hot day and are all tired and out of\nsorts. A turn ashore'll hurt nobody--the boats are still in the water;\nyou can take the gigs, and as many as please may go ashore for the\nafternoon. I'll fire a gun half an hour before sundown.”\n\nI believe the silly fellows must have thought they would break their\nshins over treasure as soon as they were landed, for they all came out\nof their sulks in a moment and gave a cheer that started the echo in a\nfaraway hill and sent the birds once more flying and squalling round the\nanchorage.\n\nThe captain was too bright to be in the way. He whipped out of sight\nin a moment, leaving Silver to arrange the party, and I fancy it was as\nwell he did so. Had he been on deck, he could no longer so much as\nhave pretended not to understand the situation. It was as plain as day.\nSilver was the captain, and a mighty rebellious crew he had of it. The\nhonest hands--and I was soon to see it proved that there were such on\nboard--must have been very stupid fellows. Or rather, I suppose the\ntruth was this, that all hands were disaffected by the example of the\nringleaders--only some more, some less; and a few, being good fellows in\nthe main, could neither be led nor driven any further. It is one thing\nto be idle and skulk and quite another to take a ship and murder a\nnumber of innocent men.\n\nAt last, however, the party was made up. Six fellows were to stay on\nboard, and the remaining thirteen, including Silver, began to embark.\n\nThen it was that there came into my head the first of the mad notions\nthat contributed so much to save our lives. If six men were left by\nSilver, it was plain our party could not take and fight the ship; and\nsince only six were left, it was equally plain that the cabin party\nhad no present need of my assistance. It occurred to me at once to go\nashore. In a jiffy I had slipped over the side and curled up in the\nfore-sheets of the nearest boat, and almost at the same moment she\nshoved off.\n\nNo one took notice of me, only the bow oar saying, “Is that you, Jim?\nKeep your head down.” But Silver, from the other boat, looked sharply\nover and called out to know if that were me; and from that moment I\nbegan to regret what I had done.\n\nThe crews raced for the beach, but the boat I was in, having some start\nand being at once the lighter and the better manned, shot far ahead of\nher consort, and the bow had struck among the shore-side trees and I\nhad caught a branch and swung myself out and plunged into the nearest\nthicket while Silver and the rest were still a hundred yards behind.\n\n“Jim, Jim!” I heard him shouting.\n\nBut you may suppose I paid no heed; jumping, ducking, and breaking\nthrough, I ran straight before my nose till I could run no longer.\n\n\n\n\n14\n\nThe First Blow\n\nI WAS so pleased at having given the slip to Long John that I began to\nenjoy myself and look around me with some interest on the strange land\nthat I was in.\n\nI had crossed a marshy tract full of willows, bulrushes, and odd,\noutlandish, swampy trees; and I had now come out upon the skirts of an\nopen piece of undulating, sandy country, about a mile long, dotted with\na few pines and a great number of contorted trees, not unlike the oak\nin growth, but pale in the foliage, like willows. On the far side of\nthe open stood one of the hills, with two quaint, craggy peaks shining\nvividly in the sun.\n\nI now felt for the first time the joy of exploration. The isle was\nuninhabited; my shipmates I had left behind, and nothing lived in front\nof me but dumb brutes and fowls. I turned hither and thither among the\ntrees. Here and there were flowering plants, unknown to me; here and\nthere I saw snakes, and one raised his head from a ledge of rock and\nhissed at me with a noise not unlike the spinning of a top. Little did\nI suppose that he was a deadly enemy and that the noise was the famous\nrattle.\n\nThen I came to a long thicket of these oaklike trees--live, or\nevergreen, oaks, I heard afterwards they should be called--which grew\nlow along the sand like brambles, the boughs curiously twisted, the\nfoliage compact, like thatch. The thicket stretched down from the top of\none of the sandy knolls, spreading and growing taller as it went, until\nit reached the margin of the broad, reedy fen, through which the nearest\nof the little rivers soaked its way into the anchorage. The marsh was\nsteaming in the strong sun, and the outline of the Spy-glass trembled\nthrough the haze.\n\nAll at once there began to go a sort of bustle among the bulrushes;\na wild duck flew up with a quack, another followed, and soon over the\nwhole surface of the marsh a great cloud of birds hung screaming and\ncircling in the air. I judged at once that some of my shipmates must be\ndrawing near along the borders of the fen. Nor was I deceived, for soon\nI heard the very distant and low tones of a human voice, which, as I\ncontinued to give ear, grew steadily louder and nearer.\n\nThis put me in a great fear, and I crawled under cover of the nearest\nlive-oak and squatted there, hearkening, as silent as a mouse.\n\nAnother voice answered, and then the first voice, which I now recognized\nto be Silver's, once more took up the story and ran on for a long while\nin a stream, only now and again interrupted by the other. By the sound\nthey must have been talking earnestly, and almost fiercely; but no\ndistinct word came to my hearing.\n\nAt last the speakers seemed to have paused and perhaps to have sat down,\nfor not only did they cease to draw any nearer, but the birds themselves\nbegan to grow more quiet and to settle again to their places in the\nswamp.\n\nAnd now I began to feel that I was neglecting my business, that since\nI had been so foolhardy as to come ashore with these desperadoes, the\nleast I could do was to overhear them at their councils, and that my\nplain and obvious duty was to draw as close as I could manage, under the\nfavourable ambush of the crouching trees.\n\nI could tell the direction of the speakers pretty exactly, not only by\nthe sound of their voices but by the behaviour of the few birds that\nstill hung in alarm above the heads of the intruders.\n\nCrawling on all fours, I made steadily but slowly towards them, till at\nlast, raising my head to an aperture among the leaves, I could see clear\ndown into a little green dell beside the marsh, and closely set about\nwith trees, where Long John Silver and another of the crew stood face to\nface in conversation.\n\nThe sun beat full upon them. Silver had thrown his hat beside him on the\nground, and his great, smooth, blond face, all shining with heat, was\nlifted to the other man's in a kind of appeal.\n\n“Mate,” he was saying, “it's because I thinks gold dust of you--gold\ndust, and you may lay to that! If I hadn't took to you like pitch, do\nyou think I'd have been here a-warning of you? All's up--you can't make\nnor mend; it's to save your neck that I'm a-speaking, and if one of the\nwild uns knew it, where'd I be, Tom--now, tell me, where'd I be?”\n\n“Silver,” said the other man--and I observed he was not only red in the\nface, but spoke as hoarse as a crow, and his voice shook too, like a\ntaut rope--“Silver,” says he, “you're old, and you're honest, or has the\nname for it; and you've money too, which lots of poor sailors hasn't;\nand you're brave, or I'm mistook. And will you tell me you'll let\nyourself be led away with that kind of a mess of swabs? Not you! As sure\nas God sees me, I'd sooner lose my hand. If I turn agin my dooty--”\n\nAnd then all of a sudden he was interrupted by a noise. I had found\none of the honest hands--well, here, at that same moment, came news of\nanother. Far away out in the marsh there arose, all of a sudden, a sound\nlike the cry of anger, then another on the back of it; and then one\nhorrid, long-drawn scream. The rocks of the Spy-glass re-echoed it a\nscore of times; the whole troop of marsh-birds rose again, darkening\nheaven, with a simultaneous whirr; and long after that death yell was\nstill ringing in my brain, silence had re-established its empire, and\nonly the rustle of the redescending birds and the boom of the distant\nsurges disturbed the languor of the afternoon.\n\nTom had leaped at the sound, like a horse at the spur, but Silver had\nnot winked an eye. He stood where he was, resting lightly on his crutch,\nwatching his companion like a snake about to spring.\n\n“John!” said the sailor, stretching out his hand.\n\n“Hands off!” cried Silver, leaping back a yard, as it seemed to me, with\nthe speed and security of a trained gymnast.\n\n“Hands off, if you like, John Silver,” said the other. “It's a black\nconscience that can make you feared of me. But in heaven's name, tell\nme, what was that?”\n\n“That?” returned Silver, smiling away, but warier than ever, his eye\na mere pin-point in his big face, but gleaming like a crumb of glass.\n“That? Oh, I reckon that'll be Alan.”\n\nAnd at this point Tom flashed out like a hero.\n\n“Alan!” he cried. “Then rest his soul for a true seaman! And as for you,\nJohn Silver, long you've been a mate of mine, but you're mate of mine\nno more. If I die like a dog, I'll die in my dooty. You've killed Alan,\nhave you? Kill me too, if you can. But I defies you.”\n\nAnd with that, this brave fellow turned his back directly on the cook\nand set off walking for the beach. But he was not destined to go far.\nWith a cry John seized the branch of a tree, whipped the crutch out of\nhis armpit, and sent that uncouth missile hurtling through the air.\nIt struck poor Tom, point foremost, and with stunning violence, right\nbetween the shoulders in the middle of his back. His hands flew up, he\ngave a sort of gasp, and fell.\n\nWhether he were injured much or little, none could ever tell. Like\nenough, to judge from the sound, his back was broken on the spot. But he\nhad no time given him to recover. Silver, agile as a monkey even without\nleg or crutch, was on the top of him next moment and had twice buried\nhis knife up to the hilt in that defenceless body. From my place of\nambush, I could hear him pant aloud as he struck the blows.\n\nI do not know what it rightly is to faint, but I do know that for the\nnext little while the whole world swam away from before me in a whirling\nmist; Silver and the birds, and the tall Spy-glass hilltop, going\nround and round and topsy-turvy before my eyes, and all manner of bells\nringing and distant voices shouting in my ear.\n\nWhen I came again to myself the monster had pulled himself together,\nhis crutch under his arm, his hat upon his head. Just before him Tom\nlay motionless upon the sward; but the murderer minded him not a whit,\ncleansing his blood-stained knife the while upon a wisp of grass.\nEverything else was unchanged, the sun still shining mercilessly on the\nsteaming marsh and the tall pinnacle of the mountain, and I could scarce\npersuade myself that murder had been actually done and a human life\ncruelly cut short a moment since before my eyes.\n\nBut now John put his hand into his pocket, brought out a whistle, and\nblew upon it several modulated blasts that rang far across the heated\nair. I could not tell, of course, the meaning of the signal, but\nit instantly awoke my fears. More men would be coming. I might be\ndiscovered. They had already slain two of the honest people; after Tom\nand Alan, might not I come next?\n\nInstantly I began to extricate myself and crawl back again, with what\nspeed and silence I could manage, to the more open portion of the\nwood. As I did so, I could hear hails coming and going between the old\nbuccaneer and his comrades, and this sound of danger lent me wings. As\nsoon as I was clear of the thicket, I ran as I never ran before, scarce\nminding the direction of my flight, so long as it led me from the\nmurderers; and as I ran, fear grew and grew upon me until it turned into\na kind of frenzy.\n\nIndeed, could anyone be more entirely lost than I? When the gun fired,\nhow should I dare to go down to the boats among those fiends, still\nsmoking from their crime? Would not the first of them who saw me wring\nmy neck like a snipe's? Would not my absence itself be an evidence to\nthem of my alarm, and therefore of my fatal knowledge? It was all over,\nI thought. Good-bye to the HISPANIOLA; good-bye to the squire, the\ndoctor, and the captain! There was nothing left for me but death by\nstarvation or death by the hands of the mutineers.\n\nAll this while, as I say, I was still running, and without taking any\nnotice, I had drawn near to the foot of the little hill with the two\npeaks and had got into a part of the island where the live-oaks grew\nmore widely apart and seemed more like forest trees in their bearing and\ndimensions. Mingled with these were a few scattered pines, some fifty,\nsome nearer seventy, feet high. The air too smelt more freshly than down\nbeside the marsh.\n\nAnd here a fresh alarm brought me to a standstill with a thumping heart.\n\n\n\n\n15\n\nThe Man of the Island\n\nFROM the side of the hill, which was here steep and stony, a spout of\ngravel was dislodged and fell rattling and bounding through the trees.\nMy eyes turned instinctively in that direction, and I saw a figure leap\nwith great rapidity behind the trunk of a pine. What it was, whether\nbear or man or monkey, I could in no wise tell. It seemed dark and\nshaggy; more I knew not. But the terror of this new apparition brought\nme to a stand.\n\nI was now, it seemed, cut off upon both sides; behind me the murderers,\nbefore me this lurking nondescript. And immediately I began to prefer\nthe dangers that I knew to those I knew not. Silver himself appeared\nless terrible in contrast with this creature of the woods, and I turned\non my heel, and looking sharply behind me over my shoulder, began to\nretrace my steps in the direction of the boats.\n\nInstantly the figure reappeared, and making a wide circuit, began to\nhead me off. I was tired, at any rate; but had I been as fresh as when I\nrose, I could see it was in vain for me to contend in speed with such an\nadversary. From trunk to trunk the creature flitted like a deer, running\nmanlike on two legs, but unlike any man that I had ever seen, stooping\nalmost double as it ran. Yet a man it was, I could no longer be in doubt\nabout that.\n\nI began to recall what I had heard of cannibals. I was within an ace of\ncalling for help. But the mere fact that he was a man, however wild,\nhad somewhat reassured me, and my fear of Silver began to revive in\nproportion. I stood still, therefore, and cast about for some method of\nescape; and as I was so thinking, the recollection of my pistol flashed\ninto my mind. As soon as I remembered I was not defenceless, courage\nglowed again in my heart and I set my face resolutely for this man of\nthe island and walked briskly towards him.\n\nHe was concealed by this time behind another tree trunk; but he must\nhave been watching me closely, for as soon as I began to move in his\ndirection he reappeared and took a step to meet me. Then he hesitated,\ndrew back, came forward again, and at last, to my wonder and\nconfusion, threw himself on his knees and held out his clasped hands in\nsupplication.\n\nAt that I once more stopped.\n\n“Who are you?” I asked.\n\n“Ben Gunn,” he answered, and his voice sounded hoarse and awkward,\nlike a rusty lock. “I'm poor Ben Gunn, I am; and I haven't spoke with a\nChristian these three years.”\n\nI could now see that he was a white man like myself and that his\nfeatures were even pleasing. His skin, wherever it was exposed, was\nburnt by the sun; even his lips were black, and his fair eyes looked\nquite startling in so dark a face. Of all the beggar-men that I had seen\nor fancied, he was the chief for raggedness. He was clothed with tatters\nof old ship's canvas and old sea-cloth, and this extraordinary patchwork\nwas all held together by a system of the most various and incongruous\nfastenings, brass buttons, bits of stick, and loops of tarry gaskin.\nAbout his waist he wore an old brass-buckled leather belt, which was the\none thing solid in his whole accoutrement.\n\n“Three years!” I cried. “Were you shipwrecked?”\n\n“Nay, mate,” said he; “marooned.”\n\nI had heard the word, and I knew it stood for a horrible kind of\npunishment common enough among the buccaneers, in which the offender\nis put ashore with a little powder and shot and left behind on some\ndesolate and distant island.\n\n“Marooned three years agone,” he continued, “and lived on goats since\nthen, and berries, and oysters. Wherever a man is, says I, a man can\ndo for himself. But, mate, my heart is sore for Christian diet. You\nmightn't happen to have a piece of cheese about you, now? No? Well,\nmany's the long night I've dreamed of cheese--toasted, mostly--and woke\nup again, and here I were.”\n\n“If ever I can get aboard again,” said I, “you shall have cheese by the\nstone.”\n\nAll this time he had been feeling the stuff of my jacket, smoothing\nmy hands, looking at my boots, and generally, in the intervals of\nhis speech, showing a childish pleasure in the presence of a fellow\ncreature. But at my last words he perked up into a kind of startled\nslyness.\n\n“If ever you can get aboard again, says you?” he repeated. “Why, now,\nwho's to hinder you?”\n\n“Not you, I know,” was my reply.\n\n“And right you was,” he cried. “Now you--what do you call yourself,\nmate?”\n\n“Jim,” I told him.\n\n“Jim, Jim,” says he, quite pleased apparently. “Well, now, Jim, I've\nlived that rough as you'd be ashamed to hear of. Now, for instance, you\nwouldn't think I had had a pious mother--to look at me?” he asked.\n\n“Why, no, not in particular,” I answered.\n\n“Ah, well,” said he, “but I had--remarkable pious. And I was a civil,\npious boy, and could rattle off my catechism that fast, as you couldn't\ntell one word from another. And here's what it come to, Jim, and it\nbegun with chuck-farthen on the blessed grave-stones! That's what it\nbegun with, but it went further'n that; and so my mother told me, and\npredicked the whole, she did, the pious woman! But it were Providence\nthat put me here. I've thought it all out in this here lonely island,\nand I'm back on piety. You don't catch me tasting rum so much, but just\na thimbleful for luck, of course, the first chance I have. I'm bound\nI'll be good, and I see the way to. And, Jim”--looking all round him and\nlowering his voice to a whisper--“I'm rich.”\n\nI now felt sure that the poor fellow had gone crazy in his solitude, and\nI suppose I must have shown the feeling in my face, for he repeated the\nstatement hotly: “Rich! Rich! I says. And I'll tell you what: I'll make\na man of you, Jim. Ah, Jim, you'll bless your stars, you will, you was\nthe first that found me!”\n\nAnd at this there came suddenly a lowering shadow over his face, and he\ntightened his grasp upon my hand and raised a forefinger threateningly\nbefore my eyes.\n\n“Now, Jim, you tell me true: that ain't Flint's ship?” he asked.\n\nAt this I had a happy inspiration. I began to believe that I had found\nan ally, and I answered him at once.\n\n“It's not Flint's ship, and Flint is dead; but I'll tell you true, as\nyou ask me--there are some of Flint's hands aboard; worse luck for the\nrest of us.”\n\n“Not a man--with one--leg?” he gasped.\n\n“Silver?” I asked.\n\n“Ah, Silver!” says he. “That were his name.”\n\n“He's the cook, and the ringleader too.”\n\nHe was still holding me by the wrist, and at that he give it quite a\nwring.\n\n“If you was sent by Long John,” he said, “I'm as good as pork, and I\nknow it. But where was you, do you suppose?”\n\nI had made my mind up in a moment, and by way of answer told him\nthe whole story of our voyage and the predicament in which we found\nourselves. He heard me with the keenest interest, and when I had done he\npatted me on the head.\n\n“You're a good lad, Jim,” he said; “and you're all in a clove hitch,\nain't you? Well, you just put your trust in Ben Gunn--Ben Gunn's the man\nto do it. Would you think it likely, now, that your squire would prove\na liberal-minded one in case of help--him being in a clove hitch, as you\nremark?”\n\nI told him the squire was the most liberal of men.\n\n“Aye, but you see,” returned Ben Gunn, “I didn't mean giving me a gate\nto keep, and a suit of livery clothes, and such; that's not my mark,\nJim. What I mean is, would he be likely to come down to the toon of, say\none thousand pounds out of money that's as good as a man's own already?”\n\n“I am sure he would,” said I. “As it was, all hands were to share.”\n\n“AND a passage home?” he added with a look of great shrewdness.\n\n“Why,” I cried, “the squire's a gentleman. And besides, if we got rid of\nthe others, we should want you to help work the vessel home.”\n\n“Ah,” said he, “so you would.” And he seemed very much relieved.\n\n“Now, I'll tell you what,” he went on. “So much I'll tell you, and no\nmore. I were in Flint's ship when he buried the treasure; he and\nsix along--six strong seamen. They was ashore nigh on a week, and us\nstanding off and on in the old WALRUS. One fine day up went the signal,\nand here come Flint by himself in a little boat, and his head done up in\na blue scarf. The sun was getting up, and mortal white he looked about\nthe cutwater. But, there he was, you mind, and the six all dead--dead\nand buried. How he done it, not a man aboard us could make out. It was\nbattle, murder, and sudden death, leastways--him against six. Billy\nBones was the mate; Long John, he was quartermaster; and they asked him\nwhere the treasure was. 'Ah,' says he, 'you can go ashore, if you like,\nand stay,' he says; 'but as for the ship, she'll beat up for more, by\nthunder!' That's what he said.\n\n“Well, I was in another ship three years back, and we sighted this\nisland. 'Boys,' said I, 'here's Flint's treasure; let's land and find\nit.' The cap'n was displeased at that, but my messmates were all of a\nmind and landed. Twelve days they looked for it, and every day they had\nthe worse word for me, until one fine morning all hands went aboard. 'As\nfor you, Benjamin Gunn,' says they, 'here's a musket,' they says, 'and\na spade, and pick-axe. You can stay here and find Flint's money for\nyourself,' they says.\n\n“Well, Jim, three years have I been here, and not a bite of Christian\ndiet from that day to this. But now, you look here; look at me. Do I\nlook like a man before the mast? No, says you. Nor I weren't, neither, I\nsays.”\n\nAnd with that he winked and pinched me hard.\n\n“Just you mention them words to your squire, Jim,” he went on. “Nor he\nweren't, neither--that's the words. Three years he were the man of this\nisland, light and dark, fair and rain; and sometimes he would maybe\nthink upon a prayer (says you), and sometimes he would maybe think of\nhis old mother, so be as she's alive (you'll say); but the most part\nof Gunn's time (this is what you'll say)--the most part of his time was\ntook up with another matter. And then you'll give him a nip, like I do.”\n\nAnd he pinched me again in the most confidential manner.\n\n“Then,” he continued, “then you'll up, and you'll say this: Gunn is a\ngood man (you'll say), and he puts a precious sight more confidence--a\nprecious sight, mind that--in a gen'leman born than in these gen'leman\nof fortune, having been one hisself.”\n\n“Well,” I said, “I don't understand one word that you've been saying.\nBut that's neither here nor there; for how am I to get on board?”\n\n“Ah,” said he, “that's the hitch, for sure. Well, there's my boat, that\nI made with my two hands. I keep her under the white rock. If the worst\ncome to the worst, we might try that after dark. Hi!” he broke out.\n“What's that?”\n\nFor just then, although the sun had still an hour or two to run, all the\nechoes of the island awoke and bellowed to the thunder of a cannon.\n\n“They have begun to fight!” I cried. “Follow me.”\n\nAnd I began to run towards the anchorage, my terrors all forgotten,\nwhile close at my side the marooned man in his goatskins trotted easily\nand lightly.\n\n“Left, left,” says he; “keep to your left hand, mate Jim! Under the\ntrees with you! Theer's where I killed my first goat. They don't come\ndown here now; they're all mastheaded on them mountings for the fear\nof Benjamin Gunn. Ah! And there's the cetemery”--cemetery, he must have\nmeant. “You see the mounds? I come here and prayed, nows and thens, when\nI thought maybe a Sunday would be about doo. It weren't quite a chapel,\nbut it seemed more solemn like; and then, says you, Ben Gunn was\nshort-handed--no chapling, nor so much as a Bible and a flag, you says.”\n\nSo he kept talking as I ran, neither expecting nor receiving any answer.\n\nThe cannon-shot was followed after a considerable interval by a volley\nof small arms.\n\nAnother pause, and then, not a quarter of a mile in front of me, I\nbeheld the Union Jack flutter in the air above a wood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPART FOUR--The Stockade\n\n\n\n\n16\n\nNarrative Continued by the Doctor: How the Ship Was Abandoned\n\nIT was about half past one--three bells in the sea phrase--that the two\nboats went ashore from the HISPANIOLA. The captain, the squire, and I\nwere talking matters over in the cabin. Had there been a breath of wind,\nwe should have fallen on the six mutineers who were left aboard with\nus, slipped our cable, and away to sea. But the wind was wanting; and\nto complete our helplessness, down came Hunter with the news that Jim\nHawkins had slipped into a boat and was gone ashore with the rest.\n\nIt never occurred to us to doubt Jim Hawkins, but we were alarmed for\nhis safety. With the men in the temper they were in, it seemed an even\nchance if we should see the lad again. We ran on deck. The pitch was\nbubbling in the seams; the nasty stench of the place turned me sick;\nif ever a man smelt fever and dysentery, it was in that abominable\nanchorage. The six scoundrels were sitting grumbling under a sail in the\nforecastle; ashore we could see the gigs made fast and a man sitting\nin each, hard by where the river runs in. One of them was whistling\n“Lillibullero.”\n\nWaiting was a strain, and it was decided that Hunter and I should go\nashore with the jolly-boat in quest of information.\n\nThe gigs had leaned to their right, but Hunter and I pulled straight in,\nin the direction of the stockade upon the chart. The two who were\nleft guarding their boats seemed in a bustle at our appearance;\n“Lillibullero” stopped off, and I could see the pair discussing what\nthey ought to do. Had they gone and told Silver, all might have turned\nout differently; but they had their orders, I suppose, and decided to\nsit quietly where they were and hark back again to “Lillibullero.”\n\nThere was a slight bend in the coast, and I steered so as to put it\nbetween us; even before we landed we had thus lost sight of the gigs.\nI jumped out and came as near running as I durst, with a big silk\nhandkerchief under my hat for coolness' sake and a brace of pistols\nready primed for safety.\n\nI had not gone a hundred yards when I reached the stockade.\n\nThis was how it was: a spring of clear water rose almost at the top of a\nknoll. Well, on the knoll, and enclosing the spring, they had clapped a\nstout loghouse fit to hold two score of people on a pinch and loopholed\nfor musketry on either side. All round this they had cleared a wide\nspace, and then the thing was completed by a paling six feet high,\nwithout door or opening, too strong to pull down without time and labour\nand too open to shelter the besiegers. The people in the log-house had\nthem in every way; they stood quiet in shelter and shot the others like\npartridges. All they wanted was a good watch and food; for, short of a\ncomplete surprise, they might have held the place against a regiment.\n\nWhat particularly took my fancy was the spring. For though we had a good\nenough place of it in the cabin of the HISPANIOLA, with plenty of arms\nand ammunition, and things to eat, and excellent wines, there had been\none thing overlooked--we had no water. I was thinking this over when\nthere came ringing over the island the cry of a man at the point of\ndeath. I was not new to violent death--I have served his Royal Highness\nthe Duke of Cumberland, and got a wound myself at Fontenoy--but I know\nmy pulse went dot and carry one. “Jim Hawkins is gone,” was my first\nthought.\n\nIt is something to have been an old soldier, but more still to have been\na doctor. There is no time to dilly-dally in our work. And so now I made\nup my mind instantly, and with no time lost returned to the shore and\njumped on board the jolly-boat.\n\nBy good fortune Hunter pulled a good oar. We made the water fly, and the\nboat was soon alongside and I aboard the schooner.\n\nI found them all shaken, as was natural. The squire was sitting down, as\nwhite as a sheet, thinking of the harm he had led us to, the good soul!\nAnd one of the six forecastle hands was little better.\n\n“There's a man,” says Captain Smollett, nodding towards him, “new to\nthis work. He came nigh-hand fainting, doctor, when he heard the cry.\nAnother touch of the rudder and that man would join us.”\n\nI told my plan to the captain, and between us we settled on the details\nof its accomplishment.\n\nWe put old Redruth in the gallery between the cabin and the forecastle,\nwith three or four loaded muskets and a mattress for protection. Hunter\nbrought the boat round under the stern-port, and Joyce and I set to work\nloading her with powder tins, muskets, bags of biscuits, kegs of pork, a\ncask of cognac, and my invaluable medicine chest.\n\nIn the meantime, the squire and the captain stayed on deck, and the\nlatter hailed the coxswain, who was the principal man aboard.\n\n“Mr. Hands,” he said, “here are two of us with a brace of pistols each.\nIf any one of you six make a signal of any description, that man's\ndead.”\n\nThey were a good deal taken aback, and after a little consultation one\nand all tumbled down the fore companion, thinking no doubt to take us\non the rear. But when they saw Redruth waiting for them in the sparred\ngalley, they went about ship at once, and a head popped out again on\ndeck.\n\n“Down, dog!” cries the captain.\n\nAnd the head popped back again; and we heard no more, for the time, of\nthese six very faint-hearted seamen.\n\nBy this time, tumbling things in as they came, we had the jolly-boat\nloaded as much as we dared. Joyce and I got out through the stern-port,\nand we made for shore again as fast as oars could take us.\n\nThis second trip fairly aroused the watchers along shore. “Lillibullero”\n was dropped again; and just before we lost sight of them behind the\nlittle point, one of them whipped ashore and disappeared. I had half a\nmind to change my plan and destroy their boats, but I feared that Silver\nand the others might be close at hand, and all might very well be lost\nby trying for too much.\n\nWe had soon touched land in the same place as before and set to\nprovision the block house. All three made the first journey, heavily\nladen, and tossed our stores over the palisade. Then, leaving Joyce to\nguard them--one man, to be sure, but with half a dozen muskets--Hunter\nand I returned to the jolly-boat and loaded ourselves once more. So\nwe proceeded without pausing to take breath, till the whole cargo was\nbestowed, when the two servants took up their position in the block\nhouse, and I, with all my power, sculled back to the HISPANIOLA.\n\nThat we should have risked a second boat load seems more daring than it\nreally was. They had the advantage of numbers, of course, but we had the\nadvantage of arms. Not one of the men ashore had a musket, and before\nthey could get within range for pistol shooting, we flattered ourselves\nwe should be able to give a good account of a half-dozen at least.\n\nThe squire was waiting for me at the stern window, all his faintness\ngone from him. He caught the painter and made it fast, and we fell to\nloading the boat for our very lives. Pork, powder, and biscuit was the\ncargo, with only a musket and a cutlass apiece for the squire and me\nand Redruth and the captain. The rest of the arms and powder we dropped\noverboard in two fathoms and a half of water, so that we could see\nthe bright steel shining far below us in the sun, on the clean, sandy\nbottom.\n\nBy this time the tide was beginning to ebb, and the ship was swinging\nround to her anchor. Voices were heard faintly halloaing in the\ndirection of the two gigs; and though this reassured us for Joyce and\nHunter, who were well to the eastward, it warned our party to be off.\n\nRedruth retreated from his place in the gallery and dropped into the\nboat, which we then brought round to the ship's counter, to be handier\nfor Captain Smollett.\n\n“Now, men,” said he, “do you hear me?”\n\nThere was no answer from the forecastle.\n\n“It's to you, Abraham Gray--it's to you I am speaking.”\n\nStill no reply.\n\n“Gray,” resumed Mr. Smollett, a little louder, “I am leaving this ship,\nand I order you to follow your captain. I know you are a good man at\nbottom, and I dare say not one of the lot of you's as bad as he makes\nout. I have my watch here in my hand; I give you thirty seconds to join\nme in.”\n\nThere was a pause.\n\n“Come, my fine fellow,” continued the captain; “don't hang so long in\nstays. I'm risking my life and the lives of these good gentlemen every\nsecond.”\n\nThere was a sudden scuffle, a sound of blows, and out burst Abraham\nGray with a knife cut on the side of the cheek, and came running to the\ncaptain like a dog to the whistle.\n\n“I'm with you, sir,” said he.\n\nAnd the next moment he and the captain had dropped aboard of us, and we\nhad shoved off and given way.\n\nWe were clear out of the ship, but not yet ashore in our stockade.\n\n\n\n\n17\n\nNarrative Continued by the Doctor: The Jolly-boat's Last Trip\n\nTHIS fifth trip was quite different from any of the others. In the\nfirst place, the little gallipot of a boat that we were in was gravely\noverloaded. Five grown men, and three of them--Trelawney, Redruth, and\nthe captain--over six feet high, was already more than she was meant\nto carry. Add to that the powder, pork, and bread-bags. The gunwale was\nlipping astern. Several times we shipped a little water, and my breeches\nand the tails of my coat were all soaking wet before we had gone a\nhundred yards.\n\nThe captain made us trim the boat, and we got her to lie a little more\nevenly. All the same, we were afraid to breathe.\n\nIn the second place, the ebb was now making--a strong rippling current\nrunning westward through the basin, and then south'ard and seaward down\nthe straits by which we had entered in the morning. Even the ripples\nwere a danger to our overloaded craft, but the worst of it was that we\nwere swept out of our true course and away from our proper landing-place\nbehind the point. If we let the current have its way we should come\nashore beside the gigs, where the pirates might appear at any moment.\n\n“I cannot keep her head for the stockade, sir,” said I to the captain.\nI was steering, while he and Redruth, two fresh men, were at the oars.\n“The tide keeps washing her down. Could you pull a little stronger?”\n\n“Not without swamping the boat,” said he. “You must bear up, sir, if you\nplease--bear up until you see you're gaining.”\n\nI tried and found by experiment that the tide kept sweeping us westward\nuntil I had laid her head due east, or just about right angles to the\nway we ought to go.\n\n“We'll never get ashore at this rate,” said I.\n\n“If it's the only course that we can lie, sir, we must even lie it,”\n returned the captain. “We must keep upstream. You see, sir,” he went on,\n“if once we dropped to leeward of the landing-place, it's hard to say\nwhere we should get ashore, besides the chance of being boarded by the\ngigs; whereas, the way we go the current must slacken, and then we can\ndodge back along the shore.”\n\n“The current's less a'ready, sir,” said the man Gray, who was sitting in\nthe fore-sheets; “you can ease her off a bit.”\n\n“Thank you, my man,” said I, quite as if nothing had happened, for we\nhad all quietly made up our minds to treat him like one of ourselves.\n\nSuddenly the captain spoke up again, and I thought his voice was a\nlittle changed.\n\n“The gun!” said he.\n\n“I have thought of that,” said I, for I made sure he was thinking of a\nbombardment of the fort. “They could never get the gun ashore, and if\nthey did, they could never haul it through the woods.”\n\n“Look astern, doctor,” replied the captain.\n\nWe had entirely forgotten the long nine; and there, to our horror, were\nthe five rogues busy about her, getting off her jacket, as they called\nthe stout tarpaulin cover under which she sailed. Not only that, but\nit flashed into my mind at the same moment that the round-shot and the\npowder for the gun had been left behind, and a stroke with an axe would\nput it all into the possession of the evil ones abroad.\n\n“Israel was Flint's gunner,” said Gray hoarsely.\n\nAt any risk, we put the boat's head direct for the landing-place. By\nthis time we had got so far out of the run of the current that we kept\nsteerage way even at our necessarily gentle rate of rowing, and I could\nkeep her steady for the goal. But the worst of it was that with the\ncourse I now held we turned our broadside instead of our stern to the\nHISPANIOLA and offered a target like a barn door.\n\nI could hear as well as see that brandy-faced rascal Israel Hands\nplumping down a round-shot on the deck.\n\n“Who's the best shot?” asked the captain.\n\n“Mr. Trelawney, out and away,” said I.\n\n“Mr. Trelawney, will you please pick me off one of these men, sir?\nHands, if possible,” said the captain.\n\nTrelawney was as cool as steel. He looked to the priming of his gun.\n\n“Now,” cried the captain, “easy with that gun, sir, or you'll swamp the\nboat. All hands stand by to trim her when he aims.”\n\nThe squire raised his gun, the rowing ceased, and we leaned over to the\nother side to keep the balance, and all was so nicely contrived that we\ndid not ship a drop.\n\nThey had the gun, by this time, slewed round upon the swivel, and Hands,\nwho was at the muzzle with the rammer, was in consequence the most\nexposed. However, we had no luck, for just as Trelawney fired, down he\nstooped, the ball whistled over him, and it was one of the other four\nwho fell.\n\nThe cry he gave was echoed not only by his companions on board but by a\ngreat number of voices from the shore, and looking in that direction\nI saw the other pirates trooping out from among the trees and tumbling\ninto their places in the boats.\n\n“Here come the gigs, sir,” said I.\n\n“Give way, then,” cried the captain. “We mustn't mind if we swamp her\nnow. If we can't get ashore, all's up.”\n\n“Only one of the gigs is being manned, sir,” I added; “the crew of the\nother most likely going round by shore to cut us off.”\n\n“They'll have a hot run, sir,” returned the captain. “Jack ashore, you\nknow. It's not them I mind; it's the round-shot. Carpet bowls! My lady's\nmaid couldn't miss. Tell us, squire, when you see the match, and we'll\nhold water.”\n\nIn the meanwhile we had been making headway at a good pace for a boat so\noverloaded, and we had shipped but little water in the process. We were\nnow close in; thirty or forty strokes and we should beach her, for the\nebb had already disclosed a narrow belt of sand below the clustering\ntrees. The gig was no longer to be feared; the little point had already\nconcealed it from our eyes. The ebb-tide, which had so cruelly delayed\nus, was now making reparation and delaying our assailants. The one\nsource of danger was the gun.\n\n“If I durst,” said the captain, “I'd stop and pick off another man.”\n\nBut it was plain that they meant nothing should delay their shot. They\nhad never so much as looked at their fallen comrade, though he was not\ndead, and I could see him trying to crawl away.\n\n“Ready!” cried the squire.\n\n“Hold!” cried the captain, quick as an echo.\n\nAnd he and Redruth backed with a great heave that sent her stern bodily\nunder water. The report fell in at the same instant of time. This was\nthe first that Jim heard, the sound of the squire's shot not having\nreached him. Where the ball passed, not one of us precisely knew, but I\nfancy it must have been over our heads and that the wind of it may have\ncontributed to our disaster.\n\nAt any rate, the boat sank by the stern, quite gently, in three feet of\nwater, leaving the captain and myself, facing each other, on our feet.\nThe other three took complete headers, and came up again drenched and\nbubbling.\n\nSo far there was no great harm. No lives were lost, and we could wade\nashore in safety. But there were all our stores at the bottom, and to\nmake things worse, only two guns out of five remained in a state for\nservice. Mine I had snatched from my knees and held over my head, by\na sort of instinct. As for the captain, he had carried his over his\nshoulder by a bandoleer, and like a wise man, lock uppermost. The other\nthree had gone down with the boat.\n\nTo add to our concern, we heard voices already drawing near us in the\nwoods along shore, and we had not only the danger of being cut off from\nthe stockade in our half-crippled state but the fear before us whether,\nif Hunter and Joyce were attacked by half a dozen, they would have the\nsense and conduct to stand firm. Hunter was steady, that we knew; Joyce\nwas a doubtful case--a pleasant, polite man for a valet and to brush\none's clothes, but not entirely fitted for a man of war.\n\nWith all this in our minds, we waded ashore as fast as we could, leaving\nbehind us the poor jolly-boat and a good half of all our powder and\nprovisions.\n\n\n\n\n18\n\nNarrative Continued by the Doctor: End of the First Day's Fighting\n\nWE made our best speed across the strip of wood that now divided us from\nthe stockade, and at every step we took the voices of the buccaneers\nrang nearer. Soon we could hear their footfalls as they ran and the\ncracking of the branches as they breasted across a bit of thicket.\n\nI began to see we should have a brush for it in earnest and looked to my\npriming.\n\n“Captain,” said I, “Trelawney is the dead shot. Give him your gun; his\nown is useless.”\n\nThey exchanged guns, and Trelawney, silent and cool as he had been since\nthe beginning of the bustle, hung a moment on his heel to see that all\nwas fit for service. At the same time, observing Gray to be unarmed, I\nhanded him my cutlass. It did all our hearts good to see him spit in his\nhand, knit his brows, and make the blade sing through the air. It was\nplain from every line of his body that our new hand was worth his salt.\n\nForty paces farther we came to the edge of the wood and saw the stockade\nin front of us. We struck the enclosure about the middle of the south\nside, and almost at the same time, seven mutineers--Job Anderson, the\nboatswain, at their head--appeared in full cry at the southwestern\ncorner.\n\nThey paused as if taken aback, and before they recovered, not only the\nsquire and I, but Hunter and Joyce from the block house, had time to\nfire. The four shots came in rather a scattering volley, but they did\nthe business: one of the enemy actually fell, and the rest, without\nhesitation, turned and plunged into the trees.\n\nAfter reloading, we walked down the outside of the palisade to see to\nthe fallen enemy. He was stone dead--shot through the heart.\n\nWe began to rejoice over our good success when just at that moment a\npistol cracked in the bush, a ball whistled close past my ear, and poor\nTom Redruth stumbled and fell his length on the ground. Both the squire\nand I returned the shot, but as we had nothing to aim at, it is probable\nwe only wasted powder. Then we reloaded and turned our attention to poor\nTom.\n\nThe captain and Gray were already examining him, and I saw with half an\neye that all was over.\n\nI believe the readiness of our return volley had scattered the mutineers\nonce more, for we were suffered without further molestation to get the\npoor old gamekeeper hoisted over the stockade and carried, groaning and\nbleeding, into the log-house.\n\nPoor old fellow, he had not uttered one word of surprise, complaint,\nfear, or even acquiescence from the very beginning of our troubles till\nnow, when we had laid him down in the log-house to die. He had lain like\na Trojan behind his mattress in the gallery; he had followed every order\nsilently, doggedly, and well; he was the oldest of our party by a score\nof years; and now, sullen, old, serviceable servant, it was he that was\nto die.\n\nThe squire dropped down beside him on his knees and kissed his hand,\ncrying like a child.\n\n“Be I going, doctor?” he asked.\n\n“Tom, my man,” said I, “you're going home.”\n\n“I wish I had had a lick at them with the gun first,” he replied.\n\n“Tom,” said the squire, “say you forgive me, won't you?”\n\n“Would that be respectful like, from me to you, squire?” was the answer.\n“Howsoever, so be it, amen!”\n\nAfter a little while of silence, he said he thought somebody might read\na prayer. “It's the custom, sir,” he added apologetically. And not long\nafter, without another word, he passed away.\n\nIn the meantime the captain, whom I had observed to be wonderfully\nswollen about the chest and pockets, had turned out a great many various\nstores--the British colours, a Bible, a coil of stoutish rope, pen, ink,\nthe log-book, and pounds of tobacco. He had found a longish fir-tree\nlying felled and trimmed in the enclosure, and with the help of Hunter\nhe had set it up at the corner of the log-house where the trunks crossed\nand made an angle. Then, climbing on the roof, he had with his own hand\nbent and run up the colours.\n\nThis seemed mightily to relieve him. He re-entered the log-house and set\nabout counting up the stores as if nothing else existed. But he had an\neye on Tom's passage for all that, and as soon as all was over, came\nforward with another flag and reverently spread it on the body.\n\n“Don't you take on, sir,” he said, shaking the squire's hand. “All's\nwell with him; no fear for a hand that's been shot down in his duty to\ncaptain and owner. It mayn't be good divinity, but it's a fact.”\n\nThen he pulled me aside.\n\n“Dr. Livesey,” he said, “in how many weeks do you and squire expect the\nconsort?”\n\nI told him it was a question not of weeks but of months, that if we\nwere not back by the end of August Blandly was to send to find us, but\nneither sooner nor later. “You can calculate for yourself,” I said.\n\n“Why, yes,” returned the captain, scratching his head; “and making a\nlarge allowance, sir, for all the gifts of Providence, I should say we\nwere pretty close hauled.”\n\n“How do you mean?” I asked.\n\n“It's a pity, sir, we lost that second load. That's what I mean,”\n replied the captain. “As for powder and shot, we'll do. But the rations\nare short, very short--so short, Dr. Livesey, that we're perhaps as well\nwithout that extra mouth.”\n\nAnd he pointed to the dead body under the flag.\n\nJust then, with a roar and a whistle, a round-shot passed high above the\nroof of the log-house and plumped far beyond us in the wood.\n\n“Oho!” said the captain. “Blaze away! You've little enough powder\nalready, my lads.”\n\nAt the second trial, the aim was better, and the ball descended inside\nthe stockade, scattering a cloud of sand but doing no further damage.\n\n“Captain,” said the squire, “the house is quite invisible from the ship.\nIt must be the flag they are aiming at. Would it not be wiser to take it\nin?”\n\n“Strike my colours!” cried the captain. “No, sir, not I”; and as soon\nas he had said the words, I think we all agreed with him. For it was\nnot only a piece of stout, seamanly, good feeling; it was good policy\nbesides and showed our enemies that we despised their cannonade.\n\nAll through the evening they kept thundering away. Ball after ball flew\nover or fell short or kicked up the sand in the enclosure, but they had\nto fire so high that the shot fell dead and buried itself in the soft\nsand. We had no ricochet to fear, and though one popped in through the\nroof of the log-house and out again through the floor, we soon got used\nto that sort of horse-play and minded it no more than cricket.\n\n“There is one good thing about all this,” observed the captain; “the\nwood in front of us is likely clear. The ebb has made a good while; our\nstores should be uncovered. Volunteers to go and bring in pork.”\n\nGray and Hunter were the first to come forward. Well armed, they stole\nout of the stockade, but it proved a useless mission. The mutineers were\nbolder than we fancied or they put more trust in Israel's gunnery. For\nfour or five of them were busy carrying off our stores and wading out\nwith them to one of the gigs that lay close by, pulling an oar or so to\nhold her steady against the current. Silver was in the stern-sheets in\ncommand; and every man of them was now provided with a musket from some\nsecret magazine of their own.\n\nThe captain sat down to his log, and here is the beginning of the entry:\n\n     Alexander Smollett, master; David Livesey, ship's\n     doctor; Abraham Gray, carpenter's mate; John\n     Trelawney, owner; John Hunter and Richard Joyce,\n     owner's servants, landsmen--being all that is left\n     faithful of the ship's company--with stores for ten\n     days at short rations, came ashore this day and flew\n     British colours on the log-house in Treasure Island.\n     Thomas Redruth, owner's servant, landsman, shot by the\n     mutineers; James Hawkins, cabin-boy--\n\nAnd at the same time, I was wondering over poor Jim Hawkins' fate.\n\nA hail on the land side.\n\n“Somebody hailing us,” said Hunter, who was on guard.\n\n“Doctor! Squire! Captain! Hullo, Hunter, is that you?” came the cries.\n\nAnd I ran to the door in time to see Jim Hawkins, safe and sound, come\nclimbing over the stockade.\n\n\n\n\n19\n\nNarrative Resumed by Jim Hawkins: The Garrison in the Stockade\n\nAS soon as Ben Gunn saw the colours he came to a halt, stopped me by the\narm, and sat down.\n\n“Now,” said he, “there's your friends, sure enough.”\n\n“Far more likely it's the mutineers,” I answered.\n\n“That!” he cried. “Why, in a place like this, where nobody puts in but\ngen'lemen of fortune, Silver would fly the Jolly Roger, you don't make\nno doubt of that. No, that's your friends. There's been blows too, and I\nreckon your friends has had the best of it; and here they are ashore in\nthe old stockade, as was made years and years ago by Flint. Ah, he was\nthe man to have a headpiece, was Flint! Barring rum, his match were\nnever seen. He were afraid of none, not he; on'y Silver--Silver was that\ngenteel.”\n\n“Well,” said I, “that may be so, and so be it; all the more reason that\nI should hurry on and join my friends.”\n\n“Nay, mate,” returned Ben, “not you. You're a good boy, or I'm mistook;\nbut you're on'y a boy, all told. Now, Ben Gunn is fly. Rum wouldn't\nbring me there, where you're going--not rum wouldn't, till I see your\nborn gen'leman and gets it on his word of honour. And you won't forget\nmy words; 'A precious sight (that's what you'll say), a precious sight\nmore confidence'--and then nips him.”\n\nAnd he pinched me the third time with the same air of cleverness.\n\n“And when Ben Gunn is wanted, you know where to find him, Jim. Just\nwheer you found him today. And him that comes is to have a white thing\nin his hand, and he's to come alone. Oh! And you'll say this: 'Ben\nGunn,' says you, 'has reasons of his own.'”\n\n“Well,” said I, “I believe I understand. You have something to propose,\nand you wish to see the squire or the doctor, and you're to be found\nwhere I found you. Is that all?”\n\n“And when? says you,” he added. “Why, from about noon observation to\nabout six bells.”\n\n“Good,” said I, “and now may I go?”\n\n“You won't forget?” he inquired anxiously. “Precious sight, and reasons\nof his own, says you. Reasons of his own; that's the mainstay; as\nbetween man and man. Well, then”--still holding me--“I reckon you can\ngo, Jim. And, Jim, if you was to see Silver, you wouldn't go for to sell\nBen Gunn? Wild horses wouldn't draw it from you? No, says you. And if\nthem pirates camp ashore, Jim, what would you say but there'd be widders\nin the morning?”\n\nHere he was interrupted by a loud report, and a cannonball came tearing\nthrough the trees and pitched in the sand not a hundred yards from where\nwe two were talking. The next moment each of us had taken to his heels\nin a different direction.\n\nFor a good hour to come frequent reports shook the island, and\nballs kept crashing through the woods. I moved from hiding-place to\nhiding-place, always pursued, or so it seemed to me, by these terrifying\nmissiles. But towards the end of the bombardment, though still I durst\nnot venture in the direction of the stockade, where the balls fell\noftenest, I had begun, in a manner, to pluck up my heart again, and\nafter a long detour to the east, crept down among the shore-side trees.\n\nThe sun had just set, the sea breeze was rustling and tumbling in the\nwoods and ruffling the grey surface of the anchorage; the tide, too, was\nfar out, and great tracts of sand lay uncovered; the air, after the heat\nof the day, chilled me through my jacket.\n\nThe HISPANIOLA still lay where she had anchored; but, sure enough, there\nwas the Jolly Roger--the black flag of piracy--flying from her peak.\nEven as I looked, there came another red flash and another report that\nsent the echoes clattering, and one more round-shot whistled through the\nair. It was the last of the cannonade.\n\nI lay for some time watching the bustle which succeeded the attack. Men\nwere demolishing something with axes on the beach near the stockade--the\npoor jolly-boat, I afterwards discovered. Away, near the mouth of the\nriver, a great fire was glowing among the trees, and between that point\nand the ship one of the gigs kept coming and going, the men, whom I\nhad seen so gloomy, shouting at the oars like children. But there was a\nsound in their voices which suggested rum.\n\nAt length I thought I might return towards the stockade. I was pretty\nfar down on the low, sandy spit that encloses the anchorage to the east,\nand is joined at half-water to Skeleton Island; and now, as I rose to my\nfeet, I saw, some distance further down the spit and rising from among\nlow bushes, an isolated rock, pretty high, and peculiarly white in\ncolour. It occurred to me that this might be the white rock of which Ben\nGunn had spoken and that some day or other a boat might be wanted and I\nshould know where to look for one.\n\nThen I skirted among the woods until I had regained the rear, or\nshoreward side, of the stockade, and was soon warmly welcomed by the\nfaithful party.\n\nI had soon told my story and began to look about me. The log-house was\nmade of unsquared trunks of pine--roof, walls, and floor. The latter\nstood in several places as much as a foot or a foot and a half above the\nsurface of the sand. There was a porch at the door, and under this porch\nthe little spring welled up into an artificial basin of a rather odd\nkind--no other than a great ship's kettle of iron, with the bottom\nknocked out, and sunk “to her bearings,” as the captain said, among the\nsand.\n\nLittle had been left besides the framework of the house, but in one\ncorner there was a stone slab laid down by way of hearth and an old\nrusty iron basket to contain the fire.\n\nThe slopes of the knoll and all the inside of the stockade had been\ncleared of timber to build the house, and we could see by the stumps\nwhat a fine and lofty grove had been destroyed. Most of the soil had\nbeen washed away or buried in drift after the removal of the trees; only\nwhere the streamlet ran down from the kettle a thick bed of moss and\nsome ferns and little creeping bushes were still green among the sand.\nVery close around the stockade--too close for defence, they said--the\nwood still flourished high and dense, all of fir on the land side, but\ntowards the sea with a large admixture of live-oaks.\n\nThe cold evening breeze, of which I have spoken, whistled through every\nchink of the rude building and sprinkled the floor with a continual rain\nof fine sand. There was sand in our eyes, sand in our teeth, sand in our\nsuppers, sand dancing in the spring at the bottom of the kettle, for all\nthe world like porridge beginning to boil. Our chimney was a square hole\nin the roof; it was but a little part of the smoke that found its way\nout, and the rest eddied about the house and kept us coughing and piping\nthe eye.\n\nAdd to this that Gray, the new man, had his face tied up in a bandage\nfor a cut he had got in breaking away from the mutineers and that poor\nold Tom Redruth, still unburied, lay along the wall, stiff and stark,\nunder the Union Jack.\n\nIf we had been allowed to sit idle, we should all have fallen in the\nblues, but Captain Smollett was never the man for that. All hands were\ncalled up before him, and he divided us into watches. The doctor and\nGray and I for one; the squire, Hunter, and Joyce upon the other. Tired\nthough we all were, two were sent out for firewood; two more were set to\ndig a grave for Redruth; the doctor was named cook; I was put sentry at\nthe door; and the captain himself went from one to another, keeping up\nour spirits and lending a hand wherever it was wanted.\n\nFrom time to time the doctor came to the door for a little air and to\nrest his eyes, which were almost smoked out of his head, and whenever he\ndid so, he had a word for me.\n\n“That man Smollett,” he said once, “is a better man than I am. And when\nI say that it means a deal, Jim.”\n\nAnother time he came and was silent for a while. Then he put his head on\none side, and looked at me.\n\n“Is this Ben Gunn a man?” he asked.\n\n“I do not know, sir,” said I. “I am not very sure whether he's sane.”\n\n“If there's any doubt about the matter, he is,” returned the doctor. “A\nman who has been three years biting his nails on a desert island, Jim,\ncan't expect to appear as sane as you or me. It doesn't lie in human\nnature. Was it cheese you said he had a fancy for?”\n\n“Yes, sir, cheese,” I answered.\n\n“Well, Jim,” says he, “just see the good that comes of being dainty in\nyour food. You've seen my snuff-box, haven't you? And you never saw me\ntake snuff, the reason being that in my snuff-box I carry a piece of\nParmesan cheese--a cheese made in Italy, very nutritious. Well, that's\nfor Ben Gunn!”\n\nBefore supper was eaten we buried old Tom in the sand and stood round\nhim for a while bare-headed in the breeze. A good deal of firewood had\nbeen got in, but not enough for the captain's fancy, and he shook his\nhead over it and told us we “must get back to this tomorrow rather\nlivelier.” Then, when we had eaten our pork and each had a good stiff\nglass of brandy grog, the three chiefs got together in a corner to\ndiscuss our prospects.\n\nIt appears they were at their wits' end what to do, the stores being so\nlow that we must have been starved into surrender long before help came.\nBut our best hope, it was decided, was to kill off the buccaneers until\nthey either hauled down their flag or ran away with the HISPANIOLA. From\nnineteen they were already reduced to fifteen, two others were wounded,\nand one at least--the man shot beside the gun--severely wounded, if he\nwere not dead. Every time we had a crack at them, we were to take it,\nsaving our own lives, with the extremest care. And besides that, we had\ntwo able allies--rum and the climate.\n\nAs for the first, though we were about half a mile away, we could hear\nthem roaring and singing late into the night; and as for the second,\nthe doctor staked his wig that, camped where they were in the marsh\nand unprovided with remedies, the half of them would be on their backs\nbefore a week.\n\n“So,” he added, “if we are not all shot down first they'll be glad to\nbe packing in the schooner. It's always a ship, and they can get to\nbuccaneering again, I suppose.”\n\n“First ship that ever I lost,” said Captain Smollett.\n\nI was dead tired, as you may fancy; and when I got to sleep, which was\nnot till after a great deal of tossing, I slept like a log of wood.\n\nThe rest had long been up and had already breakfasted and increased the\npile of firewood by about half as much again when I was wakened by a\nbustle and the sound of voices.\n\n“Flag of truce!” I heard someone say; and then, immediately after, with\na cry of surprise, “Silver himself!”\n\nAnd at that, up I jumped, and rubbing my eyes, ran to a loophole in the\nwall.\n\n\n\n\n20\n\nSilver's Embassy\n\nSURE enough, there were two men just outside the stockade, one of them\nwaving a white cloth, the other, no less a person than Silver himself,\nstanding placidly by.\n\nIt was still quite early, and the coldest morning that I think I ever\nwas abroad in--a chill that pierced into the marrow. The sky was bright\nand cloudless overhead, and the tops of the trees shone rosily in\nthe sun. But where Silver stood with his lieutenant, all was still in\nshadow, and they waded knee-deep in a low white vapour that had crawled\nduring the night out of the morass. The chill and the vapour taken\ntogether told a poor tale of the island. It was plainly a damp,\nfeverish, unhealthy spot.\n\n“Keep indoors, men,” said the captain. “Ten to one this is a trick.”\n\nThen he hailed the buccaneer.\n\n“Who goes? Stand, or we fire.”\n\n“Flag of truce,” cried Silver.\n\nThe captain was in the porch, keeping himself carefully out of the way\nof a treacherous shot, should any be intended. He turned and spoke to\nus, “Doctor's watch on the lookout. Dr. Livesey take the north side,\nif you please; Jim, the east; Gray, west. The watch below, all hands to\nload muskets. Lively, men, and careful.”\n\nAnd then he turned again to the mutineers.\n\n“And what do you want with your flag of truce?” he cried.\n\nThis time it was the other man who replied.\n\n“Cap'n Silver, sir, to come on board and make terms,” he shouted.\n\n“Cap'n Silver! Don't know him. Who's he?” cried the captain. And we\ncould hear him adding to himself, “Cap'n, is it? My heart, and here's\npromotion!”\n\nLong John answered for himself. “Me, sir. These poor lads have chosen me\ncap'n, after your desertion, sir”--laying a particular emphasis upon the\nword “desertion.” “We're willing to submit, if we can come to terms,\nand no bones about it. All I ask is your word, Cap'n Smollett, to let me\nsafe and sound out of this here stockade, and one minute to get out o'\nshot before a gun is fired.”\n\n“My man,” said Captain Smollett, “I have not the slightest desire to\ntalk to you. If you wish to talk to me, you can come, that's all. If\nthere's any treachery, it'll be on your side, and the Lord help you.”\n\n“That's enough, cap'n,” shouted Long John cheerily. “A word from you's\nenough. I know a gentleman, and you may lay to that.”\n\nWe could see the man who carried the flag of truce attempting to hold\nSilver back. Nor was that wonderful, seeing how cavalier had been the\ncaptain's answer. But Silver laughed at him aloud and slapped him on the\nback as if the idea of alarm had been absurd. Then he advanced to the\nstockade, threw over his crutch, got a leg up, and with great vigour\nand skill succeeded in surmounting the fence and dropping safely to the\nother side.\n\nI will confess that I was far too much taken up with what was going on\nto be of the slightest use as sentry; indeed, I had already deserted\nmy eastern loophole and crept up behind the captain, who had now seated\nhimself on the threshold, with his elbows on his knees, his head in his\nhands, and his eyes fixed on the water as it bubbled out of the old iron\nkettle in the sand. He was whistling “Come, Lasses and Lads.”\n\nSilver had terrible hard work getting up the knoll. What with the\nsteepness of the incline, the thick tree stumps, and the soft sand, he\nand his crutch were as helpless as a ship in stays. But he stuck to it\nlike a man in silence, and at last arrived before the captain, whom\nhe saluted in the handsomest style. He was tricked out in his best;\nan immense blue coat, thick with brass buttons, hung as low as to his\nknees, and a fine laced hat was set on the back of his head.\n\n“Here you are, my man,” said the captain, raising his head. “You had\nbetter sit down.”\n\n“You ain't a-going to let me inside, cap'n?” complained Long John. “It's\na main cold morning, to be sure, sir, to sit outside upon the sand.”\n\n“Why, Silver,” said the captain, “if you had pleased to be an honest\nman, you might have been sitting in your galley. It's your own doing.\nYou're either my ship's cook--and then you were treated handsome--or\nCap'n Silver, a common mutineer and pirate, and then you can go hang!”\n\n“Well, well, cap'n,” returned the sea-cook, sitting down as he was\nbidden on the sand, “you'll have to give me a hand up again, that's all.\nA sweet pretty place you have of it here. Ah, there's Jim! The top of\nthe morning to you, Jim. Doctor, here's my service. Why, there you all\nare together like a happy family, in a manner of speaking.”\n\n“If you have anything to say, my man, better say it,” said the captain.\n\n“Right you were, Cap'n Smollett,” replied Silver. “Dooty is dooty, to be\nsure. Well now, you look here, that was a good lay of yours last\nnight. I don't deny it was a good lay. Some of you pretty handy with a\nhandspike-end. And I'll not deny neither but what some of my people was\nshook--maybe all was shook; maybe I was shook myself; maybe that's\nwhy I'm here for terms. But you mark me, cap'n, it won't do twice, by\nthunder! We'll have to do sentry-go and ease off a point or so on the\nrum. Maybe you think we were all a sheet in the wind's eye. But I'll\ntell you I was sober; I was on'y dog tired; and if I'd awoke a second\nsooner, I'd 'a caught you at the act, I would. He wasn't dead when I got\nround to him, not he.”\n\n“Well?” says Captain Smollett as cool as can be.\n\nAll that Silver said was a riddle to him, but you would never have\nguessed it from his tone. As for me, I began to have an inkling. Ben\nGunn's last words came back to my mind. I began to suppose that he had\npaid the buccaneers a visit while they all lay drunk together round\ntheir fire, and I reckoned up with glee that we had only fourteen\nenemies to deal with.\n\n“Well, here it is,” said Silver. “We want that treasure, and we'll have\nit--that's our point! You would just as soon save your lives, I reckon;\nand that's yours. You have a chart, haven't you?”\n\n“That's as may be,” replied the captain.\n\n“Oh, well, you have, I know that,” returned Long John. “You needn't be\nso husky with a man; there ain't a particle of service in that, and you\nmay lay to it. What I mean is, we want your chart. Now, I never meant\nyou no harm, myself.”\n\n“That won't do with me, my man,” interrupted the captain. “We know\nexactly what you meant to do, and we don't care, for now, you see, you\ncan't do it.”\n\nAnd the captain looked at him calmly and proceeded to fill a pipe.\n\n“If Abe Gray--” Silver broke out.\n\n“Avast there!” cried Mr. Smollett. “Gray told me nothing, and I asked\nhim nothing; and what's more, I would see you and him and this whole\nisland blown clean out of the water into blazes first. So there's my\nmind for you, my man, on that.”\n\nThis little whiff of temper seemed to cool Silver down. He had been\ngrowing nettled before, but now he pulled himself together.\n\n“Like enough,” said he. “I would set no limits to what gentlemen might\nconsider shipshape, or might not, as the case were. And seein' as how\nyou are about to take a pipe, cap'n, I'll make so free as do likewise.”\n\nAnd he filled a pipe and lighted it; and the two men sat silently\nsmoking for quite a while, now looking each other in the face, now\nstopping their tobacco, now leaning forward to spit. It was as good as\nthe play to see them.\n\n“Now,” resumed Silver, “here it is. You give us the chart to get the\ntreasure by, and drop shooting poor seamen and stoving of their heads in\nwhile asleep. You do that, and we'll offer you a choice. Either you come\naboard along of us, once the treasure shipped, and then I'll give you my\naffy-davy, upon my word of honour, to clap you somewhere safe ashore. Or\nif that ain't to your fancy, some of my hands being rough and having\nold scores on account of hazing, then you can stay here, you can. We'll\ndivide stores with you, man for man; and I'll give my affy-davy, as\nbefore to speak the first ship I sight, and send 'em here to pick you\nup. Now, you'll own that's talking. Handsomer you couldn't look to get,\nnow you. And I hope”--raising his voice--“that all hands in this here\nblock house will overhaul my words, for what is spoke to one is spoke to\nall.”\n\nCaptain Smollett rose from his seat and knocked out the ashes of his\npipe in the palm of his left hand.\n\n“Is that all?” he asked.\n\n“Every last word, by thunder!” answered John. “Refuse that, and you've\nseen the last of me but musket-balls.”\n\n“Very good,” said the captain. “Now you'll hear me. If you'll come up\none by one, unarmed, I'll engage to clap you all in irons and take you\nhome to a fair trial in England. If you won't, my name is Alexander\nSmollett, I've flown my sovereign's colours, and I'll see you all\nto Davy Jones. You can't find the treasure. You can't sail the\nship--there's not a man among you fit to sail the ship. You can't fight\nus--Gray, there, got away from five of you. Your ship's in irons, Master\nSilver; you're on a lee shore, and so you'll find. I stand here and tell\nyou so; and they're the last good words you'll get from me, for in the\nname of heaven, I'll put a bullet in your back when next I meet you.\nTramp, my lad. Bundle out of this, please, hand over hand, and double\nquick.”\n\nSilver's face was a picture; his eyes started in his head with wrath. He\nshook the fire out of his pipe.\n\n“Give me a hand up!” he cried.\n\n“Not I,” returned the captain.\n\n“Who'll give me a hand up?” he roared.\n\nNot a man among us moved. Growling the foulest imprecations, he crawled\nalong the sand till he got hold of the porch and could hoist himself\nagain upon his crutch. Then he spat into the spring.\n\n“There!” he cried. “That's what I think of ye. Before an hour's out,\nI'll stove in your old block house like a rum puncheon. Laugh, by\nthunder, laugh! Before an hour's out, ye'll laugh upon the other side.\nThem that die'll be the lucky ones.”\n\nAnd with a dreadful oath he stumbled off, ploughed down the sand, was\nhelped across the stockade, after four or five failures, by the man with\nthe flag of truce, and disappeared in an instant afterwards among the\ntrees.\n\n\n\n\n21\n\nThe Attack\n\nAS soon as Silver disappeared, the captain, who had been closely\nwatching him, turned towards the interior of the house and found not a\nman of us at his post but Gray. It was the first time we had ever seen\nhim angry.\n\n“Quarters!” he roared. And then, as we all slunk back to our places,\n“Gray,” he said, “I'll put your name in the log; you've stood by your\nduty like a seaman. Mr. Trelawney, I'm surprised at you, sir. Doctor,\nI thought you had worn the king's coat! If that was how you served at\nFontenoy, sir, you'd have been better in your berth.”\n\nThe doctor's watch were all back at their loopholes, the rest were busy\nloading the spare muskets, and everyone with a red face, you may be\ncertain, and a flea in his ear, as the saying is.\n\nThe captain looked on for a while in silence. Then he spoke.\n\n“My lads,” said he, “I've given Silver a broadside. I pitched it in\nred-hot on purpose; and before the hour's out, as he said, we shall be\nboarded. We're outnumbered, I needn't tell you that, but we fight in\nshelter; and a minute ago I should have said we fought with discipline.\nI've no manner of doubt that we can drub them, if you choose.”\n\nThen he went the rounds and saw, as he said, that all was clear.\n\nOn the two short sides of the house, east and west, there were only two\nloopholes; on the south side where the porch was, two again; and on the\nnorth side, five. There was a round score of muskets for the seven\nof us; the firewood had been built into four piles--tables, you might\nsay--one about the middle of each side, and on each of these tables some\nammunition and four loaded muskets were laid ready to the hand of the\ndefenders. In the middle, the cutlasses lay ranged.\n\n“Toss out the fire,” said the captain; “the chill is past, and we\nmustn't have smoke in our eyes.”\n\nThe iron fire-basket was carried bodily out by Mr. Trelawney, and the\nembers smothered among sand.\n\n“Hawkins hasn't had his breakfast. Hawkins, help yourself, and back to\nyour post to eat it,” continued Captain Smollett. “Lively, now, my lad;\nyou'll want it before you've done. Hunter, serve out a round of brandy\nto all hands.”\n\nAnd while this was going on, the captain completed, in his own mind, the\nplan of the defence.\n\n“Doctor, you will take the door,” he resumed. “See, and don't expose\nyourself; keep within, and fire through the porch. Hunter, take the east\nside, there. Joyce, you stand by the west, my man. Mr. Trelawney, you\nare the best shot--you and Gray will take this long north side, with the\nfive loopholes; it's there the danger is. If they can get up to it and\nfire in upon us through our own ports, things would begin to look dirty.\nHawkins, neither you nor I are much account at the shooting; we'll stand\nby to load and bear a hand.”\n\nAs the captain had said, the chill was past. As soon as the sun had\nclimbed above our girdle of trees, it fell with all its force upon the\nclearing and drank up the vapours at a draught. Soon the sand was baking\nand the resin melting in the logs of the block house. Jackets and coats\nwere flung aside, shirts thrown open at the neck and rolled up to the\nshoulders; and we stood there, each at his post, in a fever of heat and\nanxiety.\n\nAn hour passed away.\n\n“Hang them!” said the captain. “This is as dull as the doldrums. Gray,\nwhistle for a wind.”\n\nAnd just at that moment came the first news of the attack.\n\n“If you please, sir,” said Joyce, “if I see anyone, am I to fire?”\n\n“I told you so!” cried the captain.\n\n“Thank you, sir,” returned Joyce with the same quiet civility.\n\nNothing followed for a time, but the remark had set us all on the alert,\nstraining ears and eyes--the musketeers with their pieces balanced in\ntheir hands, the captain out in the middle of the block house with his\nmouth very tight and a frown on his face.\n\nSo some seconds passed, till suddenly Joyce whipped up his musket\nand fired. The report had scarcely died away ere it was repeated and\nrepeated from without in a scattering volley, shot behind shot, like\na string of geese, from every side of the enclosure. Several bullets\nstruck the log-house, but not one entered; and as the smoke cleared away\nand vanished, the stockade and the woods around it looked as quiet and\nempty as before. Not a bough waved, not the gleam of a musket-barrel\nbetrayed the presence of our foes.\n\n“Did you hit your man?” asked the captain.\n\n“No, sir,” replied Joyce. “I believe not, sir.”\n\n“Next best thing to tell the truth,” muttered Captain Smollett. “Load\nhis gun, Hawkins. How many should say there were on your side, doctor?”\n\n“I know precisely,” said Dr. Livesey. “Three shots were fired on this\nside. I saw the three flashes--two close together--one farther to the\nwest.”\n\n“Three!” repeated the captain. “And how many on yours, Mr. Trelawney?”\n\nBut this was not so easily answered. There had come many from the\nnorth--seven by the squire's computation, eight or nine according to\nGray. From the east and west only a single shot had been fired. It was\nplain, therefore, that the attack would be developed from the north and\nthat on the other three sides we were only to be annoyed by a show of\nhostilities. But Captain Smollett made no change in his arrangements. If\nthe mutineers succeeded in crossing the stockade, he argued, they would\ntake possession of any unprotected loophole and shoot us down like rats\nin our own stronghold.\n\nNor had we much time left to us for thought. Suddenly, with a loud\nhuzza, a little cloud of pirates leaped from the woods on the north side\nand ran straight on the stockade. At the same moment, the fire was once\nmore opened from the woods, and a rifle ball sang through the doorway\nand knocked the doctor's musket into bits.\n\nThe boarders swarmed over the fence like monkeys. Squire and Gray fired\nagain and yet again; three men fell, one forwards into the enclosure,\ntwo back on the outside. But of these, one was evidently more frightened\nthan hurt, for he was on his feet again in a crack and instantly\ndisappeared among the trees.\n\nTwo had bit the dust, one had fled, four had made good their footing\ninside our defences, while from the shelter of the woods seven or eight\nmen, each evidently supplied with several muskets, kept up a hot though\nuseless fire on the log-house.\n\nThe four who had boarded made straight before them for the building,\nshouting as they ran, and the men among the trees shouted back to\nencourage them. Several shots were fired, but such was the hurry of the\nmarksmen that not one appears to have taken effect. In a moment, the\nfour pirates had swarmed up the mound and were upon us.\n\nThe head of Job Anderson, the boatswain, appeared at the middle\nloophole.\n\n“At 'em, all hands--all hands!” he roared in a voice of thunder.\n\nAt the same moment, another pirate grasped Hunter's musket by the\nmuzzle, wrenched it from his hands, plucked it through the loophole,\nand with one stunning blow, laid the poor fellow senseless on the floor.\nMeanwhile a third, running unharmed all around the house, appeared\nsuddenly in the doorway and fell with his cutlass on the doctor.\n\nOur position was utterly reversed. A moment since we were firing, under\ncover, at an exposed enemy; now it was we who lay uncovered and could\nnot return a blow.\n\nThe log-house was full of smoke, to which we owed our comparative\nsafety. Cries and confusion, the flashes and reports of pistol-shots,\nand one loud groan rang in my ears.\n\n“Out, lads, out, and fight 'em in the open! Cutlasses!” cried the\ncaptain.\n\nI snatched a cutlass from the pile, and someone, at the same time\nsnatching another, gave me a cut across the knuckles which I hardly\nfelt. I dashed out of the door into the clear sunlight. Someone was\nclose behind, I knew not whom. Right in front, the doctor was pursuing\nhis assailant down the hill, and just as my eyes fell upon him, beat\ndown his guard and sent him sprawling on his back with a great slash\nacross the face.\n\n“Round the house, lads! Round the house!” cried the captain; and even in\nthe hurly-burly, I perceived a change in his voice.\n\nMechanically, I obeyed, turned eastwards, and with my cutlass raised,\nran round the corner of the house. Next moment I was face to face\nwith Anderson. He roared aloud, and his hanger went up above his head,\nflashing in the sunlight. I had not time to be afraid, but as the blow\nstill hung impending, leaped in a trice upon one side, and missing my\nfoot in the soft sand, rolled headlong down the slope.\n\nWhen I had first sallied from the door, the other mutineers had been\nalready swarming up the palisade to make an end of us. One man, in a red\nnight-cap, with his cutlass in his mouth, had even got upon the top and\nthrown a leg across. Well, so short had been the interval that when I\nfound my feet again all was in the same posture, the fellow with the red\nnight-cap still half-way over, another still just showing his head above\nthe top of the stockade. And yet, in this breath of time, the fight was\nover and the victory was ours.\n\nGray, following close behind me, had cut down the big boatswain ere\nhe had time to recover from his last blow. Another had been shot at a\nloophole in the very act of firing into the house and now lay in agony,\nthe pistol still smoking in his hand. A third, as I had seen, the doctor\nhad disposed of at a blow. Of the four who had scaled the palisade, one\nonly remained unaccounted for, and he, having left his cutlass on the\nfield, was now clambering out again with the fear of death upon him.\n\n“Fire--fire from the house!” cried the doctor. “And you, lads, back into\ncover.”\n\nBut his words were unheeded, no shot was fired, and the last boarder\nmade good his escape and disappeared with the rest into the wood. In\nthree seconds nothing remained of the attacking party but the five who\nhad fallen, four on the inside and one on the outside of the palisade.\n\nThe doctor and Gray and I ran full speed for shelter. The survivors\nwould soon be back where they had left their muskets, and at any moment\nthe fire might recommence.\n\nThe house was by this time somewhat cleared of smoke, and we saw at\na glance the price we had paid for victory. Hunter lay beside his\nloophole, stunned; Joyce by his, shot through the head, never to move\nagain; while right in the centre, the squire was supporting the captain,\none as pale as the other.\n\n“The captain's wounded,” said Mr. Trelawney.\n\n“Have they run?” asked Mr. Smollett.\n\n“All that could, you may be bound,” returned the doctor; “but there's\nfive of them will never run again.”\n\n“Five!” cried the captain. “Come, that's better. Five against three\nleaves us four to nine. That's better odds than we had at starting. We\nwere seven to nineteen then, or thought we were, and that's as bad to\nbear.” *\n\n*The mutineers were soon only eight in number, for the man shot by Mr.\nTrelawney on board the schooner died that same evening of his wound. But\nthis was, of course, not known till after by the faithful party.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPART FIVE--My Sea Adventure\n\n\n\n\n22\n\nHow My Sea Adventure Began\n\nTHERE was no return of the mutineers--not so much as another shot out of\nthe woods. They had “got their rations for that day,” as the captain put\nit, and we had the place to ourselves and a quiet time to overhaul the\nwounded and get dinner. Squire and I cooked outside in spite of the\ndanger, and even outside we could hardly tell what we were at, for\nhorror of the loud groans that reached us from the doctor's patients.\n\nOut of the eight men who had fallen in the action, only three still\nbreathed--that one of the pirates who had been shot at the loophole,\nHunter, and Captain Smollett; and of these, the first two were as good\nas dead; the mutineer indeed died under the doctor's knife, and Hunter,\ndo what we could, never recovered consciousness in this world. He\nlingered all day, breathing loudly like the old buccaneer at home in his\napoplectic fit, but the bones of his chest had been crushed by the\nblow and his skull fractured in falling, and some time in the following\nnight, without sign or sound, he went to his Maker.\n\nAs for the captain, his wounds were grievous indeed, but not dangerous.\nNo organ was fatally injured. Anderson's ball--for it was Job that\nshot him first--had broken his shoulder-blade and touched the lung, not\nbadly; the second had only torn and displaced some muscles in the calf.\nHe was sure to recover, the doctor said, but in the meantime, and for\nweeks to come, he must not walk nor move his arm, nor so much as speak\nwhen he could help it.\n\nMy own accidental cut across the knuckles was a flea-bite. Doctor\nLivesey patched it up with plaster and pulled my ears for me into the\nbargain.\n\nAfter dinner the squire and the doctor sat by the captain's side awhile\nin consultation; and when they had talked to their hearts' content, it\nbeing then a little past noon, the doctor took up his hat and pistols,\ngirt on a cutlass, put the chart in his pocket, and with a musket over\nhis shoulder crossed the palisade on the north side and set off briskly\nthrough the trees.\n\nGray and I were sitting together at the far end of the block house, to\nbe out of earshot of our officers consulting; and Gray took his pipe out\nof his mouth and fairly forgot to put it back again, so thunder-struck\nhe was at this occurrence.\n\n“Why, in the name of Davy Jones,” said he, “is Dr. Livesey mad?”\n\n“Why no,” says I. “He's about the last of this crew for that, I take\nit.”\n\n“Well, shipmate,” said Gray, “mad he may not be; but if HE'S not, you\nmark my words, I am.”\n\n“I take it,” replied I, “the doctor has his idea; and if I am right,\nhe's going now to see Ben Gunn.”\n\nI was right, as appeared later; but in the meantime, the house being\nstifling hot and the little patch of sand inside the palisade ablaze\nwith midday sun, I began to get another thought into my head, which was\nnot by any means so right. What I began to do was to envy the doctor\nwalking in the cool shadow of the woods with the birds about him and the\npleasant smell of the pines, while I sat grilling, with my clothes\nstuck to the hot resin, and so much blood about me and so many poor\ndead bodies lying all around that I took a disgust of the place that was\nalmost as strong as fear.\n\nAll the time I was washing out the block house, and then washing up\nthe things from dinner, this disgust and envy kept growing stronger\nand stronger, till at last, being near a bread-bag, and no one then\nobserving me, I took the first step towards my escapade and filled both\npockets of my coat with biscuit.\n\nI was a fool, if you like, and certainly I was going to do a foolish,\nover-bold act; but I was determined to do it with all the precautions in\nmy power. These biscuits, should anything befall me, would keep me, at\nleast, from starving till far on in the next day.\n\nThe next thing I laid hold of was a brace of pistols, and as I already\nhad a powder-horn and bullets, I felt myself well supplied with arms.\n\nAs for the scheme I had in my head, it was not a bad one in itself. I\nwas to go down the sandy spit that divides the anchorage on the east\nfrom the open sea, find the white rock I had observed last evening, and\nascertain whether it was there or not that Ben Gunn had hidden his boat,\na thing quite worth doing, as I still believe. But as I was certain I\nshould not be allowed to leave the enclosure, my only plan was to take\nFrench leave and slip out when nobody was watching, and that was so bad\na way of doing it as made the thing itself wrong. But I was only a boy,\nand I had made my mind up.\n\nWell, as things at last fell out, I found an admirable opportunity. The\nsquire and Gray were busy helping the captain with his bandages, the\ncoast was clear, I made a bolt for it over the stockade and into the\nthickest of the trees, and before my absence was observed I was out of\ncry of my companions.\n\nThis was my second folly, far worse than the first, as I left but two\nsound men to guard the house; but like the first, it was a help towards\nsaving all of us.\n\nI took my way straight for the east coast of the island, for I was\ndetermined to go down the sea side of the spit to avoid all chance of\nobservation from the anchorage. It was already late in the afternoon,\nalthough still warm and sunny. As I continued to thread the tall woods,\nI could hear from far before me not only the continuous thunder of the\nsurf, but a certain tossing of foliage and grinding of boughs which\nshowed me the sea breeze had set in higher than usual. Soon cool\ndraughts of air began to reach me, and a few steps farther I came forth\ninto the open borders of the grove, and saw the sea lying blue and sunny\nto the horizon and the surf tumbling and tossing its foam along the\nbeach.\n\nI have never seen the sea quiet round Treasure Island. The sun might\nblaze overhead, the air be without a breath, the surface smooth and\nblue, but still these great rollers would be running along all the\nexternal coast, thundering and thundering by day and night; and I scarce\nbelieve there is one spot in the island where a man would be out of\nearshot of their noise.\n\nI walked along beside the surf with great enjoyment, till, thinking\nI was now got far enough to the south, I took the cover of some thick\nbushes and crept warily up to the ridge of the spit.\n\nBehind me was the sea, in front the anchorage. The sea breeze, as though\nit had the sooner blown itself out by its unusual violence, was already\nat an end; it had been succeeded by light, variable airs from the south\nand south-east, carrying great banks of fog; and the anchorage, under\nlee of Skeleton Island, lay still and leaden as when first we entered\nit. The HISPANIOLA, in that unbroken mirror, was exactly portrayed from\nthe truck to the waterline, the Jolly Roger hanging from her peak.\n\nAlongside lay one of the gigs, Silver in the stern-sheets--him I could\nalways recognize--while a couple of men were leaning over the stern\nbulwarks, one of them with a red cap--the very rogue that I had seen\nsome hours before stride-legs upon the palisade. Apparently they were\ntalking and laughing, though at that distance--upwards of a mile--I\ncould, of course, hear no word of what was said. All at once there began\nthe most horrid, unearthly screaming, which at first startled me badly,\nthough I had soon remembered the voice of Captain Flint and even thought\nI could make out the bird by her bright plumage as she sat perched upon\nher master's wrist.\n\nSoon after, the jolly-boat shoved off and pulled for shore, and the man\nwith the red cap and his comrade went below by the cabin companion.\n\nJust about the same time, the sun had gone down behind the Spy-glass,\nand as the fog was collecting rapidly, it began to grow dark in earnest.\nI saw I must lose no time if I were to find the boat that evening.\n\nThe white rock, visible enough above the brush, was still some eighth of\na mile further down the spit, and it took me a goodish while to get up\nwith it, crawling, often on all fours, among the scrub. Night had almost\ncome when I laid my hand on its rough sides. Right below it there was\nan exceedingly small hollow of green turf, hidden by banks and a thick\nunderwood about knee-deep, that grew there very plentifully; and in the\ncentre of the dell, sure enough, a little tent of goat-skins, like what\nthe gipsies carry about with them in England.\n\nI dropped into the hollow, lifted the side of the tent, and there was\nBen Gunn's boat--home-made if ever anything was home-made; a rude,\nlop-sided framework of tough wood, and stretched upon that a covering of\ngoat-skin, with the hair inside. The thing was extremely small, even\nfor me, and I can hardly imagine that it could have floated with a\nfull-sized man. There was one thwart set as low as possible, a kind of\nstretcher in the bows, and a double paddle for propulsion.\n\nI had not then seen a coracle, such as the ancient Britons made, but\nI have seen one since, and I can give you no fairer idea of Ben Gunn's\nboat than by saying it was like the first and the worst coracle ever\nmade by man. But the great advantage of the coracle it certainly\npossessed, for it was exceedingly light and portable.\n\nWell, now that I had found the boat, you would have thought I had had\nenough of truantry for once, but in the meantime I had taken another\nnotion and become so obstinately fond of it that I would have carried\nit out, I believe, in the teeth of Captain Smollett himself. This was\nto slip out under cover of the night, cut the HISPANIOLA adrift, and let\nher go ashore where she fancied. I had quite made up my mind that the\nmutineers, after their repulse of the morning, had nothing nearer their\nhearts than to up anchor and away to sea; this, I thought, it would be\na fine thing to prevent, and now that I had seen how they left their\nwatchmen unprovided with a boat, I thought it might be done with little\nrisk.\n\nDown I sat to wait for darkness, and made a hearty meal of biscuit. It\nwas a night out of ten thousand for my purpose. The fog had now buried\nall heaven. As the last rays of daylight dwindled and disappeared,\nabsolute blackness settled down on Treasure Island. And when, at last,\nI shouldered the coracle and groped my way stumblingly out of the hollow\nwhere I had supped, there were but two points visible on the whole\nanchorage.\n\nOne was the great fire on shore, by which the defeated pirates lay\ncarousing in the swamp. The other, a mere blur of light upon the\ndarkness, indicated the position of the anchored ship. She had swung\nround to the ebb--her bow was now towards me--the only lights on board\nwere in the cabin, and what I saw was merely a reflection on the fog of\nthe strong rays that flowed from the stern window.\n\nThe ebb had already run some time, and I had to wade through a long belt\nof swampy sand, where I sank several times above the ankle, before I\ncame to the edge of the retreating water, and wading a little way in,\nwith some strength and dexterity, set my coracle, keel downwards, on the\nsurface.\n\n\n\n\n23\n\nThe Ebb-tide Runs\n\nTHE coracle--as I had ample reason to know before I was done with\nher--was a very safe boat for a person of my height and weight, both\nbuoyant and clever in a seaway; but she was the most cross-grained,\nlop-sided craft to manage. Do as you pleased, she always made more\nleeway than anything else, and turning round and round was the manoeuvre\nshe was best at. Even Ben Gunn himself has admitted that she was “queer\nto handle till you knew her way.”\n\nCertainly I did not know her way. She turned in every direction but the\none I was bound to go; the most part of the time we were broadside on,\nand I am very sure I never should have made the ship at all but for the\ntide. By good fortune, paddle as I pleased, the tide was still sweeping\nme down; and there lay the HISPANIOLA right in the fairway, hardly to be\nmissed.\n\nFirst she loomed before me like a blot of something yet blacker than\ndarkness, then her spars and hull began to take shape, and the next\nmoment, as it seemed (for, the farther I went, the brisker grew the\ncurrent of the ebb), I was alongside of her hawser and had laid hold.\n\nThe hawser was as taut as a bowstring, and the current so strong she\npulled upon her anchor. All round the hull, in the blackness, the\nrippling current bubbled and chattered like a little mountain stream.\nOne cut with my sea-gully and the HISPANIOLA would go humming down the\ntide.\n\nSo far so good, but it next occurred to my recollection that a taut\nhawser, suddenly cut, is a thing as dangerous as a kicking horse. Ten to\none, if I were so foolhardy as to cut the HISPANIOLA from her anchor, I\nand the coracle would be knocked clean out of the water.\n\nThis brought me to a full stop, and if fortune had not again\nparticularly favoured me, I should have had to abandon my design. But\nthe light airs which had begun blowing from the south-east and south\nhad hauled round after nightfall into the south-west. Just while I was\nmeditating, a puff came, caught the HISPANIOLA, and forced her up into\nthe current; and to my great joy, I felt the hawser slacken in my grasp,\nand the hand by which I held it dip for a second under water.\n\nWith that I made my mind up, took out my gully, opened it with my teeth,\nand cut one strand after another, till the vessel swung only by two.\nThen I lay quiet, waiting to sever these last when the strain should be\nonce more lightened by a breath of wind.\n\nAll this time I had heard the sound of loud voices from the cabin, but\nto say truth, my mind had been so entirely taken up with other thoughts\nthat I had scarcely given ear. Now, however, when I had nothing else to\ndo, I began to pay more heed.\n\nOne I recognized for the coxswain's, Israel Hands, that had been Flint's\ngunner in former days. The other was, of course, my friend of the red\nnight-cap. Both men were plainly the worse of drink, and they were still\ndrinking, for even while I was listening, one of them, with a drunken\ncry, opened the stern window and threw out something, which I divined to\nbe an empty bottle. But they were not only tipsy; it was plain that they\nwere furiously angry. Oaths flew like hailstones, and every now and\nthen there came forth such an explosion as I thought was sure to end\nin blows. But each time the quarrel passed off and the voices grumbled\nlower for a while, until the next crisis came and in its turn passed\naway without result.\n\nOn shore, I could see the glow of the great camp-fire burning warmly\nthrough the shore-side trees. Someone was singing, a dull, old, droning\nsailor's song, with a droop and a quaver at the end of every verse,\nand seemingly no end to it at all but the patience of the singer. I had\nheard it on the voyage more than once and remembered these words:\n\n     “But one man of her crew alive,\n     What put to sea with seventy-five.”\n\nAnd I thought it was a ditty rather too dolefully appropriate for a\ncompany that had met such cruel losses in the morning. But, indeed, from\nwhat I saw, all these buccaneers were as callous as the sea they sailed\non.\n\nAt last the breeze came; the schooner sidled and drew nearer in the\ndark; I felt the hawser slacken once more, and with a good, tough\neffort, cut the last fibres through.\n\nThe breeze had but little action on the coracle, and I was almost\ninstantly swept against the bows of the HISPANIOLA. At the same time,\nthe schooner began to turn upon her heel, spinning slowly, end for end,\nacross the current.\n\nI wrought like a fiend, for I expected every moment to be swamped; and\nsince I found I could not push the coracle directly off, I now shoved\nstraight astern. At length I was clear of my dangerous neighbour, and\njust as I gave the last impulsion, my hands came across a light cord\nthat was trailing overboard across the stern bulwarks. Instantly I\ngrasped it.\n\nWhy I should have done so I can hardly say. It was at first mere\ninstinct, but once I had it in my hands and found it fast, curiosity\nbegan to get the upper hand, and I determined I should have one look\nthrough the cabin window.\n\nI pulled in hand over hand on the cord, and when I judged myself near\nenough, rose at infinite risk to about half my height and thus commanded\nthe roof and a slice of the interior of the cabin.\n\nBy this time the schooner and her little consort were gliding pretty\nswiftly through the water; indeed, we had already fetched up level with\nthe camp-fire. The ship was talking, as sailors say, loudly, treading\nthe innumerable ripples with an incessant weltering splash; and until I\ngot my eye above the window-sill I could not comprehend why the watchmen\nhad taken no alarm. One glance, however, was sufficient; and it was\nonly one glance that I durst take from that unsteady skiff. It showed me\nHands and his companion locked together in deadly wrestle, each with a\nhand upon the other's throat.\n\nI dropped upon the thwart again, none too soon, for I was near\noverboard. I could see nothing for the moment but these two furious,\nencrimsoned faces swaying together under the smoky lamp, and I shut my\neyes to let them grow once more familiar with the darkness.\n\nThe endless ballad had come to an end at last, and the whole diminished\ncompany about the camp-fire had broken into the chorus I had heard so\noften:\n\n          “Fifteen men on the dead man's chest--\n              Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!\n           Drink and the devil had done for the rest--\n              Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!”\n\nI was just thinking how busy drink and the devil were at that very\nmoment in the cabin of the HISPANIOLA, when I was surprised by a sudden\nlurch of the coracle. At the same moment, she yawed sharply and seemed\nto change her course. The speed in the meantime had strangely increased.\n\nI opened my eyes at once. All round me were little ripples, combing\nover with a sharp, bristling sound and slightly phosphorescent. The\nHISPANIOLA herself, a few yards in whose wake I was still being whirled\nalong, seemed to stagger in her course, and I saw her spars toss a\nlittle against the blackness of the night; nay, as I looked longer, I\nmade sure she also was wheeling to the southward.\n\nI glanced over my shoulder, and my heart jumped against my ribs. There,\nright behind me, was the glow of the camp-fire. The current had turned\nat right angles, sweeping round along with it the tall schooner and\nthe little dancing coracle; ever quickening, ever bubbling higher, ever\nmuttering louder, it went spinning through the narrows for the open sea.\n\nSuddenly the schooner in front of me gave a violent yaw, turning,\nperhaps, through twenty degrees; and almost at the same moment one\nshout followed another from on board; I could hear feet pounding on\nthe companion ladder and I knew that the two drunkards had at last been\ninterrupted in their quarrel and awakened to a sense of their disaster.\n\nI lay down flat in the bottom of that wretched skiff and devoutly\nrecommended my spirit to its Maker. At the end of the straits, I\nmade sure we must fall into some bar of raging breakers, where all my\ntroubles would be ended speedily; and though I could, perhaps, bear to\ndie, I could not bear to look upon my fate as it approached.\n\nSo I must have lain for hours, continually beaten to and fro upon the\nbillows, now and again wetted with flying sprays, and never ceasing to\nexpect death at the next plunge. Gradually weariness grew upon me; a\nnumbness, an occasional stupor, fell upon my mind even in the midst of\nmy terrors, until sleep at last supervened and in my sea-tossed coracle\nI lay and dreamed of home and the old Admiral Benbow.\n\n\n\n\n24\n\nThe Cruise of the Coracle\n\nIT was broad day when I awoke and found myself tossing at the south-west\nend of Treasure Island. The sun was up but was still hid from me behind\nthe great bulk of the Spy-glass, which on this side descended almost to\nthe sea in formidable cliffs.\n\nHaulbowline Head and Mizzen-mast Hill were at my elbow, the hill bare\nand dark, the head bound with cliffs forty or fifty feet high and\nfringed with great masses of fallen rock. I was scarce a quarter of a\nmile to seaward, and it was my first thought to paddle in and land.\n\nThat notion was soon given over. Among the fallen rocks the breakers\nspouted and bellowed; loud reverberations, heavy sprays flying and\nfalling, succeeded one another from second to second; and I saw myself,\nif I ventured nearer, dashed to death upon the rough shore or spending\nmy strength in vain to scale the beetling crags.\n\nNor was that all, for crawling together on flat tables of rock or\nletting themselves drop into the sea with loud reports I beheld huge\nslimy monsters--soft snails, as it were, of incredible bigness--two\nor three score of them together, making the rocks to echo with their\nbarkings.\n\nI have understood since that they were sea lions, and entirely harmless.\nBut the look of them, added to the difficulty of the shore and the\nhigh running of the surf, was more than enough to disgust me of that\nlanding-place. I felt willing rather to starve at sea than to confront\nsuch perils.\n\nIn the meantime I had a better chance, as I supposed, before me. North\nof Haulbowline Head, the land runs in a long way, leaving at low tide\na long stretch of yellow sand. To the north of that, again, there comes\nanother cape--Cape of the Woods, as it was marked upon the chart--buried\nin tall green pines, which descended to the margin of the sea.\n\nI remembered what Silver had said about the current that sets northward\nalong the whole west coast of Treasure Island, and seeing from my\nposition that I was already under its influence, I preferred to leave\nHaulbowline Head behind me and reserve my strength for an attempt to\nland upon the kindlier-looking Cape of the Woods.\n\nThere was a great, smooth swell upon the sea. The wind blowing steady\nand gentle from the south, there was no contrariety between that and the\ncurrent, and the billows rose and fell unbroken.\n\nHad it been otherwise, I must long ago have perished; but as it was,\nit is surprising how easily and securely my little and light boat could\nride. Often, as I still lay at the bottom and kept no more than an eye\nabove the gunwale, I would see a big blue summit heaving close above me;\nyet the coracle would but bounce a little, dance as if on springs, and\nsubside on the other side into the trough as lightly as a bird.\n\nI began after a little to grow very bold and sat up to try my skill at\npaddling. But even a small change in the disposition of the weight will\nproduce violent changes in the behaviour of a coracle. And I had hardly\nmoved before the boat, giving up at once her gentle dancing movement,\nran straight down a slope of water so steep that it made me giddy, and\nstruck her nose, with a spout of spray, deep into the side of the next\nwave.\n\nI was drenched and terrified, and fell instantly back into my old\nposition, whereupon the coracle seemed to find her head again and led\nme as softly as before among the billows. It was plain she was not to be\ninterfered with, and at that rate, since I could in no way influence her\ncourse, what hope had I left of reaching land?\n\nI began to be horribly frightened, but I kept my head, for all that.\nFirst, moving with all care, I gradually baled out the coracle with my\nsea-cap; then, getting my eye once more above the gunwale, I set myself\nto study how it was she managed to slip so quietly through the rollers.\n\nI found each wave, instead of the big, smooth glossy mountain it looks\nfrom shore or from a vessel's deck, was for all the world like any range\nof hills on dry land, full of peaks and smooth places and valleys. The\ncoracle, left to herself, turning from side to side, threaded, so to\nspeak, her way through these lower parts and avoided the steep slopes\nand higher, toppling summits of the wave.\n\n“Well, now,” thought I to myself, “it is plain I must lie where I am and\nnot disturb the balance; but it is plain also that I can put the paddle\nover the side and from time to time, in smooth places, give her a shove\nor two towards land.” No sooner thought upon than done. There I lay on\nmy elbows in the most trying attitude, and every now and again gave a\nweak stroke or two to turn her head to shore.\n\nIt was very tiring and slow work, yet I did visibly gain ground; and as\nwe drew near the Cape of the Woods, though I saw I must infallibly\nmiss that point, I had still made some hundred yards of easting. I was,\nindeed, close in. I could see the cool green tree-tops swaying together\nin the breeze, and I felt sure I should make the next promontory without\nfail.\n\nIt was high time, for I now began to be tortured with thirst. The glow\nof the sun from above, its thousandfold reflection from the waves, the\nsea-water that fell and dried upon me, caking my very lips with salt,\ncombined to make my throat burn and my brain ache. The sight of the\ntrees so near at hand had almost made me sick with longing, but the\ncurrent had soon carried me past the point, and as the next reach of sea\nopened out, I beheld a sight that changed the nature of my thoughts.\n\nRight in front of me, not half a mile away, I beheld the HISPANIOLA\nunder sail. I made sure, of course, that I should be taken; but I was\nso distressed for want of water that I scarce knew whether to be glad\nor sorry at the thought, and long before I had come to a conclusion,\nsurprise had taken entire possession of my mind and I could do nothing\nbut stare and wonder.\n\nThe HISPANIOLA was under her main-sail and two jibs, and the beautiful\nwhite canvas shone in the sun like snow or silver. When I first\nsighted her, all her sails were drawing; she was lying a course about\nnorth-west, and I presumed the men on board were going round the island\non their way back to the anchorage. Presently she began to fetch more\nand more to the westward, so that I thought they had sighted me and were\ngoing about in chase. At last, however, she fell right into the wind's\neye, was taken dead aback, and stood there awhile helpless, with her\nsails shivering.\n\n“Clumsy fellows,” said I; “they must still be drunk as owls.” And I\nthought how Captain Smollett would have set them skipping.\n\nMeanwhile the schooner gradually fell off and filled again upon another\ntack, sailed swiftly for a minute or so, and brought up once more dead\nin the wind's eye. Again and again was this repeated. To and fro, up and\ndown, north, south, east, and west, the HISPANIOLA sailed by swoops\nand dashes, and at each repetition ended as she had begun, with idly\nflapping canvas. It became plain to me that nobody was steering. And if\nso, where were the men? Either they were dead drunk or had deserted her,\nI thought, and perhaps if I could get on board I might return the vessel\nto her captain.\n\nThe current was bearing coracle and schooner southward at an equal rate.\nAs for the latter's sailing, it was so wild and intermittent, and she\nhung each time so long in irons, that she certainly gained nothing, if\nshe did not even lose. If only I dared to sit up and paddle, I made\nsure that I could overhaul her. The scheme had an air of adventure\nthat inspired me, and the thought of the water breaker beside the fore\ncompanion doubled my growing courage.\n\nUp I got, was welcomed almost instantly by another cloud of spray, but\nthis time stuck to my purpose and set myself, with all my strength and\ncaution, to paddle after the unsteered HISPANIOLA. Once I shipped a sea\nso heavy that I had to stop and bail, with my heart fluttering like\na bird, but gradually I got into the way of the thing and guided my\ncoracle among the waves, with only now and then a blow upon her bows and\na dash of foam in my face.\n\nI was now gaining rapidly on the schooner; I could see the brass glisten\non the tiller as it banged about, and still no soul appeared upon her\ndecks. I could not choose but suppose she was deserted. If not, the men\nwere lying drunk below, where I might batten them down, perhaps, and do\nwhat I chose with the ship.\n\nFor some time she had been doing the worse thing possible for\nme--standing still. She headed nearly due south, yawing, of course, all\nthe time. Each time she fell off, her sails partly filled, and these\nbrought her in a moment right to the wind again. I have said this was\nthe worst thing possible for me, for helpless as she looked in this\nsituation, with the canvas cracking like cannon and the blocks trundling\nand banging on the deck, she still continued to run away from me, not\nonly with the speed of the current, but by the whole amount of her\nleeway, which was naturally great.\n\nBut now, at last, I had my chance. The breeze fell for some seconds,\nvery low, and the current gradually turning her, the HISPANIOLA revolved\nslowly round her centre and at last presented me her stern, with the\ncabin window still gaping open and the lamp over the table still burning\non into the day. The main-sail hung drooped like a banner. She was\nstock-still but for the current.\n\nFor the last little while I had even lost, but now redoubling my\nefforts, I began once more to overhaul the chase.\n\nI was not a hundred yards from her when the wind came again in a clap;\nshe filled on the port tack and was off again, stooping and skimming\nlike a swallow.\n\nMy first impulse was one of despair, but my second was towards joy.\nRound she came, till she was broadside on to me--round still till she\nhad covered a half and then two thirds and then three quarters of the\ndistance that separated us. I could see the waves boiling white under\nher forefoot. Immensely tall she looked to me from my low station in the\ncoracle.\n\nAnd then, of a sudden, I began to comprehend. I had scarce time to\nthink--scarce time to act and save myself. I was on the summit of one\nswell when the schooner came stooping over the next. The bowsprit was\nover my head. I sprang to my feet and leaped, stamping the coracle under\nwater. With one hand I caught the jib-boom, while my foot was lodged\nbetween the stay and the brace; and as I still clung there panting, a\ndull blow told me that the schooner had charged down upon and struck the\ncoracle and that I was left without retreat on the HISPANIOLA.\n\n\n\n\n25\n\nI Strike the Jolly Roger\n\nI HAD scarce gained a position on the bowsprit when the flying jib\nflapped and filled upon the other tack, with a report like a gun. The\nschooner trembled to her keel under the reverse, but next moment, the\nother sails still drawing, the jib flapped back again and hung idle.\n\nThis had nearly tossed me off into the sea; and now I lost no time,\ncrawled back along the bowsprit, and tumbled head foremost on the deck.\n\nI was on the lee side of the forecastle, and the mainsail, which was\nstill drawing, concealed from me a certain portion of the after-deck.\nNot a soul was to be seen. The planks, which had not been swabbed since\nthe mutiny, bore the print of many feet, and an empty bottle, broken by\nthe neck, tumbled to and fro like a live thing in the scuppers.\n\nSuddenly the HISPANIOLA came right into the wind. The jibs behind me\ncracked aloud, the rudder slammed to, the whole ship gave a sickening\nheave and shudder, and at the same moment the main-boom swung inboard,\nthe sheet groaning in the blocks, and showed me the lee after-deck.\n\nThere were the two watchmen, sure enough: red-cap on his back, as stiff\nas a handspike, with his arms stretched out like those of a crucifix and\nhis teeth showing through his open lips; Israel Hands propped against\nthe bulwarks, his chin on his chest, his hands lying open before him on\nthe deck, his face as white, under its tan, as a tallow candle.\n\nFor a while the ship kept bucking and sidling like a vicious horse, the\nsails filling, now on one tack, now on another, and the boom swinging to\nand fro till the mast groaned aloud under the strain. Now and again too\nthere would come a cloud of light sprays over the bulwark and a heavy\nblow of the ship's bows against the swell; so much heavier weather was\nmade of it by this great rigged ship than by my home-made, lop-sided\ncoracle, now gone to the bottom of the sea.\n\nAt every jump of the schooner, red-cap slipped to and fro, but--what was\nghastly to behold--neither his attitude nor his fixed teeth-disclosing\ngrin was anyway disturbed by this rough usage. At every jump too, Hands\nappeared still more to sink into himself and settle down upon the\ndeck, his feet sliding ever the farther out, and the whole body canting\ntowards the stern, so that his face became, little by little, hid\nfrom me; and at last I could see nothing beyond his ear and the frayed\nringlet of one whisker.\n\nAt the same time, I observed, around both of them, splashes of dark\nblood upon the planks and began to feel sure that they had killed each\nother in their drunken wrath.\n\nWhile I was thus looking and wondering, in a calm moment, when the ship\nwas still, Israel Hands turned partly round and with a low moan writhed\nhimself back to the position in which I had seen him first. The moan,\nwhich told of pain and deadly weakness, and the way in which his jaw\nhung open went right to my heart. But when I remembered the talk I had\noverheard from the apple barrel, all pity left me.\n\nI walked aft until I reached the main-mast.\n\n“Come aboard, Mr. Hands,” I said ironically.\n\nHe rolled his eyes round heavily, but he was too far gone to express\nsurprise. All he could do was to utter one word, “Brandy.”\n\nIt occurred to me there was no time to lose, and dodging the boom as it\nonce more lurched across the deck, I slipped aft and down the companion\nstairs into the cabin.\n\nIt was such a scene of confusion as you can hardly fancy. All the\nlockfast places had been broken open in quest of the chart. The floor\nwas thick with mud where ruffians had sat down to drink or consult after\nwading in the marshes round their camp. The bulkheads, all painted in\nclear white and beaded round with gilt, bore a pattern of dirty hands.\nDozens of empty bottles clinked together in corners to the rolling of\nthe ship. One of the doctor's medical books lay open on the table, half\nof the leaves gutted out, I suppose, for pipelights. In the midst of all\nthis the lamp still cast a smoky glow, obscure and brown as umber.\n\nI went into the cellar; all the barrels were gone, and of the bottles\na most surprising number had been drunk out and thrown away. Certainly,\nsince the mutiny began, not a man of them could ever have been sober.\n\nForaging about, I found a bottle with some brandy left, for Hands; and\nfor myself I routed out some biscuit, some pickled fruits, a great bunch\nof raisins, and a piece of cheese. With these I came on deck, put down\nmy own stock behind the rudder head and well out of the coxswain's\nreach, went forward to the water-breaker, and had a good deep drink of\nwater, and then, and not till then, gave Hands the brandy.\n\nHe must have drunk a gill before he took the bottle from his mouth.\n\n“Aye,” said he, “by thunder, but I wanted some o' that!”\n\nI had sat down already in my own corner and begun to eat.\n\n“Much hurt?” I asked him.\n\nHe grunted, or rather, I might say, he barked.\n\n“If that doctor was aboard,” he said, “I'd be right enough in a couple\nof turns, but I don't have no manner of luck, you see, and that's what's\nthe matter with me. As for that swab, he's good and dead, he is,” he\nadded, indicating the man with the red cap. “He warn't no seaman anyhow.\nAnd where mought you have come from?”\n\n“Well,” said I, “I've come aboard to take possession of this ship,\nMr. Hands; and you'll please regard me as your captain until further\nnotice.”\n\nHe looked at me sourly enough but said nothing. Some of the colour had\ncome back into his cheeks, though he still looked very sick and still\ncontinued to slip out and settle down as the ship banged about.\n\n“By the by,” I continued, “I can't have these colours, Mr. Hands; and by\nyour leave, I'll strike 'em. Better none than these.”\n\nAnd again dodging the boom, I ran to the colour lines, handed down their\ncursed black flag, and chucked it overboard.\n\n“God save the king!” said I, waving my cap. “And there's an end to\nCaptain Silver!”\n\nHe watched me keenly and slyly, his chin all the while on his breast.\n\n“I reckon,” he said at last, “I reckon, Cap'n Hawkins, you'll kind of\nwant to get ashore now. S'pose we talks.”\n\n“Why, yes,” says I, “with all my heart, Mr. Hands. Say on.” And I went\nback to my meal with a good appetite.\n\n“This man,” he began, nodding feebly at the corpse “--O'Brien were his\nname, a rank Irelander--this man and me got the canvas on her, meaning\nfor to sail her back. Well, HE'S dead now, he is--as dead as bilge; and\nwho's to sail this ship, I don't see. Without I gives you a hint, you\nain't that man, as far's I can tell. Now, look here, you gives me food\nand drink and a old scarf or ankecher to tie my wound up, you do, and\nI'll tell you how to sail her, and that's about square all round, I take\nit.”\n\n“I'll tell you one thing,” says I: “I'm not going back to Captain Kidd's\nanchorage. I mean to get into North Inlet and beach her quietly there.”\n\n“To be sure you did,” he cried. “Why, I ain't sich an infernal lubber\nafter all. I can see, can't I? I've tried my fling, I have, and I've\nlost, and it's you has the wind of me. North Inlet? Why, I haven't no\nch'ice, not I! I'd help you sail her up to Execution Dock, by thunder!\nSo I would.”\n\nWell, as it seemed to me, there was some sense in this. We struck our\nbargain on the spot. In three minutes I had the HISPANIOLA sailing\neasily before the wind along the coast of Treasure Island, with good\nhopes of turning the northern point ere noon and beating down again as\nfar as North Inlet before high water, when we might beach her safely and\nwait till the subsiding tide permitted us to land.\n\nThen I lashed the tiller and went below to my own chest, where I got a\nsoft silk handkerchief of my mother's. With this, and with my aid, Hands\nbound up the great bleeding stab he had received in the thigh, and after\nhe had eaten a little and had a swallow or two more of the brandy, he\nbegan to pick up visibly, sat straighter up, spoke louder and clearer,\nand looked in every way another man.\n\nThe breeze served us admirably. We skimmed before it like a bird, the\ncoast of the island flashing by and the view changing every minute.\nSoon we were past the high lands and bowling beside low, sandy country,\nsparsely dotted with dwarf pines, and soon we were beyond that again\nand had turned the corner of the rocky hill that ends the island on the\nnorth.\n\nI was greatly elated with my new command, and pleased with the bright,\nsunshiny weather and these different prospects of the coast. I had now\nplenty of water and good things to eat, and my conscience, which had\nsmitten me hard for my desertion, was quieted by the great conquest I\nhad made. I should, I think, have had nothing left me to desire but for\nthe eyes of the coxswain as they followed me derisively about the deck\nand the odd smile that appeared continually on his face. It was a smile\nthat had in it something both of pain and weakness--a haggard old man's\nsmile; but there was, besides that, a grain of derision, a shadow of\ntreachery, in his expression as he craftily watched, and watched, and\nwatched me at my work.\n\n\n\n\n26\n\nIsrael Hands\n\nTHE wind, serving us to a desire, now hauled into the west. We could run\nso much the easier from the north-east corner of the island to the mouth\nof the North Inlet. Only, as we had no power to anchor and dared not\nbeach her till the tide had flowed a good deal farther, time hung on our\nhands. The coxswain told me how to lay the ship to; after a good many\ntrials I succeeded, and we both sat in silence over another meal.\n\n“Cap'n,” said he at length with that same uncomfortable smile, “here's\nmy old shipmate, O'Brien; s'pose you was to heave him overboard. I ain't\npartic'lar as a rule, and I don't take no blame for settling his hash,\nbut I don't reckon him ornamental now, do you?”\n\n“I'm not strong enough, and I don't like the job; and there he lies, for\nme,” said I.\n\n“This here's an unlucky ship, this HISPANIOLA, Jim,” he went on,\nblinking. “There's a power of men been killed in this HISPANIOLA--a\nsight o' poor seamen dead and gone since you and me took ship to\nBristol. I never seen sich dirty luck, not I. There was this here\nO'Brien now--he's dead, ain't he? Well now, I'm no scholar, and you're a\nlad as can read and figure, and to put it straight, do you take it as a\ndead man is dead for good, or do he come alive again?”\n\n“You can kill the body, Mr. Hands, but not the spirit; you must know\nthat already,” I replied. “O'Brien there is in another world, and may be\nwatching us.”\n\n“Ah!” says he. “Well, that's unfort'nate--appears as if killing parties\nwas a waste of time. Howsomever, sperrits don't reckon for much, by what\nI've seen. I'll chance it with the sperrits, Jim. And now, you've spoke\nup free, and I'll take it kind if you'd step down into that there cabin\nand get me a--well, a--shiver my timbers! I can't hit the name on 't;\nwell, you get me a bottle of wine, Jim--this here brandy's too strong\nfor my head.”\n\nNow, the coxswain's hesitation seemed to be unnatural, and as for the\nnotion of his preferring wine to brandy, I entirely disbelieved it. The\nwhole story was a pretext. He wanted me to leave the deck--so much was\nplain; but with what purpose I could in no way imagine. His eyes never\nmet mine; they kept wandering to and fro, up and down, now with a look\nto the sky, now with a flitting glance upon the dead O'Brien. All the\ntime he kept smiling and putting his tongue out in the most guilty,\nembarrassed manner, so that a child could have told that he was bent on\nsome deception. I was prompt with my answer, however, for I saw where\nmy advantage lay and that with a fellow so densely stupid I could easily\nconceal my suspicions to the end.\n\n“Some wine?” I said. “Far better. Will you have white or red?”\n\n“Well, I reckon it's about the blessed same to me, shipmate,” he\nreplied; “so it's strong, and plenty of it, what's the odds?”\n\n“All right,” I answered. “I'll bring you port, Mr. Hands. But I'll have\nto dig for it.”\n\nWith that I scuttled down the companion with all the noise I could,\nslipped off my shoes, ran quietly along the sparred gallery, mounted the\nforecastle ladder, and popped my head out of the fore companion. I\nknew he would not expect to see me there, yet I took every precaution\npossible, and certainly the worst of my suspicions proved too true.\n\nHe had risen from his position to his hands and knees, and though his\nleg obviously hurt him pretty sharply when he moved--for I could hear\nhim stifle a groan--yet it was at a good, rattling rate that he trailed\nhimself across the deck. In half a minute he had reached the port\nscuppers and picked, out of a coil of rope, a long knife, or rather a\nshort dirk, discoloured to the hilt with blood. He looked upon it for\na moment, thrusting forth his under jaw, tried the point upon his hand,\nand then, hastily concealing it in the bosom of his jacket, trundled\nback again into his old place against the bulwark.\n\nThis was all that I required to know. Israel could move about, he was\nnow armed, and if he had been at so much trouble to get rid of me,\nit was plain that I was meant to be the victim. What he would do\nafterwards--whether he would try to crawl right across the island from\nNorth Inlet to the camp among the swamps or whether he would fire Long\nTom, trusting that his own comrades might come first to help him--was,\nof course, more than I could say.\n\nYet I felt sure that I could trust him in one point, since in that\nour interests jumped together, and that was in the disposition of\nthe schooner. We both desired to have her stranded safe enough, in a\nsheltered place, and so that, when the time came, she could be got off\nagain with as little labour and danger as might be; and until that was\ndone I considered that my life would certainly be spared.\n\nWhile I was thus turning the business over in my mind, I had not been\nidle with my body. I had stolen back to the cabin, slipped once more\ninto my shoes, and laid my hand at random on a bottle of wine, and now,\nwith this for an excuse, I made my reappearance on the deck.\n\nHands lay as I had left him, all fallen together in a bundle and with\nhis eyelids lowered as though he were too weak to bear the light. He\nlooked up, however, at my coming, knocked the neck off the bottle like\na man who had done the same thing often, and took a good swig, with his\nfavourite toast of “Here's luck!” Then he lay quiet for a little, and\nthen, pulling out a stick of tobacco, begged me to cut him a quid.\n\n“Cut me a junk o' that,” says he, “for I haven't no knife and hardly\nstrength enough, so be as I had. Ah, Jim, Jim, I reckon I've missed\nstays! Cut me a quid, as'll likely be the last, lad, for I'm for my long\nhome, and no mistake.”\n\n“Well,” said I, “I'll cut you some tobacco, but if I was you and thought\nmyself so badly, I would go to my prayers like a Christian man.”\n\n“Why?” said he. “Now, you tell me why.”\n\n“Why?” I cried. “You were asking me just now about the dead. You've\nbroken your trust; you've lived in sin and lies and blood; there's a man\nyou killed lying at your feet this moment, and you ask me why! For God's\nmercy, Mr. Hands, that's why.”\n\nI spoke with a little heat, thinking of the bloody dirk he had hidden\nin his pocket and designed, in his ill thoughts, to end me with. He,\nfor his part, took a great draught of the wine and spoke with the most\nunusual solemnity.\n\n“For thirty years,” he said, “I've sailed the seas and seen good and\nbad, better and worse, fair weather and foul, provisions running out,\nknives going, and what not. Well, now I tell you, I never seen good come\no' goodness yet. Him as strikes first is my fancy; dead men don't bite;\nthem's my views--amen, so be it. And now, you look here,” he added,\nsuddenly changing his tone, “we've had about enough of this foolery. The\ntide's made good enough by now. You just take my orders, Cap'n Hawkins,\nand we'll sail slap in and be done with it.”\n\nAll told, we had scarce two miles to run; but the navigation was\ndelicate, the entrance to this northern anchorage was not only narrow\nand shoal, but lay east and west, so that the schooner must be nicely\nhandled to be got in. I think I was a good, prompt subaltern, and I am\nvery sure that Hands was an excellent pilot, for we went about and about\nand dodged in, shaving the banks, with a certainty and a neatness that\nwere a pleasure to behold.\n\nScarcely had we passed the heads before the land closed around us. The\nshores of North Inlet were as thickly wooded as those of the southern\nanchorage, but the space was longer and narrower and more like, what in\ntruth it was, the estuary of a river. Right before us, at the southern\nend, we saw the wreck of a ship in the last stages of dilapidation. It\nhad been a great vessel of three masts but had lain so long exposed to\nthe injuries of the weather that it was hung about with great webs of\ndripping seaweed, and on the deck of it shore bushes had taken root and\nnow flourished thick with flowers. It was a sad sight, but it showed us\nthat the anchorage was calm.\n\n“Now,” said Hands, “look there; there's a pet bit for to beach a ship\nin. Fine flat sand, never a cat's paw, trees all around of it, and\nflowers a-blowing like a garding on that old ship.”\n\n“And once beached,” I inquired, “how shall we get her off again?”\n\n“Why, so,” he replied: “you take a line ashore there on the other side\nat low water, take a turn about one of them big pines; bring it back,\ntake a turn around the capstan, and lie to for the tide. Come high\nwater, all hands take a pull upon the line, and off she comes as sweet\nas natur'. And now, boy, you stand by. We're near the bit now, and she's\ntoo much way on her. Starboard a little--so--steady--starboard--larboard\na little--steady--steady!”\n\nSo he issued his commands, which I breathlessly obeyed, till, all of a\nsudden, he cried, “Now, my hearty, luff!” And I put the helm hard up,\nand the HISPANIOLA swung round rapidly and ran stem on for the low,\nwooded shore.\n\nThe excitement of these last manoeuvres had somewhat interfered with the\nwatch I had kept hitherto, sharply enough, upon the coxswain. Even then\nI was still so much interested, waiting for the ship to touch, that I\nhad quite forgot the peril that hung over my head and stood craning over\nthe starboard bulwarks and watching the ripples spreading wide before\nthe bows. I might have fallen without a struggle for my life had not a\nsudden disquietude seized upon me and made me turn my head. Perhaps I\nhad heard a creak or seen his shadow moving with the tail of my eye;\nperhaps it was an instinct like a cat's; but, sure enough, when I looked\nround, there was Hands, already half-way towards me, with the dirk in\nhis right hand.\n\nWe must both have cried out aloud when our eyes met, but while mine\nwas the shrill cry of terror, his was a roar of fury like a charging\nbully's. At the same instant, he threw himself forward and I leapt\nsideways towards the bows. As I did so, I let go of the tiller, which\nsprang sharp to leeward, and I think this saved my life, for it struck\nHands across the chest and stopped him, for the moment, dead.\n\nBefore he could recover, I was safe out of the corner where he had me\ntrapped, with all the deck to dodge about. Just forward of the main-mast\nI stopped, drew a pistol from my pocket, took a cool aim, though he had\nalready turned and was once more coming directly after me, and drew the\ntrigger. The hammer fell, but there followed neither flash nor sound;\nthe priming was useless with sea-water. I cursed myself for my neglect.\nWhy had not I, long before, reprimed and reloaded my only weapons? Then\nI should not have been as now, a mere fleeing sheep before this butcher.\n\nWounded as he was, it was wonderful how fast he could move, his grizzled\nhair tumbling over his face, and his face itself as red as a red ensign\nwith his haste and fury. I had no time to try my other pistol, nor\nindeed much inclination, for I was sure it would be useless. One thing I\nsaw plainly: I must not simply retreat before him, or he would speedily\nhold me boxed into the bows, as a moment since he had so nearly boxed\nme in the stern. Once so caught, and nine or ten inches of the\nblood-stained dirk would be my last experience on this side of eternity.\nI placed my palms against the main-mast, which was of a goodish bigness,\nand waited, every nerve upon the stretch.\n\nSeeing that I meant to dodge, he also paused; and a moment or two passed\nin feints on his part and corresponding movements upon mine. It was such\na game as I had often played at home about the rocks of Black Hill Cove,\nbut never before, you may be sure, with such a wildly beating heart as\nnow. Still, as I say, it was a boy's game, and I thought I could hold\nmy own at it against an elderly seaman with a wounded thigh. Indeed my\ncourage had begun to rise so high that I allowed myself a few darting\nthoughts on what would be the end of the affair, and while I saw\ncertainly that I could spin it out for long, I saw no hope of any\nultimate escape.\n\nWell, while things stood thus, suddenly the HISPANIOLA struck,\nstaggered, ground for an instant in the sand, and then, swift as a\nblow, canted over to the port side till the deck stood at an angle\nof forty-five degrees and about a puncheon of water splashed into the\nscupper holes and lay, in a pool, between the deck and bulwark.\n\nWe were both of us capsized in a second, and both of us rolled, almost\ntogether, into the scuppers, the dead red-cap, with his arms still\nspread out, tumbling stiffly after us. So near were we, indeed, that my\nhead came against the coxswain's foot with a crack that made my teeth\nrattle. Blow and all, I was the first afoot again, for Hands had got\ninvolved with the dead body. The sudden canting of the ship had made the\ndeck no place for running on; I had to find some new way of escape,\nand that upon the instant, for my foe was almost touching me. Quick as\nthought, I sprang into the mizzen shrouds, rattled up hand over hand,\nand did not draw a breath till I was seated on the cross-trees.\n\nI had been saved by being prompt; the dirk had struck not half a foot\nbelow me as I pursued my upward flight; and there stood Israel Hands\nwith his mouth open and his face upturned to mine, a perfect statue of\nsurprise and disappointment.\n\nNow that I had a moment to myself, I lost no time in changing the\npriming of my pistol, and then, having one ready for service, and to\nmake assurance doubly sure, I proceeded to draw the load of the other\nand recharge it afresh from the beginning.\n\nMy new employment struck Hands all of a heap; he began to see the dice\ngoing against him, and after an obvious hesitation, he also hauled\nhimself heavily into the shrouds, and with the dirk in his teeth, began\nslowly and painfully to mount. It cost him no end of time and groans\nto haul his wounded leg behind him, and I had quietly finished my\narrangements before he was much more than a third of the way up. Then,\nwith a pistol in either hand, I addressed him.\n\n“One more step, Mr. Hands,” said I, “and I'll blow your brains out! Dead\nmen don't bite, you know,” I added with a chuckle.\n\nHe stopped instantly. I could see by the working of his face that he was\ntrying to think, and the process was so slow and laborious that, in my\nnew-found security, I laughed aloud. At last, with a swallow or two, he\nspoke, his face still wearing the same expression of extreme perplexity.\nIn order to speak he had to take the dagger from his mouth, but in all\nelse he remained unmoved.\n\n“Jim,” says he, “I reckon we're fouled, you and me, and we'll have to\nsign articles. I'd have had you but for that there lurch, but I don't\nhave no luck, not I; and I reckon I'll have to strike, which comes hard,\nyou see, for a master mariner to a ship's younker like you, Jim.”\n\nI was drinking in his words and smiling away, as conceited as a cock\nupon a wall, when, all in a breath, back went his right hand over his\nshoulder. Something sang like an arrow through the air; I felt a blow\nand then a sharp pang, and there I was pinned by the shoulder to the\nmast. In the horrid pain and surprise of the moment--I scarce can say\nit was by my own volition, and I am sure it was without a conscious\naim--both my pistols went off, and both escaped out of my hands. They\ndid not fall alone; with a choked cry, the coxswain loosed his grasp\nupon the shrouds and plunged head first into the water.\n\n\n\n\n27\n\n“Pieces of Eight”\n\nOWING to the cant of the vessel, the masts hung far out over the water,\nand from my perch on the cross-trees I had nothing below me but the\nsurface of the bay. Hands, who was not so far up, was in consequence\nnearer to the ship and fell between me and the bulwarks. He rose once to\nthe surface in a lather of foam and blood and then sank again for good.\nAs the water settled, I could see him lying huddled together on the\nclean, bright sand in the shadow of the vessel's sides. A fish or two\nwhipped past his body. Sometimes, by the quivering of the water, he\nappeared to move a little, as if he were trying to rise. But he was dead\nenough, for all that, being both shot and drowned, and was food for fish\nin the very place where he had designed my slaughter.\n\nI was no sooner certain of this than I began to feel sick, faint, and\nterrified. The hot blood was running over my back and chest. The dirk,\nwhere it had pinned my shoulder to the mast, seemed to burn like a hot\niron; yet it was not so much these real sufferings that distressed me,\nfor these, it seemed to me, I could bear without a murmur; it was the\nhorror I had upon my mind of falling from the cross-trees into that\nstill green water, beside the body of the coxswain.\n\nI clung with both hands till my nails ached, and I shut my eyes as if to\ncover up the peril. Gradually my mind came back again, my pulses quieted\ndown to a more natural time, and I was once more in possession of\nmyself.\n\nIt was my first thought to pluck forth the dirk, but either it stuck too\nhard or my nerve failed me, and I desisted with a violent shudder. Oddly\nenough, that very shudder did the business. The knife, in fact, had come\nthe nearest in the world to missing me altogether; it held me by a mere\npinch of skin, and this the shudder tore away. The blood ran down the\nfaster, to be sure, but I was my own master again and only tacked to the\nmast by my coat and shirt.\n\nThese last I broke through with a sudden jerk, and then regained the\ndeck by the starboard shrouds. For nothing in the world would I have\nagain ventured, shaken as I was, upon the overhanging port shrouds from\nwhich Israel had so lately fallen.\n\nI went below and did what I could for my wound; it pained me a good deal\nand still bled freely, but it was neither deep nor dangerous, nor did it\ngreatly gall me when I used my arm. Then I looked around me, and as the\nship was now, in a sense, my own, I began to think of clearing it from\nits last passenger--the dead man, O'Brien.\n\nHe had pitched, as I have said, against the bulwarks, where he lay\nlike some horrible, ungainly sort of puppet, life-size, indeed, but how\ndifferent from life's colour or life's comeliness! In that position\nI could easily have my way with him, and as the habit of tragical\nadventures had worn off almost all my terror for the dead, I took him\nby the waist as if he had been a sack of bran and with one good heave,\ntumbled him overboard. He went in with a sounding plunge; the red cap\ncame off and remained floating on the surface; and as soon as the splash\nsubsided, I could see him and Israel lying side by side, both wavering\nwith the tremulous movement of the water. O'Brien, though still quite a\nyoung man, was very bald. There he lay, with that bald head across the\nknees of the man who had killed him and the quick fishes steering to and\nfro over both.\n\nI was now alone upon the ship; the tide had just turned. The sun was\nwithin so few degrees of setting that already the shadow of the pines\nupon the western shore began to reach right across the anchorage and\nfall in patterns on the deck. The evening breeze had sprung up, and\nthough it was well warded off by the hill with the two peaks upon the\neast, the cordage had begun to sing a little softly to itself and the\nidle sails to rattle to and fro.\n\nI began to see a danger to the ship. The jibs I speedily doused and\nbrought tumbling to the deck, but the main-sail was a harder matter. Of\ncourse, when the schooner canted over, the boom had swung out-board, and\nthe cap of it and a foot or two of sail hung even under water. I thought\nthis made it still more dangerous; yet the strain was so heavy that I\nhalf feared to meddle. At last I got my knife and cut the halyards. The\npeak dropped instantly, a great belly of loose canvas floated broad upon\nthe water, and since, pull as I liked, I could not budge the downhall,\nthat was the extent of what I could accomplish. For the rest, the\nHISPANIOLA must trust to luck, like myself.\n\nBy this time the whole anchorage had fallen into shadow--the last rays,\nI remember, falling through a glade of the wood and shining bright as\njewels on the flowery mantle of the wreck. It began to be chill; the\ntide was rapidly fleeting seaward, the schooner settling more and more\non her beam-ends.\n\nI scrambled forward and looked over. It seemed shallow enough, and\nholding the cut hawser in both hands for a last security, I let myself\ndrop softly overboard. The water scarcely reached my waist; the sand was\nfirm and covered with ripple marks, and I waded ashore in great spirits,\nleaving the HISPANIOLA on her side, with her main-sail trailing wide\nupon the surface of the bay. About the same time, the sun went fairly\ndown and the breeze whistled low in the dusk among the tossing pines.\n\nAt least, and at last, I was off the sea, nor had I returned thence\nempty-handed. There lay the schooner, clear at last from buccaneers\nand ready for our own men to board and get to sea again. I had nothing\nnearer my fancy than to get home to the stockade and boast of my\nachievements. Possibly I might be blamed a bit for my truantry, but the\nrecapture of the HISPANIOLA was a clenching answer, and I hoped that\neven Captain Smollett would confess I had not lost my time.\n\nSo thinking, and in famous spirits, I began to set my face homeward for\nthe block house and my companions. I remembered that the most easterly\nof the rivers which drain into Captain Kidd's anchorage ran from the\ntwo-peaked hill upon my left, and I bent my course in that direction\nthat I might pass the stream while it was small. The wood was pretty\nopen, and keeping along the lower spurs, I had soon turned the corner\nof that hill, and not long after waded to the mid-calf across the\nwatercourse.\n\nThis brought me near to where I had encountered Ben Gunn, the maroon;\nand I walked more circumspectly, keeping an eye on every side. The dusk\nhad come nigh hand completely, and as I opened out the cleft between the\ntwo peaks, I became aware of a wavering glow against the sky, where, as\nI judged, the man of the island was cooking his supper before a roaring\nfire. And yet I wondered, in my heart, that he should show himself so\ncareless. For if I could see this radiance, might it not reach the eyes\nof Silver himself where he camped upon the shore among the marshes?\n\nGradually the night fell blacker; it was all I could do to guide myself\neven roughly towards my destination; the double hill behind me and the\nSpy-glass on my right hand loomed faint and fainter; the stars were few\nand pale; and in the low ground where I wandered I kept tripping among\nbushes and rolling into sandy pits.\n\nSuddenly a kind of brightness fell about me. I looked up; a pale glimmer\nof moonbeams had alighted on the summit of the Spy-glass, and soon after\nI saw something broad and silvery moving low down behind the trees, and\nknew the moon had risen.\n\nWith this to help me, I passed rapidly over what remained to me of my\njourney, and sometimes walking, sometimes running, impatiently drew near\nto the stockade. Yet, as I began to thread the grove that lies before\nit, I was not so thoughtless but that I slacked my pace and went a\ntrifle warily. It would have been a poor end of my adventures to get\nshot down by my own party in mistake.\n\nThe moon was climbing higher and higher, its light began to fall here\nand there in masses through the more open districts of the wood, and\nright in front of me a glow of a different colour appeared among\nthe trees. It was red and hot, and now and again it was a little\ndarkened--as it were, the embers of a bonfire smouldering.\n\nFor the life of me I could not think what it might be.\n\nAt last I came right down upon the borders of the clearing. The western\nend was already steeped in moonshine; the rest, and the block house\nitself, still lay in a black shadow chequered with long silvery streaks\nof light. On the other side of the house an immense fire had burned\nitself into clear embers and shed a steady, red reverberation,\ncontrasted strongly with the mellow paleness of the moon. There was not\na soul stirring nor a sound beside the noises of the breeze.\n\nI stopped, with much wonder in my heart, and perhaps a little terror\nalso. It had not been our way to build great fires; we were, indeed,\nby the captain's orders, somewhat niggardly of firewood, and I began to\nfear that something had gone wrong while I was absent.\n\nI stole round by the eastern end, keeping close in shadow, and at a\nconvenient place, where the darkness was thickest, crossed the palisade.\n\nTo make assurance surer, I got upon my hands and knees and crawled,\nwithout a sound, towards the corner of the house. As I drew nearer, my\nheart was suddenly and greatly lightened. It is not a pleasant noise in\nitself, and I have often complained of it at other times, but just\nthen it was like music to hear my friends snoring together so loud and\npeaceful in their sleep. The sea-cry of the watch, that beautiful “All's\nwell,” never fell more reassuringly on my ear.\n\nIn the meantime, there was no doubt of one thing; they kept an infamous\nbad watch. If it had been Silver and his lads that were now creeping\nin on them, not a soul would have seen daybreak. That was what it\nwas, thought I, to have the captain wounded; and again I blamed myself\nsharply for leaving them in that danger with so few to mount guard.\n\nBy this time I had got to the door and stood up. All was dark within,\nso that I could distinguish nothing by the eye. As for sounds, there\nwas the steady drone of the snorers and a small occasional noise, a\nflickering or pecking that I could in no way account for.\n\nWith my arms before me I walked steadily in. I should lie down in my own\nplace (I thought with a silent chuckle) and enjoy their faces when they\nfound me in the morning.\n\nMy foot struck something yielding--it was a sleeper's leg; and he turned\nand groaned, but without awaking.\n\nAnd then, all of a sudden, a shrill voice broke forth out of the\ndarkness:\n\n“Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!\nPieces of eight!” and so forth, without pause or change, like the\nclacking of a tiny mill.\n\nSilver's green parrot, Captain Flint! It was she whom I had heard\npecking at a piece of bark; it was she, keeping better watch than any\nhuman being, who thus announced my arrival with her wearisome refrain.\n\nI had no time left me to recover. At the sharp, clipping tone of the\nparrot, the sleepers awoke and sprang up; and with a mighty oath, the\nvoice of Silver cried, “Who goes?”\n\nI turned to run, struck violently against one person, recoiled, and ran\nfull into the arms of a second, who for his part closed upon and held me\ntight.\n\n“Bring a torch, Dick,” said Silver when my capture was thus assured.\n\nAnd one of the men left the log-house and presently returned with a\nlighted brand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPART SIX--Captain Silver\n\n\n\n\n28\n\nIn the Enemy's Camp\n\nTHE red glare of the torch, lighting up the interior of the block house,\nshowed me the worst of my apprehensions realized. The pirates were in\npossession of the house and stores: there was the cask of cognac,\nthere were the pork and bread, as before, and what tenfold increased\nmy horror, not a sign of any prisoner. I could only judge that all had\nperished, and my heart smote me sorely that I had not been there to\nperish with them.\n\nThere were six of the buccaneers, all told; not another man was left\nalive. Five of them were on their feet, flushed and swollen, suddenly\ncalled out of the first sleep of drunkenness. The sixth had only risen\nupon his elbow; he was deadly pale, and the blood-stained bandage round\nhis head told that he had recently been wounded, and still more recently\ndressed. I remembered the man who had been shot and had run back among\nthe woods in the great attack, and doubted not that this was he.\n\nThe parrot sat, preening her plumage, on Long John's shoulder. He\nhimself, I thought, looked somewhat paler and more stern than I was used\nto. He still wore the fine broadcloth suit in which he had fulfilled his\nmission, but it was bitterly the worse for wear, daubed with clay and\ntorn with the sharp briers of the wood.\n\n“So,” said he, “here's Jim Hawkins, shiver my timbers! Dropped in, like,\neh? Well, come, I take that friendly.”\n\nAnd thereupon he sat down across the brandy cask and began to fill a\npipe.\n\n“Give me a loan of the link, Dick,” said he; and then, when he had a\ngood light, “That'll do, lad,” he added; “stick the glim in the wood\nheap; and you, gentlemen, bring yourselves to! You needn't stand up\nfor Mr. Hawkins; HE'LL excuse you, you may lay to that. And so,\nJim”--stopping the tobacco--“here you were, and quite a pleasant\nsurprise for poor old John. I see you were smart when first I set my\neyes on you, but this here gets away from me clean, it do.”\n\nTo all this, as may be well supposed, I made no answer. They had set me\nwith my back against the wall, and I stood there, looking Silver in the\nface, pluckily enough, I hope, to all outward appearance, but with black\ndespair in my heart.\n\nSilver took a whiff or two of his pipe with great composure and then ran\non again.\n\n“Now, you see, Jim, so be as you ARE here,” says he, “I'll give you a\npiece of my mind. I've always liked you, I have, for a lad of spirit,\nand the picter of my own self when I was young and handsome. I always\nwanted you to jine and take your share, and die a gentleman, and now, my\ncock, you've got to. Cap'n Smollett's a fine seaman, as I'll own up to\nany day, but stiff on discipline. 'Dooty is dooty,' says he, and right\nhe is. Just you keep clear of the cap'n. The doctor himself is gone dead\nagain you--'ungrateful scamp' was what he said; and the short and the\nlong of the whole story is about here: you can't go back to your own\nlot, for they won't have you; and without you start a third ship's\ncompany all by yourself, which might be lonely, you'll have to jine with\nCap'n Silver.”\n\nSo far so good. My friends, then, were still alive, and though I partly\nbelieved the truth of Silver's statement, that the cabin party were\nincensed at me for my desertion, I was more relieved than distressed by\nwhat I heard.\n\n“I don't say nothing as to your being in our hands,” continued Silver,\n“though there you are, and you may lay to it. I'm all for argyment; I\nnever seen good come out o' threatening. If you like the service, well,\nyou'll jine; and if you don't, Jim, why, you're free to answer no--free\nand welcome, shipmate; and if fairer can be said by mortal seaman,\nshiver my sides!”\n\n“Am I to answer, then?” I asked with a very tremulous voice. Through all\nthis sneering talk, I was made to feel the threat of death that overhung\nme, and my cheeks burned and my heart beat painfully in my breast.\n\n“Lad,” said Silver, “no one's a-pressing of you. Take your bearings.\nNone of us won't hurry you, mate; time goes so pleasant in your company,\nyou see.”\n\n“Well,” says I, growing a bit bolder, “if I'm to choose, I declare I\nhave a right to know what's what, and why you're here, and where my\nfriends are.”\n\n“Wot's wot?” repeated one of the buccaneers in a deep growl. “Ah, he'd\nbe a lucky one as knowed that!”\n\n“You'll perhaps batten down your hatches till you're spoke to, my\nfriend,” cried Silver truculently to this speaker. And then, in\nhis first gracious tones, he replied to me, “Yesterday morning, Mr.\nHawkins,” said he, “in the dog-watch, down came Doctor Livesey with a\nflag of truce. Says he, 'Cap'n Silver, you're sold out. Ship's gone.'\nWell, maybe we'd been taking a glass, and a song to help it round. I\nwon't say no. Leastways, none of us had looked out. We looked out, and\nby thunder, the old ship was gone! I never seen a pack o' fools look\nfishier; and you may lay to that, if I tells you that looked the\nfishiest. 'Well,' says the doctor, 'let's bargain.' We bargained, him\nand I, and here we are: stores, brandy, block house, the firewood you\nwas thoughtful enough to cut, and in a manner of speaking, the whole\nblessed boat, from cross-trees to kelson. As for them, they've tramped;\nI don't know where's they are.”\n\nHe drew again quietly at his pipe.\n\n“And lest you should take it into that head of yours,” he went on, “that\nyou was included in the treaty, here's the last word that was said: 'How\nmany are you,' says I, 'to leave?' 'Four,' says he; 'four, and one of us\nwounded. As for that boy, I don't know where he is, confound him,' says\nhe, 'nor I don't much care. We're about sick of him.' These was his\nwords.\n\n“Is that all?” I asked.\n\n“Well, it's all that you're to hear, my son,” returned Silver.\n\n“And now I am to choose?”\n\n“And now you are to choose, and you may lay to that,” said Silver.\n\n“Well,” said I, “I am not such a fool but I know pretty well what I have\nto look for. Let the worst come to the worst, it's little I care. I've\nseen too many die since I fell in with you. But there's a thing or two\nI have to tell you,” I said, and by this time I was quite excited; “and\nthe first is this: here you are, in a bad way--ship lost, treasure lost,\nmen lost, your whole business gone to wreck; and if you want to know who\ndid it--it was I! I was in the apple barrel the night we sighted land,\nand I heard you, John, and you, Dick Johnson, and Hands, who is now at\nthe bottom of the sea, and told every word you said before the hour was\nout. And as for the schooner, it was I who cut her cable, and it was I\nthat killed the men you had aboard of her, and it was I who brought her\nwhere you'll never see her more, not one of you. The laugh's on my side;\nI've had the top of this business from the first; I no more fear you\nthan I fear a fly. Kill me, if you please, or spare me. But one thing\nI'll say, and no more; if you spare me, bygones are bygones, and when\nyou fellows are in court for piracy, I'll save you all I can. It is for\nyou to choose. Kill another and do yourselves no good, or spare me and\nkeep a witness to save you from the gallows.”\n\nI stopped, for, I tell you, I was out of breath, and to my wonder, not\na man of them moved, but all sat staring at me like as many sheep. And\nwhile they were still staring, I broke out again, “And now, Mr. Silver,”\n I said, “I believe you're the best man here, and if things go to the\nworst, I'll take it kind of you to let the doctor know the way I took\nit.”\n\n“I'll bear it in mind,” said Silver with an accent so curious that I\ncould not, for the life of me, decide whether he were laughing at my\nrequest or had been favourably affected by my courage.\n\n“I'll put one to that,” cried the old mahogany-faced seaman--Morgan\nby name--whom I had seen in Long John's public-house upon the quays of\nBristol. “It was him that knowed Black Dog.”\n\n“Well, and see here,” added the sea-cook. “I'll put another again to\nthat, by thunder! For it was this same boy that faked the chart from\nBilly Bones. First and last, we've split upon Jim Hawkins!”\n\n“Then here goes!” said Morgan with an oath.\n\nAnd he sprang up, drawing his knife as if he had been twenty.\n\n“Avast, there!” cried Silver. “Who are you, Tom Morgan? Maybe you\nthought you was cap'n here, perhaps. By the powers, but I'll teach you\nbetter! Cross me, and you'll go where many a good man's gone before you,\nfirst and last, these thirty year back--some to the yard-arm, shiver\nmy timbers, and some by the board, and all to feed the fishes. There's\nnever a man looked me between the eyes and seen a good day a'terwards,\nTom Morgan, you may lay to that.”\n\nMorgan paused, but a hoarse murmur rose from the others.\n\n“Tom's right,” said one.\n\n“I stood hazing long enough from one,” added another. “I'll be hanged if\nI'll be hazed by you, John Silver.”\n\n“Did any of you gentlemen want to have it out with ME?” roared Silver,\nbending far forward from his position on the keg, with his pipe still\nglowing in his right hand. “Put a name on what you're at; you ain't\ndumb, I reckon. Him that wants shall get it. Have I lived this many\nyears, and a son of a rum puncheon cock his hat athwart my hawse at the\nlatter end of it? You know the way; you're all gentlemen o' fortune, by\nyour account. Well, I'm ready. Take a cutlass, him that dares, and I'll\nsee the colour of his inside, crutch and all, before that pipe's empty.”\n\nNot a man stirred; not a man answered.\n\n“That's your sort, is it?” he added, returning his pipe to his mouth.\n“Well, you're a gay lot to look at, anyway. Not much worth to fight, you\nain't. P'r'aps you can understand King George's English. I'm cap'n here\nby 'lection. I'm cap'n here because I'm the best man by a long sea-mile.\nYou won't fight, as gentlemen o' fortune should; then, by thunder,\nyou'll obey, and you may lay to it! I like that boy, now; I never seen\na better boy than that. He's more a man than any pair of rats of you in\nthis here house, and what I say is this: let me see him that'll lay a\nhand on him--that's what I say, and you may lay to it.”\n\nThere was a long pause after this. I stood straight up against the wall,\nmy heart still going like a sledge-hammer, but with a ray of hope\nnow shining in my bosom. Silver leant back against the wall, his arms\ncrossed, his pipe in the corner of his mouth, as calm as though he had\nbeen in church; yet his eye kept wandering furtively, and he kept the\ntail of it on his unruly followers. They, on their part, drew gradually\ntogether towards the far end of the block house, and the low hiss of\ntheir whispering sounded in my ear continuously, like a stream. One\nafter another, they would look up, and the red light of the torch would\nfall for a second on their nervous faces; but it was not towards me, it\nwas towards Silver that they turned their eyes.\n\n“You seem to have a lot to say,” remarked Silver, spitting far into the\nair. “Pipe up and let me hear it, or lay to.”\n\n“Ax your pardon, sir,” returned one of the men; “you're pretty free with\nsome of the rules; maybe you'll kindly keep an eye upon the rest. This\ncrew's dissatisfied; this crew don't vally bullying a marlin-spike; this\ncrew has its rights like other crews, I'll make so free as that; and by\nyour own rules, I take it we can talk together. I ax your pardon, sir,\nacknowledging you for to be captaing at this present; but I claim my\nright, and steps outside for a council.”\n\nAnd with an elaborate sea-salute, this fellow, a long, ill-looking,\nyellow-eyed man of five and thirty, stepped coolly towards the door and\ndisappeared out of the house. One after another the rest followed his\nexample, each making a salute as he passed, each adding some apology.\n“According to rules,” said one. “Forecastle council,” said Morgan. And\nso with one remark or another all marched out and left Silver and me\nalone with the torch.\n\nThe sea-cook instantly removed his pipe.\n\n“Now, look you here, Jim Hawkins,” he said in a steady whisper that was\nno more than audible, “you're within half a plank of death, and what's\na long sight worse, of torture. They're going to throw me off. But, you\nmark, I stand by you through thick and thin. I didn't mean to; no, not\ntill you spoke up. I was about desperate to lose that much blunt, and\nbe hanged into the bargain. But I see you was the right sort. I says to\nmyself, you stand by Hawkins, John, and Hawkins'll stand by you. You're\nhis last card, and by the living thunder, John, he's yours! Back to\nback, says I. You save your witness, and he'll save your neck!”\n\nI began dimly to understand.\n\n“You mean all's lost?” I asked.\n\n“Aye, by gum, I do!” he answered. “Ship gone, neck gone--that's the\nsize of it. Once I looked into that bay, Jim Hawkins, and seen no\nschooner--well, I'm tough, but I gave out. As for that lot and their\ncouncil, mark me, they're outright fools and cowards. I'll save your\nlife--if so be as I can--from them. But, see here, Jim--tit for tat--you\nsave Long John from swinging.”\n\nI was bewildered; it seemed a thing so hopeless he was asking--he, the\nold buccaneer, the ringleader throughout.\n\n“What I can do, that I'll do,” I said.\n\n“It's a bargain!” cried Long John. “You speak up plucky, and by thunder,\nI've a chance!”\n\nHe hobbled to the torch, where it stood propped among the firewood, and\ntook a fresh light to his pipe.\n\n“Understand me, Jim,” he said, returning. “I've a head on my shoulders,\nI have. I'm on squire's side now. I know you've got that ship safe\nsomewheres. How you done it, I don't know, but safe it is. I guess Hands\nand O'Brien turned soft. I never much believed in neither of THEM. Now\nyou mark me. I ask no questions, nor I won't let others. I know when\na game's up, I do; and I know a lad that's staunch. Ah, you that's\nyoung--you and me might have done a power of good together!”\n\nHe drew some cognac from the cask into a tin cannikin.\n\n“Will you taste, messmate?” he asked; and when I had refused: “Well,\nI'll take a dram myself, Jim,” said he. “I need a caulker, for there's\ntrouble on hand. And talking o' trouble, why did that doctor give me the\nchart, Jim?”\n\nMy face expressed a wonder so unaffected that he saw the needlessness of\nfurther questions.\n\n“Ah, well, he did, though,” said he. “And there's something under that,\nno doubt--something, surely, under that, Jim--bad or good.”\n\nAnd he took another swallow of the brandy, shaking his great fair head\nlike a man who looks forward to the worst.\n\n\n\n\n29\n\nThe Black Spot Again\n\nTHE council of buccaneers had lasted some time, when one of them\nre-entered the house, and with a repetition of the same salute, which\nhad in my eyes an ironical air, begged for a moment's loan of the torch.\nSilver briefly agreed, and this emissary retired again, leaving us\ntogether in the dark.\n\n“There's a breeze coming, Jim,” said Silver, who had by this time\nadopted quite a friendly and familiar tone.\n\nI turned to the loophole nearest me and looked out. The embers of the\ngreat fire had so far burned themselves out and now glowed so low and\nduskily that I understood why these conspirators desired a torch. About\nhalf-way down the slope to the stockade, they were collected in a group;\none held the light, another was on his knees in their midst, and I saw\nthe blade of an open knife shine in his hand with varying colours in\nthe moon and torchlight. The rest were all somewhat stooping, as though\nwatching the manoeuvres of this last. I could just make out that he\nhad a book as well as a knife in his hand, and was still wondering how\nanything so incongruous had come in their possession when the kneeling\nfigure rose once more to his feet and the whole party began to move\ntogether towards the house.\n\n“Here they come,” said I; and I returned to my former position, for it\nseemed beneath my dignity that they should find me watching them.\n\n“Well, let 'em come, lad--let 'em come,” said Silver cheerily. “I've\nstill a shot in my locker.”\n\nThe door opened, and the five men, standing huddled together just\ninside, pushed one of their number forward. In any other circumstances\nit would have been comical to see his slow advance, hesitating as he set\ndown each foot, but holding his closed right hand in front of him.\n\n“Step up, lad,” cried Silver. “I won't eat you. Hand it over, lubber. I\nknow the rules, I do; I won't hurt a depytation.”\n\nThus encouraged, the buccaneer stepped forth more briskly, and having\npassed something to Silver, from hand to hand, slipped yet more smartly\nback again to his companions.\n\nThe sea-cook looked at what had been given him.\n\n“The black spot! I thought so,” he observed. “Where might you have got\nthe paper? Why, hillo! Look here, now; this ain't lucky! You've gone and\ncut this out of a Bible. What fool's cut a Bible?”\n\n“Ah, there!” said Morgan. “There! Wot did I say? No good'll come o'\nthat, I said.”\n\n“Well, you've about fixed it now, among you,” continued Silver. “You'll\nall swing now, I reckon. What soft-headed lubber had a Bible?”\n\n“It was Dick,” said one.\n\n“Dick, was it? Then Dick can get to prayers,” said Silver. “He's seen\nhis slice of luck, has Dick, and you may lay to that.”\n\nBut here the long man with the yellow eyes struck in.\n\n“Belay that talk, John Silver,” he said. “This crew has tipped you the\nblack spot in full council, as in dooty bound; just you turn it over, as\nin dooty bound, and see what's wrote there. Then you can talk.”\n\n“Thanky, George,” replied the sea-cook. “You always was brisk for\nbusiness, and has the rules by heart, George, as I'm pleased to see.\nWell, what is it, anyway? Ah! 'Deposed'--that's it, is it? Very pretty\nwrote, to be sure; like print, I swear. Your hand o' write, George? Why,\nyou was gettin' quite a leadin' man in this here crew. You'll be cap'n\nnext, I shouldn't wonder. Just oblige me with that torch again, will\nyou? This pipe don't draw.”\n\n“Come, now,” said George, “you don't fool this crew no more. You're a\nfunny man, by your account; but you're over now, and you'll maybe step\ndown off that barrel and help vote.”\n\n“I thought you said you knowed the rules,” returned Silver\ncontemptuously. “Leastways, if you don't, I do; and I wait here--and I'm\nstill your cap'n, mind--till you outs with your grievances and I reply;\nin the meantime, your black spot ain't worth a biscuit. After that,\nwe'll see.”\n\n“Oh,” replied George, “you don't be under no kind of apprehension; WE'RE\nall square, we are. First, you've made a hash of this cruise--you'll be\na bold man to say no to that. Second, you let the enemy out o' this here\ntrap for nothing. Why did they want out? I dunno, but it's pretty plain\nthey wanted it. Third, you wouldn't let us go at them upon the march.\nOh, we see through you, John Silver; you want to play booty, that's\nwhat's wrong with you. And then, fourth, there's this here boy.”\n\n“Is that all?” asked Silver quietly.\n\n“Enough, too,” retorted George. “We'll all swing and sun-dry for your\nbungling.”\n\n“Well now, look here, I'll answer these four p'ints; one after another\nI'll answer 'em. I made a hash o' this cruise, did I? Well now, you all\nknow what I wanted, and you all know if that had been done that we'd\n'a been aboard the HISPANIOLA this night as ever was, every man of us\nalive, and fit, and full of good plum-duff, and the treasure in the hold\nof her, by thunder! Well, who crossed me? Who forced my hand, as was the\nlawful cap'n? Who tipped me the black spot the day we landed and began\nthis dance? Ah, it's a fine dance--I'm with you there--and looks mighty\nlike a hornpipe in a rope's end at Execution Dock by London town, it\ndoes. But who done it? Why, it was Anderson, and Hands, and you, George\nMerry! And you're the last above board of that same meddling crew;\nand you have the Davy Jones's insolence to up and stand for cap'n over\nme--you, that sank the lot of us! By the powers! But this tops the\nstiffest yarn to nothing.”\n\nSilver paused, and I could see by the faces of George and his late\ncomrades that these words had not been said in vain.\n\n“That's for number one,” cried the accused, wiping the sweat from his\nbrow, for he had been talking with a vehemence that shook the house.\n“Why, I give you my word, I'm sick to speak to you. You've neither sense\nnor memory, and I leave it to fancy where your mothers was that let you\ncome to sea. Sea! Gentlemen o' fortune! I reckon tailors is your trade.”\n\n“Go on, John,” said Morgan. “Speak up to the others.”\n\n“Ah, the others!” returned John. “They're a nice lot, ain't they? You\nsay this cruise is bungled. Ah! By gum, if you could understand how bad\nit's bungled, you would see! We're that near the gibbet that my neck's\nstiff with thinking on it. You've seen 'em, maybe, hanged in chains,\nbirds about 'em, seamen p'inting 'em out as they go down with the tide.\n'Who's that?' says one. 'That! Why, that's John Silver. I knowed him\nwell,' says another. And you can hear the chains a-jangle as you go\nabout and reach for the other buoy. Now, that's about where we are,\nevery mother's son of us, thanks to him, and Hands, and Anderson, and\nother ruination fools of you. And if you want to know about number four,\nand that boy, why, shiver my timbers, isn't he a hostage? Are we a-going\nto waste a hostage? No, not us; he might be our last chance, and I\nshouldn't wonder. Kill that boy? Not me, mates! And number three? Ah,\nwell, there's a deal to say to number three. Maybe you don't count it\nnothing to have a real college doctor to see you every day--you, John,\nwith your head broke--or you, George Merry, that had the ague shakes\nupon you not six hours agone, and has your eyes the colour of lemon peel\nto this same moment on the clock? And maybe, perhaps, you didn't know\nthere was a consort coming either? But there is, and not so long till\nthen; and we'll see who'll be glad to have a hostage when it comes to\nthat. And as for number two, and why I made a bargain--well, you came\ncrawling on your knees to me to make it--on your knees you came, you was\nthat downhearted--and you'd have starved too if I hadn't--but that's a\ntrifle! You look there--that's why!”\n\nAnd he cast down upon the floor a paper that I instantly\nrecognized--none other than the chart on yellow paper, with the three\nred crosses, that I had found in the oilcloth at the bottom of the\ncaptain's chest. Why the doctor had given it to him was more than I\ncould fancy.\n\nBut if it were inexplicable to me, the appearance of the chart was\nincredible to the surviving mutineers. They leaped upon it like cats\nupon a mouse. It went from hand to hand, one tearing it from another;\nand by the oaths and the cries and the childish laughter with which they\naccompanied their examination, you would have thought, not only they\nwere fingering the very gold, but were at sea with it, besides, in\nsafety.\n\n“Yes,” said one, “that's Flint, sure enough. J. F., and a score below,\nwith a clove hitch to it; so he done ever.”\n\n“Mighty pretty,” said George. “But how are we to get away with it, and\nus no ship.”\n\nSilver suddenly sprang up, and supporting himself with a hand against\nthe wall: “Now I give you warning, George,” he cried. “One more word\nof your sauce, and I'll call you down and fight you. How? Why, how do I\nknow? You had ought to tell me that--you and the rest, that lost me my\nschooner, with your interference, burn you! But not you, you can't; you\nhain't got the invention of a cockroach. But civil you can speak, and\nshall, George Merry, you may lay to that.”\n\n“That's fair enow,” said the old man Morgan.\n\n“Fair! I reckon so,” said the sea-cook. “You lost the ship; I found the\ntreasure. Who's the better man at that? And now I resign, by thunder!\nElect whom you please to be your cap'n now; I'm done with it.”\n\n“Silver!” they cried. “Barbecue forever! Barbecue for cap'n!”\n\n“So that's the toon, is it?” cried the cook. “George, I reckon you'll\nhave to wait another turn, friend; and lucky for you as I'm not a\nrevengeful man. But that was never my way. And now, shipmates, this\nblack spot? 'Tain't much good now, is it? Dick's crossed his luck and\nspoiled his Bible, and that's about all.”\n\n“It'll do to kiss the book on still, won't it?” growled Dick, who was\nevidently uneasy at the curse he had brought upon himself.\n\n“A Bible with a bit cut out!” returned Silver derisively. “Not it. It\ndon't bind no more'n a ballad-book.”\n\n“Don't it, though?” cried Dick with a sort of joy. “Well, I reckon\nthat's worth having too.”\n\n“Here, Jim--here's a cur'osity for you,” said Silver, and he tossed me\nthe paper.\n\nIt was around about the size of a crown piece. One side was blank,\nfor it had been the last leaf; the other contained a verse or two of\nRevelation--these words among the rest, which struck sharply home upon\nmy mind: “Without are dogs and murderers.” The printed side had been\nblackened with wood ash, which already began to come off and soil my\nfingers; on the blank side had been written with the same material the\none word “Depposed.” I have that curiosity beside me at this moment, but\nnot a trace of writing now remains beyond a single scratch, such as a\nman might make with his thumb-nail.\n\nThat was the end of the night's business. Soon after, with a drink all\nround, we lay down to sleep, and the outside of Silver's vengeance was\nto put George Merry up for sentinel and threaten him with death if he\nshould prove unfaithful.\n\nIt was long ere I could close an eye, and heaven knows I had matter\nenough for thought in the man whom I had slain that afternoon, in my own\nmost perilous position, and above all, in the remarkable game that I saw\nSilver now engaged upon--keeping the mutineers together with one hand\nand grasping with the other after every means, possible and impossible,\nto make his peace and save his miserable life. He himself slept\npeacefully and snored aloud, yet my heart was sore for him, wicked as he\nwas, to think on the dark perils that environed and the shameful gibbet\nthat awaited him.\n\n\n\n\n30\n\nOn Parole\n\nI WAS wakened--indeed, we were all wakened, for I could see even the\nsentinel shake himself together from where he had fallen against the\ndoor-post--by a clear, hearty voice hailing us from the margin of the\nwood:\n\n“Block house, ahoy!” it cried. “Here's the doctor.”\n\nAnd the doctor it was. Although I was glad to hear the sound, yet my\ngladness was not without admixture. I remembered with confusion my\ninsubordinate and stealthy conduct, and when I saw where it had brought\nme--among what companions and surrounded by what dangers--I felt ashamed\nto look him in the face.\n\nHe must have risen in the dark, for the day had hardly come; and when I\nran to a loophole and looked out, I saw him standing, like Silver once\nbefore, up to the mid-leg in creeping vapour.\n\n“You, doctor! Top o' the morning to you, sir!” cried Silver, broad awake\nand beaming with good nature in a moment. “Bright and early, to be sure;\nand it's the early bird, as the saying goes, that gets the rations.\nGeorge, shake up your timbers, son, and help Dr. Livesey over the ship's\nside. All a-doin' well, your patients was--all well and merry.”\n\nSo he pattered on, standing on the hilltop with his crutch under his\nelbow and one hand upon the side of the log-house--quite the old John in\nvoice, manner, and expression.\n\n“We've quite a surprise for you too, sir,” he continued. “We've a little\nstranger here--he! he! A noo boarder and lodger, sir, and looking fit\nand taut as a fiddle; slep' like a supercargo, he did, right alongside\nof John--stem to stem we was, all night.”\n\nDr. Livesey was by this time across the stockade and pretty near the\ncook, and I could hear the alteration in his voice as he said, “Not\nJim?”\n\n“The very same Jim as ever was,” says Silver.\n\nThe doctor stopped outright, although he did not speak, and it was some\nseconds before he seemed able to move on.\n\n“Well, well,” he said at last, “duty first and pleasure afterwards, as\nyou might have said yourself, Silver. Let us overhaul these patients of\nyours.”\n\nA moment afterwards he had entered the block house and with one grim\nnod to me proceeded with his work among the sick. He seemed under no\napprehension, though he must have known that his life, among these\ntreacherous demons, depended on a hair; and he rattled on to his\npatients as if he were paying an ordinary professional visit in a quiet\nEnglish family. His manner, I suppose, reacted on the men, for they\nbehaved to him as if nothing had occurred, as if he were still ship's\ndoctor and they still faithful hands before the mast.\n\n“You're doing well, my friend,” he said to the fellow with the bandaged\nhead, “and if ever any person had a close shave, it was you; your head\nmust be as hard as iron. Well, George, how goes it? You're a pretty\ncolour, certainly; why, your liver, man, is upside down. Did you take\nthat medicine? Did he take that medicine, men?”\n\n“Aye, aye, sir, he took it, sure enough,” returned Morgan.\n\n“Because, you see, since I am mutineers' doctor, or prison doctor as I\nprefer to call it,” says Doctor Livesey in his pleasantest way, “I make\nit a point of honour not to lose a man for King George (God bless him!)\nand the gallows.”\n\nThe rogues looked at each other but swallowed the home-thrust in\nsilence.\n\n“Dick don't feel well, sir,” said one.\n\n“Don't he?” replied the doctor. “Well, step up here, Dick, and let me\nsee your tongue. No, I should be surprised if he did! The man's tongue\nis fit to frighten the French. Another fever.”\n\n“Ah, there,” said Morgan, “that comed of sp'iling Bibles.”\n\n“That comes--as you call it--of being arrant asses,” retorted the\ndoctor, “and not having sense enough to know honest air from poison,\nand the dry land from a vile, pestiferous slough. I think it most\nprobable--though of course it's only an opinion--that you'll all have\nthe deuce to pay before you get that malaria out of your systems. Camp\nin a bog, would you? Silver, I'm surprised at you. You're less of a fool\nthan many, take you all round; but you don't appear to me to have the\nrudiments of a notion of the rules of health.\n\n“Well,” he added after he had dosed them round and they had taken\nhis prescriptions, with really laughable humility, more like charity\nschoolchildren than blood-guilty mutineers and pirates--“well, that's\ndone for today. And now I should wish to have a talk with that boy,\nplease.”\n\nAnd he nodded his head in my direction carelessly.\n\nGeorge Merry was at the door, spitting and spluttering over some\nbad-tasted medicine; but at the first word of the doctor's proposal he\nswung round with a deep flush and cried “No!” and swore.\n\nSilver struck the barrel with his open hand.\n\n“Si-lence!” he roared and looked about him positively like a lion.\n“Doctor,” he went on in his usual tones, “I was a-thinking of that,\nknowing as how you had a fancy for the boy. We're all humbly grateful\nfor your kindness, and as you see, puts faith in you and takes the drugs\ndown like that much grog. And I take it I've found a way as'll suit all.\nHawkins, will you give me your word of honour as a young gentleman--for\na young gentleman you are, although poor born--your word of honour not\nto slip your cable?”\n\nI readily gave the pledge required.\n\n“Then, doctor,” said Silver, “you just step outside o' that stockade,\nand once you're there I'll bring the boy down on the inside, and I\nreckon you can yarn through the spars. Good day to you, sir, and all our\ndooties to the squire and Cap'n Smollett.”\n\nThe explosion of disapproval, which nothing but Silver's black looks had\nrestrained, broke out immediately the doctor had left the house. Silver\nwas roundly accused of playing double--of trying to make a separate\npeace for himself, of sacrificing the interests of his accomplices and\nvictims, and, in one word, of the identical, exact thing that he was\ndoing. It seemed to me so obvious, in this case, that I could not\nimagine how he was to turn their anger. But he was twice the man\nthe rest were, and his last night's victory had given him a huge\npreponderance on their minds. He called them all the fools and dolts\nyou can imagine, said it was necessary I should talk to the doctor,\nfluttered the chart in their faces, asked them if they could afford to\nbreak the treaty the very day they were bound a-treasure-hunting.\n\n“No, by thunder!” he cried. “It's us must break the treaty when the time\ncomes; and till then I'll gammon that doctor, if I have to ile his boots\nwith brandy.”\n\nAnd then he bade them get the fire lit, and stalked out upon his crutch,\nwith his hand on my shoulder, leaving them in a disarray, and silenced\nby his volubility rather than convinced.\n\n“Slow, lad, slow,” he said. “They might round upon us in a twinkle of an\neye if we was seen to hurry.”\n\nVery deliberately, then, did we advance across the sand to where the\ndoctor awaited us on the other side of the stockade, and as soon as we\nwere within easy speaking distance Silver stopped.\n\n“You'll make a note of this here also, doctor,” says he, “and the boy'll\ntell you how I saved his life, and were deposed for it too, and you\nmay lay to that. Doctor, when a man's steering as near the wind as\nme--playing chuck-farthing with the last breath in his body, like--you\nwouldn't think it too much, mayhap, to give him one good word? You'll\nplease bear in mind it's not my life only now--it's that boy's into the\nbargain; and you'll speak me fair, doctor, and give me a bit o' hope to\ngo on, for the sake of mercy.”\n\nSilver was a changed man once he was out there and had his back to his\nfriends and the block house; his cheeks seemed to have fallen in, his\nvoice trembled; never was a soul more dead in earnest.\n\n“Why, John, you're not afraid?” asked Dr. Livesey.\n\n“Doctor, I'm no coward; no, not I--not SO much!” and he snapped his\nfingers. “If I was I wouldn't say it. But I'll own up fairly, I've the\nshakes upon me for the gallows. You're a good man and a true; I never\nseen a better man! And you'll not forget what I done good, not any more\nthan you'll forget the bad, I know. And I step aside--see here--and\nleave you and Jim alone. And you'll put that down for me too, for it's a\nlong stretch, is that!”\n\nSo saying, he stepped back a little way, till he was out of earshot, and\nthere sat down upon a tree-stump and began to whistle, spinning round\nnow and again upon his seat so as to command a sight, sometimes of me\nand the doctor and sometimes of his unruly ruffians as they went to and\nfro in the sand between the fire--which they were busy rekindling--and\nthe house, from which they brought forth pork and bread to make the\nbreakfast.\n\n“So, Jim,” said the doctor sadly, “here you are. As you have brewed, so\nshall you drink, my boy. Heaven knows, I cannot find it in my heart to\nblame you, but this much I will say, be it kind or unkind: when Captain\nSmollett was well, you dared not have gone off; and when he was ill and\ncouldn't help it, by George, it was downright cowardly!”\n\nI will own that I here began to weep. “Doctor,” I said, “you might spare\nme. I have blamed myself enough; my life's forfeit anyway, and I should\nhave been dead by now if Silver hadn't stood for me; and doctor,\nbelieve this, I can die--and I dare say I deserve it--but what I fear is\ntorture. If they come to torture me--”\n\n“Jim,” the doctor interrupted, and his voice was quite changed, “Jim, I\ncan't have this. Whip over, and we'll run for it.”\n\n“Doctor,” said I, “I passed my word.”\n\n“I know, I know,” he cried. “We can't help that, Jim, now. I'll take it\non my shoulders, holus bolus, blame and shame, my boy; but stay here,\nI cannot let you. Jump! One jump, and you're out, and we'll run for it\nlike antelopes.”\n\n“No,” I replied; “you know right well you wouldn't do the thing\nyourself--neither you nor squire nor captain; and no more will I. Silver\ntrusted me; I passed my word, and back I go. But, doctor, you did not\nlet me finish. If they come to torture me, I might let slip a word of\nwhere the ship is, for I got the ship, part by luck and part by risking,\nand she lies in North Inlet, on the southern beach, and just below high\nwater. At half tide she must be high and dry.”\n\n“The ship!” exclaimed the doctor.\n\nRapidly I described to him my adventures, and he heard me out in\nsilence.\n\n“There is a kind of fate in this,” he observed when I had done. “Every\nstep, it's you that saves our lives; and do you suppose by any chance\nthat we are going to let you lose yours? That would be a poor return, my\nboy. You found out the plot; you found Ben Gunn--the best deed that\never you did, or will do, though you live to ninety. Oh, by Jupiter, and\ntalking of Ben Gunn! Why, this is the mischief in person. Silver!” he\ncried. “Silver! I'll give you a piece of advice,” he continued as\nthe cook drew near again; “don't you be in any great hurry after that\ntreasure.”\n\n“Why, sir, I do my possible, which that ain't,” said Silver. “I can\nonly, asking your pardon, save my life and the boy's by seeking for that\ntreasure; and you may lay to that.”\n\n“Well, Silver,” replied the doctor, “if that is so, I'll go one step\nfurther: look out for squalls when you find it.”\n\n“Sir,” said Silver, “as between man and man, that's too much and too\nlittle. What you're after, why you left the block house, why you given\nme that there chart, I don't know, now, do I? And yet I done your\nbidding with my eyes shut and never a word of hope! But no, this here's\ntoo much. If you won't tell me what you mean plain out, just say so and\nI'll leave the helm.”\n\n“No,” said the doctor musingly; “I've no right to say more; it's not my\nsecret, you see, Silver, or, I give you my word, I'd tell it you. But\nI'll go as far with you as I dare go, and a step beyond, for I'll have\nmy wig sorted by the captain or I'm mistaken! And first, I'll give you a\nbit of hope; Silver, if we both get alive out of this wolf-trap, I'll do\nmy best to save you, short of perjury.”\n\nSilver's face was radiant. “You couldn't say more, I'm sure, sir, not if\nyou was my mother,” he cried.\n\n“Well, that's my first concession,” added the doctor. “My second is a\npiece of advice: keep the boy close beside you, and when you need help,\nhalloo. I'm off to seek it for you, and that itself will show you if I\nspeak at random. Good-bye, Jim.”\n\nAnd Dr. Livesey shook hands with me through the stockade, nodded to\nSilver, and set off at a brisk pace into the wood.\n\n\n\n\n31\n\nThe Treasure-hunt--Flint's Pointer\n\n“JIM,” said Silver when we were alone, “if I saved your life, you saved\nmine; and I'll not forget it. I seen the doctor waving you to run for\nit--with the tail of my eye, I did; and I seen you say no, as plain as\nhearing. Jim, that's one to you. This is the first glint of hope I had\nsince the attack failed, and I owe it you. And now, Jim, we're to go in\nfor this here treasure-hunting, with sealed orders too, and I don't like\nit; and you and me must stick close, back to back like, and we'll save\nour necks in spite o' fate and fortune.”\n\nJust then a man hailed us from the fire that breakfast was ready, and\nwe were soon seated here and there about the sand over biscuit and fried\njunk. They had lit a fire fit to roast an ox, and it was now grown so\nhot that they could only approach it from the windward, and even there\nnot without precaution. In the same wasteful spirit, they had cooked,\nI suppose, three times more than we could eat; and one of them, with an\nempty laugh, threw what was left into the fire, which blazed and roared\nagain over this unusual fuel. I never in my life saw men so careless of\nthe morrow; hand to mouth is the only word that can describe their way\nof doing; and what with wasted food and sleeping sentries, though they\nwere bold enough for a brush and be done with it, I could see their\nentire unfitness for anything like a prolonged campaign.\n\nEven Silver, eating away, with Captain Flint upon his shoulder, had not\na word of blame for their recklessness. And this the more surprised me,\nfor I thought he had never shown himself so cunning as he did then.\n\n“Aye, mates,” said he, “it's lucky you have Barbecue to think for you\nwith this here head. I got what I wanted, I did. Sure enough, they have\nthe ship. Where they have it, I don't know yet; but once we hit the\ntreasure, we'll have to jump about and find out. And then, mates, us\nthat has the boats, I reckon, has the upper hand.”\n\nThus he kept running on, with his mouth full of the hot bacon; thus he\nrestored their hope and confidence, and, I more than suspect, repaired\nhis own at the same time.\n\n“As for hostage,” he continued, “that's his last talk, I guess, with\nthem he loves so dear. I've got my piece o' news, and thanky to him\nfor that; but it's over and done. I'll take him in a line when we go\ntreasure-hunting, for we'll keep him like so much gold, in case of\naccidents, you mark, and in the meantime. Once we got the ship and\ntreasure both and off to sea like jolly companions, why then we'll talk\nMr. Hawkins over, we will, and we'll give him his share, to be sure, for\nall his kindness.”\n\nIt was no wonder the men were in a good humour now. For my part, I\nwas horribly cast down. Should the scheme he had now sketched prove\nfeasible, Silver, already doubly a traitor, would not hesitate to adopt\nit. He had still a foot in either camp, and there was no doubt he\nwould prefer wealth and freedom with the pirates to a bare escape from\nhanging, which was the best he had to hope on our side.\n\nNay, and even if things so fell out that he was forced to keep his faith\nwith Dr. Livesey, even then what danger lay before us! What a moment\nthat would be when the suspicions of his followers turned to certainty\nand he and I should have to fight for dear life--he a cripple and I a\nboy--against five strong and active seamen!\n\nAdd to this double apprehension the mystery that still hung over the\nbehaviour of my friends, their unexplained desertion of the stockade,\ntheir inexplicable cession of the chart, or harder still to understand,\nthe doctor's last warning to Silver, “Look out for squalls when you\nfind it,” and you will readily believe how little taste I found in my\nbreakfast and with how uneasy a heart I set forth behind my captors on\nthe quest for treasure.\n\nWe made a curious figure, had anyone been there to see us--all in soiled\nsailor clothes and all but me armed to the teeth. Silver had two guns\nslung about him--one before and one behind--besides the great cutlass\nat his waist and a pistol in each pocket of his square-tailed coat.\nTo complete his strange appearance, Captain Flint sat perched upon his\nshoulder and gabbling odds and ends of purposeless sea-talk. I had a\nline about my waist and followed obediently after the sea-cook, who\nheld the loose end of the rope, now in his free hand, now between his\npowerful teeth. For all the world, I was led like a dancing bear.\n\nThe other men were variously burthened, some carrying picks and\nshovels--for that had been the very first necessary they brought ashore\nfrom the HISPANIOLA--others laden with pork, bread, and brandy for the\nmidday meal. All the stores, I observed, came from our stock, and I\ncould see the truth of Silver's words the night before. Had he not\nstruck a bargain with the doctor, he and his mutineers, deserted by the\nship, must have been driven to subsist on clear water and the proceeds\nof their hunting. Water would have been little to their taste; a sailor\nis not usually a good shot; and besides all that, when they were so\nshort of eatables, it was not likely they would be very flush of powder.\n\nWell, thus equipped, we all set out--even the fellow with the broken\nhead, who should certainly have kept in shadow--and straggled, one after\nanother, to the beach, where the two gigs awaited us. Even these bore\ntrace of the drunken folly of the pirates, one in a broken thwart, and\nboth in their muddy and unbailed condition. Both were to be carried\nalong with us for the sake of safety; and so, with our numbers divided\nbetween them, we set forth upon the bosom of the anchorage.\n\nAs we pulled over, there was some discussion on the chart. The red cross\nwas, of course, far too large to be a guide; and the terms of the note\non the back, as you will hear, admitted of some ambiguity. They ran, the\nreader may remember, thus:\n\n     Tall tree, Spy-glass shoulder, bearing a point to\n     the N. of N.N.E.\n     Skeleton Island E.S.E. and by E.\n     Ten feet.\n\nA tall tree was thus the principal mark. Now, right before us the\nanchorage was bounded by a plateau from two to three hundred feet high,\nadjoining on the north the sloping southern shoulder of the Spy-glass\nand rising again towards the south into the rough, cliffy eminence\ncalled the Mizzen-mast Hill. The top of the plateau was dotted thickly\nwith pine-trees of varying height. Every here and there, one of a\ndifferent species rose forty or fifty feet clear above its neighbours,\nand which of these was the particular “tall tree” of Captain Flint could\nonly be decided on the spot, and by the readings of the compass.\n\nYet, although that was the case, every man on board the boats had\npicked a favourite of his own ere we were half-way over, Long John alone\nshrugging his shoulders and bidding them wait till they were there.\n\nWe pulled easily, by Silver's directions, not to weary the hands\nprematurely, and after quite a long passage, landed at the mouth of\nthe second river--that which runs down a woody cleft of the Spy-glass.\nThence, bending to our left, we began to ascend the slope towards the\nplateau.\n\nAt the first outset, heavy, miry ground and a matted, marish vegetation\ngreatly delayed our progress; but by little and little the hill began\nto steepen and become stony under foot, and the wood to change its\ncharacter and to grow in a more open order. It was, indeed, a most\npleasant portion of the island that we were now approaching. A\nheavy-scented broom and many flowering shrubs had almost taken the place\nof grass. Thickets of green nutmeg-trees were dotted here and there with\nthe red columns and the broad shadow of the pines; and the first mingled\ntheir spice with the aroma of the others. The air, besides, was fresh\nand stirring, and this, under the sheer sunbeams, was a wonderful\nrefreshment to our senses.\n\nThe party spread itself abroad, in a fan shape, shouting and leaping to\nand fro. About the centre, and a good way behind the rest, Silver and\nI followed--I tethered by my rope, he ploughing, with deep pants, among\nthe sliding gravel. From time to time, indeed, I had to lend him a hand,\nor he must have missed his footing and fallen backward down the hill.\n\nWe had thus proceeded for about half a mile and were approaching the\nbrow of the plateau when the man upon the farthest left began to cry\naloud, as if in terror. Shout after shout came from him, and the others\nbegan to run in his direction.\n\n“He can't 'a found the treasure,” said old Morgan, hurrying past us from\nthe right, “for that's clean a-top.”\n\nIndeed, as we found when we also reached the spot, it was something\nvery different. At the foot of a pretty big pine and involved in a green\ncreeper, which had even partly lifted some of the smaller bones, a human\nskeleton lay, with a few shreds of clothing, on the ground. I believe a\nchill struck for a moment to every heart.\n\n“He was a seaman,” said George Merry, who, bolder than the rest, had\ngone up close and was examining the rags of clothing. “Leastways, this\nis good sea-cloth.”\n\n“Aye, aye,” said Silver; “like enough; you wouldn't look to find a\nbishop here, I reckon. But what sort of a way is that for bones to lie?\n'Tain't in natur'.”\n\nIndeed, on a second glance, it seemed impossible to fancy that the body\nwas in a natural position. But for some disarray (the work, perhaps, of\nthe birds that had fed upon him or of the slow-growing creeper that had\ngradually enveloped his remains) the man lay perfectly straight--his\nfeet pointing in one direction, his hands, raised above his head like a\ndiver's, pointing directly in the opposite.\n\n“I've taken a notion into my old numbskull,” observed Silver. “Here's\nthe compass; there's the tip-top p'int o' Skeleton Island, stickin'\nout like a tooth. Just take a bearing, will you, along the line of them\nbones.”\n\nIt was done. The body pointed straight in the direction of the island,\nand the compass read duly E.S.E. and by E.\n\n“I thought so,” cried the cook; “this here is a p'inter. Right up there\nis our line for the Pole Star and the jolly dollars. But, by thunder!\nIf it don't make me cold inside to think of Flint. This is one of HIS\njokes, and no mistake. Him and these six was alone here; he killed 'em,\nevery man; and this one he hauled here and laid down by compass, shiver\nmy timbers! They're long bones, and the hair's been yellow. Aye, that\nwould be Allardyce. You mind Allardyce, Tom Morgan?”\n\n“Aye, aye,” returned Morgan; “I mind him; he owed me money, he did, and\ntook my knife ashore with him.”\n\n“Speaking of knives,” said another, “why don't we find his'n lying\nround? Flint warn't the man to pick a seaman's pocket; and the birds, I\nguess, would leave it be.”\n\n“By the powers, and that's true!” cried Silver.\n\n“There ain't a thing left here,” said Merry, still feeling round among\nthe bones; “not a copper doit nor a baccy box. It don't look nat'ral to\nme.”\n\n“No, by gum, it don't,” agreed Silver; “not nat'ral, nor not nice, says\nyou. Great guns! Messmates, but if Flint was living, this would be a hot\nspot for you and me. Six they were, and six are we; and bones is what\nthey are now.”\n\n“I saw him dead with these here deadlights,” said Morgan. “Billy took me\nin. There he laid, with penny-pieces on his eyes.”\n\n“Dead--aye, sure enough he's dead and gone below,” said the fellow with\nthe bandage; “but if ever sperrit walked, it would be Flint's. Dear\nheart, but he died bad, did Flint!”\n\n“Aye, that he did,” observed another; “now he raged, and now he hollered\nfor the rum, and now he sang. 'Fifteen Men' were his only song, mates;\nand I tell you true, I never rightly liked to hear it since. It was\nmain hot, and the windy was open, and I hear that old song comin' out as\nclear as clear--and the death-haul on the man already.”\n\n“Come, come,” said Silver; “stow this talk. He's dead, and he don't\nwalk, that I know; leastways, he won't walk by day, and you may lay to\nthat. Care killed a cat. Fetch ahead for the doubloons.”\n\nWe started, certainly; but in spite of the hot sun and the staring\ndaylight, the pirates no longer ran separate and shouting through the\nwood, but kept side by side and spoke with bated breath. The terror of\nthe dead buccaneer had fallen on their spirits.\n\n\n\n\n32\n\nThe Treasure-hunt--The Voice Among the Trees\n\nPARTLY from the damping influence of this alarm, partly to rest Silver\nand the sick folk, the whole party sat down as soon as they had gained\nthe brow of the ascent.\n\nThe plateau being somewhat tilted towards the west, this spot on which\nwe had paused commanded a wide prospect on either hand. Before us,\nover the tree-tops, we beheld the Cape of the Woods fringed with surf;\nbehind, we not only looked down upon the anchorage and Skeleton Island,\nbut saw--clear across the spit and the eastern lowlands--a great field\nof open sea upon the east. Sheer above us rose the Spyglass, here dotted\nwith single pines, there black with precipices. There was no sound but\nthat of the distant breakers, mounting from all round, and the chirp of\ncountless insects in the brush. Not a man, not a sail, upon the sea; the\nvery largeness of the view increased the sense of solitude.\n\nSilver, as he sat, took certain bearings with his compass.\n\n“There are three 'tall trees'” said he, “about in the right line from\nSkeleton Island. 'Spy-glass shoulder,' I take it, means that lower p'int\nthere. It's child's play to find the stuff now. I've half a mind to dine\nfirst.”\n\n“I don't feel sharp,” growled Morgan. “Thinkin' o' Flint--I think it\nwere--as done me.”\n\n“Ah, well, my son, you praise your stars he's dead,” said Silver.\n\n“He were an ugly devil,” cried a third pirate with a shudder; “that blue\nin the face too!”\n\n“That was how the rum took him,” added Merry. “Blue! Well, I reckon he\nwas blue. That's a true word.”\n\nEver since they had found the skeleton and got upon this train of\nthought, they had spoken lower and lower, and they had almost got to\nwhispering by now, so that the sound of their talk hardly interrupted\nthe silence of the wood. All of a sudden, out of the middle of the trees\nin front of us, a thin, high, trembling voice struck up the well-known\nair and words:\n\n     “Fifteen men on the dead man's chest--\n     Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!”\n\nI never have seen men more dreadfully affected than the pirates. The\ncolour went from their six faces like enchantment; some leaped to their\nfeet, some clawed hold of others; Morgan grovelled on the ground.\n\n“It's Flint, by ----!” cried Merry.\n\nThe song had stopped as suddenly as it began--broken off, you would have\nsaid, in the middle of a note, as though someone had laid his hand upon\nthe singer's mouth. Coming through the clear, sunny atmosphere among the\ngreen tree-tops, I thought it had sounded airily and sweetly; and the\neffect on my companions was the stranger.\n\n“Come,” said Silver, struggling with his ashen lips to get the word out;\n“this won't do. Stand by to go about. This is a rum start, and I can't\nname the voice, but it's someone skylarking--someone that's flesh and\nblood, and you may lay to that.”\n\nHis courage had come back as he spoke, and some of the colour to his\nface along with it. Already the others had begun to lend an ear to this\nencouragement and were coming a little to themselves, when the same\nvoice broke out again--not this time singing, but in a faint distant\nhail that echoed yet fainter among the clefts of the Spy-glass.\n\n“Darby M'Graw,” it wailed--for that is the word that best describes the\nsound--“Darby M'Graw! Darby M'Graw!” again and again and again; and then\nrising a little higher, and with an oath that I leave out: “Fetch aft\nthe rum, Darby!”\n\nThe buccaneers remained rooted to the ground, their eyes starting from\ntheir heads. Long after the voice had died away they still stared in\nsilence, dreadfully, before them.\n\n“That fixes it!” gasped one. “Let's go.”\n\n“They was his last words,” moaned Morgan, “his last words above board.”\n\nDick had his Bible out and was praying volubly. He had been well brought\nup, had Dick, before he came to sea and fell among bad companions.\n\nStill Silver was unconquered. I could hear his teeth rattle in his head,\nbut he had not yet surrendered.\n\n“Nobody in this here island ever heard of Darby,” he muttered; “not one\nbut us that's here.” And then, making a great effort: “Shipmates,”\n he cried, “I'm here to get that stuff, and I'll not be beat by man or\ndevil. I never was feared of Flint in his life, and, by the powers, I'll\nface him dead. There's seven hundred thousand pound not a quarter of a\nmile from here. When did ever a gentleman o' fortune show his stern to\nthat much dollars for a boozy old seaman with a blue mug--and him dead\ntoo?”\n\nBut there was no sign of reawakening courage in his followers, rather,\nindeed, of growing terror at the irreverence of his words.\n\n“Belay there, John!” said Merry. “Don't you cross a sperrit.”\n\nAnd the rest were all too terrified to reply. They would have run away\nseverally had they dared; but fear kept them together, and kept them\nclose by John, as if his daring helped them. He, on his part, had pretty\nwell fought his weakness down.\n\n“Sperrit? Well, maybe,” he said. “But there's one thing not clear to me.\nThere was an echo. Now, no man ever seen a sperrit with a shadow; well\nthen, what's he doing with an echo to him, I should like to know? That\nain't in natur', surely?”\n\nThis argument seemed weak enough to me. But you can never tell what will\naffect the superstitious, and to my wonder, George Merry was greatly\nrelieved.\n\n“Well, that's so,” he said. “You've a head upon your shoulders, John,\nand no mistake. 'Bout ship, mates! This here crew is on a wrong tack, I\ndo believe. And come to think on it, it was like Flint's voice, I\ngrant you, but not just so clear-away like it, after all. It was liker\nsomebody else's voice now--it was liker--”\n\n“By the powers, Ben Gunn!” roared Silver.\n\n“Aye, and so it were,” cried Morgan, springing on his knees. “Ben Gunn\nit were!”\n\n“It don't make much odds, do it, now?” asked Dick. “Ben Gunn's not here\nin the body any more'n Flint.”\n\nBut the older hands greeted this remark with scorn.\n\n“Why, nobody minds Ben Gunn,” cried Merry; “dead or alive, nobody minds\nhim.”\n\nIt was extraordinary how their spirits had returned and how the natural\ncolour had revived in their faces. Soon they were chatting together,\nwith intervals of listening; and not long after, hearing no further\nsound, they shouldered the tools and set forth again, Merry walking\nfirst with Silver's compass to keep them on the right line with Skeleton\nIsland. He had said the truth: dead or alive, nobody minded Ben Gunn.\n\nDick alone still held his Bible, and looked around him as he went, with\nfearful glances; but he found no sympathy, and Silver even joked him on\nhis precautions.\n\n“I told you,” said he--“I told you you had sp'iled your Bible. If it\nain't no good to swear by, what do you suppose a sperrit would give for\nit? Not that!” and he snapped his big fingers, halting a moment on his\ncrutch.\n\nBut Dick was not to be comforted; indeed, it was soon plain to me that\nthe lad was falling sick; hastened by heat, exhaustion, and the shock\nof his alarm, the fever, predicted by Dr. Livesey, was evidently growing\nswiftly higher.\n\nIt was fine open walking here, upon the summit; our way lay a little\ndownhill, for, as I have said, the plateau tilted towards the west. The\npines, great and small, grew wide apart; and even between the clumps of\nnutmeg and azalea, wide open spaces baked in the hot sunshine. Striking,\nas we did, pretty near north-west across the island, we drew, on the\none hand, ever nearer under the shoulders of the Spy-glass, and on the\nother, looked ever wider over that western bay where I had once tossed\nand trembled in the coracle.\n\nThe first of the tall trees was reached, and by the bearings proved the\nwrong one. So with the second. The third rose nearly two hundred feet\ninto the air above a clump of underwood--a giant of a vegetable, with\na red column as big as a cottage, and a wide shadow around in which a\ncompany could have manoeuvred. It was conspicuous far to sea both on\nthe east and west and might have been entered as a sailing mark upon the\nchart.\n\nBut it was not its size that now impressed my companions; it was the\nknowledge that seven hundred thousand pounds in gold lay somewhere\nburied below its spreading shadow. The thought of the money, as they\ndrew nearer, swallowed up their previous terrors. Their eyes burned in\ntheir heads; their feet grew speedier and lighter; their whole soul\nwas bound up in that fortune, that whole lifetime of extravagance and\npleasure, that lay waiting there for each of them.\n\nSilver hobbled, grunting, on his crutch; his nostrils stood out and\nquivered; he cursed like a madman when the flies settled on his hot and\nshiny countenance; he plucked furiously at the line that held me to\nhim and from time to time turned his eyes upon me with a deadly look.\nCertainly he took no pains to hide his thoughts, and certainly I read\nthem like print. In the immediate nearness of the gold, all else had\nbeen forgotten: his promise and the doctor's warning were both things\nof the past, and I could not doubt that he hoped to seize upon the\ntreasure, find and board the HISPANIOLA under cover of night, cut\nevery honest throat about that island, and sail away as he had at first\nintended, laden with crimes and riches.\n\nShaken as I was with these alarms, it was hard for me to keep up with\nthe rapid pace of the treasure-hunters. Now and again I stumbled, and it\nwas then that Silver plucked so roughly at the rope and launched at me\nhis murderous glances. Dick, who had dropped behind us and now brought\nup the rear, was babbling to himself both prayers and curses as his\nfever kept rising. This also added to my wretchedness, and to crown all,\nI was haunted by the thought of the tragedy that had once been acted\non that plateau, when that ungodly buccaneer with the blue face--he who\ndied at Savannah, singing and shouting for drink--had there, with his\nown hand, cut down his six accomplices. This grove that was now so\npeaceful must then have rung with cries, I thought; and even with the\nthought I could believe I heard it ringing still.\n\nWe were now at the margin of the thicket.\n\n“Huzza, mates, all together!” shouted Merry; and the foremost broke into\na run.\n\nAnd suddenly, not ten yards further, we beheld them stop. A low cry\narose. Silver doubled his pace, digging away with the foot of his crutch\nlike one possessed; and next moment he and I had come also to a dead\nhalt.\n\nBefore us was a great excavation, not very recent, for the sides had\nfallen in and grass had sprouted on the bottom. In this were the shaft\nof a pick broken in two and the boards of several packing-cases strewn\naround. On one of these boards I saw, branded with a hot iron, the name\nWALRUS--the name of Flint's ship.\n\nAll was clear to probation. The CACHE had been found and rifled; the\nseven hundred thousand pounds were gone!\n\n\n\n\n33\n\nThe Fall of a Chieftain\n\nTHERE never was such an overturn in this world. Each of these six men\nwas as though he had been struck. But with Silver the blow passed almost\ninstantly. Every thought of his soul had been set full-stretch, like a\nracer, on that money; well, he was brought up, in a single second, dead;\nand he kept his head, found his temper, and changed his plan before the\nothers had had time to realize the disappointment.\n\n“Jim,” he whispered, “take that, and stand by for trouble.”\n\nAnd he passed me a double-barrelled pistol.\n\nAt the same time, he began quietly moving northward, and in a few steps\nhad put the hollow between us two and the other five. Then he looked at\nme and nodded, as much as to say, “Here is a narrow corner,” as, indeed,\nI thought it was. His looks were not quite friendly, and I was so\nrevolted at these constant changes that I could not forbear whispering,\n“So you've changed sides again.”\n\nThere was no time left for him to answer in. The buccaneers, with oaths\nand cries, began to leap, one after another, into the pit and to dig\nwith their fingers, throwing the boards aside as they did so. Morgan\nfound a piece of gold. He held it up with a perfect spout of oaths. It\nwas a two-guinea piece, and it went from hand to hand among them for a\nquarter of a minute.\n\n“Two guineas!” roared Merry, shaking it at Silver. “That's your seven\nhundred thousand pounds, is it? You're the man for bargains, ain't you?\nYou're him that never bungled nothing, you wooden-headed lubber!”\n\n“Dig away, boys,” said Silver with the coolest insolence; “you'll find\nsome pig-nuts and I shouldn't wonder.”\n\n“Pig-nuts!” repeated Merry, in a scream. “Mates, do you hear that? I\ntell you now, that man there knew it all along. Look in the face of him\nand you'll see it wrote there.”\n\n“Ah, Merry,” remarked Silver, “standing for cap'n again? You're a\npushing lad, to be sure.”\n\nBut this time everyone was entirely in Merry's favour. They began to\nscramble out of the excavation, darting furious glances behind them. One\nthing I observed, which looked well for us: they all got out upon the\nopposite side from Silver.\n\nWell, there we stood, two on one side, five on the other, the pit\nbetween us, and nobody screwed up high enough to offer the first blow.\nSilver never moved; he watched them, very upright on his crutch, and\nlooked as cool as ever I saw him. He was brave, and no mistake.\n\nAt last Merry seemed to think a speech might help matters.\n\n“Mates,” says he, “there's two of them alone there; one's the old\ncripple that brought us all here and blundered us down to this; the\nother's that cub that I mean to have the heart of. Now, mates--”\n\nHe was raising his arm and his voice, and plainly meant to lead a\ncharge. But just then--crack! crack! crack!--three musket-shots flashed\nout of the thicket. Merry tumbled head foremost into the excavation; the\nman with the bandage spun round like a teetotum and fell all his length\nupon his side, where he lay dead, but still twitching; and the other\nthree turned and ran for it with all their might.\n\nBefore you could wink, Long John had fired two barrels of a pistol into\nthe struggling Merry, and as the man rolled up his eyes at him in the\nlast agony, “George,” said he, “I reckon I settled you.”\n\nAt the same moment, the doctor, Gray, and Ben Gunn joined us, with\nsmoking muskets, from among the nutmeg-trees.\n\n“Forward!” cried the doctor. “Double quick, my lads. We must head 'em\noff the boats.”\n\nAnd we set off at a great pace, sometimes plunging through the bushes to\nthe chest.\n\nI tell you, but Silver was anxious to keep up with us. The work that man\nwent through, leaping on his crutch till the muscles of his chest were\nfit to burst, was work no sound man ever equalled; and so thinks the\ndoctor. As it was, he was already thirty yards behind us and on the\nverge of strangling when we reached the brow of the slope.\n\n“Doctor,” he hailed, “see there! No hurry!”\n\nSure enough there was no hurry. In a more open part of the plateau, we\ncould see the three survivors still running in the same direction as\nthey had started, right for Mizzenmast Hill. We were already between\nthem and the boats; and so we four sat down to breathe, while Long John,\nmopping his face, came slowly up with us.\n\n“Thank ye kindly, doctor,” says he. “You came in in about the nick, I\nguess, for me and Hawkins. And so it's you, Ben Gunn!” he added. “Well,\nyou're a nice one, to be sure.”\n\n“I'm Ben Gunn, I am,” replied the maroon, wriggling like an eel in his\nembarrassment. “And,” he added, after a long pause, “how do, Mr. Silver?\nPretty well, I thank ye, says you.”\n\n“Ben, Ben,” murmured Silver, “to think as you've done me!”\n\nThe doctor sent back Gray for one of the pick-axes deserted, in their\nflight, by the mutineers, and then as we proceeded leisurely downhill to\nwhere the boats were lying, related in a few words what had taken place.\nIt was a story that profoundly interested Silver; and Ben Gunn, the\nhalf-idiot maroon, was the hero from beginning to end.\n\nBen, in his long, lonely wanderings about the island, had found the\nskeleton--it was he that had rifled it; he had found the treasure; he\nhad dug it up (it was the haft of his pick-axe that lay broken in the\nexcavation); he had carried it on his back, in many weary journeys, from\nthe foot of the tall pine to a cave he had on the two-pointed hill at\nthe north-east angle of the island, and there it had lain stored in\nsafety since two months before the arrival of the HISPANIOLA.\n\nWhen the doctor had wormed this secret from him on the afternoon of the\nattack, and when next morning he saw the anchorage deserted, he had gone\nto Silver, given him the chart, which was now useless--given him the\nstores, for Ben Gunn's cave was well supplied with goats' meat salted\nby himself--given anything and everything to get a chance of moving in\nsafety from the stockade to the two-pointed hill, there to be clear of\nmalaria and keep a guard upon the money.\n\n“As for you, Jim,” he said, “it went against my heart, but I did what I\nthought best for those who had stood by their duty; and if you were not\none of these, whose fault was it?”\n\nThat morning, finding that I was to be involved in the horrid\ndisappointment he had prepared for the mutineers, he had run all the way\nto the cave, and leaving the squire to guard the captain, had taken Gray\nand the maroon and started, making the diagonal across the island to be\nat hand beside the pine. Soon, however, he saw that our party had the\nstart of him; and Ben Gunn, being fleet of foot, had been dispatched in\nfront to do his best alone. Then it had occurred to him to work upon the\nsuperstitions of his former shipmates, and he was so far successful that\nGray and the doctor had come up and were already ambushed before the\narrival of the treasure-hunters.\n\n“Ah,” said Silver, “it were fortunate for me that I had Hawkins here.\nYou would have let old John be cut to bits, and never given it a\nthought, doctor.”\n\n“Not a thought,” replied Dr. Livesey cheerily.\n\nAnd by this time we had reached the gigs. The doctor, with the pick-axe,\ndemolished one of them, and then we all got aboard the other and set out\nto go round by sea for North Inlet.\n\nThis was a run of eight or nine miles. Silver, though he was almost\nkilled already with fatigue, was set to an oar, like the rest of us, and\nwe were soon skimming swiftly over a smooth sea. Soon we passed out\nof the straits and doubled the south-east corner of the island, round\nwhich, four days ago, we had towed the HISPANIOLA.\n\nAs we passed the two-pointed hill, we could see the black mouth of Ben\nGunn's cave and a figure standing by it, leaning on a musket. It was the\nsquire, and we waved a handkerchief and gave him three cheers, in which\nthe voice of Silver joined as heartily as any.\n\nThree miles farther, just inside the mouth of North Inlet, what should\nwe meet but the HISPANIOLA, cruising by herself? The last flood had\nlifted her, and had there been much wind or a strong tide current, as\nin the southern anchorage, we should never have found her more, or found\nher stranded beyond help. As it was, there was little amiss beyond the\nwreck of the main-sail. Another anchor was got ready and dropped in a\nfathom and a half of water. We all pulled round again to Rum Cove,\nthe nearest point for Ben Gunn's treasure-house; and then Gray,\nsingle-handed, returned with the gig to the HISPANIOLA, where he was to\npass the night on guard.\n\nA gentle slope ran up from the beach to the entrance of the cave. At the\ntop, the squire met us. To me he was cordial and kind, saying nothing\nof my escapade either in the way of blame or praise. At Silver's polite\nsalute he somewhat flushed.\n\n“John Silver,” he said, “you're a prodigious villain and imposter--a\nmonstrous imposter, sir. I am told I am not to prosecute you. Well,\nthen, I will not. But the dead men, sir, hang about your neck like\nmill-stones.”\n\n“Thank you kindly, sir,” replied Long John, again saluting.\n\n“I dare you to thank me!” cried the squire. “It is a gross dereliction\nof my duty. Stand back.”\n\nAnd thereupon we all entered the cave. It was a large, airy place, with\na little spring and a pool of clear water, overhung with ferns. The\nfloor was sand. Before a big fire lay Captain Smollett; and in a far\ncorner, only duskily flickered over by the blaze, I beheld great heaps\nof coin and quadrilaterals built of bars of gold. That was Flint's\ntreasure that we had come so far to seek and that had cost already the\nlives of seventeen men from the HISPANIOLA. How many it had cost in the\namassing, what blood and sorrow, what good ships scuttled on the deep,\nwhat brave men walking the plank blindfold, what shot of cannon, what\nshame and lies and cruelty, perhaps no man alive could tell. Yet there\nwere still three upon that island--Silver, and old Morgan, and Ben\nGunn--who had each taken his share in these crimes, as each had hoped in\nvain to share in the reward.\n\n“Come in, Jim,” said the captain. “You're a good boy in your line, Jim,\nbut I don't think you and me'll go to sea again. You're too much of the\nborn favourite for me. Is that you, John Silver? What brings you here,\nman?”\n\n“Come back to my dooty, sir,” returned Silver.\n\n“Ah!” said the captain, and that was all he said.\n\nWhat a supper I had of it that night, with all my friends around me; and\nwhat a meal it was, with Ben Gunn's salted goat and some delicacies and\na bottle of old wine from the HISPANIOLA. Never, I am sure, were people\ngayer or happier. And there was Silver, sitting back almost out of the\nfirelight, but eating heartily, prompt to spring forward when anything\nwas wanted, even joining quietly in our laughter--the same bland,\npolite, obsequious seaman of the voyage out.\n\n\n\n\n34\n\nAnd Last\n\nTHE next morning we fell early to work, for the transportation of this\ngreat mass of gold near a mile by land to the beach, and thence three\nmiles by boat to the HISPANIOLA, was a considerable task for so small\na number of workmen. The three fellows still abroad upon the island did\nnot greatly trouble us; a single sentry on the shoulder of the hill was\nsufficient to ensure us against any sudden onslaught, and we thought,\nbesides, they had had more than enough of fighting.\n\nTherefore the work was pushed on briskly. Gray and Ben Gunn came and\nwent with the boat, while the rest during their absences piled treasure\non the beach. Two of the bars, slung in a rope's end, made a good load\nfor a grown man--one that he was glad to walk slowly with. For my part,\nas I was not much use at carrying, I was kept busy all day in the cave\npacking the minted money into bread-bags.\n\nIt was a strange collection, like Billy Bones's hoard for the diversity\nof coinage, but so much larger and so much more varied that I think I\nnever had more pleasure than in sorting them. English, French, Spanish,\nPortuguese, Georges, and Louises, doubloons and double guineas and\nmoidores and sequins, the pictures of all the kings of Europe for the\nlast hundred years, strange Oriental pieces stamped with what looked\nlike wisps of string or bits of spider's web, round pieces and square\npieces, and pieces bored through the middle, as if to wear them round\nyour neck--nearly every variety of money in the world must, I think,\nhave found a place in that collection; and for number, I am sure they\nwere like autumn leaves, so that my back ached with stooping and my\nfingers with sorting them out.\n\nDay after day this work went on; by every evening a fortune had been\nstowed aboard, but there was another fortune waiting for the morrow; and\nall this time we heard nothing of the three surviving mutineers.\n\nAt last--I think it was on the third night--the doctor and I were\nstrolling on the shoulder of the hill where it overlooks the lowlands of\nthe isle, when, from out the thick darkness below, the wind brought us\na noise between shrieking and singing. It was only a snatch that reached\nour ears, followed by the former silence.\n\n“Heaven forgive them,” said the doctor; “'tis the mutineers!”\n\n“All drunk, sir,” struck in the voice of Silver from behind us.\n\nSilver, I should say, was allowed his entire liberty, and in spite of\ndaily rebuffs, seemed to regard himself once more as quite a privileged\nand friendly dependent. Indeed, it was remarkable how well he bore\nthese slights and with what unwearying politeness he kept on trying to\ningratiate himself with all. Yet, I think, none treated him better than\na dog, unless it was Ben Gunn, who was still terribly afraid of his old\nquartermaster, or myself, who had really something to thank him for;\nalthough for that matter, I suppose, I had reason to think even worse of\nhim than anybody else, for I had seen him meditating a fresh treachery\nupon the plateau. Accordingly, it was pretty gruffly that the doctor\nanswered him.\n\n“Drunk or raving,” said he.\n\n“Right you were, sir,” replied Silver; “and precious little odds which,\nto you and me.”\n\n“I suppose you would hardly ask me to call you a humane man,” returned\nthe doctor with a sneer, “and so my feelings may surprise you, Master\nSilver. But if I were sure they were raving--as I am morally certain\none, at least, of them is down with fever--I should leave this camp,\nand at whatever risk to my own carcass, take them the assistance of my\nskill.”\n\n“Ask your pardon, sir, you would be very wrong,” quoth Silver. “You\nwould lose your precious life, and you may lay to that. I'm on your side\nnow, hand and glove; and I shouldn't wish for to see the party weakened,\nlet alone yourself, seeing as I know what I owes you. But these men down\nthere, they couldn't keep their word--no, not supposing they wished to;\nand what's more, they couldn't believe as you could.”\n\n“No,” said the doctor. “You're the man to keep your word, we know that.”\n\nWell, that was about the last news we had of the three pirates. Only\nonce we heard a gunshot a great way off and supposed them to be hunting.\nA council was held, and it was decided that we must desert them on the\nisland--to the huge glee, I must say, of Ben Gunn, and with the strong\napproval of Gray. We left a good stock of powder and shot, the bulk\nof the salt goat, a few medicines, and some other necessaries, tools,\nclothing, a spare sail, a fathom or two of rope, and by the particular\ndesire of the doctor, a handsome present of tobacco.\n\nThat was about our last doing on the island. Before that, we had got the\ntreasure stowed and had shipped enough water and the remainder of the\ngoat meat in case of any distress; and at last, one fine morning, we\nweighed anchor, which was about all that we could manage, and stood out\nof North Inlet, the same colours flying that the captain had flown and\nfought under at the palisade.\n\nThe three fellows must have been watching us closer than we thought for,\nas we soon had proved. For coming through the narrows, we had to\nlie very near the southern point, and there we saw all three of\nthem kneeling together on a spit of sand, with their arms raised in\nsupplication. It went to all our hearts, I think, to leave them in that\nwretched state; but we could not risk another mutiny; and to take them\nhome for the gibbet would have been a cruel sort of kindness. The doctor\nhailed them and told them of the stores we had left, and where they were\nto find them. But they continued to call us by name and appeal to us,\nfor God's sake, to be merciful and not leave them to die in such a\nplace.\n\nAt last, seeing the ship still bore on her course and was now swiftly\ndrawing out of earshot, one of them--I know not which it was--leapt to\nhis feet with a hoarse cry, whipped his musket to his shoulder, and sent\na shot whistling over Silver's head and through the main-sail.\n\nAfter that, we kept under cover of the bulwarks, and when next I looked\nout they had disappeared from the spit, and the spit itself had almost\nmelted out of sight in the growing distance. That was, at least, the end\nof that; and before noon, to my inexpressible joy, the highest rock of\nTreasure Island had sunk into the blue round of sea.\n\nWe were so short of men that everyone on board had to bear a hand--only\nthe captain lying on a mattress in the stern and giving his orders, for\nthough greatly recovered he was still in want of quiet. We laid her\nhead for the nearest port in Spanish America, for we could not risk the\nvoyage home without fresh hands; and as it was, what with baffling winds\nand a couple of fresh gales, we were all worn out before we reached it.\n\nIt was just at sundown when we cast anchor in a most beautiful\nland-locked gulf, and were immediately surrounded by shore boats full\nof Negroes and Mexican Indians and half-bloods selling fruits and\nvegetables and offering to dive for bits of money. The sight of so many\ngood-humoured faces (especially the blacks), the taste of the tropical\nfruits, and above all the lights that began to shine in the town made a\nmost charming contrast to our dark and bloody sojourn on the island;\nand the doctor and the squire, taking me along with them, went ashore\nto pass the early part of the night. Here they met the captain of an\nEnglish man-of-war, fell in talk with him, went on board his ship, and,\nin short, had so agreeable a time that day was breaking when we came\nalongside the HISPANIOLA.\n\nBen Gunn was on deck alone, and as soon as we came on board he began,\nwith wonderful contortions, to make us a confession. Silver was gone.\nThe maroon had connived at his escape in a shore boat some hours ago,\nand he now assured us he had only done so to preserve our lives, which\nwould certainly have been forfeit if “that man with the one leg\nhad stayed aboard.” But this was not all. The sea-cook had not gone\nempty-handed. He had cut through a bulkhead unobserved and had removed\none of the sacks of coin, worth perhaps three or four hundred guineas,\nto help him on his further wanderings.\n\nI think we were all pleased to be so cheaply quit of him.\n\nWell, to make a long story short, we got a few hands on board, made a\ngood cruise home, and the HISPANIOLA reached Bristol just as Mr. Blandly\nwas beginning to think of fitting out her consort. Five men only of\nthose who had sailed returned with her. “Drink and the devil had done\nfor the rest,” with a vengeance, although, to be sure, we were not quite\nin so bad a case as that other ship they sang about:\n\n     With one man of her crew alive,\n     What put to sea with seventy-five.\n\nAll of us had an ample share of the treasure and used it wisely or\nfoolishly, according to our natures. Captain Smollett is now retired\nfrom the sea. Gray not only saved his money, but being suddenly smit\nwith the desire to rise, also studied his profession, and he is now\nmate and part owner of a fine full-rigged ship, married besides, and the\nfather of a family. As for Ben Gunn, he got a thousand pounds, which he\nspent or lost in three weeks, or to be more exact, in nineteen days, for\nhe was back begging on the twentieth. Then he was given a lodge to keep,\nexactly as he had feared upon the island; and he still lives, a great\nfavourite, though something of a butt, with the country boys, and a\nnotable singer in church on Sundays and saints' days.\n\nOf Silver we have heard no more. That formidable seafaring man with one\nleg has at last gone clean out of my life; but I dare say he met his old\nNegress, and perhaps still lives in comfort with her and Captain Flint.\nIt is to be hoped so, I suppose, for his chances of comfort in another\nworld are very small.\n\nThe bar silver and the arms still lie, for all that I know, where\nFlint buried them; and certainly they shall lie there for me. Oxen and\nwain-ropes would not bring me back again to that accursed island; and\nthe worst dreams that ever I have are when I hear the surf booming about\nits coasts or start upright in bed with the sharp voice of Captain Flint\nstill ringing in my ears: “Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!”",
