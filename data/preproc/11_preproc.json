Down the Rabbit-Hole Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, \u2018and what is the use of a book,\u2019 thought Alice \u2018without pictures or conversations?\u2019 So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her."}, {"size": 733, "text": "There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \u2018Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!\u2019 (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge."}, {"size": 762, "text": "In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again. The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well. Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs."}, {"size": 654, "text": "She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled \u2018ORANGE MARMALADE\u2019, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it. \u2018Well!\u2019 thought Alice to herself, \u2018after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they\u2019ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn\u2019t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!\u2019 (Which was very likely true.) Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! \u2018I wonder how many miles I\u2019ve fallen by this time?\u2019 she said aloud."}, {"size": 609, "text": "\u2018I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think--\u2019 (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) \u2018--yes, that\u2019s about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I\u2019ve got to?\u2019 (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.) Presently she began again."}, {"size": 672, "text": "\u2018I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH the earth! How funny it\u2019ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think--\u2019 (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this time, as it didn\u2019t sound at all the right word) \u2018--but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma\u2019am, is this New Zealand or Australia?\u2019 (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you\u2019re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) \u2018And what an ignorant little girl she\u2019ll think me for asking! No, it\u2019ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.\u2019 Down, down, down."}, {"size": 659, "text": "There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. \u2018Dinah\u2019ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!\u2019 (Dinah was the cat.) \u2018I hope they\u2019ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I\u2019m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that\u2019s very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?\u2019 And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, \u2018Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?\u2019 and sometimes, \u2018Do bats eat cats?\u2019 for, you see, as she couldn\u2019t answer either question, it didn\u2019t much matter which way she put it."}, {"size": 881, "text": "She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, \u2018Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?\u2019 when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over. Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, \u2018Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it\u2019s getting!\u2019 She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof."}, {"size": 787, "text": "There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again. Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice\u2019s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!"}, {"size": 719, "text": "Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; \u2018and even if my head would go through,\u2019 thought poor Alice, \u2018it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.\u2019 For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible."}, {"size": 755, "text": "There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, [\u2018which certainly was not here before,\u2019 said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words \u2018DRINK ME\u2019 beautifully printed on it in large letters. It was all very well to say \u2018Drink me,\u2019 but the wise little Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry. \u2018No, I\u2019ll look first,\u2019 she said, \u2018and see whether it\u2019s marked \u201cpoison\u201d or not\u2019; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because"}, {"size": 620, "text": "they WOULD not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked \u2018poison,\u2019 it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later. However, this bottle was NOT marked \u2018poison,\u2019 so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off."}, {"size": 679, "text": "\u2018What a curious feeling!\u2019 said Alice; \u2018I must be shutting up like a telescope.\u2019And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; \u2018for it might end, you know,\u2019 said Alice to herself, \u2018in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?\u2019 And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing."}, {"size": 757, "text": "After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried. \u2018Come, there\u2019s no use in crying like that!\u2019 said Alice to herself, rather sharply; \u2018I advise you to leave off this minute!\u2019 She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself"}, {"size": 862, "text": "so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. \u2018But it\u2019s no use now,\u2019 thought poor Alice, \u2018to pretend to be two people! Why, there\u2019s hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable person!\u2019 Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words \u2018EAT ME\u2019 were beautifully marked in currants. \u2018Well, I\u2019ll eat it,\u2019 said Alice, \u2018and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I\u2019ll get into the garden, and I don\u2019t care which happens!\u2019 She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, \u2018Which way?"}, {"size": 438, "text": "Which way?\u2019, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way. So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake."}, {"size": 672, "text": "CHAPTER II. The Pool of Tears\u2018Curiouser and curiouser!\u2019 cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); \u2018now I\u2019m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!\u2019 (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off). \u2018Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I\u2019m sure _I_ shan\u2019t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;--but I must be kind to them,\u2019 thought Alice, \u2018or perhaps they won\u2019t walk the way I want to go!"}, {"size": 764, "text": "Let me see: I\u2019ll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.\u2019 And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. \u2018They must go by the carrier,\u2019 she thought; \u2018and how funny it\u2019ll seem, sending presents to one\u2019s own feet! And how odd the directions will look! ALICE\u2019S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ. HEARTHRUG, NEAR THE FENDER, (WITH ALICE\u2019S LOVE). Oh dear, what nonsense I\u2019m talking!\u2019 Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door. Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again."}, {"size": 650, "text": "\u2018You ought to be ashamed of yourself,\u2019 said Alice, \u2018a great girl like you,\u2019 (she might well say this), \u2018to go on crying in this way! Stop this moment, I tell you!\u2019 But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall. After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, \u2018Oh!"}, {"size": 624, "text": "the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won\u2019t she be savage if I\u2019ve kept her waiting!\u2019 Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, \u2018If you please, sir--\u2019 The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go. Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: \u2018Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if I\u2019ve been changed in the night?"}, {"size": 652, "text": "Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different. But if I\u2019m not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I? Ah, THAT\u2019S the great puzzle!\u2019 And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them. \u2018I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not Ada,\u2019 she said, \u2018for her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn\u2019t go in ringlets at all; and I\u2019m sure I can\u2019t be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a very little!

London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and Rome--no, THAT\u2019S all wrong, I\u2019m certain! I must have been changed for Mabel! I\u2019ll try and say \u201cHow doth the little--\u201c\u2019 and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:-- \u2018How doth the little crocodile Improve his shining tail, And pour the waters of the Nile On every golden scale! \u2018How cheerfully he seems to grin, How neatly spread his claws, And welcome little fishes in With gently smiling jaws!\u2019"}, {"size": 700, "text": "\u2018I\u2019m sure those are not the right words,\u2019 said poor Alice, and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, \u2018I must be Mabel after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I\u2019ve made up my mind about it; if I\u2019m Mabel, I\u2019ll stay down here!

Tell me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I\u2019ll come up: if not, I\u2019ll stay down here till I\u2019m somebody else\u201d--but, oh dear!\u2019 cried Alice, with a sudden burst of tears, \u2018I do wish they WOULD put their heads down!"}, {"size": 823, "text": "I am so VERY tired of being all alone here!\u2019 As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit\u2019s little white kid gloves while she was talking. \u2018How CAN I have done that?\u2019 she thought. \u2018I must be growing small again.\u2019 She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether. \u2018That WAS a narrow escape!\u2019 said Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; \u2018and now for the garden!\u2019 and she ran with all speed back to the little door: but, alas!"}, {"size": 896, "text": "the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before, \u2018and things are worse than ever,\u2019 thought the poor child, \u2018for I never was so small as this before, never! And I declare it\u2019s too bad, that it is!\u2019 As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, \u2018and in that case I can go back by railway,\u2019 she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high."}, {"size": 625, "text": "\u2018I wish I hadn\u2019t cried so much!\u2019 said Alice, as she swam about, trying to find her way out. \u2018I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! That WILL be a queer thing, to be sure! However, everything is queer to-day.\u2019 Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself. \u2018Would it be of any use, now,\u2019 thought Alice, \u2018to speak to this mouse?"}, {"size": 753, "text": "Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there\u2019s no harm in trying.\u2019 So she began: \u2018O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!\u2019 (Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having seen in her brother\u2019s Latin Grammar, \u2018A mouse--of a mouse--to a mouse--a mouse--O mouse!\u2019) The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing. \u2018Perhaps it doesn\u2019t understand English,\u2019 thought Alice; \u2018I daresay it\u2019s a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.\u2019 (For, with all her knowledge of history,"}, {"size": 681, "text": "Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) So she began again: \u2018Ou est ma chatte?\u2019 which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. \u2018Oh, I beg your pardon!\u2019 cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal\u2019s feelings. \u2018I quite forgot you didn\u2019t like cats.\u2019 \u2018Not like cats!\u2019 cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. \u2018Would YOU like cats if you were me?\u2019 \u2018Well, perhaps not,\u2019 said Alice in a soothing tone: \u2018don\u2019t be angry about it.

A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it\u2019ll fetch things when you throw them, and it\u2019ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things--I can\u2019t remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer, you know, and he says it\u2019s so useful, it\u2019s worth a hundred pounds! He says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!\u2019 cried Alice in a sorrowful tone, \u2018I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve offended it again!\u2019 For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went."}, {"size": 676, "text": "So she called softly after it, \u2018Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we won\u2019t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don\u2019t like them!\u2019 When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, \u2018Let us get to the shore, and then I\u2019ll tell you my history, and you\u2019ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.\u2019 It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore."}, {"size": 766, "text": "CHAPTER III. A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable. The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, \u2018I am older than you, and must know better\u2019; and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no more to be said."}, {"size": 668, "text": "At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out, \u2018Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I\u2019LL soon make you dry enough!\u2019 They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle.

Alice replied, rather shyly, \u2018I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.\u2019 \u2018What do you mean by that?\u2019 said the Caterpillar sternly. \u2018Explain yourself!\u2019 \u2018I can\u2019t explain MYSELF, I\u2019m afraid, sir\u2019 said Alice, \u2018because I\u2019m not myself, you see.\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t see,\u2019 said the Caterpillar."}, {"size": 631, "text": "\u2018I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t put it more clearly,\u2019 Alice replied very politely, \u2018for I can\u2019t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.\u2019 \u2018It isn\u2019t,\u2019 said the Caterpillar. \u2018Well, perhaps you haven\u2019t found it so yet,\u2019 said Alice; \u2018but when you have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you know--and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you\u2019ll feel it a little queer, won\u2019t you?\u2019 \u2018Not a bit,\u2019 said the Caterpillar. \u2018Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,\u2019 said Alice; \u2018all I know is, it would feel very queer to ME.\u2019 \u2018You!\u2019 said the Caterpillar contemptuously."}, {"size": 619, "text": "\u2018Who are YOU?\u2019 Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation. Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar\u2019s making such VERY short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, \u2018I think, you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.\u2019 \u2018Why?\u2019 said the Caterpillar. Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a VERY unpleasant state of mind, she turned away. \u2018Come back!\u2019 the Caterpillar called after her. \u2018I\u2019ve something important to say!\u2019 This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again."}, {"size": 633, "text": "\u2018Keep your temper,\u2019 said the Caterpillar. \u2018Is that all?\u2019 said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she could. \u2018No,\u2019 said the Caterpillar. Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, \u2018So you think you\u2019re changed, do you?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m afraid I am, sir,\u2019 said Alice; \u2018I can\u2019t remember things as I used--and I don\u2019t keep the same size for ten minutes together!\u2019 \u2018Can\u2019t remember WHAT things?\u2019 said the Caterpillar."}, {"size": 756, "text": "\u2018Well, I\u2019ve tried to say \u201cHOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE,\u201d but it all came different!\u2019 Alice replied in a very melancholy voice. \u2018Repeat, \u201cYOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,\u201d\u2019 said the Caterpillar.
