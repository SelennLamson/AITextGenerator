This commodious ottoman has since been removed, to the extreme regret of all weak-kneed lovers of the fine arts, but the gentleman in question had taken serene possession of its softest spot, and, with his head thrown back and his legs outstretched, was staring at Murillo\u2019s beautiful moon-borne Madonna in profound enjoyment of his posture."}, {"size": 803, "text": "He had removed his hat, and flung down beside him a little red guide-book and an opera-glass. The day was warm; he was heated with walking, and he repeatedly passed his handkerchief over his forehead, with a somewhat wearied gesture. And yet he was evidently not a man to whom fatigue was familiar; long, lean, and muscular, he suggested the sort of vigor that is commonly known as \u201ctoughness.\u201d But his exertions on this particular day had been of an unwonted sort, and he had performed great physical feats which left him less jaded than his tranquil stroll through the Louvre. He had looked out all the pictures to which an asterisk was affixed in those formidable pages of fine print in his B\u00e4deker; his attention had been strained and his eyes dazzled, and he had sat down with an \u00e6sthetic headache."}, {"size": 711, "text": "He had looked, moreover, not only at all the pictures, but at all the copies that were going forward around them, in the hands of those innumerable young women in irreproachable toilets who devote themselves, in France, to the propagation of masterpieces, and if the truth must be told, he had often admired the copy much more than the original. His physiognomy would have sufficiently indicated that he was a shrewd and capable fellow, and in truth he had often sat up all night over a bristling bundle of accounts, and heard the cock crow without a yawn. But Raphael and Titian and Rubens were a new kind of arithmetic, and they inspired our friend, for the first time in his life, with a vague self-mistrust."}, {"size": 693, "text": "An observer with anything of an eye for national types would have had no difficulty in determining the local origin of this undeveloped connoisseur, and indeed such an observer might have felt a certain humorous relish of the almost ideal completeness with which he filled out the national mould. The gentleman on the divan was a powerful specimen of an American. But he was not only a fine American; he was in the first place, physically, a fine man. He appeared to possess that kind of health and strength which, when found in perfection, are the most impressive\u2014the physical capital which the owner does nothing to \u201ckeep up.\u201d If he was a muscular Christian, it was quite without knowing it."}, {"size": 769, "text": "If it was necessary to walk to a remote spot, he walked, but he had never known himself to \u201cexercise.\u201d He had no theory with regard to cold bathing or the use of Indian clubs; he was neither an oarsman, a rifleman, nor a fencer\u2014he had never had time for these amusements\u2014and he was quite unaware that the saddle is recommended for certain forms of indigestion. He was by inclination a temperate man; but he had supped the night before his visit to the Louvre at the Caf\u00e9 Anglais\u2014someone had told him it was an experience not to be omitted\u2014and he had slept none the less the sleep of the just. His usual attitude and carriage were of a rather relaxed and lounging kind, but when under a special inspiration, he straightened himself, he looked like a grenadier on parade."}, {"size": 776, "text": "He never smoked. He had been assured\u2014such things are said\u2014that cigars were excellent for the health, and he was quite capable of believing it; but he knew as little about tobacco as about hom\u0153opathy. He had a very well-formed head, with a shapely, symmetrical balance of the frontal and the occipital development, and a good deal of straight, rather dry brown hair. His complexion was brown, and his nose had a bold well-marked arch. His eye was of a clear, cold gray, and save for a rather abundant moustache he was clean-shaved. He had the flat jaw and sinewy neck which are frequent in the American type; but the traces of national origin are a matter of expression even more than of feature, and it was in this respect that our friend\u2019s countenance was supremely eloquent."}, {"size": 740, "text": "The discriminating observer we have been supposing might, however, perfectly have measured its expressiveness, and yet have been at a loss to describe it. It had that typical vagueness which is not vacuity, that blankness which is not simplicity, that look of being committed to nothing in particular, of standing in an attitude of general hospitality to the chances of life, of being very much at one\u2019s own disposal so characteristic of many American faces. It was our friend\u2019s eye that chiefly told his story; an eye in which innocence and experience were singularly blended. It was full of contradictory suggestions, and though it was by no means the glowing orb of a hero of romance, you could find in it almost anything you looked for."}, {"size": 639, "text": "Frigid and yet friendly, frank yet cautious, shrewd yet credulous, positive yet sceptical, confident yet shy, extremely intelligent and extremely good-humored, there was something vaguely defiant in its concessions, and something profoundly reassuring in its reserve. The cut of this gentleman\u2019s moustache, with the two premature wrinkles in the cheek above it, and the fashion of his garments, in which an exposed shirt-front and a cerulean cravat played perhaps an obtrusive part, completed the conditions of his identity. We have approached him, perhaps, at a not especially favorable moment; he is by no means sitting for his portrait."}, {"size": 630, "text": "But listless as he lounges there, rather baffled on the \u00e6sthetic question, and guilty of the damning fault (as we have lately discovered it to be) of confounding the merit of the artist with that of his work (for he admires the squinting Madonna of the young lady with the boyish coiffure, because he thinks the young lady herself uncommonly taking), he is a sufficiently promising acquaintance. Decision, salubrity, jocosity, prosperity, seem to hover within his call; he is evidently a practical man, but the idea in his case, has undefined and mysterious boundaries, which invite the imagination to bestir itself on his behalf."}, {"size": 641, "text": "As the little copyist proceeded with her work, she sent every now and then a responsive glance toward her admirer. The cultivation of the fine arts appeared to necessitate, to her mind, a great deal of by-play, a great standing off with folded arms and head drooping from side to side, stroking of a dimpled chin with a dimpled hand, sighing and frowning and patting of the foot, fumbling in disordered tresses for wandering hair-pins. These performances were accompanied by a restless glance, which lingered longer than elsewhere upon the gentleman we have described. At last he rose abruptly, put on his hat, and approached the young lady."}, {"size": 766, "text": "He placed himself before her picture and looked at it for some moments, during which she pretended to be quite unconscious of his inspection. Then, addressing her with the single word which constituted the strength of his French vocabulary, and holding up one finger in a manner which appeared to him to illuminate his meaning, \u201c_Combien?_\u201d he abruptly demanded. The artist stared a moment, gave a little pout, shrugged her shoulders, put down her palette and brushes, and stood rubbing her hands. \u201cHow much?\u201d said our friend, in English. \u201c_Combien?_\u201d \u201cMonsieur wishes to buy it?\u201d asked the young lady in French. \u201cVery pretty, _splendide.

She stood looking at him and scratching her chin with the pencil. \u201cIs it not for sale?\u201d he asked. And as she still stood reflecting, and looking at him with an eye which, in spite of her desire to treat this avidity of patronage as a very old story, betrayed an almost touching incredulity, he was afraid he had offended her. She was simply trying to look indifferent, and wondering how far she might go. \u201cI haven\u2019t made a mistake\u2014_pas insult\u00e9_, no?\u201d her interlocutor continued."}, {"size": 645, "text": "\u201cDon\u2019t you understand a little English?\u201d The young lady\u2019s aptitude for playing a part at short notice was remarkable. She fixed him with her conscious, perceptive eye and asked him if he spoke no French. Then, \u201c_Donnez!_\u201d she said briefly, and took the open guide-book. In the upper corner of the fly-leaf she traced a number, in a minute and extremely neat hand. Then she handed back the book and took up her palette again. Our friend read the number: \u201c2,000 francs.\u201d He said nothing for a time, but stood looking at the picture, while the copyist began actively to dabble with her paint. \u201cFor a copy, isn\u2019t that a good deal?\u201d he asked at last."}, {"size": 609, "text": "\u201c_Pas beaucoup?_\u201d The young lady raised her eyes from her palette, scanned him from head to foot, and alighted with admirable sagacity upon exactly the right answer. \u201cYes, it\u2019s a good deal. But my copy has remarkable qualities, it is worth nothing less.\u201d The gentleman in whom we are interested understood no French, but I have said he was intelligent, and here is a good chance to prove it. He apprehended, by a natural instinct, the meaning of the young woman\u2019s phrase, and it gratified him to think that she was so honest.

It was an intensely Western story, and it dealt with enterprises which it will be needless to introduce to the reader in detail. Newman had come out of the war with a brevet of brigadier-general, an honor which in this case\u2014without invidious comparisons\u2014had lighted upon shoulders amply competent to bear it. But though he could manage a fight, when need was, Newman heartily disliked the business; his four years in the army had left him with an angry, bitter sense of the waste of"}, {"size": 717, "text": "precious things\u2014life and time and money and \u201csmartness\u201d and the early freshness of purpose; and he had addressed himself to the pursuits of peace with passionate zest and energy. He was of course as penniless when he plucked off his shoulder-straps as when he put them on, and the only capital at his disposal was his dogged resolution and his lively perception of ends and means. Exertion and action were as natural to him as respiration; a more completely healthy mortal had never trod the elastic soil of the West.

His most vivid conception of a supernatural element in the world\u2019s affairs had come to him once when this pertinacity of misfortune was at its climax; there seemed to him something stronger in life than his own will. But the mysterious something could only be the devil, and he was accordingly seized with an intense personal enmity to this impertinent force. He had known what it was to have utterly exhausted his credit, to be unable to raise a dollar, and to find himself at nightfall in a strange city, without a penny to mitigate its strangeness."}, {"size": 772, "text": "It was under these circumstances that he made his entrance into San Francisco, the scene, subsequently, of his happiest strokes of fortune. If he did not, like Dr. Franklin in Philadelphia, march along the street munching a penny-loaf, it was only because he had not the penny-loaf necessary to the performance. In his darkest days he had had but one simple, practical impulse\u2014the desire, as he would have phrased it, to see the thing through. He did so at last, buffeted his way into smooth waters, and made money largely. It must be admitted, rather nakedly, that Christopher Newman\u2019s sole aim in life had been to make money; what he had been placed in the world for was, to his own perception, simply to wrest a fortune, the bigger the better, from defiant opportunity."}, {"size": 766, "text": "This idea completely filled his horizon and satisfied his imagination. Upon the uses of money, upon what one might do with a life into which one had succeeded in injecting the golden stream, he had up to his thirty-fifth year very scantily reflected.

He was a man to whom, sooner or later, the question was sure to present itself, and the answer to it belongs to our story.

Mr. and Mrs. Tristram lived behind one of those chalk-colored fa\u00e7ades which decorate with their pompous sameness the broad avenues manufactured by Baron Haussmann in the neighborhood of the Arc de Triomphe."}, {"size": 602, "text": "Their apartment was rich in the modern conveniences, and Tristram lost no time in calling his visitor\u2019s attention to their principal household treasures, the gas-lamps and the furnace-holes. \u201cWhenever you feel homesick,\u201d he said, \u201cyou must come up here. We\u2019ll stick you down before a register, under a good big burner, and\u2014\u201d \u201cAnd you will soon get over your homesickness,\u201d said Mrs. Tristram.

Her taste on many points differed from that of her husband, and though she made frequent concessions it must be confessed that her concessions were not always graceful. They were founded upon a vague project she had of some day doing something very positive, something a trifle passionate. What she meant to do she could by no means have told you; but meanwhile, nevertheless, she was buying a good conscience, by instalments. It should be added, without delay, to anticipate misconception, that her little scheme of independence did not definitely involve the assistance of another person, of the opposite sex; she was not saving up virtue to cover the expenses of a flirtation."}, {"size": 687, "text": "For this there were various reasons. To begin with, she had a very plain face and she was entirely without illusions as to her appearance. She had taken its measure to a hair\u2019s breadth, she knew the worst and the best, she had accepted herself. It had not been, indeed, without a struggle. As a young girl she had spent hours with her back to her mirror, crying her eyes out; and later she had from desperation and bravado adopted the habit of proclaiming herself the most ill-favored of women, in order that she might\u2014as in common politeness was inevitable\u2014be contradicted and reassured. It was since she had come to live in Europe that she had begun to take the matter philosophically."}, {"size": 659, "text": "Her observation, acutely exercised here, had suggested to her that a woman\u2019s first duty is not to be beautiful, but to be pleasing, and she encountered so many women who pleased without beauty that she began to feel that she had discovered her mission. She had once heard an enthusiastic musician, out of patience with a gifted bungler, declare that a fine voice is really an obstacle to singing properly; and it occurred to her that it might perhaps be equally true that a beautiful face is an obstacle to the acquisition of charming manners. Mrs. Tristram, then, undertook to be exquisitely agreeable, and she brought to the task a really touching devotion."}, {"size": 603, "text": "How well she would have succeeded I am unable to say; unfortunately she broke off in the middle. Her own excuse was the want of encouragement in her immediate circle. But I am inclined to think that she had not a real genius for the matter, or she would have pursued the charming art for itself. The poor lady was very incomplete. She fell back upon the harmonies of the toilet, which she thoroughly understood, and contented herself with dressing in perfection. She lived in Paris, which she pretended to detest, because it was only in Paris that one could find things to exactly suit one\u2019s complexion."}, {"size": 614, "text": "Besides out of Paris it was always more or less of a trouble to get ten-button gloves. When she railed at this serviceable city and you asked her where she would prefer to reside, she returned some very unexpected answer. She would say in Copenhagen, or in Barcelona; having, while making the tour of Europe, spent a couple of days at each of these places. On the whole, with her poetic furbelows and her misshapen, intelligent little face, she was, when you knew her, a decidedly interesting woman. She was naturally shy, and if she had been born a beauty, she would (having no vanity) probably have remained shy."}, {"size": 806, "text": "Now, she was both diffident and importunate; extremely reserved sometimes with her friends, and strangely expansive with strangers. She despised her husband; despised him too much, for she had been perfectly at liberty not to marry him. She had been in love with a clever man who had slighted her, and she had married a fool in the hope that this thankless wit, reflecting on it, would conclude that she had no appreciation of merit, and that he had flattered himself in supposing that she cared for his own. Restless, discontented, visionary, without personal ambitions, but with a certain avidity of imagination, she was, as I have said before, eminently incomplete. She was full\u2014both for good and for ill\u2014of beginnings that came to nothing; but she had nevertheless, morally, a spark of the sacred fire."}, {"size": 759, "text": "Newman was fond, under all circumstances, of the society of women, and now that he was out of his native element and deprived of his habitual interests, he turned to it for compensation. He took a great fancy to Mrs. Tristram; she frankly repaid it, and after their first meeting he passed a great many hours in her drawing-room. After two or three talks they were fast friends. Newman\u2019s manner with women was peculiar, and it required some ingenuity on a lady\u2019s part to discover that he admired her. He had no gallantry, in the usual sense of the term; no compliments, no graces, no speeches. Very fond of what is called chaffing, in his dealings with men, he never found himself on a sofa beside a member of the softer sex without feeling extremely serious."}, {"size": 620, "text": "He was not shy, and so far as awkwardness proceeds from a struggle with shyness, he was not awkward; grave, attentive, submissive, often silent, he was simply swimming in a sort of rapture of respect. This emotion was not at all theoretic, it was not even in a high degree sentimental; he had thought very little about the \u201cposition\u201d of women, and he was not familiar either sympathetically or otherwise, with the image of a President in petticoats. His attitude was simply the flower of his general good-nature, and a part of his instinctive and genuinely democratic assumption of everyone\u2019s right to lead an easy life."}, {"size": 817, "text": "If a shaggy pauper had a right to bed and board and wages and a vote, women, of course, who were weaker than paupers, and whose physical tissue was in itself an appeal, should be maintained, sentimentally, at the public expense. Newman was willing to be taxed for this purpose, largely, in proportion to his means. Moreover, many of the common traditions with regard to women were with him fresh personal impressions; he had never read a novel! He had been struck with their acuteness, their subtlety, their tact, their felicity of judgment. They seemed to him exquisitely organized. If it is true that one must always have in one\u2019s work here below a religion, or at least an ideal, of some sort, Newman found his metaphysical inspiration in a vague acceptance of final responsibility to some illumined feminine brow."}, {"size": 601, "text": "He spent a great deal of time in listening to advice from Mrs. Tristram; advice, it must be added, for which he had never asked. He would have been incapable of asking for it, for he had no perception of difficulties, and consequently no curiosity about remedies. The complex Parisian world about him seemed a very simple affair; it was an immense, amazing spectacle, but it neither inflamed his imagination nor irritated his curiosity. He kept his hands in his pockets, looked on good-humoredly, desired to miss nothing important, observed a great many things narrowly, and never reverted to himself."}, {"size": 610, "text": "Mrs. Tristram\u2019s \u201cadvice\u201d was a part of the show, and a more entertaining element, in her abundant gossip, than the others. He enjoyed her talking about himself; it seemed a part of her beautiful ingenuity; but he never made an application of anything she said, or remembered it when he was away from her. For herself, she appropriated him; he was the most interesting thing she had had to think about in many a month. She wished to do something with him\u2014she hardly knew what. There was so much of him; he was so rich and robust, so easy, friendly, well-disposed, that he kept her fancy constantly on the alert."}, {"size": 643, "text": "For the present, the only thing she could do was to like him. She told him that he was \u201chorribly Western,\u201d but in this compliment the adverb was tinged with insincerity. She led him about with her, introduced him to fifty people, and took extreme satisfaction in her conquest. Newman accepted every proposal, shook hands universally and promiscuously, and seemed equally unfamiliar with trepidation or with elation. Tom Tristram complained of his wife\u2019s avidity, and declared that he could never have a clear five minutes with his friend. If he had known how things were going to turn out, he never would have brought him to the Avenue d\u2019I\u00e9na."}, {"size": 687, "text": "The two men, formerly, had not been intimate, but Newman remembered his earlier impression of his host, and did Mrs. Tristram, who had by no means taken him into her confidence, but whose secret he presently discovered, the justice to admit that her husband was a rather degenerate mortal. At twenty-five he had been a good fellow, and in this respect he was unchanged; but of a man of his age one expected something more. People said he was sociable, but this was as much a matter of course as for a dipped sponge to expand; and it was not a high order of sociability. He was a great gossip and tattler, and to produce a laugh would hardly have spared the reputation of his aged mother."}, {"size": 637, "text": "Newman had a kindness for old memories, but he found it impossible not to perceive that Tristram was nowadays a very light weight. His only aspirations were to hold out at poker, at his club, to know the names of all the _cocottes_, to shake hands all round, to ply his rosy gullet with truffles and champagne, and to create uncomfortable eddies and obstructions among the constituent atoms of the American colony. He was shamefully idle, spiritless, sensual, snobbish. He irritated our friend by the tone of his allusions to their native country, and Newman was at a loss to understand why the United States were not good enough for Mr."}, {"size": 606, "text": "Tristram. He had never been a very conscious patriot, but it vexed him to see them treated as little better than a vulgar smell in his friend\u2019s nostrils, and he finally broke out and swore that they were the greatest country in the world, that they could put all Europe into their breeches\u2019 pockets, and that an American who spoke ill of them ought to be carried home in irons and compelled to live in Boston. (This, for Newman was putting it very vindictively.) Tristram was a comfortable man to snub, he bore no malice, and he continued to insist on Newman\u2019s finishing his evening at the Occidental Club."}, {"size": 669, "text": "Christopher Newman dined several times in the Avenue d\u2019I\u00e9na, and his host always proposed an early adjournment to this institution.

Sometimes Newman kept his promise of following Mr. Tristram, in half an hour, to the Occidental, and sometimes he forgot it. His hostess asked him a great many questions about himself, but on this subject he was an indifferent talker. He was not what is called subjective, though when he felt that her interest was sincere, he made an almost heroic attempt to be. He told her a great many things he had done, and regaled her with anecdotes of Western life; she was from Philadelphia, and with her eight years in Paris, talked of herself as a languid Oriental."}, {"size": 619, "text": "But some other person was always the hero of the tale, by no means always to his advantage; and Newman\u2019s own emotions were but scantily chronicled.

He hesitated a while, and at last he said, \u201cNo!\u201d She declared that she was delighted to hear it, as it confirmed her private conviction that he was a man of no feeling. \u201cReally?\u201d he asked, very gravely. \u201cDo you think so?

In the charming city of Brussels\u2014his first stopping-place after leaving Paris\u2014he asked a great many questions about the street-cars, and took extreme satisfaction in the reappearance of this familiar symbol of American civilization; but he was also greatly struck with the beautiful Gothic tower of the H\u00f4tel de Ville, and wondered whether it would not be possible to \u201cget up\u201d something like it in San Francisco."}, {"size": 734, "text": "He stood for half an hour in the crowded square before this edifice, in imminent danger from carriage-wheels, listening to a toothless old cicerone mumble in broken English the touching history of Counts Egmont and Horn; and he wrote the names of these gentlemen\u2014for reasons best known to himself\u2014on the back of an old letter. At the outset, on his leaving Paris, his curiosity had not been intense; passive entertainment, in the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es and at the theatres, seemed about as much as he need expect of himself, and although, as he had said to Tristram, he wanted to see the mysterious, satisfying _best_, he had not the Grand Tour in the least on his conscience, and was not given to cross-questioning the amusement of the hour."}, {"size": 731, "text": "He believed that Europe was made for him, and not he for Europe. He had said that he wanted to improve his mind, but he would have felt a certain embarrassment, a certain shame, even\u2014a false shame, possibly\u2014if he had caught himself looking intellectually into the mirror. Neither in this nor in any other respect had Newman a high sense of responsibility; it was his prime conviction that a man\u2019s life should be easy, and that he should be able to resolve privilege into a matter of course. The world, to his sense, was a great bazaar, where one might stroll about and purchase handsome things; but he was no more conscious, individually, of social pressure than he admitted the existence of such a thing as an obligatory purchase."}, {"size": 821, "text": "He had not only a dislike, but a sort of moral mistrust, of uncomfortable thoughts, and it was both uncomfortable and slightly contemptible to feel obliged to square one\u2019s self with a standard. One\u2019s standard was the ideal of one\u2019s own good-humored prosperity, the prosperity which enabled one to give as well as take. To expand, without bothering about it\u2014without shiftless timidity on one side, or loquacious eagerness on the other\u2014to the full compass of what he would have called a \u201cpleasant\u201d experience, was Newman\u2019s most definite programme of life. He had always hated to hurry to catch railroad trains, and yet he had always caught them; and just so an undue solicitude for \u201cculture\u201d seemed a sort of silly dawdling at the station, a proceeding properly confined to women, foreigners, and other unpractical persons."}, {"size": 760, "text": "All this admitted, Newman enjoyed his journey, when once he had fairly entered the current, as profoundly as the most zealous _dilettante_. One\u2019s theories, after all, matter little; it is one\u2019s humor that is the great thing. Our friend was intelligent, and he could not help that. He lounged through Belgium and Holland and the Rhineland, through Switzerland and Northern Italy, planning about nothing, but seeing everything. The guides and _valets de place_ found him an excellent subject. He was always approachable, for he was much addicted to standing about in the vestibules and porticos of inns, and he availed himself little of the opportunities for impressive seclusion which are so liberally offered in Europe to gentlemen who travel with long purses."}, {"size": 639, "text": "When an excursion, a church, a gallery, a ruin, was proposed to him, the first thing Newman usually did, after surveying his postulant in silence, from head to foot, was to sit down at a little table and order something to drink. The cicerone, during this process, usually retreated to a respectful distance; otherwise I am not sure that Newman would not have bidden him sit down and have a glass also, and tell him as an honest fellow whether his church or his gallery was really worth a man\u2019s trouble. At last he rose and stretched his long legs, beckoned to the man of monuments, looked at his watch, and fixed his eye on his adversary."}, {"size": 735, "text": "\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked. \u201cHow far?\u201d And whatever the answer was, although he sometimes seemed to hesitate, he never declined. He stepped into an open cab, made his conductor sit beside him to answer questions, bade the driver go fast (he had a particular aversion to slow driving) and rolled, in all probability through a dusty suburb, to the goal of his pilgrimage. If the goal was a disappointment, if the church was meagre, or the ruin a heap of rubbish, Newman never protested or berated his cicerone; he looked with an impartial eye upon great monuments and small, made the guide recite his lesson, listened to it religiously, asked if there was nothing else to be seen in the neighborhood, and drove back again at a rattling pace."}, {"size": 716, "text": "It is to be feared that his perception of the difference between good architecture and bad was not acute, and that he might sometimes have been seen gazing with culpable serenity at inferior productions. Ugly churches were a part of his pastime in Europe, as well as beautiful ones, and his tour was altogether a pastime. But there is sometimes nothing like the imagination of these people who have none, and Newman, now and then, in an unguided stroll in a foreign city, before some lonely, sad-towered church, or some angular image of one who had rendered civic service in an unknown past, had felt a singular inward tremor. It was not an excitement or a perplexity; it was a placid, fathomless sense of diversion."}, {"size": 877, "text": "He encountered by chance in Holland a young American, with whom, for a time, he formed a sort of traveler\u2019s partnership. They were men of a very different cast, but each, in his way, was so good a fellow that, for a few weeks at least, it seemed something of a pleasure to share the chances of the road. Newman\u2019s comrade, whose name was Babcock, was a young Unitarian minister, a small, spare, neatly-attired man, with a strikingly candid physiognomy. He was a native of Dorchester, Massachusetts, and had spiritual charge of a small congregation in another suburb of the New England metropolis. His digestion was weak and he lived chiefly on Graham bread and hominy\u2014a regimen to which he was so much attached that his tour seemed to him destined to be blighted when, on landing on the Continent, he found that these delicacies did not flourish under the _table d\u2019h\u00f4te_ system."}, {"size": 897, "text": "In Paris he had purchased a bag of hominy at an establishment which called itself an American Agency, and at which the New York illustrated papers were also to be procured, and he had carried it about with him, and shown extreme serenity and fortitude in the somewhat delicate position of having his hominy prepared for him and served at anomalous hours, at the hotels he successively visited. Newman had once spent a morning, in the course of business, at Mr. Babcock\u2019s birthplace, and, for reasons too recondite to unfold, his visit there always assumed in his mind a jocular cast. To carry out his joke, which certainly seems poor so long as it is not explained, he used often to address his companion as \u201cDorchester.\u201d Fellow-travelers very soon grow intimate but it is highly improbable that at home these extremely dissimilar characters would have found any very convenient points of contact."}, {"size": 607, "text": "They were, indeed, as different as possible. Newman, who never reflected on such matters, accepted the situation with great equanimity, but Babcock used to meditate over it privately; used often, indeed, to retire to his room early in the evening for the express purpose of considering it conscientiously and impartially. He was not sure that it was a good thing for him to associate with our hero, whose way of taking life was so little his own. Newman was an excellent, generous fellow; Mr. Babcock sometimes said to himself that he was a _noble_ fellow, and, certainly, it was impossible not to like him."}, {"size": 648, "text": "But would it not be desirable to try to exert an influence upon him, to try to quicken his moral life and sharpen his sense of duty? He liked everything, he accepted everything, he found amusement in everything; he was not discriminating, he had not a high tone. The young man from Dorchester accused Newman of a fault which he considered very grave, and which he did his best to avoid: what he would have called a want of \u201cmoral reaction.\u201d Poor Mr. Babcock was extremely fond of pictures and churches, and carried Mrs. Jameson\u2019s works about in his trunk; he delighted in \u00e6sthetic analysis, and received peculiar impressions from everything he saw."}, {"size": 729, "text": "But nevertheless in his secret soul he detested Europe, and he felt an irritating need to protest against Newman\u2019s gross intellectual hospitality. Mr. Babcock\u2019s moral _malaise_, I am afraid, lay deeper than where any definition of mine can reach it. He mistrusted the European temperament, he suffered from the European climate, he hated the European dinner-hour; European life seemed to him unscrupulous and impure. And yet he had an exquisite sense of beauty; and as beauty was often inextricably associated with the above displeasing conditions, as he wished, above all, to be just and dispassionate, and as he was, furthermore, extremely devoted to \u201cculture,\u201d he could not bring himself to decide that Europe was utterly bad."}, {"size": 727, "text": "But he thought it was very bad indeed, and his quarrel with Newman was that this unregulated epicure had a sadly insufficient perception of the bad. Babcock himself really knew as little about the bad, in any quarter of the world, as a nursing infant, his most vivid realization of evil had been the discovery that one of his college classmates, who was studying architecture in Paris had a love affair with a young woman who did not expect him to marry her. Babcock had related this incident to Newman, and our hero had applied an epithet of an unflattering sort to the young girl. The next day his companion asked him whether he was very sure he had used exactly the right word to characterize the young architect\u2019s mistress."}, {"size": 876, "text": "Newman stared and laughed. \u201cThere are a great many words to express that idea,\u201d he said; \u201cyou can take your choice!\u201d \u201cOh, I mean,\u201d said Babcock, \u201cwas she possibly not to be considered in a different light? Don\u2019t you think she _really_ expected him to marry her?\u201d \u201cI am sure I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Newman. \u201cVery likely she did; I have no doubt she is a grand woman.\u201d And he began to laugh again. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean that either,\u201d said Babcock, \u201cI was only afraid that I might have seemed yesterday not to remember\u2014not to consider; well, I think I will write to Percival about it.\u201d And he had written to Percival (who answered him in a really impudent fashion), and he had reflected that it was somehow, raw and reckless in Newman to assume in that off-hand manner that the young woman in Paris might be \u201cgrand.\u201d The brevity of Newman\u2019s judgments very often shocked and discomposed him."}, {"size": 647, "text": "He had a way of damning people without farther appeal, or of pronouncing them capital company in the face of uncomfortable symptoms, which seemed unworthy of a man whose conscience had been properly cultivated. And yet poor Babcock liked him, and remembered that even if he was sometimes perplexing and painful, this was not a reason for giving him up. Goethe recommended seeing human nature in the most various forms, and Mr. Babcock thought Goethe perfectly splendid. He often tried, in odd half-hours of conversation to infuse into Newman a little of his own spiritual starch, but Newman\u2019s personal texture was too loose to admit of stiffening."}, {"size": 603, "text": "His mind could no more hold principles than a sieve can hold water. He admired principles extremely, and thought Babcock a mighty fine little fellow for having so many. He accepted all that his high-strung companion offered him, and put them away in what he supposed to be a very safe place; but poor Babcock never afterwards recognized his gifts among the articles that Newman had in daily use. They traveled together through Germany and into Switzerland, where for three or four weeks they trudged over passes and lounged upon blue lakes. At last they crossed the Simplon and made their way to Venice."}, {"size": 682, "text": "Mr. Babcock had become gloomy and even a trifle irritable; he seemed moody, absent, preoccupied; he got his plans into a tangle, and talked one moment of doing one thing and the next of doing another. Newman led his usual life, made acquaintances, took his ease in the galleries and churches, spent an unconscionable amount of time in strolling in the Piazza San Marco, bought a great many bad pictures, and for a fortnight enjoyed Venice grossly. One evening, coming back to his inn, he found Babcock waiting for him in the little garden beside it. The young man walked up to him, looking very dismal, thrust out his hand, and said with solemnity that he was afraid they must part."}, {"size": 615, "text": "Newman expressed his surprise and regret, and asked why a parting had become necessary. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid I\u2019m tired of you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are not tired of me?\u201d demanded Babcock, fixing him with his clear gray eye. \u201cWhy the deuce should I be? You are a very plucky fellow. Besides, I don\u2019t grow tired of things.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t understand each other,\u201d said the young minister. \u201cDon\u2019t I understand you?\u201d cried Newman. \u201cWhy, I hoped I did. But what if I don\u2019t; where\u2019s the harm?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t understand _you_,\u201d said Babcock.

We can never agree.\u201d \u201cBut we have agreed very well all along.\u201d \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t agreed,\u201d said Babcock, shaking his head. \u201cI am very uncomfortable.

A few days afterwards Newman received a note from his late companion which ran as follows:\u2014 My Dear Mr. Newman,\u2014I am afraid that my conduct at Venice, a week ago, seemed to you strange and ungrateful, and I wish to explain my position, which, as I said at the time, I do not think you appreciate."}, {"size": 680, "text": "I had long had it on my mind to propose that we should part company, and this step was not really so abrupt as it seemed. In the first place, you know, I am traveling in Europe on funds supplied by my congregation, who kindly offered me a vacation and an opportunity to enrich my mind with the treasures of nature and art in the Old World. I feel, therefore, as if I ought to use my time to the very best advantage. I have a high sense of responsibility. You appear to care only for the pleasure of the hour, and you give yourself up to it with a violence which I confess I am not able to emulate. I feel as if I must arrive at some conclusion and fix my belief on certain points."}, {"size": 686, "text": "Art and life seem to me intensely serious things, and in our travels in Europe we should especially remember the immense seriousness of Art. You seem to hold that if a thing amuses you for the moment, that is all you need ask for it, and your relish for mere amusement is also much higher than mine. You put, however, a kind of reckless confidence into your pleasure which at times, I confess, has seemed to me\u2014shall I say it?\u2014almost cynical. Your way at any rate is not my way, and it is unwise that we should attempt any longer to pull together.

I am greatly perplexed by Luini.This letter produced in Newman\u2019s mind a singular mixture of exhilaration and awe. At first, Mr. Babcock\u2019s tender conscience seemed to him a capital farce, and his traveling back to Milan only to get into a deeper muddle appeared, as the reward of his pedantry, exquisitely and ludicrously just. Then Newman reflected that these are mighty mysteries, that possibly he himself was indeed that baleful and barely mentionable thing, a cynic, and that his manner of considering the treasures of art and the privileges of life was probably very base and immoral. Newman had a great contempt for immorality, and that evening, for a good half hour, as he sat watching the star-sheen on the warm Adriatic, he felt rebuked and depressed."}, {"size": 695, "text": "He was at a loss how to answer Babcock\u2019s letter. His good nature checked his resenting the young minister\u2019s lofty admonitions, and his tough, inelastic sense of humor forbade his taking them seriously. He wrote no answer at all but a day or two afterward he found in a curiosity shop a grotesque little statuette in ivory, of the sixteenth century, which he sent off to Babcock without a commentary. It represented a gaunt, ascetic-looking monk, in a tattered gown and cowl, kneeling with clasped hands and pulling a portentously long face. It was a wonderfully delicate piece of carving, and in a moment, through one of the rents of his gown, you espied a fat capon hung round the monk\u2019s waist."}, {"size": 630, "text": "In Newman\u2019s intention what did the figure symbolize? Did it mean that he was going to try to be as \u201chigh-toned\u201d as the monk looked at first, but that he feared he should succeed no better than the friar, on a closer inspection, proved to have done? It is not supposable that he intended a satire upon Babcock\u2019s own asceticism, for this would have been a truly cynical stroke. He made his late companion, at any rate, a very valuable little present. Newman, on leaving Venice, went through the Tyrol to Vienna, and then returned westward, through Southern Germany. The autumn found him at Baden-Baden, where he spent several weeks."}, {"size": 641, "text": "The place was charming, and he was in no hurry to depart; besides, he was looking about him and deciding what to do for the winter. His summer had been very full, and he sat under the great trees beside the miniature river that trickles past the Baden flower-beds, he slowly rummaged it over. He had seen and done a great deal, enjoyed and observed a great deal; he felt older, and yet he felt younger too. He remembered Mr. Babcock and his desire to form conclusions, and he remembered also that he had profited very little by his friend\u2019s exhortation to cultivate the same respectable habit. Could he not scrape together a few conclusions?"}, {"size": 676, "text": "Baden-Baden was the prettiest place he had seen yet, and orchestral music in the evening, under the stars, was decidedly a great institution. This was one of his conclusions! But he went on to reflect that he had done very wisely to pull up stakes and come abroad; this seeing of the world was a very interesting thing. He had learned a great deal; he couldn\u2019t say just what, but he had it there under his hat-band. He had done what he wanted; he had seen the great things, and he had given his mind a chance to \u201cimprove,\u201d if it would. He cheerfully believed that it had improved.

He had told Tristram that the pendulum was swinging back and it appeared that the backward swing had not yet ended.

And, in fact, many of the qualities that make a great deed were there: the decision, the resolution, the courage, the celerity, the clear eye, and the strong hand. Of certain other achievements it would be going too far to say that he was ashamed of them for Newman had never had a stomach for dirty work."}, {"size": 757, "text": "He was blessed with a natural impulse to disfigure with a direct, unreasoning blow the comely visage of temptation. And certainly, in no man could a want of integrity have been less excusable. Newman knew the crooked from the straight at a glance, and the former had cost him, first and last, a great many moments of lively disgust. But none the less some of his memories seemed to wear at present a rather graceless and sordid mien, and it struck him that if he had never done anything very ugly, he had never, on the other hand, done anything particularly beautiful.

It had come back to him simply that what he had been looking at all summer was a very rich and beautiful world, and that it had not all been made by sharp railroad men and stock-brokers. During his stay at Baden-Baden he received a letter from Mrs. Tristram, scolding him for the scanty tidings he had sent to his friends of the Avenue d\u2019I\u00e9na, and begging to be definitely informed that he had not concocted any horrid scheme for wintering in outlying regions, but was coming back sanely and promptly to the most comfortable city in the world.

Gallant, expansive, amusing, more pleased himself with the effect he produced than those (even when they were well pleased) for whom he produced it; a master of all the distinctively social virtues and a votary of all agreeable sensations; a devotee of something mysterious and sacred to which he occasionally alluded in terms more ecstatic even than those in which he spoke of the last pretty woman, and which was simply the beautiful"}, {"size": 750, "text": "though somewhat superannuated image of _honor_; he was irresistibly entertaining and enlivening, and he formed a character to which Newman was as capable of doing justice when he had once been placed in contact with it, as he was unlikely, in musing upon the possible mixtures of our human ingredients, mentally to have foreshadowed it. Bellegarde did not in the least cause him to modify his needful premise that all Frenchmen are of a frothy and imponderable substance; he simply reminded him that light materials may be beaten up into a most agreeable compound. No two companions could be more different, but their differences made a capital basis for a friendship of which the distinctive characteristic was that it was extremely amusing to each."}, {"size": 678, "text": "Valentin de Bellegarde lived in the basement of an old house in the Rue d\u2019Anjou St. Honor\u00e9, and his small apartments lay between the court of the house and an old garden which spread itself behind it\u2014one of those large, sunless humid gardens into which you look unexpectingly in Paris from back windows, wondering how among the grudging habitations they find their space.

The young man\u2019s possessions were in picturesque disorder, and his apartment was pervaded by the odor of cigars, mingled with perfumes more inscrutable.

They are tolerably depraved, my contemporaries!\u201d He said wonderfully pretty things about his female friends, and, numerous and various as they had been, declared that on the whole there was more good in them than harm. \u201cBut you are not to take that as advice,\u201d he added. \u201cAs an authority I am very untrustworthy. I\u2019m prejudiced in their favor; I\u2019m an _idealist!_\u201d Newman listened to him with his impartial smile, and was glad, for his own sake, that he had fine feelings; but he mentally repudiated the idea of a Frenchman having discovered any merit in the amiable sex which he himself did not suspect."}, {"size": 677, "text": "M. de Bellegarde, however, did not confine his conversation to the autobiographical channel; he questioned our hero largely as to the events of his own life, and Newman told him some better stories than any that Bellegarde carried in his budget.

Some of the ladies looked at him very hard\u2014or very soft, as you please; others seemed profoundly unconscious of his presence. The men looked only at Madame de Cintr\u00e9.

Whether she rose or seated herself; whether she went with her departing friends to the door and lifted up the heavy curtain as they passed out, and stood an instant looking after them and giving them the last nod; or whether she leaned back in her chair with her arms crossed and her eyes resting, listening and smiling; she gave Newman the feeling that he should like to have her always before him, moving slowly to and fro along the whole scale of expressive hospitality."}, {"size": 764, "text": "If it might be _to_ him, it would be well; if it might be _for_ him, it would be still better!

He could not have told you what warrant he had for talking about mysteries; if it had been his habit to express himself in poetic figures he might have said that in observing Madame de Cintr\u00e9 he seemed to see the vague circle which sometimes accompanies the partly-filled disk of the moon.

My specialty has been to make the largest possible fortune in the shortest possible time.\u201d Newman made this last remark very deliberately; he wished to open the way, if it were necessary, to an authoritative statement of his means. M. de Bellegarde laughed agreeably. \u201cI hope you have succeeded,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, I have made a fortune in a reasonable time. I am not so old, you see.\u201d \u201cParis is a very good place to spend a fortune.

Yet Newman was not irritated; he did not feel that he was being patronized; he was conscious of no especial impulse to introduce a discord into so noble a harmony.

Love, he believed, made a fool of a man, and his present emotion was not folly but wisdom; wisdom sound, serene, well-directed.

It must be confessed that the number of subjects upon which Newman had no ideas was extremely large, and it must be added that as regards those subjects upon which he was without ideas he was also perfectly without words.

What it was that entertained him during some of his speechless sessions I must, however, confess myself unable to determine.

M. de Bellegarde answered with suave concision that he thought as ill of them as possible, that they were going from bad to worse, and that the age was rotten to its core.

Newman stared, and after this he ceased to talk politics with M. de Bellegarde. He was not horrified nor scandalized, he was not even amused; he felt as he should have felt if he had discovered in M. de Bellegarde a taste for certain oddities of diet; an appetite, for instance, for fishbones or nutshells.

The way to church, up the hill, was impracticable to vehicles. It was lined with peasants, two or three rows deep, who stood watching old Madame de Bellegarde slowly ascend it, on the arm of her elder son, behind the pall-bearers of the other."}, {"size": 687, "text": "Newman chose to lurk among the common mourners who murmured \u201cMadame la Comtesse\u201d as a tall figure veiled in black passed before them. He stood in the dusky little church while the service was going forward, but at the dismal tomb-side he turned away and walked down the hill. He went back to Poitiers, and spent two days in which patience and impatience were singularly commingled. On the third day he sent Madame de Cintr\u00e9 a note, saying that he would call upon her in the afternoon, and in accordance with this he again took his way to Fleuri\u00e8res.

Advancing farther, he found himself before a vast iron gate, rusty and closed; here he paused a moment, looking through the bars. The ch\u00e2teau was near the road; this was at once its merit and its defect; but its aspect was extremely impressive.

Two towers rose behind, and behind the towers was a mass of elms and beeches, now just faintly green. But the great feature was a wide, green river which washed the foundations of the ch\u00e2teau. The building rose from an island in the circling stream, so that this formed a perfect moat spanned by a two-arched bridge without a parapet. The dull brick walls, which here and there made a grand, straight sweep; the ugly little cupolas of the wings, the deep-set windows, the long, steep pinnacles of mossy slate, all mirrored themselves in the tranquil river."}, {"size": 737, "text": "Newman rang at the gate, and was almost frightened at the tone with which a big rusty bell above his head replied to him.

At the door of the ch\u00e2teau he waited for some moments, and this gave him a chance to observe that Fleuri\u00e8res was not \u201ckept up,\u201d and to reflect that it was a melancholy place of residence. \u201cIt looks,\u201d said Newman to himself\u2014and I give the comparison for what it is worth\u2014\u201clike a Chinese penitentiary.\u201d At last the door was opened by a servant whom he remembered to have seen in the Rue de l\u2019Universit\u00e9."}, {"size": 809, "text": "The man\u2019s dull face brightened as he perceived our hero, for Newman, for indefinable reasons, enjoyed the confidence of the liveried gentry.

Newman crossed the threshold of a room of superb proportions, which made him feel at first like a tourist with a guide-book and a cicerone awaiting a fee. But when his guide had left him alone, with the observation that he would call Madame la Comtesse, Newman perceived that the salon contained little that was remarkable save a dark ceiling with curiously carved rafters, some curtains of elaborate, antiquated tapestry, and a dark oaken floor, polished like a mirror."}, {"size": 723, "text": "He waited some minutes, walking up and down; but at length, as he turned at the end of the room, he saw that Madame de Cintr\u00e9 had come in by a distant door.

He was dismayed at the change in her appearance. Pale, heavy-browed, almost haggard with a sort of monastic rigidity in her dress, she had little but her pure features in common with the woman whose radiant good grace he had hitherto admired.

You do want a housekeeper, that you do; you want a tidy Englishwoman that isn\u2019t above taking hold of a broom.\u201d Newman assured her that he suspected, if he had not measured, his domestic abuses, and that to reform them was a mission worthy of her powers.

But he was terribly slow; it seemed as if we should never reach your blessed door. I am all of a tremble still; it took me five minutes, just now, to thread my needle.\u201d Newman told her, with a gleeful laugh, that if she chose she might have a little maid on purpose to thread her needles; and he went away murmuring to himself again that the old woman _was_ scared\u2014she _was_ scared!"}, {"size": 619, "text": "He had not shown Mrs. Tristram the little paper that he carried in his pocket-book, but since his return to Paris he had seen her several times, and she had told him that he seemed to her to be in a strange way\u2014an even stranger way than his sad situation made natural. Had his disappointment gone to his head? He looked like a man who was going to be ill, and yet she had never seen him more restless and active.

He might be melancholy if he would, or he might be stoical; he might be cross and cantankerous with her and ask her why she had ever dared to meddle with his destiny: to this she would submit; for this she would make allowances. Only, for Heaven\u2019s sake, let him not be incoherent. That would be extremely unpleasant. It was like people talking in their sleep; they always frightened her."}, {"size": 732, "text": "And Mrs. Tristram intimated that, taking very high ground as regards the moral obligation which events had laid upon her, she proposed not to rest quiet until she should have confronted him with the least inadequate substitute for Madame de Cintr\u00e9 that the two hemispheres contained. \u201cOh,\u201d said Newman, \u201cwe are even now, and we had better not open a new account!

The street in question, as some travelers will remember, adjoins the Parc Monceau, which is one of the prettiest corners of Paris. The quarter has an air of modern opulence and convenience which seems at variance with the ascetic institution, and the impression made upon Newman\u2019s gloomily-irritated gaze by the fresh-looking, windowless expanse behind which the woman he loved was perhaps even then pledging herself to pass the rest of her days was less exasperating than he had feared."}, {"size": 663, "text": "The place suggested a convent with the modern improvements\u2014an asylum in which privacy, though unbroken, might be not quite identical with privation, and meditation, though monotonous, might be of a cheerful cast. And yet he knew the case was otherwise; only at present it was not a reality to him. It was too strange and too mocking to be real; it was like a page torn out of a romance, with no context in his own experience. On Sunday morning, at the hour which Mrs. Tristram had indicated, he rang at the gate in the blank wall. It instantly opened and admitted him into a clean, cold-looking court, from beyond which a dull, plain edifice looked down upon him."}, {"size": 641, "text": "A robust lay sister with a cheerful complexion emerged from a porter\u2019s lodge, and, on his stating his errand, pointed to the open door of the chapel, an edifice which occupied the right side of the court and was preceded by the high flight of steps. Newman ascended the steps and immediately entered the open door. Service had not yet begun; the place was dimly lighted, and it was some moments before he could distinguish its features. Then he saw it was divided by a large close iron screen into two unequal portions. The altar was on the hither side of the screen, and between it and the entrance were disposed several benches and chairs."}, {"size": 615, "text": "Three or four of these were occupied by vague, motionless figures\u2014figures that he presently perceived to be women, deeply absorbed in their devotion. The place seemed to Newman very cold; the smell of the incense itself was cold. Besides this there was a twinkle of tapers and here and there a glow of colored glass. Newman seated himself; the praying women kept still, with their backs turned. He saw they were visitors like himself and he would have liked to see their faces; for he believed that they were the mourning mothers and sisters of other women who had had the same pitiless courage as Madame de Cintr\u00e9."}, {"size": 627, "text": "But they were better off than he, for they at least shared the faith to which the others had sacrificed themselves. Three or four persons came in; two of them were elderly gentlemen. Everyone was very quiet. Newman fastened his eyes upon the screen behind the altar. That was the convent, the real convent, the place where she was. But he could see nothing; no light came through the crevices. He got up and approached the partition very gently, trying to look through. But behind it there was darkness, with nothing stirring. He went back to his place, and after that a priest and two altar boys came in and began to say mass."}, {"size": 673, "text": "Newman watched their genuflections and gyrations with a grim, still enmity; they seemed aids and abettors of Madame de Cintr\u00e9\u2019s desertion; they were mouthing and droning out their triumph. The priest\u2019s long, dismal intonings acted upon his nerves and deepened his wrath; there was something defiant in his unintelligible drawl; it seemed meant for Newman himself. Suddenly there arose from the depths of the chapel, from behind the inexorable grating, a sound which drew his attention from the altar\u2014the sound of a strange, lugubrious chant, uttered by women\u2019s voices. It began softly, but it presently grew louder, and as it increased it became more of a wail and a dirge."}, {"size": 676, "text": "It was the chant of the Carmelite nuns, their only human utterance. It was their dirge over their buried affections and over the vanity of earthly desires. At first Newman was bewildered\u2014almost stunned\u2014by the strangeness of the sound; then, as he comprehended its meaning, he listened intently and his heart began to throb. He listened for Madame de Cintr\u00e9\u2019s voice, and in the very heart of the tuneless harmony he imagined he made it out. (We are obliged to believe that he was wrong, inasmuch as she had obviously not yet had time to become a member of the invisible sisterhood.) The chant kept on, mechanical and monotonous, with dismal repetitions and despairing cadences."}, {"size": 736, "text": "It was hideous, it was horrible; as it continued, Newman felt that he needed all his self-control. He was growing more agitated; he felt tears in his eyes. At last, as in its full force the thought came over him that this confused, impersonal wail was all that either he or the world she had deserted should ever hear of the voice he had found so sweet, he felt that he could bear it no longer. He rose abruptly and made his way out. On the threshold he paused, listened again to the dreary strain, and then hastily descended into the court. As he did so he saw the good sister with the high-colored cheeks and the fanlike frill to her coiffure, who had admitted him, was in conference at the gate with two persons who had just come in."}, {"size": 643, "text": "A second glance informed him that these persons were Madame de Bellegarde and her son, and that they were about to avail themselves of that method of approach to Madame de Cintr\u00e9 which Newman had found but a mockery of consolation. As he crossed the court M. de Bellegarde recognized him; the marquis was coming to the steps, leading his mother. The old lady also gave Newman a look, and it resembled that of her son. Both faces expressed a franker perturbation, something more akin to the humbleness of dismay, than Newman had yet seen in them. Evidently he startled the Bellegardes, and they had not their grand behavior immediately in hand."}, {"size": 670, "text": "Newman hurried past them, guided only by the desire to get out of the convent walls and into the street. The gate opened itself at his approach; he strode over the threshold and it closed behind him. A carriage which appeared to have been standing there, was just turning away from the sidewalk. Newman looked at it for a moment, blankly; then he became conscious, through the dusky mist that swam before his eyes, that a lady seated in it was bowing to him. The vehicle had turned away before he recognized her; it was an ancient landau with one half the cover lowered. The lady\u2019s bow was very positive and accompanied with a smile; a little girl was seated beside her."}, {"size": 664, "text": "He raised his hat, and then the lady bade the coachman stop. The carriage halted again beside the pavement, and she sat there and beckoned to Newman\u2014beckoned with the demonstrative grace of Madame Urbain de Bellegarde. Newman hesitated a moment before he obeyed her summons, during this moment he had time to curse his stupidity for letting the others escape him. He had been wondering how he could get at them; fool that he was for not stopping them then and there! What better place than beneath the very prison walls to which they had consigned the promise of his joy? He had been too bewildered to stop them, but now he felt ready to wait for them at the gate."}, {"size": 664, "text": "Madame Urbain, with a certain attractive petulance, beckoned to him again, and this time he went over to the carriage. She leaned out and gave him her hand, looking at him kindly, and smiling. \u201cAh, monsieur,\u201d she said, \u201cyou don\u2019t include me in your wrath? I had nothing to do with it.\u201d \u201cOh, I don\u2019t suppose _you_ could have prevented it!\u201d Newman answered in a tone which was not that of studied gallantry. \u201cWhat you say is too true for me to resent the small account it makes of my influence. I forgive you, at any rate, because you look as if you had seen a ghost.\u201d \u201cI have!\u201d said Newman. \u201cI am glad, then, I didn\u2019t go in with Madame de Bellegarde and my husband."}, {"size": 602, "text": "You must have seen them, eh? Was the meeting affectionate? Did you hear the chanting? They say it\u2019s like the lamentations of the damned. I wouldn\u2019t go in: one is certain to hear that soon enough. Poor Claire\u2014in a white shroud and a big brown cloak! That\u2019s the _toilette_ of the Carmelites, you know. Well, she was always fond of long, loose things. But I must not speak of her to you; only I must say that I am very sorry for you, that if I could have helped you I would, and that I think everyone has been very shabby.

We are not all like that. I am sorry I am not going to see you again; you know I think you very good company. I would prove it by asking you to get into the carriage and drive with me for a quarter of an hour, while I wait for my mother-in-law.

He hardly knew what Madame de Bellegarde was saying; he was only conscious that she was chattering ineffectively. But suddenly it occurred to him that, with her pretty professions, there was a way of making her effective; she might help him to get at the old woman and the marquis. \u201cThey are coming back soon\u2014your companions?\u201d he said. \u201cYou are waiting for them?\u201d \u201cThey will hear the mass out; there is nothing to keep them longer."}, {"size": 612, "text": "Claire has refused to see them.\u201d \u201cI want to speak to them,\u201d said Newman; \u201cand you can help me, you can do me a favor.

We are to wait for her in the park, where my husband is to bring her to us. Follow me now; just within the gates I shall get out of my carriage. Sit down on a chair in some quiet corner and I will bring them near you. There\u2019s devotion for you! _Le reste vous regarde_.\u201d This proposal seemed to Newman extremely felicitous; it revived his drooping spirit, and he reflected that Madame Urbain was not such a goose as she seemed.

He found Madame de Bellegarde promptly, seated in one of the quiet corners of which she had spoken, while before her, in the alley, her little girl, attended by the footman and the lap-dog, walked up and down as if she were taking a lesson in deportment. Newman sat down beside the mamma, and she talked a great deal, apparently with the design of convincing him that\u2014if he would only see it\u2014poor dear Claire did not belong to the most fascinating type of woman."}, {"size": 622, "text": "She was too tall and thin, too stiff and cold; her mouth was too wide and her nose too narrow.

She made a fresh series of _mots_, characterized with great felicity the Italian intellect and the taste of the figs at Sorrento, predicted the ultimate future of the Italian kingdom (disgust with the brutal Sardinian rule and complete reversion, throughout the peninsula, to the sacred sway of the Holy Father), and, finally, gave a history of the love affairs of the Princess X\u2014\u2014."}, {"size": 617, "text": "This narrative provoked some rectifications on the part of the prince, who, as he said, pretended to know something about that matter; and having satisfied himself that Newman was in no laughing mood, either with regard to the size of his head or anything else, he entered into the controversy with an animation for which the duchess, when she set him down as a bore, could not have been prepared.

He had a fancy of carrying out his life as he would have directed it if Madame de Cintr\u00e9 had been left to him\u2014of making it a religion to do nothing that she would have disliked. In this, certainly, there was no sacrifice; but there was a pale, oblique ray of inspiration. It would be lonely entertainment\u2014a good deal like a man talking to himself in the mirror for want of better company. Yet the idea yielded Newman several half hours\u2019 dumb exaltation as he sat, with his hands in his pockets and his legs stretched, over the relics of an expensively poor dinner, in the undying English twilight."}, {"size": 757, "text": "If, however, his commercial imagination was dead, he felt no contempt for the surviving actualities begotten by it. He was glad he had been prosperous and had been a great man of business rather than a small one; he was extremely glad he was rich. He felt no impulse to sell all he had and give to the poor, or to retire into meditative economy and asceticism. He was glad he was rich and tolerably young; if it was possible to think too much about buying and selling, it was a gain to have a good slice of life left in which not to think about them. Come, what should he think about now? Again and again Newman could think only of one thing; his thoughts always came back to it, and as they did so, with an emotional rush which seemed physically to express"}, {"size": 613, "text": "He remained in England till midsummer, and spent a month in the country, wandering about cathedrals, castles, and ruins. Several times, taking a walk from his inn into meadows and parks, he stopped by a well-worn stile, looked across through the early evening at a gray church tower, with its dusky nimbus of thick-circling swallows, and remembered that this might have been part of the entertainment of his honeymoon. He had never been so much alone or indulged so little in accidental dialogue. The period of recreation appointed by Mrs. Tristram had at last expired, and he asked himself what he should do now."}, {"size": 699, "text": "Mrs. Tristram had written to him, proposing to him that he should join her in the Pyrenees; but he was not in the humor to return to France. The simplest thing was to repair to Liverpool and embark on the first American steamer. Newman made his way to the great seaport and secured his berth; and the night before sailing he sat in his room at the hotel, staring down, vacantly and wearily, at an open portmanteau. A number of papers were lying upon it, which he had been meaning to look over; some of them might conveniently be destroyed. But at last he shuffled them roughly together, and pushed them into a corner of the valise; they were business papers, and he was in no humor for sifting them."}, {"size": 607, "text": "Then he drew forth his pocket-book and took out a paper of smaller size than those he had dismissed. He did not unfold it; he simply sat looking at the back of it. If he had momentarily entertained the idea of destroying it, the idea quickly expired. What the paper suggested was the feeling that lay in his innermost heart and that no reviving cheerfulness could long quench\u2014the feeling that after all and above all he was a good fellow wronged. With it came a hearty hope that the Bellegardes were enjoying their suspense as to what he would do yet. The more it was prolonged the more they would enjoy it!"}, {"size": 615, "text": "He had hung fire once, yes; perhaps, in his present queer state of mind, he might hang fire again. But he restored the little paper to his pocket-book very tenderly, and felt better for thinking of the suspense of the Bellegardes. He felt better every time he thought of it after that, as he sailed the summer seas. He landed in New York and journeyed across the continent to San Francisco, and nothing that he observed by the way contributed to mitigate his sense of being a good fellow wronged. He saw a great many other good fellows\u2014his old friends\u2014but he told none of them of the trick that had been played him."}, {"size": 629, "text": "He said simply that the lady he was to have married had changed her mind, and when he was asked if he had changed his own, he said, \u201cSuppose we change the subject.\u201d He told his friends that he had brought home no \u201cnew ideas\u201d from Europe, and his conduct probably struck them as an eloquent proof of failing invention. He took no interest in chatting about his affairs and manifested no desire to look over his accounts. He asked half a dozen questions which, like those of an eminent physician inquiring for particular symptoms, showed that he still knew what he was talking about; but he made no comments and gave no directions."}, {"size": 696, "text": "He not only puzzled the gentlemen on the stock exchange, but he was himself surprised at the extent of his indifference. As it seemed only to increase, he made an effort to combat it; he tried to interest himself and to take up his old occupations. But they appeared unreal to him; do what he would he somehow could not believe in them. Sometimes he began to fear that there was something the matter with his head; that his brain, perhaps, had softened, and that the end of his strong activities had come. This idea came back to him with an exasperating force. A hopeless, helpless loafer, useful to no one and detestable to himself\u2014this was what the treachery of the Bellegardes had made of him."}, {"size": 765, "text": "In his restless idleness he came back from San Francisco to New York, and sat for three days in the lobby of his hotel, looking out through a huge wall of plate-glass at the unceasing stream of pretty girls in Parisian-looking dresses, undulating past with little parcels nursed against their neat figures. At the end of three days he returned to San Francisco, and having arrived there he wished he had stayed away. He had nothing to do, his occupation was gone, and it seemed to him that he should never find it again. He had nothing to do _here_, he sometimes said to himself; but there was something beyond the ocean that he was still to do; something that he had left undone experimentally and speculatively, to see if it could content itself to remain undone."}, {"size": 743, "text": "But it was not content: it kept pulling at his heartstrings and thumping at his reason; it murmured in his ears and hovered perpetually before his eyes. It interposed between all new resolutions and their fulfillment; it seemed like a stubborn ghost, dumbly entreating to be laid. Till that was done he should never be able to do anything else. One day, toward the end of the winter, after a long interval, he received a letter from Mrs. Tristram, who apparently was animated by a charitable desire to amuse and distract her correspondent. She gave him much Paris gossip, talked of General Packard and Miss Kitty Upjohn, enumerated the new plays at the theatre, and enclosed a note from her husband, who had gone down to spend a month at Nice."}, {"size": 661, "text": "Then came her signature, and after this her postscript. The latter consisted of these few lines: \u201cI heard three days since from my friend, the Abb\u00e9 Aubert, that Madame de Cintr\u00e9 last week took the veil at the Carmelites. It was on her twenty-seventh birthday, and she took the name of her, patroness, St. Veronica. Sister Veronica has a lifetime before her!\u201d This letter came to Newman in the morning; in the evening he started for Paris. His wound began to ache with its first fierceness, and during his long bleak journey the thought of Madame de Cintr\u00e9\u2019s \u201clife-time,\u201d passed within prison walls on whose outer side he might stand, kept him perpetual company."}, {"size": 679, "text": "Now he would fix himself in Paris forever; he would extort a sort of happiness from the knowledge that if she was not there, at least the stony sepulchre that held her was. He descended, unannounced, upon Mrs. Bread, whom he found keeping lonely watch in his great empty saloons on the Boulevard Haussmann. They were as neat as a Dutch village, Mrs. Bread\u2019s only occupation had been removing individual dust-particles. She made no complaint, however, of her loneliness, for in her philosophy a servant was but a mysteriously projected machine, and it would be as fantastic for a housekeeper to comment upon a gentleman\u2019s absences as for a clock to remark upon not being wound up."}, {"size": 646, "text": "No particular clock, Mrs. Bread supposed, went all the time, and no particular servant could enjoy all the sunshine diffused by the career of an exacting master. She ventured, nevertheless, to express a modest hope that Newman meant to remain a while in Paris. Newman laid his hand on hers and shook it gently. \u201cI mean to remain forever,\u201d he said. He went after this to see Mrs. Tristram, to whom he had telegraphed, and who expected him. She looked at him a moment and shook her head. \u201cThis won\u2019t do,\u201d she said; \u201cyou have come back too soon.\u201d He sat down and asked about her husband and her children, tried even to inquire about Miss Dora Finch."}, {"size": 395, "text": "In the midst of this\u2014\u201cDo you know where she is?\u201d he asked, abruptly. Mrs. Tristram hesitated a moment; of course he couldn\u2019t mean Miss Dora Finch. Then she answered, properly: \u201cShe has gone to the other house\u2014in the Rue d\u2019Enfer.\u201d After Newman had sat a while longer looking very sombre, she went on: \u201cYou are not so good a man as I thought. You are more\u2014you are more\u2014\u201d \u201cMore what?\u201d Newman asked."}, {"size": 661, "text": "\u201cGood God!\u201d cried Newman; \u201cdo you expect me to forgive?\u201d \u201cNo, not that. I have forgiven, so of course you can\u2019t. But you might forget! You have a worse temper about it than I should have expected. You look wicked\u2014you look dangerous.\u201d \u201cI may be dangerous,\u201d he said; \u201cbut I am not wicked. No, I am not wicked.\u201d And he got up to go. Mrs. Tristram asked him to come back to dinner; but he answered that he did not feel like pledging himself to be present at an entertainment, even as a solitary guest. Later in the evening, if he should be able, he would come.He walked away through the city, beside the Seine and over it, and took the direction of the Rue d\u2019Enfer."}, {"size": 686, "text": "The day had the softness of early spring; but the weather was gray and humid. Newman found himself in a part of Paris which he little knew\u2014a region of convents and prisons, of streets bordered by long dead walls and traversed by a few wayfarers. At the intersection of two of these streets stood the house of the Carmelites\u2014a dull, plain edifice, with a high-shouldered blank wall all round it. From without Newman could see its upper windows, its steep roof and its chimneys. But these things revealed no symptoms of human life; the place looked dumb, deaf, inanimate. The pale, dead, discolored wall stretched beneath it, far down the empty side street\u2014a vista without a human figure."}, {"size": 645, "text": "Newman stood there a long time; there were no passers; he was free to gaze his fill. This seemed the goal of his journey; it was what he had come for. It was a strange satisfaction, and yet it was a satisfaction; the barren stillness of the place seemed to be his own release from ineffectual longing. It told him that the woman within was lost beyond recall, and that the days and years of the future would pile themselves above her like the huge immovable slab of a tomb. These days and years, in this place, would always be just so gray and silent. Suddenly, from the thought of their seeing him stand there, again the charm utterly departed."}, {"size": 681, "text": "He would never stand there again; it was gratuitous dreariness. He turned away with a heavy heart, but with a heart lighter than the one he had brought. Everything was over, and he too at last could rest. He walked down through narrow, winding streets to the edge of the Seine again, and there he saw, close above him, the soft, vast towers of Notre Dame. He crossed one of the bridges and stood a moment in the empty place before the great cathedral; then he went in beneath the grossly-imaged portals. He wandered some distance up the nave and sat down in the splendid dimness. He sat a long time; he heard far-away bells chiming off, at long intervals, to the rest of the world."}, {"size": 625, "text": "He was very tired; this was the best place he could be in. He said no prayers; he had no prayers to say. He had nothing to be thankful for, and he had nothing to ask; nothing to ask, because now he must take care of himself. But a great cathedral offers a very various hospitality, and Newman sat in his place, because while he was there he was out of the world. The most unpleasant thing that had ever happened to him had reached its formal conclusion, as it were; he could close the book and put it away. He leaned his head for a long time on the chair in front of him; when he took it up he felt that he was himself again."}, {"size": 620, "text": "Somewhere in his mind, a tight knot seemed to have loosened. He thought of the Bellegardes; he had almost forgotten them. He remembered them as people he had meant to do something to. He gave a groan as he remembered what he had meant to do; he was annoyed at having meant to do it; the bottom, suddenly, had fallen out of his revenge. Whether it was Christian charity or unregenerate good nature\u2014what it was, in the background of his soul\u2014I don\u2019t pretend to say; but Newman\u2019s last thought was that of course he would let the Bellegardes go. If he had spoken it aloud he would have said that he didn\u2019t want to hurt them."}, {"size": 683, "text": "He was ashamed of having wanted to hurt them. They had hurt him, but such things were really not his game. At last he got up and came out of the darkening church; not with the elastic step of a man who had won a victory or taken a resolve, but strolling soberly, like a good-natured man who is still a little ashamed. Going home, he said to Mrs. Bread that he must trouble her to put back his things into the portmanteau she had unpacked the evening before. His gentle stewardess looked at him through eyes a trifle bedimmed. \u201cDear me, sir,\u201d she exclaimed, \u201cI thought you said that you were going to stay forever.\u201d \u201cI meant that I was going to stay away forever,\u201d said Newman kindly."}, {"size": 666, "text": "And since his departure from Paris on the following day he has certainly not returned. The gilded apartments I have so often spoken of stand ready to receive him; but they serve only as a spacious residence for Mrs. Bread, who wanders eternally from room to room, adjusting the tassels of the curtains, and keeps her wages, which are regularly brought her by a banker\u2019s clerk, in a great pink S\u00e8vres vase on the drawing-room mantelshelf. Late in the evening Newman went to Mrs. Tristram\u2019s and found Tom Tristram by the domestic fireside. \u201cI\u2019m glad to see you back in Paris,\u201d this gentleman declared. \u201cYou know it\u2019s really the only place for a white man to live.\u201d Mr."}, {"size": 614, "text": "Tristram made his friend welcome, according to his own rosy light, and offered him a convenient _r\u00e9sum\u00e9_ of the Franco-American gossip of the last six months. Then at last he got up and said he would go for half an hour to the club. \u201cI suppose a man who has been for six months in California wants a little intellectual conversation. I\u2019ll let my wife have a go at you.\u201d Newman shook hands heartily with his host, but did not ask him to remain; and then he relapsed into his place on the sofa, opposite to Mrs. Tristram. She presently asked him what he had done after leaving her. \u201cNothing particular,\u201d said Newman."}, {"size": 602, "text": "\u201cYou struck me,\u201d she rejoined, \u201cas a man with a plot in his head. You looked as if you were bent on some sinister errand, and after you had left me I wondered whether I ought to have let you go.\u201d \u201cI only went over to the other side of the river\u2014to the Carmelites,\u201d said Newman. Mrs. Tristram looked at him a moment and smiled. \u201cWhat did you do there? Try to scale the wall?\u201d \u201cI did nothing. I looked at the place for a few minutes and then came away.\u201d Mrs. Tristram gave him a sympathetic glance. \u201cYou didn\u2019t happen to meet M. de Bellegarde,\u201d she asked, \u201cstaring hopelessly at the convent wall as well?"}, {"size": 719, "text": "I am told he takes his sister\u2019s conduct very hard.\u201d \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t meet him, I am happy to say,\u201d Newman answered, after a pause. \u201cThey are in the country,\u201d Mrs. Tristram went on; \u201cat\u2014what is the name of the place?\u2014Fleuri\u00e8res. They returned there at the time you left Paris and have been spending the year in extreme seclusion. The little marquise must enjoy it; I expect to hear that she has eloped with her daughter\u2019s music-master!\u201d Newman was looking at the light wood-fire; but he listened to this with extreme interest. At last he spoke: \u201cI mean never to mention the name of those people again, and I don\u2019t want to hear anything more about them.\u201d And then he took out his pocket-book and drew forth a scrap of paper."}, {"size": 702, "text": "He looked at it an instant, then got up and stood by the fire. \u201cI am going to burn them up,\u201d he said. \u201cI am glad to have you as a witness. There they go!\u201d And he tossed the paper into the flame. Mrs. Tristram sat with her embroidery needle suspended. \u201cWhat is that paper?\u201d she asked. Newman leaning against the fireplace, stretched his arms and drew a longer breath than usual. Then after a moment, \u201cI can tell you now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a paper containing a secret of the Bellegardes\u2014something which would damn them if it were known.\u201d Mrs. Tristram dropped her embroidery with a reproachful moan. \u201cAh, why didn\u2019t you show it to me?\u201d \u201cI thought of showing it to you\u2014I thought of showing it to everyone."}, {"size": 283, "text": "I thought of paying my debt to the Bellegardes that way. So I told them, and I frightened them. They have been staying in the country as you tell me, to keep out of the explosion. But I have given it up.\u201d Mrs. Tristram began to take slow stitches again. \u201cHave you quite given it up?\u201d"}, {"size": 620, "text": "\u201cIs it very bad, this secret?\u201d \u201cFor myself,\u201d said Mrs. Tristram, \u201cI am sorry you have given it up. I should have liked immensely to see your paper. They have wronged me too, you know, as your sponsor and guarantee, and it would have served for my revenge as well. How did you come into possession of your secret?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a long story. But honestly, at any rate.\u201d \u201cAnd they knew you were master of it?\u201d \u201cDear me, how interesting!\u201d cried Mrs. Tristram. \u201cAnd you humbled them at your feet?\u201d Newman was silent a moment. \u201cNo, not at all. They pretended not to care\u2014not to be afraid. But I know they did care\u2014they were afraid.\u201d"}, {"size": 619, "text": "Newman stared a moment. \u201cYes, I\u2019m sure.\u201d Mrs. Tristram resumed her slow stitches. \u201cThey defied you, eh?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Newman, \u201cit was about that.\u201d \u201cYou tried by the threat of exposure to make them retract?\u201d Mrs. Tristram pursued. \u201cYes, but they wouldn\u2019t. I gave them their choice, and they chose to take their chance of bluffing off the charge and convicting me of fraud. But they _were_ frightened,\u201d Newman added, \u201cand I have had all the vengeance I want.\u201d \u201cIt is most provoking,\u201d said Mrs. Tristram, \u201cto hear you talk of the \u2018charge\u2019 when the charge is burnt up.

My impression would be that since, as you say, they defied you, it was because they believed that, after all, you would never really come to the point. Their confidence, after counsel taken of each other, was not in their innocence, nor in their talent for bluffing things off; it was in your remarkable good nature! You see they were right.\u201d Newman instinctively turned to see if the little paper was in fact consumed; but there was nothing left of it."}]}
