A SOUTH SEA BRIDAL.I saw that island first when it was neither night nor morning. The moon was to the west, setting, but still broad and bright. To the east, and right amidships of the dawn, which was all pink, the daystar sparkled like a diamond. The land breeze blew in our faces, and smelt strong of wild lime and vanilla: other things besides, but these were the most plain; and the chill of it set me sneezing."}, {"size": 754, "text": "I should say I had been for years on a low island near the line, living for the most part solitary among natives. Here was a fresh experience: even the tongue would be quite strange to me; and the look of these woods and mountains, and the rare smell of them, renewed my blood. The captain blew out the binnacle lamp. \u201cThere!\u201d said he, \u201cthere goes a bit of smoke, Mr. Wiltshire, behind the break of the reef. That\u2019s Fales\u00e1, where your station is, the last village to the east; nobody lives to windward\u2014I don\u2019t know why. Take my glass, and you can make the houses out.\u201d I took the glass; and the shores leaped nearer, and I saw the tangle of the woods and the breach of the surf, and the brown roofs and the black insides of houses peeped among the trees."}, {"size": 638, "text": "\u201cDo you catch a bit of white there to the east\u2019ard?\u201d the captain continued. \u201cThat\u2019s your house. Coral built, stands high, verandah you could walk on three abreast; best station in the South Pacific. When old Adams saw it, he took and shook me by the hand. \u2018I\u2019ve dropped into a soft thing here,\u2019 says he.\u2014\u2018So you have,\u2019 says I, \u2018and time too!\u2019 Poor Johnny! I never saw him again but the once, and then he had changed his tune\u2014couldn\u2019t get on with the natives, or the whites, or something; and the next time we came round there he was dead and buried. I took and put up a bit of a stick to him: \u2018John Adams, _obit_ eighteen and sixty-eight."}, {"size": 641, "text": "Go thou and do likewise.\u2019 I missed that man. I never could see much harm in Johnny.\u201d \u201cWhat did he die of?\u201d I inquired. \u201cSome kind of sickness,\u201d says the captain. \u201cIt appears it took him sudden. Seems he got up in the night, and filled up on Pain-Killer and Kennedy\u2019s Discovery. No go: he was booked beyond Kennedy. Then he had tried to open a case of gin. No go again: not strong enough. Then he must have turned to and run out on the verandah, and capsized over the rail. When they found him, the next day, he was clean crazy\u2014carried on all the time about somebody watering his copra. Poor John!\u201d \u201cWas it thought to be the island?\u201d I asked."}, {"size": 601, "text": "\u201cWell, it was thought to be the island, or the trouble, or something,\u201d he replied. \u201cI never could hear but what it was a healthy place. Our last man, Vigours, never turned a hair. He left because of the beach\u2014said he was afraid of Black Jack and Case and Whistling Jimmie, who was still alive at the time, but got drowned soon afterward when drunk. As for old Captain Randall, he\u2019s been here any time since eighteen-forty, forty-five. I never could see much harm in Billy, nor much change. Seems as if he might live to be Old Kafoozleum. No, I guess it\u2019s healthy.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a boat coming now,\u201d said I."}, {"size": 638, "text": "\u201cShe\u2019s right in the pass; looks to be a sixteen-foot whale; two white men in the stern sheets.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the boat that drowned Whistling Jimmie!\u201d cried the Captain; \u201clet\u2019s see the glass. Yes, that\u2019s Case, sure enough, and the darkie. They\u2019ve got a gallows bad reputation, but you know what a place the beach is for talking. My belief, that Whistling Jimmie was the worst of the trouble; and he\u2019s gone to glory, you see. What\u2019ll you bet they ain\u2019t after gin? Lay you five to two they take six cases.\u201d When these two traders came aboard I was pleased with the looks of them at once, or, rather, with the looks of both, and the speech of one."}, {"size": 714, "text": "I was sick for white neighbours after my four years at the line, which I always counted years of prison; getting tabooed, and going down to the Speak House to see and get it taken off; buying gin and going on a break, and then repenting; sitting in the house at night with the lamp for company; or walking on the beach and wondering what kind of a fool to call myself for being where I was. There were no other whites upon my island, and when I sailed to the next, rough customers made the most of the society. Now to see these two when they came aboard was a pleasure. One was a negro, to be sure; but they were both rigged out smart in striped pyjamas and straw hats, and Case would have passed muster in a city."}, {"size": 710, "text": "He was yellow and smallish, had a hawk\u2019s nose to his face, pale eyes, and his beard trimmed with scissors. No man knew his country, beyond he was of English speech; and it was clear he came of a good family and was splendidly educated. He was accomplished too; played the accordion first-rate; and give him a piece of string or a cork or a pack of cards, and he could show you tricks equal to any professional. He could speak, when he chose, fit for a drawing-room; and when he chose he could blaspheme worse than a Yankee boatswain, and talk smart to sicken a Kanaka. The way he thought would pay best at the moment, that was Case\u2019s way, and it always seemed to come natural, and like as if he was born to it."}, {"size": 621, "text": "He had the courage of a lion and the cunning of a rat; and if he\u2019s not in hell to-day, there\u2019s no such place. I know but one good point to the man: that he was fond of his wife, and kind to her. She was a Samoa woman, and dyed her hair red, Samoa style; and when he came to die (as I have to tell of) they found one strange thing\u2014that he had made a will, like a Christian, and the widow got the lot: all his, they said, and all Black Jack\u2019s, and the most of Billy Randall\u2019s in the bargain, for it was Case that kept the books. So she went off home in the schooner _Manu\u2019a_, and does the lady to this day in her own place."}, {"size": 645, "text": "But of all this on that first morning I knew no more than a fly. Case used me like a gentleman and like a friend, made me welcome to Fales\u00e1, and put his services at my disposal, which was the more helpful from my ignorance of the native. All the better part of the day we sat drinking better acquaintance in the cabin, and I never heard a man talk more to the point. There was no smarter trader, and none dodgier, in the islands. I thought Fales\u00e1 seemed to be the right kind of a place; and the more I drank the lighter my heart. Our last trader had fled the place at half an hour\u2019s notice, taking a chance passage in a labour ship from up west."}, {"size": 889, "text": "The captain, when he came, had found the station closed, the keys left with the native pastor, and a letter from the runaway, confessing he was fairly frightened of his life. Since then the firm had not been represented, and of course there was no cargo. The wind, besides, was fair, the captain hoped he could make his next island by dawn, with a good tide, and the business of landing my trade was gone about lively. There was no call for me to fool with it, Case said; nobody would touch my things, everyone was honest in Fales\u00e1, only about chickens or an odd knife or an odd stick of tobacco; and the best I could do was to sit quiet till the vessel left, then come straight to his house, see old Captain Randall, the father of the beach, take pot-luck, and go home to sleep when it got dark. So it was high noon, and the schooner was under way before I set my foot on shore at Fales\u00e1."}, {"size": 675, "text": "I had a glass or two on board; I was just off a long cruise, and the ground heaved under me like a ship\u2019s deck. The world was like all new painted; my foot went along to music; Fales\u00e1 might have been Fiddler\u2019s Green, if there is such a place, and more\u2019s the pity if there isn\u2019t! It was good to foot the grass, to look aloft at the green mountains, to see the men with their green wreaths and the women in their bright dresses, red and blue. On we went, in the strong sun and the cool shadow, liking both; and all the children in the town came trotting after with their shaven heads and their brown bodies, and raising a thin kind of a cheer in our wake, like crowing poultry."}, {"size": 737, "text": "\u201cBy-the-bye,\u201d says Case, \u201cwe must get you a wife.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s so,\u201d said I; \u201cI had forgotten.\u201d There was a crowd of girls about us, and I pulled myself up and looked among them like a Bashaw. They were all dressed out for the sake of the ship being in; and the women of Fales\u00e1 are a handsome lot to see. If they have a fault, they are a trifle broad in the beam; and I was just thinking so when Case touched me. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty,\u201d says he. I saw one coming on the other side alone. She had been fishing; all she wore was a chemise, and it was wetted through. She was young and very slender for an island maid, with a long face, a high forehead, and a shy, strange, blindish look, between a cat\u2019s and a baby\u2019s. \u201cWho\u2019s she?\u201d said I. \u201cShe\u2019ll do.\u201d"}, {"size": 662, "text": "\u201cThat\u2019s Uma,\u201d said Case, and he called her up and spoke to her in the native. I didn\u2019t know what he said; but when he was in the midst she looked up at me quick and timid, like a child dodging a blow, then down again, and presently smiled. She had a wide mouth, the lips and the chin cut like any statue\u2019s; and the smile came out for a moment and was gone. Then she stood with her head bent, and heard Case to an end, spoke back in the pretty Polynesian voice, looking him full in the face, heard him again in answer, and then with an obeisance started off. I had just a share of the bow, but never another shot of her eye, and there was no more word of smiling."}, {"size": 649, "text": "\u201cI guess it\u2019s all right,\u201d said Case. \u201cI guess you can have her. I\u2019ll make it square with the old lady. You can have your pick of the lot for a plug of tobacco,\u201d he added, sneering. I suppose it was the smile stuck in my memory, for I spoke back sharp. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t look that sort,\u201d I cried. \u201cI don\u2019t know that she is,\u201d said Case. \u201cI believe she\u2019s as right as the mail. Keeps to herself, don\u2019t go round with the gang, and that. O no, don\u2019t you misunderstand me\u2014Uma\u2019s on the square.\u201d He spoke eager, I thought, and that surprised and pleased me. \u201cIndeed,\u201d he went on, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t make so sure of getting her, only she cottoned to the cut of your jib."}, {"size": 787, "text": "All you have to do is to keep dark and let me work the mother my own way; and I\u2019ll bring the girl round to the captain\u2019s for the marriage.\u201d I didn\u2019t care for the word marriage, and I said so. \u201cOh, there\u2019s nothing to hurt in the marriage,\u201d says he. \u201cBlack Jack\u2019s the chaplain.\u201d By this time we had come in view of the house of these three white men; for a negro is counted a white man, and so is a Chinese! a strange idea, but common in the islands. It was a board house with a strip of rickety verandah. The store was to the front, with a counter, scales, and the poorest possible display of trade: a case or two of tinned meats; a barrel of hard bread; a few bolts of cotton stuff, not to be compared with mine; the only thing well represented being the contraband, firearms and liquor."}, {"size": 779, "text": "\u201cIf these are my only rivals,\u201d thinks I, \u201cI should do well in Fales\u00e1.\u201d Indeed, there was only the one way they could touch me, and that was with the guns and drink. In the back room was old Captain Randall, squatting on the floor native fashion, fat and pale, naked to the waist, grey as a badger, and his eyes set with drink. His body was covered with grey hair and crawled over by flies; one was in the corner of his eye\u2014he never heeded; and the mosquitoes hummed about the man like bees. Any clean-minded man would have had the creature out at once and buried him; and to see him, and think he was seventy, and remember he had once commanded a ship, and come ashore in his smart togs, and talked big in bars and consulates, and sat in club verandahs, turned me sick and sober."}, {"size": 599, "text": "He tried to get up when I came in, but that was hopeless; so he reached me a hand instead, and stumbled out some salutation. \u201cPapa\u2019s {1} pretty full this morning,\u201d observed Case. \u201cWe\u2019ve had an epidemic here; and Captain Randall takes gin for a prophylactic\u2014don\u2019t you, Papa?\u201d \u201cNever took such a thing in my life!\u201d cried the captain indignantly. \u201cTake gin for my health\u2019s sake, Mr. Wha\u2019s-ever-your-name\u2014\u2019s a precautionary measure.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s all right, Papa,\u201d said Case. \u201cBut you\u2019ll have to brace up. There\u2019s going to be a marriage\u2014Mr. Wiltshire here is going to get spliced.\u201d The old man asked to whom."}, {"size": 741, "text": "\u201cUma!\u201d cried the captain. \u201cWha\u2019s he want Uma for? \u2019s he come here for his health, anyway? Wha\u2019 \u2019n hell\u2019s he want Uma for?\u201d \u201cDry up, Papa,\u201d said Case. \u201c\u2019Tain\u2019t you that\u2019s to marry her. I guess you\u2019re not her godfather and godmother. I guess Mr. Wiltshire\u2019s going to please himself.\u201d With that he made an excuse to me that he must move about the marriage, and left me alone with the poor wretch that was his partner and (to speak truth) his gull. Trade and station belonged both to Randall; Case and the negro were parasites; they crawled and fed upon him like the flies, he none the wiser. Indeed, I have no harm to say of Billy Randall beyond the fact that my gorge rose at him, and the time I now passed in his company was like a nightmare."}, {"size": 885, "text": "The room was stifling hot and full of flies; for the house was dirty and low and small, and stood in a bad place, behind the village, in the borders of the bush, and sheltered from the trade. The three men\u2019s beds were on the floor, and a litter of pans and dishes. There was no standing furniture; Randall, when he was violent, tearing it to laths. There I sat and had a meal which was served us by Case\u2019s wife; and there I was entertained all day by that remains of man, his tongue stumbling among low old jokes and long old stories, and his own wheezy laughter always ready, so that he had no sense of my depression. He was nipping gin all the while. Sometimes he fell asleep, and awoke again, whimpering and shivering, and every now and again he would ask me why I wanted to marry Uma. \u201cMy friend,\u201d I was telling myself all day, \u201cyou must not come to be an old gentleman like this.\u201d"}, {"size": 691, "text": "It might be four in the afternoon, perhaps, when the back door was thrust slowly open, and a strange old native woman crawled into the house almost on her belly. She was swathed in black stuff to her heels; her hair was grey in swatches; her face was tattooed, which was not the practice in that island; her eyes big and bright and crazy. These she fixed upon me with a rapt expression that I saw to be part acting. She said no plain word, but smacked and mumbled with her lips, and hummed aloud, like a child over its Christmas pudding. She came straight across the house, heading for me, and, as soon as she was alongside, caught up my hand and purred and crooned over it like a great cat."}, {"size": 635, "text": "From this she slipped into a kind of song. \u201cWho the devil\u2019s this?\u201d cried I, for the thing startled me. \u201cIt\u2019s Fa\u2019avao,\u201d says Randall; and I saw he had hitched along the floor into the farthest corner. \u201cYou ain\u2019t afraid of her?\u201d I cried. \u201cMe \u2019fraid!\u201d cried the captain. \u201cMy dear friend, I defy her! I don\u2019t let her put her foot in here, only I suppose \u2019s different to-day, for the marriage. \u2019s Uma\u2019s mother.\u201d \u201cWell, suppose it is; what\u2019s she carrying on about?\u201d I asked, more irritated, perhaps more frightened, than I cared to show; and the captain told me she was making up a quantity of poetry in my praise because I was to marry Uma."}, {"size": 606, "text": "\u201cAll right, old lady,\u201d says I, with rather a failure of a laugh, \u201canything to oblige. But when you\u2019re done with my hand, you might let me know.\u201d She did as though she understood; the song rose into a cry, and stopped; the woman crouched out of the house the same way that she came in, and must have plunged straight into the bush, for when I followed her to the door she had already vanished. \u201cThese are rum manners,\u201d said I. \u201c\u2019s a rum crowd,\u201d said the captain, and, to my surprise, he made the sign of the cross on his bare bosom. \u201cHillo!\u201d says I, \u201care you a Papist?\u201d He repudiated the idea with contempt."}, {"size": 772, "text": "\u201cHard-shell Baptis\u2019,\u201d said he. \u201cBut, my dear friend, the Papists got some good ideas too; and tha\u2019 \u2019s one of \u2019em. You take my advice, and whenever you come across Uma or Fa\u2019avao or Vigours, or any of that crowd, you take a leaf out o\u2019 the priests, and do what I do. Savvy?\u201d says he, repeated the sign, and winked his dim eye at me. \u201cNo, _sir_!\u201d he broke out again, \u201cno Papists here!\u201d and for a long time entertained me with his religious opinions. I must have been taken with Uma from the first, or I should certainly have fled from that house, and got into the clean air, and the clean sea, or some convenient river\u2014though, it\u2019s true, I was committed to Case; and, besides, I could never have held my head up in that island if I had run from a girl upon my wedding-night."}, {"size": 790, "text": "The sun was down, the sky all on fire, and the lamp had been some time lighted, when Case came back with Uma and the negro. She was dressed and scented; her kilt was of fine tapa, looking richer in the folds than any silk; her bust, which was of the colour of dark honey, she wore bare only for some half a dozen necklaces of seeds and flowers; and behind her ears and in her hair she had the scarlet flowers of the hibiscus. She showed the best bearing for a bride conceivable, serious and still; and I thought shame to stand up with her in that mean house and before that grinning negro. I thought shame, I say; for the mountebank was dressed with a big paper collar, the book he made believe to read from was an odd volume of a novel, and the words of his service not fit to be set down."}, {"size": 610, "text": "My conscience smote me when we joined hands; and when she got her certificate I was tempted to throw up the bargain and confess. Here is the document. It was Case that wrote it, signatures and all, in a leaf out of the ledger:\u2014 This is to certify that Uma, daughter of Fa\u2019avao of Fales\u00e1, Island of ---, is illegally married to Mr. John Wiltshire for one week, and Mr. John Wiltshire is at liberty to send her to hell when he pleases. JOHN BLACKAMOAR. Chaplain to the hulks. Extracted from the Register by William T. Randall, Master Mariner. A nice paper to put in a girl\u2019s hand and see her hide away like gold."}, {"size": 676, "text": "A man might easily feel cheap for less. But it was the practice in these parts, and (as I told myself) not the least the fault of us white men, but of the missionaries. If they had let the natives be, I had never needed this deception, but taken all the wives I wished, and left them when I pleased, with a clear conscience. The more ashamed I was, the more hurry I was in to be gone; and our desires thus jumping together, I made the less remark of a change in the traders. Case had been all eagerness to keep me; now, as though he had attained a purpose, he seemed all eagerness to have me go. Uma, he said, could show me to my house, and the three bade us farewell indoors."}, {"size": 836, "text": "The night was nearly come; the village smelt of trees and flowers and the sea and bread-fruit-cooking; there came a fine roll of sea from the reef, and from a distance, among the woods and houses, many pretty sounds of men and children. It did me good to breathe free air; it did me good to be done with the captain and see, instead, the creature at my side. I felt for all the world as though she were some girl at home in the Old Country, and, forgetting myself for the minute, took her hand to walk with. Her fingers nestled into mine, I heard her breathe deep and quick, and all at once she caught my hand to her face and pressed it there. \u201cYou good!\u201d she cried, and ran ahead of me, and stopped and looked back and smiled, and ran ahead of me again, thus guiding me through the edge of the bush, and by a quiet way to my own house."}, {"size": 839, "text": "The truth is, Case had done the courting for me in style\u2014told her I was mad to have her, and cared nothing for the consequence; and the poor soul, knowing that which I was still ignorant of, believed it, every word, and had her head nigh turned with vanity and gratitude. Now, of all this I had no guess; I was one of those most opposed to any nonsense about native women, having seen so many whites eaten up by their wives\u2019 relatives, and made fools of in the bargain; and I told myself I must make a stand at once, and bring her to her bearings. But she looked so quaint and pretty as she ran away and then awaited me, and the thing was done so like a child or a kind dog, that the best I could do was just to follow her whenever she went on, to listen for the fall of her bare feet, and to watch in the dusk for the shining of her body."}, {"size": 648, "text": "And there was another thought came in my head. She played kitten with me now when we were alone; but in the house she had carried it the way a countess might, so proud and humble. And what with her dress\u2014for all there was so little of it, and that native enough\u2014what with her fine tapa and fine scents, and her red flowers and seeds, that were quite as bright as jewels, only larger\u2014it came over me she was a kind of countess really, dressed to hear great singers at a concert, and no even mate for a poor trader like myself. She was the first in the house; and while I was still without I saw a match flash and the lamplight kindle in the windows."}, {"size": 694, "text": "The station was a wonderful fine place, coral built, with quite a wide verandah, and the main room high and wide. My chests and cases had been piled in, and made rather of a mess; and there, in the thick of the confusion, stood Uma by the table, awaiting me. Her shadow went all the way up behind her into the hollow of the iron roof; she stood against it bright, the lamplight shining on her skin. I stopped in the door, and she looked at me, not speaking, with eyes that were eager and yet daunted; then she touched herself on the bosom. \u201cMe\u2014your wifie,\u201d she said. It had never taken me like that before; but the want of her took and shook all through me, like the wind in the luff of a sail."}, {"size": 644, "text": "I could not speak if I had wanted; and if I could, I would not. I was ashamed to be so much moved about a native, ashamed of the marriage too, and the certificate she had treasured in her kilt; and I turned aside and made believe to rummage among my cases. The first thing I lighted on was a case of gin, the only one that I had brought; and, partly for the girl\u2019s sake, and partly for horror of the recollections of old Randall, took a sudden resolve. I prized the lid off. One by one I drew the bottles with a pocket corkscrew, and sent Uma out to pour the stuff from the verandah. She came back after the last, and looked at me puzzled like."}, {"size": 763, "text": "\u201cNo good,\u201d said I, for I was now a little better master of my tongue. \u201cMan he drink, he no good.\u201d She agreed with this, but kept considering. \u201cWhy you bring him?\u201d she asked presently. \u201cSuppose you no want drink, you no bring him, I think.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d said I. \u201cOne time I want drink too much; now no want. You see, I no savvy I get one little wifie. Suppose I drink gin, my little wifie he \u2019fraid.\u201d To speak to her kindly was about more than I was fit for; I had made my vow I would never let on to weakness with a native, and I had nothing for it but to stop. She stood looking gravely down at me where I sat by the open case. \u201cI think you good man,\u201d she said. And suddenly she had fallen before me on the floor. \u201cI belong you all-e-same pig!\u201d she cried."}, {"size": 693, "text": "I came on the verandah just before the sun rose on the morrow. My house was the last on the east; there was a cape of woods and cliffs behind that hid the sunrise. To the west, a swift cold river ran down, and beyond was the green of the village, dotted with cocoa-palms and breadfruits and houses. The shutters were some of them down and some open; I saw the mosquito bars still stretched, with shadows of people new-awakened sitting up inside; and all over the green others were stalking silent, wrapped in their many-coloured sleeping clothes like Bedouins in Bible pictures. It was mortal still and solemn and chilly, and the light of the dawn on the lagoon was like the shining of a fire."}, {"size": 665, "text": "But the thing that troubled me was nearer hand. Some dozen young men and children made a piece of a half-circle, flanking my house: the river divided them, some were on the near side, some on the far, and one on a boulder in the midst; and they all sat silent, wrapped in their sheets, and stared at me and my house as straight as pointer dogs.

The beginning of the desert was marked off by a wall, to call it so, for it was more of a long mound of stones.

The ground where there was no underwood looked to be a heap of boulders. I saw many green pigeons which I might have shot, only I was there with a different idea.

As I got near the top of the hill, for the ground of the wood goes up in this place steep as a ladder, the wind began to sound straight on, and the leaves to toss and switch open and let in the sun. This suited me better; it was the same noise all the time, and nothing to startle. Well, I had got to a place where there was an underwood of what they call wild cocoanut\u2014mighty pretty with its scarlet fruit\u2014when there came a sound of singing in the wind that I thought I had never heard the like of."}, {"size": 609, "text": "It was all very fine to tell myself it was the branches; I knew better.

I tell you the truth: I had made up my mind to see an _aitu_; and if the thing had looked like a pig or a woman, it wouldn\u2019t have given me the same turn. The trouble was that it seemed kind of square, and the idea of a square thing that was alive and sang knocked me sick and silly.

Let\u2019s have my fun for my money.\u201d But I thought I might as well take the off chance of a prayer being any good; so I plumped on my knees and prayed out loud; and all the time I was praying the strange sounds came out of the tree, and went up and down, and changed, for all the world like music, only you could see it wasn\u2019t human\u2014there was nothing there that you could whistle.

From all this crowd and kind of vegetation, I was just thinking to myself, the place might have once been cleared, when I came on my nose over a pile of stones, and saw in a moment it was some kind of a work of man. The Lord knows when it was made or when deserted, for this part of the island has lain undisturbed since long before the whites came."}, {"size": 791, "text": "A few steps beyond I hit into the path I had been always looking for.

It seems, indeed, it was a piece of fashionable boldness to venture up here with the trader, and a young man scarce reckoned himself grown till he had got his breech tattooed, for one thing, and seen Case\u2019s devils for another. This is mighty like Kanakas; but, if you look at it another way, it\u2019s mighty like white folks too. A bit along the path I was brought to a clear stand, and had to rub my eyes. There was a wall in front of me, the path passing it by a gap; it was tumbledown and plainly very old, but built of big stones very well laid; and there is no native alive to-day upon that island that could dream of such a piece of building."}, {"size": 711, "text": "Along all the top of it was a line of queer figures, idols or scarecrows, or what not.

There are islands up west where they make these kind of figures till to-day; but if ever they were made in this island, the practice and the very recollection of it are now long forgotten. And the singular thing was that all these bogies were as fresh as toys out of a shop.

But I should tell you (what made the thing more curious) that all the time the Tyrolean harps were harping round me in the trees, and even while I looked, a green-and-yellow bird (that, I suppose, was building) began to tear the hair off the head of one of the figures. A little farther on I found the best curiosity of the museum. The first I saw of it was a longish mound of earth with a twist to it.

But the ashes of the fires were cold and the rains had washed them away; and the winds had blown, and some of the huts were overthrown. It was here he took his dwelling, and he made a fire drill, and a shell hook, and fished and cooked his fish, and climbed after green cocoanuts, the juice of which he drank, for in all the isle there was no water.

So he had sailed all this way, and might as well have stayed in Molokai; and had left home and wife and all his friends for no other cause but to escape his enemy, and the place he had come to was that wizard\u2019s hunting ground, and the shore where he walked invisible.

It seems, when the ship came, it was the beginning of the sickly season in that isle, when the fish of the lagoon are poisonous, and all who eat of them swell up and die. The mate was told of it; he saw the boats preparing, because in that season the people leave that island and sail to the Isle of Voices; but he was a fool of a white man, who would believe no stories but his own, and he caught one of these fish, cooked it and ate it, and swelled up and died, which was good news to Keola."}, {"size": 769, "text": "As for the Isle of Voices, it lay solitary the most part of the year; only now and then a boat\u2019s crew came for copra, and in the bad season, when the fish at the main isle were poisonous, the tribe dwelt there in a body.

Keola asked them if it were the same in their own island where they stayed, and they told him no, not there; nor yet in any other of some hundred isles that lay all about them in that sea; but it was a thing peculiar to the Isle of Voices."}, {"size": 631, "text": "They told him also that these fires and voices were ever on the seaside and in the seaward fringes of the wood, and a man might dwell by the lagoon two thousand years (if he could live so long) and never be any way troubled; and even on the seaside the devils did no harm if let alone. Only once a chief had cast a spear at one of the voices, and the same night he fell out of a cocoanut palm and was killed. Keola thought a good bit with himself.

So the people of the isle cut down the tree wherever it was found, and the devils came no more.\u201d They asked what kind of tree this was, and he showed them the tree of which Kalamake burned the leaves. They found it hard to believe, yet the idea tickled them. Night after night the old men debated it in their councils, but the high chief (though he was a brave man) was afraid of the matter, and reminded them daily of the chief who cast a spear against the voices and was killed, and the thought of that brought all to a stand again."}, {"size": 691, "text": "Though he could not yet bring about the destruction of the trees, Keola was well enough pleased, and began to look about him and take pleasure in his days; and, among other things, he was the kinder to his wife, so that the girl began to love him greatly.

The lamp burned very low, but he saw by her face she was in sorrow. \u201cKeola,\u201d she said, \u201cput your ear to my mouth that I may whisper, for no one must hear us.

They were elegant speakers, and they made beautiful poetry, and jested at meals, so that a missionary must have died laughing.

Early the next day, before the sun was yet up, a bustle woke him. He awoke in fear, for he thought the tribe had caught him napping: but it was no such matter. Only, on the beach in front of him, the bodiless voices called and shouted one upon another, and it seemed they all passed and swept beside him up the coast of the island."}, {"size": 620, "text": "\u201cWhat is afoot now?\u201d thinks Keola. And it was plain to him it was something beyond ordinary, for the fires were not lighted nor the shells taken, but the bodiless voices kept posting up the beach, and hailing and dying away; and others following, and by the sound of them these wizards should be angry. \u201cIt is not me they are angry at,\u201d thought Keola, \u201cfor they pass me close.\u201d As when hounds go by, or horses in a race, or city folk coursing to a fire, and all men join and follow after, so it was now with Keola; and he knew not what he did, nor why he did it, but there, lo and behold! he was running with the voices."}, {"size": 687, "text": "So he turned one point of the island, and this brought him in view of a second; and there he remembered the wizard trees to have been growing by the score together in a wood. From this point there went up a hubbub of men crying not to be described; and by the sound of them, those that he ran with shaped their course for the same quarter. A little nearer, and there began to mingle with the outcry the crash of many axes. And at this a thought came at last into his mind that the high chief had consented; that the men of the tribe had set-to cutting down these trees; that word had gone about the isle from sorcerer to sorcerer, and these were all now assembling to defend their trees."}, {"size": 642, "text": "Desire of strange things swept him on. He posted with the voices, crossed the beach, and came into the borders of the wood, and stood astonished. One tree had fallen, others were part hewed away. There was the tribe clustered. They were back to back, and bodies lay, and blood flowed among their feet. The hue of fear was on all their faces; their voices went up to heaven shrill as a weasel\u2019s cry. Have you seen a child when he is all alone and has a wooden sword, and fights, leaping and hewing with the empty air? Even so the man-eaters huddled back to back, and heaved up their axes, and laid on, and screamed as they laid on, and behold!"}, {"size": 686, "text": "no man to contend with them! only here and there Keola saw an axe swinging over against them without hands; and time and again a man of the tribe would fall before it, clove in twain or burst asunder, and his soul sped howling. For awhile Keola looked upon this prodigy like one that dreams, and then fear took him by the midst as sharp as death, that he should behold such doings. Even in that same flash the high chief of the clan espied him standing, and pointed and called out his name. Thereat the whole tribe saw him also, and their eyes flashed, and their teeth clashed. \u201cI am too long here,\u201d thought Keola, and ran further out of the wood and down the beach, not caring whither."}, {"size": 883, "text": "\u201cKeola!\u201d said, a voice close by upon the empty sand. \u201cLehua! is that you?\u201d he cried, and gasped, and looked in vain for her; but by the eyesight he was stark alone. \u201cI saw you pass before,\u201d the voice answered: \u201cbut you would not hear me. Quick! get the leaves and the herbs, and let us free.\u201d \u201cYou are there with the mat?\u201d he asked. \u201cHere, at your side;\u201d said she. And he felt her arms about him. \u201cQuick! the leaves and the herbs, before my father can get back!\u201d So Keola ran for his life, and fetched the wizard fuel; and Lehua guided him back, and set his feet upon the mat, and made the fire. All the time of its burning, the sound of the battle towered out of the wood; the wizards and the man-eaters hard at fight; the wizards, the viewless ones, roaring out aloud like bulls upon a mountain, and the men of the tribe replying shrill and savage out of the terror of their souls."}, {"size": 716, "text": "And all the time of the burning, Keola stood there and listened, and shook, and watched how the unseen hands of Lehua poured the leaves. She poured them fast, and the flame burned high, and scorched Keola\u2019s hands; and she speeded and blew the burning with her breath. The last leaf was eaten, the flame fell, and the shock followed, and there were Keola and Lehua in the room at home. Now, when Keola could see his wife at last he was mighty pleased, and he was mighty pleased to be home again in Molokai and sit down beside a bowl of poi\u2014for they make no poi on board ships, and there was none in the Isle of Voices\u2014and he was out of the body with pleasure to be clean escaped out of the hands of the eaters of men."}, {"size": 661, "text": "But there was another matter not so clear, and Lehua and Keola talked of it all night and were troubled. There was Kalamake left upon the isle. If, by the blessing of God, he could but stick there, all were well; but should he escape and return to Molokai, it would be an ill day for his daughter and her husband. They spoke of his gift of swelling, and whether he could wade that distance in the seas. But Keola knew by this time where that island was\u2014and that is to say, in the Low or Dangerous Archipelago. So they fetched the atlas and looked upon the distance in the map, and by what they could make of it, it seemed a far way for an old gentleman to walk."}, {"size": 767, "text": "Still, it would not do to make too sure of a warlock like Kalamake, and they determined at last to take counsel of a white missionary. So the first one that came by, Keola told him everything. And the missionary was very sharp on him for taking the second wife in the low island; but for all the rest, he vowed he could make neither head nor tail of it. \u201cHowever,\u201d says he, \u201cif you think this money of your father\u2019s ill gotten, my advice to you would be, give some of it to the lepers and some to the missionary fund. And as for this extraordinary rigmarole, you cannot do better than keep it to yourselves.\u201d But he warned the police at Honolulu that, by all he could make out, Kalamake and Keola had been coining false money, and it would not be amiss to watch them."}, {"size": 327, "text": "Keola and Lehua took his advice, and gave many dollars to the lepers and the fund. And no doubt the advice must have been good, for from that day to this, Kalamake has never more been heard of. But whether he was slain in the battle by the trees, or whether he is still kicking his heels upon the Isle of Voices, who shall say?"}, {"size": 40, "text": "{1} Please pronounce _pappa_ throughout."}]}
