Behind it jagged cliffs broke the north wind, and towered gray-white in the sunshine. Before it a tiny expanse of green sloped gently away to a point where the mountain dropped in another sharp descent, wooded with scrubby firs and pines. At the left a footpath led into the cool depths of the forest. But at the right the mountain fell away again and disclosed to view the picture David loved the best of all: the far-reaching valley; the silver pool of the lake with its ribbon of a river flung far out; and above it the grays and greens and purples of the mountains that climbed one upon another's shoulders until the topmost thrust their heads into the wide dome of the sky itself."

   "text": "There was no road, apparently, leading away from the cabin. There was only the footpath that disappeared into the forest. Neither, anywhere, was there a house in sight nearer than the white specks far down in the valley by the river. Within the shack a wide fireplace dominated one side of the main room. It was June now, and the ashes lay cold on the hearth; but from the tiny lean-to in the rear came the smell and the sputter of bacon sizzling over a blaze. The furnishings of the room were simple, yet, in a way, out of the common. There were two bunks, a few rude but comfortable chairs, a table, two music-racks, two violins with their cases, and everywhere books, and scattered sheets of music."

On the other hand, neither was there anywhere gun, pelt, or antlered head that spoke of a man's strength and skill. For decoration there were a beautiful copy of the Sistine Madonna, several photographs signed with names well known out in the great world beyond the mountains, and a festoon of pine cones such as a child might gather and hang. From the little lean-to kitchen the sound of the sputtering suddenly ceased, and at the door appeared a pair of dark, wistful eyes. \"Daddy!\" called the owner of the eyes."

   "text": "\"Father, are you there?\" called the voice, more insistently. From one of the bunks came a slight stir and a murmured word. At the sound the boy at the door leaped softly into the room and hurried to the bunk in the corner. He was a slender lad with short, crisp curls at his ears, and the red of perfect health in his cheeks. His hands, slim, long, and with tapering fingers like a girl's, reached forward eagerly. \"Daddy, come! I've done the bacon all myself, and the potatoes and the coffee, too. Quick, it's all getting cold!\" Slowly, with the aid of the boy's firm hands, the man pulled himself half to a sitting posture."

   "text": "His cheeks, like the boy's, were red--but not with health. His eyes were a little wild, but his voice was low and very tender, like a caress. \"David--it's my little son David!\" \"Of course it's David! Who else should it be?\" laughed the boy. \"Come!\" And he tugged at the man's hands. The man rose then, unsteadily, and by sheer will forced himself to stand upright. The wild look left his eyes, and the flush his cheeks. His face looked suddenly old and haggard. Yet with fairly sure steps he crossed the room and entered the little kitchen. Half of the bacon was black; the other half was transparent and like tough jelly."

   "text": "The potatoes were soggy, and had the unmistakable taste that comes from a dish that has boiled dry. The coffee was lukewarm and muddy. Even the milk was sour. David laughed a little ruefully. \"Things aren't so nice as yours, father,\" he apologized. \"I'm afraid I'm nothing but a discord in that orchestra to-day! Somehow, some of the stove was hotter than the rest, and burnt up the bacon in spots; and all the water got out of the potatoes, too,--though THAT didn't matter, for I just put more cold in. I forgot and left the milk in the sun, and it tastes bad now; but I'm sure next time it'll be better--all of it.\""

Aren't you ever going to let me try again, father?\" There was real distress in the boy's voice. The man hesitated. His lips parted with an indrawn breath, as if behind them lay a rush of words. But they closed abruptly, the words still unsaid. Then, very lightly, came these others:-- \"Well, son, this isn't a very nice way to treat your supper, is it? Now, if you please, I'll take some of that bacon. I think I feel my appetite coming back.\" If the truant appetite \"came back,\""

   "text": "however, it could not have stayed; for the man ate but little. He frowned, too, as he saw how little the boy ate. He sat silent while his son cleared the food and dishes away, and he was still silent when, with the boy, he passed out of the house and walked to the little bench facing the west. Unless it stormed very hard, David never went to bed without this last look at his \"Silver Lake,\" as he called the little sheet of water far down in the valley. \"Daddy, it's gold to-night--all gold with the sun!\" he cried rapturously, as his eyes fell upon his treasure. \"Oh, daddy!\" It was a long-drawn cry of ecstasy, and hearing it, the man winced, as with sudden pain."

   "text": "\"Daddy, I'm going to play it--I've got to play it!\" cried the boy, bounding toward the cabin. In a moment he had returned, violin at his chin. The man watched and listened; and as he watched and listened, his face became a battle-ground whereon pride and fear, hope and despair, joy and sorrow, fought for the mastery. It was no new thing for David to \"play\" the sunset. Always, when he was moved, David turned to his violin. Always in its quivering strings he found the means to say that which his tongue could not express. Across the valley the grays and blues of the mountains had become all purples now."

Below, the valley with its lake and river picked out in rose and gold against the shadowy greens of field and forest, seemed like some enchanted fairyland of loveliness. And all this was in David's violin, and all this, too, was on David's uplifted, rapturous face. As the last rose-glow turned to gray and the last strain quivered into silence, the man spoke. His voice was almost harsh with self-control. \"David, the time has come. We'll have to give it up--you and I.\" The boy turned wonderingly, his face still softly luminous."

It has been home; but, David, you didn't think we could always live here, like this, did you?\" David laughed softly, and turned his eyes once more to the distant sky-line. \"Why not?\" he asked dreamily. \"What better place could there be? I like it, daddy.\" The man drew a troubled breath, and stirred restlessly. The teasing pain in his side was very bad to-night, and no change of position eased it. He was ill, very ill; and he knew it. Yet he also knew that, to David, sickness, pain, and death meant nothing--or, at most, words that had always been lightly, almost unconsciously passed over."

   "text": "For the first time he wondered if, after all, his training--some of it--had been wise. For six years he had had the boy under his exclusive care and guidance. For six years the boy had eaten the food, worn the clothing, and studied the books of his father's choosing. For six years that father had thought, planned, breathed, moved, lived for his son. There had been no others in the little cabin. There had been only the occasional trips through the woods to the little town on the mountain-side for food and clothing, to break the days of close companionship. All this the man had planned carefully."

   "text": "He had meant that only the good and beautiful should have place in David's youth. It was not that he intended that evil, unhappiness, and death should lack definition, only definiteness, in the boy's mind. It should be a case where the good and the beautiful should so fill the thoughts that there would be no room for anything else. This had been his plan. And thus far he had succeeded--succeeded so wonderfully that he began now, in the face of his own illness, and of what he feared would come of it, to doubt the wisdom of that planning. As he looked at the boy's rapt face, he remembered David's surprised questioning at the first dead squirrel he had found in the woods."

Then, after a gentle touch: \"And he's cold--oh, so cold!\" The father had hurried his son away at the time, and had evaded his questions; and David had seemed content. But the next day the boy had gone back to the subject. His eyes were wide then, and a little frightened. \"Father, what is it to be--dead?\" \"What do you mean, David?\" \"The boy who brings the milk--he had the squirrel this morning. He said it was not asleep. It was--dead.\" \"It means that the squirrel, the real squirrel under the fur, has gone away, David.\""

He had remained strangely silent indeed for some days; then, out in the woods with his father one morning, he gave a joyous shout. He was standing by the ice-covered brook, and looking at a little black hole through which the hurrying water could be plainly seen. \"Daddy, oh, daddy, I know now how it is, about being--dead.\" \"It's like the water in the brook, you know; THAT'S going to a far country, and it isn't coming back. And it leaves its little cold ice-coat behind it just as the squirrel did, too."

   "text": "It does n't need it. It can go without it. Don't you see? And it's singing--listen!--it's singing as it goes. It WANTS to go!\" \"Yes, David.\" And David's father had sighed with relief that his son had found his own explanation of the mystery, and one that satisfied. Later, in his books, David found death again. It was a man, this time. The boy had looked up with startled eyes. \"Do people, real people, like you and me, be dead, father? Do they go to a far country? \"Yes, son in time--to a far country ruled over by a great and good King they tell us.\" David's father had trembled as he said it, and had waited fearfully for the result."
  },

   "text": "But David had only smiled happily as he answered: \"But they go singing, father, like the little brook. You know I heard it!\" And there the matter had ended. David was ten now, and not yet for him did death spell terror. Because of this David's father was relieved; and yet--still because of this--he was afraid. \"David,\" he said gently. \"Listen to me.\" The boy turned with a long sigh."

I like it here, and I've always been here.\" \"Not always, David; six years. You were four when I brought you here. You don't remember, perhaps.\" David shook his head. His eyes were again dreamily fixed on the sky. \"I think I'd like it--to go--if I could sail away on that little cloud-boat up there,\" he murmured. The man sighed and shook his head. \"We can't go on cloud-boats. We must walk, David, for a way--and we must go soon--soon,\""

He was appalled at his weakness. With a fierceness born of his terror he turned sharply to the boy at his side. \"David, we've got to go! We've got to go--TO-MORROW!\""

   "text": "\"Yes, yes, come!\" He stumbled blindly, yet in some way he reached the cabin door. Behind him David still sat, inert, staring. The next minute the boy had sprung to his feet and was hurrying after his father. A curious strength seemed to have come to the man. With almost steady hands he took down the photographs and the Sistine Madonna, packing them neatly away in a box to be left. From beneath his bunk he dragged a large, dusty traveling-bag, and in this he stowed a little food, a few garments, and a great deal of the music scattered about the room. David, in the doorway, stared in dazed wonder."

The other way. We go down into the valley this time.\" \"The valley--MY valley, with the Silver Lake?\" \"Yes, my son; and beyond--far beyond.\" The man spoke dreamily. He was looking at a photograph in his hand. It had slipped in among the loose sheets of music, and had not been put away with the others. It was the likeness of a beautiful woman."

You've never told me about any of them except the little round one that you wear in your pocket. Who are they?\" Instead of answering, the man turned faraway eyes on the boy and smiled wistfully. \"Ah, David, lad, how they'll love you! How they will love you! But you mustn't let them spoil you, son. You must remember--remember all I've told you.\" Once again David asked his question, but this time the man only turned back to the photograph, muttering something the boy could not understand."

With nervous haste the man was setting the little room to rights, crowding things into the bag, and packing other things away in an old trunk. His cheeks were very red, and his eyes very bright. He talked, too, almost constantly, though David could understand scarcely a word of what was said. Later, the man caught up his violin and played; and never before had David heard his father play like that. The boy's eyes filled, and his heart ached with a pain that choked and numbed--though why, David could not have told."
  },

   "size": 632,
   "text": "Still later, the man dropped his violin and sank exhausted into a chair; and then David, worn and frightened with it all, crept to his bunk and fell asleep. In the gray dawn of the morning David awoke to a different world. His father, white-faced and gentle, was calling him to get ready for breakfast. The little room, dismantled of its decorations, was bare and cold. The bag, closed and strapped, rested on the floor by the door, together with the two violins in their cases, ready to carry. \"We must hurry, son. It's a long tramp before we take the cars.\" \"The cars--the real cars? Do we go in those?\" David was fully awake now."

   "text": "\"And is that all we're to carry?\" \"But we come back--sometime?\" \"Father, we're coming back--sometime?\" David's voice was insistent now. The man stooped and tightened a strap that was already quite tight enough. Then he laughed lightly. \"Why, of course you're coming back sometime, David. Only think of all these things we're leaving!\" When the last dish was put away, the last garment adjusted, and the last look given to the little room, the travelers picked up the bag and the violins, and went out into the sweet freshness of the morning. As he fastened the door the man sighed profoundly; but David did not notice this."

Let's stay here,\" he cried ardently, drinking in the beauty of the morning. \"We must go, David. Come, son.\" And the man led the way across the green slope to the west. It was a scarcely perceptible trail, but the man found it, and followed it with evident confidence. There was only the pause now and then to steady his none-too-sure step, or to ease the burden of the bag. Very soon the forest lay all about them, with the birds singing over their heads, and with numberless tiny feet scurrying through the underbrush on all sides."

And David leaped, and laughed, and loved it all, nor was any of it strange to him. The birds, the trees, the sun, the brook, the scurrying little creatures of the forest, all were friends of his. But the man--the man did not leap or laugh, though he, too, loved it all. The man was afraid. He knew now that he had undertaken more than he could carry out. Step by step the bag had grown heavier, and hour by hour the insistent, teasing pain in his side had increased until now it was a torture."

Throbbing through his brain was the question, what if, after all, he could not--but even to himself he would not say the words. At noon they paused for luncheon, and at night they camped where the chattering brook had stopped to rest in a still, black pool. The next morning the man and the boy picked up the trail again, but without the bag. Under some leaves in a little hollow, the man had hidden the bag, and had then said, as if casually:-- \"I believe, after all, I won't carry this along."

Little use had David for bags or baggage! They were more than halfway down the mountain now, and soon they reached a grass-grown road, little traveled, but yet a road. Still later they came to where four ways crossed, and two of them bore the marks of many wheels. By sundown the little brook at their side murmured softly of quiet fields and meadows, and David knew that the valley was reached."

He was finding out now--though he but vaguely realized that something was not right. For some time his father had said but little, and that little had been in a voice that was thick and unnatural-sounding. He was walking fast, yet David noticed that every step seemed an effort, and that every breath came in short gasps. His eyes were very bright, and were fixedly bent on the road ahead, as if even the haste he was making was not haste enough. Twice David spoke to him, but he did not answer; and the boy could only trudge along on his weary little feet and sigh for the dear home on the mountain-top which they had left behind them the morning before."

For a moment he gazed dully into the boy's face; then a half-forgotten something seemed to stir him into feverish action. With shaking fingers he handed David his watch and a small ivory miniature. Then he searched his pockets until on the ground before him lay a shining pile of gold-pieces--to David there seemed to be a hundred of them. \"Take them--hide them--keep them. David, until you--need them,\" panted the man. \"Then go--go on. I can't.\" \"Alone? Without you?\" demurred the boy, aghast."

The man shook his head feebly, and pointed again to the gold-pieces. \"Take them, David,--hide them,\" he chattered with pale lips. Almost impatiently the boy began picking up the money and tucking it into his pockets. \"But, father, I'm not going without you,\" he declared stoutly, as the last bit of gold slipped out of sight, and a horse and wagon rattled around the turn of the road above."

The man was fumbling once more in his pockets. This time from his coat he produced a pencil and a small notebook from which he tore a page, and began to write, laboriously, painfully. David sighed and looked about him. He was tired and hungry, and he did not understand things at all. Something very wrong, very terrible, must be the matter with his father. Here it was almost dark, yet they had no place to go, no supper to eat, while far, far up on the mountain-side was their own dear home sad and lonely without them."

David's father had torn a second page from his book and was beginning another note, when the boy suddenly jumped to his feet. One of the straggling houses was near the road where they sat, and its presence had given David an idea."

It was David's turn to stare. Just what a tramp might be, he did not know; but never before had a request of his been so angrily refused. He knew that. A fierce something rose within him--a fierce new something that sent the swift red to his neck and brow. He raised a determined hand to the doorknob--he had something to say to that woman!--when the door suddenly opened again from the inside. \"See here, boy,\" began the woman, looking out at him a little less unkindly, \"if you're hungry I'll give you some milk and bread."

But there was his father--his poor father, who was so tired; and there was his own stomach clamoring to be fed. No, he could not refuse. And with slow steps and hanging head David went around the corner of the house to the rear. As the half-loaf of bread and the pail of milk were placed in his hands, David remembered suddenly that in the village store on the mountain, his father paid money for his food."

The woman began to shake her head; but, as her eyes fell on the money, she started, and bent closer to examine it. The next instant she jerked herself upright with an angry exclamation. \"It's gold! A ten-dollar gold-piece!"

Only a month before a man had tried to steal the violins from the cabin; and he was a thief, the milk-boy said. David flushed now again, angrily, as he faced the closed door. But he did not tarry. He turned and ran to his father. \"Father, come away, quick!"

With shaking hands he thrust the notes he had been writing into his pocket. The little book, from which he had torn the leaves for this purpose, had already dropped unheeded into the grass at his feet. \"Yes, son, yes, we'll go,\" muttered the man. \"I feel better now. I can--walk.\" And he did walk, though very slowly, ten, a dozen, twenty steps. From behind came the sound of wheels that stopped close beside them. \"Hullo, there! Going to the village?\" called a voice. \"Yes, sir.\" David's answer was unhesitating."

And together they aided his father to climb into the roomy wagon-body. There were few words said. The man at the reins drove rapidly, and paid little attention to anything but his horses. The sick man dozed and rested. The boy sat, wistful-eyed and silent, watching the trees and houses flit by. The sun had long ago set, but it was not dark, for the moon was round and bright, and the sky was cloudless."

He had begun to talk again, too,--low, half-finished sentences that David could not understand, and that vaguely troubled him. There was a house near by, and several others down the road toward the village; but David had had all the experience he wanted that night with strange houses, and strange women. There was a barn, a big one, which was nearest of all; and it was toward this barn that David finally turned his father's steps. \"We'll go there, daddy, if we can get in,\" he proposed softly. \"And we'll stay all night and rest.\""

Seen from the house, the barn and the low buildings beyond loomed shadowy and unreal, yet very beautiful. On the side porch of the house sat Simeon Holly and his wife, content to rest mind and body only because a full day's work lay well done behind them. It was just as Simeon rose to his feet to go indoors that a long note from a violin reached their ears. \"Simeon!\" cried the woman. \"What was that?\" The man did not answer. His eyes were fixed on the barn. \"Simeon, it's a fiddle!\" exclaimed Mrs."

Once inside the barn Simeon Holly and his wife paused involuntarily. The music was all about them now, filling the air with runs and trills and rollicking bits of melody. Giving an angry exclamation, the man turned then to the narrow stairway and climbed to the hayloft above.

For a moment the man and the woman on the stairway paused in amazement, then the man lifted his lantern and strode toward the voice. \"Who are you? What are you doing here?\" he demanded sharply.

The fact that, this morning, he had allowed, and was still allowing, the sacred routine of the day's work to be thus interrupted, for nothing more important than the expected arrival of a strolling urchin, was something Larson would not have believed had he not seen it. Even now he was conscious once or twice of an involuntary desire to rub his eyes to make sure they were not deceiving him. Impatient as the waiting men were for the arrival of David, they were yet almost surprised, so soon did he appear, running up the driveway."

And here it is,\" answered Higgins promptly, holding out the folded paper. Plainly eager as he was, David did not open the note till he had first carefully set down the case holding his violin; then he devoured it with eager eyes. As he read, the four men watched his face. They saw first the quick tears that had to be blinked away. Then they saw the radiant glow that grew and deepened until the whole boyish face was aflame with the splendor of it. They saw the shining wonder of his eyes, too, as he looked up from the letter."

David's letter was very different from the other one. It was longer, but it did not help much, though it was easily read. In his letter, in spite of the wavering lines, each word was formed with a care that told of a father's thought for the young eyes that would read it. It was written on two of the notebook's leaves, and at the end came the single word \"Daddy.\""

Who the man was the town authorities certainly did not know, neither could they apparently find out. His name, as written by himself, was unreadable. His notes told nothing; his son could tell little more--of consequence.

He was beginning to wonder just what was to become of himself. His father had said that out in the world there was a beautiful work for him to do; but what was it? How was he to find it? Or how was he to do it if he did find it? And another thing; where was he to live? Could he stay where he was? It was not home, to be sure; but there was the little room over the kitchen where he might sleep, and there was the kind woman who smiled at him sometimes with the sad, far-away look in her eyes that somehow hurt."

He must be thirty years old now. He had bright hopes not so long ago studying law, or something of the sort, in the city. Then his father died, and his mother, and he lost his health. Something ails his lungs, and the doctors sent him here to be out of doors. He even sleeps out of doors, they say. Anyway, he's here, and he's making a home for his sister; but, of course, with his hopes and ambitions--But there, David, you don't understand, of course!\" \"Oh, yes, I do,\" breathed David, his eyes pensively turned toward a shadowy corner. \"He found his work out in the world, and then he had to stop and couldn't do it.

Not because he was another mouth to feed--Simeon Holly was not worrying about that part any longer. Crops showed good promise, and all ready in the bank even now was the necessary money to cover the dreaded note, due the last of August. The complicating elements in regard to David were of quite another nature. To Simeon Holly the boy was a riddle to be sternly solved. To Ellen Holly he was an everpresent reminder of the little boy of long ago, and as such was to be loved and trained into a semblance of what that boy might have become. To Perry Larson, David was the \"derndest checkerboard of sense an' nonsense goin'\"--a game over which to chuckle."

Like old friends the melodies seemed, and so glad was David to see their notes again that he finished each production with a little improvised cadenza of ecstatic welcome--to Mr. Jack's increasing surprise and delight."

But once each year, man grown though he is, he picks up his violin and journeys to a little village far up among the hills. There in a quiet kitchen he plays to an old man and an old woman; and always to himself he says that he is practicing against the time when, his violin at his chin and the bow drawn across the strings, he shall go to meet his father in the far-away land, and tell him of the beautiful world he has left."
