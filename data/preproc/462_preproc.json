PHIL HAS A LITTLE DIFFICULTY. Phil Brent was plodding through the snow in the direction of the house where he lived with his step-mother and her son, when a snow-ball, moist and hard, struck him just below his ear with stinging emphasis. The pain was considerable, and Phil's anger rose. He turned suddenly, his eyes flashing fiercely, intent upon discovering who had committed this outrage, for he had no doubt that it was intentional."}, {"size": 658, "text": "He looked in all directions, but saw no one except a mild old gentleman in spectacles, who appeared to have some difficulty in making his way through the obstructed street. Phil did not need to be told that it was not the old gentleman who had taken such an unwarrantable liberty with him. So he looked farther, but his ears gave him the first clew. He heard a chuckling laugh, which seemed to proceed from behind the stone wall that ran along the roadside. \u201cI will see who it is,\u201d he decided, and plunging through the snow he surmounted the wall, in time to see a boy of about his own age running away across the fields as fast as the deep snow would allow."}, {"size": 685, "text": "\u201cSo it's you, Jonas!\u201d he shouted wrathfully. \u201cI thought it was some sneaking fellow like you.\u201d Jonas Webb, his step-brother, his freckled face showing a degree of dismay, for he had not calculated on discovery, ran the faster, but while fear winged his steps, anger proved the more effectual spur, and Phil overtook him after a brief run, from the effects of which both boys panted. \u201cWhat made you throw that snow-ball?\u201d demanded Phil angrily, as he seized Jonas by the collar and shook him. \u201cYou let me alone!\u201d said Jonas, struggling ineffectually in his grasp. \u201cAnswer me! What made you throw that snowball?\u201d demanded Phil, in a tone that showed he did not intend to be trifled with."}, {"size": 644, "text": "\u201cBecause I chose to,\u201d answered Jonas, his spite getting the better of his prudence. \u201cDid it hurt you?\u201d he continued, his eyes gleaming with malice. \u201cI should think it might. It was about as hard as a cannon-ball,\u201d returned Phil grimly. \u201cIs that all you've got to say about it?\u201d \u201cI did it in fun,\u201d said Jonas, beginning to see that he had need to be prudent. \u201cVery well! I don't like your idea of fun. Perhaps you won't like mine,\u201d said Phil, as he forcibly drew Jonas back till he lay upon the snow, and then kneeling by his side, rubbed his face briskly with snow. \u201cWhat are you doin'? Goin' to murder me?\u201d shrieked Jonas, in anger and dismay."}, {"size": 798, "text": "\u201cI am going to wash your face,\u201d said Phil, continuing the operation vigorously. \u201cI say, you quit that! I'll tell my mother,\u201d ejaculated Jonas, struggling furiously. \u201cIf you do, tell her why I did it,\u201d said Phil. Jonas shrieked and struggled, but in vain. Phil gave his face an effectual scrubbing, and did not desist until he thought he had avenged the bad treatment he had suffered. \u201cThere, get up!\u201d said he at length. Jonas scrambled to his feet, his mean features working convulsively with anger. \u201cYou'll suffer for this!\u201d he shouted. \u201cYou won't make me!\u201d said Phil contemptuously. \u201cYou're the meanest boy in the village.\u201d \u201cI am willing to leave that to the opinion of all who know me.\u201d \u201cI'll tell my mother!\u201d \u201cGo home and tell her!\u201d Jonas started for home, and Phil did not attempt to stop him."}, {"size": 641, "text": "As he saw Jonas reach the street and plod angrily homeward, he said to himself: \u201cI suppose I shall be in hot water for this; but I can't help it. Mrs. Brent always stands up for her precious son, who is as like her as can be. Well, it won't make matters much worse than they have been.\u201d Phil concluded not to go home at once, but to allow a little time for the storm to spend its force after Jonas had told his story. So he delayed half an hour and then walked slowly up to the side door. He opened the door, brushed off the snow from his boots with the broom that stood behind the door, and opening the inner door, stepped into the kitchen."}, {"size": 612, "text": "No one was there, as Phil's first glance satisfied him, and he was disposed to hope that Mrs. Brent--he never called her mother--was out, but a thin, acid, measured voice from the sitting-room adjoining soon satisfied him that there was to be no reprieve. \u201cPhilip Brent, come here!\u201d Phil entered the sitting-room. In a rocking-chair by the fire sat a thin woman, with a sharp visage, cold eyes and firmly compressed lips, to whom no child would voluntarily draw near.

Jonas, as if to emphasize these words, uttered a half groan. Philip could not help smiling, for to him it seemed ridiculous. \u201cYou laugh,\u201d said his step-mother sharply. \u201cI am not surprised at it.

He was not the only person amazed at this declaration. Jonas, forgetting for the moment the part he was playing, sat bolt upright on the sofa, with his large mouth wide open, staring by turns at Philip and his mother. \u201cGosh!\u201d he exclaimed in a tone indicating utter surprise and bewilderment. \u201cWill you repeat that, Mrs."}, {"size": 645, "text": "Brent?\u201d asked Philip, after a brief pause, not certain that he had heard aright. \u201cI spoke plain English, I believe,\u201d said Mrs. Brent coldly, enjoying the effect of her communication. \u201cI said that Mr. Brent, my late husband, was not your father.\u201d \u201cI don't believe you!\u201d burst forth Philip impetuously. \u201cYou don't wish to believe me, you mean,\u201d answered his step-mother, unmoved. \u201cNo, I don't wish to believe you,\u201d said the boy, looking her in the eye. \u201cYou are very polite to doubt a lady's word,\u201d said Mrs. Brent with sarcasm. \u201cIn such a matter as that I believe no one's word,\u201d said Phil. \u201cI ask for proof.\u201d \u201cWell, I am prepared to satisfy you."}, {"size": 745, "text": "Sit down and I will tell you the story.\u201d Philip sat down on the nearest chair and regarded his step-mother fixedly. \u201cWhose son am I,\u201d he demanded, \u201cif not Mr. Brent's?\u201d \u201cYou are getting on too fast. Jonas,\u201d continued his mother, suddenly turning to her hulking son, on whose not very intelligent countenance there was an expression of greedy curiosity, \u201cdo you understand that what I am going to say is to be a secret, not to be spoken of to any one?\u201d \u201cYes'm,\u201d answered Jonas readily. \u201cVery well.

Philip, you have heard probably that when you were very small your father--I mean Mr. Brent--lived in a small town in Ohio, called Fultonville?\u201d \u201cYes, I have heard him say so.\u201d \u201cDo you remember in what business he was then engaged?\u201d"}, {"size": 691, "text": "\u201cYes; a small hotel, but as large as the place required.

As a dependent upon the bounty of such a woman it would be worse. He resolved to leave home and strike out for himself, not from any such foolish idea of independence as sometimes leads boys to desert a good home for an uncertain skirmish with the world, but simply be cause he felt now that he had no real home.

He sat down on a box, and commenced drumming tunes with his heels on its sides. This disturbed Mr. Stone. He looked at him sharply, so he stopped and sauntered out into a corner of the back store, where there was a trap-door leading down into the water."}, {"size": 696, "text": "A small river ran by under the end of the store, also by the depot, which was near at hand, and his father used to have some of his goods brought down in boats and hoisted up through this door. It was always one of the most interesting places in the store to Fred; he liked to sit with his feet hanging down over the water, watching it as it came in and dashed against the cellar walls. To-day it was high, and a smart breeze drove it in with unusual force. Bending down as far as he could safely to look under the store, Fred saw the end of a hatchet sticking out from the corner of one of the abutments that projected from the cellar, to support the end of the store in which the trap-door was."}, {"size": 789, "text": "\u201cWhat a curious place this is for a hatchet!\u201d thought Fred, as he stooped a little further, holding on very tight to the floor above. What he saw made him almost lose his hold and drop into the water below. There, stretched along on a beam was Sam Crandon, with some stolen packages near him. For a moment Fred's astonishment was too great to allow him to speak; and Sam glared at him like a wild beast brought suddenly to bay. \u201cOh, Sam! Sam!\u201d said Fred, at length, \u201chow could you?\u201d Sam caught up a hatchet and looked as if he was going to aim it at him, then suddenly dropped it into the water. Fred's heart beat fast, and the blood came and went from his cheeks; he caught his breath heavily, and the water, the abutment and even Sam with his wicked ugly face were for a moment darkened."}, {"size": 266, "text": "Then, recovering himself, he said: \u201cWas it you, Sam?

He had only to lift his head and call his father, then the boat would be immediately pushed in under the store, Sam secured and his punishment certain. There were stolen goods enough to convict him, and his mode of ingress into the store was now certain. This trap-door was never locked; very often it was left open--the water being considered the most effectual bolt and bar that could be used; but Sam, a good swimmer and climber, had come in without difficulty and had quite a store of his own hidden away there for future use. This course was very plain; but for some reason, which Fred could not explain even to himself, he did not feel inclined to take it; so he sat looking steadily in Sam's face until he said: \u201cLook here, Sam, I want to show you I mean what I say."}, {"size": 740, "text": "I'm sorry you have turned thief and if I can help you to be a better boy, I should be glad to.\u201d Again Fred's honest kindly face had the same effect upon Sam that it had at the commencement of their street fight; he respected and trusted it unconsciously. \u201cHere!\u201d said he, crawling along on the beam and handing back the package of knives, the last theft of which his father had complained. \u201cYes, that is right,\u201d said Fred, leaning down and taking it, \u201cgive them all back, if you can; that is what my father calls 'making restitution,' and then you won't be a thief any longer.\u201d Something in the boy's tone touched Sam's heart still more; so he handed back one thing after another as rapidly as he could until nearly everything was restored."}, {"size": 445, "text": "\u201cBravo for you, Sam! I won't tell who took them, and there is a chance for you. Here, give me your hand now, honor bright you'll never come here again to steal, if I don't tell my father.\u201d Sam looked at him a moment, as if he would read his very soul; then he said sulkily: \u201cYou'll tell; I know you will, 'cause I licked you when you didn't want me to; but you've got 'em all back, and I s'pose it won't go very hard.\u201d \u201cWhat won't go very hard?\u201d"}, {"size": 614, "text": "\u201cYou sha'n't go to prison at all.

It began Fred Sargent's revenge. \u201cNow be off, will you, before the clerks come? They will see the things and catch you here."}, {"size": 609, "text": "I'll be round to your house soon and we will see.\u201d Even in this short time Fred had formed a general plan for saving Sam. The boy, stretching himself out flat, slipped down the transverse beam into the water, dived at once and came up under the bridge a few rods distant, then coolly passed down the river and swam to shore under a bunch of alder-bushes, by which he was concealed from the sight of the passers-by. Fred sought his father, told him the story, then brought him to the spot, showed the goods which the boy had returned, and begged as a reward for the discovery to be allowed to conceal his name."}, {"size": 602, "text": "His father of course hesitated at so unusual a proposition; but there was something so very much in earnest in all Fred did and said that he became convinced it was best, for the present at least, to allow him to have his own way; and this he was very glad he had done when a few days after Fred asked him to do something for Sam Crandon. \u201cSam Crandon?\u201d he asked in surprise. \u201cIs not that the very boy I found you fighting in the street with?\u201d \u201cYes, sir,\u201d said Fred, hanging his head, \u201cbut he promises to do well, if he can only find work--HONEST work; you see, sir, he is so bad nobody helps him.\u201d Mr."}, {"size": 897, "text": "Sargent smiled. \u201cA strange recommendation, Fred,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I will try what can be done.

Father, if you only will!\u201d Fred, as he stood there, his whole face lit up with the glow of this generous, noble emotion, never was dearer to his father's heart; indeed his father's eyes were dim, and his voice a little husky, as he said again: \u201cI will look after him, Fred, for your sake.\u201d And so he did; but where and how I have not space now to tell my readers. Perhaps, at some future time, I may finish this story; for the present let me say there is a new boy in Mr. Sargent's store, with rough, coarse face, voice and manners; everybody wonders at seeing him there; everybody prophesies future trouble; but nobody knows that this step up in Sam Crandon's life is Fred Sargent's revenge."}, {"size": 791, "text": "Hubert had accompanied his father on a visit to his uncle, who lived in a fine old country mansion, on the shore of Caermarthen Bay. In front of the house spread a long beach, which terminated in precipitous cliffs and rocky ledges. On the afternoon of the day following his arrival, he declared his intention of exploring the beach. \u201cDon't get caught in 'The Smuggler's Trap,'\u201d said his uncle, as he mentioned his plan. \u201c'The Smuggler's Trap?'\u201d \u201cYes. It's at the end of the beach where you see the cliffs. It's a hollow cave, which you can only walk at very low tide. You'd better not go in there.\u201d \u201cOh, never fear,\u201d said Hubert carelessly, and in a few minutes he was wandering over the beach, and after walking about two miles reached the end of the beach at the base of the great cliffs."}, {"size": 717, "text": "The precipice towered frowningly overhead, its base all worn and furrowed by the furious surges that for ages had dashed against it. All around lay a chaos of huge boulders covered with seaweed. The tide was now at the lowest ebb. The surf here was moderate, for the seaweed on the rocks interfered with the swell of the waters, and the waves broke outside at some distance. Between the base of the precipice and the edge of the water there was a space left dry by the ebb tide about two yards in width; and Hubert walked forward over the space thus uncovered to see what lay before him. He soon found himself in a place which seemed like a fissure rent in a mountain side, by some extraordinary convulsion of nature."}, {"size": 659, "text": "All around rose black, precipitous cliffs. On the side nearest was the precipice by whose base he had passed; while over opposite was a gigantic wall of dark rock, Which extended far out into the sea. Huge waves thundered at its feet and dashed their spray far upward into the air. The space was about fifty yards across. The fissure extended back for about two hundred yards, and there terminated in a sharp angle formed by the abrupt walls of the cliffs which enclosed it. All around there were caverns worn into the base of the precipices by the action of the sea. The floor of this place was gravelly, but near the water it was strewn with large boulders."}, {"size": 637, "text": "Further in there were no boulders and it was easy to walk about. At the furthest extremity there was a flat rock that seemed to have fallen from the cliff above in some former age. The cliffs around were about two hundred feet in height. They were perfectly bare, and intensely black. On their storm-riven summits not a sign of verdure appeared. Everything had the aspect of gloom, which was heightened by the mournful monotone of the sea waves as they dashed against the rock. After the first feeling of awe had passed, Hubert ran forward, leaping from rock to rock, till he came to where the beach or floor of the fissure was gravelly."}, {"size": 667, "text": "Over this he walked and hastened to the caverns, looking into them one after another. Then he busied himself by searching among the pebbles for curious stones and shells. He found here numerous specimens of the rarest and finest treasures of the sea--shells of a delicacy of tint and perfection of outline; seaweeds of new and exquisite forms with rich hues which he had hitherto believed impossible. In the hollows of the rocks, where the water yet lay in pools, he found little minnows; and delicate jelly fish, with their long slender fibers; and sea anemones; and sea urchins with their spires extended; and star-fish moving about with their innumerable creepers."}, {"size": 672, "text": "It was a new world, a world which had thus far been only visible to him in the aquarium, and now as it stood before him he forgot all else. He did not feel the wind as it blew in fresh from the sea--the dread \u201csou'wester,\u201d the terror of fishermen. He did not notice the waves that rolled in more furiously from without, and were now beginning to break in wrath upon the rocky ledges and boulders. He did not see that the water had crept on nearer to the cliff, and that a white line of foam now lay on that narrow belt of beach which he had traversed at the foot of the cliff. Suddenly a sound burst upon his ears that roused him, and sent all the blood back to his heart."}, {"size": 751, "text": "It was his own name, called out in a voice of anguish and almost of despair by his father. He sprang to his feet, started forward and rushed with the speed of the wind to the place by which he had entered the enclosure. But a barrier lay before him.

He was caught in the \u201cSmuggler's Trap,\u201d and the full meaning of his uncle's warning flashed upon his mind as in his terror he shrieked back to his father.

No sooner had he heard Hubert's answering cry than he rushed forward to try and save him. But the next moment a great wave came rolling in and dashed him upon the cliff. Terribly bruised, he clung to the cliff till the surf fell back, and then ran on again. He slipped over a rock and fell, but instantly regaining his feet he advanced further, and in his haste fell into a hollow which was filled with water."}, {"size": 665, "text": "Before he could emerge another wave was upon him.

He noticed that the surf grew more violent every moment, and every moment took away hope. But he would not yield. Once more he rushed forward. The waves rolled in, but he grasped the rocks and withstood the surf, and still advanced. Another followed. He bowed before it, and clinging to the rocks as before came forth triumphant."}, {"size": 646, "text": "Already he was nearly halfway. He sprang upon a rock that rose above the level of the seething flood, and stood for a moment panting and gasping. But now a great wave came rolling in upon him.

He threw his arms wildly about, but found nothing which he could seize. The retreating wave sucked him back. But a rock stayed him. This he grasped and was saved. Then, hastily scrambling to his feet, he staggered back to the place from which he had started."}, {"size": 646, "text": "Before he could get back another wave threw him down, and this time he might have been drowned had not his brother plunged in and dragged him out. Of all this Hubert had seen nothing, and known nothing. He waited for some time in silence, and then called. There was no answer. He called again and again. But at that time his father was struggling with the waves and did not hear him. At last, after what seemed an interminable time, he heard once more his father's voice. He shouted back. \u201cDon't be afraid!\u201d cried the voice. \u201cI'll get you out. Wait.\u201d And then there were no more voices.

Hubert was now left alone with the rising tide, whose waters rolled forward with fearful rapidity. The beach inside was nearly level and he saw that in an hour or so it would be covered with the waters. He tried to trust to his father's promise, but the precious moments passed and he began to look with terror upon the increasing storm; for every moment the wind grew fiercer, and the surf rolled in with ever increasing impetuosity. He looked all around for a place of refuge, and saw nothing except the rock which arose at the extremity of the place, at the foot of the overhanging cliffs."}, {"size": 730, "text": "It was about five feet high, and was the only place that afforded anything like safety. Up this he clambered, and from this he could survey the scene, but only to perceive the full extent of his danger.

The moments passed slowly. Minutes seemed in his suspense to be transformed to hours. The sky was overspread now with black clouds; and the gloom increased. At length the waves rolled in until they covered all the beach in front, and began to dash against the rock on which he had taken refuge."}, {"size": 626, "text": "The precious moments passed. Higher and higher grew the waters. They came rolling into the cave, urged on by the fury of the billows outside, and heaping themselves up as they were compressed into this narrow gorge. They dashed up around the rock. The spray was tossed in his face. Already he felt their inexorable grasp. Death seemed so near that hope left him. He fell upon his knees with his hands clasped, and his white face upturned. Just then a great wave rolled up and flung itself over the rock, and over his knees as he knelt, and over his hands as he clasped them in prayer. A few more moments and all would be over."}, {"size": 429, "text": "As hope left a calmness came--the calmness that is born of despair.

Oh, make haste!\u201d A rope was made fast about Hubert's father, and he was let down over the edge of the cliff. He would allow no other than himself to undertake this journey. He had hurried away and gathered a number of fishermen, whose stout arms and sinewy hands now held the rope by which he descended to save his son. It was a perilous journey. The wind blew and the rope swayed more and more as it was let down, and sometimes he was dashed against the rocky sides of the precipice; but still he descended, and at last stood on the rock and clasped his son in his arms."}, {"size": 387, "text": "But there was no time to lose.
