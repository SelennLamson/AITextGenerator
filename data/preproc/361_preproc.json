SOME OPINIONS AND A WEDDING “I, Bertram, take thee, Billy,” chanted the white-robed clergyman. “'I, Bertram, take thee, Billy,'” echoed the tall young bridegroom, his eyes gravely tender. “'To my wedded wife.'” The bridegroom's voice shook a little. “To have and to hold from this day forward.” “'To have and to hold from this day forward.'” Now the young voice rang with triumph. It had grown strong and steady. “For better for worse.” “'For better for worse.'” “For richer for poorer,” droned the clergyman, with the weariness of uncounted repetitions. “'For richer for poorer,'” avowed the bridegroom, with the decisive emphasis of one to whom the words are new and significant."

In one corner a white-haired woman blinked tear-wet eyes and pulled a fleecy white shawl more closely about her shoulders."

I couldn't do one thing to prevent it. Much as ever as they would even listen to what I had to say--and when they knew how I had hurried East to say it, too, with only two hours' notice! “But then, what can you expect? From time immemorial lovers never did have any sense; and when those lovers are such irresponsible flutterbudgets as Billy and Bertram--!“And such a wedding!

There was no maid of honor, no bridesmaids, no wedding cake, no wedding veil, no presents (except from the family, and from that ridiculous Chinese cook of brother William's, Ding Dong, or whatever his name is. He tore in just before the wedding ceremony, and insisted upon seeing Billy to give her a wretched little green stone idol, which he declared would bring her 'heap plenty velly good luckee' if she received it before she 'got married.' I wouldn't have the hideous, grinning thing around, but William says it's real jade, and very valuable, and of course Billy was crazy over it--or pretended to be)."

There was no anything but the bridegroom; and when I tell you that Billy actually declared that was all she wanted, you will understand how absurdly in love she is--in spite of all those weeks and weeks of broken engagement when I, at least, supposed she had come to her senses, until I got that crazy note from Bertram a week ago saying they were to be married today. “I can't say that I've got any really satisfactory explanation of the matter. Everything has been in such a hubbub, and those two ridiculous children have been so afraid they wouldn't be together every minute possible, that any really rational conversation with either of them was out of the question."

As near as I can make out, however, she thought he didn't want her, and he thought she didn't want him. I believe matters were still further complicated by a girl Bertram was painting, and a young fellow that used to sing with Billy--a Mr. Arkwright. “Anyhow, things came to a head last spring, Billy broke the engagement and fled to parts unknown with Aunt Hannah, leaving Bertram here in Boston to alternate between stony despair and reckless gayety, according to William; and it was while he was in the latter mood that he had that awful automobile accident and broke his arm--and almost his neck. He was wildly delirious, and called continually for Billy."

Just exactly what happened I can't say, but I do know that she dragged poor old Aunt Hannah down to Bertram's at some unearthly hour, and in the rain; and Aunt Hannah couldn't do a thing with her. All Billy would say, was, 'Bertram wants me.' And Aunt Hannah told me that if I could have seen Billy's face I'd have known that she'd have gone to Bertram then if he'd been at the top of the Himalaya Mountains, or at the bottom of the China Sea. So perhaps it's just as well--for Aunt Hannah's sake, at least--that he was in no worse place than on his own couch at home. Anyhow, she went, and in half an hour they blandly informed Aunt Hannah that they were going to be married to-day."

And when he declared he'd marry her the next day if it wasn't for the new license law, Aunt Hannah said she gave up for fear he'd get a special dispensation, or go to the Governor or the President, or do some other dreadful thing. (What a funny old soul Aunt Hannah is!) Bertram told _me_ that he should never feel safe till Billy was really his; that she'd read something, or hear something, or think something, or get a letter from me (as if anything _I_ could say would do any good-or harm!), and so break the engagement again."

I still say that they are not one bit suited to each other, and that matrimony will simply ruin his career. Bertram never has loved and never will love any girl long--except to paint. But if he simply _would_ get married, why couldn't he have taken a nice, sensible domestic girl that would have kept him fed and mended? “Not but that I'm very fond of Billy, as you know, dear; but imagine Billy as a wife--worse yet, a mother! Billy's a dear girl, but she knows about as much of real life and its problems as--as our little Kate."

In the home of Bertram's brother Cyril, Cyril himself was at the piano, but where his thoughts were was plain to be seen--or rather, heard; for from under his fingers there came the Lohengrin wedding march until all the room seemed filled with the scent of orange blossoms, the mistiness of floating veils, and the echoing peals of far-away organs heralding the “Fair Bride and Groom.” Over by the table in the glowing circle of the shaded lamp, sat Marie, Cyril's wife, a dainty sewing-basket by her side."

Cyril whirled about on the piano stool. “It was a very sensible wedding,” he said with emphasis. “They looked so happy--both of them,” went on Marie, dreamily; “so--so sort of above and beyond everything about them, as if nothing ever, ever could trouble them--_now_.” Cyril lifted his eyebrows. “Humph! Well, as I said before, it was a very _sensible_ wedding,” he declared. This time Marie noticed the emphasis. She laughed, though her eyes looked a little troubled."

For a man known for years to his friends as a “hater of women and all other confusion,” Cyril Henshaw was looking remarkably well-pleased with himself. His wife of less than a year colored as she met his gaze. Hurriedly she picked up her needle."

You--you told me not to, long ago. You said my darns made--bunches. “Ho! I meant I didn't want to _wear_ them,” retorted the man, upon whom the tragic wretchedness of that half-sobbed “bunches” had been quite lost. “I love to see you _mending_ them,” he finished, with an approving glance at the pretty little picture of domesticity before him. A peculiar expression came to Marie's eyes. “Why, Cyril, you mean you _like_ to have me mend them just for--for the sake of seeing me do it, when you _know_ you won't ever wear them?” “Sure!” nodded the man, imperturbably."

The vaguely troubled look had fled from her eyes “Oh, Billy's helped me beat eggs and butter sometimes, but I never knew her to cook a thing or want to cook a thing, but once; then she spent nearly two weeks trying to learn to make puddings--for you.” Marie puckered her lips queerly. “Well, I supposed they were for you at the time. At all events she was trying to make them for some one of you boys; probably it was really for Bertram, though.” “Humph!” grunted Cyril.

But who were they all, anyway?” “Why, you knew Mrs. Greggory and Alice, of course--and Pete,” smiled Marie. “And wasn't Pete happy?

I think it was lovely of her to have them, and they did have such a good time! You should have seen Tommy when you played that wedding march for Billy to enter the room.

She's helping Rosa put the house to rights, and she's stopping to cry over every slipper and handkerchief of Billy's she finds.

In the Strata, the Henshaws' old Beacon Street home, William was sitting before the fireplace with the cat in his lap, but he was not dozing. He was talking. “Spunkie,” he was saying, “your master, Bertram, got married to-day--and to Miss Billy. He'll be bringing her home one of these days--your new mistress. And such a mistress!

That girl was Miss Billy, and she was a dear then, just as she is now, only now she's coming here to stay. She's coming home, Spunkie; and she'll make it a home for you, for me, and for all of us.

For we're going to have a home, Spunkie--a home!” At Hillside, Aunt Hannah was, indeed, helping Rosa to put the house to rights, as Marie had said. She was crying, too, over a glove she had found on Billy's piano; but she was crying over something else, also. Not only had she lost Billy, but she had lost her home.

No wonder, indeed, that Aunt Hannah sat crying and patting the little white glove in her hand. No wonder, too, that--being Aunt Hannah--she reached for the shawl near by and put it on, shiveringly.

Arkwright to-night was plainly moody and ill at ease. “You're not listening. You're not listening at all,” complained Alice Greggory at last, reproachfully.

I've almost told you, though, lots of times; you've been so good to me all these weeks.” He raised his head now, and looked at her, frank comradeship in his eyes. The girl stirred restlessly. Her eyes swerved a little under his level gaze. “Oh, but I've done nothing--n-nothing,” she stammered.

In Billy's opinion, a man's unrequited love for a girl was his secret, not hers, and was certainly one that the girl had no right to tell.

I--I feel so nervous and unsettled! Did--did Billy say anything to you--what she was going to do?” “What she was going to do?"

William frowned thoughtfully. “Why, no,” he answered. “It was all so hurried at the last, you know. There was really very little chance to make plans for anything--except the wedding,” he finished, with a smile. “Yes, I know,” sighed Aunt Hannah. “Everything was in such confusion! Still, I didn't know but she might have said something--to you.” “No, she didn't. But I imagine it won't be hard to guess what she'll do. When they get back from their trip I fancy she won't lose much time in having what things she wants brought down here."

Then don't you think we'd better dismiss Rosa and close the house at once?” “Why--yes, perhaps so. Why not? Then you'd be all settled here when she comes home. I'm sure, the sooner you come, the better I'll be pleased,” he smiled. Aunt Hannah turned sharply. “Here!” she ejaculated. “William Henshaw, you didn't suppose I was coming _here_ to live, did you?” It was William's turn to look amazed. “Why, of course you're coming here!"

As if Billy would listen to that! You came before; why not come now?” Aunt Hannah lifted her chin the fraction of an inch. “You forget. I was needed before. Billy is a married woman now. She needs no chaperon.” “Nonsense!” scowled William, again. “Billy will always need you.” Aunt Hannah shook her head mournfully. “I like to think--she wants me, William, but I know, in my heart, it isn't best.”"

You are shocked, of course. I shouldn't have told you. Still, it is all past long ago, and--I wanted to make you understand why I can't come. He was my husband's eldest brother--a bachelor.

By the thirty-first of August the old Beacon Street homestead facing the Public Garden was in spick-and-span order, with Dong Ling in the basement hovering over a well-stocked larder, and Pete searching the rest of the house for a chair awry, or a bit of dust undiscovered. Twice before had the Strata--as Bertram long ago dubbed the home of his boyhood--been prepared for the coming of Billy, William's namesake: once, when it had been decorated with guns and fishing-rods to welcome the “boy” who turned out to be a girl; and again when with pink roses and sewing-baskets the three brothers got joyously ready for a feminine Billy who did not even come at all."

The floor below, too, was silent now, and almost empty save for a rug or two, and a few pieces of heavy furniture that William had not cared to take with him to his new quarters on top of Beacon Hill.

She was wearing a gray shawl to-day topped with a black one--sure sign of unrest, either physical or mental, as all her friends knew. “I'd begun to think you'd forgotten--me,” she faltered, with a poor attempt at gayety. “You've been home three whole days.” “I know, dearie,” smiled Billy; “and 'twas a shame.

Twice, when she had been playing to him, she turned to find him testing the suppleness of his injured arm. Several times, failing to receive an answer to her questions, she had looked up to discover him gazing abstractedly at nothing in particular. They read and walked and talked together, to be sure, and Bertram's devotion to her lightest wish was beyond question; but more and more frequently these days Billy found him hovering over his sketches in his studio; and once, when he failed to respond to the dinner-bell, search revealed him buried in a profound treatise on “The Art of Foreshortening.” Then came the day"

Advancing toward her husband she held them out dramatically. “And now paint, my lord, paint!” she commanded him, with stern insistence, as she thrust them into his hands.

He painted still more the next, and yet more again the day following. He was like a bird let out of a cage, so joyously alive was he. The old sparkle came back to his eye, the old gay smile to his lips.

BILLY CULTIVATES A “COMFORTABLE INDIFFERENCE” The next morning, under the uncompromising challenge of a bright sun, Billy began to be uneasily suspicious that she had been just a bit unreasonable and exacting the night before. To make matters worse she chanced to run across a newspaper criticism of a new book bearing the ominous title: “When the Honeymoon Wanes A Talk to Young Wives.” Such a title, of course, attracted her supersensitive attention at once; and, with a curiously faint feeling, she picked up the paper and began to read. As the most of the criticism was taken up with quotations from the book, it was such sentences as these that met her startled eyes:"

Then is when the husband--used all his life to independence, perhaps--begins to chafe under these new bonds that hold him so fast....

In the kitchen a cheery bubbling from the potatoes on the stove greeted her. Billy's spirits rose with the steam. “There, Spunkie,” she said gayly to the cat, who had just uncurled from a nap behind the stove. “Tell me I can't get up a dinner!

Billy was not in her room, nor anywhere on that floor. She was not in William's room. Coming down-stairs to the hall again, Bertram confronted William, who had just come in. “Where's Billy?” demanded the young husband, with just a touch of irritation, as if he suspected William of having Billy in his pocket.

Such was Billy's dinner. The grapefruit everybody ate. The cold lamb too, met with a hearty reception, especially after the potatoes, corn, and tomatoes were served--and tasted.

CALDERWELL DOES SOME QUESTIONING On the day after his dinner with Mr. and Mrs. Bertram Henshaw, Hugh Calderwell left Boston and did not return until more than a month had passed.

Calderwell had not seen Arkwright since they parted in Paris some two years before, after a six-months tramp through Europe together. Calderwell liked Arkwright then, greatly, and he lost no time now in renewing the acquaintance.

To himself Bertram owned that Billy was, in some ways, a puzzle to him. Her conduct was still erratic at times. One day he would seem to be everything to her; the next--almost nothing, judging by the ease with which she relinquished his society and substituted that of some one else: Arkwright, or Calderwell, for instance. And that was another thing. Bertram was ashamed to hint even to himself that he was jealous of either of those men."

At such times, always, though, if he did feel impatient, he immediately demanded of himself: “Are you, then, the kind of husband that begrudges your wife young companions of her own age and tastes to help her while away the hours that you cannot possibly spend with her yourself?” This question, and the answer that his better self always gave to it, were usually sufficient to send him into some florists for a bunch of violets for Billy, or into a candy shop on a like atoning errand."

The next ten minutes Bertram spent in going through the whole house, from garret to basement. Needless to say, he found nothing to enlighten him, or to soothe his temper. Four o'clock came, then half-past, and five. At five Bertram began to look for Eliza, but in vain. At half-past five he watched for William; but William, too, did not come."

Now in selecting the diet for the day you should take care to choose those foods which give the proteins, fats, and carbohydrates in just the right proportion.'” “Oh, Billy!” groaned Bertram. “But it's so, Bertram,” maintained Billy, anxiously. “And it's every bit here."

Besides, the little rascals have apparently fixed up some sort of labor-union compact with each other, so that if one cries for something or nothing, the other promptly joins in and helps.

Billy went so far into the Valley of the Shadow of Death for her baby that it was some days before she realized in all its importance the presence of the new member of her family. Even when the days had become weeks, and Bertram, Jr., was a month and a half old, the extreme lassitude and weariness of his young mother was a source of ever-growing anxiety to her family and friends. Billy was so unlike herself, they all said. “If something could only rouse her,” suggested the Henshaw's old family physician one day."

Two days later Bertram's sister Kate, on her way with her husband to Mr. Hartwell's old home in Vermont, stopped over in Boston for a two days' visit. She made her headquarters at Cyril's home, but very naturally she went, without much delay, to pay her respects to Bertram, Jr. “Mr. Hartwell's brother isn't well,” she explained to Billy, after the greetings were over."

Billy told her husband very earnestly that now they had entered upon a period of Enormous Responsibility.

As to the Life and Character and Destiny intrusted to his care, it is to be feared that Bertram just plain gloried in his son, poked him in the ribs, and chuckled him under the chin whenever he pleased, and gave never so much as a thought to Character and Destiny.

To be sure, for a week he went back and forth between the city and the beach house; but it happened to be a time when Bertram, Jr., was cutting a tooth, and this so wore upon William's sympathy--William still could not help insisting it _might_ be a pin--that he concluded peace lay only in flight."

Once again he could do nothing but read, or wander disconsolately into his studio and gaze at his half-finished “Face of a Girl.” Occasionally, it is true, driven nearly to desperation by the haunting vision in his mind's eye, he picked up a brush and attempted to make his left hand serve his will; but a bare half-dozen irritating, ineffectual strokes were usually enough to make him throw down his brush in disgust.

Why, Bertram, of course you will,” she cried confidently. “But, Billy, the doctor said,” began Bertram; but Billy would not even listen. “Very well, what if he did, dear?” she interrupted. “What if he did say you couldn't use your right arm much again?” Billy's voice broke a little, then quickly steadied into something very much like triumph. “You've got your left one!” Bertram shook his head. “I can't paint with that.”"

And I'm going to be ever so much prouder of what you paint now, because I'll know how splendidly you worked to do it. Besides, there's Baby. As if you weren't ever going to paint for Baby! Why, Bertram, I'm going to have you paint Baby, one of these days. Think how pleased he'll be to see it when he grows up! He's nicer, anyhow, than any old 'Face of a Girl' you ever did. Paint? Why, Bertram, darling, of course you're going to paint, and better than you ever did before!” Bertram shook his head again; but this time he smiled, and patted Billy's cheek with the tip of his forefinger."

For some time he stood motionless before it; then, with a quick gesture of determination, he got out his palette, paints, and brushes. This time not until he had painted ten, a dozen, a score of strokes, did he drop his brush with a sigh and carefully erase the fresh paint on the canvas. The next day he worked longer, and this time he allowed a little, a very little, of what he had done to remain. The third day Billy herself found him at his easel. “I wonder--do you suppose I could?” he asked fearfully."

And, of course, the more you do with it, the more you can!” “I know; but that doesn't mean that I can paint with it,” sighed Bertram, ruefully eyeing the tiny bit of fresh color his canvas showed for his long afternoon's work. “You wait and see,” nodded Billy, with so overwhelming a cheery confidence that Bertram, looking into her glowing face, was conscious of a curious throb of exultation, almost as if already the victory were his."

Bertram, hanging over the baby's crib to assure himself that the rosiness and the sparkle were really growing more apparent every day, used to wonder sometimes how ever in the world he could have been jealous of his son. He said as much one day to Billy. To Billy it was a most astounding idea. “You mean you were actually jealous of your own baby?” she gasped. “Why, Bertram, how could--And was that why you--you sought distraction and--Oh, but, Bertram, that was all my f-fault,” she quavered remorsefully. “I wouldn't play, nor sing, nor go to walk, nor anything; and I wore horrid frowzy wrappers all the time, and--” “Oh, come, come, Billy,” expostulated the man."

And then, because some things had grown small to them, and some others great, they both laughed happily. But even this was not quite all; for one evening, very shyly, Billy brought out the chessboard. “Of course I can't play well,” she faltered; “and maybe you don't want to play with me at all.” But Bertram, when he found out why she had learned, was very sure he did want very much to play with her."

And though, in the end, her king was ignominiously trapped with not an unguarded square upon which to set his poor distracted foot, the memory of those blissful minutes when she had made Bertram “stare” more than paid for the final checkmate. By the middle of June the baby was well enough to be taken to the beach, and Bertram was so fortunate as to secure the same house they had occupied before. Once again William went down in Maine for his fishing trip, and the Strata was closed."

It was not the “Face of a Girl,” now. It was the face of a baby: smiling, laughing, even crying, sometimes; at other times just gazing straight into your eyes with adorable soberness. Bertram still went into Boston twice a week for treatment, though the treatment itself had changed. The great surgeon had sent him to still another specialist. “There's a chance--though perhaps a small one,” he had said. “I'd like you to try it, anyway.” As the summer advanced, Bertram thought sometimes that he could see a slight improvement in his injured arm; but he tried not to think too much about this."

Then, too, there was the baby--he had no idea a baby could be so interesting to paint. He was not sure but that he was going to like to paint babies even better than he had liked to paint his “Face of a Girl” that had brought him his first fame. In September the family returned to the Strata. The move was made a little earlier this year on account of Alice Greggory's wedding."

Then, after several sketches of trial poses, Bertram began his picture of Billy and the baby together. Even now Bertram was not sure of his work.
