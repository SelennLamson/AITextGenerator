Her home was a large, dull, tall one, in a large, dull square, where all the houses were alike, and all the sparrows were alike, and where all the door-knockers made the same heavy sound, and on still days--and nearly all the days were still--seemed to resound through the entire row in which the knock was knocked. On Miss Minchin's door there was a brass plate. On the brass plate there was inscribed in black letters, SELECT SEMINARY FOR YOUNG LADIESLittle Sara Crewe never went in or out of the house without reading that door-plate and reflecting upon it."}, {"size": 870, "text": "By the time she was twelve, she had decided that all her trouble arose because, in the first place, she was not \u201cSelect,\u201d and in the second she was not a \u201cYoung Lady.\u201d When she was eight years old, she had been brought to Miss Minchin as a pupil, and left with her. Her papa had brought her all the way from India. Her mamma had died when she was a baby, and her papa had kept her with him as long as he could. And then, finding the hot climate was making her very delicate, he had brought her to England and left her with Miss Minchin, to be part of the Select Seminary for Young Ladies. Sara, who had always been a sharp little child, who remembered things, recollected hearing him say that he had not a relative in the world whom he knew of, and so he was obliged to place her at a boarding-school, and he had heard Miss Minchin's establishment spoken of very highly."}, {"size": 781, "text": "The same day, he took Sara out and bought her a great many beautiful clothes--clothes so grand and rich that only a very young and inexperienced man would have bought them for a mite of a child who was to be brought up in a boarding-school. But the fact was that he was a rash, innocent young man, and very sad at the thought of parting with his little girl, who was all he had left to remind him of her beautiful mother, whom he had dearly loved. And he wished her to have everything the most fortunate little girl could have; and so, when the polite saleswomen in the shops said, \u201cHere is our very latest thing in hats, the plumes are exactly the same as those we sold to Lady Diana Sinclair yesterday,\u201d he immediately bought what was offered to him, and paid whatever was asked."}, {"size": 643, "text": "The consequence was that Sara had a most extraordinary wardrobe. Her dresses were silk and velvet and India cashmere, her hats and bonnets were covered with bows and plumes, her small undergarments were adorned with real lace, and she returned in the cab to Miss Minchin's with a doll almost as large as herself, dressed quite as grandly as herself, too. Then her papa gave Miss Minchin some money and went away, and for several days Sara would neither touch the doll, nor her breakfast, nor her dinner, nor her tea, and would do nothing but crouch in a small corner by the window and cry. She cried so much, indeed, that she made herself ill."}, {"size": 825, "text": "She was a queer little child, with old-fashioned ways and strong feelings, and she had adored her papa, and could not be made to think that India and an interesting bungalow were not better for her than London and Miss Minchin's Select Seminary. The instant she had entered the house, she had begun promptly to hate Miss Minchin, and to think little of Miss Amelia Minchin, who was smooth and dumpy, and lisped, and was evidently afraid of her older sister. Miss Minchin was tall, and had large, cold, fishy eyes, and large, cold hands, which seemed fishy, too, because they were damp and made chills run down Sara's back when they touched her, as Miss Minchin pushed her hair off her forehead and said: \u201cA most beautiful and promising little girl, Captain Crewe. She will be a favorite pupil; quite a favorite pupil, I see.\u201d"}, {"size": 747, "text": "For the first year she was a favorite pupil; at least she was indulged a great deal more than was good for her. And when the Select Seminary went walking, two by two, she was always decked out in her grandest clothes, and led by the hand at the head of the genteel procession, by Miss Minchin herself. And when the parents of any of the pupils came, she was always dressed and called into the parlor with her doll; and she used to hear Miss Minchin say that her father was a distinguished Indian officer, and she would be heiress to a great fortune. That her father had inherited a great deal of money, Sara had heard before; and also that some day it would be hers, and that he would not remain long in the army, but would come to live in London."}, {"size": 772, "text": "And every time a letter came, she hoped it would say he was coming, and they were to live together again. But about the middle of the third year a letter came bringing very different news. Because he was not a business man himself, her papa had given his affairs into the hands of a friend he trusted. The friend had deceived and robbed him. All the money was gone, no one knew exactly where, and the shock was so great to the poor, rash young officer, that, being attacked by jungle fever shortly afterward, he had no strength to rally, and so died, leaving Sara, with no one to take care of her. Miss Minchin's cold and fishy eyes had never looked so cold and fishy as they did when Sara went into the parlor, on being sent for, a few days after the letter was received."}, {"size": 645, "text": "No one had said anything to the child about mourning, so, in her old-fashioned way, she had decided to find a black dress for herself, and had picked out a black velvet she had outgrown, and came into the room in it, looking the queerest little figure in the world, and a sad little figure too. The dress was too short and too tight, her face was white, her eyes had dark rings around them, and her doll, wrapped in a piece of old black crape, was held under her arm. She was not a pretty child. She was thin, and had a weird, interesting little face, short black hair, and very large, green-gray eyes fringed all around with heavy black lashes."}, {"size": 611, "text": "\u201cI am the ugliest child in the school,\u201d she had said once, after staring at herself in the glass for some minutes. But there had been a clever, good-natured little French teacher who had said to the music-master: \u201cZat leetle Crewe. Vat a child! A so ogly beauty! Ze so large eyes! ze so little spirituelle face. Waid till she grow up. You shall see!\u201d This morning, however, in the tight, small black frock, she looked thinner and odder than ever, and her eyes were fixed on Miss Minchin with a queer steadiness as she slowly advanced into the parlor, clutching her doll. \u201cPut your doll down!\u201d said Miss Minchin."}, {"size": 675, "text": "\u201cNo,\u201d said the child, \u201cI won't put her down; I want her with me. She is all I have. She has stayed with me all the time since my papa died.\u201d She had never been an obedient child. She had had her own way ever since she was born, and there was about her an air of silent determination under which Miss Minchin had always felt secretly uncomfortable. And that lady felt even now that perhaps it would be as well not to insist on her point. So she looked at her as severely as possible. \u201cYou will have no time for dolls in future,\u201d she said; \u201cyou will have to work and improve yourself, and make yourself useful.\u201d Sara kept the big odd eyes fixed on her teacher and said nothing."}, {"size": 650, "text": "\u201cEverything will be very different now,\u201d Miss Minchin went on. \u201cI sent for you to talk to you and make you understand. Your father is dead. You have no friends. You have no money. You have no home and no one to take care of you.\u201d The little pale olive face twitched nervously, but the green-gray eyes did not move from Miss Minchin's, and still Sara said nothing. \u201cWhat are you staring at?\u201d demanded Miss Minchin sharply. \u201cAre you so stupid you don't understand what I mean? I tell you that you are quite alone in the world, and have no one to do anything for you, unless I choose to keep you here.\u201d The truth was, Miss Minchin was in her worst mood."}, {"size": 865, "text": "To be suddenly deprived of a large sum of money yearly and a show pupil, and to find herself with a little beggar on her hands, was more than she could bear with any degree of calmness. \u201cNow listen to me,\u201d she went on, \u201cand remember what I say. If you work hard and prepare to make yourself useful in a few years, I shall let you stay here. You are only a child, but you are a sharp child, and you pick up things almost without being taught. You speak French very well, and in a year or so you can begin to help with the younger pupils. By the time you are fifteen you ought to be able to do that much at least.\u201d \u201cI can speak French better than you, now,\u201d said Sara; \u201cI always spoke it with my papa in India.\u201d Which was not at all polite, but was painfully true; because Miss Minchin could not speak French at all, and, indeed, was not in the least a clever person."}, {"size": 561, "text": "But she was a hard, grasping business woman; and, after the first shock of disappointment, had seen that at very little expense to herself she might prepare this clever, determined child to be very useful to her and save her the necessity of paying large salaries to teachers of languages. \u201cDon't be impudent, or you will be punished,\u201d she said. \u201cYou will have to improve your manners if you expect to earn your bread. You are not a parlor boarder now. Remember that if you don't please me, and I send you away, you have no home but the street. You can go now.\u201d"}, {"size": 604, "text": "\u201cStay,\u201d commanded Miss Minchin, \u201cdon't you intend to thank me?\u201d Sara turned toward her. The nervous twitch was to be seen again in her face, and she seemed to be trying to control it. \u201cWhat for?\u201d she said. \u201cFor my kindness to you,\u201d replied Miss Minchin. \u201cFor my kindness in giving you a home.\u201d Sara went two or three steps nearer to her. Her thin little chest was heaving up and down, and she spoke in a strange, unchildish voice. \u201cYou are not kind,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are not kind.\u201d And she turned again and went out of the room, leaving Miss Minchin staring after her strange, small figure in stony anger."}, {"size": 692, "text": "The child walked up the staircase, holding tightly to her doll; she meant to go to her bedroom, but at the door she was met by Miss Amelia. \u201cYou are not to go in there,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is not your room now.\u201d \u201cWhere is my room?\u201d asked Sara. \u201cYou are to sleep in the attic next to the cook.\u201d Sara walked on. She mounted two flights more, and reached the door of the attic room, opened it and went in, shutting it behind her. She stood against it and looked about her. The room was slanting-roofed and whitewashed; there was a rusty grate, an iron bedstead, and some odd articles of furniture, sent up from better rooms below, where they had been used until they were considered to be worn out."}, {"size": 487, "text": "Under the skylight in the roof, which showed nothing but an oblong piece of dull gray sky, there was a battered old red footstool. Sara went to it and sat down. She was a queer child, as I have said before, and quite unlike other children. She seldom cried. She did not cry now. She laid her doll, Emily, across her knees, and put her face down upon her, and her arms around her, and sat there, her little black head resting on the black crape, not saying one word, not making one sound."}, {"size": 753, "text": "From that day her life changed entirely. Sometimes she used to feel as if it must be another life altogether, the life of some other child. She was a little drudge and outcast; she was given her lessons at odd times and expected to learn without being taught; she was sent on errands by Miss Minchin, Miss Amelia and the cook. Nobody took any notice of her except when they ordered her about. She was often kept busy all day and then sent into the deserted school-room with a pile of books to learn her lessons or practise at night. She had never been intimate with the other pupils, and soon she became so shabby that, taking her queer clothes together with her queer little ways, they began to look upon her as a being of another world than their own."}, {"size": 617, "text": "The fact was that, as a rule, Miss Minchin's pupils were rather dull, matter-of-fact young people, accustomed to being rich and comfortable; and Sara, with her elfish cleverness, her desolate life, and her odd habit of fixing her eyes upon them and staring them out of countenance, was too much for them. \u201cShe always looks as if she was finding you out,\u201d said one girl, who was sly and given to making mischief. \u201cI am,\u201d said Sara promptly, when she heard of it. \u201cThat's what I look at them for. I like to know about people. I think them over afterward.\u201d She never made any mischief herself or interfered with any one."}, {"size": 660, "text": "She talked very little, did as she was told, and thought a great deal. Nobody knew, and in fact nobody cared, whether she was unhappy or happy, unless, perhaps, it was Emily, who lived in the attic and slept on the iron bedstead at night. Sara thought Emily understood her feelings, though she was only wax and had a habit of staring herself. Sara used to talk to her at night. \u201cYou are the only friend I have in the world,\u201d she would say to her. \u201cWhy don't you say something? Why don't you speak? Sometimes I am sure you could, if you would try. It ought to make you try, to know you are the only thing I have. If I were you, I should try. Why don't you try?\u201d"}, {"size": 732, "text": "It really was a very strange feeling she had about Emily. It arose from her being so desolate. She did not like to own to herself that her only friend, her only companion, could feel and hear nothing. She wanted to believe, or to pretend to believe, that Emily understood and sympathized with her, that she heard her even though she did not speak in answer. She used to put her in a chair sometimes and sit opposite to her on the old red footstool, and stare at her and think and pretend about her until her own eyes would grow large with something which was almost like fear, particularly at night, when the garret was so still, when the only sound that was to be heard was the occasional squeak and scurry of rats in the wainscot."}, {"size": 713, "text": "There were rat-holes in the garret, and Sara detested rats, and was always glad Emily was with her when she heard their hateful squeak and rush and scratching. One of her \u201cpretends\u201d was that Emily was a kind of good witch and could protect her. Poor little Sara! everything was \u201cpretend\u201d with her. She had a strong imagination; there was almost more imagination than there was Sara, and her whole forlorn, uncared-for child-life was made up of imaginings. She imagined and pretended things until she almost believed them, and she would scarcely have been surprised at any remarkable thing that could have happened. So she insisted to herself that Emily understood all about her troubles and was really her friend."}, {"size": 780, "text": "\u201cAs to answering,\u201d she used to say, \u201cI don't answer very often. I never answer when I can help it. When people are insulting you, there is nothing so good for them as not to say a word--just to look at them and think. Miss Minchin turns pale with rage when I do it. Miss Amelia looks frightened, so do the girls. They know you are stronger than they are, because you are strong enough to hold in your rage and they are not, and they say stupid things they wish they hadn't said afterward. There's nothing so strong as rage, except what makes you hold it in--that's stronger. It's a good thing not to answer your enemies. I scarcely ever do. Perhaps Emily is more like me than I am like myself. Perhaps she would rather not answer her friends, even. She keeps it all in her heart.\u201d"}, {"size": 751, "text": "But though she tried to satisfy herself with these arguments, Sara did not find it easy. When, after a long, hard day, in which she had been sent here and there, sometimes on long errands, through wind and cold and rain; and, when she came in wet and hungry, had been sent out again because nobody chose to remember that she was only a child, and that her thin little legs might be tired, and her small body, clad in its forlorn, too small finery, all too short and too tight, might be chilled; when she had been given only harsh words and cold, slighting looks for thanks, when the cook had been vulgar and insolent; when Miss Minchin had been in her worst moods, and when she had seen the girls sneering at her among themselves and making fun of her"}, {"size": 454, "text": "poor, outgrown clothes--then Sara did not find Emily quite all that her sore, proud, desolate little heart needed as the doll sat in her little old chair and stared. One of these nights, when she came up to the garret cold, hungry, tired, and with a tempest raging in her small breast, Emily's stare seemed so vacant, her sawdust legs and arms so limp and inexpressive, that Sara lost all control over herself. \u201cI shall die presently!\u201d she said at first."}, {"size": 665, "text": "\u201cI can't bear this!\u201d said the poor child, trembling. \u201cI know I shall die. I'm cold, I'm wet, I'm starving to death. I've walked a thousand miles to-day, and they have done nothing but scold me from morning until night. And because I could not find that last thing they sent me for, they would not give me any supper. Some men laughed at me because my old shoes made me slip down in the mud. I'm covered with mud now. And they laughed! Do you hear!\u201d She looked at the staring glass eyes and complacent wax face, and suddenly a sort of heartbroken rage seized her. She lifted her little savage hand and knocked Emily off the chair, bursting into a passion of sobbing."}, {"size": 738, "text": "\u201cYou are nothing but a doll!\u201d she cried. \u201cNothing but a doll-doll-doll! You care for nothing. You are stuffed with sawdust. You never had a heart. Nothing could ever make you feel. You are a doll!\u201d Emily lay upon the floor, with her legs ignominiously doubled up over her head, and a new flat place on the end of her nose; but she was still calm, even dignified. Sara hid her face on her arms and sobbed. Some rats in the wall began to fight and bite each other, and squeak and scramble. But, as I have already intimated, Sara was not in the habit of crying. After a while she stopped, and when she stopped she looked at Emily, who seemed to be gazing at her around the side of one ankle, and actually with a kind of glassy-eyed sympathy."}, {"size": 633, "text": "Sara bent and picked her up. Remorse overtook her. \u201cYou can't help being a doll,\u201d she said, with a resigned sigh, \u201cany more than those girls downstairs can help not having any sense. We are not all alike. Perhaps you do your sawdust best.\u201d None of Miss Minchin's young ladies were very remarkable for being brilliant; they were select, but some of them were very dull, and some of them were fond of applying themselves to their lessons. Sara, who snatched her lessons at all sorts of untimely hours from tattered and discarded books, and who had a hungry craving for everything readable, was often severe upon them in her small mind."}, {"size": 648, "text": "They had books they never read; she had no books at all. If she had always had something to read, she would not have been so lonely. She liked romances and history and poetry; she would read anything. There was a sentimental housemaid in the establishment who bought the weekly penny papers, and subscribed to a circulating library, from which she got greasy volumes containing stories of marquises and dukes who invariably fell in love with orange-girls and gypsies and servant-maids, and made them the proud brides of coronets; and Sara often did parts of this maid's work so that she might earn the privilege of reading these romantic histories."}, {"size": 654, "text": "There was also a fat, dull pupil, whose name was Ermengarde St. John, who was one of her resources. Ermengarde had an intellectual father, who, in his despairing desire to encourage his daughter, constantly sent her valuable and interesting books, which were a continual source of grief to her. Sara had once actually found her crying over a big package of them. \u201cWhat is the matter with you?\u201d she asked her, perhaps rather disdainfully. And it is just possible she would not have spoken to her, if she had not seen the books. The sight of books always gave Sara a hungry feeling, and she could not help drawing near to them if only to read their titles."}, {"size": 621, "text": "\u201cWhat is the matter with you?\u201d she asked. \u201cMy papa has sent me some more books,\u201d answered Ermengarde woefully, \u201cand he expects me to read them.\u201d \u201cDon't you like reading?\u201d said Sara. \u201cI hate it!\u201d replied Miss Ermengarde St. John. \u201cAnd he will ask me questions when he sees me: he will want to know how much I remember; how would you like to have to read all those?\u201d \u201cI'd like it better than anything else in the world,\u201d said Sara. Ermengarde wiped her eyes to look at such a prodigy. \u201cOh, gracious!\u201d she exclaimed. Sara returned the look with interest. A sudden plan formed itself in her sharp mind. \u201cLook here!\u201d she said."}, {"size": 649, "text": "\u201cIf you'll lend me those books, I'll read them and tell you everything that's in them afterward, and I'll tell it to you so that you will remember it.

I'll take care of the books, too; they will look just as new as they do now, when I give them back to you.\u201d Ermengarde put her handkerchief in her pocket. \u201cIf you'll do that,\u201d she said, \u201cand if you'll make me remember, I'll give you--I'll give you some money.\u201d \u201cI don't want your money,\u201d said Sara."}, {"size": 630, "text": "\u201cI want your books--I want them.\u201d And her eyes grew big and queer, and her chest heaved once. \u201cTake them, then,\u201d said Ermengarde; \u201cI wish I wanted them, but I am not clever, and my father is, and he thinks I ought to be.\u201d Sara picked up the books and marched off with them. But when she was at the door, she stopped and turned around. \u201cWhat are you going to tell your father?\u201d she asked. \u201cOh,\u201d said Ermengarde, \u201che needn't know; he'll think I've read them.\u201d Sara looked down at the books; her heart really began to beat fast. \u201cI won't do it,\u201d she said rather slowly, \u201cif you are going to tell him lies about it--I don't like lies."}, {"size": 827, "text": "Why can't you tell him I read them and then told you about them?\u201d \u201cBut he wants me to read them,\u201d said Ermengarde. \u201cHe wants you to know what is in them,\u201d said Sara; \u201cand if I can tell it to you in an easy way and make you remember, I should think he would like that.\u201d \u201cHe would like it better if I read them myself,\u201d replied Ermengarde. \u201cHe will like it, I dare say, if you learn anything in any way,\u201d said Sara. \u201cI should, if I were your father.\u201d And though this was not a flattering way of stating the case, Ermengarde was obliged to admit it was true, and, after a little more argument, gave in. And so she used afterward always to hand over her books to Sara, and Sara would carry them to her garret and devour them; and after she had read each volume, she would return it and tell Ermengarde about it in a way of her own."}, {"size": 638, "text": "She had a gift for making things interesting. Her imagination helped her to make everything rather like a story, and she managed this matter so well that Miss St. John gained more information from her books than she would have gained if she had read them three times over by her poor stupid little self. When Sara sat down by her and began to tell some story of travel or history, she made the travellers and historical people seem real; and Ermengarde used to sit and regard her dramatic gesticulations, her thin little flushed cheeks, and her shining, odd eyes with amazement. \u201cIt sounds nicer than it seems in the book,\u201d she would say."}, {"size": 480, "text": "\u201cI never cared about Mary, Queen of Scots, before, and I always hated the French Revolution, but you make it seem like a story.\u201d \u201cIt is a story,\u201d Sara would answer. \u201cThey are all stories. Everything is a story--everything in this world. You are a story--I am a story--Miss Minchin is a story. You can make a story out of anything.\u201d \u201cI can't,\u201d said Ermengarde.

She knew she was sometimes rather impolite in the candor of her remarks, and she did not want to be impolite to a girl who was not unkind--only stupid. Notwithstanding all her sharp little ways she had the sense to wish to be just to everybody. In the hours she spent alone, she used to argue out a great many curious questions with herself. One thing she had decided upon was, that a person who was clever ought to be clever enough not to be unjust or deliberately unkind to any one. Miss Minchin was unjust and cruel, Miss Amelia was unkind and spiteful, the cook was malicious and hasty-tempered--they all were stupid, and made her despise them, and she desired to be as unlike them as possible."}, {"size": 719, "text": "So she would be as polite as she could to people who in the least deserved politeness. \u201cEmily is--a person--I know,\u201d she replied. \u201cDo you like her?\u201d asked Ermengarde. \u201cYes, I do,\u201d said Sara. Ermengarde examined her queer little face and figure again. She did look odd. She had on, that day, a faded blue plush skirt, which barely covered her knees, a brown Cloth sacque, and a pair of olive-green stockings which Miss Minchin had made her piece out with black ones, so that they would be long enough to be kept on. And yet Ermengarde was beginning slowly to admire her. Such a forlorn, thin, neglected little thing as that, who could read and read and remember and tell you things so that they did not tire you all out!"}, {"size": 626, "text": "A child who could speak French, and who had learned German, no one knew how! One could not help staring at her and feeling interested, particularly one to whom the simplest lesson was a trouble and a woe. \u201cDo you like me?\u201d said Ermengarde, finally, at the end of her scrutiny. Sara hesitated one second, then she answered: \u201cI like you because you are not ill-natured--I like you for letting me read your books--I like you because you don't make spiteful fun of me for what I can't help. It's not your fault that--\u201d She pulled herself up quickly. She had been going to say, \u201cthat you are stupid.\u201d \u201cThat what?\u201d asked Ermengarde."}, {"size": 658, "text": "\u201cThat you can't learn things quickly. If you can't, you can't. If I can, why, I can--that's all.\u201d She paused a minute, looking at the plump face before her, and then, rather slowly, one of her wise, old-fashioned thoughts came to her. \u201cPerhaps,\u201d she said, \u201cto be able to learn things quickly isn't everything. To be kind is worth a good deal to other people. If Miss Minchin knew everything on earth, which she doesn't, and if she was like what she is now, she'd still be a detestable thing, and everybody would hate her.

She really cried more at this strange thought of having a friend--even though an unknown one--than she had cried over many of her worst troubles.

It was just like Sara, that, once having found the things real, she should give herself up to the enjoyment of them to the very utmost.

Sometimes she found new flowers in her room; sometimes a fanciful little gift tucked into some odd corner, sometimes a new book on her pillow;--once as they sat together in the"}, {"size": 695, "text": "evening they heard the scratch of a heavy paw on the door of the room, and when Sara went to find out what it was, there stood a great dog--a splendid Russian boar-hound with a grand silver and gold collar. Stooping to read the inscription upon the collar, Sara was delighted to read the words: \u201cI am Boris; I serve the Princess Sara.\u201d Then there was a sort of fairy nursery arranged for the entertainment of the juvenile members of the Large Family, who were always coming to see Sara and the Lascar and the monkey. Sara was as fond of the Large Family as they were of her. She soon felt as if she were a member of it, and the companionship of the healthy, happy children was very good for her."}, {"size": 731, "text": "All the children rather looked up to her and regarded her as the cleverest and most brilliant of creatures--particularly after it was discovered that she not only knew stories of every kind, and could invent new ones at a moment's notice, but that she could help with lessons, and speak French and German, and discourse with the Lascar in Hindustani. It was rather a painful experience for Miss Minchin to watch her ex-pupil's fortunes, as she had the daily opportunity to do, and to feel that she had made a serious mistake, from a business point of view. She had even tried to retrieve it by suggesting that Sara's education should be continued under her care, and had gone to the length of making an appeal to the child herself."}, {"size": 612, "text": "\u201cI have always been very fond of you,\u201d she said.

She merely sent in a bill for the expense of Sara's education and support, and she made it quite large enough. And because Mr. Carrisford thought Sara would wish it paid, it was paid. When Mr. Carmichael paid it he had a brief interview with Miss Minchin in which he expressed his opinion with much clearness and force; and it is quite certain that Miss Minchin did not enjoy the conversation. Sara had been about a month with Mr. Carrisford, and had begun to realize that her happiness was not a dream, when one night the Indian Gentleman saw that she sat a long time with her cheek on her hand looking at the fire."}, {"size": 683, "text": "\u201cWhat are you `supposing,' Sara?\u201d he asked.

Try to forget it. Come and sit on this footstool near my knee, and only remember you are a princess.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Sara, \u201cand I can give buns and bread to the Populace.\u201d And she went and sat on the stool, and the Indian Gentleman (he used to like her to call him that, too, sometimes,--in fact very often) drew her small, dark head down upon his knee and stroked her hair.
