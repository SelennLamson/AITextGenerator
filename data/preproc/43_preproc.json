JEKYLL WAS QUITE AT EASE THE CAREW MURDER CASE INCIDENT OF THE LETTER INCIDENT OF DR. LANYON INCIDENT AT THE WINDOW DR. LANYON\u2019S NARRATIVE HENRY JEKYLL\u2019S FULL STATEMENT OF THE CASEMr. Utterson the lawyer was a man of a rugged countenance that was never lighted by a smile; cold, scanty and embarrassed in discourse; backward in sentiment; lean, long, dusty, dreary and yet somehow lovable. At friendly meetings, and when the wine was to his taste, something eminently human beaconed from his eye; something indeed which never found its way into his talk, but which spoke not only in these silent symbols of the after-dinner face, but more often and loudly in the acts of his life."}, {"size": 749, "text": "He was austere with himself; drank gin when he was alone, to mortify a taste for vintages; and though he enjoyed the theatre, had not crossed the doors of one for twenty years. But he had an approved tolerance for others; sometimes wondering, almost with envy, at the high pressure of spirits involved in their misdeeds; and in any extremity inclined to help rather than to reprove. \u201cI incline to Cain\u2019s heresy,\u201d he used to say quaintly: \u201cI let my brother go to the devil in his own way.\u201d In this character, it was frequently his fortune to be the last reputable acquaintance and the last good influence in the lives of downgoing men. And to such as these, so long as they came about his chambers, he never marked a shade of change in his demeanour."}, {"size": 705, "text": "No doubt the feat was easy to Mr. Utterson; for he was undemonstrative at the best, and even his friendship seemed to be founded in a similar catholicity of good-nature. It is the mark of a modest man to accept his friendly circle ready-made from the hands of opportunity; and that was the lawyer\u2019s way. His friends were those of his own blood or those whom he had known the longest; his affections, like ivy, were the growth of time, they implied no aptness in the object. Hence, no doubt the bond that united him to Mr. Richard Enfield, his distant kinsman, the well-known man about town. It was a nut to crack for many, what these two could see in each other, or what subject they could find in common."}, {"size": 619, "text": "It was reported by those who encountered them in their Sunday walks, that they said nothing, looked singularly dull and would hail with obvious relief the appearance of a friend. For all that, the two men put the greatest store by these excursions, counted them the chief jewel of each week, and not only set aside occasions of pleasure, but even resisted the calls of business, that they might enjoy them uninterrupted. It chanced on one of these rambles that their way led them down a by-street in a busy quarter of London. The street was small and what is called quiet, but it drove a thriving trade on the weekdays."}, {"size": 602, "text": "The inhabitants were all doing well, it seemed and all emulously hoping to do better still, and laying out the surplus of their grains in coquetry; so that the shop fronts stood along that thoroughfare with an air of invitation, like rows of smiling saleswomen. Even on Sunday, when it veiled its more florid charms and lay comparatively empty of passage, the street shone out in contrast to its dingy neighbourhood, like a fire in a forest; and with its freshly painted shutters, well-polished brasses, and general cleanliness and gaiety of note, instantly caught and pleased the eye of the passenger."}, {"size": 766, "text": "Two doors from one corner, on the left hand going east the line was broken by the entry of a court; and just at that point a certain sinister block of building thrust forward its gable on the street. It was two storeys high; showed no window, nothing but a door on the lower storey and a blind forehead of discoloured wall on the upper; and bore in every feature, the marks of prolonged and sordid negligence. The door, which was equipped with neither bell nor knocker, was blistered and distained. Tramps slouched into the recess and struck matches on the panels; children kept shop upon the steps; the schoolboy had tried his knife on the mouldings; and for close on a generation, no one had appeared to drive away these random visitors or to repair their ravages."}, {"size": 643, "text": "Mr. Enfield and the lawyer were on the other side of the by-street; but when they came abreast of the entry, the former lifted up his cane and pointed. \u201cDid you ever remark that door?\u201d he asked; and when his companion had replied in the affirmative, \u201cIt is connected in my mind,\u201d added he, \u201cwith a very odd story.\u201d \u201cIndeed?\u201d said Mr. Utterson, with a slight change of voice, \u201cand what was that?\u201d \u201cWell, it was this way,\u201d returned Mr. Enfield: \u201cI was coming home from some place at the end of the world, about three o\u2019clock of a black winter morning, and my way lay through a part of town where there was literally nothing to be seen but lamps."}, {"size": 662, "text": "Street after street and all the folks asleep\u2014street after street, all lighted up as if for a procession and all as empty as a church\u2014till at last I got into that state of mind when a man listens and listens and begins to long for the sight of a policeman. All at once, I saw two figures: one a little man who was stumping along eastward at a good walk, and the other a girl of maybe eight or ten who was running as hard as she was able down a cross street. Well, sir, the two ran into one another naturally enough at the corner; and then came the horrible part of the thing; for the man trampled calmly over the child\u2019s body and left her screaming on the ground."}, {"size": 666, "text": "It sounds nothing to hear, but it was hellish to see. It wasn\u2019t like a man; it was like some damned Juggernaut. I gave a few halloa, took to my heels, collared my gentleman, and brought him back to where there was already quite a group about the screaming child. He was perfectly cool and made no resistance, but gave me one look, so ugly that it brought out the sweat on me like running. The people who had turned out were the girl\u2019s own family; and pretty soon, the doctor, for whom she had been sent put in his appearance. Well, the child was not much the worse, more frightened, according to the sawbones; and there you might have supposed would be an end to it."}, {"size": 732, "text": "But there was one curious circumstance. I had taken a loathing to my gentleman at first sight. So had the child\u2019s family, which was only natural. But the doctor\u2019s case was what struck me. He was the usual cut and dry apothecary, of no particular age and colour, with a strong Edinburgh accent and about as emotional as a bagpipe. Well, sir, he was like the rest of us; every time he looked at my prisoner, I saw that sawbones turn sick and white with the desire to kill him. I knew what was in his mind, just as he knew what was in mine; and killing being out of the question, we did the next best. We told the man we could and would make such a scandal out of this as should make his name stink from one end of London to the other."}, {"size": 770, "text": "If he had any friends or any credit, we undertook that he should lose them. And all the time, as we were pitching it in red hot, we were keeping the women off him as best we could for they were as wild as harpies. I never saw a circle of such hateful faces; and there was the man in the middle, with a kind of black sneering coolness\u2014frightened too, I could see that\u2014but carrying it off, sir, really like Satan. \u2018If you choose to make capital out of this accident,\u2019 said he, \u2018I am naturally helpless. No gentleman but wishes to avoid a scene,\u2019 says he. \u2018Name your figure.\u2019 Well, we screwed him up to a hundred pounds for the child\u2019s family; he would have clearly liked to stick out; but there was something about the lot of us that meant mischief, and at last he struck."}, {"size": 756, "text": "The next thing was to get the money; and where do you think he carried us but to that place with the door?\u2014whipped out a key, went in, and presently came back with the matter of ten pounds in gold and a cheque for the balance on Coutts\u2019s, drawn payable to bearer and signed with a name that I can\u2019t mention, though it\u2019s one of the points of my story, but it was a name at least very well known and often printed. The figure was stiff; but the signature was good for more than that if it was only genuine. I took the liberty of pointing out to my gentleman that the whole business looked apocryphal, and that a man does not, in real life, walk into a cellar door at four in the morning and come out with another man\u2019s cheque for close upon a hundred pounds."}, {"size": 809, "text": "But he was quite easy and sneering. \u2018Set your mind at rest,\u2019 says he, \u2018I will stay with you till the banks open and cash the cheque myself.\u2019 So we all set off, the doctor, and the child\u2019s father, and our friend and myself, and passed the rest of the night in my chambers; and next day, when we had breakfasted, went in a body to the bank. I gave in the cheque myself, and said I had every reason to believe it was a forgery. Not a bit of it. The cheque was genuine.\u201d \u201cTut-tut!\u201d said Mr. Utterson. \u201cI see you feel as I do,\u201d said Mr. Enfield. \u201cYes, it\u2019s a bad story. For my man was a fellow that nobody could have to do with, a really damnable man; and the person that drew the cheque is the very pink of the proprieties, celebrated too, and (what makes it worse) one of your fellows who do what they call good."}, {"size": 601, "text": "Blackmail, I suppose; an honest man paying through the nose for some of the capers of his youth. Black Mail House is what I call the place with the door, in consequence. Though even that, you know, is far from explaining all,\u201d he added, and with the words fell into a vein of musing. From this he was recalled by Mr. Utterson asking rather suddenly: \u201cAnd you don\u2019t know if the drawer of the cheque lives there?\u201d \u201cA likely place, isn\u2019t it?\u201d returned Mr. Enfield. \u201cBut I happen to have noticed his address; he lives in some square or other.\u201d \u201cAnd you never asked about the\u2014place with the door?\u201d said Mr."}, {"size": 638, "text": "Utterson. \u201cNo, sir; I had a delicacy,\u201d was the reply. \u201cI feel very strongly about putting questions; it partakes too much of the style of the day of judgment. You start a question, and it\u2019s like starting a stone. You sit quietly on the top of a hill; and away the stone goes, starting others; and presently some bland old bird (the last you would have thought of) is knocked on the head in his own back garden and the family have to change their name. No sir, I make it a rule of mine: the more it looks like Queer Street, the less I ask.\u201d \u201cA very good rule, too,\u201d said the lawyer. \u201cBut I have studied the place for myself,\u201d continued Mr."}, {"size": 667, "text": "Enfield. \u201cIt seems scarcely a house. There is no other door, and nobody goes in or out of that one but, once in a great while, the gentleman of my adventure. There are three windows looking on the court on the first floor; none below; the windows are always shut but they\u2019re clean. And then there is a chimney which is generally smoking; so somebody must live there. And yet it\u2019s not so sure; for the buildings are so packed together about the court, that it\u2019s hard to say where one ends and another begins.\u201d The pair walked on again for a while in silence; and then \u201cEnfield,\u201d said Mr. Utterson, \u201cthat\u2019s a good rule of yours.\u201d \u201cYes, I think it is,\u201d returned Enfield."}, {"size": 681, "text": "\u201cBut for all that,\u201d continued the lawyer, \u201cthere\u2019s one point I want to ask. I want to ask the name of that man who walked over the child.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Mr. Enfield, \u201cI can\u2019t see what harm it would do. It was a man of the name of Hyde.\u201d \u201cHm,\u201d said Mr. Utterson. \u201cWhat sort of a man is he to see?\u201d \u201cHe is not easy to describe. There is something wrong with his appearance; something displeasing, something down-right detestable. I never saw a man I so disliked, and yet I scarce know why. He must be deformed somewhere; he gives a strong feeling of deformity, although I couldn\u2019t specify the point. He\u2019s an extraordinary looking man, and yet I really can name nothing out of the way."}, {"size": 676, "text": "No, sir; I can make no hand of it; I can\u2019t describe him. And it\u2019s not want of memory; for I declare I can see him this moment.\u201d Mr. Utterson again walked some way in silence and obviously under a weight of consideration. \u201cYou are sure he used a key?\u201d he inquired at last. \u201cMy dear sir...\u201d began Enfield, surprised out of himself. \u201cYes, I know,\u201d said Utterson; \u201cI know it must seem strange. The fact is, if I do not ask you the name of the other party, it is because I know it already. You see, Richard, your tale has gone home. If you have been inexact in any point you had better correct it.\u201d \u201cI think you might have warned me,\u201d returned the other with a touch of sullenness."}, {"size": 437, "text": "\u201cBut I have been pedantically exact, as you call it. The fellow had a key; and what\u2019s more, he has it still. I saw him use it not a week ago.\u201d Mr. Utterson sighed deeply but said never a word; and the young man presently resumed. \u201cHere is another lesson to say nothing,\u201d said he. \u201cI am ashamed of my long tongue. Let us make a bargain never to refer to this again.\u201d \u201cWith all my heart,\u201d said the lawyer. \u201cI shake hands on that, Richard.\u201d"}, {"size": 657, "text": "That evening Mr. Utterson came home to his bachelor house in sombre spirits and sat down to dinner without relish. It was his custom of a Sunday, when this meal was over, to sit close by the fire, a volume of some dry divinity on his reading desk, until the clock of the neighbouring church rang out the hour of twelve, when he would go soberly and gratefully to bed. On this night however, as soon as the cloth was taken away, he took up a candle and went into his business room. There he opened his safe, took from the most private part of it a document endorsed on the envelope as Dr. Jekyll\u2019s Will and sat down with a clouded brow to study its contents."}, {"size": 678, "text": "The will was holograph, for Mr. Utterson though he took charge of it now that it was made, had refused to lend the least assistance in the making of it; it provided not only that, in case of the decease of Henry Jekyll, M.D., D.C.L., L.L.D., F.R.S., etc., all his possessions were to pass into the hands of his \u201cfriend and benefactor Edward Hyde,\u201d but that in case of Dr. Jekyll\u2019s \u201cdisappearance or unexplained absence for any period exceeding three calendar months,\u201d the said Edward Hyde should step into the said Henry Jekyll\u2019s shoes without further delay and free from any burthen or obligation beyond the payment of a few small sums to the members of the doctor\u2019s household."}, {"size": 604, "text": "This document had long been the lawyer\u2019s eyesore. It offended him both as a lawyer and as a lover of the sane and customary sides of life, to whom the fanciful was the immodest. And hitherto it was his ignorance of Mr. Hyde that had swelled his indignation; now, by a sudden turn, it was his knowledge. It was already bad enough when the name was but a name of which he could learn no more. It was worse when it began to be clothed upon with detestable attributes; and out of the shifting, insubstantial mists that had so long baffled his eye, there leaped up the sudden, definite presentment of a fiend."}, {"size": 710, "text": "\u201cI thought it was madness,\u201d he said, as he replaced the obnoxious paper in the safe, \u201cand now I begin to fear it is disgrace.\u201d With that he blew out his candle, put on a greatcoat, and set forth in the direction of Cavendish Square, that citadel of medicine, where his friend, the great Dr. Lanyon, had his house and received his crowding patients. \u201cIf anyone knows, it will be Lanyon,\u201d he had thought. The solemn butler knew and welcomed him; he was subjected to no stage of delay, but ushered direct from the door to the dining-room where Dr. Lanyon sat alone over his wine. This was a hearty, healthy, dapper, red-faced gentleman, with a shock of hair prematurely white, and a boisterous and decided manner."}, {"size": 661, "text": "At sight of Mr. Utterson, he sprang up from his chair and welcomed him with both hands. The geniality, as was the way of the man, was somewhat theatrical to the eye; but it reposed on genuine feeling. For these two were old friends, old mates both at school and college, both thorough respectors of themselves and of each other, and what does not always follow, men who thoroughly enjoyed each other\u2019s company. After a little rambling talk, the lawyer led up to the subject which so disagreeably preoccupied his mind. \u201cI suppose, Lanyon,\u201d said he, \u201cyou and I must be the two oldest friends that Henry Jekyll has?\u201d \u201cI wish the friends were younger,\u201d chuckled Dr."}, {"size": 607, "text": "Lanyon. \u201cBut I suppose we are. And what of that? I see little of him now.\u201d \u201cIndeed?\u201d said Utterson. \u201cI thought you had a bond of common interest.\u201d \u201cWe had,\u201d was the reply. \u201cBut it is more than ten years since Henry Jekyll became too fanciful for me. He began to go wrong, wrong in mind; and though of course I continue to take an interest in him for old sake\u2019s sake, as they say, I see and I have seen devilish little of the man. Such unscientific balderdash,\u201d added the doctor, flushing suddenly purple, \u201cwould have estranged Damon and Pythias.\u201d This little spirit of temper was somewhat of a relief to Mr."}, {"size": 735, "text": "Utterson. \u201cThey have only differed on some point of science,\u201d he thought; and being a man of no scientific passions (except in the matter of conveyancing), he even added: \u201cIt is nothing worse than that!\u201d He gave his friend a few seconds to recover his composure, and then approached the question he had come to put. \u201cDid you ever come across a _prot\u00e9g\u00e9_ of his\u2014one Hyde?\u201d he asked. \u201cHyde?\u201d repeated Lanyon. \u201cNo. Never heard of him. Since my time.\u201d That was the amount of information that the lawyer carried back with him to the great, dark bed on which he tossed to and fro, until the small hours of the morning began to grow large. It was a night of little ease to his toiling mind, toiling in mere darkness and besieged by questions."}, {"size": 688, "text": "Six o\u2019clock struck on the bells of the church that was so conveniently near to Mr. Utterson\u2019s dwelling, and still he was digging at the problem. Hitherto it had touched him on the intellectual side alone; but now his imagination also was engaged, or rather enslaved; and as he lay and tossed in the gross darkness of the night and the curtained room, Mr. Enfield\u2019s tale went by before his mind in a scroll of lighted pictures. He would be aware of the great field of lamps of a nocturnal city; then of the figure of a man walking swiftly; then of a child running from the doctor\u2019s; and then these met, and that human Juggernaut trod the child down and passed on regardless of her screams."}, {"size": 698, "text": "Or else he would see a room in a rich house, where his friend lay asleep, dreaming and smiling at his dreams; and then the door of that room would be opened, the curtains of the bed plucked apart, the sleeper recalled, and lo! there would stand by his side a figure to whom power was given, and even at that dead hour, he must rise and do its bidding. The figure in these two phases haunted the lawyer all night; and if at any time he dozed over, it was but to see it glide more stealthily through sleeping houses, or move the more swiftly and still the more swiftly, even to dizziness, through wider labyrinths of lamplighted city, and at every street corner crush a child and leave her screaming."}, {"size": 628, "text": "And still the figure had no face by which he might know it; even in his dreams, it had no face, or one that baffled him and melted before his eyes; and thus it was that there sprang up and grew apace in the lawyer\u2019s mind a singularly strong, almost an inordinate, curiosity to behold the features of the real Mr. Hyde. If he could but once set eyes on him, he thought the mystery would lighten and perhaps roll altogether away, as was the habit of mysterious things when well examined. He might see a reason for his friend\u2019s strange preference or bondage (call it which you please) and even for the startling clause of the will."}, {"size": 641, "text": "At least it would be a face worth seeing: the face of a man who was without bowels of mercy: a face which had but to show itself to raise up, in the mind of the unimpressionable Enfield, a spirit of enduring hatred. From that time forward, Mr. Utterson began to haunt the door in the by-street of shops. In the morning before office hours, at noon when business was plenty and time scarce, at night under the face of the fogged city moon, by all lights and at all hours of solitude or concourse, the lawyer was to be found on his chosen post. \u201cIf he be Mr. Hyde,\u201d he had thought, \u201cI shall be Mr. Seek.\u201d And at last his patience was rewarded."}, {"size": 604, "text": "It was a fine dry night; frost in the air; the streets as clean as a ballroom floor; the lamps, unshaken by any wind, drawing a regular pattern of light and shadow. By ten o\u2019clock, when the shops were closed, the by-street was very solitary and, in spite of the low growl of London from all round, very silent. Small sounds carried far; domestic sounds out of the houses were clearly audible on either side of the roadway; and the rumour of the approach of any passenger preceded him by a long time. Mr. Utterson had been some minutes at his post, when he was aware of an odd light footstep drawing near."}, {"size": 620, "text": "In the course of his nightly patrols, he had long grown accustomed to the quaint effect with which the footfalls of a single person, while he is still a great way off, suddenly spring out distinct from the vast hum and clatter of the city. Yet his attention had never before been so sharply and decisively arrested; and it was with a strong, superstitious prevision of success that he withdrew into the entry of the court. The steps drew swiftly nearer, and swelled out suddenly louder as they turned the end of the street. The lawyer, looking forth from the entry, could soon see what manner of man he had to deal with."}, {"size": 626, "text": "He was small and very plainly dressed and the look of him, even at that distance, went somehow strongly against the watcher\u2019s inclination. But he made straight for the door, crossing the roadway to save time; and as he came, he drew a key from his pocket like one approaching home. Mr. Utterson stepped out and touched him on the shoulder as he passed. \u201cMr. Hyde, I think?\u201d Mr. Hyde shrank back with a hissing intake of the breath. But his fear was only momentary; and though he did not look the lawyer in the face, he answered coolly enough: \u201cThat is my name. What do you want?\u201d \u201cI see you are going in,\u201d returned the lawyer."}, {"size": 680, "text": "\u201cI am an old friend of Dr. Jekyll\u2019s\u2014Mr. Utterson of Gaunt Street\u2014you must have heard of my name; and meeting you so conveniently, I thought you might admit me.\u201d \u201cYou will not find Dr. Jekyll; he is from home,\u201d replied Mr. Hyde, blowing in the key. And then suddenly, but still without looking up, \u201cHow did you know me?\u201d he asked. \u201cOn your side,\u201d said Mr. Utterson \u201cwill you do me a favour?\u201d \u201cWith pleasure,\u201d replied the other. \u201cWhat shall it be?\u201d \u201cWill you let me see your face?\u201d asked the lawyer.

Mr. Hyde was pale and dwarfish, he gave an impression of deformity without any nameable malformation, he had a displeasing smile, he had borne himself to the lawyer with a sort of murderous mixture of timidity and boldness, and he spoke with a husky, whispering and somewhat broken voice; all these were points against him, but not all of these together could explain the hitherto unknown disgust, loathing and fear with which Mr. Utterson regarded him. \u201cThere must be something else,\u201d said the perplexed gentleman."}, {"size": 704, "text": "\u201cThere _is_ something more, if I could find a name for it.

Certain agents I found to have the power to shake and pluck back that fleshly vestment, even as a wind might toss the curtains of a pavilion. For two good reasons, I will not enter deeply into this scientific branch of my confession.

I hesitated long before I put this theory to the test of practice.

I knew myself, at the first breath of this new life, to be more wicked, tenfold more wicked, sold a slave to my original evil; and the thought, in that moment, braced and delighted me like wine.

I crossed the yard, wherein the constellations looked down upon me, I could have thought, with wonder, the first creature of that sort that their unsleeping vigilance had yet disclosed to them; I stole through the corridors, a stranger in my own house; and coming to my room, I saw for the first time the appearance of Edward Hyde."}, {"size": 664, "text": "I must here speak by theory alone, saying not that which I know, but that which I suppose to be most probable.

In my eyes it bore a livelier image of the spirit, it seemed more express and single, than the imperfect and divided countenance I had been hitherto accustomed to call mine.

The drug had no discriminating action; it was neither diabolical nor divine; it but shook the doors of the prisonhouse of my disposition; and like the captives of Philippi, that which stood within ran forth. At that time my virtue slumbered; my evil, kept awake by ambition, was alert and swift to seize the occasion; and the thing that was projected was Edward Hyde."}, {"size": 619, "text": "Hence, although I had now two characters as well as two appearances, one was wholly evil, and the other was still the old Henry Jekyll, that incongruous compound of whose reformation and improvement I had already learned to despair.

I would still be merrily disposed at times; and as my pleasures were (to say the least) undignified, and I was not only well known and highly considered, but growing towards the elderly man, this incoherency of my life was daily growing more unwelcome."}, {"size": 742, "text": "It was on this side that my new power tempted me until I fell in slavery.

I took and furnished that house in Soho, to which Hyde was tracked by the police; and engaged as a housekeeper a creature whom I knew well to be silent and unscrupulous. On the other side, I announced to my servants that a Mr. Hyde (whom I described) was to have full liberty and power about my house in the square; and to parry mishaps, I even called and made myself a familiar object, in my second character."}, {"size": 642, "text": "I next drew up that will to which you so much objected; so that if anything befell me in the person of Dr. Jekyll, I could enter on that of Edward Hyde without pecuniary loss.

Men have before hired bravos to transact their crimes, while their own person and reputation sat under shelter. I was the first that ever did so for his pleasures.

When I would come back from these excursions, I was often plunged into a kind of wonder at my vicarious depravity.

I met with one accident which, as it brought on no consequence, I shall no more than mention.

I smiled to myself, and in my psychological way, began lazily to inquire into the elements of this illusion, occasionally, even as I did so, dropping back into a comfortable morning doze.

It was the hand of Edward Hyde. I must have stared upon it for near half a minute, sunk as I was in the mere stupidity of wonder, before terror woke up in my breast as sudden and startling as the crash of cymbals; and bounding from my bed I rushed to the mirror."}, {"size": 657, "text": "At the sight that met my eyes, my blood was changed into something exquisitely thin and icy. Yes, I had gone to bed Henry Jekyll, I had awakened Edward Hyde. How was this to be explained? I asked myself; and then, with another bound of terror\u2014how was it to be remedied? It was well on in the morning; the servants were up; all my drugs were in the cabinet\u2014a long journey down two pairs of stairs, through the back passage, across the open court and through the anatomical theatre, from where I was then standing horror-struck.

I had soon dressed, as well as I was able, in clothes of my own size: had soon passed through the house, where Bradshaw stared and drew back at seeing Mr. Hyde at such an hour and in such a strange array; and ten minutes later, Dr. Jekyll had returned to his own shape and was sitting down, with a darkened brow, to make a feint of breakfasting. Small indeed was my appetite. This inexplicable incident, this reversal of my previous experience, seemed, like the Babylonian finger on the wall, to be spelling out the letters of my judgment; and I began to reflect more seriously than ever before on the issues and possibilities of my double existence."}, {"size": 818, "text": "That part of me which I had the power of projecting, had lately been much exercised and nourished; it had seemed to me of late as though the body of Edward Hyde had grown in stature, as though (when I wore that form) I were conscious of a more generous tide of blood; and I began to spy a danger that, if this were much prolonged, the balance of my nature might be permanently overthrown, the power of voluntary change be forfeited, and the character of Edward Hyde become irrevocably mine. The power of the drug had not been always equally displayed. Once, very early in my career, it had totally failed me; since then I had been obliged on more than one occasion to double, and once, with infinite risk of death, to treble the amount; and these rare uncertainties had cast hitherto the sole shadow on my contentment."}, {"size": 862, "text": "Now, however, and in the light of that morning\u2019s accident, I was led to remark that whereas, in the beginning, the difficulty had been to throw off the body of Jekyll, it had of late gradually but decidedly transferred itself to the other side. All things therefore seemed to point to this; that I was slowly losing hold of my original and better self, and becoming slowly incorporated with my second and worse. Between these two, I now felt I had to choose. My two natures had memory in common, but all other faculties were most unequally shared between them. Jekyll (who was composite) now with the most sensitive apprehensions, now with a greedy gusto, projected and shared in the pleasures and adventures of Hyde; but Hyde was indifferent to Jekyll, or but remembered him as the mountain bandit remembers the cavern in which he conceals himself from pursuit."}, {"size": 751, "text": "Jekyll had more than a father\u2019s interest; Hyde had more than a son\u2019s indifference.

To cast it in with Hyde, was to die to a thousand interests and aspirations, and to become, at a blow and forever, despised and friendless. The bargain might appear unequal; but there was still another consideration in the scales; for while Jekyll would suffer smartingly in the fires of abstinence, Hyde would be not even conscious of all that he had lost. Strange as my circumstances were, the terms of this debate are as old and commonplace as man; much the same inducements and alarms cast the die for any tempted and trembling sinner;"}, {"size": 611, "text": "and it fell out with me, as it falls with so vast a majority of my fellows, that I chose the better part and was found wanting in the strength to keep to it.

It must have been this, I suppose, that stirred in my soul that tempest of impatience with which I listened to the civilities of my unhappy victim; I declare, at least, before God, no man morally sane could have been guilty of that crime upon so pitiful a provocation; and that I struck in no more reasonable spirit than that in which a sick child may break a plaything."}, {"size": 737, "text": "But I had voluntarily stripped myself of all those balancing instincts by which even the worst of us continues to walk with some degree of steadiness among temptations; and in my case, to be tempted, however slightly, was to fall.

I could have screamed aloud; I sought with tears and prayers to smother down the crowd of hideous images and sounds with which my memory swarmed against me; and still, between the petitions, the ugly face of my iniquity stared into my soul.

The next day, came the news that the murder had not been overlooked, that the guilt of Hyde was patent to the world, and that the victim was a man high in public estimation. It was not only a crime, it had been a tragic folly. I think I was glad to know it; I think I was glad to have my better impulses thus buttressed and guarded by the terrors of the scaffold.

And when at last, thinking the driver had begun to grow suspicious, he discharged the cab and ventured on foot, attired in his misfitting clothes, an object marked out for observation, into the midst of the nocturnal passengers, these two base passions raged within him like a tempest. He walked fast, hunted by his fears, chattering to himself, skulking through the less frequented thoroughfares, counting the minutes that still divided him from midnight. Once a woman spoke to him, offering, I think, a box of lights. He smote her in the face, and she fled."}, {"size": 653, "text": "When I came to myself at Lanyon\u2019s, the horror of my old friend perhaps affected me somewhat: I do not know; it was at least but a drop in the sea to the abhorrence with which I looked back upon these hours. A change had come over me. It was no longer the fear of the gallows, it was the horror of being Hyde that racked me. I received Lanyon\u2019s condemnation partly in a dream; it was partly in a dream that I came home to my own house and got into bed. I slept after the prostration of the day, with a stringent and profound slumber which not even the nightmares that wrung me could avail to break. I awoke in the morning shaken, weakened, but refreshed."}, {"size": 636, "text": "I still hated and feared the thought of the brute that slept within me, and I had not of course forgotten the appalling dangers of the day before; but I was once more at home, in my own house and close to my drugs; and gratitude for my escape shone so strong in my soul that it almost rivalled the brightness of hope. I was stepping leisurely across the court after breakfast, drinking the chill of the air with pleasure, when I was seized again with those indescribable sensations that heralded the change; and I had but the time to gain the shelter of my cabinet, before I was once again raging and freezing with the passions of Hyde."}, {"size": 890, "text": "It took on this occasion a double dose to recall me to myself; and alas! six hours after, as I sat looking sadly in the fire, the pangs returned, and the drug had to be re-administered. In short, from that day forth it seemed only by a great effort as of gymnastics, and only under the immediate stimulation of the drug, that I was able to wear the countenance of Jekyll. At all hours of the day and night, I would be taken with the premonitory shudder; above all, if I slept, or even dozed for a moment in my chair, it was always as Hyde that I awakened. Under the strain of this continually impending doom and by the sleeplessness to which I now condemned myself, ay, even beyond what I had thought possible to man, I became, in my own person, a creature eaten up and emptied by fever, languidly weak both in body and mind, and solely occupied by one thought: the horror of my other self."}, {"size": 874, "text": "But when I slept, or when the virtue of the medicine wore off, I would leap almost without transition (for the pangs of transformation grew daily less marked) into the possession of a fancy brimming with images of terror, a soul boiling with causeless hatreds, and a body that seemed not strong enough to contain the raging energies of life. The powers of Hyde seemed to have grown with the sickliness of Jekyll. And certainly the hate that now divided them was equal on each side. With Jekyll, it was a thing of vital instinct. He had now seen the full deformity of that creature that shared with him some of the phenomena of consciousness, and was co-heir with him to death: and beyond these links of community, which in themselves made the most poignant part of his distress, he thought of Hyde, for all his energy of life, as of something not only hellish but inorganic."}, {"size": 864, "text": "This was the shocking thing; that the slime of the pit seemed to utter cries and voices; that the amorphous dust gesticulated and sinned; that what was dead, and had no shape, should usurp the offices of life. And this again, that that insurgent horror was knit to him closer than a wife, closer than an eye; lay caged in his flesh, where he heard it mutter and felt it struggle to be born; and at every hour of weakness, and in the confidence of slumber, prevailed against him, and deposed him out of life. The hatred of Hyde for Jekyll was of a different order. His terror of the gallows drove him continually to commit temporary suicide, and return to his subordinate station of a part instead of a person; but he loathed the necessity, he loathed the despondency into which Jekyll was now fallen, and he resented the dislike with which he was himself regarded."}, {"size": 754, "text": "Hence the ape-like tricks that he would play me, scrawling in my own hand blasphemies on the pages of my books, burning the letters and destroying the portrait of my father; and indeed, had it not been for his fear of death, he would long ago have ruined himself in order to involve me in the ruin. But his love of life is wonderful; I go further: I, who sicken and freeze at the mere thought of him, when I recall the abjection and passion of this attachment, and when I know how he fears my power to cut him off by suicide, I find it in my heart to pity him. It is useless, and the time awfully fails me, to prolong this description; no one has ever suffered such torments, let that suffice; and yet even to these, habit brought\u2014no, not alleviation\u2014but"}, {"size": 709, "text": "a certain callousness of soul, a certain acquiescence of despair; and my punishment might have gone on for years, but for the last calamity which has now fallen, and which has finally severed me from my own face and nature. My provision of the salt, which had never been renewed since the date of the first experiment, began to run low. I sent out for a fresh supply and mixed the draught; the ebullition followed, and the first change of colour, not the second; I drank it and it was without efficiency. You will learn from Poole how I have had London ransacked; it was in vain; and I am now persuaded that my first supply was impure, and that it was that unknown impurity which lent efficacy to the draught."}, {"size": 731, "text": "About a week has passed, and I am now finishing this statement under the influence of the last of the old powders. This, then, is the last time, short of a miracle, that Henry Jekyll can think his own thoughts or see his own face (now how sadly altered!) in the glass. Nor must I delay too long to bring my writing to an end; for if my narrative has hitherto escaped destruction, it has been by a combination of great prudence and great good luck. Should the throes of change take me in the act of writing it, Hyde will tear it in pieces; but if some time shall have elapsed after I have laid it by, his wonderful selfishness and circumscription to the moment will probably save it once again from the action of his ape-like spite."}, {"size": 728, "text": "And indeed the doom that is closing on us both has already changed and crushed him. Half an hour from now, when I shall again and forever reindue that hated personality, I know how I shall sit shuddering and weeping in my chair, or continue, with the most strained and fearstruck ecstasy of listening, to pace up and down this room (my last earthly refuge) and give ear to every sound of menace. Will Hyde die upon the scaffold? or will he find courage to release himself at the last moment? God knows; I am careless; this is my true hour of death, and what is to follow concerns another than myself. Here then, as I lay down the pen and proceed to seal up my confession, I bring the life of that unhappy Henry Jekyll to an end."}]}
