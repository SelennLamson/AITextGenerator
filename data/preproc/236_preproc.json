And good luck and strong white teeth go with noble children that they may never forget the hungry in this world.\u201d It was the jackal--Tabaqui, the Dish-licker--and the wolves of India despise Tabaqui because he runs about making mischief, and telling tales, and eating rags and pieces of leather from the village rubbish-heaps."}, {"size": 601, "text": "But they are afraid of him too, because Tabaqui, more than anyone else in the jungle, is apt to go mad, and then he forgets that he was ever afraid of anyone, and runs through the forest biting everything in his way.

We call it hydrophobia, but they call it dewanee--the madness--and run. \u201cEnter, then, and look,\u201d said Father Wolf stiffly, \u201cbut there is no food here.\u201d \u201cFor a wolf, no,\u201d said Tabaqui, \u201cbut for so mean a person as myself a dry bone is a good feast."}, {"size": 614, "text": "Who are we, the Gidur-log [the jackal people], to pick and choose?\u201d He scuttled to the back of the cave, where he found the bone of a buck with some meat on it, and sat cracking the end merrily. \u201cAll thanks for this good meal,\u201d he said, licking his lips. \u201cHow beautiful are the noble children! How large are their eyes! And so young too! Indeed, indeed, I might have remembered that the children of kings are men from the beginning.\u201d Now, Tabaqui knew as well as anyone else that there is nothing so unlucky as to compliment children to their faces.

He will frighten every head of game within ten miles, and I--I have to kill for two, these days.\u201d \u201cHis mother did not call him Lungri [the Lame One] for nothing,\u201d said Mother Wolf quietly."}, {"size": 830, "text": "\u201cHe has been lame in one foot from his birth.

Thou hast done harm enough for one night.\u201d \u201cI go,\u201d said Tabaqui quietly. \u201cYe can hear Shere Khan below in the thickets. I might have saved myself the message.\u201d Father Wolf listened, and below in the valley that ran down to a little river he heard the dry, angry, snarly, singsong whine of a tiger who has caught nothing and does not care if all the jungle knows it."}, {"size": 862, "text": "\u201cThe fool!\u201d said Father Wolf. \u201cTo begin a night\u2019s work with that noise!

It is neither bullock nor buck he hunts to-night,\u201d said Mother Wolf. \u201cIt is Man.\u201d The whine had changed to a sort of humming purr that seemed to come from every quarter of the compass. It was the noise that bewilders woodcutters and gypsies sleeping in the open, and makes them run sometimes into the very mouth of the tiger. \u201cMan!\u201d said Father Wolf, showing all his white teeth. \u201cFaugh! Are there not enough beetles and frogs in the tanks that he must eat Man, and on our ground too!\u201d The Law of the Jungle, which never orders anything without a reason, forbids every beast to eat Man except when he is killing to show his children how to kill, and then he must hunt outside the hunting grounds of his pack or tribe."}, {"size": 634, "text": "The real reason for this is that man-killing means, sooner or later, the arrival of white men on elephants, with guns, and hundreds of brown men with gongs and rockets and torches. Then everybody in the jungle suffers. The reason the beasts give among themselves is that Man is the weakest and most defenseless of all living things, and it is unsportsmanlike to touch him. They say too--and it is true--that man-eaters become mangy, and lose their teeth. The purr grew louder, and ended in the full-throated \u201cAaarh!\u201d of the tiger\u2019s charge.

Look!\u201d Directly in front of him, holding on by a low branch, stood a naked brown baby who could just walk--as soft and as dimpled a little atom as ever came to a wolf\u2019s cave at night. He looked up into Father Wolf\u2019s face, and laughed. \u201cIs that a man\u2019s cub?\u201d said Mother Wolf. \u201cI have never seen one. Bring it here.\u201d A Wolf accustomed to moving his own cubs can, if necessary, mouth an egg without breaking it, and though Father Wolf\u2019s jaws closed right on the child\u2019s back not a tooth even scratched the skin as he laid it down among the cubs."}, {"size": 651, "text": "\u201cHow little!

And so this is a man\u2019s cub. Now, was there ever a wolf that could boast of a man\u2019s cub among her children?\u201d \u201cI have heard now and again of such a thing, but never in our Pack or in my time,\u201d said Father Wolf. \u201cHe is altogether without hair, and I could kill him with a touch of my foot. But see, he looks up and is not afraid.\u201d The moonlight was blocked out of the mouth of the cave, for Shere Khan\u2019s great square head and shoulders were thrust into the entrance."}, {"size": 638, "text": "Tabaqui, behind him, was squeaking: \u201cMy lord, my lord, it went in here!\u201d \u201cShere Khan does us great honor,\u201d said Father Wolf, but his eyes were very angry. \u201cWhat does Shere Khan need?\u201d \u201cMy quarry. A man\u2019s cub went this way,\u201d said Shere Khan. \u201cIts parents have run off. Give it to me.\u201d Shere Khan had jumped at a woodcutter\u2019s campfire, as Father Wolf had said, and was furious from the pain of his burned feet. But Father Wolf knew that the mouth of the cave was too narrow for a tiger to come in by. Even where he was, Shere Khan\u2019s shoulders and forepaws were cramped for want of room, as a man\u2019s would be if he tried to fight in a barrel."}, {"size": 608, "text": "\u201cThe Wolves are a free people,\u201d said Father Wolf. \u201cThey take orders from the Head of the Pack, and not from any striped cattle-killer.

By the bull that I killed, am I to stand nosing into your dog\u2019s den for my fair dues? It is I, Shere Khan, who speak!\u201d The tiger\u2019s roar filled the cave with thunder. Mother Wolf shook herself clear of the cubs and sprang forward, her eyes, like two green moons in the darkness, facing the blazing eyes of Shere Khan. \u201cAnd it is I, Raksha [The Demon], who answers."}, {"size": 612, "text": "The man\u2019s cub is mine, Lungri--mine to me! He shall not be killed. He shall live to run with the Pack and to hunt with the Pack; and in the end, look you, hunter of little naked cubs--frog-eater--fish-killer--he shall hunt thee! Now get hence, or by the Sambhur that I killed (I eat no starved cattle), back thou goest to thy mother, burned beast of the jungle, lamer than ever thou camest into the world! Go!\u201d Father Wolf looked on amazed. He had almost forgotten the days when he won Mother Wolf in fair fight from five other wolves, when she ran in the Pack and was not called The Demon for compliment\u2019s sake."}, {"size": 611, "text": "Shere Khan might have faced Father Wolf, but he could not stand up against Mother Wolf, for he knew that where he was she had all the advantage of the ground, and would fight to the death. So he backed out of the cave mouth growling, and when he was clear he shouted: \u201cEach dog barks in his own yard! We will see what the Pack will say to this fostering of man-cubs. The cub is mine, and to my teeth he will come in the end, O bush-tailed thieves!\u201d Mother Wolf threw herself down panting among the cubs, and Father Wolf said to her gravely: \u201cShere Khan speaks this much truth. The cub must be shown to the Pack."}, {"size": 692, "text": "Wilt thou still keep him, Mother?\u201d \u201cKeep him!\u201d she gasped. \u201cHe came naked, by night, alone and very hungry; yet he was not afraid! Look, he has pushed one of my babes to one side already. And that lame butcher would have killed him and would have run off to the Waingunga while the villagers here hunted through all our lairs in revenge! Keep him? Assuredly I will keep him. Lie still, little frog. O thou Mowgli--for Mowgli the Frog I will call thee--the time will come when thou wilt hunt Shere Khan as he has hunted thee.\u201d \u201cBut what will our Pack say?\u201d said Father Wolf. The Law of the Jungle lays down very clearly that any wolf may, when he marries, withdraw from the Pack he belongs to."}, {"size": 734, "text": "But as soon as his cubs are old enough to stand on their feet he must bring them to the Pack Council, which is generally held once a month at full moon, in order that the other wolves may identify them. After that inspection the cubs are free to run where they please, and until they have killed their first buck no excuse is accepted if a grown wolf of the Pack kills one of them. The punishment is death where the murderer can be found; and if you think for a minute you will see that this must be so. Father Wolf waited till his cubs could run a little, and then on the night of the Pack Meeting took them and Mowgli and Mother Wolf to the Council Rock--a hilltop covered with stones and boulders where a hundred wolves could hide."}, {"size": 745, "text": "Akela, the great gray Lone Wolf, who led all the Pack by strength and cunning, lay out at full length on his rock, and below him sat forty or more wolves of every size and color, from badger-colored veterans who could handle a buck alone to young black three-year-olds who thought they could. The Lone Wolf had led them for a year now. He had fallen twice into a wolf trap in his youth, and once he had been beaten and left for dead; so he knew the manners and customs of men. There was very little talking at the Rock. The cubs tumbled over each other in the center of the circle where their mothers and fathers sat, and now and again a senior wolf would go quietly up to a cub, look at him carefully, and return to his place on noiseless feet."}, {"size": 688, "text": "Sometimes a mother would push her cub far out into the moonlight to be sure that he had not been overlooked. Akela from his rock would cry: \u201cYe know the Law--ye know the Law. Look well, O Wolves!\u201d And the anxious mothers would take up the call: \u201cLook--look well, O Wolves!\u201d At last--and Mother Wolf\u2019s neck bristles lifted as the time came--Father Wolf pushed \u201cMowgli the Frog,\u201d as they called him, into the center, where he sat laughing and playing with some pebbles that glistened in the moonlight. Akela never raised his head from his paws, but went on with the monotonous cry: \u201cLook well!\u201d A muffled roar came up from behind the rocks--the voice of Shere Khan crying: \u201cThe cub is mine."}, {"size": 608, "text": "Give him to me. What have the Free People to do with a man\u2019s cub?\u201d Akela never even twitched his ears. All he said was: \u201cLook well, O Wolves! What have the Free People to do with the orders of any save the Free People? Look well!\u201d There was a chorus of deep growls, and a young wolf in his fourth year flung back Shere Khan\u2019s question to Akela: \u201cWhat have the Free People to do with a man\u2019s cub?\u201d Now, the Law of the Jungle lays down that if there is any dispute as to the right of a cub to be accepted by the Pack, he must be spoken for by at least two members of the Pack who are not his father and mother."}, {"size": 620, "text": "\u201cWho speaks for this cub?\u201d said Akela. \u201cAmong the Free People who speaks?\u201d There was no answer and Mother Wolf got ready for what she knew would be her last fight, if things came to fighting. Then the only other creature who is allowed at the Pack Council--Baloo, the sleepy brown bear who teaches the wolf cubs the Law of the Jungle: old Baloo, who can come and go where he pleases because he eats only nuts and roots and honey--rose upon his hind quarters and grunted. \u201cThe man\u2019s cub--the man\u2019s cub?\u201d he said. \u201cI speak for the man\u2019s cub. There is no harm in a man\u2019s cub. I have no gift of words, but I speak the truth."}, {"size": 658, "text": "Let him run with the Pack, and be entered with the others. I myself will teach him.\u201d \u201cWe need yet another,\u201d said Akela. \u201cBaloo has spoken, and he is our teacher for the young cubs. Who speaks besides Baloo?\u201d A black shadow dropped down into the circle. It was Bagheera the Black Panther, inky black all over, but with the panther markings showing up in certain lights like the pattern of watered silk. Everybody knew Bagheera, and nobody cared to cross his path; for he was as cunning as Tabaqui, as bold as the wild buffalo, and as reckless as the wounded elephant. But he had a voice as soft as wild honey dripping from a tree, and a skin softer than down."}, {"size": 632, "text": "\u201cO Akela, and ye the Free People,\u201d he purred, \u201cI have no right in your assembly, but the Law of the Jungle says that if there is a doubt which is not a killing matter in regard to a new cub, the life of that cub may be bought at a price. And the Law does not say who may or may not pay that price. Am I right?\u201d \u201cGood! Good!\u201d said the young wolves, who are always hungry. \u201cListen to Bagheera. The cub can be bought for a price. It is the Law.\u201d \u201cKnowing that I have no right to speak here, I ask your leave.\u201d \u201cSpeak then,\u201d cried twenty voices. \u201cTo kill a naked cub is shame. Besides, he may make better sport for you when he is grown."}, {"size": 632, "text": "Baloo has spoken in his behalf. Now to Baloo\u2019s word I will add one bull, and a fat one, newly killed, not half a mile from here, if ye will accept the man\u2019s cub according to the Law. Is it difficult?\u201d There was a clamor of scores of voices, saying: \u201cWhat matter? He will die in the winter rains. He will scorch in the sun. What harm can a naked frog do us? Let him run with the Pack. Where is the bull, Bagheera? Let him be accepted.\u201d And then came Akela\u2019s deep bay, crying: \u201cLook well--look well, O Wolves!\u201d Mowgli was still deeply interested in the pebbles, and he did not notice when the wolves came and looked at him one by one."}, {"size": 822, "text": "At last they all went down the hill for the dead bull, and only Akela, Bagheera, Baloo, and Mowgli\u2019s own wolves were left. Shere Khan roared still in the night, for he was very angry that Mowgli had not been handed over to him. \u201cAy, roar well,\u201d said Bagheera, under his whiskers, \u201cfor the time will come when this naked thing will make thee roar to another tune, or I know nothing of man.\u201d \u201cIt was well done,\u201d said Akela. \u201cMen and their cubs are very wise. He may be a help in time.\u201d \u201cTruly, a help in time of need; for none can hope to lead the Pack forever,\u201d said Bagheera. Akela said nothing. He was thinking of the time that comes to every leader of every pack when his strength goes from him and he gets feebler and feebler, till at last he is killed by the wolves and a new leader comes up--to be killed in his turn."}, {"size": 889, "text": "\u201cTake him away,\u201d he said to Father Wolf, \u201cand train him as befits one of the Free People.\u201d And that is how Mowgli was entered into the Seeonee Wolf Pack for the price of a bull and on Baloo\u2019s good word. Now you must be content to skip ten or eleven whole years, and only guess at all the wonderful life that Mowgli led among the wolves, because if it were written out it would fill ever so many books. He grew up with the cubs, though they, of course, were grown wolves almost before he was a child. And Father Wolf taught him his business, and the meaning of things in the jungle, till every rustle in the grass, every breath of the warm night air, every note of the owls above his head, every scratch of a bat\u2019s claws as it roosted for a while in a tree, and every splash of every little fish jumping in a pool meant just as much to him as the work of his office means to a business man."}, {"size": 724, "text": "When he was not learning he sat out in the sun and slept, and ate and went to sleep again. When he felt dirty or hot he swam in the forest pools; and when he wanted honey (Baloo told him that honey and nuts were just as pleasant to eat as raw meat) he climbed up for it, and that Bagheera showed him how to do. Bagheera would lie out on a branch and call, \u201cCome along, Little Brother,\u201d and at first Mowgli would cling like the sloth, but afterward he would fling himself through the branches almost as boldly as the gray ape. He took his place at the Council Rock, too, when the Pack met, and there he discovered that if he stared hard at any wolf, the wolf would be forced to drop his eyes, and so he used to stare for fun."}, {"size": 626, "text": "At other times he would pick the long thorns out of the pads of his friends, for wolves suffer terribly from thorns and burs in their coats. He would go down the hillside into the cultivated lands by night, and look very curiously at the villagers in their huts, but he had a mistrust of men because Bagheera showed him a square box with a drop gate so cunningly hidden in the jungle that he nearly walked into it, and told him that it was a trap. He loved better than anything else to go with Bagheera into the dark warm heart of the forest, to sleep all through the drowsy day, and at night see how Bagheera did his killing."}, {"size": 694, "text": "Bagheera killed right and left as he felt hungry, and so did Mowgli--with one exception. As soon as he was old enough to understand things, Bagheera told him that he must never touch cattle because he had been bought into the Pack at the price of a bull\u2019s life. \u201cAll the jungle is thine,\u201d said Bagheera, \u201cand thou canst kill everything that thou art strong enough to kill; but for the sake of the bull that bought thee thou must never kill or eat any cattle young or old. That is the Law of the Jungle.\u201d Mowgli obeyed faithfully. And he grew and grew strong as a boy must grow who does not know that he is learning any lessons, and who has nothing in the world to think of except things to eat."}, {"size": 634, "text": "Mother Wolf told him once or twice that Shere Khan was not a creature to be trusted, and that some day he must kill Shere Khan. But though a young wolf would have remembered that advice every hour, Mowgli forgot it because he was only a boy--though he would have called himself a wolf if he had been able to speak in any human tongue. Shere Khan was always crossing his path in the jungle, for as Akela grew older and feebler the lame tiger had come to be great friends with the younger wolves of the Pack, who followed him for scraps, a thing Akela would never have allowed if he had dared to push his authority to the proper bounds."}, {"size": 691, "text": "Then Shere Khan would flatter them and wonder that such fine young hunters were content to be led by a dying wolf and a man\u2019s cub. \u201cThey tell me,\u201d Shere Khan would say, \u201cthat at Council ye dare not look him between the eyes.\u201d And the young wolves would growl and bristle. Bagheera, who had eyes and ears everywhere, knew something of this, and once or twice he told Mowgli in so many words that Shere Khan would kill him some day. Mowgli would laugh and answer: \u201cI have the Pack and I have thee; and Baloo, though he is so lazy, might strike a blow or two for my sake.

I am sleepy, Bagheera, and Shere Khan is all long tail and loud talk--like Mao, the Peacock.\u201d \u201cBut this is no time for sleeping.

They come in the summer months by hundreds and hundreds of thousands out of the cold gray sea. For Novastoshnah Beach has the finest accommodation for seals of any place in all the world.

When he heaved himself up on his front flippers he stood more than four feet clear of the ground, and his weight, if anyone had been bold enough to weigh him, was nearly seven hundred pounds. He was scarred all over with the marks of savage fights, but he was always ready for just one fight more. He would put his head on one side, as though he were afraid to look his enemy in the face; then he would shoot it out like lightning, and when the big teeth were firmly fixed on the other seal\u2019s neck, the other seal might get away if he could, but Sea Catch would not help him."}, {"size": 730, "text": "Yet Sea Catch never chased a beaten seal, for that was against the Rules of the Beach. He only wanted room by the sea for his nursery. But as there were forty or fifty thousand other seals hunting for the same thing each spring, the whistling, bellowing, roaring, and blowing on the beach was something frightful. From a little hill called Hutchinson\u2019s Hill, you could look over three and a half miles of ground covered with fighting seals; and the surf was dotted all over with the heads of seals hurrying to land and begin their share of the fighting. They fought in the breakers, they fought in the sand, and they fought on the smooth-worn basalt rocks of the nurseries, for they were just as stupid and unaccommodating as men."}, {"size": 756, "text": "Their wives never came to the island until late in May or early in June, for they did not care to be torn to pieces; and the young two-, three-, and four-year-old seals who had not begun housekeeping went inland about half a mile through the ranks of the fighters and played about on the sand dunes in droves and legions, and rubbed off every single green thing that grew. They were called the holluschickie--the bachelors--and there were perhaps two or three hundred thousand of them at Novastoshnah alone. Sea Catch had just finished his forty-fifth fight one spring when Matkah, his soft, sleek, gentle-eyed wife, came up out of the sea, and he caught her by the scruff of the neck and dumped her down on his reservation, saying gruffly: \u201cLate as usual."}, {"size": 715, "text": "Where have you been?\u201d It was not the fashion for Sea Catch to eat anything during the four months he stayed on the beaches, and so his temper was generally bad.

Matkah used to go to sea to get things to eat, and the baby was fed only once in two days, but then he ate all he could and throve upon it. The first thing he did was to crawl inland, and there he met tens of thousands of babies of his own age, and they played together like puppies, went to sleep on the clean sand, and played again.

There were always a few hundred mothers hunting for their children through the playgrounds, and the babies were kept lively.

He was two weeks learning to use his flippers; and all that while he floundered in and out of the water, and coughed and grunted and crawled up the beach and took catnaps on the sand, and went back again, until at last he found that he truly belonged to the water."}, {"size": 702, "text": "Then you can imagine the times that he had with his companions, ducking under the rollers; or coming in on top of a comber and landing with a swash and a splutter as the big wave went whirling far up the beach; or standing up on his tail and scratching his head as the old people did; or playing \u201cI\u2019m the King of the Castle\u201d on slippery, weedy rocks that just stuck out of the wash. Now and then he would see a thin fin, like a big shark\u2019s fin, drifting along close to shore, and he knew that that was the Killer Whale, the Grampus, who eats young seals when he can get them; and Kotick would head for the beach like an arrow, and the fin would jig off slowly, as if it were looking for nothing at all."}, {"size": 753, "text": "Late in October the seals began to leave St. Paul\u2019s for the deep sea, by families and tribes, and there was no more fighting over the nurseries, and the holluschickie played anywhere they liked. \u201cNext year,\u201d said Matkah to Kotick, \u201cyou will be a holluschickie; but this year you must learn how to catch fish.\u201d They set out together across the Pacific, and Matkah showed Kotick how to sleep on his back with his flippers tucked down by his side and his little nose just out of the water. No cradle is so comfortable as the long, rocking swell of the Pacific.

That night Kotick danced the Fire-dance with the yearling seals.

He has only six bones in his neck where he ought to have seven, and they say under the sea that that prevents him from speaking even to his companions.

Even a little boy could be of use there, and Toomai was as useful as three boys. He would get his torch and wave it, and yell with the best.
