It's enough to make a man die of senility to have ten years tacked to his age.\" \"And if,\" he went on, \"if anything happens to me, Minnie, I'm counting on you to do what you can for the old place. You've been here a good many years, Minnie.\" \"Fourteen years I have been ladling out water at this spring,\" I said, trying to keep my lips from trembling. \"I wouldn't be at home any place else, unless it would be in an aquarium. But don't ask me to stay here and help Mr. Dick sell the old place for a summer hotel. For that's what he'll do.\" \"He won't sell it,\" declared the old doctor grimly. \"All I want is for you to promise to stay.\" \"Oh, I'll stay,\" I said. \"I won't promise to be agreeable, but I'll stay. Somebody'll have to look after the spring; I reckon Mr. Dick thinks it comes out of the earth just as we sell it, with the whole pharmacopoeia in it.\" Well, it made the old doctor happier, and I'm not sorry I promised, but I've got a joint on my right foot that throbs when it is going to rain or I am going to have bad luck, and it gave a jump then. I might have known there was trouble ahead.",

What with the old doctor talking about dying, and Miss Patty Jennings gone to Mexico, when I'd been looking forward to her and her cantankerous old father coming to Hope Springs for February, as they mostly did, I was depressed all day. I got to the point where Mr. Moody feeding nickels into the slot-machine with one hand and eating zwieback with the other made me nervous. After a while he went to sleep over it, and when he had slipped a nickel in his mouth and tried to put the zwieback in the machine he muttered something and went up to the house. I was glad to be alone. I drew a chair in front of the fire and wondered what I would do if the old doctor died, and what a fool I'd been not to be a school-teacher, which is what I studied for. I was thinking to myself bitterly that all that my experience in the spring fitted me for was to be a mermaid, when I heard something running down the path, and it turned out to be Tillie, the diet cook. She slammed the door behind her and threw the Finleyville evening paper at me. \"There!\" she said, \"I've won a cake of toilet soap from Bath-house Mike. The emperor's consented.\" \"Nonsense!\" I snapped, and snatched the paper. Tillie was right; the emperor HAD! I sat down and read it through, and there was Miss Patty's picture in an oval and the prince's in another, with a turned-up mustache and his hand on the handle of his sword, and between them both was the Austrian emperor.",

If he was even standing beside a chair I could get a line on him. He may be only four feet high.\" \"Then Miss Jennings wouldn't love him,\" declared Tillie. \"How do you reckon he makes his mustache point up like that?\" \"What's love got to do with it?\" I demanded. \"Don't be a fool, Tillie. It takes more than two people's pictures in a newspaper with a red heart around them and an overweight cupid above to make a love-match. Love's a word that's used to cover a good many sins and to excuse them all.\" \"She isn't that kind,\" said Tillie. \"She's--she's as sweet as she's beautiful, and you're as excited as I am, Minnie Waters, and if you're not, what have you got the drinking glass she used last winter put on the top shelf out of reach for?\" She went to the door and slammed it open. \"Thank heaven I'm not a dried-up old maid,\" she called back over her shoulder, \"and when you're through hugging that paper you can send it up to the house.\" Well, I sat there and thought it over, Miss Patty, or Miss Patricia, being, so to speak, a friend of mine.",

Many a time she'd slipped away from her governess and come down to the spring-house for a chat with me, and we'd make pop-corn together by my open fire, and talk about love and clothes, and even the tariff, Miss Patty being for protection, which was natural, seeing that was the way her father made his money, and I for free trade, especially in the winter when my tips fall off considerable. And when she was younger she would sit back from the fire, with the corn-popper on her lap and her cheeks as red as cranberries, and say: \"I DON'T know why I tell you all these things, Minnie, but Aunt Honoria's funny, and I can't talk to Dorothy; she's too young, you know. Well, HE said--\" only every winter it was a different \"he.\" In my wash-stand drawer I'd kept all the clippings about her coming out and the winter she spent in Washington and was supposed to be engaged to the president's son, and the magazine article that told how Mr. Jennings had got his money by robbing widows and orphans, and showed the little frame house where Miss Patty was born--as if she's had anything to do with it. And so now I was cutting out the picture of her and the prince and the article underneath which told how many castles she'd have, and I don't mind saying I was sniffling a little bit, for I couldn't get used to the idea. And suddenly the door closed softly and there was a rustle behind me.",

I could hardly believe it. \"Why won't you talk about it?\" she insisted, catching me by the shoulders and holding me off. \"Minnie, your eyes are as red as your hair!\" \"I don't approve of it,\" I said. \"You might as well know it now as later, Miss Patty. I don't believe in mixed marriages. I had a cousin that married a Jew, and what with him making the children promise to be good on the Talmud and her trying to raise them with the Bible, the poor things is that mixed up that it's pitiful.\" She got a little red at that, but she sat down and took up the clipping. \"He's much better looking than that, Minnie,\" she said soberly, \"and he's a good Catholic. But if that's the way you feel we'll not talk about it. I've had enough trouble at home as it is.\" \"I guess from that your father isn't crazy about it,\" I remarked, getting her a glass of spring water. The papers had been full of how Mr. Jennings had forbidden the prince the house when he had been in America the summer before. \"Certainly he's crazy about it--almost insane!\" she said, and smiled at me in her old way over the top of the glass.",

And now we're going to stop talking about him--you're worse than the newspapers.\" She took off her things and going into my closet began to rummage for the pop-corn. \"Oh, how glad I am to get away,\" she sang out to me. \"We're supposed to have gone to Mexico; even Dorothy doesn't know. Where's the pop-corner or the corn-popper or whatever you call it?\" She was as happy to have escaped the reporters and the people she knew as a child, and she sat down on the floor in front of the fire and began to shell the corn into the popper, as if she'd done it only the day before. \"I guess you're safe enough here,\" I said. \"It's always slack in January--only a few chronics and the Saturday-to-Monday husbands, except a drummer now and then who drives up from Finleyville.

One minute he was givin' me the divil for something or other, and the next--I thought he was asleep.\" Something that had been heavy in my breast all afternoon suddenly seemed to burst and made me feel faint all over. But I didn't lose my head. \"Does anybody know yet?\" I asked quickly. He shook his head. \"Then he didn't die in the bath-house, Mike,\" I said firmly. \"He died in his bed, and you know it. If it gets out that he died in the hot room I'll have the coroner on you.\" Miss Patty was standing by the railing of the spring. I got my shawl and started out after Mike, and she followed. \"If the guests ever get hold of this they'll stampede. Start any excitement in a sanatorium,\" I said, \"and one and all they'll dip their thermometers in hot water and swear they've got fever!\" And we hurried to the house together.",

The Van Alstynes came back at once, in very bad tempers, and we had the funeral from the preacher's house in Finleyville so as not to harrow up the sanatorium people any more than necessary. Even as it was a few left, but about twenty of the chronics stayed, and it looked as if we might be able to keep going. Miss Patty sent to town for a black veil for me, and even went to the funeral. It helped to take my mind off my troubles to think who it was that was holding my hand and comforting me, and when, toward the end of the service, she got out her handkerchief and wiped her eyes I was almost overcome, she being, so to speak, in the very shadow of a throne. After it was all over the relatives gathered in the sun parlor of the sanatorium to hear the will--Mr. Van Alstyne and his wife and about twenty more who had come up from the city for the funeral and stayed over--on the house. Well, the old doctor left me the buttons for his full dress waistcoat and his favorite copy of Gray's Anatomy. I couldn't exactly set up housekeeping with my share of the estate, but when the lawyer read that part of the will aloud and a grin went around the room I flounced out of my chair.",

Well, that set of buttons was the set he bought in London on his wedding trip, and the book's the one he read himself to sleep with every night for twenty years. I'm proud to get them.\" Mr. Van Alstyne touched me on the arm. \"Everybody knows how loyal you've been, Minnie,\" he assured me. \"Now sit down like a good girl and listen to the rest of the will.\" \"While I'm up I might as well get something else off my mind,\" I said. \"I know what's in that will, but I hadn't anything to do with it, Mr. Van Alstyne. He took advantage of my being laid up with influenza last spring.\" They thought that was funny, but a few minutes later they weren't so cheerful. You see the sanatorium was a mighty fine piece of property, with a deer park and golf links. We'd had plenty of offers to sell it for a summer hotel, but we'd both been dead against it. That was one of the reasons for the will. The whole estate was left to Dicky Carter, who hadn't been able to come, owing to his being laid up with an attack of mumps. The family sat up and nodded at one another, or held up its hands, but when they heard there was a condition they breathed easier.",

If at the end of that time the place was being successfully conducted and could show that it hadn't lost money, the entire property became his for keeps. If he failed it was to be sold and the money given to charity. You would have to know Richard Carter to understand the excitement the will caused. Most of us, I reckon, like the sort of person we've never dared to be ourselves. The old doctor had gone to bed at ten o'clock all his life and got up at seven, and so he had a sneaking fondness for the one particular grandson who often didn't go to bed at all. Twice to my knowledge when he was in his teens did Dicky Carter run away from school, and twice his grandfather kept him for a week hidden in the shelter-house on the golf links. Naturally when Mr. Van Alstyne and I had to hide him again, which is further on in the story, he went to the old shelter-house like a dog to its kennel, only this time--but that's ahead, too. Well, the family went back to town in a buzz of indignation, and I carried my waistcoat buttons and my Anatomy out to the spring-house and had a good cry.

As I've said, they'd been on their honeymoon, and they were both sulky at having to stay at the Springs. It was particularly hard on Mrs. Van Alstyne, because, with seven trunks of trousseau with her, she had to put on black. But she used to shut herself up in her room in the evenings and deck out for Mr. Sam in her best things. We found it out one evening when Mrs. Biggs set fire to her bureau cover with her alcohol curling-iron heater, and Mrs. Sam, who had been going around in a black crepe dress all day, rushed out in pink satin with crystal trimming, and slippers with cut-glass heels. After the first rubber Mrs. Van Alstyne threw her cards on the floor and said another day like this would finish her. \"Surely Dick is able to come now,\" she said, like a peevish child. \"Didn't he say the swelling was all gone?\" \"Do you expect me to pick up those cards?\" Mr. Sam asked angrily, looking at her. Mrs. Sam yawned and looked up at him. \"Of course I do,\" she answered. \"If it wasn't for you I'd not have stayed a moment after the funeral.

Mr. Sam came in and slammed the door behind him. \"What's this about Mr. Dick not being here?\" he shouted. \"Well, he isn't. That's all there is to it, Mr. Van Alstyne,\" I said calmly. I am always calm when other people get excited. For that reason some people think my red hair is a false alarm, but they soon find out. \"But he MUST be here,\" said Mr. Van Alstyne. \"I put him on the train myself yesterday, and waited until it started to be sure he was off.\"",

I sat down on the other side of the fireplace, and it seemed to me that father's crayon enlargement over the mantel shook its head at me.

Mr. Sam was keeping the lawyer, Mr. Stitt, in the billiard room, and by four o'clock they'd had everything that was in the bar and were inventing new combinations of their own. And Mrs. Sam had gone to bed with a nervous headache. Senator Biggs brought the mail down to the spring-house at four, but there was nothing for me except a note from Mr. Sam, rather shaky, which said he'd no word yet and that Mr. Stitt had mixed all the cordials in the bar in a beer glass and had had to go to bed. At half past four Mr. Thoburn came out for a minute. He said there was only one other train from town that night and the chances were it would be snowed up at the junction. \"Better get on the band wagon before the parade's gone past,\" he said in an undertone. But I went into my pantry and shut the door with a slam, and when I came out he was gone. I nearly went crazy that afternoon. I put salt in Miss Cobb's glass when she always drank the water plain. Once I put the broom in the fire and started to sweep the porch with a fire log Luckily they were busy with their letters and it went unnoticed, the smell of burning straw not rising, so to speak, above the sulphur in the spring.",

It always ends the same way: the man with the loudest voice wins, and the defeated ones limp over to the spring and tell their theories to me. They know I'm being paid to listen. On this particular afternoon the bishop stopped the riot by rising and holding up his hand. \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he said, \"let us not be rancorous.

It was when I had influenza that the old doctor made the will, you remember. Maybe I was crying, I don't recall. It was dark outside, and nothing inside but firelight. Suddenly I seemed to feel somebody looking at the back of my neck and I turned around. There was a man standing outside one of the windows, staring in. My first thought, of course, was that it was Mr. Dick, but just as the face vanished I saw that it wasn't. It was older by three or four years than Mr. Dick's and a bit fuller. I'm not nervous. I've had to hold my own against chronic grouches too long to have nerves, so I went to the door and looked out. The man came around the corner just then and I could see him plainly in the firelight. He was covered with snow, and he wore a sweater and no overcoat, but he looked like a gentleman. \"I beg your pardon for spying,\" he said, \"but the fire looked so snug!

And then and there he sat down and told Mr. Pierce the trouble we were in, and what sort of cheerful idiot Dicky Carter was, and how everybody liked him, but wished he would grow up before the family good name was gone, and that now he had a chance to make good and be self-supporting, and he wasn't around, and if Mr. Sam ever got his hands on him he'd choke a little sense down his throat. And then Mr. Pierce told about the play and the mumps, and how he was stranded. When Mr. Sam asked him outright if he'd take Mr. Dick's place overnight he agreed at once. \"I haven't anything to lose,\" he said, \"and anyhow I've been on a diet of Sweet Peas so long that a sanatorium is about what I need.\" \"It's like this,\" explained Mr. Sam, \"Old Stitt is pretty thoroughly jingled--excuse me, Minnie, but it's the fact. I'll take you to his room, with the lights low, and all you'll need to do is to shake hands with him. He's going on the early train to-morrow.

She's not so good we can't replace her, and what's the use of swallowing a camel and then sticking at a housekeeper?\" \"You can't get her out of the house in an hour,\" he objected, but in a weak voice. \"I can!\" I said firmly. (I did. Inside of an hour she went to the clerk, Mr. Slocum, and handed in her resignation. She was a touchy person, but I did NOT say all that was quoted. I did NOT say the kitchen was filthy; I only said it took away my appetite to look in at the door. But she left, which is the point.) Well, I stood in the doorway and watched them disappear in the darkness, and I felt better than I had all day.",

The news stand includes tobacco and a circulating library, and is close to the office, and if I missed any human nature at the spring I got it there. If you can't tell all about a man by the way he asks for mineral water and drinks it, by the time you've supplied his literature and his tobacco and heard him grumbling over his bill at the office, you've got a line on him and a hook in it. After I ate my supper I relieved Amanda King, who runs the news stand in the daytime, when she isn't laid off with the toothache. Mr. Sam was right. All the women had on their puffs, and they were sitting in a half-circle on each side of the door. Mrs. Sam was there, looking frightened and anxious, and standing near the card-room door was Miss Patty. She was all in white, with two red spots on her cheeks, and I thought if her prince could have seen her then he would pretty nearly have eaten her up. Mr. Thoburn was there, of course, pretending to read the paper, but every now and then he looked at his watch, and once he got up and paced off the lobby, putting down the length in his note-book. I didn't need a mind-reader to tell me he was figuring the cost of a new hardwood floor and four new rugs. Mr. Sam came to the news stand, and he was so nervous he could hardly light a cigarette.",

I found some chicken and got a bottle of the old doctor's wine--I had kept the key of his wine-cellar since he died--and carried the tray up to Mr. Pierce's sitting-room. He had the old doctor's suite. The door was open an inch or so, and as I was about to knock I heard a girl's voice. It was Miss Patty! \"How can you deny it?\" she was saying angrily. \"I dare say you will even deny that you ever saw this letter before!\" There was a minute's pause while I suppose he looked at the letter. \"I never did!\" he said solemnly. There had been a queer sound all along, but now I made it out. Some one else was in the room, sniveling and crying. \"My poor lamb!\" it whimpered.

I waded around to the door and walked in, and there was a grand upsetting of the sealskin coat and my shepherd's plaid shawl. Mr. Dick jumped to his feet and Mrs. Dick sat bolt upright and stared at me over the backs of the chairs. \"Minnie!\" cried Mr. Dick. \"As I'm a married man, it's Minnie herself; Minnie, the guardian angel! The spirit of the place! Dorothy, don't you remember Minnie?\" She came toward me with her hand out. She was a pretty little thing, not so beautiful as Miss Patty, but with a nice way about her. \"I'm awfully glad to see you again,\" she said. \"Of course I remember--why you are hardly dressed at all! You must be frozen!\" I went over to the fire and emptied my bedroom slippers of snow.",

They wanted to have her wakened at once, but I refused, although I agreed to bring her out first thing in the morning. \"But you can't stay here,\" I said. \"There'll be Miss Cobb at nine o'clock, and the man comes to light the fire at eight.\" \"We could go to the old shelter-house on the golf links,\" suggested Mr. Dick, looking me square in the eye.

Twice I went into a drift to my waist, and once a rabbit bunted into me head on, and would have scared me into a chill if I hadn't been shaking already. The two behind me were cheerful enough. Mr. Dick pointed out the general direction of the deer park which hides the shelter-house from the sanatorium, and if you'll believe it, with snow so thick I had to scrape it off the lantern every minute or so, those children planned to give something called A Midsummer Night's Dream in the deer park among the trees in the spring, to entertain the patients.",

I tell you I felt a hundred years old. We got into the shelter-house by my crawling through a window, and when we had lighted the fire and hung up the lantern, it didn't seem so bad. The place had been closed since summer, and it seemed colder than outside, but those two did the barn dance then and there. There were two rooms, and Mr. Dick had always used the back one to hide in. It's a good thing Mrs. Dick was not a suspicious person. Many a woman would have wondered when she saw him lift a board in the floor and take out a rusty tin basin, a cake of soap, a moldy towel, a can of sardines, a tooth-brush and a rubber carriage robe to lay over the rafters under the hole in the roof. But it's been my experience that the first few days of married life women are blind because they want to be and after that because they have to be. It was about four when I left them, sitting on a soap box in front of the fire toasting sardines on the end of Mr. Dick's walking-stick. Mrs. Dick made me put on her sealskin coat, and I took the lantern, leaving them in the firelight.

I put on two pairs of stockings and heavy shoes, for I knew I was going to do the Eskimo act again that day and goodness knows how many days more, and then I went down and knocked at the door of Miss Patty's room.

She called to me in an undertone to come in, and she was lying propped up with pillows, with something pink around her shoulders and the night lamp burning beside the bed. She had a book in her hand, but all over the covers and on the table at her elbow were letters in the blue foreign envelopes with the red and black and gold seal. I walked over to the foot of the bed. \"They're here,\" I said. She sat up, and some letters slid to the floor. \"THEY'RE here!\" she repeated. \"Do you mean Dorothy?\" \"She and her husband.

He's going to annul the marriage, or he'll make a scandal anyhow, and that's just as bad. Dolly,\"--she turned to her sister imploringly--\"Dolly, I can't have a scandal now.

It's just as Aunt Honoria said; the family will make a tremendous row beforehand, but afterward, when it all turns out well, they'll take the credit.\" Mr. Dick was busy with the beans and I was turning the eggs.

I'm an advocate of marrying for love every time, although a title and a bunch of family jewels thrown in wouldn't worry me. \"Do you want me to protest that the man who has asked me to marry him cares about me?\" Miss Patty replied in an angry undertone. \"Couldn't he have married a thousand other girls!

He had spent the morning tramping over the hills with a gun and keeping out of the way of people, and what with three square meals, a good night's sleep and the exercise, he was looking a lot better. Seen in daylight, he had very dark hair and blue-gray eyes and a very square chin, although it had a sort of dimple in it. I used to wonder which won out, the dimple or the chin, but I wasn't long in finding out. Well, he looked dazed when I took him to the shelter-house and he saw Mr. Dick and Mrs. Dick and the Mr. Sams and Miss Patty. They gave him a lawn-mower to sit on, and Mr. Sam explained the situation. \"I know it's asking a good bit, Mr. Pierce,\" he said, \"and personally I can see only one way out of all this. Carter ought to go in and take charge, and his--er--wife ought to go back to school. But they won't have it, and--er--there are other reasons.\" He glanced at Miss Patty. Mr. Pierce also glanced at Miss Patty. He'd been glancing at her at intervals of two seconds ever since she came in, and being a woman and having a point to gain, Miss Patty seemed to have forgotten the night before, and was very nice to him. Once she smiled directly at him, and whatever he was saying died in his throat of the shock. When she turned her head away he stared at the back of her neck, and when she looked at the fire he gazed at her profile, and always with that puzzled look, as if he hadn't yet come to believe that she was the newspaper Miss Jennings.",

And set up housekeeping in the shelter-house with my good friend Minnie carrying us food and wearing herself to a shadow, not to mention bringing trashy books to my bride.\" \"She isn't that kind,\" I broke in, and got red. I'd been thinking of Miss Patty. But he went over to the table and picked up his glass of spring water, only to set it down untasted. \"No, she's not that kind!\" he agreed, and never noticed the slip. \"You know, Minnie, women aren't all alike, but they're not all different. An English writer has them classified to a T--there's the mother woman--that's you. You're always mothering somebody with that maternal spirit of yours. It's a pity it's vicarious.\" I didn't say anything, not knowing just what he meant. But I've looked it up since and I guess he was about right. \"And there's the mistress woman--Mrs. Dicky, for example, or--\" he saw Miss Cobb's curler on the mantel and picked it up--\"or even Miss Cobb,\" he said. \"Coquetry and selfishness without maternal instinct. How much of Miss Cobb's virtue is training and environment, Minnie, not to mention lack of temptation, and how much was born in her?\"",

They're all selfish and they haven't enough virtue to make a fuss about.\" \"I'd be a shining light in the non-provider class,\" he said, and picking up his old cap he opened the door. Miss Patty herself was coming up the path. She was flushed from the cold air and from hurrying, and I don't know that I ever saw her look prettier. When she came into the light we could both see that she was dressed for dinner. Her fur coat was open at the neck, and she had only a lace scarf over her head. (She was a disbeliever in colds, anyhow, and all winter long she slept with the windows open and the steam-heat off!) \"I'm so glad you're still here, Minnie!\"",

About ten o'clock we got a telegram from the new doctor we'd been expecting, that he'd fallen on the ice on his way to the train and broken his arm, and at eleven a delegation from the guests waited on Mr. Pierce and told him they'd have to have a house physician at once. Senator Biggs was the spokesman. He said that, personally, he couldn't remain another day without one; that he should be under a physician's care every moment of his fast, and that if no doctor came that day he'd be in favor of all the guests showing their displeasure by leaving together. \"Either that,\" Thoburn said from the edge of the crowd, \"or call it a hotel at once and be done with it. A sanatorium without a doctor is like an omelet without eggs!\" \"Hamlet without ham,\" somebody said. \"We're doing the best we can,\" Mr. Pierce explained. \"We--we expect a doctor to-day.\" \"When?\" from Mr. Jennings, who had come on a cane and was watching Mr. Pierce like a hawk. \"This afternoon, probably.

You only needed to look at him to know that he took a cold plunge every morning, and liked to walk ten miles a day, and could digest anything and go to sleep the minute his head touched the pillow. And he had no tact. When Mrs. Biggs went to him and explained that the vacuum cleaner must not be used in her room--that it exhausted the air or something, and she could hardly breathe after it--he only looked bewildered and then drew a diagram to show her it was impossible that it could exhaust the air. The old doctor knew how: he'd have ordered an oxygen tank opened in the room after the cleaner was used and she'd have gone away happy. Of course Mr. Pierce was most polite. He'd listen to their complaints--and they were always complaining, that's part of the regime--with a puzzled face, trying to understand, but he couldn't. He hadn't a nerve in his body. Once, when one of the dining-room girls dropped a tray of dishes and half the women went to bed with headache from the nervous shock, he never even looked up, but went on with his dinner, and the only comment he made afterward was to tell the head waitress to see that Annie didn't have to pay breakage--that the trays were too heavy for a woman, anyhow.

I was down in the spring, but I heard it. \"So far you have hardly been an unalloyed joy,\" she replied, and from the spring I echoed \"Amen.\" \"Yes--I'm so hung with family skeletons that I clatter when I walk,\" I explained, pretending I hadn't heard, and brought them both glasses of water. \"It's got to be a habit with some people to save their sciatica and their husband's dispositions and their torpid livers and their unpaid bills and bring 'em here to me.\" He sniffed at the glass and put it down. \"Herr Gott!\" he said, \"what a water! It is--the whole thing is extraordinary! I can understand the reason for Carlsbad or Wiesbaden--it is gay.",

Every time somebody laid down a queen, he'd say, \"Is the queen still living, or didn't she die a few years ago?\" And when they played the knave, they'd start off about the prince again. They'd all decided that Mr. von Inwald was noble--somebody said that the \"von\" was a sort of title. The women were planning to make the evenings more cheerful, too. They couldn't have a dance with the men using canes or forbidden to exercise, but Miss Cobb had a lot of what she called \"parlor games\" that she wanted to try out. \"Introducing the Jones family\" was one of them. In the afternoon Mr. von Inwald came out to the spring-house and sat around, very affable and friendly, drinking the water. He and the bishop grew quite chummy.

Senator Biggs was the one who really caused the trouble. He spent a good deal of time in the spring-house trying to fool his stomach by keeping it filled up all the time with water. He had got past the cranky stage, being too weak for it; his face was folded up in wrinkles like an accordion and his double chin was so flabby you could have tucked it away inside his collar. \"What do you think of American women, Mr. von Inwald?\" he asked, and everybody stopped playing cards and listened for the answer. As Mr. von Inwald represented the prince, wouldn't he be likely to voice the prince's opinion of American women? It's my belief Mr. von Inwald was going to say something nice. He smiled as if he meant to, but just then he saw Mr. Pierce in his corner sneering behind his pipe. They looked at each other steadily, and nobody could mistake the hate in Mr. Pierce's face or his sneer.

Mr. Pierce was still staring at the prince. \"What I don't quite understand, Mr. von Inwald,\" the bishop put in in his nice way, \"is your custom of expecting a girl to bring her husband a certain definite sum of money and to place it under the husband's control. Our wealthy American girls control their own money,\" He was thinking of Miss Patty, and everybody knew it. The prince turned red and glared at the bishop.

Suppose I stay here and help. If I watch that line of knitting women I'll be crotcheting Arabella's wool in my sleep to-night.\" Well, she was too cheerful to be angry with. So she stayed around for a while, and it was amazing how much tobacco I sold that evening. Men who usually bought tobies bought the best cigars, and when Mr. Jennings came up, scowling, and I handed him the brand he'd smoked for years, she took one, clipped the end of it as neat as a finger nail and gave it to him, holding up the lighter.",

But she only smiled. \"I'm sorry,\" she said. \"I've been waiting hungrily until some discriminating smoker would buy one of those and light it. I love the aroma.\" And he stood there for thirty minutes, standing mostly on one foot on account of the gouty one, puffing like a locomotive, with her sniffing at the aroma and telling him how lonely she felt with no friends around and just recovering from a severe illness. At eight o'clock he had Mrs. Hutchins bring him his fur-lined coat and he and Miss Julia took Arabella, the dog, for a walk on the veranda! The rest of the evening was quiet, and I needed it. Miss Patty and Mr. von Inwald talked by the fire and I think he told her something--not all--of the scene in the spring-house. For she passed Mr. Pierce at the foot of the stairs on her way up for the night and she pretended not to see him. He stood there looking up after her with his mouth set, and at the turn she glanced down and caught his eye. I thought she flushed, but I wasn't sure, and at that minute Senator Biggs bought three twenty-five-cent cigars and told me to keep the change from a dollar. I was so surprised at the alteration in him that I forgot Miss Patty entirely. About twelve o'clock, just after I went to my room, somebody knocked at the door. When I opened, the new doctor was standing in the hall.",

What's the matter with him? Too much fast?\" \"Fast!\" He laughed. \"Too much feast! He's got as pretty a case of indigestion as I've seen for some time. He's giving a demonstration that's almost theatrical.\" Well, he insisted it was indigestion, although I argued that it wasn't possible, and he wanted ipecac. \"I haven't seen a pharmacopoeia for so long that I wouldn't know one if I met it,\" he declared, \"but I've got a system of mnemonics that never fails. Ipecac and colic both end with 'c'--I'll never forget that conjunction. It was pounded in and poured in in my early youth.\" Well, the pharmacy was locked, and we couldn't find a key to fit it. And when I suggested mustard and warm water he jumped at the idea. \"Fine!\" he said. \"Better let me dish out the spring-water and you take my job! Lead on, MacDuff, to the kitchen.\" Although it was only midnight there was not a soul about. A hall leads back of the office to the kitchen and pantries, and there was a low light there, but the rest was dark.",

The kitchen is dark, but there is somebody in there, fumbling around, striking matches. I suppose you don't have such things as burglars in this neck of the woods?\" Well, somebody had broken into Timmons' candy store a week before and stolen a box of chewing-gum and a hundred post-cards, and I told him so in a whisper. \"Anyhow, it isn't the chef,\" I said. \"He's had a row with the bath man and is in bed with a cut hand and a black eye, and nobody else has any business here.\" We tiptoed into the scullery in the dark: just then somebody knocked a kettle down in the kitchen and it hit the stove below with a crash. Whoever was there swore, and it was not Francois, who expresses his feelings mostly in French. This was English. There's a little window from the kitchen into the scullery as well as a door. The window had a wooden slide and it was open an inch or so. We couldn't see anything, but we could hear a man moving around. Once he struck a match, but it went out and he said \"Damn!\" again, and began to feel his way toward the scullery. Doctor Barnes happened to touch my hand and he patted it as if to tell me not to be frightened. Then he crept toward the scullery door and waited there.",

He was as bewildered as Mr. Dick and pretty nearly as mad. We put him--Mr. Dick--in a chair and gave him a glass of water, and after he had got his breath--the doctor being a heavy man--he said he was trying to find something to eat. \"Confound it, Minnie,\" he exclaimed, \"we're starving! It seems to me there are enough of you here at least to see that we are fed. Not a bite since lunch!\" \"But I thought you had the basket,\" I explained. \"I left it at the spring-house, and when I went back it was gone.\" \"So that was it!\" he answered. And then he explained that just about the time they expected their supper they saw a man carry a basket stealthily through the snow to the deer park. It was twilight, but they watched him from the window, and he put the basket through the barbed-wire fence and then crawled after it.

I tried to see Mr. Pierce, but early as it was he had gone for a walk, taking Arabella with him. So I called a conference at the shelter-house--Miss Patty, Mr. and Mrs. Van Alstyne, Mr. and Mrs. Dick, and myself. Mrs. Dick wasn't dressed, but she sat up on the edge of her cot in her dressing-gown, with her feet on the soap box, and yawned. As we didn't have enough chairs, Miss Patty jerked the soap box away and made me sit down. Mr. Dick was getting breakfast. We were in a tight place and we knew it. \"He is making it as hard for us as he can,\" Mrs. Sam declared. \"The idea of having the card-room lights put out at midnight, and the breakfast room closed at ten! Nobody gets up at that hour.\" \"He was to come here every evening for orders,\" said Mr. Dick, measuring ground coffee with a tablespoon, as I had showed him. \"He came just once, and as for orders--well, he gave 'em to me!\" But Miss Patty was always fair. \"I loathe him,\" she asserted. \"I want to quarrel with him the minute I see him. He--he is presumptuous to the point of impertinence--but he's honest: he thinks we're all hypocrites--those that are well and those that are sick or think they are--and he hates hypocrisy.\"",

Something is going to explode, and Oskar doesn't like to be agitated.\" She curled up on the cot with that and went sound asleep. The rest of us had coffee and talked, but there wasn't anything to do. As Mr. Sam said, Mr. Pierce didn't want to stay, anyhow, and as likely as not if we went to him in a body and told him he must come to the shelter-house for instructions, and be suave and gentle when he was called down by the guests about the steam-pipes making a racket, he'd probably prefer to go down to the village and take Doctor Barnes' place washing dishes at the station. That wouldn't call for any particular mildness. But he settled it by appearing himself. He came across the snow from the direction of Mount Hope, and he had a pair of skees over his shoulder. (At that time I didn't even know the name of the things, but I learned enough about them later.) I must say he looked very well beside Mr. Dick, who wasn't very large, anyhow, and who hadn't had time to put on his collar, and Mr.",

Miss Patty gave a little cry and took them, cuddling them in her lap. \"They're starving and almost frozen, poor little devils,\" he said. \"I found them near where I shot the mother last night, Minnie, and by way of atonement I'm going to adopt them.\" Well, although the minute before they'd all been wishing they'd never seen him, they pretty nearly ate him up. Miss Patty held the rabbits, so we all had turns at feeding them warm milk with a teaspoon and patting their pink noses. When it came Mr. Pierce's turn they were about full up, so he curled his big body on the floor at Miss Patty's feet and talked to the rabbits and looked at her. He had one of those faces that's got every emotion marked on it as clear as a barometer--when he was mad his face was mad all over, and when he was pleased he glowed to the tips of his ears. And he was pleased that morning. But, of course, he had to be set right about the sanatorium, and Mr. Sam began it.",

The hand covered my mouth at that, and something long and white and very thin beside the bed said: \"Sh! For heaven's sake, Minnie!\" It was Miss Cobb! It was lucky I came to my senses when I did, for her knees gave way under her just then and she doubled up on the floor beside the bed with her face in my comfort.

   "text": "NO MARRIAGE IN HEAVEN I slept late the next morning, and when I'd had breakfast and waded to the spring-house it was nearly nine. It was still snowing, and no papers or mail had got through, although the wires were still in fair working order. As I floundered out I thought I saw somebody slink around the corner of the spring-house, but when I got there nobody was in sight. I was on my knees in front of the fireplace, raking out the fire, when I heard the door close behind me, and when I turned, there stood Mr. Dick, muffled to the neck, with his hat almost over his face. \"What the deuce kept you so late this morning?\" he demanded, in a sulky voice, and limping over to a table he drew a package out of his pocket and slammed it on the table. \"I was up half the night, as usual,\" I said, rising. \"You oughtn't to be here, Mr. Dick!\" He caught hold of the rail around the spring, and hobbling about, dropped into a chair with a groan. \"For two cents,\" he declared, \"I'd chop a hole in the ice pond and drown myself. There's no marriage in Heaven.\" \"That's no argument for the other place,\" I answered, and stopped, staring. He was pulling something out of his overcoat pocket, an inch at a time. \"For God's sake, Minnie,\" he exclaimed, \"return this--this garment to--whomever it belongs to!\" He handed it to me, and it was Miss Cobb's black tights! I stood and stared. \"And then,\" he went on, reaching for the package on the table, \"when you've done that, return to 'Binkie'",

Only not on the right leg, Minnie--not on the right leg. I landed on it last night; it's twisted like a pretzel.\" \"Don't stand and stare,\" he continued irritably, when I didn't make a move, \"at least get that--that infernal black garment out of sight. Cover it with the newspaper. And if you don't believe that a sweet-faced young girl like my wife has a positive talent for wickedness and suspicion, go out to the shelter-house this morning.\" \"So it was you!\" I gasped, putting the newspaper over the tights. \"Why in the name of peace did you jump out the window, and what did you want with--with these things?\" He twisted around in his chair to stare at me, and then stooped and clutched frantically at his leg, as if for inspiration. \"Want with those things!\" he snarled. \"I suppose you can't understand that a man might wake up in the middle of the night with a mad craving for a pair of black woolen tights, and--\" \"You needn't be sarcastic with me,\" I broke in. \"You can save that for your wife.

She's got the door locked. Didn't I tell you she is of a suspicious nature? She was asleep when I left, and mostly she sleeps all night. And just because she wakes when I'm out, and lets me come in thinking she's asleep, when she has one eye open all the time, and she sees what I'd never even seen myself--that the string of that damned garment, whatever it is, is fastened to the hook of my shoe, me thinking all the time that the weight was because I'd broken my leg jumping--doesn't she suddenly sit up and ask me where I've been?

I made a leap for the door, just as the handle turned, and put my back against it. \"Just a minute,\" I called. \"The carpet is caught under it!\" Mr. Dick had lost his head and was making for the spring, as if he thought hiding his feet would conceal him. I made frantic gestures to him to go into my pantry, and he went at last, leaving his hat on the table, I left the door and flung it after him--the hat, of course, not the door--and when Miss Summers sauntered in just after, I was on my knees brushing the hearth, with my heart going three-four time and skipping every sixth beat. \"Hello!\" she said. \"Lovely weather--for polar bears. If the natives wade through this all winter it's no wonder they walk as if they are ham-strung. Don't bother getting me a glass. I'll get my own.\" She was making for the pantry when I caught her, and I guess I looked pretty wild. \"I'll get it,\" I said. \"I--that's one of the rules.\" She put her hands in the pockets of her white sweater and smiled at me. \"Do you know,\" she declared, \"the old ladies' knitting society isn't so far wrong about you!

But she only laughed and sat down on a table, swinging her feet. \"When you know me better, Minnie,\" she said, \"you'll know I don't spoil sport. I happen to know you have somebody in the pantry--moreover, I know it's a man. There are tracks on the little porch, my dear girl, not made by your galoshes.

I shall take my little drink of nature's benevolent remedy out of the tin ladle, and then--I shall take my departure!\" My heart was skipping every second beat by that time, and Miss Julia stood by the pantry door, her head back and her eyes almost closed, enjoying every minute of it.

Mrs. Sam didn't look at her. \"Good morning, Mrs. Van Alstyne!\" Miss Summers almost threw it at her. \"I spoke to you before; I guess you didn't hear me.\" \"Oh, yes, I heard you,\" answered Mrs. Sam, and turned her back on her.

During the golf season Saturday is always a busy day with us, with the husbands coming up for over Sunday, and trying to get in all the golf, baths and spring water they can in forty-eight hours. But in the winter Saturday is the same as any, other day. It had stopped snowing and the sun was shining, although it was so cold that the snow blew like powder. By eleven o'clock every one who could walk had come to the spring-house. Even Mr. Jennings came down in a wheeled chair, and Senator Biggs, still looking a sort of grass-green and keeping his eyes off me, came and sat in a corner, with a book called Fast versus Feast held so that every one could see. There were bridge tables going, and five hundred, and a group around the slot-machine, while the crocheters formed a crowd by themselves, exchanging gossip and new stitches. About twelve o'clock Mr. Thoburn came in, and as he opened the door, in leaped Arabella. The women made a fuss over the creature and cuddled her, and when I tried to put her out everybody objected. So she stayed, and Miss Summers put her through a lot of tricks, while the men crowded around. As I said before, Miss Summers was a first favorite with the men. Mr. von Inwald and Miss Patty came in just then and stood watching. \"And now,\" said Mr. von Inwald, \"I propose, as a reward to Miss Arabella, a glass of this wonderful water.",

Besides, the little beggar's thirsty.\" Well, they made a great fuss about the creature's being thirsty, and so finally I got a panful of spring water and it drank until I thought it would burst. I'm not vicious, as I say, but I wish it had. Well, the dog finished and lay down by the fire, and everything seemed to go on as before. Mr. Thoburn was in a good humor, and he came over to the spring and brought a trayful of glasses. \"To save you steps, Minnie!\" he explained. \"You have no idea how it pains me to see you working. Gentlemen, name your poison!\" \"A frappe with blotting-paper on the side,\" Mr. Moody snarled from the slot-machine. \"If I drink much more, I'll have to be hooped up like a barrel.\" \"Just what is the record here?\" the bishop asked. \"I'm ordered eight glasses, but I find it more than a sufficiency.\" \"We had one man here once who could drink twenty-five at a time,\" I said, \"but he was a German.\" \"He was a tank,\" Mr. Sam corrected grumpily.

From the spring I looked again at father, and his eyes were on me mournful and sad. I felt as though, if he'd been there, father would have turned the whole affair to the advantage of the house, and it was almost more than I could bear. I was only glad the old doctor's enlargement had not come yet. I couldn't have endured having it see what had occurred. The only thing I could think of was to empty the spring and let the water come in plain. I could put a little sulphur in to give it color and flavor, and if it turned out that Mr. Pierce was right and that Arabella was only a glutton, I could put in the other things later.

'A quart of ale is a dish for a king,'\" he said, holding up a glass. \"That's Shakespeare, Miss Minnie.\" I was a good bit more cheerful when I'd choked down the sandwich, especially when he assured me the water was all right--\"a little high, as you might say, but not poisonous.

The rest followed, their red faces shining through the steam--all of them murderous, holding their sheets around them with one hand, and waving the other in a frenzy. It was awful. The help scattered and ran, but I stood my ground. The sight of a man in a sheet didn't scare me and it was no time for weakness. The steam was thicker than ever, and the hall was misty. A moment later the engineer came up and after him Mr. Pierce, with a towel over his mouth and a screw-driver in his hand. He was white with rage. He brushed past the sheets without paying the slightest attention to them, and tore the towel off his mouth. \"Who saw Mike last?\" he shouted across to where the pharmacy clerk, the elevator boy and some of the bell-boys had retreated to the office and were peeping out through the door. Here Mr. Moody, who's small at any time, and who without the padding on his shoulders and wrapped in a sheet with his red face above, looked like a lighted cigarette, darted out of the crowd and caught him by the sleeve. \"Here!\" he cried, \"we've got a few things to say to you, you young--\"",

Doctor Barnes forced his way through the crowd and stood there beside him. It wasn't only the steam and their clothes being hidden; it had started with the scare at the spring in the morning, and when they had told him what they thought about that, they went back still further and bellowed about the mismanagement of the place ever since he had taken charge, and the food, and the steam-heat, and the new rules--oh, they hated him all right, and they told him so, purple-faced with rage and heat, dancing around him and shaking one fist in his face, as I say, while they held their sheets fast with the other. And I stood there and watched, my mind awhirl, expecting every minute to hear that they were all leaving, or to have some one forget and shake both fists at once. And that's how it ended finally--I mean, of course, that they said they would all leave immediately, and that he ought to be glad to have them go quietly, and not have him jailed for malicious mischief or compounding a felony. The whole thing was an outrage, and the three train would leave the house as empty as a squeezed lemon. I wanted to go forward and drop on my knees and implore them to remember the old doctor, and the baths they'd had when nothing went wrong, and the days when they'd sworn that the spring kept them young and well, but there was something in Mr.",

Mrs. Moody had forgotten her crocheting bag and it hung on the back of a chair. I had to bite my lip to keep it from trembling again. \"The Jenningses are still here,\" said the doctor. \"The old man is madder than any hornet ever dared be, and they go in the morning.

There wasn't a soul in sight. The place looked lonely, with the trees hung with snow, and arching over the board walk. At the little bridge over the creek Doctor Barnes stopped, and leaning over the rail, took a good look at me. \"When you self-contained women go to pieces,\" he said, \"you pretty near smash, don't you?

She simply picked up the howling dog and confronted Mr. von Inwald. \"Perhaps you didn't notice,\" she said sweetly, \"but you kicked my dog.\" \"Why don't you keep her out of the way?\" he snarled, and they stood glaring at each other. \"Under the circumstances, Arabella,\" Miss Julia said--and everybody was listening--\"we can only withdraw Mr. von Inwald's invitation to the kitchen.\" \"Thank you, I had not intended to go,\" he said furiously, and went out into the veranda, slamming the door behind him. Mr. Jennings looked up from where he was playing chess by the fire and nodded at Miss Summers. \"Serves him right for his temper!\" he said. \"Checkmate!\" said the bishop. Mr. Jennings turned and glared at the board. Then with one sweep he threw all the chessmen on the floor. As Tillie said later, it would be a pity to spoil two houses with Mr. von Inwald and Mr. Jennings If they were in the same family, they could work it off on each other. Miss Patty came down to the news stand and pretended to hunt for a magazine.",

They were really very cheerful, all of them. Doctor Barnes insisted that Senator Biggs must not fast any longer, and he ate by my count three dozen clams. At the end, when everybody was happy and everything forgiven, Mr. Pierce got up and made a speech. He said he was sorry for what had happened that day, but that much he had said he still maintained: that to pretend to make people well in the way most sanatoriums did it was sheer folly, and he felt his responsibility too keenly to countenance a system that was clearly wrong and that the best modern thought considered obsolete.",

Mrs. Moody looked alarmed. \"You don't mean doing without clothes--and all that!\" she protested. \"Surely!\" Miss Summers said, holding up her beer glass. \"A toast, everybody! Back to nature, sans rats, sans rouge, sans stays, sans everything. I'll need to wear a tag with my name on it. Nobody will recognize me!\" Mr. Pierce got up again at the head of the long kitchen table and said he merely meant rational living--more air, more exercise, simpler food and better hours. It was being done now in a thousand fresh-air farms, and succeeding. Men went back to their business clearer-headed and women grew more beautiful. At that, what with the reaction from sitting in the cold station, and the beer and everything, they all grew enthusiastic. Doctor Barnes made a speech, telling that he used to be puny and weak, and how he went into training and became a pugilist, and how he'd fought the Tennessee something or other--the men nodded as if they knew--and licked him in forty seconds or forty rounds, I'm not sure which.",

Mr. Thoburn got up and made a speech, protesting that they didn't know what they were letting themselves in for, and ended up by demanding to know if he was expected to breakfast at seven-thirty. \"Yes, or earlier,\" Mr. Pierce said pleasantly. \"I suppose you could have something at seven.\" \"And suppose I refuse?\" he retorted disagreeably.

I ought to have been glad. I was, although when Mrs. Dicky found they were all staying, and that she might have to live in the shelter-house the rest of the winter, there was an awful scene. I was glad, too, every time I could see Mr. Thoburn's gloomy face, or hear the things he said when his name went up for the military walk. (Oh yes, we had a blackboard in the hall, and every morning each guest looked to see if it was wood-pile day or military-walk day. At first, instead of wood-pile, it was walk-clearing day, but they soon had the snow off all the paths.) As I say, I was glad. It looked as if the new idea was a success, although as Doctor Barnes said, nobody could really tell until new people began to come. That was the real test. They had turned the baths into a gymnasium and they had beginners' classes and advanced classes, and a prize offered on the blackboard of a cigar for the man who made the most muscular improvement in a week. The bishop won it the first week, being the only one who could lie on his back and raise himself to a sitting position without helping himself with his hands.",

I was lonesome for it! I hadn't much to do, except from two to four to be at the spring-house, and to count for the deep-breathing exercise. Oh, yes, we had that, too! I rang a bell every half-hour and everybody got up, and I counted slowly \"one\" and they breathed in through their noses, and \"two\" and they exhaled quickly through their mouths. I guess most of them used more of their lungs than they ever knew they had. Well, everybody looked better and felt better, although they wouldn't all acknowledge it. Miss Cobb suffered most, not having the fire log to curl her hair with. But as she said herself, between gymnasium and military walks, and the silence hour, and eating, which took a long time, everybody being hungry--and going to bed at nine, she didn't see how she could have worried with it, anyhow. The fat ones, of course, objected to an apple and a cup of hot water for breakfast, but except Mr. Thoburn, they all realized it was for the best.

She doesn't know I exist, except to invent new and troublesome regulations for her annoyance. She is very sweet when she meets me, but only because I am helping her to have her own way. And I--my God, Minnie, I sit in the office and listen for her step outside!\" He moved a little and held out the paper in the candle-light. \"'It will please Americans to know,'\" he read, \"'that with the exception of the Venetian lace robe sent by the bridegroom's mother, all of Miss Patricia Jennings' elaborate trousseau is being made in America. \"'Prince Oskar and his suite, according to present arrangements, will sail from Naples early in March, and the wedding date, although not yet definitely fixed, will probably be the first week in April.",

I was only the spring-house girl, but I was older than he was, and he needed somebody to comfort him. \"I can't think of anything to say that will help any,\" I said, \"unless it's what you wrote yourself on the blackboard down in the hall, 'Keep busy and you'll keep happy.'\" He reached up for my hand, and rough and red as it was--having been in the spring for so many years--he kissed it. \"Good for you, Minnie!\" he said. \"You're rational, and for a day or so I haven't been. That's right, KEEP BUSY. I'll do it.\" He got up and put his hands on my shoulders. \"Good old pal, when you see me going around as if all the devils of hell were tormenting me, just come up and say that to me, will you?\" I promised, and he opened the door, candle in hand, and smiling. \"I'm a thousand per cent. better already,\" he said. \"I just needed to tell somebody, I think. I dare say I've made a lot more fuss than it really deserves.\" At the far end of the hall, a girl came out of one room, and carrying a candle, went across to another. It was Miss Patty, going to bid her father good night. When I left, he was still staring down the hall after her, his candle dripping wax on the floor, and his face white.

And they were pleasant. They'd sit down to a supper of ham and eggs and apple sauce, and yell for more apple sauce, and every evening in the billiard room they got up two weighing pools, one for the ones who wanted to reduce, and one for the people who wanted to gain. Everybody put in a dollar, and at gymnasium hour the next morning the ones who'd gained or lost the most won the pool. Mr. Thoburn won the losing pool on Thursday and Friday--he didn't want to lose weight, but he was compelled to under the circumstances. And I think worry helped him to it. They fussed some still about sleeping with the windows open, especially the bald-headed men. However, the bishop, who had been bald for thirty years, was getting a fine down all over the top of his head, and this encouraged the rest. The bishop says it is nature's instinct to protect itself from cold--all animals have fur, and heavier fur in winter--and he believed that it was the ultimate cure for baldness. Men lose their hair on top, he said, because they wear hats, and so don't need it. But let the top of the head need protection, and lo, hair comes there. Although, as Mr. Thoburn said, his nose was always cold in winter, and nature never did anything for IT.",

She walked over to where I was polishing the brass railing around the spring--it had been the habit of years, and not easy to break--and stood looking at me and breathing hard. \"Minnie,\" she exclaimed, \"I have found the thief!\" \"Lord have mercy!\" I said, and dropped the brass polish. \"I have found the thief!\" she repeated firmly. \"Minnie, our sins always find us out.\" \"I guess they do,\" I said shakily, and sat down on the steps to the spring. \"Oh, Miss Cobb, if only he would use a little bit of sense!\" \"He?\" she said. \"HE nothing! It's that Summers woman I'm talking about, Minnie. I knew that woman wasn't what she ought to be the minute I set eyes on her.\" \"The Summers woman!\" I repeated.

Miss Patty had got almost to the top and was standing there on one snow-covered rail, staring across at me through the darkness. \"I can't, Minnie,\" she whispered hopelessly. \"I never could climb a fence, and in this skirt--!\" \"Quick!\" I said in a low tone. The lantern was very close. \"Put your leg over.\" She did, and sat there looking down at me like a scared baby.",

I dropped beside her. \"What was that noise?\" said Mr. Thoburn, almost upon us. \"Something's moving inside that fence corner.\" \"It's them deers,\" Mike's voice this time. We could make out the three figures. \"Darned nuisance, them deers is. They'd have been shot long ago if the spring-house girl hadn't objected. She thinks she's the whole cheese around here.\" \"Set it down again,\" Mr. von Inwald panted. We heard the rattle of bottles as they put down the basket, and the next instant Thoburn's fat hand was resting on the rail of the fence over our heads. I could feel Miss Patty trembling beside me. But he didn't look over. He stood there resting, breathing hard, and swearing at the weather, while Mike waited, in surly silence, and the von Inwald cursed in German. After my heart had been beating in my ears for about three years the fat hand moved, and I heard the rattle of glass again and Thoburn's groan as he bent over his half of the load. \"'Come on, my partners in distress, My comrades through this wilderness,'\" he said, and the others grunted and started on. When they had disappeared in the snow we got out of our cramped position and prepared to scurry home.",

She was flat on the snow, crawling between the two lower rails of the fence. \"Have you no shame?\" I demanded. She looked up at me with her head and half her long sealskin coat through the fence. \"None,\" she said pitifully. \"Minnie, I'm stuck perfectly tight!\" \"You ought to be left as you are,\" I said, jerking at her, \"for people to come\"--jerk--\"to-morrow to look at\"--jerk. She came through at that, and we lay together in the snow and like to burst a rib laughing. \"You'll never be a princess, Miss Patty,\" I declared. \"You're too lowly minded.\" She sat up suddenly and straightened her sealskin cap on her head. \"I wish,\" she said unpleasantly, \"I wish you wouldn't always drag in disagreeable things, Minnie!\" And she was sulky all the way to the house. Miss Summers came to my room that night as I was putting my hot-water bottle to bed, in a baby-blue silk wrapper with a band of fur around the low neck--Miss Summers, of course, not the hot-water bottle. \"Well!\" she said, sitting down on the foot of the bed and staring at me. \"Well, young woman, for a person who has never been farther away than Finleyville you do pretty well!\" \"Do what?\" I asked, with the covers up to my chin. \"Do what, Miss Innocence!\" she said mockingly.",

They were planning a mutiny, as you may say, and I guess no sailors on a pirate ship were more afraid of the captain's fist than they were of Mr. Pierce's disapproval. He'd been smart enough to see that most of them, having bullied other people all their lives, liked the novelty of being bullied themselves. And now they were getting a new thrill by having a revolt. They were terribly worked up. Miss Patty stayed after the others had gone, sitting in front of the empty fireplace in the same chair Mr. Pierce usually took, and keeping her back to me.

She doesn't care for me; sometimes I think she hates me.\" He paused here, but Miss Patty didn't move. \"I haven't anything to offer a woman except a clean life and the kind of love that a woman could be proud of. I have no title--\" Miss Patty suddenly took her fingers out of her ears and turned around. She was flushed and shaken, but she looked past him without blinking an eyelash to me. \"Dear me,\" she said, \"the sermon must have been exciting, Minnie! You are quite trembly!\" And with that she picked up her muff and went out, with not a glance at him.",

Mrs. Dicky was sitting on a box, with her hair in puffs and the folding card-table before her, and Mr. Dick was uncorking a bottle of champagne with a nail. There were two or three queer-smelling cans open on the table. Mrs. Dick looked at my basket and turned up her nose. \"Put it anywhere, Minnie,\" she said loftily, \"I dare say it doesn't contain anything reckless.\" \"Cold ham and egg salad,\" I said, setting it down with a slam. \"Stewed prunes and boiled rice for dessert. If those cans taste as they smell, you'd better keep the basket to fall back on. Where'd you get THAT?\" Mr. Dick looked at me over the bottle and winked. \"In the next room,\" he said, \"iced to the proper temperature, paid for by somebody else, and coming after a two-weeks' drought! Minnie, there isn't a shadow on my joy!\" \"He'll miss it,\" I said. But Mr. Dick was pouring out three large tumblersful of the stuff, and he held one out to me. \"Miss it!\" he exclaimed. \"Hasn't he been out three times to-day, tapping his little CACHE? And didn't he bring out Moody and the senator and von Inwald this afternoon, and didn't they sit in the next room there from two to four, roaring songs and cracking bottles and jokes.\"",

Look at it, lying there, neglected in a corner, with p--perfectly good ham and stewed fruit in it.\" All of a sudden I felt terrible about the way they had treated the basket, and I sat down on the steps and began to cry.

Then I realized that the knocking wasn't all in my head. There was a sort of steady movement of feet on the other side of the door, with people talking and laughing. And above it all rose the steady knock--knock of somebody beating on tin. \"Can't do it.\" It was the bishop's voice. \"I am convinced that nothing but dynamite will open this tin of lobster.\" \"Just a moment, Bishop,\" Mr. Thoburn's voice and the clink of bottles, \"I have a can opener somewhere. You'll find the sauce a la Newburg--\" \"Here, somebody, a glass, quick! A bottle's broken!\" \"Did anybody remember to bring salt and pepper?\" \"DEAR Mr. Thoburn!\" It sounded like Miss Cobb. \"Think of thinking of all this!\" \"The credit is not mine, dear lady,\" Mr. Thoburn said. \"Where the deuce is that corkscrew? No, dear lady, man makes his own destiny, but his birth date remains beyond his control.\" \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" somebody said, \"to Mr. Thoburn's birthday being beyond his control!\" There was the clink of glasses, but I had remembered what it had been that I was to remember. And now it was too late. I was trapped in the pantry of my spring-house and Mr. Pierce was probably asleep. I clutched my aching head and tried to think.

Convicting us out of our own mouths.\" I held my breath and the knob rattled. Then they found a glass for Miss Patty and forgot the pantry. Under cover of the next burst of noises I tried the pantry window, but it was frozen shut. Nothing but a hammer would have loosened it. I began to dig at it with a wire hairpin, but I hadn't much hope. The fun in the spring-house was getting fast and furious. Miss Summers was leaning against the pantry door and I judged that most of the men in the room were around her, as usual. I put my ear to the panel of the door, and I could pretty nearly see what was going on. They were toasting Mr. Thoburn, and getting hungrier every minute as the supper was put out on the card-tables. \"To the bottle!\" somebody said. \"In infancy, the milk bottle; in our prime, the wine bottle; in our dotage, the pill bottle.\" Mr. von Inwald came over and stood beside Miss Summers, and I could hear every whisper. \"I have good news for you,\" she said in an undertone.",

And when he cooled down and condensed, as you may say, into English, he said Miss Jennings must have seen the letters, for she would hardly speak to him. And Miss Summers said she hoped Miss Jennings had--she was too nice a girl to treat shamefully. And after he had left her there alone, I heard a sort of scratching on the door behind Miss Summers' back, and then something being shoved under the door. I stooped down and picked it up. It was a key! I struck a match, and I saw by the tag that it was the one to the old doctor's rooms. I knew right off what it meant. Mr. Pierce had gone to bed, or pretended to throw them off the track and Thoburn had locked him in! Thoburn hadn't taken any chances. He knew the influence Mr. Pierce had over them all, and he and his champagne and tin cans had to get in their work before Mr. Pierce had another chance at them.

I worked frantically with the hairpin, and just then two shadowy figures outside slipped around the corner of the building. It was Mr. Pierce and Doctor Barnes! I darted back and put my ear to the door, but they did not come in at once. Mr. Thoburn made a speech, saying how happy he was that they were all well and able to go back to civilization again, where the broiled lobster flourished like a green bay tree and the prune and the cabbage were unknown. There was loud applause, and then Senator Biggs cleared his throat. \"Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished fellow guests,\" he began, \"I suggest a toast to the autocrat of Hope Springs. It is the only blot on the evening, that, owing to the exigencies of the occasion, he can not be with us. Securely fastened in his room, he is now sleeping the sleep that follows a stomach attuned to prunes, a mind attuned to rule.\" \"Eat, drink and be merry!\" somebody said, \"for to-morrow you diet!\" There was a swish and rustle, as if a woman got up in a hurry. \"Do you mean,\" said Miss Patty's clear voice, \"that you have dared to lock Mr. Pier--Mr. Carter in his room?\" \"My dear young lady,\" several of them began, but she didn't give them time. \"It is outrageous, infamous!\"",

It won't be necessary.\" The voice came from the door, and a hush fell on the party. I slipped my bolt and peeped out. Framed in the doorway was Mr. Pierce, with Doctor Barnes looking over his shoulder. The people in the spring-house were abject. That's the only word for it. Craven, somebody suggested later, and they were that, too. They smiled sickly grins and tried to be defiant, and most of them tried to put down whatever they held in their hands and to look innocent. If you ever saw a boy when his school-teacher asks him what he has in his mouth, and multiply the boy thirty times in number and four times in size, you'll know how they looked. Mr. Pierce never smiled. He wouldn't let them speak a word in defense or explanation. He simply lined them up as he did at gym, and sent them, one by one, to the corner with whatever they had in their hands.",
