   "text": "MISS BILLY'S DECISION CHAPTER I. CALDERWELL DOES SOME TALKING Calderwell had met Mr. M. J. Arkwright in London through a common friend; since then they had tramped half over Europe together in a comradeship that was as delightful as it was unusual. As Calderwell put it in a letter to his sister, Belle: “We smoke the same cigar and drink the same tea (he's just as much of an old woman on that subject as I am!), and we agree beautifully on all necessary points of living, from tipping to late sleeping in the morning; while as for politics and religion--we disagree in those just enough to lend spice to an otherwise tame existence.” Farther along in this same letter Calderwell touched upon his new friend again."

I am about ready to pick his pocket or rifle his trunk in search of some lurking 'Martin' or 'John' that will set me at peace. As it is, I confess that I have ogled his incoming mail and his outgoing baggage shamelessly, only to be slapped in the face always and everlastingly by that bland 'M. J.' I've got my revenge, now, though. To myself I call him 'Mary Jane'--and his broad-shouldered, brown-bearded six feet of muscular manhood would so like to be called 'Mary Jane'!"

   "text": "By the way, Belle, if you ever hear of murder and sudden death in my direction, better set the sleuths on the trail of Arkwright. Six to one you'll find I called him 'Mary Jane' to his face!” Calderwell was thinking of that letter now, as he sat at a small table in a Paris café. Opposite him was the six feet of muscular manhood, broad shoulders, pointed brown beard, and all--and he had just addressed it, inadvertently, as “Mary Jane.” During the brief, sickening moment of silence after the name had left his lips, Calderwell was conscious of a whimsical realization of the lights, music, and laughter all about him. “Well, I chose as safe a place as I could!” he was thinking. Then Arkwright spoke. “How long since you've been in correspondence with members of my family?”"

   "text": "Arkwright laughed grimly. “Perhaps you thought of it yourself, then--I'll admit you're capable of it,” he nodded, reaching for a cigar. “But it so happens you hit upon my family's favorite name for me.” “_Mary Jane!_ You mean they actually _call_ you that?” “Yes,” bowed the big fellow, calmly, as he struck a light. “Appropriate!--don't you think?” Calderwell did not answer. He thought he could not. “Well, silence gives consent, they say,” laughed the other. “Anyhow, you must have had _some_ reason for calling me that.” “Arkwright, what _does_ 'M. J.' stand for?” demanded Calderwell. “Oh, is that it?” smiled the man opposite."

One man declares they're 'Merely Jokes'; but another, not so friendly, says they stand for 'Mostly Jealousy' of more fortunate chaps who have real names for a handle. My small brothers and sisters, discovering, with the usual perspicacity of one's family on such matters, that I never signed, or called myself anything but 'M. J.,' dubbed me 'Mary Jane.' And there you have it.”"

   "text": "Arkwright smiled oddly. “Oh, well, what's the difference? Would you deprive them of their innocent amusement? And they do so love that 'Mary Jane'! Besides, what's in a name, anyway?” he went on, eyeing the glowing tip of the cigar between his fingers. “'A rose by any other name--'--you've heard that, probably. Names don't always signify, my dear fellow. For instance, I know a 'Billy'--but he's a girl.” Calderwell gave a sudden start. “You don't mean Billy--Neilson?” The other turned sharply. “Do _you_ know Billy Neilson?” Calderwell gave his friend a glance from scornful eyes. “Do I know Billy Neilson?” he cried."

Oh, I know I'm telling tales out of school, of course,” he went on, in response to the look that had come into the brown eyes opposite. “But what's the use? Everybody knows it--that knows us. Billy herself got so she took it as a matter of course--and refused as a matter of course, too; just as she would refuse a serving of apple pie at dinner, if she hadn't wanted it.” “Apple pie!” scouted Arkwright. Calderwell shrugged his shoulders. “My dear fellow, you don't seem to realize it, but for the last six months you have been assisting at the obsequies of a dead romance.” “Indeed!"

I think I was really convinced, for a while, that--that she didn't want that apple pie,” he finished with a whimsical lightness that did not quite coincide with the stern lines that had come to his mouth. For a moment there was silence, then Calderwell spoke again. “Where did you know--Miss Billy?” “Oh, I don't know her at all."

  {
   "size": 618,
   "text": "I know of her--through Aunt Hannah.” Calderwell sat suddenly erect. “Aunt Hannah! Is she your aunt, too? Jove! This _is_ a little old world, after all; isn't it?” “She isn't my aunt. She's my mother's third cousin. None of us have seen her for years, but she writes to mother occasionally; and, of course, for some time now, her letters have been running over full of Billy. She lives with her, I believe; doesn't she?” “She does,” rejoined Calderwell, with an unexpected chuckle. “I wonder if you know how she happened to live with her, at first.” “Why, no, I reckon not. What do you mean?” Calderwell chuckled again."

   "text": "“Well, I'll tell you. You, being a 'Mary Jane,' ought to appreciate it. You see, Billy was named for one William Henshaw, her father's chum, who promptly forgot all about her. At eighteen, Billy, being left quite alone in the world, wrote to 'Uncle William' and asked to come and live with him.”"

'The Strata,' Bertram called it. Bright boy--Bertram!” “Yes. I wish you could see that house, Arkwright. It's a regular layer cake. Cyril--he's the second brother; must be thirty-four or five now--lives on the top floor in a rugless, curtainless, music-mad existence--just a plain crank. Below him comes William. William collects things--everything from tenpenny nails to teapots, I should say, and they're all there in his rooms."

He's _the_ Bertram Henshaw, you understand; the artist.” “Not the 'Face-of-a-Girl' Henshaw?” “The same; only of course four years ago he wasn't quite so well known as he is now. Well, to resume and go on. It was into this house, this masculine paradise ruled over by Pete and Dong Ling in the kitchen, that Billy's naïve request for a home came.” “Great Scott!” breathed Arkwright, appreciatively. “Yes. Well, the letter was signed 'Billy.' They took her for a boy, naturally, and after something of a struggle they agreed to let 'him' come. For his particular delectation they fixed up a room next to Bertram with guns and fishing rods, and such ladylike specialties; and William went to the station to meet the boy.” “With never a suspicion?” “With never a suspicion.”"

Oh, there was a kitten, too, I believe, 'Spunk,' who added to the gayety of nations.” “But what did the Henshaws do?” “Well, I wasn't there, of course; but Bertram says they spun around like tops gone mad for a time, but finally quieted down enough to summon a married sister for immediate propriety, and to establish Aunt Hannah for permanency the next day.” “So that's how it happened! Well, by George!” cried Arkwright. “Yes,” nodded the other. “So you see there are untold possibilities just in a name. Remember that."

   "text": "Just suppose _you_, as Mary Jane, should beg a home in a feminine household--say in Miss Billy's, for instance!” “I'd like to,” retorted Arkwright, with sudden warmth. Calderwell stared a little. The other laughed shamefacedly. “Oh, it's only that I happen to have a devouring curiosity to meet that special young lady. I sing her songs (you know she's written some dandies!), I've heard a lot about her, and I've seen her picture.” (He did not add that he had also purloined that same picture from his mother's bureau--the picture being a gift from Aunt Hannah.) “So you see I would, indeed, like to occupy a corner in the fair Miss Billy's household."

   "text": "I could write to Aunt Hannah and beg a home with her, you know; eh?” “Of course! Why don't you--'Mary Jane'?” laughed Calderwell. “Billy'd take you all right. She's had a little Miss Hawthorn, a music teacher, there for months. She's always doing stunts of that sort. Belle writes me that she's had a dozen forlornites there all this last summer, two or three at a time-tired widows, lonesome old maids, and crippled kids--just to give them a royal good time. So you see she'd take you, without a doubt. Jove! what a pair you'd make: Miss Billy and Mr. Mary Jane! You'd drive the suffragettes into conniption fits--just by the sound of you!” Arkwright laughed quietly; then he frowned."
  },

   "text": "“But how about it?” he asked. “I thought she was keeping house with Aunt Hannah. Didn't she stay at all with the Henshaws?” “Oh, yes, a few months. I never knew just why she did leave, but I fancied, from something Billy herself said once, that she discovered she was creating rather too much of an upheaval in the Strata. So she took herself off. She went to school, and travelled considerably. She was over here when I met her first. After that she was with us all one summer on the yacht. A couple of years ago, or so, she went back to Boston, bought a house and settled down with Aunt Hannah.” “And she's not married--or even engaged?” “Wasn't the last I heard."
  },

I heard a month ago from Belle, and _she_ had a letter from Billy in August. But I heard nothing of any engagement.” “How about the Henshaws? I should think there might be a chance there for a romance--a charming girl, and three unattached men.” Calderwell gave a slow shake of the head. “I don't think so. William is--let me see--nearly forty-five, I guess, by this time; and he isn't a marrying man. He buried his heart with his wife and baby years ago. Cyril, according to Bertram, 'hates women and all other confusion,'"

   "text": "so that ought to let him out. As for Bertram himself--Bertram is 'only Bertram.' He's always been that. Bertram loves girls--to paint; but I can't imagine him making serious love to any one. It would always be the tilt of a chin or the turn of a cheek that he was admiring--to paint. No, there's no chance for a romance there, I'll warrant.” “But there's--yourself.” Calderwell's eyebrows rose the fraction of an inch. “Oh, of course. I presume January or February will find me back there,” he admitted with a sigh and a shrug. Then, a little bitterly, he added: “No, Arkwright. I shall keep away if I can. I _know_ there's no chance for me--now.” “Then you'll leave me a clear field?” bantered the other. “Of course--'Mary Jane,'” retorted Calderwell, with equal lightness."

   "text": "“Oh, you needn't,” laughed Calderwell. “My giving you the right of way doesn't insure you a thoroughfare for yourself--there are others, you know. Billy Neilson has had sighing swains about I her, I imagine, since she could walk and talk. She is a wonderfully fascinating little bit of femininity, and she has a heart of pure gold. All is, I envy the man who wins it--for the man who wins that, wins her.” There was no answer. Arkwright sat with his eyes on the moving throng outside the window near them. Perhaps he had not heard. At all events, when he spoke some time later, it was of a matter far removed from Miss Billy Neilson, or the way to her heart."

Long hours later, just before parting for the night, Arkwright said: “Calderwell, I'm sorry, but I believe, after all, I can't take that trip to the lakes with you. I--I'm going home next week.” “Home! Hang it, Arkwright! I'd counted on you. Isn't this rather sudden?” “Yes, and no. I'll own I've been drifting about with you contentedly enough for the last six months to make you think mountain-climbing and boat-paddling were the end and aim of my existence. But they aren't, you know, really.” “Nonsense! At heart you're as much of a vagabond as I am; and you know it.” “Perhaps."

But something besides my education has got to be supplemented now, I reckon.” “What are you going to do?” There was an almost imperceptible hesitation; then, a little shortly, came the answer: “Hit the trail for Grand Opera, and bring up, probably--in vaudeville.” Calderwell smiled appreciatively. “You _can_ sing like the devil,” he admitted. “Thanks,” returned his friend, with uplifted eyebrows. “Do you mind calling it 'an angel'--just for this occasion?” “Oh, the matinée-girls will do that fast enough.

By the way, you didn't say what that 'M. J.' really did stand for,” hinted Calderwell, shamelessly. “'Merely Jokes'--in your estimation, evidently,” shrugged the other. “But my going isn't a joke, Calderwell. I'm really going. And I'm going to work.” “But--how shall you manage?” Calderwell frowned and stirred restlessly in his chair. “But, honestly, now, to--to follow that trail of yours will take money. And--er--” a faint red stole to his forehead--“don't they have--er--patrons for these young and budding geniuses?"

I'd be no end glad to, Arkwright.” “Thanks, old man.” The red was duplicated this time above the brown silky beard. “That was mighty kind of you, and I appreciate it; but it won't be necessary. A generous, but perhaps misguided bachelor uncle left me a few thousands a year or so ago; and I'm going to put them all down my throat--or rather, _into_ it--before I give up.” “Where you going to study? New York?” Again there was an almost imperceptible hesitation before the answer came. “I'm not quite prepared to say.” “Why not try it here?” Arkwright shook his head."

There was a brief silence, followed by other questions and other answers; after which the friends said good night. In his own room, as he was dropping off to sleep, Calderwell muttered drowsily: “By George! I haven't found out yet what that blamed 'M. J.' stands for!”"

Her pen had just traced the date, “October twenty-fifth,” when Mrs. Stetson entered with a letter in her hand. “Writing, my dear? Then don't let me disturb you.” She turned as if to go. Billy dropped her pen, sprang to her feet, flew to the little woman's side and whirled her half across the room. “There!” she exclaimed, as she plumped the breathless and scandalized Aunt Hannah into the biggest easy chair. “I feel better. I just had to let off steam some way."

Wors't you _ever_ grow up?” “Hope not,” purred Billy cheerfully, dropping herself on to a low hassock at Aunt Hannah's feet. “But, my dear, you--you're engaged!” Billy bubbled into a chuckling laugh. “As if I didn't know that, when I've just written a dozen notes to announce it! And, oh, Aunt Hannah, such a time as I've had, telling what a dear Bertram is, and how I love, love, _love_ him, and what beautiful eyes he has, and _such_ a nose, and--” “Billy!” Aunt Hannah was sitting erect in pale horror."

That's only what I _wanted_ to write,” chuckled Billy. “What I really did write was as staid and proper as--here, let me show you,” she broke off, springing to her feet and running over to her desk. “There! this is about what I wrote to them all,” she finished, whipping a note out of one of the unsealed envelopes on the desk and spreading it open before Aunt Hannah's suspicious eyes. “Hm-m; that is very good--for you,” admitted the lady. “Well, I like that!--after all my stern self-control and self-sacrifice to keep out all those things I _wanted_ to write,” bridled Billy."

Billy laughed, and tossed the note back on the desk. “I'm writing to Belle Calderwell, now,” she announced musingly, dropping herself again on the hassock. “I suppose she'll tell Hugh.” “Poor boy! He'll be disappointed.” Billy sighed, but she uptilted her chin a little. “He ought not to be. I told him long, long ago, the very first time, that--that I couldn't.” “I know, dear; but--they don't always understand.” Aunt Hannah sighed in sympathy with the far-away Hugh Calderwell, as she looked down at the bright young face near her."

To paint, indeed! As if Bertram didn't love me--just _me!_--if he never saw another tube of paint!” “I think he does, my dear.” Again there was silence; then, from Billy's lips there came softly: “Just think; we've been engaged almost four weeks--and to-morrow it'll be announced. I'm so glad I didn't ever announce the other two!” “The other _two!_” cried Aunt Hannah."

You didn't know about Cyril.” “Oh, there didn't anybody know it, either not even Cyril himself,” dimpled Billy, mischievously. “I just engaged myself to him in imagination, you know, to see how I'd like it. I didn't like it. But it didn't last, anyhow, very long--just three weeks, I believe. Then I broke it off,” she finished, with unsmiling mouth, but dancing eyes. “Billy!” protested Aunt Hannah, feebly. “But I _am_ glad only the family knew about my engagement to Uncle William--oh, Aunt Hannah, you don't know how good it does seem to call him 'Uncle' again. It was always slipping out, anyhow, all the time we were engaged; and of course it was awful then.” “That only goes to prove, my dear, how entirely unsuitable it was, from the start.” A bright color flooded Billy's face."

A tender light came into Billy's eyes. “Dear Uncle William! What a jewel he was, all the way through! And he'd have marched straight to the altar, too, with never a flicker of an eyelid, I know--self-sacrificing martyr that he was!” “Martyr!” bristled Aunt Hannah, with extraordinary violence for her. “I'm thinking that term belonged somewhere else."

It--it rather annoys me in some ways. I thought the whole family understood that I wasn't living by myself any longer--that I was living with you. I'm sure I thought I wrote them that, long ago.

They live West. I haven't seen any of them for years. I know there are several children--and I suppose I've been told their names. I know there's a boy--the eldest, I think--who is quite a singer, and there's a girl who paints, I believe; but I don't seem to remember a 'Mary Jane.'” “Never mind!

Before the open fire in the living-room he found a pensive Billy awaiting him--a Billy who let herself be kissed, it is true, and who even kissed back, shyly, adorably; but a Billy who looked at him with wide, almost frightened eyes. “Why, darling, what's the matter?” he demanded, his own eyes growing wide and frightened."

And they'll bow and smile and say 'How lovely!' to our faces, and 'Did you ever?' to our backs. Oh, no, I'm not sorry, Bertram; but I am--afraid.” Billy sighed, and gazed with pensive eyes into the fire. Across Bertram's face swept surprise, consternation, and dismay.

Dear me!'” Bertram gave a relieved laugh. “Nonsense, sweetheart! I should think you were a picture I'd painted and hung on a wall.” “I shall feel as if I were--with all those friends of yours.

Shawls, certainly, did seem to be a necessity with Aunt Hannah, as she usually wore from one to three at the same time--which again caused Bertram to declare that he always counted Aunt Hannah's shawls when he wished to know what the thermometer was."

But I _have_ sneezed six times, so I think 'twould be safer not to go out in this east wind. You were going to stop for Mrs. Granger, anyway, weren't you? So you'll have her with you for the tea.” “Yes, dear, don't worry.

I think if I told her Cyril approved of short hair and near-sightedness she'd I cut off her golden locks and don spectacles on the spot.” Aunt Hannah laughed softly."

Once it was merely the back of her head showing the mass of waving hair with its high lights of burnished bronze. Again it was still the back of her head with below it the bare, slender neck and the scarf-draped shoulders. In this picture the curve of a half-turned cheek showed plainly, and in the background was visible a hand holding four playing cards, at which the pictured girl was evidently looking. Sometimes it was a merry Billy with dancing eyes; sometimes a demure Billy with long lashes caressing a flushed cheek."

Still, watching her a little later, he noticed her absorbed face and eager enthusiasm, her earnest pursuance of an elusive harmony, and he wondered: did she, or did she not sing that song with feeling a little while before? Arkwright had not settled this question to his own satisfaction when Aunt Hannah came in at half-past five, and he was conscious of a vague disappointment as he rose to greet her."

Those pitiful little worn crutches of hers were mahogany, I'm sure, Bertram, and they were silver mounted.” Bertram made a restless movement. “I know, dear; but if you had some one with you! It wouldn't do for Will, of course, nor me--under the circumstances. But there's Aunt Hannah--” He paused hopefully."

Miss Winthrop had prolonged her visit in Washington until after Christmas, but she had returned to Boston now--and with her she had brought a brand-new idea for her portrait; an idea that caused her to sweep aside with superb disdain all poses and costumes and sketches to date, and announce herself with disarming winsomeness as “all ready now to really begin!”Bertram Henshaw was vexed, but helpless.

It's going to be the best, the very best thing I've ever done--I think! by the sketches.” “I'm so glad!” exclaimed Billy. “I'm so glad!” The repetition was so vehement that it sounded almost as if she were trying to convince herself as well as Bertram of something that was not true."

She thought with mortification, too, that it _did_ look as if she were not the proper wife for an artist if she were going to feel like this--always. Very resolutely, then, Billy turned to her music. This was all the more easily done, for, not only did she have her usual concerts and the opera to enjoy, but she had become interested in an operetta her club was about to give; also she had taken up the new song again."

Meanwhile they had a very pretty, convenient home which was, according to Bertram, “electrified to within an inch of its life, and equipped with everything that was fireless, smokeless, dustless, and laborless.” In it Marie had a spotlessly white kitchen where she might make puddings to her heart's content."

On the eleventh day of February Mrs. Greggory and her daughter arrived at Hillside for a ten-days' visit.

Hence she was not to be banished. She even, in a taunting way, seemed sometimes to be justifying her presence, for she reminded him: “After all, what's the difference?"

And so he worked. Sometimes he let his work remain. Sometimes one hour saw only the erasing of what the hour before had wrought. Sometimes the elusive something in Marguerite Winthrop's face seemed right at the tip of his brush--on the canvas, even. He saw success then so plainly that for a moment it almost--but not quite--blotted out The Thing."

BILLY TAKES HER TURNIf for Billy those first twenty days of March did not carry quite the tragedy they contained for Bertram, they were, nevertheless, not really happy ones.

She missed, too, undeniably, Arkwright's cheery presence, and the charm and inspiration of his music.

Before she would quite surrender to this heart-sickening belief, however, she determined to ask Bertram himself. Falteringly, but resolutely, therefore, one day, she questioned him. “Bertram, once you hinted that the picture did not go right because you were troubled over something; and I've been wondering--was it about--me, in any way, that you were troubled?” Billy had her answer before the man spoke."

From Bertram's own self she had it now--that she had been the cause of his being troubled; so she could doubt no longer. The only part that was uncertain was the reason why he had been troubled. Whether his bond to her had become irksome because of his love for another, or because of his love for no girl--except to paint, Billy did not know. But that it was irksome she did not doubt now. Besides, as if she were going to slay his Art, stifle his Ambition, destroy his Inspiration, and be a nuisance generally just so that _she_ might be happy! Indeed, no!

Then he saw Aunt Hannah--Aunt Hannah with her bonnet askew, her neck-bow awry, one hand bare, and the other half covered with a glove wrong side out. Aunt Hannah's cheeks, too, were flushed, and her eyes starry, but with dismay and anger--the last because she did not like the way Pete had said Miss Billy's name. It was one matter for her to object to this thing Billy was doing--but quite another for Pete to do it."

I'll go right in and surprise him.” “_Billy!_” This time it was Aunt Hannah who gasped her name. Pete had recovered himself by now, but he did not even glance toward Aunt Hannah. His face was beaming, and his old eyes were shining. “Miss Billy, Miss Billy, you're an angel straight from heaven, you are--you are! Oh, I'm so glad you came! It'll be all right now--all right! He's in the den, Miss Billy.” Billy turned eagerly, but before she could take so much as one step toward the door at the end of the hall, Aunt Hannah's indignant voice arrested her."

Pete, go tell your master that _we_ are here, and ask if he will receive _us_.” Pete's lips twitched. The emphatic “we” and “us” were not lost on him. But his face was preternaturally grave when he spoke. “Mr. Bertram is up and dressed, ma'am. He's in the den. I'll speak to him.” Pete, once again the punctilious butler, stalked to the door of Bertram's den and threw it wide open. Opposite the door, on a low couch, lay Bertram, his head bandaged, and his right arm in a sling."

He looked very white, and his features were pitifully drawn with suffering. “Mr. Bertram,” began Pete--but he got no further. A flying figure brushed by him and fell on its knees by the couch, with a low cry. Bertram's eyes flew open. Across his face swept such a radiant look of unearthly joy that Pete sobbed audibly and fled to the kitchen. Dong Ling found him there a minute later polishing a silver teaspoon with a fringed napkin that had been spread over Bertram's tray. In the hall above Aunt Hannah was crying into William's gray linen duster that hung on the hall-rack--Aunt Hannah's handkerchief was on the floor back at Hillside."

There were just two people in their world--two people, and unutterable, incredible, overwhelming rapture and peace. Then, very gradually it dawned over them that there was, after all, something strange and unexplained in it all. “But, dearest, what does it mean--you here like this?” asked Bertram then. As if to make sure that she was “here, like this,” he drew her even closer--Bertram was so thankful that he did have one arm that was usable. Billy, on her knees by the couch, snuggled into the curve of the one arm with a contented little sigh."

A puzzled frown showed below the fantastic bandage about his head. “'As soon as,'” he quoted then scornfully. “Were you ever by any possible chance thinking I _didn't_ want you?” Billy's eyes widened a little. “Why, Bertram, dear, don't you see? When you were so troubled that the picture didn't go well, and I found out it was about me you were troubled--I--” “Well?” Bertram's voice was a little strained. “Why, of--of course,” stammered Billy, “I couldn't help thinking that maybe you had found out you _didn't_ want me.” “_Didn't want you!_” groaned Bertram, his tense muscles relaxing. “May I ask why?”"

Pete told us,” she broke off wildly, beginning to sob. “Pete told you that I didn't care for any girl, only to paint?” demanded Bertram, angry and mystified. “No, no,” sobbed Billy, “not that. It was all the others that told me that! Pete told Aunt Hannah about the accident, you know, and he said--he said--Oh, Bertram, I _can't_ say it! But that's one of the things that made me know I _could_ come now, you see, because I--I wouldn't hinder you, nor slay your Art, nor any other of those dreadful things if--if you couldn't ever--p-paint again,” finished Billy in an uncontrollable burst of grief."

As for my not painting again--you didn't understand Pete, dearie. That was what they were afraid of at first--that I'd lose my arm; but that danger is all past now. I'm loads better. Of course I'm going to paint again--and better than ever before--_now!_” Billy lifted her head. A look that was almost terror came to her eyes. She pulled herself half away from Bertram's encircling arm."

Oh, no, Bertram--never that!” she faltered, still regarding him with fearful eyes. “It's only--for _me_, you know. I _can't_ go back now, and not have you--after this!--even if I do hinder you, and--” “_Hinder me!_ What are you talking about, Billy?” Billy drew a quivering sigh. “Well, to begin with, Kate said--” “Good heavens! Is Kate in _this_, too?” Bertram's voice was savage now. “Well, she wrote a letter.” “I'll warrant she did! Great Scott, Billy! Don't you know Kate by this time?” “Y-yes, I said so, too."

Why, Bertram Henshaw, what do you mean?” A shamed red crept to the man's forehead. “Well, I suppose I might as well own up now as any time. I was scared blue, Billy, with jealousy of--Arkwright.” Billy laughed gayly--but she shifted her position and did not meet her lover's eyes. “Arkwright? Nonsense!” she cried. “Why, he's going to marry Alice Greggory. I know he is! I can see it as plain as day in her letters. He's there a lot.” “And you never did think for a minute, Billy, that you cared for him?” Bertram's gaze searched Billy's face a little fearfully."

(Billy was so glad Bertram had turned the question on _her_ love instead of Arkwright's!) “There has never really been any one but you.” “Thank God for that,” breathed Bertram, as he drew the bright head nearer and held it close. After a minute Billy stirred and sighed happily. “Aren't lovers the beat'em for imagining things?” she murmured. “They certainly are.” “You see--I wasn't in love with Mr. Arkwright.”"

Bertram kissed the finger and subsided. “Humph!” he commented. There was a long silence; then, a little breathlessly, Billy asked: “And you don't--after all, love me--just to paint?” “Well, what is that? Is that Kate, too?” demanded Bertram, grimly. “No--oh, she said it, all right, but, you see, _everybody_ said that to me, Bertram; and that's what made me so--so worried sometimes when you talked about the tilt of my chin, and all that.” “Well, by Jove!” breathed Bertram."

I don't _know_ as I can trust you out of my sight till _then!_ You'll read something, or hear something, or get a letter from Kate after breakfast to-morrow morning, that will set you 'saving me' again; and I don't want to be saved--that way. I'm going to marry you to-morrow. I'll get--” He stopped short, with a sudden frown. “Confound that law! I forgot. Great Scott, Billy, I'll have to trust you five days, after all! There's a new law about the license. We've _got_ to wait five days--and maybe more, counting in the notice, and all.” Billy laughed softly. “Five days, indeed, sir! I wonder if you think I can get ready to be married in five days.”"

And forthwith he began to tell her how much he did, indeed, need her. “Billy, my dear!” It was Aunt Hannah's plaintive voice at the doorway, a little later."

You mean it'll be before--October?” Aunt Hannah glanced from one to the other uncertainly.

Otherwise it wouldn't have been so long, and--” But Aunt Hannah was gone. With a low-breathed “Long! Oh, my grief and conscience--_William!_” she had fled through the hall door. “Well, it _is_ long,” maintained Bertram, with tender eyes, as he reached out his hand to say good-night."
