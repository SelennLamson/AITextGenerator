He had a sense of fascinated pain when he tried to define to himself what its limits would probably be. Vistas of unchecked, expanding conquest stretched away in every direction. He held at his mercy everything within sight. Indeed, it rested entirely with him to say whether there should be any such thing as mercy at all--and until he chose to utter the restraining word the rout of the vanquished would go on with multiplying terrors and ruin. He could crush and torture and despoil his enemies until he was tired. The responsibility of having to decide when he would stop grinding their faces might come to weigh upon him later on, but he would not give it room in his mind to-night."}, {"size": 730, "text": "A picture of these faces of his victims shaped itself out of the flames in the grate. They were moulded in a family likeness, these phantom visages: they were all Jewish, all malignant, all distorted with fright. They implored him with eyes in which panic asserted itself above rage and cunning. Only here and there did he recall a name with which to label one of these countenances; very few of them raised a memory of individual rancour. The faces were those of men he had seen, no doubt, but their persecution of him had been impersonal; his great revenge was equally so. As he looked, in truth, there was only one face--a composite mask of what he had done battle with, and overthrown, and would trample implacably under foot."}, {"size": 896, "text": "He stared with a conqueror's cold frown at it, and gave an abrupt laugh which started harsh echoes in the stillness of the Board Room. Then he shook off the reverie, and got to his feet. He shivered a little at the sudden touch of a chill. A bottle of brandy, surrounded by glasses, stood on the table where the two least-considered of his lieutenants, the dummy Directors, had left it. He poured a small quantity and sipped it. During the whole eventful day it had not occurred to him before to drink; the taste of the neat liquor seemed on the instant to calm and refresh his brain. With more deliberation, he took a cigar from the broad, floridly-decorated open box beside the bottle, lit it, and blew a long draught of smoke thoughtfully through his nostrils. Then he put his hands in his pockets, looked again into the fire, and sighed a wondering smile. God in heaven! it was actually true!"}, {"size": 784, "text": "This man of forty found himself fluttering with a novel exhilaration, which yet was not novel. Upon reflection, he perceived that he felt as if he were a boy again--a boy excited by pleasure. It surprised as much as it delighted him to experience this frank and direct joy of a child. He caught the inkling of an idea that perhaps his years were an illusion. He had latterly been thinking of himself as middle-aged; the grey hairs thickening at his temples had vaguely depressed him. Now all at once he saw that he was not old at all. The buoyancy of veritable youth bubbled in his veins. He began walking up and down the room, regarding new halcyon visions with a sparkling eye. He was no longer conscious of the hated foe beneath his feet; they trod instead elastic upon the clouds."}, {"size": 627, "text": "The sound of someone moving about in the hallway outside, and of trying a door near by, suddenly caught his attention. He stood still and listened with alertness for a surprised instant, then shrugged his shoulders and began moving again. It must be nearly seven o'clock; although the allotment work had kept the clerks later than usual that day, everybody connected with the offices had certainly gone home. He realized that his nerves had played him a trick in giving that alarmed momentary start--and smiled almost tenderly as he remembered how notable and even glorious a warrant those nerves had for their unsettled state."}, {"size": 643, "text": "They would be all right after a night's real rest. He would know how to sleep NOW, thank God! But yes--there was somebody outside--and this time knocking with assurance at the right door, the entrance to the outer office. After a second's consideration, he went into this unlighted outer office, and called out through the opaque glass an enquiry. The sound of his voice, as it analyzed itself in his own ears, seemed unduly peremptory. The answer which came back brought a flash of wonderment to his eyes. He hurriedly unlocked and opened the door. \u201cI saw the lights in what I made out to be the Board Room,\u201d said the newcomer, as he entered."}, {"size": 649, "text": "\u201cI assumed it must be you. Hope I don't interrupt anything.\u201d \u201cNothing could have given me greater pleasure, Lord Plowden,\u201d replied the other, leading the way back to the inner apartment. \u201cIn fact, I couldn't have asked anything better.\u201d The tone of his voice had a certain anxious note in it not quite in harmony with this declaration. He turned, under the drop-light overhanging the Board-table, and shook hands with his guest, as if to atone for this doubtful accent. \u201cI shake hands with you again,\u201d he said, speaking rapidly, \u201cbecause this afternoon it was what you may call formal; it didn't count. And--my God!--you're the man I owe it all to.\u201d"}, {"size": 721, "text": "\u201cOh, you mustn't go as far as that--even in the absence of witnesses,\u201d replied Lord Plowden, lightly. \u201cI'll take off my coat for a few minutes,\u201d he went on, very much at his ease. \u201cIt's hot in here. It's by the merest chance I happened to be detained in the City--and I saw your lights, and this afternoon we had no opportunity whatever for a quiet talk. No--I won't drink anything before dinner, but I'll light a cigar. I want to say to you, Thorpe,\u201d he concluded, as he seated himself \u201cthat I think what you've done is very wonderful. The Marquis thinks so too--but I shouldn't like to swear that he understands much about it.\u201d The implication that the speaker did understand remained in the air like a tangible object."}, {"size": 707, "text": "Thorpe took a chair, and the two men exchanged a silent, intent look. Their faces, dusky red on the side of the glow from the fire, pallid where the electric light fell slantwise upon them from above, had for a moment a mysterious something in common. Then the tension of the glance was relaxed--and on the instant no two men in London looked less alike. Lord Plowden was familiarly spoken of as a handsome man. Thorpe had even heard him called the handsomest man in England--though this seemed in all likelihood an exaggeration. But handsome he undoubtedly was--tall without suggesting the thought of height to the observer, erect yet graceful, powerfully built, while preserving the effect of slenderness."}, {"size": 641, "text": "His face in repose had the outline of the more youthful guardsman-type--regular, finely-cut, impassive to hardness. When he talked, or followed with interest the talk of others, it revealed almost an excess of animation. Then one noted the flashing subtlety of his glance, the swift facility of his smile and comprehending brows, and saw that it was not the guardsman face at all. His skin was fresh-hued, and there was a shade of warm brown in his small, well-ordered moustasche, but his hair, wavy and worn longer than the fashion, seemed black. There were perceptible veins of grey in it, though he had only entered his thirty-fifth year."}, {"size": 641, "text": "He was dressed habitually with the utmost possible care. The contrast between this personage and the older man confronting him was abrupt. Thorpe was also tall, but of a burly and slouching figure. His face, shrouded in a high-growing, dust-coloured beard, invited no attention. One seemed always to have known this face--thick-featured, immobile, undistinguished. Its accessories for the time being were even more than ordinarily unimpressive. Both hair and beard were ragged with neglect. His commonplace, dark clothes looked as if he had slept in them. The hands resting on his big knees were coarse in shape, and roughened, and ill-kept."}, {"size": 626, "text": "\u201cI couldn't have asked anything better than your dropping in,\u201d he repeated now, speaking with a drag, as of caution, on his words. \u201cWitnesses or no witnesses, I'm anxious to have you understand that I realize what I owe to you.\u201d \u201cI only wish it were a great deal more than it is,\u201d replied the other, with a frank smile. \u201cOh, it'll mount up to considerable, as it stands,\u201d said Thorpe. He could hear that there was a kind of reservation in his voice; the suspicion that his companion detected it embarrassed him. He found himself in the position of fencing with a man to whom all his feelings impelled him to be perfectly open."}, {"size": 757, "text": "He paused, and was awkwardly conscious of constraint in the silence which ensued. \u201cYou are very kind to put it in that way,\u201d said Lord Plowden, at last. He seemed also to be finding words for his thoughts with a certain difficulty. He turned his cigar round in his white fingers meditatively. \u201cI gather that your success has been complete--as complete as you yourself could have desired. I congratulate you with all my heart.\u201d \u201cNo--don't say my success--say our success,\u201d put in Thorpe. \u201cBut, my dear man,\u201d the other corrected him, \u201cmy interest, compared with yours, is hardly more than nominal. I'm a Director, of course, and I'm not displeased that my few shares should be worth something instead of nothing, but----\u201d Thorpe lifted one of his heavy hands."}, {"size": 629, "text": "\u201cThat isn't my view of the thing at all. To be frank, I was turning over in my mind, just awhile ago, before you came in, some way of arranging all that on a different footing. If you'll trust it to me, I think you'll find it's all right.\u201d Something in the form of this remark seemed to restore to Lord Plowden his accustomed fluency of speech. \u201cI came here to say precisely that thing,\u201d he began--\u201cthat I do trust it to you. We have never had any very definite talk on the subject--and pray don't think that I want to go into details now. I'd much rather not, in fact. But what I do want to say to you is this: I believe in you."}, {"size": 692, "text": "I feel sure that you are going to go far, as the saying is. Well, I want to tie myself to your star. Do you see what I mean? You are going to be a power in finance. You are going to be able to make and unmake men as you choose. I should be very much obliged indeed if you would make me.\u201d Thorpe regarded the handsome and titled man of fashion with what seemed to the other a lethargic gaze. In truth, his mind was toiling with strenuous activity to master, in all its bearings, the significance of what had been said. This habit of the abstracted and lack-lustre eye, the while he was hard at work thinking, was a fortuitous asset which he had never up to that time learned that he possessed."}, {"size": 629, "text": "Unconsciously, he dampened the spirits of his companion. \u201cDon't imagine I'm trying to force myself upon you,\u201d Lord Plowden said, growing cool in the face of this slow stare. \u201cI'm asking nothing at all. I had the impulse to come and say to you that you are a great man, and that you've done a great thing--and done it, moreover, in a very great way.\u201d \u201cYou know how it was done!\u201d The wondering exclamation forced itself from Thorpe's unready lips. He bent forward a little, and took a new visual hold, as it were, of his companion's countenance. Lord Plowden smiled. \u201cDid you think I was such a hopeless duffer, then?\u201d he rejoined."}, {"size": 634, "text": "For answer, Thorpe leant back in his chair, crossed his legs, and patted his knee contentedly. All at once his face had lightened; a genial speculation returned to his grey eyes. \u201cWell, I was in a curious position about you, you see,\u201d he began to explain. The relief with which he spoke was palpable. \u201cI could not for the life of me make up my mind whether to tell you about it or not. Let's see--this is Thursday; did I see you Tuesday? At any rate, the scheme didn't dawn on me myself until toward evening Tuesday. But yesterday, of course, I could have told you--and again this afternoon--but, as I say, I couldn't make up my mind."}, {"size": 630, "text": "Once I had it on the tip of my tongue--but somehow I didn't. And you--you never gave me a hint that you saw what was going on.\u201d Again Lord Plowden smiled. \u201cI voted with you,\u201d he put in softly. Thorpe laughed, and relit his cigar. \u201cWell, I couldn't have asked anything better than this,\u201d he declared once again. \u201cIt beats all the rest put together, to my mind.\u201d \u201cPerhaps I don't quite follow your meaning,\u201d commented the other tentatively. \u201cWhy man,\u201d Thorpe explained, hesitating a little in his choice of words, but speaking with evident fervour; \u201cI was more anxious about you--and the way you'd take it--than about anything else."}, {"size": 725, "text": "I give you my word I was. I couldn't tell at all how you'd feel about the thing. You might think that it was all right, and then again you might round on me--or no, I don't mean quite that--but you might say it wasn't good enough for you, and wash your hands of the whole affair. And I can't tell you what a relief it is to find that you--that you're satisfied. Now I can go ahead.\u201d \u201cAh, yes--ahead,\u201d said the younger man, thoughtfully. \u201cDo you mind telling me--you see I'm quite in the dark as to details--how much further ahead we are likely to go? I comprehend the general nature of our advance--but how far off is the goal you have in sight?\u201d \u201cGod knows!\u201d answered Thorpe, with a rising thrill of excitement in his voice."}, {"size": 755, "text": "\u201cI don't give it any limit. I don't see why we should stop at all. We've got them in such a position that--why, good heavens! we can squeeze them to death, crush them like quartz.\u201d He chuckled grimly at the suggestion of his simile. \u201cWe'll get more ounces to the ton out of our crushings than they ever heard of on the Rand, too.\u201d \u201cMight I ask,\u201d interposed the other, \u201cwho may 'they' be?\u201d Thorpe hesitated, and knitted his brows in the effort to remember names. \u201cOh, there are a lot of them,\u201d he said, vaguely. \u201cI think I told you of the way that Kaffir crowd pretended to think well of me, and let me believe they were going to take me up, and then, because I wouldn't give them everything--the very shirt off my back--turned and put their knife into me."}, {"size": 690, "text": "I don't know them apart, hardly--they've all got names like Rhine wines--but I know the gang as a whole, and if I don't lift the roof clean off their particular synagogue, then my name is mud.\u201d Lord Plowden smiled. \u201cI've always the greatest difficulty to remember that you are an Englishman--a Londoner born,\u201d he declared pleasantly. \u201cYou don't talk in the least like one. On shipboard I made sure you were an American--a very characteristic one, I thought--of some curious Western variety, you know. I never was more surprised in my life than when you told me, the other day, that you only left England a few years ago.\u201d \u201cOh, hardly a 'few years'; more like fifteen,\u201d Thorpe corrected him."}, {"size": 718, "text": "He studied his companion's face with slow deliberation. \u201cI'm going to say something that you mustn't take amiss,\u201d he remarked, after a little pause. \u201cIf you'd known that I was an Englishman, when we first met, there on the steamer, I kind o' suspect that you and I'd never have got much beyond a nodding acquaintance--and even that mostly on my side. I don't mean that I intended to conceal anything--that is, not specially--but I've often thought since that it was a mighty good thing I did. Now isn't that true--that if you had taken me for one of your own countrymen you'd have given me the cold shoulder?\u201d \u201cI dare say there's a good deal in what you say,\u201d the other admitted, gently enough, but without contrition."}, {"size": 778, "text": "\u201cThings naturally shape themselves that way, rather, you know. If they didn't, why then the whole position would become difficult. But you are an American, to all intents and purposes.\u201d \u201cOh, no--I never took any step towards getting naturalized,\u201d Thorpe protested. \u201cI always intended to come back here. Or no, I won't say that--because most of the time I was dog-poor--and this isn't the place for a poor man. But I always said to myself that if ever I pulled it off--if I ever found my self a rich man--THEN I'd come piking across the Atlantic as fast as triple-expansion engines would carry me.\u201d The young man smiled again, with a whimsical gleam in his eye. \u201cAnd you ARE a rich man, now,\u201d he observed, after a momentary pause. \u201cWe are both rich men,\u201d replied Thorpe, gravely."}, {"size": 676, "text": "He held up a dissuading hand, as the other would have spoken. \u201cThis is how it seems to me the thing figures itself out: It can't be said that your name on the Board, or the Marquis's either, was of much use so far as the public were concerned. To tell the truth, I saw some time ago that they wouldn't be. Titles on prospectuses are played out in London. I've rather a notion, indeed, that they're apt to do more harm than good--just at present, at least. But all that aside--you are the man who was civil to me at the start, when you knew nothing whatever about my scheme, and you are the man who was good to me later on, when I didn't know where to turn for a friendly word."}, {"size": 600, "text": "Very well; here I am! I've made my coup! And I'd be a sweep, wouldn't I? to forget to-day what I was so glad to remember a week ago. But you see, I don't forget! The capital of the Company is 500,000 pounds, all in pound shares. We offered the public only a fifth of them. The other four hundred thousand shares are mine as vendor--and I have ear-marked in my mind one hundred thousand of them to be yours.\u201d Lord Plowden's face paled at the significance of these words. \u201cIt is too much--you don't reflect what it is you are saying,\u201d he murmured confusedly. \u201cNot a bit of it,\u201d the other reassured him."}, {"size": 679, "text": "\u201cEverything that I've said goes.\u201d The peer, trembling a little, rose to his feet. \u201cIt is a preposterously big reward for the merest act of courtesy,\u201d he insisted. \u201cOf course it takes my breath away for joy--and yet I feel I oughtn't to be consenting to it at all. And it has its unpleasant side--it buries me under a mountain of obligation. I don't know what to do or what to say.\u201d \u201cWell, leave the saying and doing to me, then,\u201d replied Thorpe, with a gesture before which the other resumed his seat. \u201cJust a word more--and then I suppose we'd better be going. Look at it in this way. Your grandfather was Lord Chancellor of England, and your father was a General in the Crimea."}, {"size": 647, "text": "My grandfather kept a small second-hand book-shop, and my father followed him in the business. In one sense, that puts us ten thousand miles apart. But in another sense, we'll say that we like each other, and that there are ways in which we can be of immense use to each other, and that brings us close together. You need money--and here it is for you. I need--what shall I say?--a kind of friendly lead in the matter of establishing myself on the right footing, among the right people--and that's what you can do for me. Mind--I'd prefer to put it all in quite another way; I'd like to say it was all niceness on your part, all gratitude on mine."}, {"size": 602, "text": "But if you want to consider it on a business basis--why there you have it also--perfectly plain and clear.\u201d He got up as he finished, and Lord Plowden rose as well. The two men shook hands in silence. When the latter spoke, it was to say: \u201cDo you know how to open one of those soda-water bottles? I've tried, but I can never get the trick. I think I should like to have a drink--after this.\u201d When they had put down their glasses, and the younger man was getting into his great-coat, Thorpe bestowed the brandy and cigars within a cabinet at the corner of the room, and carefully turned a key upon them."}, {"size": 659, "text": "\u201cIf you're going West, let me give you a lift,\u201d said Lord Plowden, hat in hand. \u201cI can set you down wherever you like. Unfortunately I've to go out to dinner, and I must race, as it is, to get dressed.\u201d Thorpe shook his head. \u201cNo, go along,\u201d he bade him. \u201cI've some odds and ends of things to do on the way.\u201d \u201cThen when shall I see you?\u201d--began the other, and halted suddenly with a new thought in his glance. \u201cBut what are you doing Saturday?\u201d he asked, in a brisker tone. \u201cIt's a dies non here. Come down with me to-morrow evening, to my place in Kent. We will shoot on Saturday, and drive about on Sunday, if you like--and there we can talk at our leisure."}, {"size": 664, "text": "Yes, that is what you must do. I have a gun for you. Shall we say, then--Charing Cross at 9:55? Or better still, say 5:15, and we will dine at home.\u201d The elder man pondered his answer--frowning at the problem before him with visible anxiety. \u201cI'm afraid I'd better not come--it's very good of you all the same.\u201d \u201cNonsense,\u201d retorted the other. \u201cMy mother will be very glad indeed to see you. There is no one else there--unless, perhaps, my sister has some friend down. We shall make a purely family party.\u201d Thorpe hesitated for only a further second. \u201cAll right. Charing Cross, 5:15,\u201d he said then, with the grave brevity of one who announces a momentous decision."}, {"size": 822, "text": "He stood still, looking into the fire, for a few moments after his companion had gone. Then, going to a closet at the end of the room, he brought forth his coat and hat; something prompted him to hold them up, and scrutinize them under the bright light of the electric globe. He put them on, then, with a smile, half-scornful, half-amused, playing in his beard. The touch of a button precipitated darkness upon the Board Room. He made his way out, and downstairs to the street. It was a rainy, windy October night, sloppy underfoot, dripping overhead. At the corner before him, a cabman, motionless under his unshapely covered hat and glistening rubber cape, sat perched aloft on his seat, apparently asleep. Thorpe hailed him, with a peremptory tone, and gave the brusque order, \u201cStrand!\u201d as he clambered into the hansom."}, {"size": 635, "text": "\u201cLOUISA, the long and short of it is this,\u201d said Thorpe, half an hour later: \u201cyou never did believe in me, as a sister should do.\u201dHe was seated alone with this sister, in a small, low, rather dismally-appointed room, half-heartedly lighted by two flickering gasjets. They sat somewhat apart, confronting a fireplace, where only the laid materials for a fire disclosed themselves in the cold grate. Above the mantel hung an enlarged photograph of a scowling old man. Thorpe's gaze recurred automatically at brief intervals to this portrait--which somehow produced the effect upon him of responsibility for the cheerlessness of the room."}, {"size": 712, "text": "There were other pictures on the walls of which he was dimly conscious--small, faded, old prints about Dido and AEneas and Agamemnon, which seemed to be coming back to him out of the mists of his childhood. Vagrant impressions and associations of this childhood strayed with quaint inconsequence across the field of his preoccupied mind. The peculiar odour of the ancient book-shop on the floor below remained like snuff in his nostrils. Somewhere underneath, or in the wainscoting at the side, he could hear the assiduous gnawing of a rat. Was it the same rat, he wondered with a mental grin, that used to keep him awake nights, in one of the rooms next to this, with that same foolish noise, when he was a boy?"}, {"size": 660, "text": "\u201cI know you always say that,\u201d replied Louisa, impassively. She was years older than her brother, but, without a trace of artifice or intention, contrived to look the younger of the two. Her thick hair, drawn simply from her temples into a knot behind, was of that palest brown which assimilates grey. Her face, long, plain, masculine in contour and spirit, conveyed no message as to years. Long and spare of figure, she sat upright in her straight-backed chair, with her large, capable hands on her knees. \u201cI believed in you as much as you'd let me,\u201d she went on, indifferently, almost wearily. \u201cBut I don't see that it mattered to you whether I did or didn't."}, {"size": 760, "text": "You went your own way: you did what you wanted to do. What had I to do with it? I don't suppose I even knew what part of the world you were in more than once in two or three years. How should I know whether you were going to succeed, when I didn't even know what it was you were at? Certainly you hadn't succeeded here in London--but elsewhere you might or you might not--how could I tell? And moreover, I don't feel that I know you very well; you've grown into something very different from the boy Joel that left the shop--it must be twenty years ago. I can only know about you and your affairs what you tell me.\u201d \u201cBut my point is,\u201d pursued Thorpe, watching her face with a curiously intent glance, \u201cyou never said to yourself: 'I KNOW he's going to succeed."}, {"size": 614, "text": "I KNOW he'll be a rich man before he dies.'\u201d She shook her head dispassionately. Her manner expressed fatigued failure to comprehend why he was making so much of this purposeless point. \u201cNo--I don't remember ever having said that to myself,\u201d she admitted, listlessly. Then a comment upon his words occurred to her, and she spoke with more animation: \u201cYou don't seem to understand, Joel, that what was very important to you, didn't occupy me at all. You were always talking about getting rich; you kept the idea before you of sometime, at a stroke, finding yourself a millionaire. That's been the idea of your life."}, {"size": 639, "text": "But what do I know about all that? My work has been to keep a roof over my head--to keep the little business from disappearing altogether. It's been hard enough, I can tell you, these last few years, with the big jobbers cutting the hearts out of the small traders. I had the invalid husband to support for between three and four years--a dead weight on me every week--and then the children to look after, to clothe and educate.\u201d At the last word she hesitated suddenly, and looked at him. \u201cDon't think I'm ungrateful\u201d--she went on, with a troubled effort at a smile--\u201cbut I almost wish you'd never sent me that four hundred pounds at all."}, {"size": 740, "text": "What it means is that they've had two years at schools where now I shan't be able to keep them any longer. They'll be spoiled for my kind of life--and they won't have a fair chance for any other. I don't know what will become of them.\u201d The profound apprehension in the mother's voice did not dull the gleam in Thorpe's eyes. He even began a smile in the shadows of his unkempt moustache. \u201cBut when I sent that money, for example, two years ago, and over,\u201d he persisted, doggedly--\u201cand I told you there'd be more where that came from, and that I stood to pull off the great event--even then, now, you didn't believe in your innermost heart that I knew what I was talking about, did you?\u201d She frowned with impatience as she turned toward him."}, {"size": 691, "text": "\u201cFor heaven's sake, Joel,\u201d she said, sharply--\u201cyou become a bore with that stupid nonsense. I want to be patient with you--I do indeed sympathize with you in your misfortunes--you know that well enough--but you're very tiresome with that eternal harping on what I believed and what I didn't believe. Now, are you going to stop to supper or not?--because if you are I must send the maid out. And there's another thing--would it be of any help to you to bring your things here from the hotel? You can have Alfred's room as well as not--till Christmas, at least.\u201d \u201cSupposing I couldn't get my luggage out of the hotel till I'd settled my bill,\u201d suggested Thorpe tentatively, in a muffled voice."}, {"size": 803, "text": "The practical woman reflected for an instant. \u201cI was thinking,\u201d she confessed then, \u201cthat it might be cheaper to leave your things there, and buy what little you want--I don't imagine, from what I've seen, that your wardrobe is so very valuable--but no, I suppose the bill ought to be paid. Perhaps it can be managed; how much will it be?\u201d Thorpe musingly rose to his feet, and strolled over to her chair. With his thick hands on his sister's shoulders he stooped and kissed her on the forehead. \u201cYou believe in me now, anyway, eh, Lou?\u201d he said, as he straightened himself behind her. The unaccustomed caress--so different in character from the perfunctory salute with which he had greeted her on his arrival from foreign parts, six months before--brought a flush of pleased surprise to her plain face."}, {"size": 655, "text": "Then a kind of bewilderment crept into the abstracted gaze she was bending upon the fireless grate. Something extraordinary, unaccountable, was in the manner of her brother. She recalled that, in truth, he was more than half a stranger to her. How could she tell what wild, uncanny second nature had not grown up in him under those outlandish tropical skies? He had just told her that his ruin was absolute--overwhelming--yet there had been a covert smile in the recesses of his glance. Even now, she half felt, half heard, a chuckle from him, there as he stood behind her! The swift thought that disaster had shaken his brain loomed up and possessed her."}, {"size": 667, "text": "She flung herself out of the chair, and, wheeling, seized its back and drew it between them as she faced him. It was with a stare of frank dismay that she beheld him grinning at her. \u201cWhat\u201d--she began, stammering--\u201cWhat is the matter, Joel?\u201d He permitted himself the luxury of smiling blankly at her for a further moment. Then he tossed his head, and laughed abruptly. \u201cSit down, old girl,\u201d he adjured her. \u201cTry and hold yourself together, now--to hear some different kind of news. I've been playing it rather low down on you, for a fact. Instead of my being smashed, it's the other way about.\u201d She continued to confront him, with a nervous clasp upon the chair-back."}, {"size": 711, "text": "Her breathing troubled her as she regarded him, and tried to take in the meaning of his words. \u201cDo you mean--you've been lying to me about--about your Company?\u201d she asked, confusedly. \u201cNo--no--not at all,\u201d he replied, now all genial heartiness. \u201cNo--what I told you was gospel truth--but I was taking a rise out of you all the same.\u201d He seemed so unaffectedly pleased by his achievement in kindly duplicity that she forced an awkward smile to her lips. \u201cI don't understand in the least,\u201d she said, striving to remember what he had told her. \u201cWhat you said was that the public had entirely failed to come in--that there weren't enough applications for shares to pay flotation expenses--those were your own words."}, {"size": 611, "text": "Of course, I don't pretend to understand these City matters--but it IS the case, isn't it, that if people don't subscribe for the shares of a new company, then the company is a failure?\u201d \u201cYes, that may be said to be the case--as a general rule,\u201d he nodded at her, still beaming. \u201cWell, then--of course--I don't understand,\u201d she owned. \u201cI don't know as you'll understand it much more when I've explained it to you,\u201d he said, seating himself, and motioning her to the other chair. \u201cBut yes, of course you will. You're a business woman. You know what figures mean. And really the whole thing is as simple as A B C."}, {"size": 627, "text": "You remember that I told you----\u201d \u201cBut are you going to stop to supper? I must send Annie out before the shops close.\u201d \u201cSupper? No--I couldn't eat anything. I'm too worked up for that. I'll get something at the hotel before I go to bed, if I feel like it. But say!\u201d--the thought suddenly struck him--\u201cif you want to come out with me, I'll blow you off to the swaggerest dinner in London. What d'ye say?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI shall have some bread and cheese and beer at nine. That's my rule, you know. I don't like to break it. I'm always queer next day if I do. But now make haste and tell me--you're really not broken then?"}, {"size": 722, "text": "You have really come out well?\u201d For answer he rose, and drew himself to his full height, and spread his bulky shoulders backward.

Oh, God, how I shall break them!\u201d He began pacing up and down on the narrow rug before the fender, excitedly telling his story to her. Sometimes he threw the words over his shoulder; again he held her absorbed gaze with his. He took his hands often from his pockets, to illustrate or enforce by gestures the meaning of his speech--and then she found it peculiarly difficult to realize that he was her brother."}, {"size": 687, "text": "Much of the narrative, rambling and disconnected, with which he prefaced this story of the day, was vaguely familiar to her. He sketched now for her in summary, and with the sonorous voice of one deeply impressed with the dramatic values of his declamation, the chronicle of his wanderings in strange lands--and these he had frequently told her about before. Soon she perceived, however, that he was stringing them together on a new thread. One after another, these experiences of his, as he related them, turned upon the obstacles and fatal pitfalls which treachery and malice had put in his path. He seemed, by his account, to have been a hundred times almost within touch of the goal."}, {"size": 745, "text": "In China, in the Dutch Indies, in those remoter parts of Australia which were a waterless waste when he knew them and might have owned them, and now were yielding fabulous millions to fellows who had tricked and swindled him--everywhere he had missed by just a hair's breadth the golden consummation. In the Western hemisphere the tale repeated itself. There had been times in the Argentine, in Brazil just before the Empire fell, in Colorado when the Silver boom was on, in British Columbia when the first rumours of rich ore were whispered about--many times when fortune seemed veritably within his grasp. But someone had always played him false. There was never a friendship for him which could withstand the temptation of profitable treason."}, {"size": 698, "text": "But he had hung dauntlessly on. He had seen one concession slipping through his fingers, only to strain and tighten them for a clutch at another. It did not surprise his hearer--nor indeed did it particularly attract her attention--that there was nowhere in this rapid and comprehensive narrative any allusion to industry of the wage-earning sort. Apparently, he had done no work at all, in the bread-winner's sense of the word. This was so like Joel that it was taken for granted in his sister's mind. All his voyages and adventures and painful enterprises had been informed by the desire of the buccaneer--the passion to reap where others had sown, or, at the worst, to get something for nothing."}, {"size": 646, "text": "The discursive story began to narrow and concentrate itself when at last it reached Mexico. The sister changed her position in her chair, and crossed her knees when Tehuantepec was mentioned. It was from that place that Joel had sent her the amazing remittance over two years ago. Curiously enough, though, it was at this point in his narrative that he now became vague as to details. There were concessions of rubber forests mentioned, and the barter of these for other concessions with money to boot, and varying phases of a chronic trouble about where the true boundary of Guatemala ran--but she failed clearly to understand much about it all."}, {"size": 663, "text": "His other schemes and mishaps she had followed readily enough. Somehow when they came to Mexico, however, she saw everything jumbled and distorted, as through a haze. Once or twice she interrupted him to ask questions, but he seemed to attach such slight importance to her comprehending these details that she forbore. Only one fact was it necessary to grasp about the Mexican episode, apparently. When he quitted Tehuantepec, to make his way straight to London, at the beginning of the year, he left behind him a rubber plantation which he desired to sell, and brought with him between six and seven thousand pounds, with which to pay the expenses of selling it."}, {"size": 720, "text": "How he had obtained either the plantation or the money did not seem to have made itself understood. No doubt, as his manner indicated when she ventured her enquiries, it was quite irrelevant to the narrative. In Mexico, his experience had been unique, apparently, in that no villain had appeared on the scene to frustrate his plans. He at least mentioned no one who had wronged him there. When he came to London, however, there were villains and to spare. He moved to the mantel, when he arrived at this stage of the story, and made clear a space for his elbow to rest among the little trinkets and photographs with which it was burdened. He stood still thereafter, looking down at her; his voice took on a harsher note."}, {"size": 750, "text": "Much of this story, also, she knew by heart. This strange, bearded, greyish-haired brother of hers had come very often during the past half-year to the little book-shop, and the widow's home above it, his misshapen handbag full of papers, his heart full of rage, hope, grief, ambition, disgust, confidence--everything but despair. It was true, it had never been quite real to her. He was right in his suggestion that she had never wholly believed in him. She had not been able to take altogether seriously this clumsy, careworn, shabbily-dressed man who talked about millions. It was true that he had sent her four hundred pounds for the education of her son and daughter; it was equally true that he had brought with him to London a sum which any of"}, {"size": 885, "text": "his ancestors, so far as she knew about them, would have deemed a fortune, and which he treated as merely so much oil, with which to lubricate the machinery of his great enterprise. She had heard, at various times, the embittered details of the disappearance of this money, little by little. Nearly a quarter of it, all told, had been appropriated by a sleek old braggart of a company-promoter, who had cozened Joel into the belief that London could be best approached through him. When at last this wretch was kicked downstairs, the effect had been only to make room for a fresh lot of bloodsuckers. There were so-called advertising agents, so-called journalists, so-called \u201cmen of influence in the City,\u201d--a swarm of relentless and voracious harpies, who dragged from him in blackmail nearly the half of what he had left, before he summoned the courage and decision to shut them out."}, {"size": 633, "text": "Worse still, in some ways, were the men into whose hands he stumbled next--a group of City men concerned in the South African market, who impressed him very favourably at the outset. He got to know them by accident, and at the time when he began to comprehend the necessity of securing influential support for his scheme. Everything that he heard and could learn about them testified to the strength of their position in the City. Because they displayed a certain amiability of manner toward him and his project, he allowed himself to make sure of their support. It grew to be a certainty in his mind that they would see him through."}, {"size": 850, "text": "He spent a good deal of money in dinners and suppers in their honour, after they had let him understand that this form of propitiation was not unpleasant to them. They chaffed him about some newspaper paragraphs, in which he was described as the \u201cRubber King,\u201d with an affable assumption of amusement, under which he believed that he detected a genuine respect for his abilities. Finally, when he had danced attendance upon them for the better part of two months, he laid before them, at the coffee-and-cigars stage of a dinner in a private room of the Savoy, the details of his proposition. They were to form a Syndicate to take over his property, and place it upon the market; in consideration of their finding the ready money for this exploitation, they were to have for themselves two-fifths of the shares in the Company ultimately to be floated."}, {"size": 631, "text": "They listened to these details, and to his enthusiastic remarks about the project itself, with rather perfunctory patience, but committed themselves that evening to nothing definite. It took him nearly a week thereafter to get an answer from any of them. Then he learned that, if they took the matter up at all, it would be upon the basis of the Syndicate receiving nine-tenths of the shares. He conceived the idea, after he had mastered his original amazement, that they named these preposterous terms merely because they expected to be beaten down, and he summoned all his good nature and tact for the task of haggling with them."}, {"size": 616, "text": "He misunderstood their first show of impatience at this, and persevered in the face of their tacit rebuffs. Then, one day, a couple of them treated him with overt rudeness, and he, astonished out of his caution, replied to them in kind. Suddenly, he could hardly tell why or how, they were all enemies of his. They closed their office doors to him; even their clerks treated him with contemptuous incivility. This blow to his pride enraged and humiliated him, curiously enough, as no other misadventure of his life had done. Louisa remembered vividly the description he had given to her, at the time, of this affair."}, {"size": 676, "text": "She had hardly understood why it should disturb him so profoundly: to her mind, these men had done nothing so monstrous after all. But to him, their offense swallowed up all the other indignities suffered during the years of his Ishmaelitish wanderings. A sombre lust for vengeance upon them took root in his very soul. He hated nobody else as he hated them. How often she had heard him swear, in solemn vibrating tones, that to the day of his death his most sacred ambition should be their punishment, their abasement in the dust and mire! And now, all at once, as she looked up at him, where he leant against the mantel, these vagabond memories of hers took point and shape."}, {"size": 606, "text": "It was about these very men that he was talking. \u201cAnd think of it!\u201d he was saying, impressively. \u201cIt's magnificent enough for me to make this great hit--but I don't count it as anything at all by comparison with the fact that I make it at their expense. You remember the fellows I told you about?\u201d he asked abruptly, deferring to the confused look on her face. \u201cYes--you make it out of them,\u201d she repeated, in an uncertain voice. It occurred to her that she must have been almost asleep. \u201cBut did I miss anything? Have you been telling what it is that you have made?\u201d \u201cNo--that you shall have in good time."}, {"size": 732, "text": "You don't seem to realize it, Louisa. I can hardly realize it myself.

Yes--it takes the breath away, doesn't it? But best of all--a thousand times best of all--practically every dollar of it comes out of those Kaffir swine--the very men that tried to rob me, and that have been trying to ruin me ever since. I tell you what I wish, Louise--I wish to God there could only be time enough, and I'd take it all in half-sovereigns--two millions of them, or three millions--and just untwist every coin, one by one, out from among their heart-strings."}, {"size": 739, "text": "Oh--but it'll be all right as it is.

He looked down at the tall, black-clad figure, bent in stiff awkwardness over the smoking grate, and his eyes softened. Then he took fresh note of the room--the faded, threadbare carpet, the sparse old furniture that had seemed ugly to even his uninformed boyish taste, the dingy walls and begrimed low ceiling--all pathetic symbols of the bleak life to which she had been condemned."}, {"size": 600, "text": "\u201cFrightens you?\u201d he queried, with a kind of jovial tenderness, as she got to her feet; \u201cfrightens you, eh?

After a little, she seated herself again, drawing her chair closer to the hearth. \u201cIt's years since I've lit this fire before the first of November,\u201d she remarked, with the air of defending the action to herself. \u201cOh, we're celebrating,\u201d he said, rubbing his hands over the reluctant blaze. \u201cEverything goes, tonight!\u201d Her face, as she looked up at him, betrayed the bewilderment of her mind."}, {"size": 725, "text": "\u201cYou set out to tell me what it was all about,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cYou see I'm completely in the dark.

I seem to be somebody else--a comparative stranger, so to speak. I've got to get acquainted with myself, all over again.

I'm speaking now of the present Company--after I'd decided to be my own promoter, and have at least some kind of 'a look-in' for my money.

But he did! He listened to me, and I told him how I'd been robbed, and how the Syndicate would have cut my throat if I hadn't pulled away,--and he said, 'Why, yes, I'll go on your Board.' Then I told him more about it, and presently he said he'd get me another man of title--a sky-scraper of a title too--to be my Chairman. That's the Marquis of Chaldon, a tremendous diplomatic swell, you know, Ambassador at Vienna in his time, and Lord Lieutenant and all sorts of things, but willing to gather in his five hundred a year, all the same.\u201d \u201cDo you mean that YOU pay HIM five hundred pounds a year?\u201d asked the sister."}, {"size": 766, "text": "\u201cYes, I've got a live Markiss who works for me at ten quid a week, and a few extras.

And then there's General Kervick, awfully well-connected old chap, they say, but I guess he needs all he can get. He's started wearing his fur-coat already. Well, that's my Board.

Or first, there were other things to be done. I saw that a good broker's name counted for a lot on a prospectus. I picked out one that I'd heard was reasonable--it'd been a splendid name if I could have got it--but he calmly said his price was two thousand pounds, all cash down--and I came away. Finally I got a fellow who hadn't done much of anything yet, and so wasn't so stiff about his figure."}, {"size": 635, "text": "He agreed to take 500 pounds cash, and 2,000 in shares.

Well, then, he and I got a Solicitor--he took 200 pounds cash, but he had to have 2,000 shares--and the firm of Auditors--they were 100 pounds cash and 1,000 shares. Every company has to have these people pasted on to it, by law. Oh yes, and then you must have your Bankers. You don't pay them anything, though, thank God!

You've got no more idea of what the press means, Louisa, than you have of--of a coil of snakes thawing out hungry in the spring. Why, if one blackmailer came to me, I swear a hundred did.

But that was just what I couldn't do, you see, so finally he took 1,000 pounds down and 5,000 in shares--and as I say he's done it tolerably well.

Well, accordingly, my Broker goes on 'change Saturday morning, and has his jobber shout out that he'll buy 'Rubber Consols'--that's what our shares are called on the street--at an eighth premium; that is to say, he offered to buy for twenty-two-and-six what we were offering to the public for twenty shillings."}, {"size": 626, "text": "Of course, you see, the object of that was to create the impression that there was a regular God-almighty rush for our shares.

Besides, you got the sales noticed in the papers, and that might start up applications from the public. Well, the Broker bought 1,000 shares this way on Saturday. On Monday, when it might still be possible to change the luck, he bought 3,500 more, still at that premium of an eighth.

I tell you, I was just plumb busted."}, {"size": 736, "text": "\u201cThere came along in the gutter a sandwich-man. I'd seen the cuss before during the day, walking up and down near my offices.

It was the bill of a paper that I had refused to be bled by, and there it was in big letters: 'The Rubber Bubble Burst!' 'Thorpe's Audacity Punished!' Those were the words. I can see them with my eyes shut. I stood there, looking at the fellow, and I suppose there was something in the way I looked, for he stopped too. Of course, he didn't know me from Adam, but all the same, I'm damned if he didn't wink his eye at me--as if we two had a joke between us."}, {"size": 787, "text": "And at that I burst out laughing--I simply roared with laughter, like a boy at a pantomime--and I took that last half-crown out of my pocket, and I gave it to the sandwich-man.

Well, I went on down the street. The members of the Stock Exchange were coming out of 'the house,' and making up little groups on the pavement.

Sell five hundred at three-quarters! At three-quarters you have 'em! Rubber Consols! Sell a thou. at three-quarters!' \u201cThis thing went into my brain like a live coal.

The obvious proximity of the dramatic climax drew her forward in her chair, and brought a glow of expectation to her eyes. \u201cI got myself away from that crowd somehow--I think I was afraid if I stayed I'd strangle the one who was shouting on the steps--and I went toward my office.

I turned--and I happened to see my Broker--the Scotchman, Semple, you know--coming along toward me. Right at that minute, like a flash, something dawned on me. In less than a second, I saw the whole damned rotten outfit turned upside down, with me on top. I made a jump, and ran to meet Semple. \u201c'How many shares of ours have you bought?'

Some they paid fifteen shillings for, some they got at twelve-and-six and even ten. That doesn't matter; it's of no more importance than the coppers you give to crossing-sweepers.

That is the point--they can't get them for love nor money--they must pay me my own price for them, or be ruined men.

They were so tickled that they asked no questions The allotment went through like a greased pig. About 5,000 shares went to those who had actually applied for them, and 88,000 were solemnly given to the dummy applicants. Of course, there wasn't a whisper about these dummies.

They are really mine, you understand. So now there's nothing for us to do but to apply to the Stock Exchange for a special settlement date, and meanwhile lie quiet and watch the Jews stew in their own juice. Or fry in their own fat, eh? That's better.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d she commented slowly, \u201cyou say there are no shares to be bought--and yet as I understand it, there are those five thousand that were sent out to the people who really applied.\u201d \u201cBravo, Lou!\u201d he answered her jovially."}, {"size": 622, "text": "\u201cYou actually do understand the thing.

In the first place, you see, they're scattered about among small holders, country clergymen and old maids on an annuity and so on--all over the country. Even if these people were all traced, and hunted up, suppose it was worth the trouble and expense, they wouldn't sell. The bigger the price they were offered, the more mulish they would be about holding.

There would be over twenty thousand others to be accounted for. That would be quite enough for my purposes. Oh, I figured all that out very carefully. My own first notion was to have the dummies apply for the whole hundred thousand, and even a little over. Then, you see, we might have allotted everything to the dummies, and sent back the money and applications of the genuine ones. But that would have been rather hard to manage with the Board.

This getting to the station ahead of time was of a piece with what had been happening all day--merely one more token of the general upheaval in the routine of his life.From early morning he had been acutely conscious of the feeling that his old manners and usages and methods of thought--the thousand familiar things that made up the Thorpe he had been--were becoming strange to him."}, {"size": 624, "text": "They fitted him no longer; they began to fall away from him.

A sudden and irresistible impulse had led him to the barber-shop in his hotel at the outset; he could not wait till after breakfast to have his beard removed."}, {"size": 859, "text": "The result, when he beheld it in the mirror, had not been altogether reassuring. The over-long, thin, tawny moustasche which survived the razor assumed an undue prominence; the jaw and chin, revealed now for the first time in perhaps a dozen years, seemed of a sickly colour, and, in some inexplicable way, misshapen. Many times during the day, at his office, at the restaurant where he lunched, at various outfitters' shops which he had visited, he had pursued the task of getting reconciled to this novel visage in the looking-glass. The little mirrors in the hansom cabs had helped him most in this endeavour. Each returned to him an image so different from all the others--some cadaverous, some bloated, but each with a spontaneous distortion of its own--that it had become possible for him to strike an average tolerable to himself, and to believe in it."}, {"size": 791, "text": "His sister had recognized him upon the instant, when he entered the old book-shop to get the money promised overnight, but in the City his own clerks had not known him at first. There was in this an inspiring implication that he had not so much changed his appearance as revived his youth. The consciousness that he was in reality still a young man spread over his mind afresh, and this time he felt that it was effacing all earlier impressions. Why, when he thought of it, the delight he had had during the day in buying new shirts and handkerchiefs and embroidered braces, in looking over the various stocks of razors, toilet articles, studs and sleeve-links, and the like, and telling the gratified tradesmen to give him the best of everything--this delight had been distinctively boyish."}, {"size": 608, "text": "He doubted, indeed, if any mere youth could have risen to the heights of tender satisfaction from which he reflected upon the contents of his portmanteaus.

The suit he had on was right enough for ordinary purposes, and his evening-clothes were as good as new, but the thought of a costume for shooting harassed his mind.

At least it had seemed to him, in the morning, when he had packed it, to be secure in this salvation. Uneasy doubts on the subject had soon risen, however, and they had increased in volume and poignancy as his conceptions of a wardrobe expanded in the course of the day's investigations and purchases.

He would have liked to buy the tickets himself, and have everything in readiness on the arrival of his host. As it was, he could not even tell the porter how his luggage was to be labelled, and there was now less than two minutes!

Many men in silk hats crowded to and fro on the platform, and a number of them shook the handle of the locked door. There was an effect of curses in the sound of their remarks which came through the closed window. Mr. Thorpe could not quite restrain the impulse to grin at them. \u201cAh, that's where you mistake,\u201d said Plowden, contemplating the mouthful of smoke he slowly blew forth. \u201cMy dear man, you can't imagine anybody to whom it would mean more than it does to me--I hope none of those fellows have a key."}, {"size": 698, "text": "They're an awful bore on this train.

I had to leave the Army when I was twenty-three--the other fellows all had plenty of money to spend, and it was impossible for me to drag along with a title and an empty pocket. I daresay that I ought to have stuck to it, because it isn't nearly so bad now, but twelve years ago it was too cruel for any youngster who had any pride about him--and, of course, my father having made rather a name in the Army, that made it so much harder for me."}, {"size": 677, "text": "And after that, what was there? Of course, the bar and medicine and engineering and those things were out of the question, in those days at least. The Church?--that was more so still. I had a try at politics--but you need money there as much as anywhere else--money or big family connections. I voted in practically every division for four years, and I made the rottenest speeches you ever heard of at Primrose League meetings in small places, and after all that the best thing the whips could offer me was a billet in India at four hundred a year, and even that you took in depreciated rupees. When I tried to talk about something at home, they practically laughed in my face."}, {"size": 688, "text": "I had no leverage upon them whatever.

Plowden seemed not to perceive the connection. They had left London Bridge behind, and he put his feet up on the cushions, and leant back comfortably."}, {"size": 702, "text": "\u201cOf course there was the City,\u201d he went on, speaking diagonally across to his companion, between leisurely intervals of absorption in his cigar. \u201cThere have been some directors' fees, no doubt, and once or twice I've come very near to what promised to be a big thing--but I never quite pulled it off. Really, without capital what can one do?--I'm curious to know--did you bring much ready money with you to England?\u201d \u201cBetween six and seven thousand pounds.\u201d \u201cAnd if it's a fair question--how much of it have you got left?\u201d Thorpe had some momentary doubts as to whether this was a fair question, but he smothered them under the smile with which he felt impelled to answer the twinkle in Plowden's eyes."}, {"size": 791, "text": "\u201cOh, less than a hundred,\u201d he said, and laughed aloud. Plowden also laughed. \u201cBy George, that's fine!\u201d he cried. \u201cIt's splendid. There's drama in it. I felt it was like that, you know. Something told me it was your last cartridge that rang the bell. It was that that made me come to you as I did--and tell you that you were a great man, and that I wanted to enlist under you. Ah, that kind of courage is so rare! When a man has it, he can stand the world on its head.\u201d \u201cBut I was plumb scared, all the while, myself,\u201d Thorpe protested, genially. \u201cCourage? I could feel it running out of my boots.\u201d \u201cAh, yes, but that's the great thing,\u201d insisted the other. \u201cYou didn't look as if you were frightened. From all one could see, your nerve was sublime. And nothing else matters--it was sublime.\u201d"}, {"size": 686, "text": "\u201cCurious--that thing happened to me once before,\u201d commented Thorpe, with ruminating slowness. \u201cIt was out on the plains, years ago, and I was in pretty hard luck, and was making my way alone from Tucson north, and some cowboys held me up, and were going to make kindling wood of me, they being under the impression that I was a horse-thief they were looking after. There was five or six minutes there when my life wasn't worth a last year's bird's-nest--and I tell you, sir, I was the scaredest man that ever drew the breath of life. And then something happened to be said that put the matter right--they saw I was the wrong man--and then--why then they couldn't be polite enough to me."}, {"size": 850, "text": "They half emptied their flasks down my throat, and they rode with me all the way to the next town, and there they wanted to buy everything liquid in the place for me. But what I was speaking of--do you know, those fellows got a tremendous notion of my nerve. It wasn't so much that they told me so, but they told others about it. They really thought I was game to the core--when in reality, as I tell you, I was in the deadliest funk you ever heard of.\u201d \u201cThat's just it,\u201d said Plowden, \u201cthe part of you which was engaged in making mental notes of the occasion thought you were frightened; we will say that it was itself frightened. But the other part of you, the part that was transacting business, so to speak--that wasn't in the least alarmed. I fancy all born commanders are built like that. Did you ever see General Grant?\u201d Thorpe shook his head."}, {"size": 608, "text": "\u201cWhat reminded me of him--there is an account in his Memoirs of how he felt when he first was given a command, at the beginning of the Civil War. He was looking about for the enemy, who was known to be in the vicinity, and the nearer he got to where this enemy probably was, the more he got timid and unnerved, he says, until it seemed as if cowardice were getting complete mastery of him. And then suddenly it occurred to him that very likely the enemy was just as afraid of him as he was of the enemy, and that moment his bravery all returned to him. He went in and gave the other man a terrible thrashing."}, {"size": 639, "text": "It doesn't apply to your case, particularly--but I fancy that all really brave men have those inner convictions of weakness, even while they are behaving like lions. Those must have been extraordinarily interesting experiences of yours--on the plains. I wish I could have seen something of that part of America when I was there last year. Unfortunately, it didn't come my way.\u201d \u201cI thought I remembered your saying you'd been West.\u201d Plowden smiled. \u201cI'm afraid I did think it was West at the time. But since my return I've been warned that I mustn't call Chicago West. That was as far as I went. I had some business there, or thought I had."}, {"size": 603, "text": "When my father died, that was in 1884, we found among his papers a lot of bonds of some corporation purporting to be chartered by the State of Illinois. Our solicitors wrote several letters, but they could find out nothing about them, and there the matter rested. Finally, last year, when I decided to make the trip, I recollected these old bonds, and took them with me. I thought they might at least pay my expenses. But it wasn't the least good. Nobody knew anything about them. It seems they related to something that was burned up in the Great Fire--either that, or had disappeared before that time."}, {"size": 655, "text": "That fire seems to have operated like the Deluge--it cancelled everything that had happened previously. My unhappy father had a genius for that kind of investment. I shall have great pleasure in showing you tomorrow, a very picturesque and comprehensive collection of Confederate Bonds. Their face value is, as I remember it, eighty thousand dollars--that is, sixteen thousand pounds. I would entertain with joy an offer of sixteen shillings for the lot. My dear father bought them--I should not be surprised to learn that he bought them at a premium. If they ever touched a premium for a day, that is certainly the day that he would have hit upon to buy."}, {"size": 632, "text": "Oh, it was too rare! Too inspired! He left nearly a hundred thousand pounds' worth of paper--that is, on its face--upon which the solicitors realized, I think it was thirteen hundred pounds. It's hard to imagine how he got them--but there were actually bonds among them issued by Kossuth's Hungarian Republic in 1848. Well--now you can see the kind of inheritance I came into, and I have a brother and sister more or less to look after, too.\u201d Thorpe had been listening to these details with an almost exaggerated expression of sympathy upon his face. The voice in which he spoke now betrayed, however, a certain note of incredulity."}, {"size": 607, "text": "\u201cYes, I see that well enough,\u201d he remarked. \u201cBut what I don't perhaps quite understand--well, this is it. You have this place of yours in the country, and preserve game and so on--but of course I see what you mean. It's what you've been saying. What another man would think a comfortable living, is poverty to a man in your position.\u201d \u201cOh, the place,\u201d said Plowden. \u201cIt isn't mine at all. I could never have kept it up. It belongs to my mother. It was her father's place; it has been in their family for hundreds of years. Her father, I daresay you know, was the last Earl of Hever. The title died with him."}, {"size": 668, "text": "He left three daughters, who inherited his estates, and my mother, being the eldest, got the Kentish properties. Of course Hadlow House will come to me eventually, but it is hers during her lifetime. I may speak of it as my place, but that is merely a facon de parler; it isn't necessary to explain to everybody that it's my mother's. It's my home, and that's enough. It's a dear old place. I can't tell you how glad I am that you're going to see it.\u201d \u201cI'm very glad, too,\u201d said the other, with unaffected sincerity. \u201cAll the ambitions I have in the world,\u201d the nobleman went on, sitting upright now, and speaking with a confidential seriousness, \u201ccentre round Hadlow."}, {"size": 648, "text": "That is the part of me that I'm keen about. The Plowdens are things of yesterday. My grandfather, the Chancellor, began in a very small way, and was never anything more than a clever lawyer, with a loud voice and a hard heart, and a talent for money-making and politics. He got a peerage and he left a fortune. My father, for all he was a soldier, had a mild voice and a soft heart. He gave a certain military distinction to the peerage, but he played hell-and-tommy with the fortune. And then I come: I can't be either a Chancellor or a General, and I haven't a penny to bless myself with. You can't think of a more idiotic box for a man to be in."}, {"size": 624, "text": "But now--thanks to you--there comes this prospect of an immense change. If I have money at my back--at once everything is different with me. People will remember then promptly enough that I am a Hadlow, as well as a Plowden. I will make the party whips remember it, too. It won't be a Secretary's billet in India at four hundred a year that they'll offer me, but a Governorship at six thousand--that is, if I wish to leave England at all. And we'll see which set of whips are to have the honour of offering me anything. But all that is in the air. It's enough, for the moment, to realize that things have really come my way."}, {"size": 617, "text": "And about that--about the success of the affair--I suppose there can be no question whatever?\u201d \u201cNot the slightest,\u201d Thorpe assured him. \u201cRubber Consols can go up to any figure we choose to name.\u201d Lord Plowden proffered the cigar case again, and once more helped himself after he had given his companion a light. Then he threw himself back against the cushions, with a long sigh of content. \u201cI'm not going to say another word about myself,\u201d he announced, pleasantly. \u201cI've had more than my legitimate innings. You mustn't think that I forget for a moment the reverse of the medal. You're doing wonderful things for me."}, {"size": 672, "text": "I only wish it were clearer to me what the wonderful things are that I can do for you.\u201d \u201cOh, that'll be all right,\u201d said the other, rather vaguely. \u201cPerhaps it's a little early for you to have mapped out in your mind just what you want to do,\u201d Plowden reflected aloud. \u201cOf course it has come suddenly upon you--just as it has upon me. There are things in plenty that we've dreamed of doing, while the power to do them was a long way off. It doesn't at all follow that these are the things we shall proceed to do, when the power is actually in our hands. But have you any plans at all? Do you fancy going into Parliament, for example?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d answered Thorpe, meditatively."}, {"size": 623, "text": "\u201cI think I should like to go into Parliament. But that would be some way ahead. I guess I've got my plans worked out a trifle more than you think. They may not be very definite, as regards details, but their main direction I know well enough. I'm going to be an English country gentleman.\u201d Lord Plowden visibly winced a little at this announcement. He seemed annoyed at the consciousness that he had done so, turning abruptly first to stare out of the window, then shifting his position on the seat, and at last stealing an uneasy glance toward his companion. Apparently his tongue was at a loss for an appropriate comment."}, {"size": 646, "text": "Thorpe had lost none of these unwilling tokens of embarrassment. Plowden saw that at once, but it relieved even more than it surprised him to see also that Thorpe appeared not to mind. The older man, indeed, smiled in good-natured if somewhat ironical comprehension of the dumb-show. \u201cOh, that'll be all right, too,\u201d he said, with the evident intention of reassurance. \u201cI can do it right enough, so far as the big things are concerned. It'll be in the little things that I'll want some steering.\u201d \u201cI've already told you--you may command me to the utmost of my power,\u201d the other declared. Upon reflection, he was disposed to be ashamed of himself."}, {"size": 794, "text": "His nerves and facial muscles had been guilty of an unpardonable lapse into snobbishness--and toward a man, too, who had been capable of behaviour more distinguished in its courtesy and generosity than any he had encountered in all the \u201cupper circles\u201d put together. He recalled all at once, moreover, that Thorpe's \u201ch's\u201d were perfect--aud, for some occult reason, this completed his confusion. \u201cMy dear fellow\u201d--he began again, confronting with verbal awkwardness the other's quizzical smile--\u201cdon't think I doubt anything about you. I know well enough that you can do anything--be anything--you like.\u201d Thorpe laughed softly. \u201cI don't think you know, though, that I'm a public-school man,\u201d he said. Plowden lifted his brows in unfeigned surprise. \u201cNo--I didn't know that,\u201d he admitted, frankly."}, {"size": 672, "text": "\u201cYes, I'm a Paul's Pigeon,\u201d Thorpe went on, \u201cas they called them in my day. That's gone out now, I'm told, since they've moved to the big buildings in Hammersmith. I did very well at school, too; came out in the first fourteen. But my father wouldn't carry the thing any further. He insisted on my going into the shop when I left St. Paul's and learning the book-business. He had precisely the same kind of dynastic idea, you know, that you fellows have. His father and his grand-father had been booksellers, and he was going to hand on the tradition to me, and my son after me. That was his idea. And he thought that Paul's would help this--but that Oxford would kill it."}, {"size": 627, "text": "\u201cOf course, he was right there--but he was wrong in supposing there was a bookseller in me. I liked the books well enough, mind you--but damn the people that came to buy them, I couldn't stand it. You stood two hours watching to see that men didn't put volumes in their pockets, and at the end of that time you'd made a profit of ninepence. While you were doing up the parcel, some fellow walked off with a book worth eighteen-pence. It was too slow for me. I didn't hit it off with the old man, either. We didn't precisely quarrel, but I went off on my own hook. I hung about London for some years, trying this thing and that."}, {"size": 758, "text": "Once I started a book-shop of my own--but I did no good here. Finally I turned it up altogether, and went to Australia. That was in 1882. I've been in almost every quarter of the globe since; I've known what it was to be shipwrecked in a monsoon, and I've lain down in a desert not expecting to get up again, with my belt tightened to its last hole for hunger--but I can't remember that I ever wished myself back in my father's book-shop.\u201d Plowden's fine eyes sparkled his appreciation of the other's mood. He was silent for a moment, then lifted his head as if something had occurred to him. \u201cYou were speaking of the plan that you should succeed to your father's business--and your son after you--you're not married, are you?\u201d Thorpe slowly shook his head."}, {"size": 214, "text": "\u201cOur station is the next,\u201d said the younger man. \u201cIt's a drive of something under two miles. You'd better light another cigar.\u201d He added, as if upon a casual afterthought: \u201cWe can both of us think of marrying now.\u201d"}, {"size": 646, "text": "FOR the next two hours, Thorpe's thoughts were almost wholly occupied with various phases of the large subject of domestic service. He seemed suddenly to have been transported to some region populated exclusively by clean-shaven men in brown livery. One of these was holding a spirited horse outside the station, and when Lord Plowden had taken the reins, and Thorpe had gathered the rugs about his knees and feet, this menial silently associated himself with the young man who had accompanied them from town, on the back seat of the trap. With these people so close behind him, Thorpe felt that any intimate conversation was out of the question."}, {"size": 873, "text": "Indeed, talk of any sort was not invited; the big horse burst forth with high, sprawling strides upon a career through the twilight, once the main road was reached, which it taxed all Plowden's energies to regulate. He kept up a continual murmuring monologue to the animal--\u201cSo--so--quiet, my pet,--so--so--easy, my beauty---so--so\u201d--and his wrists and gloved hands were visibly under a tremendous tension of strain, as they held their own against the rigid arched neck and mouth of steel. Thorpe kept a grip on the side of the trap, and had only a modified pleasure in the drive. The road along which they sped seemed, in the gathering dusk, uncomfortably narrow, and he speculated a good deal as to how frightened the two mutes behind him must be. But silence was such a law of their life that, though he strained his ears, he could not so much as hear them sigh or gasp."}, {"size": 755, "text": "It seemed but a very few minutes before they turned off, with but the most fleeting diminution of pace, upon a private road, which speedily developed into an avenue of trees, quite dark and apparently narrower than ever. Down this they raced precipitately, and then, coming out all at once upon an open space, swung smartly round the crescent of a gravel road, and halted before what seemed to be the door of a greenhouse. Thorpe, as he stood up in the trap, got an uncertain, general idea of a low, pale-coloured mansion in the background, with lights showing behind curtains in several widely separated windows; what he had taken to be a conservatory revealed itself now to be a glass gallery, built along the front of the central portion of this house."}, {"size": 693, "text": "A profusion of hospitable lights--tall wax-candles in brackets among the vines against the trellised wall--gave to this outlying entrance what the stranger felt to be a delightful effect. Its smooth tiled floor, comfortably bestrewn with rugs, was on a level with the path outside. There were low easy-chairs here, and a little wicker table bearing books and a lady's work-basket. Further on, giant chrysanthemum blooms were massed beneath the clusters of pale plumbago-flowers on the trellis. Directly in front, across the dozen feet of this glazed vestibule, the broad doorway of the house proper stood open--with warm lights glowing richly upon dark woods in the luxurious obscurity within."}, {"size": 739, "text": "What Thorpe noted most of all, however, was the servants who seemed to swarm everywhere. The two who had alighted from the trap had contrived somehow mysteriously to multiply themselves in the darkness. All at once there were a number of young men--at the horse's head, at the back and sides of the trap, at the first doorway, and the second, and beyond--each presenting such a smooth-faced, pallid, brown-clad replica of all the others that Thorpe knew he should never be able to tell them apart. Lord Plowden paused for a moment under the candle-light to look at his watch. \u201cWe did it in a bit over eight minutes,\u201d he remarked, with obvious satisfaction. \u201cWith four people and heavy roads that's not so bad--not so bad. But come inside.\u201d"}, {"size": 685, "text": "They moved forward through the wide doorway into an apartment the like of which Thorpe had not seen before. It was a large, square room, with a big staircase at the end, which separated and went off to right and left, half-way up its visible course. Its floor was of inlaid woods, old and uneven from long use, and carpeted here and there by the skins of tigers and leopards. There were many other suggestions of the chase about the room: riding boots, whips, spurs, and some stands of archaic weapons caught the eye at various points; the heads of foxes and deer peeped out on the blackened panels of the walls, from among clusters of hooks crowded with coats, hats, and mackintoshes."}, {"size": 680, "text": "At the right, where a fire glowed and blazed under a huge open chimney-place, there were low chairs and divans drawn up to mark off a space for orderly domestic occupation. The irregularity of every thing outside--the great table in the centre of the hall strewn with an incongruous litter of caps, books, flasks, newspapers, gloves, tobacco-pouches; the shoes, slippers, and leggings scattered under the benches at the sides--all this self-renewing disorder of a careless household struck Thorpe with a profound surprise. It was like nothing so much as a Mexican ranch--and to find it in the ancestral home of an English nobleman, filled to overflowing with servants, amazed him."}, {"size": 674, "text": "The glances that he cast about him, however, were impassive enough. His mind was charged with the ceaseless responsibility of being astonished at nothing. A man took his hat, and helped him off with his coat. Another moved toward the staircase with his two bags. \u201cIf you will follow Pangbourn,\u201d said his host, indicating this second domestic, \u201che will look after you. You would like to go up and change now, wouldn't you? There's a fire in your room.\u201d Thus dismissed, he went up the stairs in the wake of his portmanteaus, taking the turning to the left, and then proceeding by a long, low passage, round more than one corner, to what he conceived to be a wing of the house."}, {"size": 665, "text": "The servant ushered him into a room--and, in despite of himself, he sighed with pleasure at the sight of it. The prettiest and most charming of rooms it seemed to him to be--spacious and quaintly rambling in shape, with a delicately-figured chintz repeating the dainty effects of the walls upon the curtains and carpet and bed-hangings and chair-covers, and with a bright fire in the grate throwing its warm, cozy glow over everything. He looked at the pictures on the walls, at the photographs and little ornaments on the writing desk, and the high posts and silken coverlet of the big bed, and, secure in the averted face of the servant, smiled richly to himself."}, {"size": 613, "text": "This servant, kneeling, had unstrapped and opened the new bags. Thorpe looked to see him quit the room, this task accomplished, and was conscious of something like dismay at the discovery that he intended to unpack them as well. Pangbourn began gravely to unwrap one paper parcel after another and to assort their contents in little heaps on the sofa beside him. He did it deftly, imperturbably, as if all the gentlemen he had ever seen carried their belongings in packages done up by tradesmen. Thorpe's impulse to bid him desist framed itself in words on the tip of his tongue--but he did not utter these words."}, {"size": 733, "text": "After circling idly, hands in pockets, about the man and the bags for a little time, he invented something which it seemed better for him to say. \u201cI don't know what you'll be able to make of those things,\u201d he remarked, casually. \u201cMy man has been buying them today--and I don't know what he mayn't have forgotten. My whole outfit of that sort of thing went astray or was stolen at some station or other--the first part of the week--I think it must have been Leeds.\u201d \u201cYes, sir,\u201d said Pangbourn, without emotion. \u201cThey're very careless, sir.\u201d He went on impassively, shaking out the black garments and spreading them on the bed, laying out a shirt and tie beside them, and arranging the razors, strop, and brushes on the dressing-table."}, {"size": 697, "text": "He seemed to foresee everything--for there was not an instant's hesitation in the clock-like assiduity of his movements, as he bestowed handkerchiefs, in one drawer, socks in another, hung pyjamas before the fire, and set the patent-leather pumps against the fender. Even the old Mexican shooting-suit seemed in no way to disconcert him. He drew forth its constituent elements as with a practised hand; when he had hung them up, sombrero and all, in the wardrobe against the wall, they had the trick of making that venerable oaken receptacle look as if it had been fashioned expressly for them. Thorpe's earlier uneasiness quite lost itself in his admiration for Pangbourn's resourceful dexterity."}, {"size": 675, "text": "The delighted thought that now he would be needing a man like this for himself crossed his mind. Conceivably he might even get this identical Pangbourn--treasure though he were. Money could command everything on this broad globe--and why not Pangbourn? He tentatively felt of the coins in his pocket, as it became apparent that the man's task was nearing completion--and then frowned at himself for forgetting that these things were always reserved for the end of a visit. \u201cWill you dress now, sir?\u201d asked Pangbourn. His soft, distinct enunciation conveyed the suggestion of centuries of training. \u201cEh?\u201d said Thorpe, finding himself for the moment behind the other's thought."}, {"size": 714, "text": "\u201cShall you require me any further, sir?\u201d the man reframed the question, deferentially. \u201cOh! Oh--no,\u201d replied Thorpe. \u201cNo--I'll get along all right.\u201d Left to himself, he began hurriedly the task of shaving and dressing. The candles on either side of the thick, bevelled swinging mirror presented a somewhat embarrassing contrast to the electric light he was used to--but upon second thought he preferred this restrained aristocratic glimmer. He had completed his toilet, and was standing at the bay-window, with his shoulder holding back the edge of the curtain, looking out upon the darkened lawn and wondering whether he ought to go downstairs or wait for someone to summon him, when he heard a knock at his door."}, {"size": 696, "text": "Before he could answer, the door opened, and he made out in the candle-and firelight that it was Lord Plowden who had come in. He stepped forward to meet his host who, clad now in evening-clothes, was smoking a cigarette. \u201cHave they looked after you all right?\u201d said Plowden, nonchalantly. \u201cHave a cigarette before we go down? Light it by the candle. They never will keep matches in a bedroom.\u201d He seated himself in an easy-chair before the fire, as he spoke, and stretched out his shining slippers toward the grate. \u201cI thought I'd tell you before we went down\u201d--he went on, as Thorpe, with an elbow on the mantel, looked down at his handsome head--\u201cmy sister has a couple of ladies visiting her."}, {"size": 683, "text": "One of them I think you know. Do you remember on shipboard a Miss Madden--an American, you know--very tall and fine, with bright red hair--rather remarkable hair it was?\u201d \u201cI remember the lady,\u201d said Thorpe, upon reflection, \u201cbut we didn't meet.\u201d He could not wholly divest his tone of the hint that in those days it by no means followed that because he saw ladies it was open to him to know them. Lord Plowden smiled a little. \u201cOh, you'll like her. She's great fun--if she's in the mood. My mother and sister--I had them call on her in London last spring--and they took a great fancy to her. She's got no end of money, you know--at least a million and a half--dollars, unfortunately."}, {"size": 699, "text": "Her parents were Irish--her father made his pile in the waggon business, I believe--but she's as American as if they'd crossed over in--what was it, the 'Sunflower'?--no, the 'Mayflower.' Marvelous country for assimilation, that America is! You remember what I told you--it's put such a mark on you that I should never have dreamt you were English.\u201d Thorpe observed his companion, through a blue haze of smoke, in silence. This insistence upon the un-English nature of the effect he produced was not altogether grateful to his ears. \u201cThe other one,\u201d continued Plowden, \u201cis Lady Cressage. You'll be interested in her--because a few years ago she was supposed to be the most beautiful woman in London."}, {"size": 602, "text": "She married a shocking bounder--he would have been Duke of Glastonbury, though, if he had lived--but he was drowned, and she was left poor as a church mouse. Oh! by the way!\u201d he started up, with a gleam of aroused interest on his face--\u201cit didn't in the least occur to me. Why, she's a daughter of our General Kervick. How did he get on the Board, by the way? Where did you pick him up?\u201d Thorpe bent his brows in puzzled lines. \u201cWhy, you introduced me to him yourself, didn't you?\u201d he asked, slowly. Plowden seemed unaffectedly surprised at the suggestion, as he turned it over in his mind. \u201cBy George!"}, {"size": 614, "text": "I think you're right,\u201d he said. \u201cI'd quite forgotten it. Of course I did. Let me see--oh yes, I reconstruct it readily enough now. Poor old chappie--he needs all he can get. He was bothering her about money--that was it, I remember now--but what an idiot I was to forget it. But what I was saying--there's no one else but my mother and sister, and my brother Balder. He's a youngster--twenty or thereabouts--and he purports to be reading for his exams for the Army. If they opened his head, though, I doubt if they'd find anything but cricket and football, unless it might be a bit of golf. Well--that's the party."}, {"size": 702, "text": "I thought you might like to have a notion of them in advance. If you've finished your cigarette\u201d--he threw his own into the grate, and rose as he spoke--\u201cwe may as well be moving along. By the way,\u201d he concluded, as they walked toward the door, \u201cI've an idea that we won't say anything, just at the moment, about our great coup. I should like to keep it as a little surprise--for my mother and sister, you know.\u201d Some two hours later, Thorpe found the leisure and the restored equanimity needful for a dispassionate survey of his surroundings. He had become temporarily detached from the group over by the fireplace in the big drawing-room and was for the first time that evening very much at his ease."}, {"size": 778, "text": "It was all much simpler, upon experiment, than he had feared. He stood now in a corner of the ornate apartment, whither he had wandered in examining the pictures on the walls, and contemplated with serenity the five people whom he had left behind him. He was conscious of the conviction that when he rejoined them, it would be on a new footing of assured equality. He knew now the exact measure of everything. The Hon. Balder Plowden--a tall, heavily-built youth, with enormous shoulders and thick, hard hands, and pale straw-coloured hair and brows and eyelashes--had amiably sauntered beside him, and was elucidating for his benefit now, in slow, halting undertones, some unfathomable mystery connected with the varying attitude of two distinct breeds of terriers toward rats."}, {"size": 621, "text": "Across the room, just within reach of the flickering ruddy firelight from the hearth, the American guest, Miss Madden, was seated at the piano, playing some low and rather doleful music. Thorpe bent his head, and assumed an air of attention, but in truth he listened to neither the Honourable Balder nor the piano. His thoughts were concentrated jealously upon his own position in this novel setting. He said to himself that it was all right. Old Lady Plowden had seemed to like him from the start. The genial, if somewhat abstracted, motherliness of her welcome had been, indeed, his sheet anchor throughout the evening."}, {"size": 675, "text": "She had not once failed to nod her head and smile and twinkle her little kind eyes through their spectacles at him, whenever by word or look he had addressed her. Nor did his original half-suspicion, that this was her manner to people in general, justify itself upon observation. She was civil, even excessively civil, to the other two guests, but these ladies did not get the same eager and intent smile that he could command. He reasoned it out that Plowden must have said something pleasant to his mother about him--perhaps even to the point of explaining that he was to be the architect of their fortunes--but he did not like to ascribe all her hospitable warmth to that."}, {"size": 605, "text": "It was dear to him to believe that she liked him on his own merits--and he did believe it, as his softened glance rested upon her where she sat almost facing him in her padded, wicker chair--small, white-haired, rosy-cheeked, her intelligent face radiating a kind of alert placidity which somehow made him feel at home. He had not been as much at home with the others. The Honourable Balder, of course, didn't count; nobody paid attention to him, and least of all a busy Rubber King. He gave not much more heed to the American--the tall young woman with the red hair and the million and a half of dollars."}, {"size": 677, "text": "She was plainly a visitor like himself, not at all identified with the inner life of the household. He fancied, moreover, that she in no way desired to be thus identified. She seemed to carry herself with a deliberate aloofness underlying her surface amiability. Then he had spoken his few words with her, once or twice, he had got this effect of stony reserve close beneath her smile and smooth words. True, this might mean only that she felt herself out of her element, just as he did--but to him, really it did not matter what she felt. A year ago--why, yes, even a fortnight ago--the golden rumour of millions would have shone round her auburn hair in his eyes like a halo."}, {"size": 624, "text": "But all that was changed. Calculated in a solidified currency, her reported fortune shrank to a mere three hundred thousand pounds. It was a respectable sum for a woman to have, no doubt, but it did nothing to quicken the cool indifference with which he considered her. The two other young women were different. They were seated together on a sofa, so placed as regarded his point of view, that he saw only in part the shadowed profiles of the faces they turned toward the piano. Although it was not visible to him, the posture of their shoulders told him that they were listening to the music each holding the other's hand."}, {"size": 660, "text": "This tacit embrace was typical in his mind of the way they hung together, these two young women. It had been forced upon his perceptions all the evening, that this fair-haired, beautiful, rather stately Lady Cressage, and the small, swarthy, round-shouldered daughter of the house, peering through her pince-nez from under unduly thick black brows, formed a party of their own. Their politeness toward him had been as identical in all its little shades of distance and reservation as if they had been governed from a single brain-centre. It would be unfair to them to assume from their manner that they disliked him, or were even unfavourably impressed by him."}, {"size": 676, "text": "The finesse of that manner was far too delicate a thing to call into use such rough characterizations. It was rather their action as a unit which piqued his interest. He thought he could see that they united upon a common demeanour toward the American girl, although of course they knew her much better than they knew him. It was not even clear to him that there were not traces of this combination in their tone toward Plowden and the Honourable Balder. The bond between them had twisted in it strands of social exclusiveness, and strands of sex sympathy. He did not analyze all this with much closeness in his thoughts, but the impressions of it were distinct enough to him."}, {"size": 694, "text": "He rather enjoyed these impressions than otherwise. Women had not often interested him consecutively to any large degree, either in detail or as a whole. He had formulated, among other loose general notions of them, however, the idea that their failure to stand by one another was one of their gravest weaknesses. This proposition rose suddenly now in his mind, and claimed his attention. It became apparent to him, all at once, that his opinions about women would be henceforth invested with a new importance. He had scarcely before in his life worn evening dress in a domestic circle which included ladies--certainly never in the presence of such certificated and hall-marked ladies as these."}, {"size": 788, "text": "His future, however, was to be filled with experiences of this nature. Already, after this briefest of ventures into the new life, he found fresh conceptions of the great subject springing up in his thoughts. In this matter of women sticking together, for example--here before his eyes was one of the prettiest instances of it imaginable. As he looked again at the two figures on the sofa, so markedly unlike in outward aspect, yet knit to each other in such a sisterly bond, he found the spectacle really touching. Lady Cressage had inclined her classic profile even more toward the piano. Thorpe was not stirred at all by the music, but the spirit of it as it was reflected upon this beautiful facial outline--sensitive, high-spirited, somewhat sad withal--appealed to something in him."}, {"size": 748, "text": "He moved forward cautiously, noiselessly, a dozen restricted paces, and halted again at the corner of a table. It was a relief that the Honourable Balder, though he followed along, respected now his obvious wish for silence. But neither Balder nor anyone else could guess that the music said less than nothing to his ears--that it was the face that had beckoned him to advance. Covertly, with momentary assurances that no one observed him, he studied this face and mused upon it. The white candle-light on the shining wall beyond threw everything into a soft, uniform shadow, this side of the thread of dark tracery which outlined forehead and nose and lips and chin. It seemed to him that the eyes were closed, as in reverie; he could not be sure."}, {"size": 703, "text": "So she would have been a Duchess if her husband had lived! He said to himself that he had never seen before, or imagined, a face which belonged so indubitably beneath a tiara of strawberry leaves in diamonds. The pride and grace and composure, yes, and melancholy, of the great lady--they were all there in their supreme expression. And yet--why, she was no great lady at all. She was the daughter of his old General Kervick--the necessitous and haughtily-humble old military gentleman, with the grey moustache and the premature fur coat, who did what he was told on the Board without a question, for a pitiful three hundred a year. Yes--she was his daughter, and she also was poor. Plowden had said so."}, {"size": 850, "text": "Why had Plowden, by the way, been so keen about relieving her from her father's importunities? He must have had it very much at heart, to have invented the roundabout plan of getting the old gentleman a directorship. But no--there was nothing in that. Why, Plowden had even forgotten that it was he who suggested Kervick's name. It would have been his sister, of course, who was evidently such chums with Lady Cressage, who gave him the hint to help the General to something if he could. And when you came to think of it, these aristocrats and military men and so on, had no other notion of making money save by directorships. Clearly, that was the way of it. Plowden had remembered Kervick's name, when the chance arose to give the old boy a leg up, and then had clean forgotten the circumstance. The episode rather increased his liking for Plowden."}, {"size": 674, "text": "He glanced briefly, under the impulse of his thought, to where the peer sat, or rather sprawled, in a big low chair before the fire. He was so nearly recumbent in it, indeed, that there was nothing to be seen of him but an elbow, and two very trim legs extended to the brass fender. Thorpe's gaze reverted automatically to the face of General Kervick's daughter. He wondered if she knew about the Company, and about him, and about his ability to solidify to any extent her father's financial position. Even more, upon reflection, he wondered whether she was very fond of her father; would she be extremely grateful to one who should render him securely comfortable for life?"}, {"size": 858, "text": "Miss Madden rose from the piano before Thorpe noted that the music had ceased. There came from the others a soft but fervent chorus of exclamations, the sincerity and enthusiasm of which made him a little ashamed. He had evidently been deaf to something that deeply moved the rest. Even Balder made remarks which seemed to be regarded as apposite. \u201cWhat IS it?\u201d asked Lady Cressage, with obvious feeling. \u201cI don't know when anything has touched me so much.\u201d \u201cOld Danish songs that I picked up on the quai in Paris for a franc or two,\u201d replied Miss Madden. \u201cI arranged and harmonized them--and, oddly enough, the result is rather Keltic, don't you think?\u201d \u201cWe are all of us Kelts in our welcome to music--and musicians--like this,\u201d affirmed Lord Plowden, who had scrambled to his feet. With sudden resolution, Thorpe moved forward and joined the conversation."}, {"size": 692, "text": "THORPE'S life-long habit of early rising brought him downstairs next morning before anybody else in the house, apparently, was astir. At all events, he saw no one in either the hall or the glass vestibule, as he wandered about. Both doors were wide open, however, to the mild, damp morning air. He found on one of the racks a cap that was less uncomfortable than the others, and sauntered forth to look about him. His nerves were by no means in so serene a state as his reason told him they ought to be. The disquieting impression of bad dreams hung about him. The waking hour--always an evil time for him in these latter days of anxiety--had been this morning a peculiarly depressing affair."}, {"size": 898, "text": "It had seemed to him, in the first minutes of reviving consciousness, that he was a hopelessly ruined and discredited man; the illusion of disaster had been, indeed, so complete and vivid that, even now, more than an hour later, he had not shaken off its effects. He applied his mental energies, as he strolled along the gravel paths, to the task of reassuring himself. There were still elements of chance in the game, of course, but it was easy enough, here in the daylight, to demonstrate that they had been cut down to a minimum--that it was nonsense to borrow trouble about them. He reviewed the situation in painstaking detail, and at every point it was all right, or as nearly all right as any human business could be. He scolded himself sharply for this foolish susceptibility to the intimidation of nightmares. \u201cLook at Plowden!\u201d he bade his dolorous spirit. \u201cSee how easy he takes things.\u201d"}, {"size": 677, "text": "It was undeniable that Lord Plowden took things very easily indeed. He had talked with eloquence and feeling about the miseries and humiliations of a peerage inadequately endowed with money, but no traces of his sufferings were visible to Thorpe's observant eye. The nobleman himself looked the very image of contented prosperity--handsome, buoyant, light-hearted, and, withal, the best-groomed man in London. And this ancestral home of his--or of his mother's, since he seemed to insist upon the distinction--where were its signs of a stinted income? The place was overrun with servants. There was a horse which covered a distance of something like two miles in eight minutes."}, {"size": 715, "text": "Inside and out, Hadlow House suggested nothing but assured plenty. Yet its master told the most unvarying tales of poverty, and no doubt they were in one sense true. What he wished to fix his mind upon, and to draw strength for himself from, was the gay courage with which these Plowdens behaved as if they were rich. The grounds at the front of the house, hemmed in by high hedges and trees from what seemed to be a public road beyond, were fairly spacious, but the sleek decorum of their arrangement, while it pleased him, was scarcely interesting. He liked better to study the house itself, which in the daylight revealed itself as his ideal of what a historic English country-house of the minor class should be."}, {"size": 693, "text": "There had been a period in his youth when architecture had attracted him greatly as offering a congenial and lucrative career. Not much remained to him now of the classifications and phraseology which he had gone to the trouble of memorizing, in that far-off time, but he still looked at buildings with a kind of professional consciousness. Hadlow House said intelligible things to him, and he was pleased with himself for understanding them. It was not new in any part, apparently, but there was nothing pretentious in its antiquity. It had never been a castle, or a fortified residence. No violent alteration in habits or needs distinguished its present occupants from its original builders."}, {"size": 612, "text": "It had been planned and reared as a home for gentle people, at some not-too-remote date when it was already possible for gentle people to have homes, without fighting to defend them. One could fancy that its calm and infinitely comfortable history had never been ruffled from that day to this. He recalled having heard it mentioned the previous evening that the house stood upon the site of an old monastery. No doubt that accounted for its being built in a hollow, with the ground-floor on the absolute level of the earth outside. The monks had always chosen these low-lying sheltered spots for their cloisters."}, {"size": 651, "text": "Why should they have done so? he wondered--and then came to a sudden mental stop, absorbed in a somewhat surprised contemplation of a new version of himself. He was becoming literary, historical, bookish! His mind had begun to throw open again, to abstract thoughts and musings, its long-closed doors. He had read and dreamed so much as a lad, in the old book-shop! For many years that boyhood of eager concern in the printed page had seemed to him to belong to somebody else. Now, all at once, it came back to him as his own possession; he felt that he could take up books again where he had dropped them, perhaps even with the old rapt, intent zest."}, {"size": 611, "text": "Visions rose before him of the magnificent library he would gather for himself. And it should be in no wise for show--the gross ostentation of the unlettered parvenu--but a genuine library, which should minister to his own individual culture. The thought took instant hold upon his interest. By that road, his progress to the goal of gentility would be smooth and simple. He seemed not to have reasoned it out to himself in detail before, but now, at all events, he saw his way clearly enough. Why should he be tormented with doubts and misgivings about himself, as if he had come out of the gutter? Why indeed?"}, {"size": 729, "text": "He had passed through--and with credit, too--one of the great public schools of England. He had been there on a footing of perfect equality, so far as he saw, with the sons of aristocratic families or of great City potentates. And as to birth, he had behind him three generations at least of scholarly men, men who knew the contents, as well as the commercial value, of the books they handled. His grandfather had been a man of note in his calling. The tradition of Lord Althorp's confidence in him, and of how he requited it by securing Caxton's \u201cGolden Legend\u201d for the library of that distinguished collector, under the very nose of his hot rival, the Duke of Marlborough, was tenderly cherished as an heirloom in the old shop."}, {"size": 746, "text": "And Thorpe's father, too, though no such single achievement crowned his memory, had been the adviser and, as one might say, the friend of many notable writers and patrons of literature. The son of such forbears needed only money to be recognized by everybody as a gentleman. On his mother's side, now that he thought of it, there was something perhaps better still than a heritage of librarians' craft and tastes. His mother's maiden name was Stormont, and he remembered well enough the solemnity with which she had always alluded to the fact, in the course of domestic discussions. Who the Stormonts were he could not recall that he had ever learned, but his mother had been very clear indeed about their superiority to the usual ruck of people."}, {"size": 648, "text": "He would ask his sister whether she knew anything about them. In the meantime there was no denying that Stormont was a fine-sounding name. He reflected that it was his own middle name--and, on the instant, fancy engraved for him a card-plate on which appeared the legend--\u201cMr. Stormont Thorpe.\u201d It was an inspiration! \u201cJoel\u201d he had not used for so many years that now, after six months' familiarity with it on his sister's lips, he could not get accustomed to it. The colourless and non-committal style of \u201cJ. S. Thorpe,\u201d under which he had lived so long, had been well enough for the term of his exile--the weary time of obscure toil and suspense."}, {"size": 621, "text": "But now, in this sunburst of smiling fortune, when he had achieved the right to a name of distinction--here it was ready to his hand. A fleeting question as to whether he should carry the \u201cJ\u201d along as an initial put itself to his mind. He decided vigorously against it. He had always had a prejudice against men who, in the transatlantic phrase, parted either their hair or their names in the middle. He had made his unheeding way past the house to the beginning of the avenue of trees, which he remembered from the previous evening's drive. To his right, an open space of roadway led off in the direction of the stables."}, {"size": 894, "text": "As he hesitated, in momentary doubt which course to take, the sound of hoofs in the avenue caught his ear, and he stood still. In a moment there came into view, round a curve in the leafy distance, two horses with riders, advancing at a brisk canter. Soon he perceived that the riders were ladies; they drew rein as they approached him, and then it was to be seen that they were the pair he had judged to be such close friends last night--Lady Cressage and the daughter of the house. They smiled and nodded down at him, as he lifted his cap and bowed. Their cheeks were glowing and their eyes sparkling with the exhilaration of their ride. Even the Hon. Winifred looked comely and distinguished in his eyes, under the charm of this heightened vivacity. She seemed to carry herself better in the saddle than she did out of it; the sweep of her habit below the stirrup lent dignity to her figure."}, {"size": 740, "text": "But her companion, whose big chestnut mount was pacing slowly toward the stepping-block--how should he bring within the compass of thought the impressions he had had of her as she passed? There seemed to have been no memory in his mind to prepare him for the beauty of the picture she had made. Slender, erect, exquisitely-tailored, she had gone by like some queen in a pageant, gracious yet unapproachable. He stared after her, mutely bewildered at the effect she produced upon him--until he saw that a groom had run from the stable-yard, and was helping the divinity to dismount. The angry thought that he might have done this himself rose within him--but there followed swiftly enough the answering conviction that he lacked the courage."}, {"size": 766, "text": "He did not even advance to proffer his services to the other young lady, while there was still time. The truth was, he admitted ruefully to himself, they unnerved him. He had talked freely enough to them, or rather to the company of which they made part, the previous evening. There had been an hour or more, indeed, before the party broke up, in which he had borne the lion's share of the talk--and they had appeared as frankly entertained as the others. In fact, when he recalled the circle of faces to which he had addressed his monologue of reminiscences--curious experiences and adventures in Java and the Argentine, in Brazil and the Antilles and Mexico and the far West--it was in the face of Lady Cressage that he seemed to discern the most genuine interest."}, {"size": 614, "text": "Why should she frighten him, then, by daylight? The whimsical theory that the wine at dinner had given him a spurious courage occurred to him. He shrugged his shoulders at it, and, with his hands in his pockets, turned toward the stables. The stable-yard is, from some points of view, the prettiest thing about Hadlow. There is a big, uneven, grass-grown space, in the centre of which, from a slight mound, springs an aged oak of tremendous girth and height. All around this enclosure are buildings of the same pale yellowish brick as the mansion itself, but quaintly differing one from another in design and size."}, {"size": 721, "text": "Stables, carriage-houses, kennels, a laundry, a brewery, and half a dozen structures the intention of which is now somewhat uncertain--some flat-topped, some gabled, others with turrets, or massive grouped chimneys, or overhanging timbered upper stories--form round this unkempt, shadowed green a sort of village, with a communal individuality of its own. A glance shows its feudal relation to, and dependence upon, the great house behind which it nestles; some of the back-kitchens and offices of this great house, indeed, straggle out till they meet and merge themselves into this quadrangle. None the less, it presents to the enquiring gaze a specific character, of as old a growth, one might think, as the oak itself."}, {"size": 678, "text": "Here servants have lived, it may be, since man first learned the trick of setting his foot on his brother's neck. Plainly enough, the monks' servants lived and worked here; half the buildings on the side nearest the house belong to their time, and one of them still bears a partially-defaced coat of arms that must have belonged to an Abbot. And when lay lord succeeded cleric, only the garb and vocabulary of servitude were altered in this square. Its population crossed themselves less, and worked much harder, but they remained in a world of their own, adjacent aud subject to the world of their masters, yet separated from it by oh! such countless and unthinkable distances."}, {"size": 603, "text": "Thorpe sauntered along the side of the stables. He counted three men and a boy who visibly belonged to this department. The dog-cart of the previous evening had been run out upon the brick-pavement which drained the stables, and glistened with expensive smartness now beneath the sponge of one of the hostlers. Under cover, he discerned two other carriages, and there seemed to be at least half a dozen horses. The men who, in the half gloom of the loose-boxes, were busy grooming these animals made a curious whistling noise as they worked. Everybody in the yard touched a forelock to him as he passed."}, {"size": 672, "text": "From this quaint, old-world enclosure he wandered at his leisure, through an open gate in the wall at the back, into the gardens behind the house. There was not much in the way of flowers to look at, but he moved about quite unconscious of any deprivation. A cluster of greenhouses, massed against the southern side of the mansion, attracted his listless fancy, and he walked toward what appeared to be an entrance to them. The door was locked, but he found another further on which opened to his hand. The air was very hot and moist inside, and the place was so filled with broad-leaved, umbrageous tropical plants that he had to stoop to make his way through to the end."}, {"size": 763, "text": "The next house had a more tolerable atmosphere, and contained some blossoms to which he gave momentary attention. In the third house, through the glass-door, he could see a man--evidently a gardener--lifting some pots to a shelf overhead. The thought occurred to him that by entering into conversation with this man, he might indirectly obtain a hint as to the usual breakfast-hour at Hadlow. It was now nearly ten o'clock, and he was getting very hungry. Would they not ring a bell, or sound a gong, or something? he wondered. Perhaps there had been some such summons, and he had not heard it. It might be the intelligent thing for him to return to the house, at all events, and sit in the hall where the servants could see him, in case the meal was in progress."}, {"size": 650, "text": "Looking idly through the glass at the gardener, meanwhile, it suddenly dawned upon him that the face and figure were familiar. He stared more intently at the man, casting about in his memory for a clue to his identity. It came to him that the person he had in mind was a fellow named Gafferson, who had kept an impoverished and down-at-the-heels sort of hotel and general store on the road from Belize to Boon Town, in British Honduras. Yes, it undoubtedly was Gafferson. What on earth was he doing here? Thorpe gave but brief consideration to this problem. It was of more immediate importance to recall the circumstances of his contact with the man."}, {"size": 613, "text": "He had made Gafferson's poor shanty of an hotel his headquarters for the better part of a month--the base of supplies from which he made numerous prospecting tours into the mountains of the interior. Had he paid his bill on leaving? Yes, there was no doubt about that. He could even recall a certain pity for the unbusiness-like scale of charges, and the lack of perception of opportunity, which characterized the bill in question. He remembered now his impression that Gafferson would never do any good. It would be interesting to know what kind of an impression he, in turn, had produced on his thriftless host."}, {"size": 680, "text": "At any rate, there was no good reason why he should not find out. He opened the door and went in. The gardener barely looked up from his occupation, and drew aside to let the newcomer pass with no sign of a gesture toward his cap. Thorpe halted, and tried to look at the pots on the staging as if he knew about such things. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asked, in the tentative tone of one who is in no need of information, but desires to be affable. \u201cDrying off the first lot of gloxinias,\u201d answered the other. \u201cSome people put 'em on their sides, but I like 'em upright, close to the glass. It stands to reason, if you think about it.\u201d \u201cWhy, certainly,\u201d said Thorpe, with conviction."}, {"size": 747, "text": "In his mind he contrasted the independence of Gafferson's manner with the practised servility of the stable-yard--and thought that he liked it--and then was not so sure. He perceived that there was no recognition of him. The gardener, as further desultory conversation about his work progressed, looked his interlocutor full in the face, but with a placid, sheep-like gaze which seemed to be entirely insensible to variations in the human species. \u201cHow did you ever get back here to England?\u201d Thorpe was emboldened to ask at last. In comment upon the other's stare of puzzled enquiry, he went on: \u201cYou're Gafferson, aren't you? I thought so. When I last saw you, you were running a sort of half-way house, t'other side of Belize. That was in '90.\u201d"}, {"size": 651, "text": "Gafferson--a thick-set, squat man of middle age, with a straggling reddish beard--turned upon him a tranquil but uninformed eye. \u201cI suppose you would have been stopping at Government House,\u201d he remarked. \u201cThat was in Sir Roger Goldsworthy's time. They used to come out often to see my flowers. And so you remembered my name. I suppose it was because of the Gaffersoniana hybrids. There was a good bit in the papers about them last spring.\u201d Thorpe nodded an assent which it seemed better not to put into words. \u201cWell, it beats all,\u201d he mused aloud. \u201cWhy, man, there's gold in those mountains! You had an inside track on prospecting, placed as you were."}, {"size": 753, "text": "And there's cocoa--and some day they'll coin money in rubber, too.

And you were on the spot, and knew all the lay of the land--and yet here you are back in England, getting so much a month for messing about in the mud.\u201d He saw swiftly that his reflections had carried him beyond his earlier limit, and with rapidity decided upon frankness. \u201cNo, I wasn't in the Governor's outfit at all. I was looking for gold then--with occasionally an eye on rubber. I stopped at your place. Don't you remember me? My name's Thorpe. I had a beard then.

Hell! You must remember that!\u201d \u201cThat would have been the Chavica pertusum,\u201d said Gafferson, thoughtfully. He seemed to rouse himself to an interest in the story itself with some difficulty. \u201cYes--I remember it,\u201d he admitted, finally. \u201cI shouldn't have known you though. I'm the worst in the world about remembering people."}, {"size": 778, "text": "It seems to be growing on me.

You'd rather be doing this, eh? than making your pile in logwood and mahogany out there, or floating a gold mine?\u201d Gafferson answered quite simply: \u201cI wasn't the kind to ever make a pile. I got led into going out there when I was a youngster, and there didn't seem to be any good in trying to get back, but I wasn't making more than a bare living when you were there, and after that I didn't even do that much."}, {"size": 601, "text": "It took me a good many years to find out what my real fancy was.

What you're born for is to grow flowers. You can't afford to do it here, because nobody'll pay you for it, but you gather up your seeds and roots and so on, and come along with me to Atlanta, Georgia, and I'll put fat on your bones.'"}, {"size": 622, "text": "\u201cThat's what he said to me, and I took him at his word, and I was with him two years, and then I thought I'd like to come to England, and since then I've worked my way up here, till now I take a Royal Horticultural medal regular, and there's a clematis with salmon-coloured bars that'll be in the market next spring that's named after my master. And what could I ask more 'n that?\u201d \u201cQuite right,\u201d said Thorpe. \u201cWhat time do they have breakfast here?\u201d The gardener's round, phlegmatic, florid countenance had taken on a mild glow of animation during his narrative.

All I want is something to eat.\u201d \u201cA guest,\u201d Gafferson repeated in turn, slowly.

I've taken a fancy to him, and I'm going to make a rich man of him. He was keen about my seeing his place here, and kept urging me to come, and so finally I've got away over Sunday to oblige him. By the way--I shall buy an estate in the country as soon as the right thing offers, and I shall want to set up no end of gardens and greenhouses and all that. I see that I couldn't come to a better man than you for advice. I daresay I'll put the whole arrangement of it in your hands.

He was conscious of annoyance with this moon-faced, dawdling Gafferson, who had been afforded such a splendid chance of profiting by an old acquaintanceship--it might even be called, as things went in Honduras, a friendship--and who had so clumsily failed to rise to the situation. The bitter thought of going back and giving him a half-crown rose in Thorpe's inventive mind, and he paused for an instant, his hand on the door-knob, to think it over. The gratuity would certainly put Gafferson in his place, but then the spirit in which it was offered would be wholly lost on his dull brain."}, {"size": 769, "text": "And moreover, was it so certain that he would take it? He had not said \u201csir\u201d once, and he had talked about medals with the pride of a scientist.

He quitted the greenhouse with resolution, and directed his steps toward the front of the mansion. As he entered the hall, a remarkably tuneful and resonant chime filled his ears with novel music. He looked and saw that a white-capped, neatly-clad domestic, standing with her back to him beside the newel-post of the stairs, was beating out the tune with two padded sticks upon some strips of metal ranged on a stand of Indian workmanship."}, {"size": 735, "text": "The sound was delightful, but even more so was the implication that it betokened breakfast.

For one thing, the ladies themselves had a morning manner, so to speak, which differed widely from the impressions he had had of their deportment the previous evening.

And all over England there are young gentlemen like that--the very pick of the hunting-fields, strong and brave as lions, fit to lead men anywhere, the very men England wants to have fighting her battles--and they can't get places in the Army because--what was it Balder came to grief over last time?--because they can't remember whether it's Ispahan or Teheran that's the capital of Persia."}, {"size": 654, "text": "\u201cThey are the fine old sort that would go and capture both places at the point of the bayonet--and find out their names afterward--but it seems that's not what the Army wants nowadays.

The ladies visibly dallied over their tea-cups to listen to him; the charm of having them all to himself, and of holding them in interested entertainment by his discourse--these ladies of supremely refined associations and position--seemed to provide an inspiration of its own."}, {"size": 658, "text": "He could hear that his voice was automatically modulating itself to their critical ears. His language was producing itself with as much delicacy of selection as if it came out of a book--and yet preserving the savour of quaint, outlandish idiom which his listeners clearly liked. Upon the instant when Lady Plowden's gathering of skirts, and glance across the table, warned him that they were to rise, he said deliberately to himself that this had been the most enjoyable episode of his whole life. There were cigar boxes on the fine old oak mantel, out in the hall, and Winnie indicated them to him with the obvious suggestion that he was expected to smoke."}, {"size": 722, "text": "He looked her over as he lit his cigar--where she stood spreading her hands above the blaze of the logs, and concluded that she was much nicer upon acquaintance than he had thought. Her slight figure might not be beautiful, but beyond doubt its lines were ladylike. The same extenuating word applied itself in his mind to her thin and swarthy, though distinguished, features. They bore the stamp of caste, and so did the way she looked at one through her eye-glasses, from under those over-heavy black eyebrows, holding her head a little to one side. Though it was easy enough to guess that she had a spirit of her own, her gentle, almost anxious, deference to her mother had shown that she had it under admirable control."}, {"size": 635, "text": "He had read about her in a peerage at his sister's book-shop the previous day. Unfortunately it did not give her age, but that was not so important, after all. She was styled Honourable. She was the daughter of one Viscount and the sister of another. Her grandfather had been an Earl, and the book had shown her to possess a bewildering number of relationships among titled folks. All this was very interesting to him--and somewhat suggestive. Vague, shapeless hints at projects rose in his brain as he looked at her. \u201cI'm afraid you think my brother has odd notions of entertaining his guests,\u201d she remarked to him, over her shoulder."}, {"size": 663, "text": "The other ladies had not joined them. \u201cOh, I'm all right,\u201d he protested cordially. \u201cI should hate to have him put himself out in the slightest.\u201d Upon consideration he added: \u201cI suppose he has given up the idea of shooting to-day.\u201d \u201cI think not,\u201d she answered.\u201d The keeper was about this morning, that is--and he doesn't often come unless they are to go out with the guns. I suppose you are very fond of shooting.\u201d \u201cWell--I've done some--in my time,\u201d Thorpe replied, cautiously. It did not seem necessary to explain that he had yet to fire his first gun on English soil. \u201cIt's a good many years,\u201d he went on, \u201csince I had the time and opportunity to do much at it."}, {"size": 705, "text": "I think the last shooting I did was alligators.

Balder's by way of being a crack-shot, you know. There are some pheasants, though. We saw them flying when we were out this morning.\u201d Thorpe wondered if it would be possible to consult her upon the question of apparel. Clearly, he ought to make some difference in his garb, yet the mental vision of him-self in those old Mexican clothes revealed itself now as ridiculously impossible."}, {"size": 641, "text": "He must have been out of his mind to have conceived anything so preposterous as rigging himself out, among these polished people, like a cow-puncher down on his luck. \u201cI wonder when your brother will expect to start,\u201d he began, uneasily. \u201cPerhaps I ought to go and get ready.\u201d \u201cAh, here comes his man,\u201d remarked the sister. A round-faced, smooth-mannered youngster--whom Thorpe discovered to be wearing cord-breeches and leather leggings as he descended the stairs--advanced toward him and prefaced his message by the invariable salutation. \u201cHis Lordship will be down, sir, in ten minutes--and he hopes you'll be ready, sir,\u201d the valet said."}, {"size": 663, "text": "\u201cSend Pangbourn to this gentleman's room,\u201d Miss Winnie bade him, and with a gesture of comprehensive submission he went away. The calm readiness with which she had provided a solution for his difficulties impressed Thorpe greatly. It would never have occurred to him that Pangbourn was the answer to the problem of his clothes, yet how obvious it had been to her. These old families did something more than fill their houses with servants; they mastered the art of making these servants an integral part of the machinery of existence. Fancy having a man to do all your thinking about clothes for you, and then dress you, into the bargain. Oh, it was all splendid."}, {"size": 628, "text": "\u201cIt seems that we're going shooting,\u201d Thorpe found himself explaining, a few moments later in his bedroom, to the attentive Pangbourn. He decided to throw himself with frankness upon the domestic's resourceful good-feeling. \u201cI haven't brought anything for shooting at all. Somehow I got the idea we were going to do rough riding instead--and so I fetched along some old Mexican riding-clothes that make me feel more at home in the saddle than anything else would. You know how fond a man gets of old, loose things like that. But about this shooting--I want you to fix me out. What do I need? Just some breeches and leggings, eh?"}, {"size": 668, "text": "You can manage them for me, can't you?\u201d Pangbourn could and did--and it was upon his advice that the Mexican jacket was utilized to complete the out-fit. Its shape was beyond doubt uncommon, but it had big pockets, and it looked like business. Thorpe, as he glanced up and down his image in the tall mirror of the wardrobe, felt that he must kill a large number of birds to justify the effect of pitiless proficiency which this jacket lent to his appearance. \u201cWe will find a cap below, sir,\u201d Pangbourn announced, with serenity, and Thorpe, who had been tentatively fingering the big, flaring sombrero, thrust it back upon its peg as if it had proved too hot to handle."}, {"size": 787, "text": "Downstairs in the hall there was more waiting to be done, and there was nobody now to bear him company. He lit another cigar, tried on various caps till he found a leathern one to suit him, and then dawdled about the room and the adjoining conservatory for what seemed to him more than half an hour. This phase of the aristocratic routine, he felt, did not commend itself so warmly to him as did some others. Everybody else, however, seemed to regard it as so wholly a matter of course that Plowden should do as he liked, that he forbore formulating a complaint even to himself. At last, this nobleman's valet descended the stairs once more. \u201cHis Lordship will be down very shortly now, sir,\u201d he declared--\u201cand will you be good enough to come into the gun-room, sir, and see the keeper?\u201d"}, {"size": 680, "text": "Thorpe followed him through a doorway under the staircase--the existence of which he had not suspected--into a bare-looking apartment fitted like a pantry with shelves. After the semi-gloom of the hall, it was almost glaringly lighted. The windows and another door opened, he saw, upon a court connected with the stable-yard. By this entrance, no doubt, had come the keeper, a small, brown-faced, brown-clothed man of mature years, with the strap of a pouch over his shoulder, who stood looking at the contents of the shelves. He mechanically saluted Thorpe in turn, and then resumed his occupation. There were numerous gun cases on the lower shelf, and many boxes and bags above."}, {"size": 671, "text": "\u201cDid his Lordship say what gun?\u201d the keeper demanded of the valet. He had a bright-eyed, intent glance, and his tone conveyed a sense of some broad, impersonal, out-of-doors disdain for liveried house-men. The valet, standing behind Thorpe, shrugged his shoulders and eloquently shook his head. \u201cDo you like an 'ammerless, sir?\u201d the keeper turned to Thorpe. To his intense humiliation, Thorpe could not make out the meaning of the query. \u201cOh, anything'll do for me,\u201d he said, awkwardly smiling. \u201cIt's years since I've shot--I daresay one gun'll be quite the same as another to me.\u201d He felt the knowing bright eyes of the keeper taking all his measurements as a sportsman."}, {"size": 665, "text": "\u201cYou'd do best with 'B,' sir, I fancy,\u201d the functionary decided at last, and his way of saying it gave Thorpe the notion that \u201cB\u201d must be the weapon that was reserved for school-boys. He watched the operation of putting the gun together, and then took it, and laid it over his arm, and followed the valet out into the hall again, in dignified silence. To the keeper's remark--\u201cMr. Balder has its mate with him today, sir,\u201d he gave only a restrained nod. There were even now whole minutes to wait before Lord Plowden appeared. He came down the stairs then with the brisk, rather impatient air of a busy man whose plans are embarrassed by the unpunctuality of others."}, {"size": 655, "text": "He was fully attired, hob-nailed shoes, leggings, leather coat and cap, gloves, scarf round his throat and all--and he behaved as if there was not a minute to lose.

They walked together for half a mile, it is true, along a rural bye-road first and then across some fields, but the party was close at their heels, and Plowden walked so fast that conversation of any sort, save an occasional remark about the birds and the covers between him and the keeper, was impracticable. The Hon. Balder suddenly turned up in the landscape, leaning against a gate set in a hedgerow, and their course was deflected toward him, but even when they came up to him, the expedition seemed to gain nothing of a social character. The few curt words that were exchanged, as they halted here to distribute cartridges and hold brief consultation, bore exclusively upon the subject in hand."}, {"size": 710, "text": "The keeper assumed now an authority which Thorpe, breathing heavily over the unwonted exercise and hoping for nothing so much as that they would henceforth take things easy, thought intolerable. He was amazed that the two brothers should take without cavil the arbitrary orders of this elderly peasant. He bade Lord Plowden proceed to a certain point in one direction, and that nobleman, followed by his valet with the gun and the stool, set meekly off without a word. Balder, with equal docility, vaulted the gate, and moved away down the lane at the bidding of the keeper. Neither of them had intervened to mitigate the destiny of their guest, or displayed any interest as to what was going to become of him."}, {"size": 752, "text": "Thorpe said to himself that he did not like this--and though afterward, when he had also climbed the gate and taken up his station under a clump of trees at the autocrat's behest, he strove to soothe his ruffled feelings by the argument that it was probably the absolutely correct deportment for a shooting party, his mind remained unconvinced. Moreover, in parting from him, the keeper had dropped a blunt injunction about firing up or down the lane, the tone even more than the matter of which nettled him. To cap all, when he presently ventured to stroll about a little from the spot on which he had been planted, he caught a glimpse against the skyline of the distant Lord Plowden, comfortably seated on the stool which his valet had been carrying."}, {"size": 703, "text": "It seemed to Thorpe at that moment that he had never wanted to sit down so much before in his life--and he turned on his heel in the wet grass with a grunt of displeasure. This mood vanished utterly a few moments later. The remote sounds had begun to come to him, of boys shouting and dogs barking, in the recesses of the strip of woodland which the lane skirted, and at these he hastened back to his post. It did not seem to him a good place, and when he heard the reports of guns to right and left of him, and nothing came his way, he liked it less than ever; it had become a matter of offended pride with him, however, to relieve the keeper of no atom of the responsibility he had taken upon himself."}, {"size": 733, "text": "If Lord Plowden's guest had no sport, the blame for it should rest upon Lord Plowden's over-arrogant keeper.

He strained his eyes upon the horizon of the thicket--and, as if by instinct, the gun sprang up to adjust its sight to this eager gaze, and followed automatically the thundering course of the big bird, and then, taking thought to itself, leaped ahead of it and fired. Thorpe's first pheasant reeled in the air, described a somersault, and fell like a plummet."}, {"size": 613, "text": "He stirred not a step, but reloaded the barrel with a hand shaking for joy. From where he stood he could see the dead bird; there could never have been a cleaner \u201ckill.\u201d In the warming glow of his satisfaction in himself, there kindled a new liking of a different sort for Plowden and Balder. He owed to them, at this belated hour of his life, a novel delight of indescribable charm. There came to him, from the woods, the shrill bucolic voice of the keeper, admonishing a wayward dog. He was conscious of even a certain tenderness for this keeper--and again the cry of \u201cmark!\u201d rose, strenuously addressed to him."}, {"size": 700, "text": "Half an hour later the wood had been cleared, and Thorpe saw the rest of the party assembling by the gate.

It pleased him tremendously that no one had thought it worth while to approach the rendezvous by way of the spot he had covered. His eye took instant stock of the game carried by two of the boys; their combined prizes were eight birds and a rabbit, and his heart leaped within him at the count. \u201cWell, Thorpe?\u201d asked Plowden, pleasantly. The smell of gunpowder and the sight of stained feathers had co-operated to brighten and cheer his mood."}, {"size": 273, "text": "\u201cI heard you blazing away in great form.

He set down to it without hesitation the visible augmentation of deference to him among the servants. The temptation was very great to believe that it had affected the ladies of the house as well. He could not say that they were more gracious to him, but certainly they appeared to take him more for granted. In a hundred little ways, he seemed to perceive that he was no longer held mentally at arm's length as a stranger to their caste."}, {"size": 607, "text": "Of course, his own restored self-confidence could account for much of this, but he clung to the whimsical conceit that much was also due to the fact that he was the man of the pheasants. Sunday was bleak and stormy, and no one stirred out of the house. He was alone again with the ladies at breakfast, and during the long day he was much in their company. It was like no other day he had ever imagined to himself. On the morrow, in the morning train by which he returned alone to town, his mind roved luxuriously among the fragrant memories of that day. He had been so perfectly at home--and in such a home!"}, {"size": 477, "text": "There were some things which came uppermost again and again--but of them all he dwelt most fixedly upon the recollection of moving about in the greenhouses and conservatories, with that tall, stately, fair Lady Cressage for his guide, and watching her instead of the flowers that she pointed out. Of what she had told him, not a syllable stuck in his mind, but the music of the voice lingered in his ears. \u201cAnd she is old Kervick's daughter!\u201d he said to himself more than once."}, {"size": 657, "text": "IT may be that every other passenger in that morning train to London nursed either a silent rage, or declaimed aloud to fellow-sufferers in indignation, at the time consumed in making what, by the map, should be so brief a journey. In Thorpe's own compartment, men spoke with savage irony of cyclists alleged to be passing them on the road, and exchanged dark prophecies as to the novelties in imbecility and helplessness which the line would be preparing for the Christmas holidays. The old joke about people who had gone travelling years before, and were believed to be still lost somewhere in the recesses of Kent, revived itself amid gloomy approbation."}, {"size": 665, "text": "The still older discussion as to whether the South Eastern or the Brighton was really the worst followed naturally in its wake, and occupied its accustomed half-hour--complicated, however, upon this occasion, by the chance presence of a loquacious stranger who said he lived on the Chatham-and-Dover, and who rejected boisterously the idea that any other railway could be half so bad. The intrusion of this outsider aroused instant resentment, and the champions of the South Eastern and the Brighton, having piled up additional defenses in the shape of personal recollections of delay and mismanagement quite beyond belief, made a combined attack upon the newcomer."}, {"size": 659, "text": "He was evidently incapable, their remarks implied, of knowing a bad railway when he saw one. To suggest that the characterless and inoffensive Chatham-and-Dover, so commonplace in its tame virtues, was to be mentioned in the same breath with the daringly inventive and resourceful malefactors whose rendezvous was London Bridge, showed either a weak mind or a corrupt heart. Did this man really live on the Dover line at all? Angry countenances plainly reflected the doubt. But to Thorpe the journey seemed short enough--almost too short. The conversation interested him not at all; if he had ever known the Southern lines apart, they were all one to him now."}, {"size": 678, "text": "He looked out of the window, and could have sworn that he thought of nothing but the visit from which he was returning. When he alighted at Cannon Street, however, it was to discover that his mind was full of a large, new, carefully-prepared project. It came to him, ready-made and practically complete, as he stood on the platform, superintending the porter's efforts to find his bags. He turned it over and over in his thoughts, in the hansom, more to familiarize himself with its details than to add to them. He left the cab to wait for him at the mouth of a little alley which delves its way into Old Broad Street through towering walls of commercial buildings, old and new."}, {"size": 727, "text": "Colin Semple was happily in his office--a congeries of small, huddled rooms, dry and dirty with age, which had a doorway of its own in a corner of the court--and Thorpe pushed on to his room at the end like one who is assured of both his way and his welcome. The broker was standing beside a desk, dictating a letter to a clerk who sat at it, and with only a nod to Thorpe he proceeded to finish this task. He looked more than once at his visitor as he did so, in a preoccupied, impersonal way. To the other's notion, he seemed the personification of business--without an ounce of distracting superfluous flesh upon his wiry, tough little frame, without a trace of unnecessary politeness, or humour, or sensibility of any sort."}, {"size": 604, "text": "He was the machine perfected and fined down to absolute essentials. He could understand a joke if it was useful to him to do so. He could drink, and even smoke cigarettes, with a natural air, if these exercises seemed properly to belong to the task he had in hand. Thorpe did not conceive him doing anything for the mere human reason that he liked to do it. There was more than a touch of what the rustic calls \u201cginger\u201d in his hair and closely-cropped, pointed beard, and he had the complementary florid skin. His eyes--notably direct, confident eyes--were of a grey which had in it more brown than blue."}, {"size": 613, "text": "He wore a black frock-coat, buttoned close, and his linen produced the effect of a conspicuous whiteness. He turned as the clerk left the room, and let his serious, thin lips relax for an instant as a deferred greeting. \u201cWell?\u201d he asked, impassively. \u201cHave you got a quarter-of-an-hour?\u201d asked Thorpe in turn. \u201cI want a talk with you.\u201d For answer, Semple left the room. Returning after a minute or two, he remarked, \u201cGo ahead till we're stopped,\u201d and seated himself on the corner of the desk with the light inconsequence of a bird on a twig.

The broker twitched his shoulders slightly. \u201cGo on,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the idea is everything,\u201d protested the other. \u201cWe've been thinking of beginning the campaign straight away--but the true game now is to lie low--silent as the grave. I go away now, d'ye see? Nothing particular is said about it, of course, but in a month or two somebody notices that I'm not about, and he happens to mention it to somebody else--and so there gets to be the impression that things haven't gone well with me, d'ye see?"}, {"size": 647, "text": "On the same plan, I let all the clerks at my office go. The Secretary'll come round every once in a while to get letters, of course, and perhaps he'll keep a boy in the front office for show, but practically the place'll be shut up. That'll help out the general impression that I've gone to pieces. Now d'ye see?\u201d \u201cIt's the Special Settlement you're thinking of,\u201d commented Semple. \u201cOf course. The fellows that we're going to squeeze would move heaven and hell to prevent our getting that Settlement, if they got wind of what was going on. The only weak point in our game is just there. Absolutely everything hangs on the Settlement being granted."}, {"size": 636, "text": "Naturally, then, our play is to concentrate everything on getting it granted. We don't want to raise the remotest shadow of a suspicion of what we're up to, till after we're safe past that rock. So we go on in the way to attract the least possible attention. You or your jobber makes the ordinary application for a Special Settlement, with your six signatures and so on; and I go abroad quietly, and the office is as good as shut up, and nobody makes a peep about Rubber Consols--and the thing works itself. You do see it, don't you?\u201d \u201cI see well enough the things that are to be seen,\u201d replied Semple, with a certain brevity of manner."}, {"size": 647, "text": "\u201cThere was a sermon of my father's that I remember, and it had for its text, 'We look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen.'\u201d Thorpe, pondering this for a moment, nodded his head. \u201cSemple,\u201d he said, bringing his chair forward to the desk, \u201cthat's what I've come for. I want to spread my cards on the table for you. I know the sum you've laid out already, in working this thing. We'll say that that is to be paid back to you, as a separate transaction, and we'll put that to one side. Now then, leaving that out of consideration, what do you think you ought to have out of the winnings, when we pull the thing off?"}, {"size": 671, "text": "Mind, I'm not thinking of your 2,000 vendor's shares----\u201d \u201cNo--I'm not thinking much of them, either,\u201d interposed Semple, with a kind of dry significance. \u201cOh, they'll be all right,\u201d Thorpe affirmed. He laughed unconsciously as he did so. \u201cNo, what I want to get at is your idea of what should come to you, as a bonus, when I scoop the board.\u201d \u201cTwenty thousand pounds,\u201d said Semple, readily. Thorpe's slow glance brightened a trifle. \u201cI had thought thirty would be a fairer figure,\u201d he remarked, with an effort at simplicity. The broker put out his under-lip. \u201cYou will find people rather disposed to distrust a man who promises more than he's asked,\u201d he remarked coldly."}, {"size": 800, "text": "\u201cYes--I know what you mean,\u201d Thorpe hurried to say, flushing awkwardly, even though the remark was so undeserved; \u201cbut it's in my nature.

Why\u201d--he halted to consider the advisability of disclosing what he had promised to do for Lord Plowden, and decided against it--\u201cwhy, without you, what would the whole thing have been worth to me? Take one thing alone--the money for the applications--I could have no more got at it than I could at the Crown Jewels in the Tower. I've wondered since, more than once--if you don't mind the question--how did you happen to have so much ready money lying about.\u201d \u201cThere are some Glasgow and Aberdeen folk who trust me to invest for them,\u201d the broker explained."}, {"size": 634, "text": "\u201cIf they get five per cent. for the four months, they'll be very pleased.

That is nearly three months. Then the work of taking fort-nightly profits will begin--and it is for you to say how long you allow that to go on.\u201d \u201cBut about the two thousand pounds now,\u201d Thorpe reminded him. \u201cI think I will do that in this way,\u201d said Semple, kicking his small legs nonchalantly. \u201cI will buy two thousand fully-paid shares of you, for cash down, NOT vendor's shares, you observe--and then I will take your acknowledgment that you hold them for me in trust up to a given date."}, {"size": 662, "text": "In that way, I would not at all weaken your market, and I would have a stake in the game.\u201d \u201cYour stake's pretty big, already,\u201d commented Thorpe, tentatively. \u201cIt's just a fancy of mine,\u201d said the other, with his first smile. \u201cI like to hold shares that are making sensational advances. It is very exciting.\u201d \u201cAll right,\u201d said Thorpe, in accents of resignation. He wrote out two letters, accepting the wording which Semple suggested from his perch on the desk, and then the latter, hopping down, took the chair in turn and wrote a cheque. \u201cDo you want it open?\u201d he asked over his shoulder. \u201cAre you going to get it cashed at once?\u201d \u201cNo--cross it,\u201d said the other."}, {"size": 626, "text": "\u201cI want it to go through my bankers.

I've had business in Frankfort once, and in Rotterdam once, and in Paris twice. That is all.\u201d \u201cBut don't you ever do anything for pleasure?\u201d Thorpe asked him, as he folded the cheque in his pocket-book. \u201cOh yes--many things,\u201d responded the broker, lightly. \u201cIt's a pleasure, for example, to buy Rubber Consols at par.\u201d \u201cOh, if you call it buying,\u201d said Thorpe, and then softened his words with an apologetic laugh."}, {"size": 809, "text": "\u201cI didn't tell you, did I?

That isn't the usual form with guinea-pigs.\u201d \u201cAh, but, he isn't the guinea-pig variety at all,\u201d Thorpe asserted, warmly. \u201cHe's really a splendid fellow--with his little oddities, like the rest of us, of course, but a decent chap all through. Place? I should think he HAD got a place! It's one of the swellest old country-houses you ever saw--older than hell, you know--and it's kept up as if they had fifty thousand a year.

He had been as anxious about pence as the hungriest of those poor devils, only a week before. And now! He thrust up the door in the roof of the cab, and bade the driver stop at his bank. Thence, after some brief but very agreeable business, and a hurried inspection of the \u201cCourt\u201d section of a London Directory, he drove to a telegraph station and despatched two messages."}, {"size": 759, "text": "They were identical in terms. One sought General Kervick at his residence--he was in lodgings somewhere in the Hanover Square country--and the other looked for him at his club.

Thorpe dismissed the cab at his hotel--an unpretentious house in Craven Street, and sent his luggage to his rooms. There were no letters for him on the board in the hallway, and he sauntered up to the Strand. As by force of habit, he turned presently into a side-street, and stopped opposite the ancient book-shop of his family. In the bright yet mellow light of the sunny autumn noontide, the blacks and roans and smoked drabs of the low old brick front looked more dingy to his eye than ever."}, {"size": 755, "text": "It spoke of antiquity, no doubt, but it was a dismal and graceless antiquity of narrow purposes and niggling thrift. It was so little like the antiquity, for example, of Hadlow House, that the two might have computed their age by the chronological systems of different planets.

A small boy guarded these wares, and Thorpe considered him briefly, with curious recollections of how much of his own boyhood had been spent on that very spot."}, {"size": 801, "text": "The lad under observation had a loutish and sullen face; its expression could not have been more devoid of intellectual suggestions if he had been posted in a Wiltshire field to frighten crows with a rattle, instead of being set here in the highway of the world's brain-movement, an agent of students and philosophers. Thorpe wondered if in his time he could have looked such a vacant and sour young fool. No--no. That could not be. Boys were different in his day--and especially boys in book-shops. They read something and knew something of what they handled. They had some sort of aspirations, fitful and vague as these might be, to become in their time bookmen also. And in those days there still were bookmen--widely-informed, observant, devoted old bookmen--who loved their trade, and adorned it."}, {"size": 664, "text": "Thorpe reflected that, as he grew older, he was the better able to apprehend the admirable qualities of that departed race of literature's servants. Indeed, it seemed that he had never adequately realized before how proud a man might well be of descending from a line of such men. The thought struck him that very likely at this identical doorway, two generations back, a poor, out-at-the-elbows, young law-student named Plowden had stood and turned over pages of books he could not dream of buying. Perhaps, even, he had ventured inside, and deferentially picked acquaintance with the Thorpe of the period, and got bookish advice and friendly counsel for nothing."}, {"size": 632, "text": "It was of no real significance that the law-student grew to be Lord Chancellor, and the bookseller remained a book-seller; in the realm of actual values, the Thorpes were as good as the Plowdens.

It's all mystery and sleight-of-hand and the confidence trick--medicine is--and if you haven't got just the right twist of the wrist, you're not in it. But an artist stands on his merits. There is his work--done by his own hands. It speaks for itself. There's no deception--it's easy enough to tell whether it's good or bad. If the pictures are good, people buy them.

The young people smiled back at him, and with this he rearranged his feet in a new posture on the opposite seat, lighted another cigar, and pillowed his head once more against the hard, red-plush cushion. Personally, he did not in the least resent the failure of the scenery. For something more than three months, this purposeless pleasure-tour had been dragging him about from point to point, sleeping in strange beds, eating extraordinarily strange food, transacting the affairs of a sight-seer among people who spoke strange languages, until he was surfeited with the unusual."}, {"size": 794, "text": "It had all been extremely interesting, of course, and deeply improving--but he was getting tired of talking to nobody but waiters, and still more so of having nothing to do which he could not as well leave undone if he chose. After a few days more of Switzerland--for they had already gazed with blank faces at this universal curtain of mist from such different points of view as Lucerne, Interlaken, and Thun--it was clear to him that they would, as he phrased it, to himself, make a break for home. Unless, indeed, something happened at Montreux. Ah, would anything happen at Montreux? For four days his mind had been automatically reverting to that question; it lurked continually in the background of his thoughts, now, as he smoked and idly ruminated, on his way southward through the fog."}, {"size": 653, "text": "All the rest of the prolonged trip had been without any specific motive, so far as he was concerned. The youngsters had planned all its routes and halts and details of time and connections, and he had gone along, with cheerful placidity, to look at the things they bade him observe, and to pay the bills. Perhaps in all things their tastes had not been his tastes. He would have liked more of Paris, he fancied, and less of the small Dutch and North German towns which they seemed to fancy so much. Still, the beer was good--and really their happiness, as a spectacle, had given him more satisfaction than a thousand miles of boulevards could have done."}, {"size": 644, "text": "He liked this niece and nephew of his more than he could ever have imagined himself liking any young people. They had been shy with him at the outset--and for the first week his experiment had been darkened by the belief that, between themselves, they did not deem him quite good enough. He had been wise enough, then, to have it out with the girl--she was the one to whom he felt it easiest to talk frankly--and had discovered, to his immense relief, that they conceived him to be regarding them as encumbrances. At breakfast next morning, with tactful geniality, he set everything right, and thereafter they were all extremely happy together."}, {"size": 610, "text": "So far as he could judge, they were very superior young people, both intellectually and spiritually. The girl spoke French, and her brother German, with what seemed to him remarkable proficiency. Their young minds were the repositories of an astounding amount of information: they knew who Charles the Bold was; they pointed out to their uncle the distinction between Gothic and Romanesque arches; they explained what was the matter with the Anabaptists; they told him that the story of the Bishop and the rats at Bingen was a baseless myth, and that probably there had never been any such man as William Tell."}, {"size": 635, "text": "Nor did they get all this out of the guide-books which they pored over with such zest. It was impossible not to see that they were familiar with large numbers of the subjects that these books discussed, and that the itinerary which they marked out had reference to desires and interests that they had cultivated for themselves. Julia, upon even first sight, made a much pleasanter impression than her mother's hesitating description had prepared him for. As he came to know her well, he ceased to remember that there was a question in any mind as to her being a pretty girl. There was less colour in her face than he could have wished."}, {"size": 823, "text": "Her smooth, pallid skin, almost waxen in texture, had a suggestion of delicate health which sometimes troubled him a little, but which appealed to the tenderness in his nature all the time. The face was unduly thin, perhaps, but this, and the wistful glance of the large grey eyes in repose, made up an effect that Thorpe found touched him a good deal. Even when she was in visibly high spirits, the look in these eyes seemed to him to be laying claim to his protection. She could be merry upon occasion, in a gentle and tranquil way, and as her self-confidence expanded under the shelter of their growing intimacy, she disclosed to her uncle plenty of initiative and individuality--but what he felt in her most was a peculiarly sweet and girlish trustfulness, which made him like himself more than he had ever done before."}, {"size": 721, "text": "He could feel that he was at his very best--a hitherto unsuspected best--when Julia was about. He wanted to buy for her everything in the windows upon which she bestowed the most casual approving glance. It was a delight merely to look at her, and to meditate upon the felicity of being able to do things for so charming a girl. Alfred made a less direct demand upon his uncle's admiration, but he was a very good fellow all round. He was big and fair and muscular, and nothing about him but his spectacles seemed in Thorpe's mind to be related to his choice of art as a profession. That so robust and hearty a young fellow should wish to put paint on a canvas with small brushes, was to the uncle an unaccountable thing."}, {"size": 618, "text": "It was almost as if he had wanted to knit, or do embroidery. Of the idleness and impatience of discipline which his mother had seemed to allege against him, Thorpe failed to detect any signs. The young man was never very late in the morning, and, beside his tireless devotion to the task of hunting up old pictures in out-of-the-way places, did most of the steward's work of the party with intelligence and precision. He studied the time-tables, audited the hotel-bills, looked after the luggage, got up the street-maps of towns and the like, to such good purpose that they never lost a train, or a bag, or themselves."}, {"size": 750, "text": "Truly, an excellent young man. Thorpe noted with especial satisfaction his fine, kindly big-brother attitude toward his sister Julia--and it was impossible for him to avoid the conviction that Louisa was a simpleton not to appreciate such children. They did not often allude to their mother; when they did, it was in language the terms of which seemed more affectionate than the tone--and Thorpe said often to himself that he did not blame them. It was not so much that they had outgrown their mother's point of view. They had never occupied it. The journey, so far as Thorpe comprehended its character, had been shaped with about equal regard for Julia's interest in the romance of history, and Alfred's more technical and practical interest in art."}, {"size": 751, "text": "Each had sufficient sympathy with the tastes of the other, however, to prevent any tendency to separation. They took their uncle one day to see where William the Silent was assassinated, and the next to observe how Rembrandt's theory of guild portrait-painting differed from Van der Helst's, with a common enthusiasm. He scrutinized with patient loyalty everything that they indicated to him, and not infrequently they appeared to like very much the comments he offered. These were chiefly of a sprightly nature, and when Julia laughed over them he felt that she was very near to him indeed. Thus they saw Paris together--where Thorpe did relinquish some of the multiplied glories of the Louvre to sit in front of a cafe by the Opera House and see the"}, {"size": 628, "text": "funny people go past--and thence, by Bruges and Antwerp, to Holland, where nobody could have imagined there were as many pictures as Thorpe saw with his own weary eyes. There were wonderful old buildings at Lubeck for Julia's eyes to glisten over, and pictures at Berlin, Dresden, and Dusseldorf for Alfred. The assumption existed that the excursion into the Thuringenwald to see the memorials of Luther was especially for the uncle's benefit, and he tried solicitously to say or look nothing which might invalidate it. There were other places in Germany, from Mainz to Munich, which he remembered best by their different beers."}, {"size": 619, "text": "They spent Christmas at Vienna, where Julia had heard that its observance was peculiarly insisted upon, and then they saw the Tyrol in its heaviest vesture of winter snows, and beautiful old Basle, where Alfred was crazier about Holbein than he had been at Munich over Brouwer. Thorpe looked very carefully at the paintings of both men, and felt strengthened in his hopes that when Alfred got a little older he would see that this picture business was not the thing for a young gentleman with prospects to go into. It was at Basle that Thorpe received a letter from London which directly altered the plans of the party."}, {"size": 755, "text": "He had had several other letters from London which had produced no such effect. Through Semple, he had followed in outline the unobtrusive campaign to secure a Special Settlement, and had learned that the Stock Exchange Committee, apparently without opposition, had granted one for the first week in February. Even this news, tremendously important as it was, did not prompt Thorpe to interfere with the children's projects. There was no longer any point in remaining away from London; there were, indeed, numerous reasons for a prompt return. But he was loth to deprive the youngsters of that descent into smiling, sunlit Italy upon which they had so fondly dwelt in fancy, and after all Semple could do all that was needful to be done for another month."}, {"size": 649, "text": "So they went to Basle, and here it was that another kind of letter came. It was in a strange hand, at once cramped and fluttering, which puzzled the recipient a good deal; it was a long time before even the signature unravelled itself. Then he forced himself to decipher it, sentence by sentence, with a fierce avidity. It was from General Kervick. The next morning Thorpe astonished his young companions by suggesting an alteration in their route. In a roundabout and tentative fashion--in which more suspicious observers must have detected something shamefaced--he mentioned that he had always heard a great deal about Montreux as a winter-resort."}, {"size": 703, "text": "The fact that he called it Montroox raised in Julia's mind a fleeting wonder from whom it could be that he had heard so much about it, but it occurred to neither her nor her brother to question his entire good faith. Their uncle had displayed, hitherto, a most comforting freedom from discrimination among European towns; he had, indeed, assured them many times that they were all one to him. That he should suddenly turn up now with a favourite winter-resort of his own selection surprised them considerably, but, upon reflection, it also pleased them. He had humoured all their wishes with such unfailing and bountiful kindness, that it was a delight to learn that there was something he wanted to do."}, {"size": 634, "text": "They could not finish their breakfast till the guide-book had been brought to the table. \u201cOh! How splendid!\u201d Julia had cried then. \u201cThe Castle of Chillon is there!\u201d \u201cWhy of course!\u201d said Thorpe, complacently. They laughed gayly at him for pretending that he had known this, and he as good-humouredly accepted their banter. He drew a serious long breath of relief, however, when their backs were turned. It had gone off much better than he had feared. Now, on this Sunday afternoon, as the train made its sure-footed way across the mountains, the thought that he was actually to alight at Montreux at once fascinated and depressed him."}, {"size": 793, "text": "He was annoyed with himself for suffering it to get such a hold upon his mind. What was there in it, anyway? There was a big hotel there, and he and his youngsters were to stop at it, and if he accidentally encountered a certain lady who was also stopping there--and of course the meeting would bear upon its face the stamp of pure chance--what of it? And if he did meet her, thus fortuitously--what would happen then? No doubt a lady of her social position met abroad great numbers of people that she had met at home. It would not in any way surprise her--this chance encounter of which he thought so much. Were there sufficient grounds for imagining that it would even interest her? He forced his mind up to this question, as it were, many times, and invariably it shied and evaded the leap."}, {"size": 737, "text": "There had been times, at Hadlow House, when Lady Cressage had seemed supremely indifferent to the fact of his existence, and there had been other times when it had appeared manifest that he pleased her--or better, perhaps, that she was willing to take note of how much she pleased him. It must have been apparent to her--this fact that she produced such an impression upon him. He reasoned this out satisfactorily to himself. These beautiful women, trained from childhood for the conquest of a rich husband, must have cultivated an extraordinary delicacy of consciousness, in such matters. They must have developed for themselves what might be called a sixth sense--a power of feeling in the air what the men about were thinking of them."}, {"size": 665, "text": "More than once he had caught a glimmer of what he felt to be the operation of this sense, in the company of Lady Cressage. He could not say that it had been discernible in her glance, or her voice, or her manner, precisely, but he was sure that he had seen it, somehow. But even assuming all this--admitting that in October, on a wet Sunday, in the tedium of a small country-house party, she had shown some momentary satisfaction in the idea that he was profoundly impressed by her--did it at all follow that in February, amid the distractions of a fashionable winter-resort, and probably surrounded by hosts of friends, she would pay any attention to him whatever?"}, {"size": 649, "text": "The abject fear that she might not even remember him--might not know him from Adam when he stood before her--skulked about in the labyrinths of his mind, but he drove it back whenever it showed itself. That would be too ignominious. The young people at the other side of the compartment, forever wiping the window with the napkin, and straining their eyes to see the invisible, diverted his unsettled attention. A new perception of how much he liked them and enjoyed having them with him, took hold of his thoughts. It had not occurred to him before, with any definiteness, that he would be insupportably lonely when the time came to part with them."}, {"size": 646, "text": "Now, when he dwelt upon it, it made him feel sad and old. He said to himself at once, with decision, that there need be no parting at all. He would take a house without delay, and they should live with him. He could not doubt that this would be agreeable to them; it would solve every problem for him. His fancy sketched out the natural and legitimate extensions of this project. There would be, first of all, a house in town--a furnished house of a modest sort, having no pretension save to provide a cheerful temporary shelter for three people who liked one another. Here the new household would take shape, and get its right note of character."}, {"size": 824, "text": "Apparently Louisa would not be urged to form part of this household. He said to himself with frankness that he didn't want her, and there had been nothing to indicate that her children would pine for her. She showed good sense when she said that her place was in the shop, and in her ancestral home over the shop. No doubt there would be a certain awkwardness, visible to others if not to themselves, about her living in one part of London and her children in another. But here also her good sense would come on;--and, besides, this furnished house in town would be a mere brief overture to the real thing--the noble country mansion he was going to have, with gardens and horses and hounds and artificial lakes and deer parks and everything. Quite within the year he would be able to realize this consummation of his dreams."}, {"size": 670, "text": "How these nice young people would revel in such a place--and how they would worship him for having given it to them for a home! His heart warmed within him as he thought of this. He smiled affectionately at the picture Julia made, polishing the glass with vehement circular movements of her slight arm, and then grimacing in comic vexation at the deadly absence of landscape outside. Was there ever a sweeter or more lovable girl in this world? Would there have to be some older woman to manage the house, at the beginning? he wondered. He should like it immensely if that could be avoided. Julia looked fragile and inexperienced--but she would be twenty-one next month."}, {"size": 663, "text": "Surely that was a mature enough age for the slight responsibility of presiding over servants who should be the best that money could buy. Many girls were married, and given households of their own to manage, when they were even younger. This reflection raised an obstacle against the smooth-flowing current of his thoughts. Supposing that Julia got the notion of marrying--how miserable that would make everything. Very likely she would never do any such thing; he had observed in her no shadow of a sign that a thought of matrimony had ever crossed her brain. Yet that was a subject upon which, of course, she could not be asked to give pledges, even to herself."}, {"size": 674, "text": "Thorpe tried to take a liberal view of this matter. He argued to himself that there would be no objection at all to incorporating Julia's husband into the household, assuming that she went to the length of taking one, and that he was a good fellow. On this latter point, it was only the barest justice to Julia's tastes and judgment to take it for granted that he would be a good fellow. Yet the uncle felt uneasily that this would alter things for the worse. The family party, with that hypothetical young man in it, could never be quite so innocently and completely happy as--for instance--the family party in this compartment had been during these wonderful three months."}, {"size": 750, "text": "Mechanically he rubbed the window beside him, and turned to look out with a certain fixedness--as if he might chance to catch a glimpse of the bridegroom with whom Julia would have it in her power to disturb the serenity of their prospective home. A steep white cliff, receding sullenly against the dim grey skyline; a farmhouse grotesquely low for its size, crouching under big shelving galleries heaped with snow; an opening in front, to the right, where vaguely there seemed to be a valley into which they would descend--he saw these things. They remained in his mind afterward as a part of something else that he saw, with his mental vision, at the same moment--a strikingly real and vivid presentment of Lady Cressage, attired as he had seen her"}, {"size": 638, "text": "in the saddle, her light hair blown about a little under her hat, a spot of colour in the exquisite cheek, the cold, impersonal dignity of a queen in the beautiful profile. The picture was so actual for the instant that he uttered an involuntary exclamation--and then looked hastily round to see whether his companions had heard it. Seemingly they had not; he lolled again upon the comfortless cushion, and strove to conjure up once more the apparition. Nothing satisfactory came of the effort. Upon consideration, he grew uncertain as to whether he had seen anything at all. At the most it was a kind of half-dream which had visited him."}, {"size": 636, "text": "He yawned at the thought, and lighted a fresh cigar. All at once, his mind had become too indolent to do any more thinking. A shapeless impression that there would be a good many things to think over later on flitted into his brain and out again. \u201cWell, how are the mountains using you, now?\u201d he called out to his niece. \u201cOh, I could shake them!\u201d she declared. \u201cListen to this: 'A view of singular beauty, embracing the greater part of the Lake of Geneva, and the surrounding mountains, is suddenly disclosed.' That's where we are now--or were a minute ago. You can see that there is some sort of valley in front of us--but that is all."}, {"size": 627, "text": "If I could only see one mountain with snow on it----\u201d \u201cWhy, it's all mountains and all snow, when you come to that,\u201d Thorpe insisted, with jocose perversity. \u201cYou're on mountains yourself, all the time.\u201d \u201cYou know what I mean,\u201d she retorted. \u201cI want to see something like the coloured pictures in the hotels.\u201d \u201cOh, probably it will be bright sunlight tomorrow,\u201d he said, for perhaps the twentieth time that day. \u201cThere--that looks like water!\u201d said Alfred. \u201cSee? just beyond the village. Yes, it is water. There's your Lake of Geneva, at all events.\u201d \u201cBut it isn't the right colour,\u201d protested Julia, peering through the glass."}, {"size": 449, "text": "\u201cIt's precisely like everything else: it's of no colour at all. And they always paint it such a lovely blue! Really, uncle, the Swiss Government ought to return you your money.\u201d \u201cYou wait till you see it tomorrow--or next day,\u201d said the uncle, vaguely. He closed his eyes, and welcomed a drowsy mood. As he went off to sleep, the jolting racket of the train mellowed itself into a murmur of \u201ctomorrow or next day, tomorrow or next day,\u201d in his ears."}, {"size": 862, "text": "FROM their windows, high up and at the front of the big hotel, Julia looked down upon the Lake of Geneva. She was in such haste to behold it that she had not so much as unbuttoned her gloves; she held her muff still in her hand. After one brief glance, she groaned aloud with vexation. Beyond the roadway, and the deserted miniature pier of Territet, both dishevelled under melting and mud-stained snow, there lay a patch of water--motionless, inconspicuous, of a faded drab colour--which at some small distance out vaguely ceased to look like water and, yet a little further out, became part and parcel of the dull grey mist. Save for the forlorn masts of a couple of fishing boats, beached under the shelter of the pier, there was no proof in sight that this was a lake at all. It was as uninspiring to the eye as a pool of drippings from umbrellas in a porch."}, {"size": 648, "text": "While her uncle and brother occupied themselves with the luggage being brought up by the porters, she opened a window and stepped out upon the tiny balcony. A flaring sign on the inner framework of this balcony besought her in Swiss-French, in the interests of order, not to feed the birds. The injunction seemed meaningless to her until she perceived, over by the water, several gulls lazily wheeling about. They were almost as grey as the fog they circled in. Suddenly they seemed to perceive her in turn, and, swerving sharply, came floating toward the hotel, with harsh, almost menacing cries. She hurried in, and shut the window with decision."}, {"size": 679, "text": "It seemed to her that the smile with which, as she turned, she was able to meet her uncle's look, was a product of true heroism. Apparently this smile did not altogether delude him. \u201cOh, now, you mustn't get down on your luck,\u201d he adjured her. \u201cWe're going to be awfully cozy here. Have you seen your room? It's just there, in a little alley to the right of the door. They say it has an even finer view than these windows. Oh, you needn't laugh--this is the best view in the world, I'm told by those who know. And as a winter-resort, why----\u201d \u201cI say, look here!\u201d The interruption came from Alfred, who, having gone out on one of the balconies, put in his head now to summon them."}, {"size": 651, "text": "\u201cCome here! Here's some fun.\u201d He pointed out to Thorpe the meaning of the inscription on the sign, and then pulled him forward to observe its practical defiance. A score of big gulls were flapping and dodging in excited confusion close before them, filling their ears with a painful clamour. Every now and again, one of the birds, recovering its senses in the hurly-burly, would make a curving swoop downward past the rows of windows below, and triumphantly catch in its beak something that had been thrown into the air. Thorpe, leaning over his railing, saw that a lady on a balcony one floor below, and some yards to the left, was feeding the birds."}, {"size": 683, "text": "She laughed aloud as she did so, and said something over her shoulder to a companion who was not visible. \u201cWell, that's pretty cool,\u201d he remarked to his niece, who had come to stand beside him. \u201cShe's got the same sign down there that we've got. I can see it from here. Or perhaps she can't read French.\u201d \u201cOr perhaps she isn't frightened of the hotel people,\u201d suggested the girl. She added, after a little, \u201cI think I'll feed them myself in the morning. I certainly shall if the sun comes out--as a sort of Thanksgiving festival, you know.\u201d Her uncle seemed not to hear her. He had been struck by the exceptional grace of the gestures with which the pieces of bread were flung forth."}, {"size": 787, "text": "The hands and wrists of this lady were very white and shapely. The movements which she made with them, all unaware of observation as she was, and viewed as he viewed them from above, were singularly beautiful in their unconstraint. It was in its way like watching some remarkable fine dancing, he thought. He could not see much of her face, from his perch, but she was tall and fashionably clad. There was a loose covering of black lace thrown over her head, but once, as she turned, he could see that her hair was red. Even in this fleeting glimpse, the unusual tint attracted his attention: there was a brilliancy as of fire in it. Somehow it seemed to make a claim upon his memory. He continued to stare down at the stranger with an indefinable sense that he knew something about her."}, {"size": 641, "text": "Suddenly another figure appeared upon the balcony--and in a flash he comprehended everything. These idiotic, fighting gluttons of gulls had actually pointed out to him the object of his search. It was Lady Cressage who stood in the doorway, there just below him--and her companion, the red-haired lady who laughed hotel-rules to scorn, was the American heiress who had crossed the ocean in his ship, and whom he had met later on at Hadlow. What was her name--Martin? No--Madden. He confronted the swift impression that there was something odd about these two women being together. At Hadlow he had imagined that they did not like each other."}, {"size": 636, "text": "Then he reflected as swiftly that women probably had their own rules about such matters. He seemed to have heard, or read, perhaps, that females liked and disliked each other with the most capricious alternations and on the least tangible of grounds. At all events, here they were together now. That was quite enough. The two ladies had gone in, and closed their window. The sophisticated birds, with a few ungrateful croaks of remonstrance, had drifted away again to the water. His niece had disappeared from his elbow. Still Thorpe remained with his arms folded on the railing, his eyes fixed on the vacant balcony, below to the left."}, {"size": 899, "text": "When at last he went inside, the young people were waiting for him with the project of a stroll before dinner. The light was failing, but there was plenty of time. They had ascertained the direction in which Chillon lay; a servant had assured them that it was only a few minutes' walk, and Alfred was almost certain that he had seen it from the window. Thorpe assented with a certain listlessness, which they had never noted in his manner before, but when Julia begged him not to stir if he were in the slightest degree tired, he replied honestly enough that he would do anything rather than be left alone. Then, of course, they said, there should be no walk, but to this he would not listen. The party trooped downstairs, accordingly, and out into the street. The walking was vile, but, as Julia had long ago said, if they were to be deterred by slush they would never get anywhere or see anything."}, {"size": 652, "text": "It proved to be too late and too dark to either enter the castle or get much of an idea of its exterior. Returning, they paused again to look into the lighted window of the nice little book-shop. The numerous photographs of what they were entitled to behold from the windows of their hotel seemed more convincing than photographs usually were. As the young people inspected them, they became reassured. It was not credible that such a noble vista would forever deny itself to such earnest pilgrims. When their uncle introduced this time his ancient formula about the certainty of brilliant sunshine in the morning, they somehow felt like believing him."}, {"size": 895, "text": "\u201cYes--I really think it must change,\u201d Julia declared, with her fascinated glance upon the photographs. Alfred looked at his watch. \u201cWe'd better get along to the hotel, hadn't we?\u201d he suggested. \u201cBy the way\u201d--Thorpe began, with a certain uneasiness of manner--\u201cspeaking of dinner, wouldn't you like to dine at the big table d'hote, instead of up in our sitting-room?\u201d \u201cIf you're tired of our dining alone--by all means,\u201d answered Julia, readily. There was obvious surprise, however, in both her look and tone. \u201cTired nothing!\u201d he assured her. \u201cI like it better than anything else in the world. But what I mean is--I was thinking, seeing that this is such a great winter-resort, and all the swagger people of Europe come here--that probably you youngsters would enjoy seeing the crowd.\u201d Julia's glance, full of affectionate appreciation, showed how wholly she divined his spirit of self-sacrifice."}, {"size": 680, "text": "\u201cWe wouldn't care in the least for it,\u201d she declared. \u201cWe enjoy being a little party by ourselves every whit as much as you do--and we both hate the people you get at table d'hotes--and besides, for that matter, if there are any real swells here, you may be sure they dine in their own rooms.\u201d \u201cWhy, of course!\u201d Thorpe exclaimed swiftly, in palpable self-rebuke. \u201cI don't know what I could have been thinking of. Of course they would dine in their rooms.\u201d Next morning, Thorpe rose earlier than ever--with the impression of a peculiarly restless and uncomfortable night behind him. It was not until he had shaved and dressed that he noted the altered character of the air outside."}, {"size": 740, "text": "Although it was not fully daylight yet, he could see the outlines of the trees and vinerows on the big, snow-clad hill, which monopolized the prospect from his window, all sharp and clear cut, as if he were looking at them through an opera-glass. He went at once to the sitting-room, and thrust the curtains aside from one of the windows. A miracle had been wrought in the night. The sky overhead was serenely cloudless; the lake beneath, stirring softly under some faint passing breeze, revealed its full breadth with crystalline distinctness. Between sky and water there stretched across the picture a broad, looming, dimly-defined band of shadow, marked here and there at the top by little slanting patches of an intensely glowing white."}, {"size": 805, "text": "He looked at this darkling middle distance for a moment or two without comprehension. Then he turned and hurriedly moved to the door of Julia's room and beat upon it. \u201cGet up!\u201d he called through the panels. \u201cHere's your sunrise--here's your Alpine view. Go to your window and see it!\u201d A clear voice, not unmirthful, replied: \u201cI've been watching it for half an hour, thanks. Isn't it glorious?\u201d He was more fortunate at the opposite door, for Alfred was still asleep. The young man, upon hearing the news, however, made a toilet of unexampled brevity, and came breathlessly forth. Thorpe followed him to the balcony, where he stood collarless and uncombed, with the fresh morning breeze blowing his hair awry, his lips parted, his eyes staring with what the uncle felt to be a painful fixedness before him."}, {"size": 673, "text": "Thorpe had seen many mountains in many lands. They did not interest him very much. He thought, however, that he could see now why people who had no mountains of their own should get excited about Switzerland. He understood a number of these sentimental things now, for that matter, which had been Greek to him three months before. Unreceptive as his philistinism may have seemed to these delightful youngsters, it was apparent enough to him that they had taught him a great deal. If he could not hope to share their ever-bubbling raptures and enthusiasms, at least he had come to comprehend them after a fashion, and even to discern sometimes what it was that stirred them."}, {"size": 616, "text": "He watched his nephew now--having first assured himself by a comprehensive downward glance that no other windows of the hotel-front were open. The young man seemed tremendously moved, far too much so to talk. Thorpe ventured once some remarks about the Mexican mountains, which were ever so much bigger, as he remembered them, but Alfred paid no heed. He continued to gaze across the lake, watching in rapt silence one facet after another catch the light, and stand out from the murky gloom, radiantly white, till at last the whole horizon was a mass of shining minarets and domes, and the sun fell full on his face."}, {"size": 821, "text": "Then, with a long-drawn sigh, he turned, re-entered the room, and threw himself into a chair. \u201cIt's too good!\u201d he declared, with a half-groan. \u201cI didn't know it would be like that.\u201d \u201cWhy nothing's too good for us, man,\u201d his uncle told him. \u201cTHAT is,\u201d said the boy, simply, and Thorpe, after staring for a moment, smiled and rang the bell for breakfast. When Julia made her appearance, a few minutes later, the table was already laid, and the waiter was coming in with the coffee. \u201cI thought we'd hurry up breakfast,\u201d her uncle explained, after she had kissed him and thanked him for the sunrise he had so successfully predicted--\u201cbecause I knew you'd both be crazy to get out.\u201d He had not over-estimated their eagerness, which was so great, indeed, that they failed to note the excessive tranquility of his own demeanour."}, {"size": 639, "text": "He ate with such unusual deliberation, on this exciting morning, that they found themselves at the end of their repast when, apparently, he had but made a beginning. \u201cNow you mustn't wait for me at all,\u201d he announced to them then. \u201cI'm a little tired this morning--and I think I'd just like to lie around and smoke, and perhaps read one of your novels. But you two must get your things on and lose no time in getting out. This is the very best time of day, you know--for Alpine scenery. I'd hate to have you miss any of it.\u201d Under his kindly if somewhat strenuous insistence, they went to their rooms to prepare for an immediate excursion."}, {"size": 621, "text": "He was so anxious to have them see all there was to be seen that, when Julia returned, properly cloaked and befurred, and stood waiting at the window, he scolded a little. \u201cWhat on earth is that boy doing?\u201d he exclaimed, with a latent snarl in his tone which was novel to her ear. \u201cHe'll keep you here till noon!\u201d \u201cHe's shaving, I think. He won't be long,\u201d she replied, with great gentleness. After a moment's pause, she turned from the window and came gayly forward. \u201cOh, I forgot: I was going to feed the birds. There are several of them out there now.\u201d As she spoke, she busily broke up some of the rolls on the table."}, {"size": 684, "text": "Her face was bright with the pleasure of the thought. \u201cIf you don't much mind, Julia,\u201d her uncle began, with almost pleading intonations, \u201cI rather think I wouldn't feed those birds. The rule is there before our eyes, you know--and it's always been my idea that if you're at a hotel it's the correct thing to abide by its rules. It's just an idea of mine--and I daresay, if you think about it, you'll feel the same way.\u201d The girl freed the last remaining bread-crumb from her gloves. \u201cWhy, of course, uncle,\u201d she said, with promptitude. Although there was no hint of protest in her tone or manner, he felt impelled to soften still further this solitary demonstration of his authority."}, {"size": 678, "text": "\u201cYou see I've been all round the world, my little girl,\u201d he explained, haltingly, \u201cand when a man's done that, and knocked about everywhere, he's apt to get finicking and notional about trifles every once in a while.\u201d \u201cYou're less so than anybody I ever knew,\u201d she generously interposed. \u201cOh, no I'm not. You don't know me well enough yet; that's what's the matter. And you see, Julia--another thing just because you saw that lady throwing out bread, that aint a very good reason why you should do it. You don't know what kind of a person she may be. Girls have got to be so frightfully careful about all that sort of thing.\u201d Julia offered a constrained little laugh in comment."}, {"size": 705, "text": "\u201cOh, you don't know how careful I can be,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you're not annoyed?\u201d he entreated her--and for answer she came behind him, and rested an arm on his shoulder, and patted it. He stroked her hand with his own. \u201cThat's something like the nicest niece in the world!\u201d he exclaimed, with fervour. When at last she and her brother had gone, he made short work of his breakfast, and drank his coffee at a gulp. A restless activity suddenly informed his movements. He lit a cigar, and began pacing up and down the room, biting his lips in preoccupation as he went. After a little, he opened a window, and ventured cautiously as far out on the balcony as was necessary to obtain a view of the street below."}, {"size": 602, "text": "Eventually, he identified his nephew and niece among the pedestrians beneath him, and he kept them in sight till, after more than one tiresome halt at a shop window, they disappeared round a bend in the road. Then he turned and came back into the room with the buoyant air of a man whose affairs are prospering. He smiled genially to himself as he gathered from the table in one capacious hand all the pieces of bread his beloved niece had broken up, and advanced again to the open window. Waiting here till one of the dingy gulls moving aimlessly about was headed toward him, he tossed out a fragment."}, {"size": 608, "text": "The bird dashed at it with a scream, and on the instant the whole squawking flock were on wing. He suffered the hubbub to proceed unappeased for a little while he kept a watchful though furtive eye on that balcony to the left, below. Unhappily he could not get out far enough to see whether the inner curtains of its window were drawn. He threw another bit of bread, and then looked at his watch. It was a few minutes past nine. Surely people travelling to see scenery would be up by this hour. The strategy of issuing just enough bread to keep the feathered concourse in motion commended itself to his mind."}, {"size": 648, "text": "As a precautionary measure, he took all the rolls remaining on the table, and put them in the drawer of a desk by the window. It even occurred to him to ring for more bread, but upon consideration that seemed too daring. The waiter would be sufficiently surprised at the party's appetites as it was. Half an hour later, his plan of campaign suddenly yielded a victory. Lady Cressage appeared on her balcony, clad in some charming sort of morning gown, and bareheaded. She had nothing in her hands, and seemed indifferent to the birds, but when Thorpe flung forth a handful of fragments into the centre of their whirling flock, she looked up at him."}, {"size": 622, "text": "It was the anxious instant, and he ventured upon what he hoped was a decorous compromise between a bow and a look of recognition. She was in no haste to answer either. He could see rather than hear that she said something to her invisible companion within, the while she glanced serenely in the general direction of his balcony. It seemed to him that the answer to her remark, whatever it was, must have exerted a direct influence upon his destiny, for Lady Cressage all at once focussed her vague regard upon him, and nodded with a reasonably gracious smile. \u201cIt's wonderful luck to find you here,\u201d he called down to her."}, {"size": 623, "text": "Having played their part, he wished now that the birds were at Jericho. Their obstreperous racket made conversation very difficult. Apparently she made him an answer, but he could catch nothing of it. \u201cI'm here with my niece and nephew,\u201d he shouted down. \u201cI don't hear what you say. May I come down and pay my respects--later on? What is your number, and when may I come?\u201d These questions, as he flashed them in review through his mind, seemed to be all right from the most exacting social point of view. Doubtless it was equally all right that, before replying, she should consult her companion, as she did at some length."}, {"size": 793, "text": "Then she replied--and he had no difficulty now in hearing her above the birds--that it would be very nice of him to come, say, in an hour's time. She told him the number--and then almost abruptly went in. Thorpe, during this hour that ensued, smoked with volcanic energy. He tried to interest himself in one after another of half a dozen Tauchnitz novels his niece carried about, with a preposterous absence of success. He strove to arrange in some kind of sequence the things that he should say, when this momentous interview should begin, but he could think of nothing which did not sound silly. It would be all right, he argued to himself in the face of this present mental barrenness; he always talked well enough on the spur of the moment, when the time came--and still was not reassured."}, {"size": 700, "text": "He wondered if both ladies would be there to receive him, and decided that they would probably regard that as indispensable to the proprieties. In that case, their conversation would necessarily be of the most casual and general character. He would tell them a good deal about his niece, he foresaw. A man travelling about with a niece--and such a delightfully lady-like and engaging little niece--would take on some added interest and dignity, he perceived, in the eyes of ladies travelling alone. He essayed to estimate just how much they would probably like Julia. Of course he would say nothing about her mother and the book-shop; a vague allusion to a widowed sister would be ample on that head."}, {"size": 750, "text": "But there could be confident references to Cheltenham; he knew from what Julia had said that it suggested the most satisfactory social guarantees, if taken strictly by itself. And then so much would depend upon Julia herself! If she succeeded in striking up a friendship with them--ah, then everything would be all right. Perhaps they would take a fancy to Alfred too! He was a boy, of course, but conceivably the fact that he wanted to paint, and knew about pictures, would appeal to them. He seemed to have heard somewhere that artists were the very devil among women. At last the weary time of waiting had worn itself out, somehow, and, after a final polishing before his glass, he went down, and found his right corridor, and knocked at the door."}, {"size": 777, "text": "A pleasant voice bade him enter, and, hat and gloves in hand, he went in. As he had imagined, both ladies were present. He had not been prepared, however, for the fact that it was the American who played the part of hostess. It was she who received him, and invited him to sit down, and generally made him free of the apartment. When he shook hands with Lady Cressage, there was somehow an effect of the incidental in the ceremony, as if she were also a guest. Nothing could have been simpler or more pleasing than the little visit turned out to be. Miss Madden had suddenly grown tired of the snowless and dripping English winter, and had as promptly decided to come to Switzerland, where the drifts ought to be high enough, and the frosts searching enough, in all conscience."}, {"size": 708, "text": "They had selected Territet, because it was familiar to her, and because it was on the way to Martigny and Brieg, and she had had a notion of crossing either the Simplon or the St. Bernard in winter. As she found now, the St. Bernard was quite impracticable, but admittedly a post road was kept open over the Simplon. It was said now that she would not be allowed to proceed by this, but it often happened that she did the things that she was not allowed to do. The hotel-people at both Brieg and Berisal had written refusing to let their horses attempt the Simplon journey, and they were of course quite within their rights, but there were other horses in Switzerland. One surely could buy horses--and so on."}, {"size": 604, "text": "Thorpe also had his turn at autobiography. He told rather whimsically of his three months' experiences at the tail of the juvenile whirligigs, and his auditors listened to them with mild smiles. He ventured upon numerous glowing parentheses about Julia, and they at least did not say that they did not want to know her. They heard with politeness, too, what he could contrive to drag in about his artist-nephew, and said it must be very pleasant for him to have such nice company. At least Miss Madden said this: her companion, as he thought it over afterward, seemed hardly to have said anything at all."}, {"size": 750, "text": "She answered the few remarks which he found it possible to direct to her, but the responses took no hold upon his memory. He fancied that she was bored, or unhappy, or both. Finally, in the midst of commonplaces which, to his apprehension, were verging upon flatness, a bold inspiration disclosed itself--as splendid as the Dent du Midi revealing its glaciers above the mounting sunrise--in his brain. \u201cWe should all be charmed if you would come up and dine with us tonight,\u201d he said, under the abrupt impulsion of this idea. \u201cIt's been such an age since we wanderers have had the privilege of company at our table!\u201d The felicity of these phrases from his lips attracted his admiring attention, even while he waited in suspense for an answer to them."}, {"size": 475, "text": "The ladies exchanged a look. \u201cYes,\u201d said Miss Madden, after the slightest of pauses, \u201cwe shall be very happy.\u201d Shortly thereafter Thorpe took his leave, and went downstairs and out. He wandered about till luncheon time, observing the mountains across the lake from various standpoints, and, as it were, with new eyes. He was interested in them in a curious new fashion; they seemed to say things to him. His lip curled once at the conceit that he was one of the Alps himself."}, {"size": 754, "text": "IT did not happen until three days later that Thorpe's opportunity to speak alone with Lady Cressage came. In this brief period, the two parties seemed to have become fused in a remarkable intimacy. This was clearly due to the presence of the young people, and Thorpe congratulated himself many times each day upon the striking prescience he had shown in bringing them. Both the ladies unaffectedly liked Julia; so much so that they seemed unwilling to make any plans which did not include her. Then it was only a matter of course that where she went her brother should go--and a further logical step quite naturally brought in their willing uncle. If he had planned everything, and now was ordering everything, it could not have gone more to his liking."}, {"size": 658, "text": "Certain side speculations lent a savour to the satisfaction with which he viewed this state of affairs. He found many little signs to confirm the suspicion that the two ladies had been the readier to make much of Julia because they were not overkeen about each other's society. The bright, sweet-natured girl had come as a welcome diversion to a couple who in seclusion did battle with tendencies to yawn. He was not quite convinced, for that matter, that the American lady always went to that trouble. She seemed to his observation a wilful sort of person, who would not be restrained by small ordinary considerations from doing the things she wanted to do."}, {"size": 872, "text": "Her relations with her companion afforded him food for much thought. Without any overt demonstrations, she produced the effect of ordering Lady Cressage about. This, so far as it went, tended to prejudice him against her. On the other hand, however, she was so good to Julia, in a peculiarly frank and buoyant way which fascinated the girl, that he could not but like her. And she was very good to Alfred too. There was, indeed, he perceived, a great deal of individuality about the friendship which had sprung up between Miss Madden and his nephew. She was years his senior--he settled it with himself that the American could not be less than seven-and-twenty,--yet Alfred stole covert glances of admiration at her, and seemed to think of nothing but opportunities for being in her company as if--as if--Thorpe hardly liked to complete the comparison in his own thoughts."}, {"size": 727, "text": "Alfred, of course, said it was all on account of her wonderful hair; he rather went out of his way to dilate upon the enthusiasm her \u201ccolour scheme\u201d--whatever that might mean--excited in him as an artist. The uncle had moments of profound skepticism about this--moments when he uneasily wondered whether it was not going to be his duty to speak to the young man. For the most part, however, he extracted reassurance from Miss Madden's demeanour toward the lad. She knew, it seemed, a vast deal about pictures; at least she was able to talk a vast deal about them, and she did it in such a calmly dogmatic fashion, laying down the law always, that she put Alfred in the position of listening as a pupil might listen to a master."}, {"size": 771, "text": "The humility with which his nephew accepted this position annoyed Thorpe upon occasion, but he reasoned that it was a fault on the right side. Very likely it would help to keep the fact of the lady's seniority more clearly before the youngster's mind, and that would be so much gained. And these apprehensions, after all, were scarcely to be counted in the balance against the sense of achieved happiness with which these halcyon days kept Thorpe filled. The initiatory dinner had gone off perfectly. He could have wished, indeed, that Julia had a smarter frock, and more rings, when he saw the imposing costumes and jewelled throats and hands of his guests--but she was a young girl, by comparison, he reflected, and there could be no doubt that they found her charming."}, {"size": 621, "text": "As for Alfred, he was notably fine-looking in his evening-clothes--infinitely more like the son of a nobleman, the gratified uncle kept saying to himself, than that big dullard, the Honourable Balder. It filled him with a new pleasure to remember that Alfred had visiting cards presenting his name as D'Aubigny, which everybody of education knew was what the degenerate Dabney really stood for. The lad and his sister had united upon this excellent change long ago at Cheltenham, and oddly enough they had confessed it to their uncle, at the beginning of the trip, with a show of trepidation, as if they feared his anger."}, {"size": 612, "text": "With radiant gayety he had relieved their minds by showing them his card, with \u201cMr. Stormont Thorpe\u201d alone upon it. At the dinner table, in the proudest moment of his life, he had made himself prouder still by thinking how distinguished an appearance his and Alfred's cards would make together in the apartment below next day. But next day, the relations between the two parties had already become too informal for cards. Julia went down to see them; they came up to see Julia. Then they all went for a long walk, with luncheon at Vevey, and before evening Alfred was talking confidently of painting Miss Madden."}, {"size": 766, "text": "Next day they went by train to St. Maurice, and, returning after dark, dined without ceremony together. This third day--the weather still remaining bright--they had ascended by the funicular road to Glion, and walked on among the swarming luegers, up to Caux. Here, after luncheon, they had wandered about for a time, regarding the panorama of lake and mountains. Now, as the homeward descent began, chance led the two young people and Miss Madden on ahead. Thorpe found himself walking beside Lady Cressage. He had upon his arm her outer wrap, which she said she would put on presently. To look at the view he must glance past her face: the profile, under the graceful fur cap, was so enriched by glowing colour that it was, to his thought, as if she were blushing."}, {"size": 603, "text": "\u201cHow little I thought, a few months ago,\u201d he said, \u201cthat we should be mountaineering together!\u201d \u201cOh, no one knows a day ahead,\u201d she responded, vaguely. \u201cI had probably less notion of coming to Switzerland then than you had.\u201d \u201cThen you don't come regularly?\u201d \u201cI have never seen either Germany or Switzerland before. I have scarcely been out of England before.\u201d \u201cWhy now\u201d--he paused, to think briefly upon his words--\u201cI took it for granted you were showing Miss Madden around.\u201d \u201cIt 's quite the other way about,\u201d she answered, with a cold little laugh. \u201cIt is she who is showing me around. It is her tour."}, {"size": 627, "text": "I am the chaperone.\u201d Thorpe dwelt upon the word in his mind. He understood what it meant only in a way, but he was luminously clear as to the bitterness of the tone in which it had been uttered. \u201cNo--it didn't seem as if it were altogether--what I might call--YOUR tour,\u201d he ventured. They had seen much of each other these past few days, but it was still hard for him to make sure whether their freedom of intercourse had been enlarged. The slight shrug of the shoulders with which, in silence, she commented upon his remark, embarrassed him. For a moment he said nothing. He went on then with a renewed consciousness of risk."}, {"size": 692, "text": "\u201cYou mustn't be annoyed with me,\u201d he urged. \u201cI've been travelling with that dear little niece of mine and her brother, so long, that I've got into a habit of watching to notice if the faces I see round me are happy. And when they're not, then I have a kind of fatherly notion of interfering, and seeing what's wrong.\u201d She smiled faintly at this, but when he added, upon doubtful inspiration--\u201cBy the way, speaking of fathers, I didn't know at Hadlow that you were the daughter of one of my Directors\u201d--this smile froze upon the instant. \u201cThe Dent du Midi is more impressive from the hotel, don't you think?\u201d she remarked, \u201cthan it is from here.\u201d Upon consideration, he resolved to go forward."}, {"size": 678, "text": "\u201cI have taken a great interest in General Kervick,\u201d he said, almost defiantly. \u201cI am seeing to it that he has a comfortable income--an income suitable to a gentleman of his position--for the rest of his life.\u201d \u201cHe will be very glad of it,\u201d she remarked. \u201cBut I hoped that you would be glad of it too,\u201d he told her, bluntly. A curious sense of reliance upon his superiority in years had come to him. If he could make his air elderly and paternal enough, it seemed likely that she would defer to it. \u201cI'm talking to you as I would to my niece, you know,\u201d he added, plausibly. She turned her head to make a fleeting survey of his face, as if the point of view took her by surprise."}, {"size": 763, "text": "\u201cI don't understand,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are providing an income for my father, because you wish to speak to me like an uncle. Is that it?\u201d He laughed, somewhat disconsolately. \u201cNo--that isn't it,\u201d he said, and laughed again. \u201cI couldn't tell, you know, that you wouldn't want to talk about your father.\u201d \u201cWhy, there's no reason in the world for not talking of him,\u201d she made haste to declare. \u201cAnd if he's got something good in the City, I'm sure I'm as glad as anyone. He is the sort that ought always to have a good deal of money. I mean, it will bring out his more amiable qualities. He does not shine much in adversity--any more than I do.\u201d Thorpe felt keenly that there were fine things to be said here--but he had confidence in nothing that came to his tongue."}, {"size": 769, "text": "\u201cI've been a poor man all my life--till now,\u201d was his eventual remark. \u201cPlease don't tell me that you have been very happy in your poverty,\u201d she adjured him, with the dim flicker of a returning smile. \u201cVery likely there are people who are so constituted, but they are not my kind. I don't want to hear them tell about it. To me poverty is the horror--the unmentionable horror!\u201d \u201cThere never was a day that I didn't feel THAT!\u201d Thorpe put fervour into his voice. \u201cI was never reconciled to it for a minute. I never ceased swearing to myself that I'd pull myself out of it. And that's what makes me sort of soft-hearted now toward those--toward those who haven't pulled themselves out of it.\u201d \u201cYour niece says you are soft-hearted beyond example,\u201d remarked Lady Cressage."}, {"size": 617, "text": "\u201cWho could help being, to such a sweet little girl as she is?\u201d demanded the uncle, fondly. \u201cShe is very nice,\u201d said the other. \u201cIf one may say such a thing, I fancy these three months with her have had an appreciable effect upon you. I'm sure I note a difference.\u201d \u201cThat's just what I've been saying to myself!\u201d he told her. He was visibly delighted with this corroboration. \u201cI've been alone practically all my life. I had no friends to speak of--I had no fit company--I hadn't anything but the determination to climb out of the hole. Well, I've done that--and I've got among the kind of people that I naturally like."}, {"size": 781, "text": "But then there came the question of whether they would like me. I tell you frankly, that was what was worrying the heart out of me when I first met you. I like to be confessing it to you now--but you frightened me within an inch of my life. Well now, you see, I'm not scared of you at all. And of course it's because Julia's been putting me through a course of sprouts.\u201d The figure was lost upon Lady Cressage, but the spirit of the remarks seemed not unpleasant to her. \u201cI'm sure you're full of kindness,\u201d she said. \u201cYou must forget that I snapped at you--about papa.\u201d \u201cAll I remember about that is,\u201d he began, his eye lighting up with the thought that this time the opportunity should not pass unimproved, \u201cthat you said he didn't shine much in adversity---any more than you did."}, {"size": 684, "text": "Now on that last point I disagree with you, straight. There wouldn't be any place in which you wouldn't shine.\u201d \u201cIs that the way one talks to one's niece?\u201d she asked him, almost listlessly. \u201cSuch flattery must surely be bad for the young.\u201d Her words were sprightly enough, but her face had clouded over. She had no heart for the banter. \u201cAh\u201d--he half-groaned. \u201cI only wish I knew what was the right way to talk to you. The real thing is that I see you're unhappy--and that gets on my nerve--and I should like to ask you if there wasn't something I could do--and ask it in such a way that you'd have to admit there was--and I don't know enough to do it.\u201d He had a wan smile for thanks."}, {"size": 233, "text": "\u201cBut of course there is nothing,\u201d she replied, gently. \u201cOh, there must be!\u201d he insisted.

I must be going to London very soon--but she can stay here, or go to Egypt, or wherever she likes--and of course you would do everything, and have everything--whatever you liked, too.\u201d\u201cThe conversation is getting upon rather impossible grounds, I'm afraid,\u201d she said, and then bit her lips together.

And it is not so much that she has many thousands a year, and I only a few hundreds.

What I'm keen about is the way to use that fortune so that I will get the most out of it--the most happiness, I mean. The thing to do is to make up your mind carefully what it is that you want, and to put all your power and resolution into getting it--and the rest is easy enough.

Their uncle, they realized, must be concerned in large and probably venturesome enterprises; but it did not fit with their conception of his character that commercial anxieties should possess the power to upset him. And upset he undeniably was."}, {"size": 672, "text": "They traced his disturbance, in a general way, to the morning following the excursion up to Glion and Caux.

He professed not to be ill, but he was restless and preoccupied. He ate little, but smoked continuously, and drank spirits a good deal, which they had not seen him do before.

What things I've got to tell you!\u201d \u201cThere isn't any fire down here,\u201d she said, apologetically, as they edged their way through the restricted alley to the rear."}, {"size": 648, "text": "\u201cThe old fireplace took up too much room. Sometimes, in very sharp weather, I have an oil-stove in. Usually the gas warms it enough. You don't find it too cold--do you?--with your coat on?

What do you think we've done today?\u201d Louisa had never in her life seen her brother look so well as he did now, sprawling triumphantly upon the stool under the yellow gas-light.

He was all vigour, readiness, confidence, now. She deemed him almost handsome, this curious, changeable brother of hers, as he beat with his fist in a measured way upon the desk-top to emphasize his words, and fastened his commanding gaze upon her. \u201cWe took very nearly twenty thousand pounds to-day,\u201d he went on."}, {"size": 624, "text": "\u201cThis is the twenty-eighth of February. A fortnight ago today was the first settlement. I wasn't here, but Semple was--and the working of it is all in his hands. He kept as still as a mouse that first day. They had to deliver to us 26,000 shares, and they hadn't got one, but we didn't make any fuss. The point was, you see, not to let them dream that they were caught in a trap. We didn't even put the price up to par. They had to come to Semple, and say there didn't seem to be any shares obtainable just at the moment, and what would he carry them over at? That means, to let them postpone delivery for another fortnight."}, {"size": 845, "text": "He was as smooth as sweet-oil with them, and agreed to carry them over till today without any charge at all. But today it was a little different. The price was up ten shillings above par. That is to say, Semple arranged with a jobber, on the quiet, d'ye see? to offer thirty shillings for our one-pound shares. That offer fixed the making-up price. So then, when they were still without shares to-day, and had to be carried over again, they had to pay ten shillings' difference on each of twenty-six thousand shares, plus the difference between par and the prices they'd sold at. That makes within a few hundreds of 20,000 pounds in cash, for one day's haul. D'ye see?\u201d She nodded at him, expressively. Through previous talks she had really obtained an insight into the operation, and it interested her more than she would have cared to confess."}, {"size": 836, "text": "\u201cWell, then, we put that 20,000 pounds in our pockets,\u201d he proceeded with a steady glow in his eyes. \u201cA fortnight hence, that is March 14th, we ring the bell on them again, and they march up to the captain's office and settle a second time. Now what happens on the 14th? A jobber makes the price for Semple again, and that settles the new sum they have to pay us in differences. It is for us to say what that price shall be. We'll decide on that when the time comes. We most probably will just put it up another ten shillings, and so take in just a simple 13,000 pounds. It's best in the long run, I suppose, to go slow, with small rises like that, in order not to frighten anybody. So Semple says, at any rate.\u201d \u201cBut why not frighten them?\u201d Louisa asked. \u201cI thought you wanted to frighten them. You were full of that idea a while ago.\u201d"}, {"size": 612, "text": "He smiled genially. \u201cI've learned some new wrinkles since then. We'll frighten 'em stiff enough, before we're through with them. But at the start we just go easy. If they got word that there was a 'corner,' there would be a dead scare among the jobbers. They'd be afraid to sell or name a price for Rubber Consols unless they had the shares in hand. And there are other ways in which that would be a nuisance. Presently, of course, we shall liberate some few shares, so that there may be some actual dealings. Probably a certain number of the 5,000 which went to the general public will come into the market too."}, {"size": 623, "text": "But of course you see that all such shares will simply go through one operation before they come back to us. Some one of the fourteen men we are squeezing will snap them up and bring them straight to Semple, to get free from the fortnightly tax we are levying on them. In that way we shall eventually let out say half of these fourteen 'shorts,' or perhaps more than half.\u201d \u201cWhat do you want to do that for?\u201d The sister's grey eyes had caught a metallic gleam, as if from the talk about gold. \u201cWhy let anybody out? Why can't you go on taking their money for ever?\u201d Thorpe nodded complacently. \u201cYes--that's what I asked too."}, {"size": 670, "text": "It seemed to me the most natural thing, when you'd got 'em in the vise, to keep them there.

So, after a certain point, each one of the fourteen men whom we're squeezing must be dealt with on a different footing. We shall have to watch them all, and study their resources, as tipsters watch horses in the paddock. \u201cYou see, some of them can stand a loss of a hundred thousand pounds better than others could lose ten thousand."}, {"size": 613, "text": "All that we have to know.

See?\u201d \u201cIt's cruel, isn't it?\u201d she commented, calmly meditative, after a little pause. \u201cEverything in the City is cruel,\u201d he assured her with a light tone. \u201cAll speculative business is cruel. Take our case, for example."}, {"size": 669, "text": "I estimate in a rough way that these fourteen men will have to pay over to us, in differences and in final sales, say seven hundred thousand pounds--maybe eight hundred. Well, now, not one of those fellows ever earned a single sovereign of that money. They've taken the whole of it from others, and these others took it from others still, and so on almost indefinitely. There isn't a sovereign of it that hasn't been through twenty hands, or fifty for that matter, since the last man who had done some honest work for it parted company with it. Well--money like that belongs to those who are in possession of it, only so long as they are strong enough to hold on to it."}, {"size": 634, "text": "When someone stronger still comes along, he takes it away from them.

That's the way the City goes.\u201d Thorpe had concluded his philosophical remarks with ruminative slowness.

Their fingers are never still; they twist round and keep stirring like a lobster's feelers. But there aint any real strength in 'em. They get hold of most of the things that are going, because they're eternally on the move. It's their hellish industry and activity that gives them such a pull, and makes most people afraid of them. But when a hand like that takes them by the throat\u201d--he held up his right hand as he spoke, with the thick uncouth fingers and massive thumb arched menacingly in a powerful muscular tension--\u201cwhen THAT tightens round their neck, and they feel that the grip means business--my God!"}, {"size": 639, "text": "what good are they?\u201d He laughed contemptuously, and slapped the relaxed palm on the desk with a noise which made his sister start.

He had long grey hair--a kind of Quaker-looking man. He said he saw the name over the door, and he remembered your telling him your people were booksellers.

Of course, I never blamed you. I bought it with my eyes open, and you sold it in perfect good faith. I never doubted that at all. But it's not worth the paper it's written on--that's certain. It's that that busted me--that, and some other things.\u201d \u201cWell--well!\u201d said Thorpe, blankly.

The thing overwhelmed him. Once or twice he lifted his head and essayed to speak, but no speech came to his thin lips. He moistened them eventually with a long deliberate pull at his glass."}, {"size": 600, "text": "\u201cThis much ought to be understood, however,\u201d Thorpe resumed, reflecting upon his words as he went along. \u201cIf I'm to buy back a dead horse, like that, it's only reasonable that there should be conditions. I suppose you've seen by this time that even if this concession of ours was recognized by the Government there wouldn't be any money in it to speak of. I didn't realize that two years ago, any more than you did, but it's plain enough now. The trade has proved it. A property of rubber trees has no real value--so long as there's a wilderness of rubber trees all round that's everybody's property."}, {"size": 868, "text": "How can a man pay even the interest on his purchase money, supposing he's bought a rubber plantation, when he has to compete with people who've paid no purchase money at all, but just get out as much as they like from the free forest? You must know that that is so.\u201d Tavender nodded eloquently. \u201cOh yes, I know that is so. You can prove it by me.\u201d Thorpe grinned a little. \u201cAs it happens, that aint what I need to have you prove,\u201d he said, dryly. \u201cNow WE know that a rubber property is no good--but London doesn't know it. Everybody here thinks that it's a great business to own rubber trees. Why, man alive, do you know\u201d--the audacity of the example it had occurred to him to cite brought a gratified twinkle to his eyes as he went on--\u201cdo you know that a man here last year actually sold a rubber plantation for four hundred thousand pounds--two millions of dollars!"}, {"size": 649, "text": "Not in cash, of course, but in shares that he could do something with--and before he's done with it, I'm told, he's going to make twice that amount of money out of it. That'll show you what London is like.\u201d \u201cYes--I suppose they do those things,\u201d remarked Tavender, vaguely. \u201cWell--my point is that perhaps I can do something or other with this concession of yours here. I may even be able to get my money back on it. At any rate I'll take my chances on it--so that at least you shan't lose anything by it. Of course, if you'd rather try and put it on the market yourself, why go ahead!\u201d There was a wistful pathos in the way Tavender shook his head."}, {"size": 718, "text": "\u201cBig money doesn't mean anything to me any more,\u201d he said, wearily. \u201cI'm too old and I'm too tired. Why--four--five--yes, half a dozen times I've had enough money to last me comfortably all my life--and every time I've used it as bait to catch bigger money with, and lost it all. I don't do that any more! I've got something the matter with me internally that takes the nerve all out of me. The doctors don't agree about it, but whatever its name is I've got it for keeps. Probably I shan't live very long\u201d--Thorpe recalled that the old man had always taken a gloomy view of his health after the third glass--\u201cand if you want to pay me the nineteen thousand dollars, or whatever it is, why I shall say 'God bless you,'"}, {"size": 650, "text": "and be more than contented.\u201d \u201cOh, there's something more to it than that,\u201d observed Thorpe, with an added element of business-like briskness in his tone. \u201cIf I let you out in this way--something, of course, you could never have dreamed would happen--you must do some things for me. I should want you, for example, to go back to Mexico at once. Of course, I'd pay your expenses out. Or say, I'd give you a round four thousand pounds to cover that and some other things too. You wouldn't object to that, would you?\u201d The man who, two hours before, had confronted existence with the change of his last five-pound note in his pocket, did not hesitate now."}, {"size": 883, "text": "\u201cOh no, that would be all right,\u201d with reviving animation, he declared. He helped himself again from the cut-glass decanter. \u201cWhat would you want me to do there?\u201d \u201cOh, a report on the concession for a starter,\u201d Thorpe answered, with careful indifference. \u201cI suppose they still know your name as an authority. I could make that all right anyway. But one thing I ought to speak of--it might be rather important--I wouldn't like to have you mention to anybody that the concession has at any time been yours. That might tend to weaken the value of your report, don't you see? Let it be supposed that the concession has been my property from the start. You catch my point, don't you? There never was any such thing as a transfer of it to you. It's always been mine!\u201d Tavender gave his benefactor a purblind sort of wink. \u201cAlways belonged to you? Why of course it did,\u201d he said cheerfully."}, {"size": 642, "text": "The other breathed a cautious prolonged sigh of relief \u201cYou'd better light a fresh one, hadn't you?\u201d he asked, observing with a kind of contemptuous tolerance the old man's efforts to ignite a cigar which had more than once unrolled like a carpenter's shaving in his unaccustomed fingers, and was now shapelessly defiant of both draught and suction. Tavender laughed to himself silently as he took a new cigar, and puffed at the match held by his companion. The air of innocence and long-suffering meekness was falling rapidly away from him. He put his shabby boots out confidently to the fender and made gestures with his glass as he talked."}, {"size": 752, "text": "\u201cMy mistake,\u201d he declared, in insistent tones, \u201cwas in not turning down science thirty years ago and going in bodily for business. Then I should have made my pile as you seem to have done. But I tried to do something of both. Half the year I was assaying crushings, or running a level, or analyzing sugars, for a salary, and the other half I was trying to do a gamble with that salary on the strength of what I'd learned. You can't ring the bell that way. You've got to be either a pig or a pup. You can't do both. Now, for instance, if I'd come to London when you did, and brought my money with me instead of buying your concession with it----\u201d \u201cWhy, what good do you suppose you would have done?\u201d Thorpe interrupted him with good-natured brusqueness."}, {"size": 607, "text": "\u201cYou'd have had it taken from you in a fortnight! Why, man, do you know what London is? You'd have had no more chance here than a naked nigger in a swamp-full of alligators.\u201d \u201cYou seem to have hit it off,\u201d the other objected. \u201cThis is as fine a house as I was ever in.\u201d \u201cWith me it's different,\u201d Thorpe replied, carelessly. \u201cI have the talent for money-making. I'm a man in armour. The 'gators can't bite me, nor yet the rattle-snakes.\u201d \u201cYes--men are made up differently,\u201d Tavender assented, with philosophical gravity. Then he lurched gently in the over-large chair, and fixed an intent gaze upon his host."}, {"size": 683, "text": "\u201cWhat did you make your money in?\u201d he demanded, not with entire distinctness of enunciation. \u201cIt wasn't rubber, was it?\u201d Thorpe shook his head. \u201cThere's no money in rubber. I'm entirely in finance--on the Stock Exchange--dealing in differences,\u201d he replied, with a serious face. The explanation seemed wholly acceptable to Tavender. He mused upon it placidly for a time, with his reverend head pillowed askew against the corner of the chair. Then he let his cigar drop, and closed his eyes. The master of the house bent forward, and noiselessly helped himself to another glass of whiskey and water. Then, sinking back again, he eyed his odd guest meditatively as he sipped the drink."}, {"size": 785, "text": "He said to himself that in all the miraculous run of luck which the year had brought him, this was the most extraordinary manifestation of the lot. It had been so easy to ignore the existence of this tiresome and fatuous old man, so long as he was in remote Mexico, that he had practically forgotten him. But he should not soon forget the frightened shock with which he had learned of his presence in London, that afternoon. For a minute or two, there in his sister's book-shop, it had seemed as if he were falling through the air--as if the substantial earth had crumbled away from under him. But then his nerve had returned to him, his resourceful brain had reasserted itself. With ready shrewdness he had gone out, and met the emergency, and made it the servant of his own purposes."}, {"size": 648, "text": "He could be glad now, unreservedly glad, that Tavender had come to London, that things had turned out as they had. In truth, he stood now for the first time on solid ground. When he thought of it, now, the risk he had been running all these months gave him a little sinking of the heart. Upon reflection, the performance of having sold the same property first to Tavender in Mexico and then to the Rubber Consols Company in London might be subject to injurious comment, or worse. The fact that it was not a real property to begin with had no place in his thoughts. It was a concession--and concessions were immemorially worth what they would fetch."}, {"size": 600, "text": "But the other thing might have been so awkward--and now it was all right! For an hour and more, till the fire burnt itself out and the guest's snoring became too active a nuisance, Thorpe sat lost in this congratulatory reverie. Then he rose, and sharply shaking Tavender into a semblance of consciousness, led him upstairs and put him to bed. Three days later he personally saw Tavender off at Waterloo station by the steamer-train, en route for Southampton and New York. The old man was in childlike good spirits, looking more ecclesiastical than ever in the new clothes he had been enabled to buy."}, {"size": 865, "text": "He visibly purred with content whenever his dim eyes caught sight of the new valise and steamer trunk, which belonged to him, on the busy platform. \u201cYou've been very kind to me, Thorpe,\u201d he said more than once, as they stood together beside the open door of the compartment. \u201cI was never so hospitably treated before in my life. Your attention to me has been wonderful. I call you a true friend.\u201d \u201cOh, that's all right! Glad to do it,\u201d replied the other, lightly. In truth he had not let Tavender stray once out of his sight during those three days. He had dragged him tirelessly about London, showing him the sights from South Kensington Museum to the Tower, shopping with him, resting in old taverns with him, breakfasting, lunching, aud dining with him--in the indefatigable resolution that he should strike up no dangerous gossiping acquaintance with strangers."}, {"size": 672, "text": "The task had been tiresome in the extreme--but it had been very well worth while. \u201cOne thing I'm rather sorry about,\u201d Tavender remarked, in apologetic parenthesis--\u201cI ought to have gone down and seen that brother-in-law of mine in Kent. He's been very good to me, and I'm not treating him very well. I wrote to tell him I was coming--but since then I haven't had a minute to myself. However, I can write to him and explain how it happened. And probably I'll be over again sometime.\u201d \u201cWhy, of course,\u201d said Thorpe, absently. The allusion to the brother-in-law in Kent had escaped his notice, so intent was he upon a new congeries of projects taking vague shape in his mind."}, {"size": 898, "text": "\u201cThink of yourself as my man out there,\u201d he said now, slowly, following the clue of his thoughts. \u201cThere may be big things to do. Write to me as often as you can. Tell me everything that's going on. Money will be no object to me--you can have as much as you like--if things turn up out there that are worth taking up. But mind you say nothing about me--or any connection you've ever had with me. You'll get a letter from the Secretary of a Company and the Chairman asking for a report on a certain property, and naming a fee. You simply make a good report--on its merits. You say nothing about anything else--about me, or the history of the concession, or its validity, or anything. I mustn't be alluded to in any way. You quite understand that?\u201d \u201cTrust me!\u201d said the old man, and wrung his benefactor's hand. It was indeed with a trustful eye that Thorpe watched the train draw out of the station."}, {"size": 607, "text": "THE week following the August Bank Holiday is very rarely indeed a busy or anxious time in the City. In the ordinary course of things, it serves as the easy-going prelude--with but casual and inattentive visits eastward, and with only the most careless glances through the financial papers--to the halcyon period of the real vacation. Men come to the City during this week, it is true, but their thoughts are elsewhere--on the moors, on the blue sea, on the glacier or the fiord, or the pleasant German pine forests.To the great mass of City people; this August in question began in a normal enough fashion."}, {"size": 676, "text": "To one little group of operators, however, and to the widening circle of brokers, bankers, and other men of affairs whose interests were more or less involved with those of this group, it was a season of keen perturbation. A combat of an extraordinary character was going on--a combat which threatened to develop into a massacre. Even to the operators who, unhappily for themselves, were principals in this fight, it was a struggle in the dark. They knew little about it, beyond the grimly-patent fact that they were battling for their very lives. The outer ring of their friends and supporters and dependents knew still less, though their rage and fears were perhaps greater."}, {"size": 647, "text": "The \u201cpress\u201d seemed to know nothing at all. This unnatural silence of the City's mouthpieces, usually so resoundingly clamorous upon the one side and the other when a duel is in progress, gave a sinister aspect to the thing. The papers had been gagged and blindfolded for the occasion. This in itself was of baleful significance. It was not a duel which they had been bribed to ignore. It was an assassination. Outwardly there was nothing to see, save the unofficial, bald statement that on August 1st, the latest of twelve fortnightly settlements in this stock, Rubber Consols had been bid for, and carried over, at 15 pounds for one-pound shares."}, {"size": 627, "text": "The information concerned the public at large not at all. Nobody knew of any friend or neighbour who was fortunate enough to possess some of these shares. Readers here and there, noting the figures, must have said to themselves that certain lucky people were coining money, but very little happened to be printed as to the identity of these people. Stray notes were beginning to appear in the personal columns of the afternoon papers about a \u201cRubber King\u201d of the name of Thorpe, but the modern exploitation of the world's four corners makes so many \u201ckings\u201d that the name had not, as yet, familiarized itself to the popular eye."}, {"size": 603, "text": "City men, who hear more than they read, knew in a general way about this \u201cRubber King.\u201d He was an outsider who had come in, and was obviously filling his pockets; but it was a comforting rule that outsiders who did this always got their pockets emptied for them again in the long run. There seemed nothing about Thorpe to suggest that he would prove an exception to the rule. He was investing his winnings with great freedom, so the City understood, and his office was besieged daily by promoters and touts. They could clean out his strong-box faster than the profits of his Rubber corner could fill it."}, {"size": 657, "text": "To know such a man, however, could not but be useful, and they made furtive notes of his number in Austin Friars on their cuffs, after conversation had drifted from him to other topics. As to the Rubber corner itself, the Stock Exchange as a whole was apathetic. When some of the sufferers ventured cautious hints about the possibility of official intervention on their behalf, they were laughed at by those who did not turn away in cold silence. Of the fourteen men who had originally been caught in the net drawn tight by Thorpe and Semple, all the conspicuous ones belonged to the class of \u201cwreckers,\u201d a class which does not endear itself to Capel Court."}, {"size": 638, "text": "Both Rostocker and Aronson, who, it was said, were worst hit, were men of great wealth, but they had systematically amassed these fortunes by strangling in their cradles weak enterprises, and by undermining and toppling over other enterprises which would not have been weak if they had been given a legitimate chance to live. Their system was legal enough, in the eyes alike of the law and of the Stock Exchange rules. They had an undoubted right to mark out their prey and pursue it, and bring it down, and feed to the bone upon it. But the exercise of this right did not make them beloved by the begetters and sponsors of their victims."}, {"size": 761, "text": "When word first went round, on the last day of February, that a lamb had unexpectedly turned upon these two practised and confident wolves, and had torn an ear from each of them, and driven them pell-mell into a \u201ccorner,\u201d it was received on all sides with a gratified smile. Later, by fortnightly stages, the story grew at once more tragic and more satisfactory. Not only Rostocker and Aronson, but a dozen others were in the cul de sac guarded by this surprising and bloody-minded lamb. Most of the names were well-known as those of \u201cwreckers.\u201d In this category belonged Blaustein, Ganz, Rothfoere, Lewis, Ascher, and Mendel, and if Harding, Carpenter, and Vesey could not be so confidently classified, at least their misfortune excited no particular sympathy."}, {"size": 696, "text": "Two other names mentioned, those of Norfell and Pinney, were practically unknown. There was some surprise, however, at the statement that the old and respected and extremely conservative firm of Fromentin Bros. was entangled in the thing.

Who could have expected to find them caught among the \u201cshorts\u201d in Mexican rubber? It was Mexico, wasn't it, that these Rubber Consols purported to be connected with? Thorpe's Company, upon its commercial merits, had not been considered at all by the gentlemen of the Stock Exchange, at the time of its flotation."}, {"size": 724, "text": "Men vaguely and with difficulty recalled the fact of its prospectus, when the \u201ccorner\u201d in its shares was first talked about. They looked it up in their lists and files, later on, but its terms said nothing to them. Nobody discussed the value of the assets owned by this Company, or the probability of its paying a dividend--even when the price bid for its shares was making the most sensational upward leaps. How Thorpe stood with his shareholders, or whether he had any genuine shareholders behind him at all, was seen by the keen eyes of Capel Court to be beside the question. Very likely it was a queer affair, if the truth were known--but at least it had substance enough in it to be giving the \u201cwreckers\u201d a lively time."}, {"size": 643, "text": "By the end of July it was understood that the fight was better worth watching than anything that had been seen in a long time. The only trouble was that there was so little to see. The papers said nothing. The sufferers were the reverse of garrulous. The little red Scotchman, Semple, who was the visible avenging sword of the \u201ccorner,\u201d was more imperturbably silent than anybody else. His fellow-members in the \u201cHouse\u201d watched him now, however, with a new respect. They discovered unsuspected elements of power in his thin, tight mouth, in the direct, cold glances of his brown-grey eyes, in the very way he carried his head and wore his hat."}, {"size": 750, "text": "He came to be pointed out, and nodded about behind his back, more than anyone else in the \u201cHouse,\u201d and important men sought his acquaintance, with an awkward show of civility, who were notorious for their rude exclusiveness. It might be, of course, that his \u201ccorner\u201d would break under him at any fortnightly settlement, but already he had carried it much further than such things often went, and the planning of the coup had been beyond doubt Napoleonic. Had this small sandy Scot planned it, or was he merely the weapon in Thorpe's hand? Both views had their supporters on the Exchange, but after the wrench of August 1st, when with an abrupt eighty-shilling rise the price of Rubber Consols stood at 15 pounds, and it was to be computed that Semple"}, {"size": 695, "text": "had received on that single day nearly 75,000 pounds in differences and \u201cbackwardation,\u201d a story was set afloat which gave Thorpe the undivided credit of the invention. It was related as coming from his own lips that he had schemed it all out to be revenged upon a group of Jewish operators, against whom he had a grievance. In confirmation of this tale, it was pointed out that, of the seven men still held pinned in the fatal \u201ccorner,\u201d six were Jews--and this did, upon first glance, look significant. But then it was objected, upon reflection, that Blaustein and Ascher had both been permitted to make their escape, and this hardly justified the theory of an implacable anti-Semitic vendetta."}, {"size": 716, "text": "The objection seemed reasonable, but it was met in turn by the point that Blaustein and Ascher had been bled white, as Bismarck's phrase went, before they were released, whereas the five Christians had been liberated with relatively moderate fines. Upon the whole, a certain odour of the Judenhetze clung thereafter about the \u201ccorner\u201d in Rubber Consols. On an afternoon of the following week, Mr. Stormont Thorpe was alone in the Board Room of the offices in Austin Friars. He had risen from the great roller-topped desk over between the windows, and walked now with a lethargic, tired step to and fro before the empty fireplace, yawning more than once, and stretching out his arms in the supreme gesture of fatigue."}, {"size": 744, "text": "After a dozen listless rounds, something occurred to him. He moved with a certain directness of purpose to the cabinet in the corner, unlocked it, and poured out for himself a tumbler of brandy and soda. He drank it without a pause, then turned again, and began pacing up and down as before, his hands clasped behind him, his head bent in thought. The intervening six months had effected visible changes in the outer man. One noted most readily that the face had grown fuller in its lower parts, and was far less browned than formerly. The large, heavy countenance, with its square jaws masked now under increased flesh, its beginnings of a double-chin, and its slightly flabby effect of pallor, was no longer lacking in individual distinction."}, {"size": 728, "text": "It was palpably the visage of a dictator. The moustache had been cut down to military brevity, and the line of mouth below it was eloquent of rough power. The steady grey eyes, seemingly smaller yet more conspicuous than before, revealed in their glance new elements of secretiveness, of strategy supported by abundant and confident personal force. The man himself seemed scarcely to have grown stouter. He held himself more compactly, as it were; seemed more the master of all his physical expressions. He was dressed like a magnate who was also a person of taste. There was a flower in the lapel of his well-shaped frock-coat, and the rustle of his starched and spotless white waistcoat murmured pleasantly of refined toilets."}, {"size": 724, "text": "\u201cThe Marquis of Chaldon--and a gentleman, with him.\u201d The announcement, from a clerk who had noiselessly opened the door, imposed itself with decorum upon Thorpe's reverie. \u201cWho is the gentleman with him?\u201d Thorpe began austerely to ask, after an instant's hesitation. But this briefest of delays had brought the callers into plain view behind the clerk, and with a slight gesture the master assented to their entrance. This large apartment was no longer called the Board Room by anybody. By tacit processes, it had become Mr. Thorpe's room. Not even the titular Chairman of the Company, the renowned and eminent Lord Chaldon, ex-Ambassador and ex-Viceroy, entered this chamber now with any assumption of proprietorship in it."}, {"size": 621, "text": "No hint of a recollection that there were such things as the Company and the Board, or that he was nominally the head of both, expressed itself in his Lordship's demeanour as he advanced, his hand a little extended.

He bowed in a foreign fashion, and uttered some words which Thorpe, though he recognized them as English in intent, failed to follow.

Seating himself in the revolving chair at the desk itself, he put the tips of his fingers together, and looked this gentleman with the Continental name and experience in the face. \u201cIs there something you wish me to do?\u201d he asked, passively facilitating the opening of conversation. \u201cAh, my God! 'Something'!\u201d--repeated the other, with a fluttering gesture of his hands over his thin, pointed knees--\u201ceverything, Mr. Thorpe!\u201d \u201cThat's a tolerably large order, isn't it?\u201d Thorpe asked, calmly, moving a slow, inscrutable glance from one to the other of his callers."}, {"size": 632, "text": "\u201cI could ask for nothing that would be a greater personal favour--and kindness\u201d--Lord Chaldon interposed.

Great names were mentioned in the course of this dissertation--mentioned with the authoritative ease of one who dined with princes and prime ministers--and Thorpe felt that he shared in the distinction of this familiarity with the august.

At the end he nodded, and, with a lumbering movement, altered his position in his chair. The fixed idea of despoiling Rostocker, Aronson, Ganz, Rothfoere, Lewis, and Mendel of their last sixpence had been in no wise affected by this entertaining homily.

While you're here, we might as well go into the subject of the Company. Our annual meeting is pretty nearly due--but I think it would be better to have it postponed. You see, this extraordinary development of dealing in our shares on the Stock Exchange has occupied my entire attention. There has been no time for arranging the machinery of operations on our property in Mexico. It's still there; it's all right. But for the time being, the operations in London are so much more important.

You see, when the Company was started, it was impossible to foresee that this dealing in our ordinary shares would swamp everything else.

You hold two thousand shares--only by accident they're the wrong kind of shares. Very well: I'll make them the right kind of shares.

His tone was extremely gracious, but he displayed none of the enthusiastic excitement which Thorpe perceived now that he had looked for. The equanimity of Marquises, who were also ex-Ambassadors, was evidently a deeper-rooted affair than he had supposed. This elderly and urbane diplomat took a gift of thirty thousand pounds as he might have accepted a superior cigar.

And I put that letter in my pocket, right here on the left side--and it's there now, for that matter\u201d--he put his hand to his breast, as if under the impulse to verify his words by the production of the missive, and then stopped and flushed.

There was indeed a kind of approving interest in their joint regard, which he had not experienced before."}, {"size": 698, "text": "\u201cI had it in my pocket,\u201d he resumed, with an accession of mellow emotion in his voice, \u201cand none of the callers ever got my thoughts very far from that letter. And one of these was an old man--a French banker who must be seventy years old, but dyes his hair a kind of purple black--and it seems that his nephew had got the firm into a terrible kind of scrape, selling 2,000 of my shares when he hadn't got them to sell and couldn't get them--and the old man came to beg me to let him out at present market figures. He got Lord Chaldon--he's my Chairman, you know--to bring him, and introduce him as his friend, and plead for him--but I don't think all that, by itself, would have budged me an atom."}, {"size": 695, "text": "But then the old man told how he was just able to scrape together money enough to buy the shares he needed, at the ruling price, and he happened to mention that his niece's marriage portion would have to be sacrificed.

The girl' s portion, I wormed it out of him, was ten thousand...and I struck that much off the figure that I allowed him to buy his shares, and save his firm, for....It was all the letter that did it, mind you!\u201d He concluded the halting narrative amid a marked silence.

Miss Madden welcomed the diversion by rising with ostentatious vigour. \u201cI will take myself out,\u201d she declared, with cheerful promptness leading the way. Lady Cressage took the arm Thorpe offered her, and gave no token of comprehending that her wrist was being caressingly pressed against his side as they moved along. At the little table shining in the centre of the dark, cool dining-room, talk moved idly about among general topics.

What is uncommon in you--at least that is my reading--is something which according to circumstances may be nice, or very much the other way about. It's something which stands quite apart from standards of morals or ethics or the ordinary emotions.

You have the kind of organization in which, within a second, without any warning or reason, a passing whim may have worked itself up into an imperative law--something you must obey.\u201d The man smiled and nodded approvingly: \u201cYou've got me down fine,\u201d he said. \u201cI talk with a good deal of confidence,\u201d she went on, with a cheerless, ruminative little laugh, \u201cbecause it is my own organization that I am describing, too."}, {"size": 663, "text": "The difference is that I was allowed to exploit my capacity for mischief very early.

And here's the point: if it had happened that somebody else chanced to produce an opposite impression upon you, you would have been capable of taking $50,000 away from him with just as light a heart.\u201d Thorpe's face beamed with repressed amusement."}, {"size": 618, "text": "\u201cAs a matter of fact it was that kind of case I was going to mention.

He had several photographs of what was called the lodge, but looked like something between a mansion and a baronial castle, on the mantel of the Board Room.

I want you to come right bang out, now, and have a drink with me.\u201d \u201cI was thinking of something of the sort myself,\u201d the big man replied. \u201cI'll get my hat, and be with you in a minute.\u201d In the next room he relinquished his countenance to a frown of fierce perplexity. More than a minute passed in this scowling preoccupation."}, {"size": 780, "text": "Then his face lightened with the relief of an idea, and he stepped confidently back into the parlour. \u201cCome along,\u201d he said, jovially. \u201cWe'll have a drink downstairs, and then we'll drive up to Hanover Square and see if we can't find a friend of mine at his club.\u201d In the office below he stopped long enough to secure a considerable roll of bank-notes in exchange for a cheque. A little later, a hansom deposited the couple at the door of the Asian Club, and Thorpe, in the outer hallway of this institution, clicked his teeth in satisfaction at the news that General Kervick was on the premises. The General, having been found by a boy and brought down, extended to his guests a hospitality which was none the less urbane for the evidences of surprise with which it was seasoned."}, {"size": 817, "text": "He concealed so indifferently his inability to account for Tavender, that the anxious Thorpe grew annoyed with him, but happily Tavender's perceptions were less subtle. He gazed about him in his dim-eyed way with childlike interest, and babbled cheerfully over his liquor. He had not been inside a London club before, and his glimpse of the reading-room, where, isolated, purple-faced, retired old Empire-makers sat snorting in the silence, their gouty feet propped up on foot-rests, their white brows scowling over the pages of French novels, particularly impressed him. It was a new and halcyon vision of the way to spend one's declining years. And the big smoking-room--where the leather cushions were so low and so soft, and the connection between the bells and the waiters was so efficient--that was even better."}, {"size": 650, "text": "Thorpe presently made an excuse for taking Kervick apart. \u201cI brought this old jackass here for a purpose,\u201d he said in low, gravely mandatory tones. \u201cHe thinks he's got an appointment at 5:30 this afternoon--but he's wrong. He hasn't. He's not going to have any appointment at all--for a long time yet. I want you to get him drunk, there where he sits, and then take him away with you, and get him drunker still, and then take a train with him somewhere--any station but Charing Cross or that line--and I don't care where you land with him--Scotland or Ireland or France--whatever you like. Here's some money for you--and you can write to me for more."}, {"size": 698, "text": "I don't care what you say to him--make up any yarn you like--only keep him pacified, and keep him away from London, and don't let a living soul talk to him--till I give you the word. You'll let me know where you are. I'll get away now--and mind, General, a good deal depends on the way you please me in this thing.\u201d The soldier's richly-florid face and intent, bulging blue eyes expressed vivid comprehension. He nodded with eloquence as he slipped the notes into his trousers pocket. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he murmured with martial brevity, from under his white, tight moustache. With only a vague word or two of meaningless explanation to Tavender, Thorpe took his departure, and walked back to the hotel."}, {"size": 709, "text": "From what he had learned and surmised, it was not difficult to put the pieces of the puzzle together. This ridiculous old fool, he remembered now, had reproached himself, when he was in England before, for his uncivil neglect of his brother-in-law. By some absurd chance, this damned brother-in-law happened to be Gafferson. It was clear enough that, when he returned to Mexico, Tavender had written to Gafferson, explaining the unexpected pressure of business which had taken up all his time in England. Probably he had been idiot enough to relate what he of course regarded as the most wonderful piece of good news--how the worthless concession he had been deluded into buying had been bought back from him."}, {"size": 733, "text": "As likely as not he had even identified the concession, and given Thorpe's name as that of the man who had first impoverished and then mysteriously enriched him. At all events, he had clearly mentioned that he had a commission to report upon the Rubber Consols property, and had said enough else to create the impression that there were criminal secrets connected with its sale to the London Company. The rest was easy. Gafferson, knowing Lord Plowden's relation to the Company, had shown him Tavender's letter. Lord Plowden, meditating upon it, had seen a way to be nasty--and had vindictively plunged into it. He had brought Tavender from Mexico to London, to use him as a weapon. All this was as obvious as the nose on one's face."}, {"size": 673, "text": "But a weapon for what? Thorpe, as this question put itself in his mind, halted before a shop-window full of soft-hued silk fabrics, to muse upon an answer. The delicate tints and surfaces of what was before his eyes seemed somehow to connect themselves with the subject. Plowden himself was delicately-tinted and refined of texture. Vindictiveness was too plain and coarse an emotion to sway such a complicated and polished organism. He reasoned it out, as he stood with lack-lustre gaze before the plate-glass front, aloof among a throng of eager and talkative women who pressed around him--that Plowden would not have spent his money on a mere impulse of mischief-making."}, {"size": 716, "text": "He would be counting upon something more tangible than revenge--something that could be counted and weighed and converted into a bank-balance. He smiled when he reached this conclusion--greatly surprising and confusing a matronly lady into whose correct face he chanced to be looking at the instant--and turning slowly, continued his walk. At the office of the hotel, he much regretted not having driven instead, for he learned that Semple had twice telephoned from the City for him. It was late in the afternoon--he noted with satisfaction that the clock showed it to be already past the hour of the Tavender-Gafferson appointment,--but he had Semple's office called up, upon the chance that someone might be there."}, {"size": 658, "text": "The clerk had not consumed more than ten minutes in the preliminaries of finding out that no one was there--Thorpe meanwhile passing savage comments to the other clerks about the British official conception of the telephone as an instrument of discipline and humiliation--when Semple himself appeared in the doorway. The Broker gave an exclamation of relief at seeing Thorpe, and then, apparently indifferent to the display of excitement he was exhibiting, drew him aside. \u201cCome somewhere where we can talk,\u201d he whispered nervously. Thorpe had never seen the little Scotchman in such a flurry. \u201cWe'll go up to my rooms,\u201d he said, and led the way to the lift."}, {"size": 716, "text": "Upstairs, Semple bolted the door of the sitting-room behind them, and satisfied himself that there was no one in the adjoining bedroom. Then, unburdening himself with another sigh, he tossed aside his hat, and looked keenly up at the big man. \u201cThere's the devil to pay,\u201d he said briefly. Thorpe had a fleeting pride in the lethargic, composed front he was able to present. \u201cAll right,\u201d he said with forced placidity. \u201cIf he's got to be paid, we'll pay him.\u201d He continued to smile a little. \u201cIt's nah joke,\u201d the other hastened to warn him. \u201cI have it from two different quarters. An application has been made to the Stock Exchange Committee, this afternoon, to intervene and stop our business, on the ground of fraud."}, {"size": 642, "text": "It comes verra straight to me.\u201d Thorpe regarded his Broker contemplatively. The news fitted with precision into what he had previously known; it was rendered altogether harmless by the precautions he had already taken. \u201cWell, keep your hair on,\u201d he said, quietly. \u201cIf there were fifty applications, they wouldn't matter the worth of that soda-water cork. Won't you have a drink?\u201d Semple, upon reflection, said he would. The unmoved equipoise of the big man visibly reassured him. He sipped at his bubbling tumbler and smacked his thin lips. \u201cMan, I've had an awful fright,\u201d he said at last, in the tone of one whose ease of mind is returning."}, {"size": 716, "text": "\u201cI gave you credit for more nerve,\u201d observed the other, eyeing him in not unkindly fashion over his glass. \u201cYou've been so plumb full of sand all the while--I didn't think you'd weaken now. Why, we're within two days of home, now--and for you to get rattled at this late hour--you ought to be ashamed of yourself.\u201d The Scotchman looked into the bottom of his glass, as he turned it thoughtfully round. \u201cI'm relieved to see the way you take it,\u201d he said, after a pause. With increased hesitation he went dryly on: \u201cI've never enquired minutely into the circumstances of the flotation. It has not seemed to be my business to do so, and upon advice I may say that the Committee would not hold that such was my business."}, {"size": 625, "text": "My position is quite clear, upon that point.\u201d \u201cOh, perfectly,\u201d Thorpe assented. \u201cIt couldn't possibly be any of your business--either then, or now.\u201d He gave a significant touch of emphasis to these last two words. \u201cPrecisely,\u201d said Semple, with a glance of swift comprehension. \u201cYou must not think I am asking any intrusive questions. If you tell me that--that there is no ground for uneasiness--I am verra pleased indeed to accept the assurance. That is ample information for my purposes.\u201d \u201cYou can take it from me,\u201d Thorpe told him. He picked up a red book from a side table, and turned over its pages with his thick thumb."}, {"size": 615, "text": "\u201cThis is what Rule 59 says,\u201d he went on: \u201c'NO APPLICATION WHICH HAS FOR ITS OBJECT TO ANNUL ANY BARGAIN IN THE STOCK EXCHANGE SHALL BE ENTERTAINED BY THE COMMITTEE, UNLESS UPON A SPECIFIC ALLEGATION OF FRAUD OR WILFUL MISREPRESENTATION.' Shall be entertained, d'ye see? They can't even consider anything of the sort, because it says 'specific,' and I tell you plainly that anything 'specific' is entirely out of the question.\u201d The Broker lifted his sandy brows in momentary apprehension. \u201cIf it turns upon the precise definition of a word,\u201d he remarked, doubtingly. \u201cAh, yes,--but it doesn't,\u201d Thorpe reassured him."}, {"size": 630, "text": "\u201cSee here--I'll tell you something. You're not asking any questions. That's as it should be. And I'm not forcing information upon you which you don't need in your business. That's as it should be, too. But in between these two, there's a certain margin of facts that there's no harm in your knowing. A scheme to blackmail me is on foot. It's rather a fool-scheme, if you ask me, but it might have been a nuisance if it had been sprung on us unawares. It happened, however, that I twigged this scheme about two hours ago. It was the damnedest bit of luck you ever heard of----\u201d \u201cYou don't have luck,\u201d put in Semple, appreciatively."}, {"size": 864, "text": "\u201cOther men have luck. You have something else--I don't give it a name.\u201d Thorpe smiled upon him, and went on. \u201cI twigged it, anyway. I went out, and I drove the biggest kind of spike through that fool-scheme--plumb through its heart. Tomorrow a certain man will come to me--oh, I could almost tell you the kind of neck-tie he'll wear--and he'll put up his bluff to me, and I'll hear him out--and then--then I'll let the floor drop out from under him.\u201d \u201cAye!\u201d said Semple, with relish. \u201cStay and dine with me tonight,\u201d Thorpe impulsively suggested, \u201cand we'll go to some Music Hall afterward. There's a knock-about pantomime outfit at the Canterbury--Martinetti I think the name is--that's damned good. You get plenty of laugh, and no tiresome blab to listen to. The older I get, the more I think of people that keep their mouths shut.\u201d \u201cAye,\u201d observed Semple again."}, {"size": 601, "text": "IN the Board Room, next day, Thorpe awaited the coming of Lord Plowden with the serene confidence of a prophet who not only knows that he is inspired, but has had an illicit glimpse into the workings of the machinery of events.He sat motionless at his desk, like a big spider for who time has no meaning. Before him lay two newspapers, folded so as to expose paragraphs heavily indicated by blue pencil-marks. They were not financial journals, and for that reason it was improbable that he would have seen these paragraphs, if the Secretary of the Company had not marked them, and brought them to him."}, {"size": 637, "text": "That official had been vastly more fluttered by them than he found it possible to be. In slightly-varying language, these two items embedded in so-called money articles reported the rumour that a charge of fraud had arisen in connection with the Rubber Consols corner, and that sensational disclosures were believed to be impending. Thorpe looked with a dulled, abstracted eye at these papers, lying on the desk, and especially at the blue pencil-lines upon them, as he pondered many things. Their statement, thus scattered broadcast to the public, seemed at once to introduce a new element into the situation, and to leave it unchanged."}, {"size": 619, "text": "That influence of some sort had been exerted to get this story into these papers, it did not occur to him for an instant to doubt. To his view, all things that were put into papers were put there for a purpose--it would express his notion more clearly, perhaps, to say for a price. Of the methods of Fleet Street, he was profoundly ignorant, but his impressions of them were all cynical. Upon reflection, however, it seemed unlikely to him that Lord Plowden had secured the insertion of these rumours. So far as Thorpe could fathom that nobleman's game, its aims would not be served by premature publicity of this kind."}, {"size": 650, "text": "Gradually, the outlines of a more probable combination took shape in his thoughts. There were left in the grip of the \u201ccorner\u201d now only two victims,--Rostocker and Aronson. They owed this invidious differentiation to a number of causes: they had been the chief sellers of stock, being between them responsible for the delivery of 8,500 Rubber Consols shares, which they could not get; they were men of larger fortune than the other \u201cshorts,\u201d and therefore could with safety be squeezed longest; what was fortunate for him under the circumstances, they were the two men against whom Thorpe's personal grudge seemed able to maintain itself most easily."}, {"size": 740, "text": "For these reasons, they had already been mulcted in differences to the extent of, in round numbers, 165,000 pounds. On the morrow, the twelfth of September, it was Thorpe's plan to allow them to buy in the shares they needed, at 22 or 23 pounds per share--which would take from them nearly 200,000 pounds more. He had satisfied himself that they could, and would if necessary, pay this enormous ransom for their final escape from the \u201ccorner.\u201d Partly because it was not so certain that they could pay more, partly because he was satiated with spoils and tired of the strain of the business, he had decided to permit this escape. He realized now, however, that they on their side had planned to escape without paying any final ransom at all."}, {"size": 827, "text": "That was clearly the meaning of these paragraphs, and of the representations which had yesterday been made to the Stock Exchange Committee. He had additional knowledge today of the character of these representations. Nothing definite had been alleged, but some of the members of the Committee had been informally notified, so Semple had this morning learned, that a specific charge of fraud, supported by unanswerable proof, was to be brought against the Rubber Consols management on the morrow. Thorpe reasoned out now, step by step, what that meant. Lord Plowden had sought out Rostocker and Aronson, and had told them that he had it in his power ignominiously to break the \u201ccorner.\u201d He could hardly have told them the exact nature of his power, because until he should have seen Tavender he did not himself know what it was."}, {"size": 710, "text": "But he had given them to understand that he could prove fraud, and they, scenting in this the chance of saving 200,000 pounds, and seeing that time was so terribly short, had hastened to the Committeemen with this vague declaration that, on the morrow, they could prove--they did not precisely know what. Yes--plainly enough--that was what had happened. And it would be these two Jew \u201cwreckers,\u201d eager to invest their speculative notification to the Committee with as much of an air of formality as possible, who had caused the allusions to it to be published in these papers. Thorpe's lustreless eye suddenly twinkled with mirth as he reached this conclusion; his heavy face brightened into a grin of delight."}, {"size": 717, "text": "A vision of Lord Plowden's absurd predicament rose vividly before him, and he chuckled aloud at it. It seemed only the most natural thing in the world that, at this instant, a clerk should open the door and nod with meaning to the master. The visitor whom he had warned the people in the outer office he expected, had arrived. Thorpe was still laughing to himself when Lord Plowden entered. \u201cHallo! How d'ye do!\u201d he called out to him from where he sat at his desk. The hilarity of the manner into which he had been betrayed, upon the instant surprised and rather confused him. He had not been altogether clear as to how he should receive Plowden, but certainly a warm joviality had not occurred to him as appropriate."}, {"size": 679, "text": "The nobleman was even more taken aback. He stared momentarily at the big man's beaming mask, and then, with nervous awkwardness, executed a series of changes in his own facial expression and demeanour. He flushed red, opened his lips to say \u201cAh!\u201d and then twisted them into a doubting and seemingly painful smile. He looked with very bright-eyed intentness at Thorpe, as he advanced, and somewhat spasmodically put out his hand. It occurred to Thorpe not to see this hand. \u201cHow are you!\u201d he repeated in a more mechanical voice, and withdrew his smile. Lord Plowden fidgeted on his feet for a brief, embarrassed interval before the desk, and then dropped into a chair at its side."}, {"size": 645, "text": "With a deliberate effort at nonchalance, he crossed his legs, and caressed the ankle on his knee with a careless hand. \u201cAnything new?\u201d he asked. Thorpe lolled back in his arm-chair. \u201cI'm going to be able to get away in a few days' time,\u201d he said, indifferently. \u201cI expect to finally wind up the business on the Stock Exchange tomorrow.\u201d \u201cAh--yes,\u201d commented Plowden, vacantly. He seemed to be searching after thoughts which had wandered astray. \u201cYes--of course.\u201d \u201cYes--of course,\u201d Thorpe said after him, with a latent touch of significance. The other looked up quickly, then glanced away again. \u201cIt's all going as you expected, is it?\u201d he asked."}, {"size": 664, "text": "\u201cBetter than I expected,\u201d Thorpe told him, energetically. \u201cMuch better than anybody expected.\u201d \u201cHah!\u201d said Plowden. After a moment's reflection he went on hesitatingly: \u201cI didn't know. I saw something in one of the papers this morning,--one of the money articles,--which spoke as if there were some doubt about the result. That's why I called.\u201d \u201cWell--it's damned good of you to come round, and show such a friendly interest.\u201d Thorpe's voice seemed candid enough, but there was an enigmatic something in his glance which aroused the other's distrust. \u201cI'm afraid you don't take very much stock in the 'friendly interest,'\u201d he said, with a constrained little laugh."}, {"size": 732, "text": "\u201cI'm not taking stock in anything new just now,\u201d replied Thorpe, lending himself lazily to the other's metaphor. \u201cI'm loaded up to the gunnels already.\u201d A minute of rather oppressive silence ensued. Then Plowden ventured upon an opening. \u201cAll the same, it WAS with an idea of,--perhaps being of use to you,--that I came here,\u201d he affirmed. \u201cIn what way?\u201d Thorpe put the query almost listlessly. Lord Plowden turned his hands and let his dark eyes sparkle in a gesture of amiable uncertainty. \u201cThat depended upon what was needed. I got the impression that you were in trouble--the paper spoke as if there were no doubt of it--and I imagined that quite probably you would be glad to talk with me about it.\u201d \u201cQuite right,\u201d said Thorpe."}, {"size": 677, "text": "\u201cSo I should.\u201d This comprehensive assurance seemed not, however, to facilitate conversation. The nobleman looked at the pattern of the sock on the ankle he was nursing, and knitted his brows in perplexity. \u201cWhat if the Committee of the Stock Exchange decide to interfere?\u201d he asked at last. \u201cOh, that would knock me sky-high,\u201d Thorpe admitted. \u201cApproximately, how much may one take 'sky-high' to mean?\u201d Thorpe appeared to calculate. \u201cAlmost anything up to a quarter of a million,\u201d he answered. \u201cHah!\u201d said Lord Plowden again. \u201cWell--I understand--I'm given to understand--that very likely that is what the Committee will decide.\u201d \u201cDoes it say that in the papers?\u201d asked Thorpe."}, {"size": 628, "text": "He essayed an effect of concern. \u201cWhere did you see that?\u201d \u201cI didn't see it,\u201d the other explained. \u201cIt--it came to me.\u201d \u201cGod!\u201d said Thorpe. \u201cThat'll be awful! But are you really in earnest? Is that what you hear? And does it come at all straight?\u201d Lord Plowden nodded portentously. \u201cAbsolutely straight,\u201d he said, with gravity. Thorpe, after a momentary stare of what looked like bewilderment, was seen to clutch at a straw. \u201cBut what was it you were saying?\u201d he demanded, with eagerness. \u201cYou talked about help--a minute ago. Did you mean it? Have you got a plan? Is there something that you can do?\u201d Plowden weighed his words."}, {"size": 872, "text": "\u201cIt would be necessary to have a very complete understanding,\u201d he remarked. \u201cWhatever you like,\u201d exclaimed the other. \u201cPardon me--it would have to be a good deal more definite than that,\u201d Plowden declared. \u201cA 'burnt child'--you know.\u201d The big man tapped musingly with his finger-nails on the desk. \u201cWe won't quarrel about that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what I'd like to know first,--you needn't give anything away that you don't want to,--but what's your plan? You say that they've got me in a hole, and that you can get me out.\u201d \u201cIn effect--yes.\u201d \u201cBut how do you know that I can't get myself out? What do you know about the whole thing anyway? Supposing I tell you that I laugh at it--that there's no more ground for raising the suspicion of fraud than there is for--for suspecting that you've got wings and can fly.\u201d \u201cI--I don't think you'll tell me that,\u201d said Plowden, placidly."}, {"size": 741, "text": "\u201cWell then, supposing I don't tell you that,\u201d the other resumed, argumentatively. \u201cSupposing I say instead that it can't be proved. If the Committee doesn't have proof NOW,--within twenty-one or twenty-two hours,--they can't do anything at all. Tomorrow is settling day. All along, I've said I would wind up the thing tomorrow. The market-price has been made for me by the jobbers yesterday and today. I'm all ready to end the whole business tomorrow--close it all out. And after that's done, what do I care about the Stock Exchange Committee? They can investigate and be damned! What could they do to me?\u201d \u201cI think a man can always be arrested and indicted, and sent to penal servitude,\u201d said Lord Plowden, with a certain solemnity of tone."}, {"size": 614, "text": "\u201cThere are even well-known instances of extradition.\u201d Thorpe buried his chin deep in his collar, and regarded his companion with a fixed gaze, in which the latter detected signs of trepidation. \u201cBut about the Committee--and tomorrow,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cWhat do you say about that? How can they act in that lightning fashion? And even if proofs could be got, how do you suppose they are to be got on the drop of the hat, at a minute's notice?\u201d \u201cThe case is of sufficient importance to warrant a special meeting tomorrow morning,\u201d the other rejoined. \u201cOne hour's notice, posted in the House, is sufficient, I believe."}, {"size": 653, "text": "Any three members of the Committee can call such a meeting, and I understand that seven make a quorum.

Then he added, in tones of dejected resignation: \u201cWhen will you want it?\u201d \u201cAt the moment when the payments of Rostocker and Aronson are made to you, or to your bankers or agents,\u201d Lord Plowden replied, with prepared facility."}, {"size": 709, "text": "He had evidently given much thought to this part of the proceedings. \u201cAnd of course I shall expect you to draw up now an agreement to that effect.

Since we're dealing on this basis, there must be no doubt about the guarantee that you will perform your part of the contract.\u201d \u201cThe performance itself, since payment is conditional upon it--\u201d began Plowden, but the other interrupted him."}, {"size": 737, "text": "\u201cNo, I want something better than that. Here--give me your stamped paper.\u201d He took the bluish sheet, and, without hesitation, wrote several lines rapidly. \u201cHere--this is my promise,\u201d he said, \u201cto pay you 150,000 pounds, upon your satisfactory performance of a certain undertaking to be separately nominated in a document called 'A,' which we will jointly draw up and agree to and sign, and deposit wherever you like--for safe keeping. Now, if you'll sit here, and write out for me a similar thing--that in consideration of my promise of 150,000 pounds, you covenant to perform the undertaking to be nominated in the document 'A'--and so on.\u201d Lord Plowden treated as a matter of course the ready and business-like suggestion of the other."}, {"size": 664, "text": "Taking his place at the desk in turn, he wrote out what had been suggested. Thorpe touched a bell, and the clerk who came in perfunctorily attested the signatures upon both papers. Each principal folded and pocketed the pledge of the other. \u201cNow,\u201d said Thorpe, when he had seated himself again at the desk, \u201cwe are all right so far as protection against each other goes. If you don't mind, I will draw up a suggestion of what the separate document 'A' should set forth. If you don't like it, you can write one.\u201d He took more time to this task, frowning laboriously over the fresh sheet of foolscap, and screening from observation with his hand what he was writing."}, {"size": 842, "text": "Finally, the task seemed finished to his mind. He took up the paper, glanced through it once more, and handed it in silence to the other. In silence also, and with an expression of arrested attention, Lord Plowden read these lines: \u201cThe undertaking referred to in the two documents of even date, signed respectively by Lord Plowden and Stormont Thorpe, is to the effect that at some hour between eleven A.M. and three P.M. of September 12th, instant, Lord Plowden shall produce before a special meeting of the Committee of the Stock Exchange, the person of one Jerome P. Tavender, to explain to said Committee his share in the blackmailing scheme of which Lord Plowden, over his own signature, has furnished documentary evidence.\u201d The nobleman continued to look down at the paper, after the power to hold it without shaking had left his hand."}, {"size": 742, "text": "There came into his face, mingling with and vitiating its rich natural hues of health, a kind of grey shadow. It was as if clay was revealing itself beneath faded paint. He did not lift his eyes. Thorpe had been prepared to hail this consummation of his trick with boisterous and scornful mirth. Even while the victim was deciphering the fatal paper, he had restrained with impatience the desire to burst out into bitter laughter. But now there was something in the aspect of Plowden's collapse which seemed to forbid triumphant derision. He was taking his blow so like a gentleman,--ashen-pale and quivering, but clinging to a high-bred dignity of silence,--that the impulse to exhibit equally good manners possessed Thorpe upon the instant."}, {"size": 669, "text": "\u201cWell--you see how little business you've got, setting yourself to buck against a grown-up man.\u201d He offered the observation in the tone of the school-teacher, affectedly philosophical but secretly jubilant, who harangues a defeated and humiliated urchin upon his folly. \u201cOh, chuck it!\u201d growled Lord Plowden, staring still at the calamitous paper. Thorpe accepted in good part the intimation that silence was after all most decorous. He put his feet up on the corner of the desk, and tipping back his chair, surveyed the discomfited Viscount impassively. He forbore even to smile. \u201cSo this swine of a Tavender came straight to you!\u201d Lord Plowden had found words at last."}, {"size": 673, "text": "As he spoke, he lifted his face, and made a show of looking the other in the eye. \u201cOh, there are a hundred things in your own game, even, that you haven't an inkling of,\u201d Thorpe told him, lightly. \u201cI've been watching every move you've made, seeing further ahead in your own game than you did. Why, it was too easy! It was like playing draughts with a girl. I knew you would come today, for example. I told the people out there that I expected you.\u201d \u201cYes-s,\u201d said the other, with rueful bewilderment. \u201cYou seem to have been rather on the spot--I confess.\u201d \u201cOn the spot? All over the place!\u201d Thorpe lifted himself slightly in his chair, and put more animation into his voice."}, {"size": 651, "text": "\u201cIt's the mistake you people make!\u201d he declared oracularly. \u201cYou think that a man can come into the City without a penny, and form great combinations and carry through a great scheme, and wage a fight with the smartest set of scoundrels on the London Stock Exchange and beat 'em, and make for himself a big fortune--and still be a fool! You imagine that a man like that can be played with, and hoodwinked by amateurs like yourself. It's too ridiculous!\u201d The perception that apparently Thorpe bore little or no malice had begun to spread through Plowden's consciousness. It was almost more surprising to him than the revelation of his failure had been."}, {"size": 610, "text": "He accustomed himself to the thought gradually, and as he did so the courage crept back into his glance. He breathed more easily. \u201cYou are right!\u201d he admitted. It cost him nothing to give a maximum of fervid conviction to the tone of his words. The big brute's pride in his own brains and power was still his weakest point. \u201cYou are right! I did play the fool. And it was all the more stupid, because I was the first man in London to recognize the immense forces in you. I said to you at the very outset, 'You are going to go far. You are going to be a great man.' You remember that, don't you?\u201d Thorpe nodded."}, {"size": 668, "text": "\u201cYes--I remember it.\u201d The nobleman, upon reflection, drew a little silver box from his pocket, and extracted a match. \u201cDo you mind?\u201d he asked, and scarcely waiting for a token of reply, struck a flame upon the sole of his shoe, and applied it to the sheet of foolscap he still held in his hand. The two men watched it curl and blacken after it had been tossed in the grate, without a word. This incident had the effect of recalling to Thorpe the essentials of the situation. He had allowed the talk to drift to a point where it became almost affable. He sat upright with a sudden determination, and put his feet firmly on the floor, and knitted his brows in austerity."}, {"size": 672, "text": "\u201cIt was not only a dirty trick that you tried to play me,\u201d he said, in an altered, harsh tone, \u201cbut it was a fool-trick. That drunken old bum of a Tavender writes some lunatic nonsense or other to Gafferson, and he's a worse idiot even than Tavender is, and on the strength of what one of these clowns thinks he surmises the other clown means, you go and spend your money,--money I gave you, by the way,--in bringing Tavender over here. You do this on the double chance, we'll say, of using him against me for revenge and profit combined, or of peddling him to me for a still bigger profit. You see it's all at my fingers' ends.\u201d Lord Plowden nodded an unqualified assent."}, {"size": 680, "text": "\u201cWell then--Tavender arrives. What do you do? Are you at the wharf to meet him? Have you said to yourself: 'I've set out to fight one of the smartest and strongest men in England, and I've got to keep every atom of wits about me, and strain every nerve to the utmost, and watch every point of the game as a tiger watches a snake'? Not a bit of it! You snooze in bed, and you send Gafferson--Gafferson!--the mud-head of the earth! to meet your Tavender, and loaf about with him in London, and bring him down by a slow train to your place in the evening. My God! You've only got two clear days left to do the whole thing in--and you don't even come up to town to get ready for them!"}, {"size": 624, "text": "You send Gafferson--and he goes off to see a flower-show--Mother of Moses! think of it! a FLOWER-show!--and your Tavender aud I are left to take a stroll together, and talk over old times and arrange about new times, and so on, to our hearts' content. Really, it's too easy! You make me tired!\u201d The nobleman offered a wan, appealing shadow of a smile. \u201cI confess to a certain degree of weariness myself,\u201d he said, humbly. Thorpe looked at him in his old apathetic, leaden fashion for a little. \u201cI may tell you that if you HAD got hold of Tavender,\u201d he decided to tell him, \u201che shouldn't have been of the faintest use to you."}, {"size": 753, "text": "I know what it was that he wrote to Gafferson,--I couldn't understand it when he first told me, but afterwards I saw through it,--and it was merely a maudlin misapprehension of his. He'd got three or four things all mixed up together. You've never met your friend Tavender, I believe? You'd enjoy him at Hadlow House. He smells of rum a hundred yards off. What little brain he's got left is soaked in it. The first time I was ever camping with him, I had to lick him for drinking the methylated spirits we were using with our tin stove. Oh, you'd have liked him!\u201d \u201cEvidently,\u201d said Lord Plowden, upon reflection, \u201cit was all a most unfortunate and--ah--most deplorable mistake.\u201d With inspiration, he made bold to add: \u201cThe most amazing thing, though--to"}, {"size": 647, "text": "my mind--is that you don't seem--what shall I say?--particularly enraged with me about it.\u201d \u201cYes--that surprises me, too,\u201d Thorpe meditatively admitted. \u201cI was entitled to kill you--crush you to jelly. Any other man I would. But you,--I don't know,--I do funny things with you.\u201d \u201cI wish you would give me a drink, now--as one of them,\u201d Plowden ventured to suggest, with uneasy pleasantry. Thorpe smiled a little as he rose, and heavily moved across the room. He set out upon the big official table in the middle, that mockingly pretentious reminder of a Board which never met, a decanter and two glasses and some recumbent, round-bottomed bottles."}, {"size": 773, "text": "He handed one of these last to Plowden, as the latter strolled toward the table. \u201cYou know how to open these, don't you?\u201d he said, languidly. \u201cSomehow I never could manage it.\u201d The nobleman submissively took the bottle, and picked with awkwardness at its wire and cork, and all at once achieved a premature and not over-successful explosion. He wiped his dripping cuff in silence, when the tumblers were supplied. \u201cWell--here's better luck to you next time,\u201d Thorpe said, lifting his glass. The audacious irony of his words filled Plowden with an instant purpose. \u201cWhat on earth did you round on me in that way for, Thorpe--when I was here last?\u201d He put the question with bravery enough, but at sight of the other's unresponsive face grew suddenly timorous aud explanatory."}, {"size": 628, "text": "\u201cNo man was ever more astounded in the world than I was. To this day I'm as unable to account for it as a babe unborn. What conceivable thing had I done to you?\u201d Thorpe slowly thought of something that had not occurred to him before, and seized upon it with a certain satisfaction. \u201cThat day that you took me shooting,\u201d he said, with the tone of one finally exposing a long-nursed grievance, \u201cyou stayed in bed for hours after you knew I was up and waiting for you--and when we went out, you had a servant to carry a chair for you, but I--by God!--I had to stand up.\u201d \u201cHeavens above!\u201d ejaculated Plowden, in unfeigned amazement."}, {"size": 724, "text": "\u201cThese are little things--mere trifles,\u201d continued Thorpe, dogmatically, \u201cbut with men of my temper and make-up those are just the things that aggravate and rankle and hurt. Maybe it's foolish, but that's the kind of man I am. You ought to have had the intelligence to see that--and not let these stupid little things happen to annoy me. Why just think what you did. I was going to do God knows what for you--make your fortune and everything else,--and you didn't show consideration enough for me to get out of bed at a decent hour--much less see to it that I had a chair if you were going to have one.\u201d \u201cUpon my word, I can't tell how ashamed and sorry I am,\u201d Lord Plowden assured him, with fervent contrition in his voice."}, {"size": 826, "text": "\u201cWell, those are the things to guard against,\u201d said Thorpe, approaching a dismissal of the subject. \u201cPeople who show consideration for me; people who take pains to do the little pleasant things for me, and see that I'm not annoyed and worried by trifles--they're the people that I, on my side, do the big things for. I can be the best friend in the world, but only to those who show that they care for me, and do what they know I'll like. I don't want toadies about me, but I do want people who feel bound to me, and are as keen about me and my feelings and interests as they are about their own.\u201d \u201cIt is delightfully feudal--all this,\u201d commented the nobleman, smilingly addressing the remark to nobody in particular. Then he looked at Thorpe. \u201cLet me be one of them--one of the people you speak of,\u201d he said, with directness."}, {"size": 894, "text": "Thorpe returned his look with the good-natured beginnings of a grin. \u201cBut what would you be good for?\u201d he queried, in a bantering tone. \u201cPeople I have about me have to be of some use. They require to have heads on their shoulders. Why--just think what you've done. I don't mean so much about your letting Tavender slip through your fingers--although that was about the worst I ever heard of. But here in this room, at that desk there, you allowed me to bounce you into writing and signing a paper which you ought to have had your hand cut off rather than write, much less sign. You come here trying to work the most difficult and dangerous kind of a bluff,--knowing all the while that the witness you depended entirely upon had disappeared, you hadn't the remotest idea where,--and you actually let me lead you into giving me your signature to your own declaration that you are blackmailing me!"}, {"size": 622, "text": "Thinking it all over--you know--I can't see that you would be of much help to me in the City.\u201d Lord Plowden joined perforce in the laughter with which the big man enjoyed his own pleasantry. His mirth had some superficial signs of shamefacedness, but it was hopeful underneath. \u201cThe City!\u201d he echoed, with meaning. \u201cThat's the curse of it. What do I know about the City? What business have I in the City? As you said, I'm the amateur. A strong man like you can make me seem any kind of a ridiculous fool he likes, with the turn of his hand. I see that right enough. But what am I to do? I have to make a shot at something."}, {"size": 686, "text": "I'm so rotten poor!\u201d Thorpe had retired again behind the barrier of dull-eyed abstraction. He seemed not to have heard this appealing explanation. The other preserved silence in turn, and even made a pretence of looking at some pamphlets on the table, as a token of his boundless deference to the master's mood. \u201cI don't know. I'll see,\u201d the big man muttered at last, doubtfully. Lord Plowden felt warranted in taking an optimistic view of these vague words. \u201cIt's awfully good of you\u201d--he began, lamely, and then paused. \u201cI wonder,\u201d--he took up a new thought with a more solicitous tone,--\u201cI wonder if you would mind returning to me that idiotic paper I signed.\u201d Thorpe shook his head."}, {"size": 715, "text": "\u201cNot just now, at any rate,\u201d he said, still musingly. With his head bowed, he took a few restless steps. \u201cBut you are going to--to help me!\u201d the other remarked, with an air of confidence. He had taken up his hat, in response to the tacit warning of his companion's manner. Thorpe looked at him curiously, and hesitated over his answer. It was a surprising and almost unaccountable conclusion for the interview to have reached. He was in some vague way ashamed of himself, but he was explicitly and contemptuously ashamed for Plowden, and the impulse to say so was strong within him. This handsome young gentleman of title ought not to be escaping with this restored buoyancy of mien, and this complacency of spirit."}, {"size": 199, "text": "He had deserved to be punished with a heavy hand, and here he was blithely making certain of new benefits instead. \u201cI don't know--I'll see,\u201d Thorpe moodily repeated--and there was no more to be said."}, {"size": 770, "text": "IN the noon hour of the following day was enacted the brief final scene in the drama of the \u201cRubber Consols corner.\u201dFor long weeks, Mr. Stormont Thorpe had given much thought to this approaching climax of his great adventure--looking forward to it both as the crowning event of his life, and as the dawn of a new existence in some novel, enchanted world. It was to bring his triumph, and even more, his release. It was at once to crown him as a hero and chieftain among City men, and transfigure him into a being for whom all City things were an abomination. In his waking hours, the conflict between these aims did not specially force itself upon his attention: he mused upon, and spun fancies about, either one indifferently, and they seemed not at all irreconcilable."}, {"size": 629, "text": "But his dreams were full of warfare,--wearily saturated with strife, and endless endeavour to do things which could not be done, and panic-stricken terrors before the shadow of shapeless calamities,--until he dreaded to go to sleep. Then he discovered that an extra two glasses of whiskey-and-water would solve that particular difficulty, and send him into prompt, leaden slumber--but the early mornings remained as torturing as ever. In the twilight he awoke oppressed and sick at heart with gloom--and then dozed at intervals through fantastic new ordeals of anguish and shame and fear, till it was decently possible to get up."}, {"size": 642, "text": "Then, indeed, the big cold sponge on his head and spine scattered these foolish troubles like chaff, and restored to him his citizenship among the realities. He dressed with returning equanimity, and was almost cheerful by the time he thrust his razor into the hot water. Yet increasingly he was conscious of the wear and strain of it all, and increasingly the date, September twelfth, loomed before him with a portentous individuality of its own. This day grew to mean so much more to him than had all the other days of the dead years together that he woke in the darkness of its opening hours, and did not get satisfactorily to sleep again."}, {"size": 690, "text": "His vigil, however, was for the once free from grief. He drowsily awaited the morning in vague mental comfort; he had recurring haphazard indolent glimpses of a protecting fact standing guard just outside the portals of consciousness--the fact that the great day was here. He rose early, breakfasted well, and walked by the Embankment to the City, where at ten he had a few words with Semple, and afterward caused himself to be denied to ordinary callers. He paced up and down the Board Room for the better part of the ensuing two hours, luxuriating in the general sense of satisfaction in the proximity of the climax, rather than pretending to himself that he was thinking out its details."}, {"size": 679, "text": "He had provided in his plans of the day for a visit from Messrs. Rostocker and Aronson, which should constitute the dramatic finale of the \u201ccorner,\u201d and he looked forward to this meeting with a certain eagerness of expectation. Yet even here he thought broadly of the scene as a whole, and asked himself no questions about words and phrases. It seemed to be taken for granted in his mind that the scene itself would be theatrically impressive, even spectacular. In the event, this long-awaited culmination proved to be disappointingly flat and commonplace. It was over before Thorpe had said any considerable proportion of the things he saw afterward that he had intended to say."}, {"size": 644, "text": "The two men came as he had expected they would--and they bought their way out of the tragic \u201ccorner\u201d at precisely the price he had nominated in his mind. But hardly anything else went as he had dimly prefigured it. Mr. Rostocker was a yellow-haired man, and Mr. Aronson was as dark as a Moor, and no physical resemblance of features or form suggested itself to the comparing eye, yet Thorpe even now, when they stood brusquely silent before him, with their carefully-brushed hats pulled down over their eyes, stuck to it in his own mind that it was hard to tell them apart. To the end, there was something impersonal in his feeling toward them."}, {"size": 601, "text": "They, for their part, coldly abstained from exhibiting a sign of feeling about him, good, bad, or indifferent. It was the man with the fair hair and little curly flaxen beard who spoke: \u201cHow do you do! I understand that we can buy eight thousand five hundred Rubber Consols from you at 'twenty-three.'\u201d \u201cNo--twenty-five,\u201d replied Thorpe. The dark man spoke: \u201cThe jobbers' price is twenty-three.\u201d \u201cTo carry over--yes,\u201d Thorpe answered. \u201cBut to buy it is twenty-five.\u201d The two sons of the race which invented mental arithmetic exchanged an alert glance, and looked at the floor for an engrossed instant."}, {"size": 604, "text": "\u201cI don't mind telling you,\u201d Thorpe interposed upon their silence, \u201cI put on that extra two pounds because you got up that story about applying to the Stock Exchange Committee on a charge of fraud.\u201d \u201cWe didn't get up any story,\u201d said Rostocker, curtly. \u201cYou tried to plant it on us,\u201d Aronson declared. \u201cOne of your own Directors put it about. I thought it was a fake at the time.\u201d This view of the episode took Thorpe by surprise. As it seemed, in passing, to involve a compliment to his own strategic powers, he accepted it without comment. \u201cWell--it is twenty-five, anyway,\u201d he told them, with firmness."}, {"size": 610, "text": "\u201cTwenty-four,\u201d suggested Aronson, after another momentary pause. \u201cNot a shilling less than twenty-five,\u201d Thorpe insisted, with quiet doggedness. \u201cWe can always pay our creditors and let you whistle,\u201d Rostocker reminded him, laconically. \u201cYou can do anything you like,\u201d was the reply, \u201cexcept buy Rubber Consols under twenty-five. It doesn't matter a fig to me whether you go bankrupt or not. It would suit me as well to have you two 'hammered' as to take your money.\u201d Upon the spur of a sudden thought he drew out his watch. \u201cIn just two minutes' time to a tick, the price will be thirty.\u201d \u201cLet's be 'hammered'"}, {"size": 734, "text": "then!\u201d said Aronson to his companion, with simulated impulsiveness. Rostocker was the older and stronger man, and when at last he spoke it was with the decision of one in authority. \u201cIt is your game,\u201d he said, with grave imperturbability. \u201cEight thousand five hundred at twenty-five. Will you deliver at the Credit Lyonnais in half an hour?\u201d Thorpe nodded, impassively. Then a roving idea of genial impertinence brought a gleam to his eye. \u201cIf you should happen to want more Rubber Consols at any time,\u201d he said, with a tentative chuckle, \u201cI could probably let you have them at a reduced price.\u201d The two received the pleasantry without a smile, but to Thorpe's astonishment one of them seemed to discern something in it beside banter."}, {"size": 703, "text": "It was Rostocker who said: \u201cPerhaps we may make a deal with you,\u201d and apparently meant it. They went out at this, ignoring ceremony upon their exit as stolidly as they had done upon their entrance, and a moment later Thorpe called in the Secretary, and despatched a messenger to bring Semple from Capel Court. The formalities of this final transfer of shares had been dictated to the former, and he had gone off on the business, before the Broker arrived. Thorpe stood waiting near the door, and held out his hand with a dramatically significant gesture when the little Scotchman entered. \u201cPut her there!\u201d he exclaimed heartily, with an exuberant reversion to the slang of remote transatlantic bonhomie."}, {"size": 671, "text": "\u201cYeh've done it, then!\u201d said Semple, his sharp face softening with pleasure at the news. \u201cYeh've pulled it off at twenty-three!\u201d The other's big countenance yielded itself to a boyish grin. \u201cTwenty-FIVE!\u201d he said, and laughed aloud. \u201cAfter you left this morning, it kind o' occurred to me that I'd raise it a couple of pounds. I found I was madder about those pieces in the newspapers than I thought I was, and so I took an extra seventeen thousand pounds on that account.\u201d \u201cGod above!\u201d Semple ejaculated, with a satisfaction through which signs of an earlier fright were visible. \u201cIt was touch-and-go if you didn't lose it all by doing that!

Let's send out for some champagne!\u201d His finger was hovering over the bell, when the Broker's dissuading voice arrested it. \u201cNo, no!\u201d Semple urged. \u201cI wouldn't touch it. It's no fit drink for the daytime--and it's a scandal in an office. Your clerks will aye blab it about hither and yon, and nothing harms a man's reputation more in the City.\u201d \u201cOh, to hell with the City!\u201d cried Thorpe, joyously."}, {"size": 664, "text": "\u201cI'm never going to set foot in it again.

But all the same, I shall be better in every way for getting out of this hole. Thank God, I can get off to Scotland tomorrow. But I say, Semple, what's the matter with your visiting me at my place there? I'll give you the greatest shooting and fishing you ever heard of.\u201d The Broker was thinking of something else. \u201cWhat is to be the precise position of the Company, in the immediate future?\u201d he asked. \u201cCompany?

He said with angry decision to himself that he had never liked the work; that it had all been unpleasant and grinding drudgery, tolerable only as a means to an end; that now this end had been reached, he wanted never to lay eyes on the City again.

Perhaps if there were a particularly bad harvest, he would decline all over his estate to exact any rent whatever. Fancy what a noble sensation that would make! A Duke could do no more. It was very clear to him now that he desired to have children of his own,--say two at least, a son and a daughter, or perhaps a son and two daughters: two little girls would be company for each other. As he prefigured these new beings, the son was to exist chiefly for purposes of distinction and the dignity of heirship, and the paternal relations with him would be always somewhat formal, and, though affectionate, unexpansive."}, {"size": 706, "text": "But the little girls--they would put their arms round their father's neck, and walk out with him to see the pigs and the dogs, and be the darlings of his heart.

He stood in the centre of a chill solitude, staring stupidly at the coarse, soft paper. The premonition, then, had justified itself! Something had told him that the telegram was an evil thing. A vaguely superstitious consciousness of being in the presence of Fate laid hold upon him. His great day of triumph had its blood-stain. A victim had been needful--and to that end poor simple, silly old Tavender was a dead man. Thorpe could see him,--an embarrassing cadaver eyed by strangers who did not know what to do with it,--fatuous even in death."}, {"size": 793, "text": "A sudden rage at Kervick flamed up. He clearly had played the fool--clumsily over-plying the simpleton with drink till he had killed him. The shadow of murder indubitably hung over the thing. And then--the crass witlessness of telegraphing! Already, doubtless, the police of Edinborough were talking over the wires with Scotland Yard. A reference to a death in Edinborough, in a telegram from Newcastle--it was incredible that this should escape the eye of the authorities. Any minute might bring a detective through that door there--following into the Board Room with his implacable scent the clue of blood. Thorpe's fancy pictured this detective as a momentarily actual presence--tall, lean, cold-eyed, mysteriously calm and fatally wise, the omniscient terror of the magazine short-stories."}, {"size": 710, "text": "He turned faint and sick under a spasm of fright. The menace of enquiry became something more than a threat: he felt it, like the grip of a constable upon his arm. Everything would be mercilessly unravelled.

He would have his letter from Tavender to show to the detectives--and the Government's smart lawyers would ferret out the rest. The death of Tavender--they could hardly make him responsible for that; but it was the dramatic feature of this death which would inspire them all to dig up everything about the fraud."}, {"size": 638, "text": "It was this same sensational added element of the death, too, which would count with a jury.

But the Judges were fools, too; they were too conceited, too puffed up with vanity, to take the trouble to understand. He groaned aloud in a nightmare of helplessness.

With a shamed frown he straightened himself, and stood thus for a long minute, engrossed in the definite task of chasing these phantoms from his mind.

He had over half a million--with power and force and courage enough to do with it what he liked. He had fought luck undauntedly, unwearyingly, during all those years when his hands were empty.

By the time he reached the street, the memory of Tavender had become the merest shred of a myth.

An indolent and hazy compromise upon Pellesley Thorpe had drifted into use by perhaps a larger number.

For many miles seaward this pale front was a landmark.

It was a forest which at some time, no doubt, had extended without a break till it merged into that of Epping--leagues away to the south. The modern clearance and tillage, however, which separated it now from Epping had served as a curiously effective barrier--more baffling than the Romans and Angles in their turn had found the original wildwood. No stranger seemed ever to find his way into that broad, minutely-cultivated fertile plain which High Thorpe looked down upon."}, {"size": 713, "text": "No railway had pushed its cheapening course across it. Silent, embowered old country roads and lanes netted its expanse with hedgerows; red points of tiled roofs, distinguishable here and there in clusters among the darker greens of orchards, identified the scattered hamlets--all named in Domesday Book, all seemingly unchanged since. A grey square church-tower emerging from the rooks' nests; an ordered mass of foliage sheltering the distant gables and chimneys of some isolated house; the dim perception on occasion that a rustic waggon was in motion on some highway, crawling patiently like an insect--of this placid, inductive nature were all the added proofs of human occupation that the landscape offered."}, {"size": 788, "text": "Mr. Stormont Thorpe, on an afternoon of early October, yawned in the face of this landscape--and then idly wondered a little at the mood which had impelled him to do so. At the outset of his proprietorship he had bound himself, as by a point of honour, to regard this as the finest view from any gentleman's house in England. During the first few months his fidelity had been taxed a good deal, but these temptations and struggles lay now all happily behind him. He had satisfactorily assimilated the spirit of the vista, and blended it with his own. Its inertia, when one came to comprehend it, was undeniably magnificent, and long ago he had perceived within himself the growth of an answering repose, a responsive lethargy, which in its full development was also going to be very fine."}, {"size": 618, "text": "Practically all the land this side of the impalpable line where trees and houses began to fade into the background belonged to him; there were whole villages nestling half-concealed under its shrubberies which were his property.

Indeed, if one added the cost of the improvements which ought to be made, to the expenditure already laid out in renovations, it was questionable if for the next twenty years they would not represent a deficit on the income-sheet.

He had truly learned to love it. Yet now, as he strolled on the terrace with his first after-luncheon cigar, he unaccountably yawned at the thing he loved. Upon reflection, he had gone to bed rather earlier the previous evening than usual. He had not been drinking out of the ordinary; his liver seemed right enough. He was not conscious of being either tired or drowsy."}, {"size": 649, "text": "He looked again at the view with some fixity, and said to himself convincingly that nothing else in England could compare with it.

Since his home-coming to this splendid new home in the previous January, at the conclusion of a honeymoon spent in Algiers and Egypt, he had not been out of England.

The occasion of their return from the hot bustle of the metropolis to these cool home shades--in particular the minute in which, at a bend in the winding carriage-way down below, they had silently regarded together the spectacle uplifted before them, with the big, welcoming house, and the servants on the terrace--had a place of its own in his memory."}, {"size": 725, "text": "Edith had pressed his arm, as they sat side by side in the landau, on the instant compulsion of a feeling they had in common.

It was in the nature of the life he chose to lead that he should see a great deal of her, and think a great deal about her, and she bore both tests admirably. If there was a fault to be found, it was with himself for his inability to altogether understand her.

This was a look which he could not imagine himself discovering in his wife's eves. It was not conceivable to him that he should talk over her head. Her glance not only revealed an ample understanding of all he said, but suggested unused reserves of comprehension which he might not fathom.

It was always the easiest course to fall in with usage, but if he had any feelings on the subject, and preferred to have her insist on being called Mrs. Thorpe, she would meet his wishes with entire willingness.

Lady Cressage showed this to her husband, and talked again with candour on the subject. She said she had always rather regretted the decision they originally came to, and even now could wish that it might be altered, but that to effect a change in the face of this newspaper paragraph would seem servile--and in this as in most other things he agreed with her.

There was a meagre routine of formal calls kept in languid operation, Thorpe knew, but it was so much in the background that he never came in contact with it. His own notions of the part he ought to take in County affairs had undergone a silent and unnoted, yet almost sweeping, change. What little he saw of the gentry and strong local men with whom he would have to work, quietly undermined and dismantled all his ambitions in that direction.

He came to be upon nodding terms with most of the \u201ccarriage-people\u201d round about; some few he exchanged meaningless words with upon occasion, and understood that his wife also talked with, when it was unavoidable, but there his relationship to the County ended, and he was well pleased that it should be so.

It was always puzzling to him to reconcile her undoubted intellectual activity with the practical emptiness of the existence she professed to enjoy. In one direction, she had indeed a genuine outlet for her energies, which he could understand her regarding in the light of an occupation. She was crazier about flowers and plants than anybody he had ever heard of, and it had delighted him to make over to her, labelled jocosely as the bouquet-fund, a sum of money which, it seemed to him, might have paid for the hanging-gardens of Babylon."}, {"size": 736, "text": "It yielded in time--emerging slowly but steadily from a prodigious litter of cement and bricks and mortar and putty, under the hands of innumerable masons, carpenters, glaziers, plumbers, and nondescript subordinates, all of whom talked unwearyingly about nothing at all, and suffered no man to perform any part of his allotted task without suspending their own labours to watch him--an imposing long line of new greenhouses, more than twenty in number.

And even after they were filled to overflowing, Thorpe noted with joy that this interest seemed in no wise to flag. She spent hours every day under the glass, exchanging comments and theories with her gardeners, and even pulling things about with her own hands, and other hours she devoted almost as regularly to supervising the wholesale alterations that had been begun in the gardens outside."}, {"size": 728, "text": "There were to be new paths, new walls with a southern exposure, new potting sheds, new forcing pits, new everything--and in the evenings she often worked late over the maps and plans she drew for all this. Thorpe's mind found it difficult to grasp the idea that a lady of such notable qualities could be entirely satisfied by a career among seeds and bulbs and composts, but at least time brought no evidences of a decline in her horticultural zeal. Who knew? Perhaps it might go on indefinitely. As for himself, he had got on very well without any special inclination or hobby. He had not done any of the great things that a year ago it had seemed to him he would forthwith do--but his mind was serenely undisturbed by regrets."}, {"size": 746, "text": "He did not even remember with any distinctness what these things were that he had been going to do. The routine of life--as arranged and borne along by the wise and tactful experts who wore the livery of High Thorpe--was abundantly sufficient in itself. He slept well now in the morning hours, and though he remained still, by comparison, an early riser, the bath and the shaving and slow dressing under the hands of a valet consumed comfortably a good deal of time. Throughout the day he was under the almost constant observation of people who were calling him \u201cmaster\u201d in their minds, and watching to see how, in the smallest details of deportment, a \u201cmaster\u201d carried himself, and the consciousness of this alone amounted to a kind of vocation."}, {"size": 693, "text": "The house itself made demands upon him nearly as definite as those of the servants. It was a house of huge rooms, high ceilings, and grandiose fireplaces and stairways, which had seemed to him like a royal palace when he first beheld it, and still produced upon him an effect of undigestible largeness and strangeness. It was as a whole not so old as the agents had represented it, by some centuries, but it adapted itself as little to his preconceived notions of domesticity as if it had been built by Druids. The task of seeming to be at home in it had as many sides to it as there were minutes in the day--and oddly enough, Thorpe found in their study and observance a congenial occupation."}, {"size": 647, "text": "Whether he was reading in the library--where there was an admirable collection of books of worth--or walking over the home-farms, or driving in his smart stanhope with the coachman behind, or sitting in formal costume and dignity opposite his beautiful wife at the dinner-table, the sense of what was expected of him was there, steadying and restraining, like an atmospheric pressure. Thus far they had had few visitors, and had accepted no invitations to join house-parties elsewhere. They agreed without speaking about it that it was more their form to entertain than to be entertained, and certain people were coming to them later in the month."}, {"size": 867, "text": "These were quite wholly of Edith's set and selection, for Thorpe had no friends or acquaintances outside her circle for whose presence he had any desire--and among these prospective guests were a Duke and a Duchess. Once, such a fact would have excited Thorpe's imagination. He regarded it now as something appropriate under the circumstances, and gave it little further thought. His placid, satisfied life was not dependent upon the stir of guests coming and going, even though they were the great of the earth. He walked on his spacious terrace after luncheon--a tall, portly, well-groomed figure of a man, of relaxed, easy aspect, with his big cigar, and his panama hat, and his loose clothes of choice fabrics and exquisite tailoring--and said to himself that it was the finest view in England--and then, to his own surprise, caught himself in the act of yawning."}, {"size": 641, "text": "From under the silk curtains and awning of a window-doorway at the end of the terrace, his wife issued and came toward him. Her head was bare, and she had the grace and fresh beauty of a young girl in her simple light gown of some summery figured stuff. \u201cWhat do you say to going off somewhere--tomorrow if you like--travelling abroad?\u201d he called out, as she approached him. The idea, only a moment old in his mind, had grown to great proportions. \u201cHow can we?\u201d she asked, upon the briefest thought. \u201cTHEY are coming at the end of the week. This is Monday, and they arrive on the 12th--that's this Saturday.\u201d \u201cSo soon as that!\u201d he exclaimed."}, {"size": 616, "text": "\u201cI thought it was later. H-m! I don't know--I think perhaps I'll go up to London this evening. I'm by way of feeling restless all at once. Will you come up with me?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI can't think of anything in London that would be tolerable.\u201d He gave a vague little laugh. \u201cI shall probably hate it myself when I get there,\u201d he speculated. \u201cThere isn't anybody I want to see--there isn't anything I want to do. I don' t know--perhaps it might liven me up.\u201d Her face took on a look of enquiring gravity. \u201cAre you getting tired of it, then?\u201d She put the question gently, almost cautiously. He reflected a little."}, {"size": 687, "text": "\u201cWhy--no,\u201d he answered, as if reasoning to himself. \u201cOf course I'm not. This is what I've always wanted. It's my idea of life to a 't.' Only--I suppose everything needs a break in it now and then--if only for the comfort of getting back into the old rut again.\u201d \u201cThe rut--yes,\u201d she commented, musingly. \u201cApparently there's always a rut.\u201d Thorpe gave her the mystified yet uncomplaining glance she knew so well in his eyes. For once, the impulse to throw hidden things up into his range of view prevailed with her. \u201cDo you know,\u201d she said, with a confused half-smile at the novelty of her mood for elucidation, \u201cI fancied a rut was the one thing there could be no question about with you."}, {"size": 612, "text": "I had the notion that you were incapable of ruts--and conventional grooves. I thought you--as Carlyle puts it--I thought you were a man who had swallowed all the formulas.\u201d Thorpe looked down at his stomach doubtfully. \u201cI see what you mean,\u201d he said at last, but in a tone without any note of conviction. \u201cI doubt it,\u201d she told him, with light readiness--\u201cfor I don't see myself what I mean. I forget indeed what it was I said. And so you think you'll go up to town tonight?\u201d A sudden comprehension of what was slipping away from his grasp aroused him. \u201cNo--no,\u201d he urged her, \u201cdon't forget what it was you said!"}, {"size": 619, "text": "I wish you'd talk more with me about that. It was what I wanted to hear. You never tell me what you're really thinking about.\u201d She received the reproach with a mildly incredulous smile in her eyes. \u201cYes--I know--who was it used to scold me about that? Oh\u201d--she seemed suddenly reminded of something--\u201cI was forgetting to mention it. I have a letter from Celia Madden. She is back in England; she is coming to us Saturday, too.\u201d He put out his lips a trifle. \u201cThat's all right,\u201d he objected, \u201cbut what has it got to do with what we were talking about?\u201d \u201cTalking about?\u201d she queried, with a momentarily blank countenance."}, {"size": 763, "text": "\u201cOh, she used to bully me about my deceit, and treachery, and similar crimes. But I shall be immensely glad to see her. I always fight with her, but I think I like her better than any other woman alive.\u201d \u201cI like her too,\u201d Thorpe was impelled to say, with a kind of solemnity. \u201cShe reminds me of some of the happiest hours in my life.\u201d His wife, after a brief glance into his face, laughed pleasantly, if with a trace of flippancy. \u201cYou say nice things,\u201d she observed, slightly inclining her head. \u201cBut now that Celia is coming, it would be as well to have another man. It's such dreadfully short notice, though.\u201d \u201cI daresay your father could come, all right,\u201d Thorpe suggested. \u201cI'd rather have him than almost anyone else. Would you mind asking him--or shall I?\u201d"}, {"size": 637, "text": "An abrupt silence marked this introduction of a subject upon which the couple had differed openly. Thorpe, through processes unaccountable to himself, had passed from a vivid dislike of General Kervick to a habit of mind in which he thoroughly enjoyed having him about. The General had been twice to High Thorpe, and on each occasion had so prolonged his stay that, in retrospect, the period of his absence seemed inconsiderable. The master now, thinking upon it in this minute of silence, was conscious of having missed him greatly. He would not have been bored to the extremity of threatening to go to London, if Kervick had been here."}, {"size": 627, "text": "The General was a gentleman, and yet had the flexible adaptability of a retainer; he had been trained in discipline, and hence knew how to defer without becoming fulsome or familiar; he was a man of the world and knew an unlimited number of racy stories, and even if he repeated some of them unduly, they were better than no stories at all. And then, there was his matchless, unfailing patience in playing chess or backgammon or draughts or bezique, whatever he perceived that the master desired. \u201cIf you really wish it,\u201d Edith said at last, coldly. \u201cBut that's what I don't understand,\u201d Thorpe urged upon her with some vigour."}, {"size": 751, "text": "\u201cIf I like him, I don't see why his own daughter----\u201d \u201cOh, need we discuss it?\u201d she broke in, impatiently. \u201cIf I'm an unnatural child, why then I am one, and may it not be allowed to pass at that?\u201d A stormy kind of smile played upon her beautifully-cut lips as she added: \u201cSurely one's filial emotions are things to be taken for granted--relieved from the necessity of explanation.\u201d Thorpe grinned faintly at the hint of pleasantry, but he did not relinquish his point. \u201cWell--unless you really veto the thing--I think I'd like to tell him to come,\u201d he said, with composed obstinacy. Upon an afterthought he added: \u201cThere's no reason why he shouldn't meet the Duke, is there?\u201d \u201cNo specific reason,\u201d she returned, with calm coolness of tone and manner."}, {"size": 728, "text": "\u201cAnd certainly I do not see myself in the part of Madame Veto.\u201d \u201cAll right then--I'll send him a wire,\u201d said Thorpe. His victory made him uneasy, yet he saw no way of abandoning it with decorum. As the two, standing in a silence full of tacit constraint, looked aimlessly away from the terrace, they saw at the same instant a vehicle with a single horse coming rather briskly up the driveway, some hundreds of yards below. It was recognizable at once as the local trap from Punsey station, and as usual it was driven by a boy from the village. Seated beside this lad was a burly, red-bearded man in respectable clothes, who, to judge from the tin-box and travelling-bags fastened on behind, seemed coming to High Thorpe to stay."}, {"size": 826, "text": "\u201cWho on earth is that?\u201d asked Thorpe, wonderingly. The man was obviously of the lower class, yet there seemed something about him which invited recognition. \u201cPresumably it's the new head-gardener,\u201d she replied with brevity. Her accent recalled to Thorpe the fact that there had been something disagreeable in their conversation, and the thought of it was unpleasant to him. \u201cWhy, I didn't know you had a new man coming,\u201d he said, turning to her with an overture of smiling interest. \u201cYes,\u201d she answered, and then, as if weighing the proffered propitiation and rejecting it, turned slowly and went into the house. The trap apparently ended its course at some back entrance: he did not see it again. He strolled indoors, after a little, and told his man to pack a bag for London, and order the stanhope to take him to the train."}, {"size": 616, "text": "IN the early morning, long before any of the hotel people had made themselves heard moving about, Thorpe got up.It was a long time since he had liked himself and his surroundings so little. The bed seemed all right to the eye, and even to the touch, but he had slept very badly in it, none the less. The room was luxuriously furnished, as was the entire suite, but it was all strange and uncomfortable to his senses. The operation of shaving and dressing in solitude produced an oppression of loneliness. He regretted not having brought his man with him for this reason, and then, upon meditation, for other reasons."}, {"size": 651, "text": "A person of his position ought always to have a servant with him. The hotel people must have been surprised at his travelling unattended--and the people at High Thorpe must also have thought it strange. It flashed across his mind that no doubt his wife had most of all thought it strange. How would she explain to herself his sudden, precipitate journey to London alone? Might she not quite naturally put an unpleasant construction upon it? It was bad enough to have to remember that they had parted in something like a tiff; he found it much worse to be fancying the suspicions with which she would be turning over his mysterious absence in her mind."}, {"size": 870, "text": "He went downstairs as speedily as possible and, discovering no overt signs of breakfast in the vicinity of the restaurant, passed out and made his way to the Embankment. This had been a favourite walk of his in the old days--but he considered it now with an unsympathetic eye. It seemed a dry and haggard and desolate-looking place by comparison with his former impressions of it. The morning was grey-skied, but full of a hard quality of light, which brought out to the uncompromising uttermost the dilapidated squalor of the Surrey side. The water was low, and from the mud and ooze of the ugly opposite shore, or perhaps from the discoloured stream itself, there proceeded a smell which offended his unaccustomed nostril. A fitful, gusty wind was blowing from the east, and ever and again it gathered dust in eddying swoops from the roadway, and flung it in his face."}, {"size": 874, "text": "He walked on toward the City, without any conscious purpose, and with no very definite reflections. It occurred to him that if his wife did impute to him some unworthy motive in stealing off to London, and made herself unhappy in doing so--that would at least provide the compensation of showing that she cared. The thought, however, upon examination, contained very meagre elements of solace. He could not in the least be sure about any of the workings of her mind. There might be more or less annoyance mixed up this morning with the secret thoughts she had concerning him--or she might not be bothering her head about him at all. This latter contingency had never presented itself so frankly to him before. He looked hard at it, and saw more semblances of probability about it than he liked. It might very well be that she was not thinking about him one way or the other."}, {"size": 812, "text": "A depressing consciousness that practically nobody need think about him pervaded his soul. Who cared what he said or did or felt? The City had forgotten his very existence. In the West End, only here and there some person might chance to remember his name as that of some rich bounder who had married Lady Cressage. Nowhere else in England, save one dull strip of agricultural blankness in a backward home county, was there a human being who knew anything whatever about him. And this was his career! It was for this that he had planned that memorable campaign, and waged that amazing series of fortnightly battles, never missing victory, never failing at any point of the complicated strategy, and crowning it all with a culminating triumph which had been the wonder and admiration of the whole financial world!"}, {"size": 618, "text": "A few score of menials or interested inferiors bowed to him; he drove some good horses, and was attentively waited upon, and had a never-failing abundance of good things to eat and drink aud smoke. Hardly anything more than that, when you came to think of it--and the passing usufruct of all these things could be enjoyed by any fool who had a ten-pound note in his pocket! What gross trick had the fates played on him? He had achieved power--and where was that power? What had he done with it? What COULD he do with it? He had an excess of wealth, it was true, but in what way could it command an excess of enjoyment?"}, {"size": 731, "text": "The very phrase was a paradox, as he dimly perceived. There existed only a narrow margin of advantage in favour of the rich man. He could eat and drink a little more and a little better than the poor man; he could have better clothes, and lie abed later in the morning, and take life easier all round--but only within hard and fast bounds. There was an ascertained limit beyond which the millionaire could no more stuff himself with food and wine than could the beggar. It might be pleasant to take an added hour or two in bed in the morning, but to lie in bed all day would be an infliction. So it ran indefinitely--this thin selvedge of advantage which money could buy--with deprivation on the one side, and surfeit on the other."}, {"size": 714, "text": "Candidly, was it not true that more happiness lay in winning the way out of deprivation, than in inventing safeguards against satiety? The poor man succeeding in making himself rich--at numerous stages of the operation there might be made a moral snap-shot of the truly happy man. But not after he had reached the top. Then disintegration began at once. The contrast between what he supposed he could do, and what he finds it possible to do, is too vast to be accepted with equanimity. It must be said that after breakfast--a meal which he found in an Italian restaurant of no great cleanliness or opulence of pretension, and ate with an almost novel relish--Thorpe took somewhat less gloomy views of his position."}, {"size": 607, "text": "He still walked eastward, wandering into warehouse and shipping quarters skirting the river, hitherto quite unknown to him, and pursuing in an idle, inconsequent fashion his meditations. He established in his mind the proposition that since an excess of enjoyment was impossible--since one could not derive a great block of happiness from the satisfaction of the ordinary appetites, but at the most could only gather a little from each--the desirable thing was to multiply as much as might be those tastes and whims and fancies which passed for appetites, and thus expand the area of possible gratification."}, {"size": 691, "text": "This seemed very logical indeed, but it did not apply itself to his individual needs with much facility. What did he want to do that he had not done? It was difficult for him to say. Perhaps it was chandlers' signs and windows about him, and the indefinable seafaring preoccupation suggested by the high-walled, narrow streets, which raised the question of a yacht in his mind. Did he want a yacht? He could recall having once dwelt with great fondness upon such a project: doubtless it would still be full of attractions for him. He liked the water, and the water liked him--and he was better able now than formerly to understand how luxurious existence can be made in modern private ships."}, {"size": 620, "text": "He decided that he would have a yacht--and then perceived that the decision brought no exhilaration. He was no happier than before. He could decide that he would have anything he chose to name--and it would in no whit lighten his mood. The yacht might be as grand as High Thorpe, and relatively as spacious and well ordered, but would he not grow as tired of the one as he had of the other? He stopped short at this blunt self-expression of something he had never admitted to himself. Was he indeed tired of High Thorpe? He had assured his wife to the contrary yesterday. He reiterated the assurance to his own mind now."}, {"size": 758, "text": "It was instead that he was tired of himself. He carried a weariness about with him, which looked at everything with apathetic eyes, and cared for nothing. Some nameless paralysis had settled upon his capacity for amusement and enjoyment, and atrophied it. He had had the power to expand his life to the farthest boundaries of rich experience and sensation, and he had deliberately shrunk into a sort of herbaceous nonentity, whom nobody knew or cared about. He might have had London at his beck and call, and yet of all that the metropolis might mean to a millionaire, he had been able to think of nothing better than that it should send old Kervick to him, to help beguile his boredom with dominoes and mess-room stories! Pah! He was disgusted with himself."}, {"size": 879, "text": "Striking out a new course, with the Monument as his guide, he presently came into a part of the City which had a certain familiarity for him. He walked up St. Swithin's Lane, looking at the strange forms of foreign fruit exposed at the shop-doors, and finding in them some fleeting recurrence of the hint that travel was what he needed. Then he stopped, to look through the railings and open gateway at an enclosure on the left, and the substantial, heavily-respectable group of early Victorian buildings beyond. Some well-dressed men were standing talking in one of the porches. The stiff yellowish-stucco pilasters of this entrance, and the tall uniformed figure of the porter in the shadow, came into the picture as he observed it; they gave forth a suggestion of satisfied smugness--of orderly but altogether unillumined routine. Nothing could be more commonplace to the eye."}, {"size": 817, "text": "Yet to his imagination, eighteen months before, what mysterious marvels of power had lurked hidden behind those conventional portals! Within those doors, in some inner chamber, sat men whose task it was to direct the movements of the greatest force the world had ever known. They and their cousins in Paris and Frankfort, or wherever they lived, between them wielded a vaster authority than all the Parliaments of the earth. They could change a government, or crush the aspirations of a whole people, or decide a question of peace or war, by the silent dictum of their little family council. He remembered now how he had stood on this same spot, and stared with fascinated gaze at this quadrangle of dull houses, and pondered upon what it must feel like to be a Rothschild--and that was only a little over a year ago!"}, {"size": 711, "text": "There was no sense of fascination whatever in his present gaze. He found himself regarding instead, with a kind of detached curiosity, the little knot of men in frock-coats and silk-hats who stood talking in the doorway. It was barely ten o'clock, yet clearly business was proceeding within. One of these persons whom he beheld might be a Rothschild, for aught he knew; at any rate, it was presumable that some of them were on the premises. He had heard it said that the very head of the house listened to quotations from the tape while he ate his luncheon, and interrupted his conversations with the most important of non-commercial callers, to make or refuse bargains in shares offered by brokers who came in."}, {"size": 610, "text": "What impulse lay behind this extraordinary devotion to labour? Toward what conceivable goal could it be striving? To work hard and risk great things for the possession of a fortune, in order to enjoy it afterward--he could understand how that attracted men. But to possess already the biggest of human fortunes, and still work--that baffled him. He wished he knew some of those men in there, especially if they belonged to the place. It would be wonderfully interesting to get at the inner point of view of New Court. A little later, in Colin Semple's office, he sat down to await the coming of that gentleman."}, {"size": 640, "text": "\u201cThen he doesn't get here so early nowadays?\u201d he suggested to the head-clerk who, with instant recognition and exaggerated deference, had ushered him into this furthermost private room.

But I think he is stopping at his solicitors on his way to the City. I hope you are very well, sir.\u201d \u201cYes--I'm very fit--thanks,\u201d Thorpe said, listlessly, and the other left him.

The Scotchman, after a surprised instant, smiled. \u201cOh, I'll just keep my hands on it,\u201d he assured him, lightly. \u201cThat isn't what I mean,\u201d Thorpe said, groping after what he did mean, with sullen tenacity, among his thoughts."}, {"size": 650, "text": "His large, heavy face exhibited a depressed gravity which attracted the other's attention. \u201cWhat's the matter?\u201d Semple asked quickly. \u201cHas anything gone wrong with you?\u201d Thorpe slowly shook his head. \u201cWhat better off do you think you'll be with six figures than you are with five?\u201d he pursued, with dogmatic insistence. Semple shrugged his shoulders. He seemed to have grown much brighter and gayer of mood in this past twelvemonth.

What will a million give you, that the fifth of it, or the tenth of it, won't give you just as well?\u201d \u201cAye,\u201d said Semple, with a gleam of comprehension in his glance. \u201cSo you've come to that frame of mind, have you? Why does a man go on and shoot five hundred pheasants, when he can eat only one?\u201d \u201cOh, if you like the mere making of money, I've nothing more to say,\u201d Thorpe responded, with a touch of resentment."}, {"size": 619, "text": "\u201cI've always thought of you as a man like myself, who wanted to make his pile and then enjoy himself.\u201d The Scotchman laughed joyously. \u201cEnjoy myself!

He had glanced through some of them in a desultory fashion, cutting pages at random here and there, but for the most part he had looked straight before him at the broad landscape, mellowing now into soft browns and yellows under the mild, vague October sun."}, {"size": 674, "text": "He had not thought much of the books, but he had a certain new sense of enjoyment in the fruits of this placid, abstracted rumination which perhaps they had helped to induce. \u201cAbout your father,\u201d he said now, as his wife, who had come out to speak with him on some other matter, was turning to go away again: \u201cI'm afraid I annoyed you the other day by what I said.\u201d \u201cI have no recollection of it,\u201d she told him, with tranquil politeness, over her shoulder. He found himself all at once keenly desirous of a conversation on this topic. \u201cBut I want you to recollect,\u201d he said, as he rose to his feet. There was a suggestion of urgency in his tone which arrested her attention."}, {"size": 655, "text": "She moved slowly toward the chair, and after a little perched herself upon one of its big arms, and looked up at him where he leant against the parapet. \u201cI've thought of it a good deal,\u201d he went on, in halting explanation. His purpose seemed clearer to him than were the right phrases in which to define it. \u201cI persisted in saying that I'd do something you didn't want me to do--something that was a good deal more your affair than mine--and I've blamed myself for it. That isn't at all what I want to do.\u201d Her face as well as her silence showed her to be at a loss for an appropriate comment. She was plainly surprised, and seemingly embarrassed as well."}, {"size": 609, "text": "\u201cI'm sure you always wish to be nice,\u201d she said at last. The words and tone were alike gracious, but he detected in them somewhere a perfunctory note. \u201cOh--nice!\u201d he echoed, in a sudden stress of impatience with the word. \u201cDamn being 'nice'! Anybody can be 'nice.' I'm thinking of something ten thousand times bigger than being 'nice.'\u201d \u201cI withdraw the word immediately--unreservedly,\u201d she put in, with a smile in which he read that genial mockery he knew so well. \u201cYou laugh at me--whenever I try to talk seriously,\u201d he objected. \u201cI laugh?\u201d she queried, with an upward glance of demurely simulated amazement."}, {"size": 616, "text": "\u201cImpossible! I assure you I've forgotten how.\u201d \u201cAh, now we get to it!\u201d he broke out, with energy. \u201cYou're really feeling about it just as I am. You're not satisfied with what we're doing--with the life we're leading--any more than I am. I see that, plain enough, now. I didn't dream of it before. Somehow I got the idea that you were enjoying it immensely--the greenhouses and gardens and all that sort of thing. And do you know who it was that put me right--that told me you hated it?\u201d \u201cOh, don't let us talk of him!\u201d Edith exclaimed, swiftly. Thorpe laughed. \u201cYou're wrong.

She went on with a musing gravity. \u201cI'm sorry I don't get to know your sister. She seems an extremely real sort of person. I can understand that she might be difficult to live with--I daresay all genuine characters are--but she's very real.

Fancy that!\u201d He still frowned uneasily as he looked down at her. \u201cYou never mentioned to me that you had gone there,\u201d he told her, as if in reproach. \u201cAh, it was complicated,\u201d Edith explained. \u201cShe objects to knowing me--I think secretly I respect her a great deal for that--and therefore there is something clandestine about my getting to know her--and I could not be sure how it would impress you, and really it seemed simplest not to mention it.\u201d \u201cIt isn't that alone,\u201d he declared, grave-faced still, but with a softer voice."}, {"size": 788, "text": "\u201cDo you remember what I said the other day?

Oh, I'm not complaining; you mustn't think that. The agreement we made at the start--you've kept your part of it perfectly. You've done better than that: you've kept still about the fact that it made you unhappy.\u201d \u201cOh no,\u201d she interposed, gently. \u201cIt is not the fact that it has made me unhappy.\u201d"}, {"size": 645, "text": "\u201cWell--discontented, then,\u201d he resumed, without pause. \u201cHere we are.

I suppose, if the truth were known, I'm by way of being tired of it too. Well, if you look at it, that fact is the most important thing in the world for both of us.

He held her glance with his own, as he stood then, his head bent, gravely regarding her. \u201cDo you tell me that you are happy?\u201d he asked, with sober directness. She fluttered her hands in a little restrained gesture of comment. \u201cYou consider only the extremes,\u201d she told him. \u201cBetween black and white there are so many colours and shades and half-tones!

To myself I am not unhappy.\u201d \u201cWhy won't you tell me, Edith, just where you are?\u201d The sound of her name was somewhat unfamiliar to their discourse.

The year had wrought a baffling difference in him. He lacked something now that then he had possessed, but he was powerless to define it. He seated himself again in the chair, and put his hand through her arm to keep her where she lightly rested beside him. \u201cWill you tell me,\u201d he said, with a kind of sombre gentleness, \u201cwhat the word is that you would have used then?"}, {"size": 661, "text": "I know you wouldn't--couldn't--have called me 'nice.'

She turned from him a little, as if to hide the signs of her agitation. \u201cOh, what is there to say?\u201d she demanded, in a tone which was almost a wail. \u201cIt is not your fault. I'm not blaming you.\u201d \u201cWHAT is not my fault?\u201d he persisted with patient gentleness. Suddenly she confronted him.

You are bored to death--you confess it. And I--well, it is not what I thought it would be. I deceived myself. I do not reproach you.\u201d \u201cNo, you keep saying that,\u201d he observed, with gloomy slowness of utterance. \u201cBut what is it you reproach yourself with, then?

I married another because he had eighty thousand a year. That is the kind of beast I am. There is bad blood in me. You know my father; that is quite enough. I am his daughter; that explains everything.\u201d The exaggeration of her tone and words produced a curious effect upon him. He stared at her for a little, perceiving slowly that a new personage was being revealed to him. The mask of delicately-balanced cynicism, of amiably polite indifference, had been lifted; there was a woman of flesh and blood beneath it, after all--a woman to whom he could talk on terms of intimacy."}, {"size": 624, "text": "\u201cRubbish!\u201d he said, and his big face lightened into a genial, paternal smile. \u201cYou didn't marry me for my money at all!

It would have been the same if I hadn't had sixpence.\u201d To his sharp scrutiny there seemed to flicker in her eyes a kind of answering gleam. Then she hastily averted her glance, and in this action too there was a warrant for his mounting confidence. \u201cThe trouble has been,\u201d he declared, \u201cthat I've been too much afraid of you. I've thought that you were made of so much finer stuff than I am, that you mustn't be touched."}, {"size": 664, "text": "That was all a mistake. I see it right enough now.

I had the cheek to capture you and carry you off--and I ought to have had the pluck to make you love me afterward, and keep it up. And that's what I'm going to do!\u201d To this declaration she offered no immediate reply, but continued to gaze with a vaguely meditative air upon the expanse of landscape spread below them.

He waited for a long time, with a joyous patience, for her to speak. The mere fact that she stood beneath his engirdling arm, and gave no thought to the potential servants'-eyes behind them, was enough for present happiness. He regarded the illimitable picture commanded from his terrace with refreshed eyes; it was once again the finest view in England--and something much more than that beside."}, {"size": 645, "text": "At last, abruptly, she laughed aloud--a silvery, amused little laugh under her breath. \u201cHow comedy and tragedy tread forever on each other's heels!\u201d she remarked.

My buccaneer transforms himself, under my very eyes, into an alderman!

There was a delightful consciousness of new intimacy conveyed by the very touch of her arm, which filled his tone with buoyancy. \u201cI've been learning all sorts of tricks here, and getting myself into your ways of life. It's all been good training."}, {"size": 694, "text": "In every way I'm a better man than I was.\u201d They had descended from the terrace to a garden path, and approached now a long glass structure, through the panes of which masses of soft colour--whites, yellows, pinks, mauves, and strange dull reds--were dimly perceptible. \u201cThe chrysanthemums are not up to much this year,\u201d Edith observed, as they drew near to the door of this house. \u201cCollins did them very badly--as he did most other things.

You spoke about him--you'd known him somewhere--in the West Indies, wasn't it?\u201d He looked into vacancy with the aspect of one stupefied. \u201cDid I?\u201d he mumbled automatically. Then, with sudden decision, he swung round on the gravel. \u201cI've got a kind of headache coming on,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don't mind, we won't go inside among the flowers.\u201d"}, {"size": 861, "text": "THORPE walked along, in the remoter out-of-the-way parts of the great gardens, as the first shadows of evening began to dull the daylight.

But he could not lay hold of it to any comforting purpose. Some perverse force within him insisted on raising new phantoms in his path, and directing his reluctant gaze to their unpleasant shapes. Forgotten terrors pushed themselves upon his recollection.

His memory reconstructed a vivid picture of that approach--of the old ramshackle village trap, and the boy and the bags and the yellow tin trunk, and that decent, red-bearded, plebeian figure, so commonplace and yet so elusively suggestive of something out of the ordinary. It seemed to him now that he had at the time discerned a certain fateful quality in the apparition."}, {"size": 712, "text": "And he and his wife had actually been talking of old Kervick at the moment! It was their disagreement over him which had prevented her explaining about the new head-gardener. There was an effect of the uncanny in all this. And what did Gafferson want? How much did he know? The idea that perhaps old Kervick had found him out, and patched up with him a scheme of blackmail, occurred to him, and in the unreal atmosphere of his mood, became a thing of substance. With blackmail, however, one could always deal; it was almost a relief to see the complication assume that guise. But if Gafferson was intent upon revenge and exposure instead? With such a slug-like, patient, tenacious fool, was that not more likely?"}, {"size": 671, "text": "Reasonable arguments presented themselves to his mind ever and again: his wife had known of Gafferson's work, and thought highly of it, and had been in a position to learn of his leaving Hadlow.

His brother-in-law had gone off, and got too drunk to live, and had died. What in the name of all that was sensible had this to do with Thorpe? Why should it even be supposed that Gafferson associated Thorpe with any phase of the business? And if he had any notion of a hostile movement, why should he have delayed action so long? Why indeed!"}, {"size": 612, "text": "Reassurance did not come to him, but at last an impulse to definite action turned his footsteps toward the cluster of greenhouses in the deepening shadow of the mansion.

Ah, what was it that he would do? He could not say, beyond that it would be bad for Gafferson. He instinctively clenched the fists in the pockets of his jacket as he quickened his pace. Inside the congeries of glazed houses he was somewhat at sea."}, {"size": 681, "text": "It was still light enough to make one's way about in the passages between the stagings, but he had no idea of the general plan of the buildings, and it seemed to him that he frequently got back to places he had traversed before.

He tried to assume an idly indifferent air as he sauntered past, nodding almost imperceptible acknowledgment of the forefingers they jerked upward in salutation. He came at last upon a locked door, the key of which had been removed. The fact vaguely surprised him, and he looked with awakened interest through the panes of this door."}, {"size": 760, "text": "The air inside seemed slightly thickened--and then his eye caught the flicker of a flame, straight ahead. It was nothing but the fumigation of a house; the burning spirits in the lamp underneath the brazier were filling the structure with vapours fatal to all insect life. In two or three hours the men would come and open the doors and windows and ventilate the place. The operation was quite familiar to him; it had indeed interested him more when he first saw it done than had anything else connected with the greenhouses. His abstracted gaze happened to take note of the fact that the door-key was hanging on a nail overhead, and then suddenly this seemed to be related to something else in his thoughts--some obscure impression or memory which evaded him."}, {"size": 614, "text": "Continuing to look at the key, a certain recollection all at once assumed great definiteness in his mind: it came to him that the labels on this patent fumigator they were using warned people against exposing themselves to its fumes more than was absolutely necessary. That meant, of course, that their full force would kill a human being. It was very interesting. He looked through the glass again, but could not see that the air was any thicker.

Somehow the sight of the key, and of the poison-spreading flame inside the locked door, seemed to have prepared him for the spectacle of Gafferson close at hand.

He could strangle this annoying fool, or smother him, into non-resisting insensibility, and then put him inside that death-house, and let it be supposed that he had been asphyxiated by accident.

He approached the man silently, his brain arranging the details of the deed with calm celerity. Then some objections to the plan rose up before him: they dealt almost exclusively with the social nuisance the thing would entail. There was to be a house-party, with that Duke and Duchess in it, of whom his wife talked so much, and it would be a miserable kind of bore to have a suffocated gardener forced upon them as a principal topic of conversation."}, {"size": 633, "text": "Of course, too, it would more or less throw the whole household into confusion.

Already the notion of doing anything to wound or grieve her appeared incredible to him."}, {"size": 645, "text": "\u201cWell, Gafferson,\u201d he heard himself saying, in one of the more reserved tones of his patriarchal manner.

What use is it to succeed in hybridizing a Hippeastrum procera with a Pancratium Amancaes, after over six hundred attempts in ten years, and then spend three years a-hand-nursing the seedlings, and then your master won't take enough interest in the thing to pay your fare up to London to the exhibition with 'em?

The master turned upon his heel, with a brief, oblique nod over his shoulder, and made his way out into the open air. Here, as he walked, he drew a succession of long consolatory breaths. It was almost as if he had emerged from the lethal presence of the fumigator itself. He took the largest cigar from his case, lighted it, and sighed smoke-laden new relief as he strolled back toward the terrace."}, {"size": 620, "text": "But a few minutes before he had been struggling helplessly in the coils of an evil nightmare.

There was nothing worth remembering--only the shapeless and foolish burden of a bad dream. The assurance rose within him that he was not to have any more such trouble. With a singular clearness of mental vision he perceived that the part of him which brought bad dreams had been sloughed off, like a serpent's skin."}, {"size": 615, "text": "There had been two Thorpes, and one of them--the Thorpe who had always been willing to profit by knavery, and at last in a splendid coup as a master thief had stolen nearly a million, and would have shrunk not at all from adding murder to the rest, to protect that plunder--this vicious Thorpe had gone away altogether. There was no longer a place for him in life; he would never be seen again by mortal eye....There remained only the good Thorpe, the pleasant, well-intentioned opulent gentleman; the excellent citizen; the beneficent master, to whom, even Gafferson like the others, touched a respectful forelock."}, {"size": 792, "text": "It passed in the procession of his reverie as a kind of triumph of virtue that the good Thorpe retained the fortune which the bad Thorpe had stolen. It was in all senses a fortunate fact, because now it would be put to worthy uses. Considering that he had but dimly drifted about heretofore on the outskirts of the altruistic impulse, it was surprisingly plain to him now that he intended to be a philanthropist. Even as he mentioned the word to himself, the possibilities suggested by it expanded in his thoughts. His old dormant, formless lust for power stirred again in his pulses. What other phase of power carried with it such rewards, such gratitudes, such humble subservience on all sides as far as the eye could reach--as that exercised by the intelligently munificent philanthropist?"}, {"size": 787, "text": "Intelligence! that was the note of it all.

He would make no such mistake as that. It was easy enough to see wherein they erred. They gave superciliously, handing down their alms from a top lofty altitude of Tory superiority, and the Radicals down below sniffed or growled even while they grudgingly took these gifts--that was all nonsense."}, {"size": 698, "text": "These aristocratic or tuft-hunting philanthropists were the veriest duffers. They laid out millions of pounds in the vain attempt to secure what might easily be had for mere thousands, if they went sensibly to work. Their vast benefactions yielded them at the most bare thanks, or more often no thanks at all, because they lacked the wit to lay aside certain little trivial but annoying pretensions, and waive a few empty prejudices. They went on, year after year, tossing their fortunes into a sink of contemptuous ingratitude, wondering feebly why they were not beloved in return. It was because they were fools. They could not, or they would not, understand the people they sought to manipulate."}, {"size": 642, "text": "What could not a man of real brain, of real breadth and energy and force of character, do in London with two hundred thousand pounds?

He could reverse the partisan complexion of the Metropolitan delegation, and lead to Westminster a party of his own, a solid phalanx of disciplined men, standing for the implacable Democracy of reawakened London. With such a backing, he could coerce ministries at will, and remake the politics of England."}, {"size": 632, "text": "The role of Great Oliver himself was not too hopelessly beyond the scope of such a vision. Thorpe threw his cigar-end aside, and then noted that it was almost dark. He strode up to the terrace two steps at a time, and swung along its length with a vigour and exhilaration of movement he had not known, it seemed to him, for years. He felt the excitement of a new incentive bubbling in his veins. \u201cHer Ladyship is in her sitting-room, sir,\u201d a domestic replied to his enquiry in the hall.

Something impelled her to rise, and to put a certain wistfulness of enquiry into her answering smile. \u201cYour headache is better then?\u201d she asked him. He looked puzzled for a moment, then laughed lightly. \u201cOh--yes,\u201d he answered.

Her glance fluttered a little, and almost quailed, before the frank barbarism of power in the look he bent upon her. Then it came to her that something more was to be read in this look; there was in it a reservation of magnanimity, of protection, of entreating invitation, for her special self. He might tear down with his claws, and pull to pieces and devour others; but his mate he would shelter and defend and love with all his strength."}, {"size": 601, "text": "An involuntary trembling thrill ran through her--and then she smiled up at him. \u201cWhat is it you're going to do?\u201d she asked him, mechanically.

To look at him, as he loomed before her, uplifted by his refreshed and soaring self-confidence, it appeared not easy to say what would be impossible to him.

His face, with its little black moustache and large dark eyes, was fine upon examination, but in some elusively foreign way. There lingered a foreign note, too, in the way he talked. His speech was English enough to the ear, it was true, but it was the considered English of a book, and its phrases had a deftness which was hardly native."}, {"size": 682, "text": "He looked, if not a sad young man, then one conscious always of sufficient reasons for sadness, but one came, after a time, to see that the mood beneath was not melancholy. It had even its sprightly side, which shone out irregularly in his glance and talk, from a sober mean of amiable weariness. Thorpe knew his extraordinary story--that of a poor tutor, earning his living in ignorance of the fact that he had a birthright of any sort, who had been miraculously translated into the heir, not only to an ancient title but to vast collateral wealth. He had been born and reared in France, and it was there that the heralds of this stupendous change in his affairs had found him out."}, {"size": 711, "text": "There was a good deal more to the story, including numerous unsavoury legends about people now many years dead, and it was impossible to observe the young Duke and not seem to perceive signs that he was still nervously conscious of these legends. The story of his wife--a serene, grey-eyed, rather silent young person, with a pale face of some beauty, and with much purity and intellect--was strange enough to match. She also had earned her own living, as a private secretary or type-writing girl, or something of the sort, and her husband had deliberately chosen her after he had come into his title. One might study her very closely, however, and catch no hint that these facts in any degree disconcerted her."}, {"size": 692, "text": "Thorpe studied her a good deal, in a furtive way, with a curiosity born of his knowledge that the Duke had preferred her, when he might have married his widowed cousin, who was now Thorpe's own wife. How he had come to know this, he could never have told. He had breathed it in, somehow, with the gossip-laden atmosphere of that one London season of his. It was patent enough, too, that his wife--his Edith--had not only liked this ducal youngster very much, but still entertained toward him a considerable affection. She had never dissembled this feeling, and it visibly informed her glance and manner now, at her own table, when she turned to speak with him, where he sat at her right hand."}, {"size": 663, "text": "Thorpe had never dreamed of thinking ill of his wife's friendship, even when her indifference to what he thought had been most taken for granted. Now that this was all changed, and the amazing new glory of a lover had enveloped him, he had a distinct delight in watching the myriad charming phases of her kind manner, half-sisterly, half-motherly, toward the grave-faced young man. It was all a part of the delicious change which these past few days had wrought in her, this warm and supple softness of mien, of eye and smile and voice. But how the Duke, if really he had had a chance to marry Edith, could have taken the type-writer instead, baffled speculation."}, {"size": 652, "text": "Thorpe gave more attention to this problem, during dinner, than he did to the conversation of the table. His exchange of sporadic remarks with the young Duchess beside him was indeed an openly perfunctory affair, which left him abundant leisure to contemplate her profile in silence, while she turned to listen to the general talk, of which Miss Madden and the Hon. Winifred Plowden bore the chief burden. The talk of these ladies interested him but indifferently, though the frequent laughter suggested that it was amusing. He looked from his wife to the Duchess and back again, in ever-recurring surprise that the coronet had been carried past Edith."}, {"size": 714, "text": "And once he looked a long time at his wife and the Duke, and formulated the theory that she must have refused him. No doubt that was why she had been sympathetically fond of him ever since, and was being so nice to him now. Yes--clearly that was it. He felt upon this that he also liked the Duke very much. It was by no means so apparent that the Duke liked him. Both he and his Duchess, indeed, were scrupulously and even deferentially polite, but there was a painstaking effect about it, which, seemingly, they lacked the art altogether to conceal. It seemed to Thorpe that the other guests unconsciously took their cue from this august couple, and all exposed somewhat the effort their civility to him involved."}, {"size": 678, "text": "At another time the suspicion of this would have stung him. He had only to glance across the table to where his wife sat now, and it was all right. What other people thought of him--how other people liked or disliked him--was of no earthly importance. Whenever he chose to exert himself, he could compel from them the behaviour that he desired. It was their dull inability to read character which prompted them to regard him as merely a rich outsider who had married Edith Cressage. He viewed with a comfortable tolerance this infirmity of theirs. When the time came, if he wanted to do so, he could awaken them to their delusion as by forked lightning and the burst of thunder."}, {"size": 734, "text": "The whim came to him, and expanded swiftly into a determination, to contrive some intimate talk forthwith with the Duke. The young man seemed both clever and sensible, and in a way impressionable as well. Thorpe thought that he would probably have some interesting things to say, but still more he thought of him as a likely listener. It would be the easier to detach him from the company, since the occasion was one of studied informality. The Duke did not go about in society, in the ordinary sense of the word, and he would not have come to High Thorpe to meet a large party. He was here as a kinsman and friend of his hostess for a quiet week; and the few other guests fitted readily enough into the picture of a family gathering."}, {"size": 688, "text": "The spirit of domesticity had indeed so obviously descended upon the little group in the drawing-room, an hour or so after dinner, that Thorpe felt it quite the natural thing to put his arm through that of the Duke and lead him off to his personal smoking-room. He even published his intention by audibly bidding the Hon. Balder Plowden to remain with the ladies. When the two had seated themselves in soft, low easy-chairs, and the host had noted with pleasure that his guest had no effeminate qualms in the matter of large rich cigars, a brief silence ensued. \u201cI am very anxious to get your views on a certain subject,\u201d Thorpe was inspired to begin, bluntly pushing preliminaries aside."}, {"size": 678, "text": "\u201cIf a man of fortune wishes to do genuine good with his money, here in England, how should he best go about it?\u201d The Duke looked up at his questioner, with a sudden flash of surprise on his dark, mobile face.

The Duke pulled contemplatively at his cigar for a little. \u201cDo not think me a cynic,\u201d he began at last. \u201cYou are a man of affairs; you have made your own way; you should be even more free from illusions than I am. If you tell me that these good things can be done, I am the last one to dispute you. But I have seen near at hand experiments of exceptional importance, on a very grand scale, and the result does not encourage me."}, {"size": 778, "text": "I come to doubt indeed if money has any such power in these affairs as we think it has--for that matter, if it has any power at all. The shifting of money can always disorganize what is going on at the moment--change it about and alter it in many ways--but its effect is only temporary. As soon as the pressure is released, the human atoms rearrange themselves as they were before, and the old conditions return. I think the only force which really makes any permanent difference is character--and yet about even that I am not sure. The best man I have ever known--and in many respects the ablest--devoted untold energy and labour, and much money, too, to the service of a few thousand people in Somerset, on land of his own, upon a theory wonderfully elaborated and worked out."}, {"size": 858, "text": "Perhaps you have heard of Emanuel Torr and his colony, his System?\u201d Thorpe shook his head. \u201cHe had worked tremendously for years at it.

The property is mine now, and it is farmed and managed again in the ordinary way, and really the people there seem already to have forgotten that they had a prophet among them. The marvelous character of the man--you look in vain for any sign of an impress that it left upon them. I never go there. I cannot bear those people. I have sometimes the feeling that if it were feasible I should like to oppress them in some way--to hurt them.\u201d \u201cOh!

The record of these--generally a very faulty and foolish record--we call history. We say of these movements in the past that some of them were good and some were bad.

He had the arts and the books and the musicians and the silks and velvets, and the bath-tubs--everything that made existence gorgeous--all to himself.

They will believe in a man whose ambition is to win an earldom and five thousand a year out of politics, but they will stone to death the man who merely tries to get a few hundreds a year out of it for his wife and children.

And I'm going to have a try at it.\u201d \u201cIt is very interesting,\u201d remarked the Duke, with vagueness. \u201cBut--are the ladies waiting for us? And if so, aren't we keeping them up unconscionably?\u201d As if in comment upon his words, there was the sound of a faint rap at the door. Then it opened, and through the dense blue haze of the room they saw some shadowed forms softly indistinct save where the light from the ceiling outside shone down upon a group of coiffured heads. A noise of mingled coughing and laughter specifically completed the introduction."}, {"size": 615, "text": "\u201cOh, I'm--it's unendurable in there,\u201d spoke the voice of the hostess. \u201cWe WERE coming in to smoke with you,\u201d she called out through the cloud, \u201csince you wouldn't stop with us.\u201d \u201cCome along!\u201d answered Thorpe, cheerily. He strode to the end of the room and raised a window. From the same corner he turned on some added lights. Under this more effective illumination, the lady of the house advanced, with Miss Madden and the Hon. Winifred close behind her. \u201cFrank has gone to bed,\u201d she explained to the Duke, who had risen. Then she turned to her husband a bright-eyed glance: \u201cYou don't mind--our coming?\u201d she asked."}, {"size": 635, "text": "\u201cMind!\u201d he called out, with robust impressiveness. \u201cMind!\u201d As if to complete the expression of his meaning, he threw his arm loosely about her, where she stood, and brought her to his side. They remained standing thus, before the fireplace, after the others were all seated. \u201cMr. Thorpe has been outlining to me the most wonderful plans,\u201d said the Duke, looking from one face to another, with a reserved smile. \u201cIt seems that philanthropy fails unless it is combined with very advanced politics. It is a new idea to me--but he certainly states it with vigour. Do you understand it, Edith?\u201d \u201cOh, perfectly,\u201d replied the wife, smilingly."}, {"size": 697, "text": "\u201cI am his first convert. Behold in me the original disciple.\u201d \u201cThe worst of that is,\u201d commented Thorpe, with radiant joviality, \u201cshe would subscribe to any other new doctrine of mine just as readily.\u201d He tightened the arm encircling her by a perceptible trifle. \u201cWouldn't you, sweetheart?\u201d he demanded. She seemed in nowise embarrassed by these overt endearments. There was indeed the dimmest suggestion in her face and voice of a responsive mood. \u201cReally,\u201d she began, with a soft glance, half-deprecation, half-pride, bent upon the others, and with thoughtful deliberation,--\u201creally the important thing is that he should pursue some object--have in view something that he is determined to master."}, {"size": 520, "text": "Without that, he is not contented--not at his best. He should have been a soldier. He has a passion for battle in his blood. And now that he sees something he is eager to do--I am very glad. It makes it none the less acceptable that good is to come from it.\u201d \u201cI still maintain,\u201d said Miss Madden, interpolating her words through the task of lighting a cigarette, and contriving for them an effect of drollery which appealed to Thorpe most of all--\u201cI shall always insist, just the same, that crime was his true vocation.\u201d"}]}
