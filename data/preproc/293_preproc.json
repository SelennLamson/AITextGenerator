   "text": "PAUL PRESCOTT'S HOME. We will precede Ben on his visit to the house of Mr. Prescott. It was an old weather-beaten house, of one story, about half a mile distant from 'Squire Newcome's residence. The Prescott family had lived here for five years, or ever since they had removed to Wrenville. Until within a year they had lived comfortably, when two blows came in quick succession. The first was the death of Mrs. Prescott, an excellent woman, whose loss was deeply felt by her husband and son. Soon afterwards Mr. Prescott, a carpenter by trade, while at work upon the roof of a high building, fell off, and not only broke his leg badly, but suffered some internal injury of a still more serious nature. He had not been able to do a stroke of work since. After some months it became evident that he would never recover. A year had now passed. During this time his expenses had swallowed up the small amount which he had succeeded in laying up previous to his sickness. It was clear that at his death there would be nothing left. At thirteen years of age Paul would have to begin the world without a penny. Mr. Prescott lay upon a bed in a small bedroom adjoining the kitchen. Paul, a thoughtful-looking boy sat beside it, ready to answer his call. There had been silence for some time, when Mr. Prescott called feebly-- “I am here, father,” said Paul. “I am almost gone, Paul, I don't think I shall last through the day.” “O, father,” said Paul, sorrowfully, “Don't leave me.” “That is the only grief I have in dying--I must leave you to struggle for yourself, Paul.",

I am young and strong--I can earn my living in some way.” “I hoped to live long enough to give you an education. I wanted you to have a fairer start in the world than I had.” “Never mind, father,” said Paul, soothingly, “Don't be uneasy about me. God will provide for me.” Again there was a silence, broken only by the difficult breathing of the sick man.",

   "text": "“There is one thing, Paul, that I want to tell you before I die.” Paul drew closer to the bedside. “It is something which has troubled me as I lay here. I shall feel easier for speaking of it. You remember that we lived at Cedarville before we came here.” “About two years before we left there, a promising speculation was brought to my notice. An agent of a Lake Superior mine visited our village and represented the mine in so favorable a light that many of my neighbors bought shares, fully expecting to double their money in a year. Among the rest I was attacked with the fever of speculation. I had always been obliged to work hard for a moderate compensation, and had not been able to do much more than support my family. This it seemed to me, afforded an excellent opportunity of laying up a little something which might render me secure in the event of a sudden attack of sickness. I had but about two hundred dollars, however, and from so scanty an investment I could not, of course, expect a large return; accordingly I went to Squire Conant; you remember him, Paul?” 'I went to him and asked a loan of five hundred dollars. After some hesitation he agreed to lend it to me. He was fond of his money and not much given to lending, but it so happened that he had invested in the same speculation, and had a high opinion of it, so he felt pretty safe in advancing me the money. Well, this loan gave me seven hundred dollars, with which I purchased seven shares in the Lake Superior Grand Combination Mining Company.",

   "text": "For some months afterwards, I felt like a rich man. I carefully put away my certificate of stock, looking upon it as the beginning of a competence. But at the end of six months the bubble burst--the stock proved to be utterly worthless,--Squire Conant lost five thousand dollars. I lost seven hundred, five hundred being borrowed money. The Squire's loss was much larger, but mine was the more serious, since I lost everything and was plunged into debt, while he had at least forty thousand dollars left. “Two days after the explosion, Squire Conant came into my shop and asked abruptly when I could pay him the amount I had borrowed. I told him that I could not fix a time. I said that I had been overwhelmed by a result so contrary to my anticipations, but I told him I would not rest till I had done something to satisfy his claim. He was always an unreasonable man, and reproached me bitterly for sinking his money in a useless speculation, as if I could foresee how it would end any better than he.” “Have you ever been able to pay back any part of the five hundred dollars, father?” “I have paid the interest regularly, and a year ago, just before I met with my accident, I had laid up a hundred and fifty dollars which I had intended to pay the Squire, but when my sickness came I felt obliged to retain it to defray our expenses, being cut off from earning anything.” “Then I suppose you have not been able to pay interest for the last year.”",

   "text": "“Have you heard from the Squire lately?” “Yes, I had a letter only last week. You remember bringing me one postmarked Cedarville?” “Yes, I wondered at the time who it could be from.” “You will find it on the mantelpiece. I should like to have you get it and read it.” Paul readily found the letter. It was enclosed in a brown envelope, directed in a bold hand to “Mr. John Prescott, Wrenville.” The letter was as follows:-- CEDARVILLE, APRIL 15, 18--, SIR: I have been waiting impatiently to hear something about the five hundred dollars in which sum you are indebted to me, on account of a loan which I was fool enough to make you seven years since. I thought you an honest man, but I have found, to my cost, that I was mistaken. For the last year you have even failed to pay interest as stipulated between us. Your intention is evident. I quite understand that you have made up your mind to defraud me of what is rightfully mine. I don't know how you may regard this, but I consider it as bad as highway robbery. I do not hesitate to say that if you had your deserts you would be in the Penitentiary. Let me advise you, if you wish to avoid further trouble, to make no delay in paying a portion of this debt. Yours, etc. EZEKIEL CONANT. Paul's face flushed with indignation as he read this bitter and cruel letter. “Does Squire Conant know that you are sick, father?” he inquired. “Yes, I wrote him about my accident, telling him at the same time that I regretted it in part on account of the interruption which it must occasion in my payments.” “And",

He would never miss it if he had given it to you outright.” “That is not the way to look at it, Paul. The money is justly his, and it is a great sorrow to me that I must die without paying it.” “Father,” said Paul, after a pause, “will it be any relief to you, if I promise to pay it,--that is, if I am ever able?” Mr. Prescott's face brightened. “That was what I wanted to ask you, Paul. It will be a comfort to me to feel that there is some hope of the debt being paid at some future day.” “Then don't let it trouble you any longer, father. The debt shall be mine, and I will pay it.” Again a shadow passed over the sick man's face, “Poor boy,” he said, “why should I burden your young life with such a load? You will have to struggle hard enough as it is. No, Paul, recall your promise. I don't want to purchase comfort at such a price.” “No, father,” said Paul sturdily, “it is too late now. I have made the promise and I mean to stick to it. Besides, it will give me something to live for. I am young--I may have a great many years before me. For thirteen years you have supported me. It is only right that I should make what return I can. I'll keep my promise, father.” “May God help and prosper you, my boy,” said Mr.",

I think I will try to go to sleep.” Paul smoothed the comforter, adjusting it carefully about his father's neck, and going to the door went out in search of some wood to place upon the fire. Their scanty stock of firewood was exhausted, and Paul was obliged to go into the woods near by, to obtain such loose fagots as he might find upon the ground. He was coming back with his load when his attention was drawn by a whistle. Looking up he discovered Ben Newcome approaching him.",

He said he was tired just before I went out.” “I brought over something for you,” said Ben, tugging away at his pocket. Opening a paper he displayed a couple of apple turnovers fried brown. “I found 'em in the closet,” he said. “Won't Hannah make a precious row when she finds 'em gone?” “Then I don't know as I ought to take them,” said Paul, though, to tell the truth, they looked tempting to him. “O, nonsense,” said Ben; “they don't belong to Hannah. She only likes to scold a little; it does her good.” The two boys sat on the doorstep and talked while Paul ate the turnovers. Ben watched the process with much satisfaction. “Ain't they prime?” he said. “First rate,” said Paul; “won't you have one?” “No,” said Ben; “you see I thought while I was about it I might as well take four, so I ate two coming along.” In about fifteen minutes Paul went into the house to look at his father. He was lying very quietly upon the bed. Paul drew near and looked at him more closely. There was something in the expression of his father's face which terrified him. Ben heard his sudden cry of dismay, and hurriedly entered. Paul pointed to the bed, and said briefly, “Father's dead!” Ben, who in spite of his mischievous propensities was gifted with a warm heart, sat down beside Paul, and passing his arm round his neck, gave him that silent sympathy which is always so grateful to the grief-stricken heart.",

   "text": "PAUL'S BRILLIANT PROSPECTS. Two days later, the funeral of Mr. Prescott took place. Poor Paul! It seemed to him a dream of inexpressible sorrow. His father and mother both gone, he felt that he was indeed left alone in the world. No thought of the future had yet entered his mind. He was wholly occupied with his present sorrow. Desolate at heart he slipped away from the graveyard after the funeral ceremony was over, and took his way back again to the lonely dwelling which he had called home. As he was sitting in the corner, plunged in sorrowful thought, there was a scraping heard at the door, and a loud hem! Looking up, Paul saw entering the cottage the stiff form of Squire Benjamin Newcome, who, as has already been stated, was the owner. “Paul,” said the Squire, with measured deliberation. “Do you mean me, sir?” asked Paul, vaguely conscious that his name had been called. “Did I not address you by your baptismal appellation?” demanded the Squire, who thought the boy's question superfluous. “Paul,” pursued Squire Newcome, “have you thought of your future destination?” “No, sir,” said Paul, “I suppose I shall live here.” “That arrangement would not be consistent with propriety. I suppose you are aware that your deceased parent left little or no worldly goods.” “I know he was poor.” “Therefore it has been thought best that you should be placed in charge of a worthy man, who I see is now approaching the house.",

If you obey him and read the Bible regularly, you will--ahem!--you will some time or other see the advantage of it.” With this consolatory remark Squire Newcome wheeled about and strode out of the house. Immediately afterwards there entered a rough-looking man arrayed in a farmer's blue frock. “You're to come with me, youngster,” said Mr. Nicholas Mudge, for that was his name. “With you?” said Paul, recoiling instinctively. In fact there was nothing attractive in the appearance or manners of Mr. Mudge. He had a coarse hard face, while his head was surmounted by a shock of red hair, which to all appearance had suffered little interference from the comb for a time which the observer would scarcely venture to compute. There was such an utter absence of refinement about the man, that Paul, who had been accustomed to the gentle manners of his father, was repelled by the contrast which this man exhibited. “To be sure you're to go with me,” said Mr. Mudge. “You did not calc'late you was a goin' to stay here by yourself, did you? We've got a better place for you than that. But the wagon's waitin' outside, so just be lively and bundle in, and I'll carry you to where you're a goin' to live.”",

So jest be a movin', for I can't be a waitin' here all day.” Paul quietly submitted himself to the guidance of Mr. Mudge. He was so occupied with the thought of his sad loss that he did not realize the change that was about to take place in his circumstances. About half a mile from the village in the bleakest and most desolate part of the town, stood the Poor House. It was a crazy old building of extreme antiquity, which, being no longer considered fit for an ordinary dwelling-house, had been selected as a suitable residence for the town's poor. It was bleak and comfortless to be sure, but on that very account had been purchased at a trifling expense, and that was, of course, a primary consideration. Connected with the house were some dozen acres of rough-looking land, plentifully overspread with stones, which might have filled with despair the most enterprising agriculturist. However, it had this recommendation at least, that it was quite in character with the buildings upon it, which in addition to the house already described, consisted of a barn of equal antiquity and a pig pen. This magnificent domain was under the superintendence of Mr. Nicholas Mudge, who in consideration of taking charge of the town paupers had the use of the farm and buildings, rent free, together with a stipulated weekly sum for each of the inmates.",

How do you like it?” Thus addressed, Paul ventured a glance around him. “I don't know,” said he, doubtfully; “it don't look very pleasant.” “Don't look very pleasant!” repeated Mr. Mudge in a tone of mingled amazement and indignation. “Well, there's gratitude for you. After the town has been at the expense of providin' a nice, comfortable home for you, because you haven't got any of your own, you must turn up your nose at it.” “I didn't mean to complain,” said Paul, feeling very little interest in the matter. “Perhaps you expected to live in a marble palace,” pursued Mr. Mudge, in an injured tone. “We don't have any marble palaces in this neighborhood, we don't.” Paul disclaimed any such anticipation. Mr. Mudge deigned to accept Paul's apology, and as they had now reached the door, unceremoniously threw it open, and led the way into a room with floor unpainted, which, to judge from its appearance, was used as a kitchen.",

In the midst of the scene was a large stout woman, in a faded calico dress, and sleeves rolled up, working as if her life or the world's destiny depended upon it. It was evident from the first words of Mr. Mudge that this lady was his helpmeet. “Well, wife,” he said, “I've brought you another boarder. You must try to make him as happy and contented as the rest of 'em are.” From the tone of the speaker, the last words might be understood to be jocular. Mrs. Mudge, whose style of beauty was not improved by a decided squint, fixed a scrutinizing gaze upon Paul, and he quite naturally returned it. “Haven't you ever seen anybody before, boy? I guess you'll know me next time.” “Shouldn't wonder if he did,” chuckled Mr. Mudge. “I don't know where on earth we shall put him,” remarked the lady. “We're full now.” “Oh, put him anywhere. I suppose you won't be very particular about your accommodations?” said Mr. Mudge turning to Paul. Paul very innocently answered in the negative, thereby affording Mr. Mudge not a little amusement. “Well, that's lucky,” he said, “because our best front chamber's occupied just now. We'd have got it ready for you if you'd only wrote a week ago to tell us you were coming. You can just stay round here,” he said in a different tone as he was about leaving the room, “Mrs.",

The water was to be brought from a well in the yard, and to this office Paul was at once delegated. It was no easy task, the full pails tugging most unmercifully at his arms. However, this was soon over, and Mrs. Mudge graciously gave him permission to go into the adjoining room, and make acquaintance with his fellow-boarders. There were nine of them in all, Paul, the newcomer making the tenth. They were all advanced in years, except one young woman, who was prevented by mental aberration from supporting herself outside the walls of the Institution. Of all present, Paul's attention was most strongly attracted towards one who appeared more neatly and scrupulously attired than any of the rest. Aunt Lucy Lee, or plain Aunt Lucy, for in her present abode she had small use for her last name, was a benevolent-looking old lady, who both in dress and manners was distinguished from her companions. She rose from her knitting, and kindly took Paul by the hand. Children are instinctive readers of character, and Paul, after one glance at her benevolent face, seated himself contentedly beside her. “I suppose,” said the old lady, socially, “you've come to live with us. We must do all we can to make you comfortable. Your name is Paul Prescott, I think Mrs.",

So now we know each other, and shall soon be good friends, I hope. I suppose you have hardly been here long enough to tell how you shall like it.” Paul confessed that thus far he did not find it very pleasant. “No, I dare say not,” said Aunt Lucy, “I can't say I think it looks very attractive myself. However, it isn't wholly the fault of Mr. and Mrs. Mudge. They can't afford to do much better, for the town allows them very little.” Aunt Lucy's remarks were here interrupted by the apparition of the worthy landlady at the door. “Dinner's ready, folks,” said that lady, with little ceremony, “and you must come out quick if you want any, for I'm drove with work, and can't be hindered long.” The summons was obeyed with alacrity, and the company made all haste to the dining-room, or rather the kitchen, for it was here that the meals were eaten. In the center of the room was set a table without a cloth, a table-cloth being considered a luxury quite superfluous. Upon this were placed several bowls of thin, watery liquid, intended for soup, but which, like city milk, was diluted so as hardly to be distinguishable. Beside each bowl was a slice of bread. Such was the bill of fare. “Now, folks, the sooner you fall to the better,” exclaimed the energetic Mrs.",

The present company appeared to need no second invitation. Their scanty diet had the positive advantage of giving them a good appetite; otherwise the quality of their food might have daunted them. Paul took his place beside Aunt Lucy. Mechanically he did as the rest, carrying to his mouth a spoonful of the liquid. But his appetite was not sufficiently accustomed to Poor House regime to enable him to relish its standing dish, and he laid down his spoon with a disappointed look. He next attacked the crust of bread, but found it too dry to be palatable. “Please, ma'am,” said he to Mrs. Mudge, “I should like some butter.” Paul's companions dropped their spoons in astonishment at his daring, and Mrs. Mudge let fall a kettle she was removing from the fire, in sheer amazement. “What did you ask for?” she inquired, as if to make sure that her ears did not deceive her. “A little butter,” repeated Paul, unconscious of the great presumption of which he had been guilty. “You want butter, do you?” repeated Mr. Mudge. “Perhaps you'd like a slice of beefsteak and a piece of plum-pudding too, wouldn't you?” “I should very much,” said Paul, resolved to tell the truth, although he now began to perceive the sarcasm in his landlady's tone. “There isn't anything more you would like, is there?” inquired the lady, with mock politeness.",

A mighty fine gentleman, to be sure. But you won't get them here, I'll be bound.” “So will I,” thought Aunt Lucy. “If you ain't satisfied with what I give you,” pursued Mrs. Mudge, “you'd better go somewhere else. You can put up at some of the great hotels. Butter, forsooth!” Having thus given expression to her feelings, she left the room, and Paul was left to finish his dinner with the best appetite he could command. He was conscious that he had offended Mrs. Mudge, but the thoughts of his recent great sorrow swallowed up all minor annoyances, so that the words of his estimable landlady were forgotten almost as soon as they were uttered. He felt that he must henceforth look for far different treatment from that to which he had been accustomed during his father's lifetime. His thoughts were interrupted in a manner somewhat ludicrous, by the crazy girl who sat next to him coolly appropriating to herself his bowl of soup, having already disposed of her own. “Look,” said Aunt Lucy, quickly, calling Paul's attention, “you are losing your dinner.” “Never mind,” said Paul, amused in spite of his sadness, “she is quite welcome to it if she likes it; I can't eat it.” So the dinner began and ended.",

Accordingly Mrs. Mudge softened down at once, on learning that Ben was his son. “Oh,” said she, “I didn't know who it was. I thought it might be some idle boy from the village who would only take Paul from his work, but if you have a message from your father----” This she said to ascertain whether he really had any message or not, but Ben, who had in fact come without his father's knowledge, only bowed, and said, in a patronizing manner, “I accept your apology, Mrs. Mudge. Will you have the goodness to send Paul out?” “Won't you step in?” asked Mrs. Mudge with unusual politeness. Paul was accordingly sent out. He was very glad to meet his schoolmate and playfellow, Ben, who by his gayety, spiced though it was with roguery, had made himself a general favorite in school. “I say, Paul,” said Ben, “I'm sorry to find you in such a place.” “It isn't very pleasant,” said Paul, rather soberly. “And that woman--Mrs. Mudge--she looks as if she might be a regular spitfire, isn't she?”",

But I say, Paul, go and get your hat, and we'll go out for a walk.” “I don't know what Mrs. Mudge will say,” said Paul, who had just come from turning the handle of a churn. “Just call Mrs. Mudge, and I'll manage it.” Mrs. Mudge being summoned, made her appearance at the door. “I presume, ma'am,” said Ben, confidently, “you will have no objection to Paul's taking a walk with me while I deliver the message I am entrusted with.” “Certainly,” said Mrs. Mudge, rather unwillingly, but not venturing to refuse. “It takes me to come it over the old lady,” said Ben, when they were out of hearing. “Now, we'll go a fishing.” Before sunrise the next morning Paul was awakened by a rude shake from Mr. Mudge, with an intimation that he had better get up, as there was plenty of work before him. By the light of the lantern, for as yet it was too dark to dispense with it, Paul dressed himself. Awakened from a sound sleep, he hardly had time to collect his thoughts, and it was with a look of bewilderment that he surveyed the scene about him. As Mrs. Mudge had said, they were pretty full already, and accordingly a rude pallet had been spread for him in the attic, of which, with the exception of nocturnal marauders, he was the only occupant. Paul had not, to be sure, been used to very superior accommodations, and if the bed had not been quite so hard, he would have got along very well.",

It was therefore with a sense of weariness which slumber had not dissipated, that Paul arose at the summons of Mr. Mudge. When he reached the kitchen, he found that gentleman waiting for him. “Do you know how to milk?” was his first salutation. “I never learned,” said Paul. “Then you'll have to, in double-quick time,” was the reply, “for I don't relish getting up so early, and you can take it off my hands.” The two proceeded to the barn, where Paul received his first lesson in this important branch of education. Mr. Mudge kept five cows. One might have thought he could have afforded a moderate supply of milk to his boarders, but all, with the exception of a single quart, was sold to the milkman who passed the door every morning. After breakfast, which was on the same economical plan with the dinner of the day previous, Paul was set to work planting potatoes, at which he was kept steadily employed till the dinner-hour. Poor Paul! his back ached dreadfully, for he had never before done any harder work than trifling services for his father. But the inexorable Mr. Mudge was in sight, and however much he wished, he did not dare to lay aside his hoe even for a moment. Twelve o'clock found him standing beside the dinner-table. He ate more heartily than before, for his forenoon's labor made even poorhouse fare palatable.",

I thought you wouldn't hold out long.” Paul, who had worn off something of his diffidence, could not help feeling indignant at this speech; unaccustomed to be addressed in this way, the taunt jarred upon his feelings, but he only bit his lip and preserved silence. Aunt Lucy, too, who had come to feel a strong interest in Paul, despite her natural mildness, could not resist the temptation of saying with some warmth, “what's the use of persecuting the child? He has sorrows enough of his own without your adding to them.” Mrs. Mudge was not a little incensed at this remonstrance. “I should like to know, ma'am, who requested you to put in your oar!” she said with arms akimbo. “Anybody wouldn't think from your lofty airs that you lived in the poorhouse; I'll thank you to mind your own business in the future, and not meddle with what don't concern you.” Aunt Lucy was wise enough to abstain from provoking further the wrath of her amiable landlady, and continued to eat her soup in silence. But Mrs. Mudge neer forgot this interference, nor the cause of it, and henceforth with the malignity of a narrow-minded and spiteful woman, did what she could to make Paul uncomfortable.

Assured of the sympathy of those around him, he did not allow his appetite to be spoiled by any remark which Mrs. Mudge might offer. This, of course, only provoked her the more, and she strove to have his daily tasks increased, in the amiable hope that his “proud spirit” might be tamed thereby. Mr. Mudge, who was somewhat under petticoat government, readily acceded to his wife's wishes, and henceforth Paul's strength was taxed to its utmost limit. He was required to be up with the first gray tint of dawn and attend to the cattle. From this time until night, except the brief time devoted to his meals, he was incessantly occupied. Aunt Lucy's society, his chief comfort, was thus taken from him; since, in order to rise early, he was obliged to go to bed as soon as possible after day's work was finished. The effects of such incessant labor without a sufficient supply of nourishing food, may easily be imagined. The dry bread and meagre soup which constituted the chief articles of diet in Mrs. Mudge's economical household, had but one recommendation,--they were effectual preventives of gluttony. It was reported that on one occasion a beggar, apparently famishing with hunger, not knowing the character of the house, made application at the door for food. In an unusual fit of generosity, Mrs.",

One day, as Paul was working in the field at a little distance from Mr. Mudge, he became conscious of a peculiar feeling of giddiness which compelled him to cling to the hoe for support,--otherwise he must have fallen. “No laziness there,” exclaimed Mr. Mudge, observing Paul's cessation from labor, “We can't support you in idleness.” But the boy paid no regard to this admonition, and Mr. Mudge, somewhat surprised, advanced toward him to enforce the command. Even he was startled at the unusual paleness of Paul's face, and inquired in a less peremptory tone, “what's the matter?” “I feel sick,” gasped Paul. Without another word, Mr. Mudge took Paul up in his arms and carried him into the house. “What's the matter, now?” asked his wife, meeting him at the door. “The boy feels a little sick, but I guess he'll get over it by-and by. Haven't you got a little soup that you can give him? I reckon he's faint, and that'll brighten him up.” Paul evidently did not think so, for he motioned away a bowl of the delightful mixture, though it was proffered him by the fair hands of Mrs. Mudge. The lady was somewhat surprised, and said, roughly, “I shouldn't wonder if he was only trying to shirk.” This was too much even for Mr. Mudge; “The boy's sick,” said he, “that's plain enough; if he don't get better soon, I must send for the doctor, for work drives, and I can't spare him.” “There's no more danger of his being sick than mine,” said Mrs.",

As to his being pale, I've been as pale as that myself sometimes without your troubling yourself very much about me.” “'Twon't be any expense to us,” alleged Mr. Mudge, in a tone of justification, for he felt in some awe of his wife's temper, which was none of the mildest when a little roused, “'Twon't be any expense to us; the town has got to pay for it, and as long as it will get him ready for work sooner, we might as well take advantage of it.” This consideration somewhat reconciled Mrs. Mudge to the step proposed, and as Paul, instead of getting better, grew rapidly worse, Mr. Mudge thought it expedient to go immediately for the village physician. Luckily Dr. Townsend was at home, and an hour afterwards found him standing beside the sick boy. “I don't know but you'll think it rather foolish, our sending for you, doctor,” said Mrs. Mudge, “but Mudge would have it that the boy was sick and so he went for you.” “And he did quite right,” said Dr. Townsend, noticing the ghastly pallor of Paul's face. “He is a very sick boy, and if I had not been called I would not have answered for the consequences. How do you feel, my boy?” he inquired of Paul. “I feel very weak, and my head swims,” was the reply. “How and when did this attack come on?” asked the doctor, turning to Mr.",

I used to do it, but since he has learned, I have indulged myself a little.” “It would have been well for him if he had enjoyed the same privilege. It is my duty to speak plainly. The sickness of this boy lies at your door. He has never been accustomed to hard labor, and yet you have obliged him to rise earlier and work later than most men. No wonder he feels weak. Has he a good appetite?” “Well, rather middlin',” said Mrs. Mudge, “but it's mainly because he's too dainty to eat what's set before him. Why, only the first day he was here he turned up his nose at the bread and soup we had for dinner.” “Is this a specimen of the soup?” asked Dr. Townsend, taking from the table the bowl which had been proffered to Paul and declined by him. Without ceremony he raised to his lips a spoonful of the soup and tasted it with a wry face. “Do you often have this soup on the table?” he asked abruptly. “We always have it once a day, and sometimes twice,” returned Mrs. Mudge. “And you call the boy dainty because he don't relish such stuff as this?” said the doctor, with an indignation he did not attempt to conceal.",

Mr. Mudge therefore contented himself with muttering that he guessed he worked as hard as anybody, and he didn't complain of his fare. “May I ask you, Mr. Mudge,” said the doctor, fixing his penetrating eye full upon him, “whether you confine yourself to the food upon which you have kept this boy?” “Well,” said Mr. Mudge, in some confusion, moving uneasily in his seat, “I can't say but now and then I eat something a little different.” “Do you eat at the same table with the inmates of your house?” “Well, no,” said the embarrassed Mr. Mudge. “Tell me plainly,--how often do you partake of this soup?” “I aint your patient,” said the man, sullenly, “Why should you want to know what I eat?” “I have an object in view.

Without waiting for a reply, Dr. Townsend ordered Paul to be put to bed immediately, after which he would leave some medicine for him to take. Here was another embarrassment for the worthy couple. They hardly knew where to put our hero. It would not do for them to carry him to his pallet in the attic, for they felt sure that this would lead to some more plain speaking on the part of Dr. Townsend. He was accordingly, though with some reluctance, placed in a small bedroom upstairs, which, being more comfortable than those appropriated to the paupers, had been reserved for a son at work in a neighboring town, on his occasional visits home. “Is there no one in the house who can sit in the chamber and attend to his occasional wants?” asked Dr. Townsend. “He will need to take his medicine at stated periods, and some one will be required to administer it.” “There's Aunt Lucy Lee,” said Mrs. Mudge, “she's taken a fancy to the boy, and I reckon she'll do as well as anybody.” “No one better,” returned the doctor, who well knew Aunt Lucy's kindness of disposition, and was satisfied that she would take all possible care of his patient.",

Paul was sick for many days,--not dangerously so, but hard work and scanty fare had weakened him to such a degree that exhausted nature required time to recruit its wasted forces. But he was not unhappy or restless. Hour after hour he would lie patiently, and listen to the clicking of her knitting needles. Though not provided with luxurious food, Dr. Townsend had spoken with so much plainness that Mrs. Mudge felt compelled to modify her treatment, lest, through his influence, she with her husband, might lose their situation. This forced forbearance, however, was far from warming her heart towards its object. Mrs. Mudge was a hard, practical woman, and her heart was so encrusted with worldliness and self-interest that she might as well have been without one. One day, as Paul lay quietly gazing at Aunt Lucy's benevolent face, and mentally contrasting it with that of Mrs. Mudge, whose shrill voice could be heard form below, he was seized with a sudden desire to learn something of her past history. “How long have you been here, Aunt Lucy?” he inquired. She looked up from her knitting, and sighed as she answered, “A long and weary time to look back upon, Paul. I have been here ten years.” “Ten years,” repeated Paul, thoughtfully, “and I am thirteen. So you have been here nearly all my lifetime. Has Mr.",

I'll come up with you, you may depend upon that. That's to pay for my giving you tea Sunday night, is it? Perhaps you'll get some more. It's pretty well in paupers conspiring together because they aint treated like princes and princesses.

Her kindness had produced such an impression on him, that Mrs. Mudge, by her taunts, stirred up his indignation. “She's no more of a trollop than you are,” said he, with spirit. Mrs. Mudge whirled round at this unexpected attack, and shook her fist menacingly at Paul-- “So, you've put in your oar, you little jackanapes,” said she, “If you're well enough to be impudent you're well enough to go to work.",

During that time he formed a determination which will be announced in the next chapter. At the close of the last chapter it was stated that Paul had come to a determination. This was,--TO RUN AWAY. That he had good reason for this we have already seen. He was now improving rapidly, and only waited till he was well enough to put his design into execution. “Aunt Lucy,” said he one day, “I've got something to tell you.” The old lady looked up inquiringly. “It's something I've been thinking of a long time,--at least most of the time since I've been sick. It isn't pleasant for me to stay here, and I've pretty much made up my mind that I sha'n't.” “Where will you go?” asked the old lady, dropping her work in surprise. “I don't know of any particular place, but I should be better off most anywhere than here.” “But you are so young, Paul.” “God will take care of me, Aunt Lucy,--mother used to tell me that. Besides, here I have no hope of learning anything or improving my condition.

Of all the inmates of the establishment she had felt most closely drawn to the orphan boy, whose loneliness and bereavement had appealed to her woman's heart. This feeling had been strengthened by the care she had been called to bestow upon him in his illness, for it is natural to love those whom we have benefited. But Aunt Lucy was the most unselfish of living creatures, and the idea of dissuading Paul from a course which he felt was right never occurred to her. She determined that she would do what she could to further his plans, now that he had decided to go. Accordingly she commenced knitting him a pair of stockings, knowing that this would prove a useful present. This came near being the means of discovering Paul's plan to Mrs. Mudge The latter, who notwithstanding her numerous duties, managed to see everything that was going on, had her attention directed to Aunt Lucy's work. “Have you finished the stockings that I set you to knitting for Mr. Mudge?” she asked. “No,” said Aunt Lucy, in some confusion. “Then whose are those, I should like to know?

The shadows of twilight were already upon the earth. The paupers were collected in the common room appropriated to their use. Aunt Lucy had suspended her work in consequence of the darkness, for in this economical household a lamp was considered a useless piece of extravagance. Paul crept quietly to her side, and whispered in tones audible to her alone, “I AM GOING TO-MORROW.” “To-morrow! so soon?” “Yes,” said Paul, “I am as ready now as I shall ever be.

It was an affecting sight to watch the tottering gait of those on whose heads the snows of many winters had drifted heavily, as they meekly obeyed the behest of one whose coarse nature forbade her sympathizing with them in their clouded age, and many infirmities. “Come,” said she, impatient of their slow movements, “move a little quicker, if it's perfectly convenient. Anybody'd think you'd been hard at work all day, as I have. You're about the laziest set I ever had anything to do with. I've got to be up early in the morning, and can't stay here dawdling.” “She's got a sweet temper,” said Paul, in a whisper, to Aunt Lucy. “Hush!” said the old lady. “She may hear you.” “What's that you're whispering about?” said Mrs. Mudge, suspiciously. “Something you're ashamed to have heard, most likely.” Paul thought it best to remain silent. “To-morrow morning at four!” he whispered to Aunt Lucy, as he pressed her hand in the darkness.",

There is sadness in the thought, even when the future which lies before us glows with brighter colors than the past has ever worn. But to Paul, whose future was veiled in uncertainty, and who was about to part with the only friend who felt an interest in his welfare, this thought brought increased sorrow. He stood before the dirt-begrimed window through which alone the struggling sunbeams found an inlet into the gloomy little attic, and looked wistfully out upon the barren fields that surrounded the poorhouse. Where would he be on the morrow at that time? He did not know. He knew little or nothing of the great world without, yet his resolution did not for an instant falter. If it had, the thought of Mrs. Mudge would have been enough to remove all his hesitation. He threw himself on his hard bed, and a few minutes brought him that dreamless sleep which comes so easily to the young. Meanwhile Aunt Lucy, whose thoughts were also occupied with Paul's approaching departure, had taken from the pocket of her OTHER dress--for she had but two--something wrapped in a piece of brown paper. One by one she removed the many folds in which it was enveloped, and came at length to the contents. “Paul will need some money, poor boy,” said she, softly to herself, “I will give him this. It will never do me any good, and it may be of some service to him.” So saying she looked carefully at the coin in the moonlight.",

Instead of the gold eagle, the accumulation of many years, which she had been saving for some extraordinary occasion like the presents she held in her hand--a copper cent. “I have been robbed,” she exclaimed indignantly in the suddenness of her surprise. “What's the matter now?” inquired Mrs Mudge, appearing at the door, “Why are you not in bed, Aunt Lucy Lee? How dare you disobey my orders?” “I have been robbed,” exclaimed the old lady in unwonted excitement. “Of what, pray?” asked Mrs. Mudge, with a sneer. “I had a gold eagle wrapped up in that paper,” returned Aunt Lucy, pointing to the fragments on the floor, “and now, to-night, when I come to open it, I find but this cent.” “A likely story,” retorted Mrs. Mudge, “very likely, indeed, that a common pauper should have a gold eagle. If you found a cent in the paper, most likely that's what you put there. You're growing old and forgetful, so don't get foolish and flighty. You'd better go to bed.” “But I did have the gold, and it's been stolen,” persisted Aunt Lucy, whose disappointment was the greater because she intended the money for Paul. “Again!” exclaimed Mrs. Mudge. “Will you never have done with this folly? Even if you did have the gold, which I don't for an instant believe, you couldn't keep it. A pauper has no right to hold property.” “Then why did the one who stole the little I had leave me this?” said the old lady, scornfully, holding up the cent which had been substituted for the gold.",

It was the young woman already mentioned, who was bereft of reason, but who at times, as often happens in such cases, seemed gifted with preternatural acuteness. “So you did. I saw you, I did; I saw you creep up when you thought nobody was looking, and search her pocket. You opened that paper and took out the bright yellow piece, and put in another. You didn't think I was looking at you, ha! ha! How I laughed as I stood behind the door and saw you tremble for fear some one would catch you thieving. You didn't think of me, dear, did you?” And the wild creature burst into an unmeaning laugh. Mrs. Mudge stood for a moment mute, overwhelmed by this sudden revelation. But for the darkness, Aunt Lucy could have seen the sudden flush which overspread her face with the crimson hue of detected guilt. But this was only for a moment. It was quickly succeeded by a feeling of intense anger towards the unhappy creature who had been the means of exposing her. “I'll teach you to slander your betters, you crazy fool,” she exclaimed, in a voice almost inarticulate with passion, as she seized her rudely by the arm, and dragged her violently from the room. She returned immediately. “I suppose,” said she, abruptly, confronting Aunt Lucy, “that you are fool enough to believe her ravings?” “I bring no accusation,” said the old lady, calmly, “If your conscience acquits you, it is not for me to accuse you.” “But what do you think?” persisted Mrs.",

At a quarter before four Paul started from his humble couch, and hastily dressed himself, took up a little bundle containing all his scanty stock of clothing, and noiselessly descended the two flights of stairs which separated him from the lower story. Here he paused a moment for Aunt Lucy to appear. Her sharp ears had distinguished his stealthy steps as he passed her door, and she came down to bid him good-by. She had in her hands a pair of stockings which she slipped into his bundle. “I wish I had something else to give you, Paul,” she said, “but you know that I am not very rich.” “Dear Aunt Lucy,” said Paul, kissing her, “you are my only friend on earth. You have been very kind to me, and I never will forget you, NEVER! By-and-by, when I am rich, I will build a fine house, and you will come and live with me, won't you?” Paul's bright anticipations, improbable as they were, had the effect of turning his companion's thoughts into a more cheerful channel. She bent down and kissed him, whispering softly, “Yes, I will, Paul.” “Then it's a bargain,” said he, joyously, “Mind you don't forget it. I shall come for you one of these days when you least expect it.” “Have you any money?” inquired Aunt Lucy.",

Besides, I shall not need it; God will provide for me.” “But you need not sell it,” urged Aunt Lucy, “unless it is absolutely necessary. You can take it and keep it in remembrance of me. Keep it till you see me again, Paul. It will be a pledge to me that you will come back again some day.” “On that condition I will take it,” said Paul, “and some day I will bring it back.” A slight noise above, as of some one stirring in sleep, excited the apprehensions of the two, and warned them that it was imprudent for them to remain longer in conversation. After a hurried good-by, Aunt Lucy quietly went upstairs again, and Paul, shouldering his bundle, walked rapidly away. The birds, awakening from their night's repose, were beginning to carol forth their rich songs of thanksgiving for the blessing of a new day. From the flowers beneath his feet and the blossom-laden branches above his head, a delicious perfume floated out upon the morning air, and filled the heart of the young wanderer with a sense of the joyousness of existence, and inspired him with a hopeful confidence in the future.",

Hopefully he looked forward to the time when he could fulfil his father's dying injunction, and lift from his name the burden of a debt unpaid. Then his mind reverting to another thought, he could not help smiling at the surprise and anger of Mr. Mudge, when he should find that his assistant had taken French leave. He thought he should like to be concealed somewhere where he could witness the commotion excited by his own departure. But as he could not be in two places at the same time, he must lose that satisfaction. He had cut loose from the Mudge household, as he trusted, forever. He felt that a new and brighter life was opening before him.",

He knew that it would not be long before Mr. Mudge would discover his absence, and the thought of being carried back was doubly distasteful to him now that he had, even for a short time, felt the joy of being his own master. His hurried walk, taken in the fresh morning air, gave him quite a sharp appetite. Luckily he had the means of gratifying it. The night before he had secreted half his supper, knowing that he should need it more the next morning. He thought he might now venture to sit down and eat it. At a little distance from the road was a spring, doubtless used for cattle, since it was situated at the lower end of a pasture. Close beside and bending over it was a broad, branching oak, which promised a cool and comfortable shelter. “That's just the place for me,” thought Paul, who felt thirsty as well as hungry, “I think I will take breakfast here and rest awhile before I go any farther.” So saying he leaped lightly over the rail fence, and making his way to the place indicated, sat down in the shadow of the tree. Scooping up some water in the hollow of his hand, he drank a deep and refreshing draught. He next proceeded to pull out of his pocket a small package, which proved to contain two small pieces of bread. His long morning walk had given him such an appetite that he was not long in despatching all he had.",

Nevertheless, he seemed in a fair way of putting it into practice, for the best of reasons, because he could not help it. His breakfast, though not the most inviting, being simply unbuttered bread and rather dry at that, seemed more delicious than ever before, but unfortunately there was not enough of it. However, as there seemed likely to be no more forthcoming, he concluded in default of breakfast to lie down under the tree for a few minutes before resuming his walk. Though he could not help wondering vaguely where his dinner was to come from, as that time was several hours distant, he wisely decided not to anticipate trouble till it came. Lying down under the tree, Paul began to consider what Mr. Mudge would say when he discovered that he had run away. “He'll have to milk the cows himself,” thought Paul. “He won't fancy that much. Won't Mrs. Mudge scold, thought? I'm glad I shan't be within hearing.”",

Behind them walked a boy of about his own size, flourishing a stout hickory stick. The cows went directly to the spring from which Paul had already drunk. The young driver looked at our hero with some curiosity, wondering, doubtless, what brought him there so early in the morning. After a little hesitation he said, remarking Paul's bundle, “Where are you traveling?” “I don't know exactly,” said Paul, who was not quite sure whether it would be politic to avow his destination. “Don't know?” returned the other, evidently surprised. “Not exactly; I may go to New York.” “New York! That's a great ways off. Do you know the way there?” “No, but I can find it.” “Are you going all alone?” asked his new acquaintance, who evidently thought Paul had undertaken a very formidable journey. “Are you going to walk all the way?” “Yes, unless somebody offers me a ride now and then.” “But why don't you ride in the stage, or in the cars? You would get there a good deal quicker.” “One reason,” said Paul, hesitating a little, “is because I have no money to pay for riding.” “Then how do you expect to live? Have you had any breakfast, this morning?” “I brought some with me, and just got through eating it when you came along.” “And where do you expect to get any dinner?” pursued his questioner, who was evidently not a little puzzled by the answers he received.",

He knew that his case must look a little suspicious, thus unexplained, and after a brief pause for reflection determined to take the questioner into his confidence. He did this the more readily because his new acquaintance looked very pleasant. “You've guessed right,” he said; “if you'll promise not to tell anybody, I'll tell you all about it.” This was readily promised, and the boy who gave his name as John Burgess, sat down beside Paul, while he, with the frankness of boyhood, gave a circumstantial account of his father's death, and the ill-treatment he had met with subsequently. “Do you come from Wrenville?” asked John, interested. “Why, I've got relations there. Perhaps you know my cousin, Ben Newcome.” “Is Ben Newcome your cousin? O yes, I know him very well; he's a first-rate fellow.” “He isn't much like his father.” “Not at all.

Walking must have given you a famous appetite.” John looked on with evident approbation, while Paul ate with great apparent appetite. “There,” said he with a sigh of gratification, as he swallowed the last morsel, “I haven't tasted anything so good for a long time.” “Is it as good as Mrs. Mudge's soup?” asked John, mischievously. “Almost,” returned Paul, smiling.

Now that our hero had recovered, he gladly prepared to indulge himself in an extra nap. “Paul!” called Mr. Mudge from the bottom of the staircase leading up into the attic, “it's five o'clock; time you were downstairs.” Mr. Mudge waited for an answer, but none came. “Paul!” repeated Mr. Mudge in a louder tone, “it's time to get up; tumble out there.” Again there was no answer. At first, Mr. Mudge thought it might be in consequence of Paul's sleeping so soundly, but on listening attentively, he could not distinguish the deep and regular breathing which usually accompanies such slumber. “He must be sullen,” he concluded, with a feeling of irritation. “If he is, I'll teach him----” Without taking time to finish the sentence, he bounded up the rickety staircase, and turned towards the bed with the intention of giving our hero a smart shaking. He looked with astonishment at the empty bed. “Is it possible,” he thought, “that Paul has already got up? He isn't apt to do so before he is called.” At this juncture, Mrs. Mudge, surprised at her husband's prolonged absence, called from below, “Mr. Mudge!” “What in the name of wonder keeps you up there so long?” “Just come up and see.” Mrs.",

Pale with rage, and a mortified sense of having been foiled with her own weapons, Mrs. Mudge left the room. Meanwhile her husband milked the cows, and was now occupied in performing certain other duties that could not be postponed, being resolved, immediately after breakfast was over, to harness up and pursue the runaway. “Well, did you get anything out of the old lady?” he inquired, as he came from the barn with the full milk-pails. “She said she knew beforehand that he was going.” “Eh!” said Mr. Mudge, pricking up his ears, “did she say where?” “No, and she won't. She knit him a pair of stockings to help him off, and doesn't pretend to deny it. She's taken a wonderful fancy to the young scamp, and has been as obstinate as could be ever since he has been here.” “If I get him back,” said Mr. Mudge, “he shall have a good flogging, if I am able to give him one, and she shall be present to see it.” “That's right,” said Mrs.",

Will you write to me?” Paul promised readily. “You can direct to John Burges, Burrville. The postmaster knows me, and I shall be sure to get it.” “I wish you were going with me,” said Paul. “Sometimes when I think that I am all alone it discourages me. It would be so much pleasanter to have some one with me.” “I shall come sometime,” said John, “when I am a little older. I heard father say something the other day about my going into a store in the city. So we may meet again.” They were just turning a bend of the road, when Paul chanced to look backward. About a quarter of a mile back he descried a horse and wagon wearing a familiar look. Fixing his eyes anxiously upon them, he was soon made aware that his suspicions were only too well founded. It was Mr. Mudge, doubtless in quest of him. “What shall I do?” he asked, hurriedly of his companion. This was quickly explained. John was quickwitted, and he instantly decided upon the course proper to be pursued. On either side of the road was a growth of underbrush so thick as to be almost impenetrable. “Creep in behind there, and be quick about it,” directed John, “there is no time to lose.” “There,” said he, after Paul had followed his advice, “if he can see you now he must have sharp eyes.” “Won't you come in too?” “Not I,” said John, “I am anxious to see this Mr. Mudge, since you have told me so much about him. I hope he will ask me some questions.” “What will you tell him?” “Trust me for that. Don't say any more. He's close by.”",

He purposely kept in the middle of the road, apparently quite unaware of the approach of the vehicle, until he was aroused by the sound of a voice behind him. “Be a little more careful, if you don't want to get run over.” John assumed a look of surprise, and with comic terror ran to the side of the road. Mr. Mudge checked his horse, and came to a sudden halt. “I say, youngster, haven't you seen a boy of about your own size walking along, with a bundle in his hand?” “Tied up in a red cotton handkerchief?” inquired John. “Yes, I believe so,” said Mr. Mudge, eagerly, “where did you----” “With a blue cloth cap?” “Gray jacket and pants?” “With a patch on one knee?” “Yes, the very one. When did you see him?” said Mr. Mudge, getting ready to start his horse. “Perhaps it isn't the one you mean,” continued John, who took a mischievous delight in playing with the evident impatience of Mr. Mudge; “the boy that I saw looked thin, as if he hadn't had enough to eat.” Mr. Mudge winced slightly, and looked at John with some suspicion. But John put on so innocent and artless a look that Mr. Mudge at once dismissed the idea that there was any covert meaning in what he said. Meanwhile Paul, from his hiding-place in the bushes, had listened with anxiety to the foregoing colloquy.",

In his own singleness of heart he could not believe such duplicity possible. Still, it was not without anxiety that he waited to hear what would be said next. “Well,” said Mr. Mudge, slowly, “I don't know but he is a little PEAKED. He's been sick lately, and that's took off his flesh.” “Was he your son?” asked John, in a sympathizing tone; “you must feel quite troubled about him.” He looked askance at Mr. Mudge, enjoying that gentleman's growing irritation. “My son? No. Where----” “Nephews perhaps?” suggested the imperturbable John, leisurely continuing the manufacture of a whistle. “No, I tell you, nothing of the kind.

I am in pursuit of him.” “Has he run away?” inquired John in assumed surprise. “Are you going to answer my question or not?” demanded Mr. Mudge, angrily. “Oh, I beg your pardon. I shouldn't have asked so many questions, only I thought he was a nice-looking boy, and I felt interested in him.” “He's a young scamp,” said Mr. Mudge, impetuously, “and it's my belief that you're another. Now answer my question. When and where did you see this boy?” This time Mr. Mudge's menacing look warned John that he had gone far enough. Accordingly he answered promptly, “He passed by our farm this morning.” “How far back is that?”",

Occasionally he cast a glance backwards, to make sure that Mr. Mudge was not following him. But Paul had no cause to fear on that score. The object of his dread was already some miles distant in a different direction. For an hour longer, Paul trudged on. He met few persons, the road not being very much frequented. He was now at least twelve miles from his starting-place, and began to feel very sensibly the effects of heat and fatigue combined. He threw himself down upon the grass under the overhanging branches of an appletree to rest. After his long walk repose seemed delicious, and with a feeling of exquisite enjoyment he stretched himself out at full length upon the soft turf, and closed his eyes. Insensibly he fell asleep. How long he slept he could not tell. He was finally roused from his slumber by something cold touching his cheek. Starting up he rubbed his eyes in bewilderment, and gradually became aware that this something was the nose of a Newfoundland dog, whose keen scent had enabled him to discover the whereabouts of the small stock of provisions with which Paul had been supplied by his late companion.",

He was seated on a cart liberally stocked with articles of tin ware. From the rear depended two immense bags, one of which served as a receptacle for white rags, the other for bits of calico and whatever else may fall under the designation of “colored.” His shop, for such it was, was drawn at a brisk pace by a stout horse, who in this respect presented a contrast to his master, who was long and lank. The pedler himself was a man of perhaps forty, with a face in which shrewdness and good humor seemed alike indicated. Take him for all in all, you might travel some distance without falling in with a more complete specimen of the Yankee. “So you came nigh losing your dinner,” he repeated, in a pleasant tone. “Yes,” said Paul, “I got tired and fell asleep, and I don't know when I should have waked up but for your dog.” “Yes, Boney's got a keen scent for provisions,” laughed the pedler. “He's a little graspin', like his namesake.

Paul felt a little embarrassed. If he had been acquainted with the names of any of the villages on the route he might easily have answered. As it was, only one name occurred to him. “I think,” said he, with some hesitation, “that I shall go to New York.” “New York!” repeated the pedler, with a whistle expressive of his astonishment. “Well, you've a journey before you.

Where did you live?” “If I tell you, you won't carry me back?” said Paul, anxiously. “Not a bit of it.

I've got a story to tell you about Mrs. Mudge. She's a regular skinflint.” This was the pedler's promised story about Mrs. Mudge. “The last time I was round that way, I stopped, thinking maybe they might have some rags to dispose of for tin-ware. The old lady seemed glad to see me, and pretty soon she brought down a lot of white rags. I thought they seemed quite heavy for their bulk,--howsomever, I wasn't looking for any tricks, and I let it go. By-and-by, when I happened to be ransacking one of the bags, I came across half a dozen pounds or more of old iron tied up in a white cloth. That let the cat out of the bag.

The unsophisticated reader is informed that the word “bait,” in New England phraseology, is applied to taking lunch or dining. At this point a green lane opened out of the public road, skirted on either side by a row of trees. Carpeted with green, it made a very pleasant dining-room. A red-and-white heifer browsing at a little distance looked up from her meal and surveyed the intruders with mild attention, but apparently satisfied that they contemplated no invasion of her rights, resumed her agreeable employment. Over an irregular stone wall our travelers looked into a thrifty apple-orchard laden with fruit.

Help yourself to the doughnuts. I always calc'late to have some with me. I'd give more for 'em any day than for rich cake that ain't fit for anybody. My mother used to beat everybody in the neighborhood on making doughnuts. She made 'em so good that we never knew when to stop eating. You wouldn't hardly believe it, but, when I was a little shaver, I remember eating twenty-three doughnuts at one time.

With a little assistance from Paul, the stock of doughnuts on which he had been lavishing encomiums, diminished rapidly. It was evident that his attachment to this homely article of diet was quite as strong as ever. “Don't be afraid of them,” said he, seeing that Paul desisted from his efforts, “I've got plenty more in the box.” Paul signified that his appetite was already appeased.",

Couldn't I sell you something?” “Not a single thing,” said she, preparing to shut the door; but Daniel, knowing all would then be lost, stepped in before she could shut it quite to, and began to name over some of the articles he had in his wagon. “You may talk till doomsday,” said the widow, as mad as could be, “and it won't do a particle of good. Now, you've got your answer, and you'd better leave the house before you are driven out.” “Brooms, brushes, lamps----” “Here the widow, who had been trying to keep in her anger, couldn't hold out any longer. She seized the broom she had been sweeping with, and brought it down with a tremendous whack upon Daniel's back. You can imagine how hard it was, when I tell you that the force of the blow snapped the broom in the middle. You might have thought Daniel would resent it, but he didn't appear to notice it, though it must have hurt him awful.",

I've got some capital ones out in the cart.'” “The widow seemed kind of overpowered by his coolness. She hardly knew what to say or what to think. However, she had broken her old broom, that was certain, and must have a new one; so when Daniel ran out and brought in a bundle of them, she picked out one and paid for it without saying a word; only, when Daniel asked if he might have the pleasure of calling again, she looked a little queer, and told him that if he considered it a pleasure, she had no objection.” “And did he call again?” “Yes, whenever he went that way. The widow was always very polite to him after that, and, though she had a mortal dislike to pedlers in general, she was always ready to trade with him. Daniel used to say that he gained his bet and the widow's custom at ONE BLOW.” They were now descending a little hill at the foot of which stood a country tavern. Here Mr. Stubbs declared his intention of spending the night. He drove into the barn, the large door of which stood invitingly open, and unharnessed his horse, taking especial care to rub him down and set before him an ample supply of provender. “I always take care of Goliah myself,” said he. “He's a good friend to me, and it's no more than right that I should take good care of him. Now, we'll go into the house, and see what we can get for supper.” He was surprised to see that Paul hung back, and seemed disinclined to follow.",

I'm about as hungry as a bear, and I guess you are too.” Before many minutes, Paul sat down to a more bountiful repast than he had partaken of for many a day. There were warm biscuits and fresh butter, such as might please the palate of an epicure, while at the other end of the table was a plate of cake, flanked on one side by an apple-pie, on the other by one of pumpkin, with its rich golden hue, such as is to be found in its perfection, only in New England. It will scarcely be doubted that our hungry travellers did full justice to the fare set before them. When they had finished, they went into the public room, where were engaged some of the village worthies, intent on discussing the news and the political questions of the day. It was a time of considerable political excitement, and this naturally supplied the topic of conversation. In this the pedler joined, for his frequent travel on this route had made him familiarly acquainted with many of those present. Paul sat in a corner, trying to feel interested in the conversation; but the day had been a long one, and he had undergone an unusual amount of fatigue. Gradually, his drowsiness increased.",

It was the second morning since Paul's departure. Already a sense of freedom gave his spirits unwonted elasticity, and encouraged him to hope for the best. Had his knowledge of the future been greater, his confidence might have been less. But would he have been any happier? So many miles separated him from his late home, that he supposed himself quite safe from detection. A slight circumstance warned him that he must still be watchful and cautious. As they were jogging easily along, they heard the noise of wheels at a little distance. Paul looked up. To his great alarms he recognized in the driver of the approaching vehicle, one of the selectmen of Wrenville. “What's the matter?” asked his companion, noticing his sudden look of apprehension. Paul quickly communicated the ground of his alarm. “And you are afraid he will want to carry you back, are you?”",

The selectman was already within a hundred rods. He had not yet apparently noticed the pedler's cart, so that this was in our hero's favor. Mr. Stubbs had already arranged his plan of operations. “This is what you are to do, Paul,” said he, quickly. “Cock your hat on the side of your head, considerably forward, so that he can't see much of your face. Then here's a cigar to stick in your mouth. You can make believe that you are smoking. If you are the sort of boy I reckon you are, he'll never think it's you.” Paul instantly adopted this suggestion. Slipping his hat to one side in the jaunty manner characteristic of young America, he began to puff very gravely at a cigar the pedler handed him, frequently taking it from his mouth, as he had seen older persons do, to knock away the ashes. Nothwithstanding his alarm, his love of fun made him enjoy this little stratagem, in which he bore his part successfully. The selectman eyed him intently. Paul began to tremble from fear of discovery, but his apprehensions were speedily dissipated by a remark of the new-comer, “My boy, you are forming a very bad habit.” Paul did not dare to answer lest his voice should betray him. To his relief, the pedler spoke---- “Just what I tell him, sir, but I suppose he thinks he must do as his father does.” By this time the vehicles had passed each other, and the immediate peril was over.",

Shouldn't wonder if he'd let us stop over Sunday. Whoa, Goliah, glad to get home, hey?” as the horse pricked up his ears and showed manifest signs of satisfaction. “Now, youngster, follow me, and I guess I can promise you some supper, if Mrs. Stubbs hasn't forgotten her old tricks.” They passed through the entry into the kitchen, where Mrs. Stubbs was discovered before the fire toasting slices of bread. “Lor, Jehoshaphat,” said she, “I didn't expect you so soon,” and she looked inquiringly at his companion. “A young friend who is going to stay with us till Monday,” explained the pedler. “His name is Paul Prescott.” “I'm glad to see you, Paul,” said Mrs. Stubbs with a friendly smile. “You must be tired if you've been traveling far. Take a seat. Here's a rocking-chair for you.” This friendly greeting made Paul feel quite at home. Having no children, the pedler and his wife exerted themselves to make the time pass pleasantly to their young acquaintance. Paul could not help contrasting them with Mr. and Mrs. Mudge, not very much to the advantage of the latter. On Sunday he went to church with them, and the peculiar circumstances in which he was placed, made him listen to the sermon with unusual attention.",

On Monday morning Paul resumed his journey, with an ample stock of provisions supplied by Mrs. Stubbs, in the list of which doughnuts occupied a prominent place; this being at the particular suggestion of Mr. Stubbs. Forty or fifty miles remained to be traversed before his destination would be reached. The road was not a difficult one to find, and he made it out without much questioning. The first night, he sought permission to sleep in a barn. He met with a decided refusal. He was about to turn away in disappointment, when he was called back. “You are a little too fast, youngster. I said I wouldn't let you sleep in my barn, and I won't; but I've got a spare bed in the house, and if you choose you shall occupy it.” Under the guise of roughness, this man had a kind heart. He inquired into the particulars of Paul's story, and at the conclusion terrified him by saying that he had been very foolish and ought to be sent back. Nevertheless, when Paul took leave of him the next morning, he did not go away empty-handed. “If you must be so foolish as to set up for yourself, take this,” said the farmer, placing half a dollar in his hand.",

He climbed up into a high tree, which, having the benefit of an elevated situation, afforded him an extensive prospect. Before him lay the great city of which he had so often heard, teeming with life and activity. Half in eager anticipation, half in awe and wonder at its vastness, our young pilgrim stood upon the threshold of this great Babel. Everything looked new and strange. It had never entered Paul's mind, that there could be so many houses in the whole State as now rose up before him. He got into Broadway, and walked on and on thinking that the street must end somewhere. But the farther he walked the thicker the houses seemed crowded together. Every few rods, too, he came to a cross street, which seemed quite as densely peopled as the one on which he was walking. One part of the city was the same as another to Paul, since he was equally a stranger to all. He wandered listlessly along, whither fancy led. His mind was constantly excited by the new and strange objects which met him at every step. As he was looking in at a shop window, a boy of about his own age, stopped and inquired confidentially, “when did you come from the country?” “This morning,” said Paul, wondering how a stranger should know that he was a country boy.",

Everybody seemed to be in a hurry, pressing forward as if life and death depended on his haste. There were lawyers with their sharp, keen glances; merchants with calculating faces; speculators pondering on the chances of a rise or fall in stocks; errand boys with bundles under their arms; business men hurrying to the slip to take the boat for Brooklyn or Jersey City,--all seemed intent on business of some kind, even to the ragged newsboys who had just obtained their supply of evening papers, and were now crying them at the top of their voices,--and very discordant ones at that, so Paul thought. Of the hundreds passing and repassing before him, every one had something to do.",

He probably saw something in Paul which attracted him, for he stepped up and extending his hand, said, “why, Tom, how came you here?” “My name isn't Tom,” said Paul, feeling a little puzzled by this address. “Why, so it isn't. But you look just like my friend, Tom Crocker.” To this succeeded a few inquiries, which Paul unsuspiciously answered. “Do you like oysters?” inquired the new-comer, after a while.",

How jolly queer you are!” He meant to say green, but had a purpose in not offending Paul. “Are you the Governor's son?” asked Paul in amazement. “To be sure,” carelessly replied the other. Paul's wonder had been excited many times in the course of the day, but this was more surprising than anything which had yet befallen him. That he should have the luck to fall in with the son of the Governor, on his first arrival in the city, and that the latter should prove so affable and condescending, was indeed surprising. Paul inwardly determined to mention it in his first letter to Aunt Lucy. He could imagine her astonishment. While he was busy with these thoughts, his companion had finished his oysters. “Most through?” he inquired nonchalantly. “I've got to step out a minute; wait till I come back.” Paul unsuspectingly assented.",

You don't suppose I give 'em away, do you?” “I thought,” hesitated Paul, “that the one who was with me paid,--the Governor's son,” he added, conscious of a certain pride in his intimacy with one so nearly related to the chief magistrate of the Commonwealth. “The Governor's son,” laughed the barkeeper. “Why the Governor lives a hundred miles off and more. That wasn't the Governor's son any more than I am.” “He called his father governor,” said Paul, beginning to be afraid that he had made some ridiculous blunder. “Well, I wouldn't advise you to trust him again, even if he's the President's son. He only got you in here to pay for his oysters. He told me when he went out that you would pay for them.” “And didn't he say he was coming back?” asked Paul, quite dumbfounded. “He said you hadn't quite finished, but would pay for both when you came out. It's two shillings.” Paul rather ruefully took out the half dollar which constituted his entire stock of money, and tendered it to the barkeeper who returned him the change.

It was so in Paul's case, and although he had as yet had no idea where he should find shelter for the night he did not allow that consideration to trouble him. So the day passed, and the evening came on. Paul's appetite returned to him once more. He invested one-half of his money at an old woman's stall for cakes and apples, and then he ate leisurely while leaning against the iron railing which encircles the park. He began to watch with interest the movements of those about him. Already the lamplighter had started on his accustomed round, and with ladder in hand was making his way from one lamp-post to another. Paul quite marvelled at the celerity with which the lamps were lighted, never before having witnessed the use of gas. He was so much interested in the process that he sauntered along behind the lamplighter for some time. At length his eye fell upon a group common enough in our cities, but new to him. An Italian, short and dark-featured, with a velvet cap, was grinding out music from a hand-organ, while a woman with a complexion equally dark, and black sorrowful-looking eyes, accompanied her husband on the tambourine.",

Next, he came to a place of public amusement. Crowds were entering constantly, and Paul, from curiosity, entered too. He passed on to a little wicket, when a man stopped him. “Where's your ticket?” he asked. “I haven't got any,” said Paul. “Then what business have you here?” said the man, roughly. “Isn't this a meeting-house?” asked Paul. This remark seemed to amuse two boys who were standing by. Looking up with some indignation, Paul recognized in one of them the boy who had cheated him out of the oysters. “Look here,” said Paul, “what made you go off and leave me to pay for the oysters this morning?” “Which of us do you mean?” inquired the 'governor's son,' carelessly.",

Soon he came to another building, which was in like manner lighted up, but not so brilliantly as the theater. This time, from the appearance of the building, and from the tall steeple,--so tall that his eye could scarcely reach the tapering spire,--he knew that it must be a church. There was not such a crowd gathered about the door as at the place he had just left, but he saw a few persons entering, and he joined them. The interior of the church was far more gorgeous than the plain village meeting-house which he had been accustomed to attend with his mother.",

But in a moment memory came to his aid, and he recalled the events of the preceding day, and saw that he must have been locked up in the church. “How am I going to get out?” Paul asked himself in dismay. This was the important question just now. He remembered that the village meeting-house which he had been accustomed to attend was rarely opened except on Sundays. What if this should be the case here? It was Thursday morning, and three days must elapse before his release. This would never do. He must seek some earlier mode of deliverance.

Have you no home?” asked the sexton in surprise. “Where should you have slept if you hadn't come in here?” “I don't know, I'm sure.” “And I suppose you don't know where you shall sleep to-night?” Paul signified that he did not. “I knew there were plenty of such cases,” said the sexton, meditatively; “but I never seemed to realize it before.” “How long have you been in New York?” was his next inquiry. “Not very long,” said Paul. “I only got here yesterday.” “Then you don't know anybody in the city?” “Why did you come here, then?” “Because I wanted to go somewhere where I could earn a living, and I thought I might find something to do here.” “But suppose you shouldn't find anything to do?” “I don't know,” said Paul, slowly. “I haven't thought much about that.” “Well, my lad,” said the sexton, not unkindly, “I can't say your prospects look very bright. You should have good reasons for entering on such an undertaking. I--I don't think you are a bad boy. You don't look like a bad one,” he added, half to himself. “I hope not, sir,” said Paul. “I hope not, too. I was going to say that I wish I could help you to some kind of work. If you will come home with me, you shall be welcome to a dinner, and perhaps I may be able to think of something for you.” Paul gladly prepared to follow his new acquaintance. “What is your name?” inquired the sexton.",

Poor boy! you are indeed poor.” “But I can work,” said Paul, spiritedly. “I ought to be able to earn my living.” “Yes, yes, that's the way to feel. Heaven helps those who help themselves.” When they were fairly out of the church, Paul had an opportunity of observing his companion's external appearance. He was an elderly man, with harsh features, which would have been forbidding, but for a certain air of benevolence which softened their expression. As Paul walked along, he related, with less of detail, the story which is already known to the reader. The sexton said little except in the way of questions designed to elicit further particulars, till, at the conclusion he said, “Must tell Hester.” At length they came to a small house, in a respectable but not fashionable quarter of the city. One-half of this was occupied by the sexton. He opened the door and led the way into the sitting-room. It was plainly but neatly furnished, the only ornament being one or two engravings cheaply framed and hung over the mantel-piece. They were by no means gems of art, but then, the sexton did not claim to be a connoisseur, and would probably not have understood the meaning of the word. “Sit here a moment,” said the sexton, pointing to a chair, “I'll go and speak to Hester.” Paul whiled away the time in looking at the pictures in a copy of “The Pilgrim's Progress,” which lay on the table.",

Hers was one of the faces on which nature has written PLAIN, in unmistakable characters. Yet if the outward features had been a reflex of the soul within, few faces would have been more attractive than that of Hester Cameron. At the feet of the sexton's wife, for such she was, reposed a maltese cat, purring softly by way of showing her contentment. Indeed, she had good reason to be satisfied. In default of children, puss had become a privileged pet, being well fed and carefully shielded from all the perils that beset cat-hood. “Home so soon?” said Hester inquiringly, as her husband opened the door. “Yes, Hester, and I have brought company with me,” said the sexton. “Company!” repeated his wife. “Who is it?” “It is a poor boy, who was accidentally locked up in the church last night.” “And he had to stay there all night?” “Yes; but perhaps it was lucky for him, for he had no other place to sleep, and not money enough to pay for one.” “Poor child!” said Hester, compassionately. “Is it not terrible to think that any human creature should be without the comforts of a home which even our tabby possesses. It ought to make you thankful that you are so well cared for, Tab.” The cat opened her eyes and winked drowsily at her mistress. “So you brought the poor boy home, Hugh?” “Yes, Hester,--I thought we ought not to begrudge a meal to one less favored by fortune than ourselves. You know we should consider ourselves the almoners of God's bounties.”",

But she so far entered into his feelings, that she determined to expend her utmost skill as cook upon the dinner, that Paul might have at least one good meal. “Now I will bring the boy in,” said he. “I am obliged to go to work, but you will find some way to entertain him, I dare say.” “If you will come out (this he said to Paul), I will introduce you to a new friend.” Paul was kindly welcomed by the sexton's wife, who questioned him in a sympathizing tone about his enforced stay in the church. To all her questions Paul answered in a modest yet manly fashion, so as to produce a decidedly favorable impression upon his entertainer. Our hero was a handsome boy. Just at present he was somewhat thin, not having entirely recovered from the effects of his sickness and poor fare while a member of Mr. Mudge's family; but he was well made, and bade fair to become a stout boy. His manner was free and unembarrassed, and he carried a letter of recommendation in his face. It must be admitted, however that there were two points in which his appearance might have been improved. Both his hands and face had suffered from the dust of travel.",

She quietly got some water and a towel, and requested Paul to pull off his jacket, which she dusted while he was performing his ablutions. Then, with the help of a comb to arrange his disordered hair, he seemed quite like a new boy, and felt quite refreshed by the operation. “Really, it improves him very much,” said Hester to herself. She couldn't help recalling a boy of her own,--the only child she ever had,--who had been accidentally drowned when about the age of Paul. “If he had only lived,” she thought, “how different might have been our lives.” A thought came into her mind, and she looked earnestly at Paul. “I--yes I will speak to Hugh about it,” she said, speaking aloud, unconsciously. “Did you speak to me?” asked Paul. “No,--I was thinking of something.” She observed that Paul was looking rather wistfully at a loaf of bread on the table. “Don't you feel hungry?” she asked, kindly. “I dare say you have had no breakfast.” “I have eaten nothing since yesterday afternoon.” “Bless my soul! How hungry you must be!” said the good woman, as she bustled about to get a plate of butter and a knife. She must have been convinced of it by the rapid manner in which the slices of bread and butter disappeared. At one o'clock the sexton came home.

Do you consent?” “Consent!” echoed Paul in joyful surprise. “How can I ever repay your kindness?” “If you are the boy we take you for, we shall feel abundantly repaid. Hester, we can give Paul the little bedroom where--where John used to sleep.” His voice faltered a little, for John was the name of his boy, who had been drowned. Paul found the sexton's dwelling very different from his last home, if the Poorhouse under the charge of Mr. and Mrs. Mudge deserved such a name. His present home was an humble one, but he was provided with every needful comfort, and the atmosphere of kindness which surrounded him, gave him a feeling of peace and happiness which he had not enjoyed for a long time. Paul supposed that he would be at once set to work, and even then would have accounted himself fortunate in possessing such a home. But Mr. Cameron had other views for him. “Are you fond of studying?” asked the sexton, as they were all three gathered in the little sitting room, an evening or two after Paul first came. “Very much!” replied our hero. “And would you like to go to school?” “What, here in New York?”",

And though you are not my son, Paul, Providence has in a manner conducted you to me, and I feel responsible for your future. So you shall go to school next Monday morning, and I hope you will do yourself much credit there.” “Thank you very much,” said Paul. “I feel very grateful, but----” “You surely are not going to object?” said the sexton. “Well, Paul, go on,” seeing that the boy hesitated. “Why,” said our hero, with a sense of delicacy which did him credit, “If I go to school, I shall not be able to earn my board, and shall be living at your expense, though I have no claim upon you.” “Oh, is that all?” said the sexton cheerfully, “I was afraid that it was something more serious. As to that, I am not rich, and never expect to be. But what little expense you will be will not ruin me. Besides, when you are grown up and doing well, you can repay me, if I ever need it.” “That I will,” said Paul. “Mind, if I ever need it,--not otherwise. There, now, it's a bargain on that condition. You haven't any other objection,” seeing that Paul still hesitated. “No, or at least I should like to ask your advice,” said Paul. “Just before my father died, he told me of a debt of five hundred dollars which he had not been able to pay.",

I don't know but I ought to go to work so as to keep my promise.” “No,” said the sexton after a moment's reflection, “the best course will be to go to school, at present. Knowledge is power, and a good education will help you to make money by and by. I approve your resolution, my lad, and if you keep it resolutely in mind I have no doubt you will accomplish your object. But the quickest road to success is through the schoolroom. At present you are not able to earn much. Two or three years hence will be time enough.” Paul's face brightened as the sexton said this. He instinctively felt that Mr. Cameron was right. He had never forgotten his father's dying injunction, and this was one reason that impelled him to run away from the Almshouse, because he felt that while he remained he never would be in a situation to carry out his father's wishes. Now his duty was reconciled with his pleasure, and he gratefully accepted the sexton's suggestions. The next Monday morning, in accordance with the arrangement which had just been agreed upon, Paul repaired to school. He was at once placed in a class, and lessons were assigned him. At first his progress was not rapid. While living in Wrenville he had an opportunity only of attending a country school, kept less than six months in the year, and then not affording advantages to be compared with those of a city school.",

Therefore it was that Paul lagged behind his class. There are generally some in every school, who are disposed to take unfair advantage of their schoolmates, or to ridicule those whom they consider inferior to themselves. There was one such in Paul's class. His name was George Dawkins. He was rather a showy boy, and learned easily. He might have stood a class above where he was, if he had not been lazy, and depended too much on his natural talent. As it was, he maintained the foremost rank in his class. “Better be the first man in a village than the second man in Rome,” he used to say; and as his present position not only gave him the pre-eminence which he desired, but cost him very little exertion to maintain, he was quite well satisfied with it. This boy stood first in his class, while Paul entered at the foot. He laughed unmercifully at the frequent mistakes of our hero, and jeeringly dubbed him, “Young Stupid.” “Do you know what Dawkins calls you?” asked one of the boys. “No. What does he call me?” asked Paul, seriously. “He calls you 'Young Stupid.'” Paul's face flushed painfully. Ridicule was as painful to him as it is to most boys, and he felt the insult deeply. “I'd fight him if I were you,” was the volunteered advice of his informant.",

It occasioned him considerable amusement. “Halloa, Young Stupid,” he called out, at recess. “Why don't you answer when you are spoken to?” he asked angrily. “When you call me by my right name,” said Paul, quietly, “I will answer, and not before.” “You're mighty independent,” sneered Dawkins. “I don't know but I may have to teach you manners.” “You had better wait till you are qualified,” said Paul, coolly. Dawkins approached our hero menacingly, but Paul did not look in the least alarmed, and he concluded to attack him with words only. “I understand you have set yourself up as my rival!” he said, mockingly. “Not just yet,” said Paul, “but in time I expect to be.” “So you expect my place,” said Dawkins, glancing about him. “We'll talk about that three months hence,” said Paul. “Don't hurt yourself studying,” sneered Dawkins, scornfully.

She was a driving, bustling woman, and, whatever might be her faults of temper, she was at least industrious and energetic. Had Mr. Mudge been equally so, they would have been better off in a worldly point of view. But her husband was constitutionally lazy, and was never disposed to do more than was needful. Mrs. Mudge was in a bad humor that morning. One of the cows had got into the garden through a gap in the fence, and made sad havoc among the cabbages. Now if Mrs. Mudge had a weakness, it was for cabbages. She was excessively fond of them, and had persuaded her husband to set out a large number of plants from which she expected a large crop.",

Leaping over the broken fence, she had just cleared the gap as the broom-handle, missing her, came forcibly down upon the rail, and was snapped in sunder by the blow. Here was a new vexation. Brindle had not only escaped scot-free, but the broom, a new one, bought only the week before, was broken. “It's a plaguy shame,” said Mrs. Mudge, angrily. “There's my best broom broken; cost forty-two cents only last week.” She turned and contemplated the scene of devastation. This yielded her little consolation. “At least thirty cabbages destroyed by that scamp of a cow,” she exclaimed in a tone bordering on despair. “I wish I'd a hit her.

I believe I will knock again.” This time he knocked with his cane. Rat-tat-tat sounded on the door. The echo had not died away, when the door was pulled suddenly open, and a dipper full of hot suds was dashed into the face of the astonished Squire, accompanied with, “Take that, you young scamp!” “Wh--what does all this mean?” gasped Squire Newcome, nearly strangled with the suds, a part of which had found its way into his mouth. “I beg your pardon, Squire Newcome,” said the horrified Mrs. Mudge. “I didn't mean it.” “What did you mean, then?” demanded Squire Newcome, sternly. “I think you addressed me,--ahem!--as a scamp.” “Oh, I didn't mean you,” said Mrs. Mudge, almost out of her wits with perplexity. “Come in, sir, and let me give you a towel. You've no idea how I've been tried this morning.” “I trust,” said the Squire, in his stateliest tone, “you will be able to give a satisfactory explanation of this, ahem--extraordinary proceeding.” While Mrs. Mudge was endeavoring to sooth the ruffled dignity of the aggrieved Squire, the “young scamp,” who had caused all the mischief, made his escape through the fields.",

Mrs. Mudge has got herself into a scrape, now, I'm thinking.” Having attained a safe distance from the Poorhouse, Ben doubled himself up and rolled over and over upon the grass, convulsed with laughter. “I'd give five dollars to see it all over again,” he said to himself. “I never had such splendid fun in my life.” Presently the Squire emerged, his tall dicky looking decidedly limp and drooping, his face expressing annoyance and outraged dignity. Mrs. Mudge attended him to the door with an expression of anxious concern. “I guess I'd better make tracks,” said Ben to himself, “it won't do for the old gentleman to see me here, or he may smell a rat.” He accordingly scrambled over a stone wall and lay quietly hidden behind it till he judged it would be safe to make his appearance.",

I repeat; was you a doing anything to him?” Ben shifted from one foot to the other, and looked out of the window. “I desire a categorical answer,” said Squire Newcome. “Don't know what categorical means,” said Ben, assuming a perplexed look. “I desire you to answer me IMMEGIATELY,” explained the Squire. “What was you a doing to Watch?” “I was tying a tin-kettle to his tail,” said Ben, a little reluctantly. “And what was you a doing that for?” pursued the Squire. “I wanted to see how he would look,” said Ben, glancing demurely at his father, out of the corner of his eye. “Did it ever occur to you that it must be disagreeable to Watch to have such an appendage to his tail?” queried the Squire. “I don't know,” said Ben. “How should you like to have a tin pail suspended to your--ahem! your coat tail?” “I haven't got any coat tail,” said Ben, “I wear jackets. But I think I am old enough to wear coats. Can't I have one made, father?” “Ahem!” said the Squire, blowing his nose, “we will speak of that at some future period.” “Fred Newell wears a coat, and he isn't any older than I am,” persisted Ben, who was desirous of interrupting his father's inquiries.",

The driver looked towards Ben, and inquired, “Boy, is this the way to Sparta?” Ben, who was walking leisurely along the path, whistling as he went, never turned his head. “Are you deaf, boy?” said the driver, impatiently. “I want to know if this is the road to Sparta?” “Fine morning, sir,” he said politely. “I know that well enough without your telling me. Will you tell me whether this is the road to Sparta?” Ben put his hand to his ear, and seemed to listen attentively. Then he slowly shook his head, and said, “Would you be kind enough to speak a little louder, sir?” “The boy is deaf, after all,” said the driver to himself. “IS THIS THE ROAD TO SPARTA?” “Yes, sir, this is Wrenville,” said Ben, politely. “Plague take it! he don't hear me yet. IS THIS THE ROAD TO SPARTA?” “Just a little louder, if you please,” said Ben, keeping his hand to his ear, and appearing anxious to hear. “Deaf as a post!” muttered the driver. “I couldn't scream any louder, if I should try. Go along.” “Poor man! I hope he hasn't injured his voice,” thought Ben, his eyes dancing with fun. “By gracious!” he continued a moment later, bursting into a laugh, “if he isn't going to ask the way of old Tom Haven. He's as deaf as I pretended to be.” The driver had reined up again, and inquired the way to Sparta.",

Post-marked at New York, too. I didn't know you had any correspondents there.” “It's probably from the Mayor of New York,” said Ben, in a tone of comical importance, “asking my advice about laying out Central Park.” “Probably it is,” said the postmaster. “It's a pretty thick letter,--looks like an official document.” By this time, Ben, who was really surprised by the reception of the letter, had opened it.",

I wish I had time to tell all the adventures I met with on the way, but I must wait till I see you. When I got to the city, I was astonished to find how large it was. The first day I got pretty tired wandering about, and strayed into a church in the evening, not knowing where else to go. I was so tired I fell asleep there, and didn't wake up till morning. When I found myself locked up in a great church, I was frightened, I can tell you. It was only Thursday morning, and I was afraid I should have to stay there till Sunday. If I had, I am afraid I should have starved to death. But, fortunately for me, the sexton came in the morning, and let me out. That wasn't all. He very kindly took me home with him, and then told me I might live with him and go to school. I like him very much, and his wife too. I call them Uncle Hugh and Aunt Hester. When you write to me, you must direct to the care of Mr. Hugh Cameron, 10 R---- Street. Then it will be sure to reach me. I am going to one of the city schools. At first, I was a good deal troubled because I was so far behind boys of my age. You know I hadn't been to school for a long time before I left Wrenville, on account of father's sickness.",

He studied better than usual, and proved in truth a formidable rival. But Paul's spirit was roused. He resolved to maintain his position if possible. He had now become accustomed to study, and it cost him less effort. When the end of the month came, there was considerable speculation in the minds of the boys as to the result of the rivalry. The majority had faith in Paul, but there were some who, remembering how long Dawkins had been at the head of the class, thought he would easily regain his lost rank. The eventful day, the first of the month, at length came, and the class-list was read. Paul Prescott ranked first. George Dawkins ranked second. A flush spread over the pale face of Dawkins, and he darted a malignant glance at Paul, who was naturally pleased at having retained his rank. Dawkins had his satellites. One of these came to him at recess, and expressed his regret that Dawkins had failed of success. Dawkins repelled the sympathy with cold disdain. “What do you suppose I care for the head of the class?” he demanded, haughtily. “I thought you had been studying for it.” “Then you thought wrong. Let the sexton's son have it, if he wants it. It would be of no use to me, as I leave this school at the end of the week.” The boys gathered about Dawkins, curiously.",

My father does not wish me to attend a public school any longer.” This statement was made on the spur of the moment, to cover the mortification which his defeat had occasioned him. It proved true, however. On his return home, Dawkins succeeded in persuading his father to transfer him to a private school, and he took away his books at the end of the week. Had he recovered his lost rank there is no doubt that he would have remained. Truth to tell, there were few who mourned much for the departure of George Dawkins. He had never been a favorite. His imperious temper and arrogance rendered this impossible. After he left school, Paul saw little of him for two or three years. At their first encounter Paul bowed and spoke pleasantly, but Dawkins looked superciliously at him without appearing to know him. Paul's face flushed proudly, and afterwards he abstained from making advances which were likely to be repulsed. He had too much self-respect to submit voluntarily to such slights. Meanwhile Paul's school life fled rapidly. It was a happy time,--happy in its freedom from care, and happy for him, though all school boys do not appreciate that consideration, in the opportunities for improvement which it afforded. These opportunities, it is only just to Paul to say, were fully improved.",

Paul was now very desirous of procuring a situation. He felt that it was time he was doing something for himself.

Never for a moment had Paul forgotten it. Never for a moment had he faltered in his determination to liquidate it at whatever sacrifice to himself. “My father's name shall be cleared,” he said to himself, proudly. “Neither Squire Conant nor any one else shall have it in his power to cast reproach upon his memory.” The sexton applauded his purpose. “You are quite right, Paul,” he said. “But you need not feel in haste. Obtain your education first, and the money will come by-and-by. As long as you repay the amount, principal and interest, you will have done all that you are in honor bound to do. Squire Conant, as I understand from you, is a rich man, so that he will experience no hardship in waiting.” Paul was now solicitous about a place.",

There appeared to be six or eight clerks in attendance upon quite a respectable number of customers. “Is Mr. Smith in?” inquired Paul, of the nearest clerk. “You'll find him at the lower end of the store. How many yards, ma'am?” This last was of course addressed to a customer. Paul made his way, as directed, to the lower end of the store. A short, wiry, nervous man was writing at a desk. “Is Mr. Smith in?” asked Paul. “My name; what can I do for you?” said the short man, crisply. “I saw an advertisement in the Tribune for a boy.” “And you have applied for the situation?” said Mr. Smith. “How old are you?” with a rapid glance at our hero. “Sixteen--nearly seventeen.” “I suppose that means that you will be seventeen in eleven months and a half.” “No, sir,” said Paul, “I shall be seventeen in three months.” “All right. Most boys call themselves a year older. What's your name?” “P. P. Any relation to Fanny Fern?” “No, sir,” said Paul, rather astonished. “Didn't know but you might be. P. P. and F. F.

As he turned to go away, another boy passed him, probably bent on the same errand with himself. Paul hardly knew whether to feel glad or sorry.

However, beggars mustn't be choosers. But there was one thing I was disappointed about.” “What was that, Paul?” “How much will they give you?” “Only a dollar and a quarter a week, at first.” “That is small, to be sure.” “The most I think of, Uncle Hugh, is, that I shall still be an expense to you. I hoped to get enough to be able to pay my board from the first.” “My dear boy,” said the sexton, kindly, “don't trouble yourself on that score. It costs little more for three than for two, and the little I expend on your account is richly made up by the satisfaction we feel in your society, and your good conduct.” “You say that to encourage me, Uncle Hugh,” said Paul.",

I'm glad to see you,” said the other. This looked kind, and Paul thanked him for his welcome. “O.” said the other, bursting into a laugh, “you needn't trouble yourself about thanking me. I'm glad you've come, because now I shan't have to open the store and sweep out. Just lend a hand there; I'll help you about taking down the shutters this morning, and to-morrow you'll have to get along alone.” The two boys opened the store. “What's your name?” asked Paul's new acquaintance. “Paul Prescott. What is yours?” “Nicholas Benton. You may call me MR. Benton.” “Mr. Benton?” repeated Paul in some astonishment. “Yes; I'm a young man now. I've been Smith & Thompson's boy till now. Now I'm promoted.” Paul looked at MR. Benton with some amusement. That young man was somewhat shorter than himself, and sole proprietor of a stock of pale yellow hair which required an abundant stock of bear's grease to keep it in order. His face was freckled and expressionless. His eyebrows and eyelashes were of the same faded color. He was dressed, however, with some pretensions to smartness.",

I discharge you from my employment.” “Very well, sir,” said Paul, his heart sinking, but keeping up a brave exterior, “then I have only to bid you good-morning.” “Good-morning, sir,” said his employer with mock deference, “I advise you to study for the ministry, and no longer waste your talents in selling calico.” Paul made no reply, but putting on his cap walked out of the store. It was the middle of the week, and Mr. Smith was, of course, owing him a small sum for his services; but Paul was too proud to ask for his money, which that gentleman did not see fit to volunteer. “I am sure I have done right,” thought Paul. “I had no right to misrepresent the goods to that lady. I wonder what Uncle Hugh will say.” “You did perfectly right,” said the sexton, after Paul had related the circumstances of his dismissal. “I wouldn't have had you act differently for twenty situations.",

Day after day Paul went out, and day after day he returned with the same want of success. “Never mind, Paul,” said the sexton encouragingly. “When you do succeed, perhaps you'll get something worth waiting for.” One morning Paul went out feeling that something was going to happen,--he didn't exactly know what,--but he felt somehow that there was to be a change in his luck. He went out, therefore, with more hopefulness than usual; yet, when four o'clock came, and nothing had occurred except failure and disappointment, which unhappily were not at all out of the ordinary course, Paul began to think that he was very foolish to have expected anything. He was walking listlessly along a narrow street, when, on a sudden, he heard an exclamation of terror, of which, on turning round, he easily discovered the cause. Two spirited horses, attached to an elegant carriage, had been terrified in some way, and were now running at the top of their speed. There was no coachman on the box; he had dismounted in order to ring at some door, when the horses started. He was now doing his best to overtake the horses, but in a race between man and horse, it is easy to predict which will have the advantage.",

Her loud cries of alarm no doubt terrified the horses still more, and, by accelerating their speed, tended to make matters worse. Paul was roused from a train of despondent reflections by seeing the horses coming up the street. He instantly comprehended the whole danger of the lady's situation. Most boys would have thought of nothing but getting out of the way, and leaving the carriage and its inmate to their fate. What, indeed, could a boy do against a pair of powerful horses, almost beside themselves with fright? But our hero, as we have already had occasion to see, was brave and self-possessed, and felt an instant desire to rescue the lady, whose glance of helpless terror, as she leaned her head from the window, he could see. Naturally quickwitted, it flashed upon him that the only way to relieve a horse from one terror, was to bring another to bear upon him. With scarcely a moment's premeditation, he rushed out into the middle of the street, full in the path of the furious horses, and with his cheeks pale, for he knew his danger, but with determined air, he waved his arms aloft, and cried “Whoa!” at the top of his voice. The horses saw the sudden movement. They saw the boy standing directly in front of them. They heard the word of command to which they had been used, and by a sudden impulse, relieved from the blind terror which had urged them on, they stopped suddenly, and stood still in the middle of the street, still showing in their quivering limbs the agitation through which they had passed.",

You're a pretty cool hand, you are. I don't know what these foolish horses would have done with the carriage if it had not been for you.” “Let me get out,” exclaimed the lady, not yet recovered from her fright. “I will open the door,” said Paul, observing that the coachman was fully occupied in soothing the horses. He sprang forward, and opening the door of the carriage assisted the lady to descend. She breathed quickly. “I have been very much frightened,” she said; “and I believe I have been in very great danger. Are you the brave boy who stopped the horses?” Paul modestly answered in the affirmative. “And how did you do it? I was so terrified that I was hardly conscious of what was passing, till the horses stopped.” Paul modestly related his agency in the matter. The lady gazed at his flushed face admiringly. “How could you have so much courage?” she asked. “You might have been trampled to death under the hoofs of the horses.” “I didn't think of that. I only thought of stopping the horses.” “You are a brave boy. I shudder when I think of your danger and mine. I shall not dare to get into the carriage again this afternoon.” “Allow me to accompany you home?” said Paul, politely. “Thank you; I will trouble you to go with me as far as Broadway, and then I can get into an omnibus.” She turned and addressed some words to the coachman, directing him to drive",

It won't be for nothing that you have rescued her this afternoon.” As they walked along, the lady, by delicate questioning, succeeded in drawing from our hero his hopes and wishes for the future. Paul, who was of a frank and open nature, found it very natural to tell her all he felt and wished. “He seems a remarkably fine boy,” thought the lady to herself. “I should like to do something for him.” They emerged into Broadway. “I will detain you a little longer,” said the lady; “and perhaps trouble you with a parcel.” “I shall be very glad to take it,” said Paul politely. Appleton's bookstore was close at hand. Into this the lady went, followed by her young companion. A clerk advanced, and inquired her wishes. “Will you show me some writing-desks?” “I am going to purchase a writing-desk for a young friend of mine,” she explained to Paul; “as he is a boy, like yourself, perhaps you can guide me in the selection.” “Certainly,” said Paul, unsuspiciously. Several desks were shown. Paul expressed himself admiringly of one made of rosewood inlaid with pearl. “I think I will take it,” said the lady. The price was paid, and the desk was wrapped up.",

At any rate, he is doing an extensive business.” “What is his business?” “A merchant,” thought Paul; “that is just what I should like to be, but I don't see much prospect of it.” “How do you like Mrs. Danforth?” inquired the sexton. “Very much,” said Paul, warmly. “She was very kind, and made me feel quite at home in her company.” “I hope she may be disposed to assist you. She can easily do so, in her position.” The next day Paul did not as usual go out in search of a situation. His mind was occupied with thoughts of his coming interview with Mrs. Danforth, and he thought he would defer his business plans till the succeeding day. At an early hour in the evening, he paused before an imposing residence on Fifth Avenue, which he had seen but not entered the day previous. He mounted the steps and pulled the bell. A smart-looking man-servant answered his ring. “Is Mrs. Danforth at home?” asked Paul. “I have called to see her.” “Does she expect you?” asked the servant, looking surprised. “Yes; I come at her appointment,” said Paul. “Then I suppose it's all right,” said the man. “Will you come in?” he asked, a little doubtfully.",

It was located on Wall Street, as he learned from the card which had been given him by Mrs. Danforth. He felt a little awkward in making this call. It seemed as if he were going to receive thanks for the service which he had rendered, and he felt that he had already been abundantly repaid. However, he was bound in courtesy to call, since he did so at the request of Mrs. Danforth. It was a large stone building, divided up into offices, to which Paul had been directed. Mr. Danforth's office he found after a little search, upon the second floor. He opened the door with a little embarrassment, and looked about him. In one corner was a small room, used as a more private office, the door of which was closed. In the larger room the only one whom he saw, was a boy, apparently about his own age, who was standing at a desk and writing. This boy looked around as Paul entered, and he at once recognized in him an old acquaintance. “George Dawkins!” he exclaimed in surprise. The latter answered in a careless indifferent tone, not exhibiting any very decided pleasure at meeting his old schoolmate. “Oh, it's you, Prescott, is it?” “Yes,” said Paul, “I haven't met you since you left our school.” “No, I believe we have not met,” said Dawkins, in the same tone as before. “How long have you been in this office?” asked our hero. “I really can't say,” said Dawkins, not looking up.",

Can he be fishing for a place?” “Mr. Danforth is engaged with a visitor just now,” he at length condescended to say; “if your time is not too valuable to wait, you can see him by-and-by.” “Thank you,” said Paul, rather nettled, “you are very polite.” To this Dawkins made no reply, but resumed his pen, and for the next ten minutes seemed entirely oblivious of Paul's presence.

He is very artful.” “I really think, husband, that you ought to remonstrate with Mr. Danforth about taking such a low fellow into his counting-room with our George.” “Pooh!” said Mr. Dawkins, who was a shade more sensible than his wife, “he'd think me a meddler.” “At any rate, George,” pursued his mother, “there's one thing that is due to your family and bringing up,--not to associate with this low fellow any more than business requires.” “I certainly shall not,” said George, promptly. He was the worthy son of such a mother. At the end of the first week, Paul received five dollars, the sum which the merchant had agreed to pay him for his services. With this he felt very rich. He hurried home, and displayed to the sexton the crisp bank note which had been given him. “You will soon be a rich man, Paul,” said Mr. Cameron, with a benevolent smile, returning the bill. “But I want you to keep it, Uncle Hugh.” “Shall I put it in the Savings Bank, for you, Paul?” “I didn't mean that.",

This would leave him one hundred towards the payment of the debt due to Squire Conant. “By-and-by my salary will be raised,” thought Paul. “Then I can save more.” He looked forward with eager anticipation to the time when he should be able to redeem his father's name, and no one would be entitled to cast reproach upon his memory.

Looking up in some surprise, he found that this greeting had come from a man just behind him, whose good-humored face and small, twinkling eyes, he at once recognized. “How do you do, Mr. Stubbs?” inquired Paul, his face lighting up with pleasure. “I'm so's to be round. How be you?” returned the worthy pedler, seizing our hero's hand and shaking it heartily. Mr. Stubbs was attired in all the glory of a blue coat with brass buttons and swallow tails. “When did you come to New York?” asked Paul. “Just arrived; that is, I got in this mornin'. But I say, how you've grown. I shouldn't hardly have known you.” “Shouldn't you, though?” said Paul, gratified as most boys are, on being told that he had grown. “Have you come to the city on business?” “Well, kinder on business, and kinder not. I thought I'd like to have a vacation. Besides, the old lady wanted a silk dress, and she was sot on havin' it bought in York. So I come to the city.” “Where are you stopping, Mr. Stubbs?” “Over to the Astor House. Pretty big hotel, ain't it?” “Yes, I see you are traveling in style.” “Yes, I suppose they charge considerable, but I guess I can stand it.",

I've been round seeing the lions, and came pretty near seeing the elephant at one of them Peter Funk places.” “You did! Tell me about it.” “You see I was walkin' along when a fellow came out of one of them places, and asked me if I wouldn't go in. I didn't want to refuse such a polite invitation, and besides I had a curiosity to see what there was to be seen, so I went in. They put up a silver watch, I could see that it was a good one, and so I bid on it. It ran up to eight dollars and a quarter. I thought it was a pity it should go off so cheap, so I bid eight and a half.” “'Eight and a half and sold,' said the man; 'shall I put it up for you?” “'No, I thank you,' said I, 'I'll take it as it is.' “'But I'll put it up in a nice box for you,' said he. “I told him I didn't care for the box. He seemed very unwilling to let it go, but I took it out of his hand and he couldn't help himself. Well, when they made out the bill, what do you suppose they charged?”",

It seems it was a policeman who was sent to watch them, that spoke. So I paid the money, but as I went out I heard the auctioneer say that the sale was closed for the day. I afterwards learned that if I had allowed them to put the watch in a box, they would have exchanged it for another that was only plated.” “Do you know anybody in the city?” asked Paul. “I've got some relations, but I don't know where they live.” “What is the name?” asked Paul, “we can look into the directory.” “The name is Dawkins,” answered the pedler. “Dawkins!” repeated Paul, in surprise. “Yes, do you happen to know anybody of the name?” “Yes, but I believe it is a rich family.” “Well, so are my relations,” said Jehoshaphat. “You didn't think Jehoshaphat Stubbs had any rich relations, did you? These, as I've heard tell, hold their heads as high as anybody.” “Perhaps I may be mistaken,” said Paul. “What is the name--the Christian name, I mean--of your relation?” “It must be he, then.",

How are ye all to hum?” Dawkins drew back haughtily. “What do you mean?” he said, pale with passion. “Mr. Dawkins,” said Paul, with suppressed merriment, “allow me to introduce your cousin, Mr. Stubbs.” “Jehoshaphat Stubbs,” explained that individual. “Didn't your father never mention my name to you?” “Sir,” said Dawkins, darting a furious glance at Paul, “you are entirely mistaken if you suppose that any relationship exists between me and that--person.” “No, it's you that are mistaken,” said Mr.",

He was engaged in solemnly perusing the leading editorial in the evening paper, when all at once the table at his side gave a sudden lurch, the lamp slid into his lap, setting the paper on fire, and, before the Squire realized his situation, the flames singed his whiskers, and made his face unpleasantly warm. “Cre-a-tion!” he exclaimed, jumping briskly to his feet. The lamp had gone out, so that the cause of the accident remained involved in mystery. The Squire had little trouble in conjecturing, however, that Ben was at the bottom of it. Opening the door hastily, he saw, by the light in the next room, that young gentleman rising from his knees in the immediate vicinity of the table. “Ben-ja-min,” said the Squire, sternly, “What have you been a-doing?” Ben looked sheepish, but said nothing. “I repeat, Benjamin, what have you been a-doing?” “I didn't mean to,” said Ben. “That does not answer my interrogatory. What have you been a-doing?” “I was chasing the cat,” said Ben, “and she got under the table. I went after her, and somehow it upset. Guess my head might have knocked against the legs.” “How old are you, Benjamin?” “A boy of fifteen is too old to play with cats. You may retire to your dormitory.” “It's only seven o'clock, father,” said Ben, in dismay. “Boys that play with cats are young enough to retire at seven,” remarked the Squire, sagaciously.",

Instead, his fertile imagination was employed in devising some new scheme, in which, of course, fun was to be the object attained. While he was thinking, one scheme flashed upon him which he at once pronounced “bully.” “I wish I could do it to-night,” he sighed. “Why can't I?” he thought, after a moment's reflection. The more he thought of it, the more feasible it seemed, and at length he decided to attempt it. Rising from his bed he quickly dressed himself, and then carefully took the sheet, and folding it up in small compass put it under his arm. Next, opening the window, he stepped out upon the sloping roof of the ell part, and slid down to the end where he jumped off, the height not being more than four feet from the ground. By some accident, a tub of suds was standing under the eaves, and Ben, much to his disgust, jumped into it. “Whew!” exclaimed he, “I've jumped into that plaguy tub. What possessed Hannah to put it in a fellow's way?” At this moment the back door opened, and Hannah called out, in a shrill voice, “Who's there?” Ben hastily hid himself, and thought it best not to answer. “I guess 'twas the cat,” said Hannah, as she closed the door. “A two-legged cat,” thought Ben, to himself; “thunder, what sopping wet feet I've got.",

Here he concealed himself under a hedge, and waited silently till the opportunity for playing his practical joke arrived. I regret to say that Mr. Mudge, with whom we have already had considerable to do, was not a member of the temperance society. Latterly, influenced perhaps by Mrs. Mudge's tongue, which made his home far from a happy one, he had got into the habit of spending his evenings at the tavern in the village, where he occasionally indulged in potations that were not good for him. Generally, he kept within the bounds of moderation, but occasionally he exceeded these, as he had done on the present occasion. Some fifteen minutes after Ben had taken his station, he saw, in the moonlight, Mr. Mudge coming up the road, on his way home. Judging from his zigzag course, he was not quite himself. Ben waited till Mr. Mudge was close at hand, when all at once he started from his place of concealment completely enveloped in the sheet with which he was provided. He stood motionless before the astounded Mudge. “Who are you?” exclaimed Mudge, his knees knocking together in terror, clinging to an overhanging branch for support.",

The name occurred to Ben on the spur of the moment. It was with some difficulty that he succeeded in getting out the name, such was his amusement at Mr. Mudge's evident terror. “What do you want of me?” inquired Mudge, nervously. “You half starved me when I was alive,” returned Ben, in a hollow voice, “I must be revenged.” So saying he took one step forward, spreading out his arms. This was too much for Mr. Mudge. With a cry he started and ran towards home at the top of his speed, with Ben in pursuit. “I believe I shall die of laughing,” exclaimed Ben, pausing out of breath, and sitting down on a stone, “what a donkey he is, to be sure, to think there are such things as ghosts. I'd like to be by when he tells Mrs. Mudge.” After a moment's thought, Ben wrapped up the sheet, took it under his arm, and once more ran in pursuit of Mr. Mudge. Meanwhile Mrs. Mudge was sitting in the kitchen of the Poorhouse, mending stockings. She was not in the pleasantest humor, for one of the paupers had managed to break a plate at tea-table (if that can be called tea where no tea is provided), and trifles were sufficient to ruffle Mrs. Mudge's temper. “Where's Mudge, I wonder?” she said, sharply; “over to the tavern, I s'pose, as usual.",

She had not quite reached it when it was flung open violently, and Mr. Mudge, with a wild, disordered look, rushed in, nearly overturning his wife, who gazed at him with mingled anger and astonishment. “What do you mean by this foolery, Mudge?” she demanded, sternly. “What do I mean?” repeated her husband, vaguely. “I needn't ask you,” said his wife, contemptuously. “I see how it is, well enough.

The question for Ben to consider now was, how to get in. If his father had not fastened the front door he might steal in, and slip up stairs on tiptoe without being heard. This would be the easiest way of overcoming the difficulty, and Ben, perceiving that the light was still burning in the sitting-room, had some hopes that he would be able to adopt it. But while he was only a couple of rods distant he saw the lamp taken up by his father, who appeared to be moving from the room. “He's going to lock the front door,” thought Ben, in disappointment; “if I had only got along five minutes sooner.” From his post outside he heard the key turn in the lock. The 'Squire little dreamed that the son whom he imagined fast asleep in his room was just outside the door he was locking. “I guess I'll go round to the back part of the house,” thought Ben, “perhaps I can get in the same way I came out.” Accordingly he went round and managed to clamber upon the roof, which was only four feet from the ground. But a brief trial served to convince our young adventurer that it is a good deal easier sliding down a roof than it is climbing up. The shingles being old were slippery, and though the ascent was not steep, Ben found the progress he made was very much like that of a man at the bottom of a well, who is reported as falling back two feet for every three that he ascended.",

As he wanted to carry these with him, he was at first a little puzzled by this new difficulty. He finally tied the shoes together by the strings and hung them round his neck. He disposed of the stockings by stuffing one in each pocket. “Now,” thought Ben, “I guess I can get along better. I don't know what to do with the plaguy sheet, though.” But necessity is the mother of invention, and Ben found that he could throw the sheet over his shoulders, as a lady does with her shawl. Thus accoutered he recommenced the ascent with considerable confidence. He found that his bare feet clung to the roof more tenaciously than the shoes had done, and success was already within his grasp, when an unforeseen mishap frustrated his plans. He had accomplished about three quarters of the ascent when all at once the string which united the shoes which he had hung round his neck gave way, and both fell with a great thump on the roof. Ben made a clutch for them in which he lost his own hold, and made a hurried descent in their company, alighting with his bare feet on some flinty gravel stones, which he found by no means agreeable.",

George Dawkins was standing at his desk one morning, when a man entered the office, and stepping up to him, unceremoniously tapped him on the shoulder. Dawkins turned. He looked extremely annoyed on perceiving his visitor, whose outward appearance was certainly far from prepossessing. His face exhibited unmistakable marks of dissipation, nor did the huge breast pin and other cheap finery which he wore conceal the fact of his intense vulgarity. His eyes were black and twinkling, his complexion very dark, and his air that of a foreigner. He was, in fact, a Frenchman, though his language would hardly have betrayed him, unless, as sometimes, he chose to interlard his discourse with French phrases.",

Good-morning.” “Mind you bring some money.” “Good-morning,” returned Dawkins, angrily. At length, much to his relief, Duval left the office.

Throughout the day Dawkins appeared unusually nervous, and made several blunders which annoyed Mr. Danforth. Evidently he had something on his mind. Not to keep the reader in suspense, George had fallen among bad companions, where he had learned both to drink and to gamble. In this way he had made the acquaintance of Duval, an unscrupulous sharper, who had contrived to get away all his ready money, and persuading him to play longer in the hope of making up his losses had run him into debt one hundred and fifty dollars. Dawkins gave him an acknowledgment of indebtedness to that amount. This of course placed him in Duval's power, since he knew of no means of raising such a sum. He therefore kept out of the Frenchman's way, avoiding the old haunts where he would have been likely to meet him. Dawkins supposed Duval ignorant of the whereabouts of his employer's counting-room. So he had been, but he made it his business to ascertain where it was. He had no idea of losing sight of so valuable a prize. Dawkins would willingly have broken the appointment he had made with Duval, but he did not dare to do so. He knew that the man was well able to annoy him, and he would not on any account have had the affair disclosed to his father or Mr. Danforth. As Trinity clock struck eight, he entered a low bar-room in the neighborhood of the docks.",

He was supplying the wants of a sailor who already appeared to have taken more drink than was good for him. “Good evening, Mr. Dawkins,” said he, “you're a stranger.” “Is Duval in?” inquired Dawkins, coldly. His pride revolted at the place and company. He had never been here but once before, having met Duval elsewhere. “He's up in his room. John show the young gentleman up to No. 9. Won't you have a glass of something this evening?” “No,” said Dawkins, abruptly. The boy preceded him up a dark and dirty staircase. “That's the room, sir,” he said. “Stop a minute,” said Dawkins, “he may not be in.” He inwardly hoped he might not. But Duval answered his knock by coming to the door himself. “Delighted to see you, mon ami. John, may leave the lamp. That's all, unless Mr. Dawkins wishes to order something.” “I want nothing,” said Dawkins. “They have some capital brandy.” “I am not in the mood for drinking tonight.” “As you please,” said the Frenchman, disappointed; “be seated.” Dawkins sat down in a wooden rocking-chair, minus an arm. “Well,” said Duval, “how much money have you brought me?”",

Are you going to put me off longer?” “I would pay it if I could,” said Dawkins, “but I haven't got the money.” “My father would rave if he knew that I had lost money in such a way.” “But you need not tell him.” “If I ask for money, he will be sure to ask what I want it for.” “Tell him you want clothes, or a watch, or a hundred things.” Dawkins shook his head; “it won't do,” said he. “He wouldn't give me a hundred and fifty dollars.” “Then ask seventy-five, and I will wait a month for the rest.” “Look here, Duval, you have no rightful claim to this money. You've got enough out of me. Just tear up the paper.” Duval laughed scornfully, “Aha, Mr. Dawkins,” he said, “that would be a very pretty arrangement FOR YOU. But I don't see how it is going to benefit me. No, no, I can't afford to throw away a hundred and fifty dollars so easily. If I was a rich man like your father it would make a difference.” “Then you won't remit the debt,” said Dawkins, sullenly. “You would think me a great ninny, if I did.” “Then you may collect it the best way you can.” “What do you mean by that?” demanded the Frenchman, his face darkening. “I mean what I say,” said Dawkins, desperately, “Gambling debts are not recognizable in law.” “Nothing is said about it's being a gambling debt. I have your note.” “Which is worth nothing, since I am a minor.” Duval's face became black with rage. “Aha, my friend,” said he showing his teeth, “this is a very nice game to cheat me out of my money.

He subsided into a moody silence, which Duval watched with satisfaction. “Well, my friend, what will you do about it?” “I don't know what I can do.” “You will think of something. You will find it best,” said the Frenchman, in a tone which veiled a threat. “I will try,” said Dawkins, gloomily. “That is well. I thought you would listen to reason, mon ami. Now we will have a pleasant chat. Hold, I will order some brandy myself.” “Not for me,” said Dawkins, rising from his chair, “I must be going.” “Will you not have one little game?” asked Duval, coaxingly. “No, no, I have had enough of that. Goodnight.” “Then you won't stop. And when shall I have the pleasure of seeing you at my little apartment once more?” “If it is any trouble to you to come, I will call at your office,” said Duval, significantly. “Don't trouble yourself,” said Dawkins, hastily; “I will come here a week from today.” “A week is a long time.” “Long or short, I must have it.” “Very well, mon ami. A week let it be. Good-night. Mind the stairs as you go down.” Dawkins breathed more freely as he passed out into the open air. He was beginning to realize that the way of the transgressor is hard.",

   "text": "A TRAP IS LAID FOR PAUL. Three months before, George Dawkins had made his first visit to a gambling house. At first, he had entered only from curiosity. He watched the play with an interest which gradually deepened, until he was easily persuaded to try his own luck. The stakes were small, but fortune favored him, and he came out some dollars richer than he entered. It would have been fortunate for him if he had failed. As it was, his good fortune encouraged him to another visit. This time he was less fortunate, but his gains about balanced his losses, so that he came out even. On the next occasion he left off with empty pockets. So it went on until at length he fell into the hands of Duval, who had no scruple in fleecing him to as great an extent as he could be induced to go. George Dawkins's reflections were not of the most cheerful character as, leaving Duval, he slowly pursued his way homeward. He felt that he had fallen into the power of an unscrupulous villain, who would have no mercy upon him. He execrated his own folly, without which all the machination of Duval would have been without effect. The question now, however, was, to raise the money. He knew of no one to whom he could apply except his father, nor did he have much hope from that quarter. Still, he would make the effort. Reaching home he found his father seated in the library. He looked up from the evening paper as George entered.",

Mutual recrimination was the rule between them, and George would now have made an angry answer but that he had a favor to ask, and felt it politic to be conciliatory. “If I had supposed you cared for my society, sir, I would have remained at home oftener.” “Umph!” was the only reply elicited from his father. “However, there was a good reason for my not going to the theater to-night.”",

His thoughts continually recurred to his pecuniary embarrassments, and the debt which he owed to Duval seemed to hang like a millstone around his neck. How should he approach his father on the subject? In his present humor he feared he would have little chance. As his father laid down the newspaper Dawkins said, “Wouldn't you like a game of checkers, sir?” This, as he well knew, was a favorite game with his father. “I don't know but I should,” said Mr. Dawkins, more graciously than was his wont. The checker-board was brought, and the two commenced playing. Three games were played all of which his father won. This appeared to put him in a good humor, for as the two ceased playing, he drew a ten-dollar-bill from his pocket-book, and handed to his son, with the remark, “There, George, I don't want you to be penniless. You are a little extravagant, though, I think. Your pay from Mr. Danforth ought to keep you in spending money.” “Yes, sir, I have been rather extravagant, but I am going to reform.” “I am very glad to hear it.” “I wish, sir,” said George a moment afterwards, “that you would allow me to buy my own clothes.” “I've no sort of an objection, I am sure.",

When you need clothing you can go to my tailor and order it, of course not exceeding reasonable limits.” “But,” said Dawkins, desperately, “I don't like Bradshaw's style of making clothes. I would prefer trying some other tailor.” “What fault have you to find with Bradshaw? Is he not one of the most fashionable tailors in the city?” “Yes, sir, I suppose so, but----” “Come, sir, you are growing altogether too particular. All your garments set well, so far as I can judge.” “Yes, sir, but one likes a change sometimes,” persisted George, a little embarrassed for further objections. “Well,” said Mr. Dawkins, after a pause, “If you are so strongly bent upon a new tailor, select one, and order what you need. You can tell him to send in his bill to me.” “Thank you sir,” said his son, by no means pleased at the manner in which his request had been granted.",

It is hardly necessary to say that his alleged dissatisfaction with his father's tailor had all been trumped up for the occasion, and would never have been thought of but for the present emergency. “What shall I do!” thought Dawkins, in perplexity, as he slowly undressed himself and retired to bed. The only true course, undoubtedly, was to confess all to his father, to incur the storm of reproaches which would have followed as the just penalty of his transgression, and then the haunting fear of discovery would have been once and forever removed. But Dawkins was not brave enough for this. He thought only of escaping from his present difficulty without his father's knowledge. He rose the next morning with the burden of care still weighing upon him. In the evening the thought occurred to him that he might retrieve his losses where he had incurred them, and again he bent his steps to the gambling house. He risked five dollars, being one-half of what he had. This was lost. Desperately he hazarded the remaining five dollars, and lost again. With a muttered oath he sprang to his feet, and left the brilliant room, more gloomy and discouraged than ever. He was as badly off as before, and penniless beside. He would have finished the evening at the theater, but his recent loss prevented that.",

Dawkins muttered something unintelligible, and would have hurried on, but Duval detained him. “Why are you in such a hurry, my friend?” he said. “Business,” returned Dawkins, shortly. “That reminds me of the little business affair between us, mon ami.

There are four days more to the week.” Dawkins hurried on feeling very uncomfortable. He was quite aware that four days hence he would be as unprepared to encounter the Frenchman as now. Still, something might happen. Something, unfortunately, did happen. The next day Mr. Danforth was counting a roll of bills which had been just paid in, when he was unexpectedly called out of the counting-room. He unguardedly left the bills upon his own desk. Dawkins saw them lying there. The thought flashed upon him, “There lies what will relieve me from all my embarrassment.” Allowing himself scarcely a minute to think, he took from the roll four fifty dollar notes, thrust one into the pocket of Paul's overcoat, which hung up in the office, drew off his right boot and slipped the other three into the bottom of it, and put it on again. He then nervously resumed his place at his desk. A moment afterwards, Paul, who had been to the post-office, entered with letters which he carried into the inner office and deposited on Mr. Danforth's desk. He observed the roll of bills, and thought his employer careless in leaving so much money exposed, but said nothing on the subject to Dawkins, between whom and himself there was little communication.",

Can you account for the discrepancy?” Mr. Danforth looked keenly at the two boys. Dawkins, who had schooled himself to the ordeal, maintained his outward calmness. Paul, beginning to perceive that his honesty was called in question, flushed. “No, sir,” said the boys simultaneously. “It can hardly be possible, that Mr. Thompson, who is a very careful man, should have made such a mistake in paying me,” resumed Mr. Danforth. “As we have been the only persons here,” said Dawkins, “the only way to vindicate ourselves from suspicion is, to submit to a search.” “Yes, sir,” said Paul promptly.

But it might have been worse.” “No, not very well, Aunt Hester, for Mr. Danforth thinks I have taken some of his money.” “He is very unjust!” exclaimed Aunt Hester, indignantly, “he ought to have known better than to think you would steal.” “Why, no,” said Paul, candidly, “I must confess the evidence was against me, and he doesn't know me as well as you do, Aunt Hester.” “Tell me all about it, Paul.” Aunt Hester sat down and listened attentively to our hero's story. “How do you account for the money being found in your pocket?” she asked at length. “I think it must have been put there by some one else.” “Have you any suspicions?” “Yes,” said Paul, a little reluctantly, “but I don't know whether I ought to have. I may be wronging an innocent person.” “At any rate it won't do any harm to tell me.” “You've heard me speak of George Dawkins?” “I can't help thinking that he put the fifty dollars into my pocket, and took the rest himself.” “How very wicked he must be!” exclaimed Mrs. Cameron, indignantly. “Don't judge him too hastily; Aunt Hester, he may not be guilty, and I know from my own experience how hard it is to be accused when you are innocent.” Soon after the sexton came in, and Paul of course, told his story over again. “Never mind, Paul,” said Uncle Hugh, cheerily.",

Yours, I admit is a heavy one for a boy to bear. But when men are unjust there is One above who will deal justly with us. You have not forgotten him.” “No, Uncle Hugh,” said Paul, reverently. “Trust in him, Paul, and all will come out right at last. He can prove your innocence, and you may be sure he will, in his own good time. Only be patient, Paul.” “I will try to be, Uncle Hugh.” The simple, hearty trust in God, which the sexton manifested, was not lost upon Paul. Sustained by his own consciousness of innocence, and the confidence reposed in him by those who knew him best, his mind soon regained its cheerful tone. He felt an inward conviction that God would vindicate his innocence. His vindication came sooner than he anticipated. The next day as the sexton's family were seated at their plain dinner, a knock was heard upon the outer door. “Sit still, Hester,” said Mr. Cameron. “I will go to the door.” Opening the door he recognized Mr. Danforth, who attended the same church. “Mr. Cameron, I believe,” said Mr. Danforth, pleasantly.",

His employer solved the doubt in his mind by advancing cordially, and taking his hand. “Paul,” he said pleasantly, “I have come here to ask your forgiveness for an injustice, and to beg you to resume your place in my counting-room.” “Have you found out who took the money, sir?” asked Paul, eagerly. Mr. Danforth explained how he had become acquainted with the real thief. In conclusion, he said, “I shall expect you back to-morrow morning, Paul.” “Dawkins of course leaves my employ. You will take his place, and receive his salary, seven dollars a week instead of five. Have you any friend whom you would like to have in your own place?” Paul reflected a moment and finally named a schoolmate of his, the son of poor parents, whom he knew to be anxiously seeking a situation, but without influential friends to help him. “I will take him on your recommendation,” said Mr. Danforth, promptly. “Can you see him this afternoon?” “Yes, sir,” said Paul.

He was not only faithful, but exhibited a rare aptitude for business, which made his services of great value to his employer. From time to time Mr. Danforth increased his salary, so that, though only nineteen, he was now receiving twelve dollars per week, with the prospect of a speedy increase. But with his increasing salary, he did not increase his expenses. He continued as economical as ever. He had not forgotten his father's dying injunction. He remained true to the charge which he had taken upon himself, that of redeeming his father's memory from reproach. This, at times subjected him to the imputation of meanness, but for this he cared little. He would not swerve from the line of duty which he had marked out. One evening as he was walking down Broadway with an acquaintance, Edward Hastings, who was employed in a counting-room near him, they paused before a transparency in front of a hall brilliantly lighted. “The Hutchinsons are going to sing to-night, Paul,” said Hastings. “Did you ever hear them?” “No; but I have often wished to.” “Then suppose we go in.” “Why not. Paul? It seems to me you never go anywhere. You ought to amuse yourself now and then.” “Some other time I will,--not now.” “You are not required to be at home in the evening, are you?”",

The sexton and his wife looked the same as ever. Paul sometimes fancied that Uncle Hugh stooped a little more than he used to do; but his life moved on so placidly and evenly, that he grew old but slowly. Aunt Hester was the same good, kind, benevolent friend that she had always been. No mother could have been more devoted to Paul.

You must have been very economical.” “Yes, Uncle Hugh more so than I have wanted to be, oftentimes; but whenever I have been tempted to spend a cent unnecessarily, I have always called to mind my promise made to father on his deathbed, and I have denied myself.” “You have done well, Paul. There are few who would have had the resolution to do as you have.” “Oh yes, Uncle Hugh,” said Paul, modestly, “I think there are a great many. I begin to feel repaid already.

First, however, he ordered a new suit of a tailor, feeling a desire to appear to the best advantage on his return to the scene of his former humiliation. I must not omit to say that Paul was now a fine-looking young fellow of nineteen, with a frank, manly face, that won favor wherever he went. In due course of time, he arrived at Cedarville, and found his way without difficulty to the house of 'Squire Conant.

'Squire Conant was looking pale and thin. He was just recovering from a severe sickness. “I presume you don't recognize me, sir,” said Paul. “Did I ever see you before?” “Yes, sir; my name is Paul Prescott.” “Not the son of John Prescott?” “The same, sir.

He had saved up a hundred and fifty dollars towards it, but sickness came upon him, and he was obliged to use it.” 'Squire Conant's temper had been subdued by the long and dangerous illness through which he had passed. It had made him set a smaller value on his earthly possessions, from which he might be separated at any moment. When he answered Paul, it was in a manner which our hero did not expect. “Never mind.

How could you have earned so much?” Paul frankly told the story of his struggles; how for years he had practised a pinching economy, in order to redeem his father's memory from reproach.

You shall pay me half the money, and I will cancel the note.” “Not a word. I am satisfied, and that is enough. If I hadn't lent your father the money, I might have invested it with the rest, and lost all.” 'Squire Conant produced the note from a little trunk of papers, and handed it to Paul, who paid him the amount which he had stipulated, expressing at the same time his gratitude for his unexpected generosity. “Never mind about thanks, my boy,” said 'Squire Conant: “I am afraid I have loved money too well heretofore. I hope I am not too old to turn over a new leaf.” HOW PAUL GOES BACK TO WRENVILLE. While 'Squire Conant was speaking, Paul formed a sudden resolution. He remembered that Aunt Lucy Lee was a sister of 'Squire Conant. Perhaps, in his present frame of mind, it might be possible to induce him to do something for her. “I believe I am acquainted with a sister of yours, 'Squire Conant,” he commenced. “Ha!” exclaimed the 'Squire.",

You shall witness my late reparation.” The letter was as follows:---- CEDARVILLE, JAN 13, 18--. I hope you will forgive me for my long neglect. It is not fitting that while I am possessed of abundant means you should longer remain the tenant of an almshouse. I send you by the bearer of this note, Paul Prescott, who, I understand, is a friend of yours, the sum of three hundred dollars. The same sum will be sent you annually. I hope it will be sufficient to maintain you comfortably. I shall endeavor to call upon you soon, and meanwhile remain, Your affectionate brother, Paul read this letter with grateful joy.

He enjoyed in anticipation the joy which he knew Aunt Lucy would feel when the change in her fortunes was communicated to her. He knew also how great would be the chagrin of Mr. and Mrs. Mudge, when they found that the meek old lady whom they hated was about to be rescued from their clutches. On the whole, Paul felt that this was the happiest day of his life. It was a satisfaction to feel that the good fortune of his early friend was all due to his own intercession. He was able to take the cars to a point four miles distant from Wrenville. On getting out on the platform he inquired whether there was a livery stable near by. He was directed to one but a few rods distant. Entering he asked, “Can you let me have a horse and chaise to go to Wrenville?” “Yes, sir,” said the groom. “Let me have the best horse in the stable,” said Paul, “and charge me accordingly.” “Yes, sir,” said the groom, respectfully, judging from Paul's dress and tone that he was a young gentleman of fortune. A spirited animal was brought out, and Paul was soon seated in the chaise driving along the Wrenville road.",

One of his parcels was tied up in a stray leaf of a recent New York Daily, in which he discovered an item which he felt sure would make Aunt Lucy unhappy. He communicated it to Mrs. Mudge, who highly approved his design. She called the old lady from the common room. “Here, Aunt Lucy,” she said, “is something that will interest you.” Aunt Lucy came in, wondering a little at such an unusual mark of attention. Mrs. Mudge immediately commenced reading with malicious emphasis a paragraph concerning a certain Paul Prescott, who had been arrested for thieving, and sentenced to the House of Reformation for a term of months. “There,” said Mrs. Mudge, triumphantly, “what do you say to your favorite now? Turned out well, hasn't he? Didn't I always say so? I always knew that boy was bad at heart, and that he'd come to a bad end.” “I don't believe it's the same boy,” declared Aunt Lucy, who was nevertheless unpleasantly affected by the paragraph. She thought it possible that Paul might have yielded to a powerful temptation. “Perhaps you think I've been making it up. If you don't believe it look at the paper for yourself,” thrusting it into Aunt Lucy's hands.",

Mr. and Mrs. Mudge are no longer in charge of the Wrenville Poorhouse. After Aunt Lucy's departure, Mrs. Mudge became so morose and despotic, that her rule became intolerable. Loud complaints came to the ears of 'Squire Newcome, Chairman of the Overseers of the Poor. One fine morning he was compelled to ride over and give the interesting couple warning to leave immediately. Mr. Mudge undertook the charge of a farm, but his habits of intoxication increased upon him to such an extent, that he was found dead one winter night, in a snow-drift, between his own house and the tavern. Mrs. Mudge was not extravagant in her expressions of grief, not having a very strong affection for her husband. At last accounts, she was keeping a boarding-house in a manufacturing town. Some time since, her boarders held an indignation meeting, and threatened to leave in a body unless she improved her fare,--a course to which she was obliged to submit. George Dawkins, unable to obtain a recommendation from Mr. Danforth, did not succeed in securing another place in New York. He finally prevailed upon his father to advance him a sum of money, with which he went to California. Let us hope that he may “turn over a new leaf” there, and establish a better reputation than he did in New York.",

   "text": "Mr. Stubbs is still in the tin business. He is as happy as the day is long, and so are his wife and children. Once a year he comes to New York and pays Paul a visit. This supplies him with something to talk about for the rest of the year. He is frugal in his expenses, and is able to lay up a couple of hundred dollars every year, which he confides to Paul, in whose financial skill he has the utmost confidence. I am sure my boy readers would not forgive me for omitting to tell them something more about Ben Newcome. Although his mirthful spirit sometimes led him into mischief, he was good-hearted, and I have known him do many an act of kindness, even at considerable trouble to himself. It will be remembered that in consequence of his night adventure, during which he personated a ghost, much to the terror of Mr. Mudge his father determined to send him to a military school. This proved to be a wise arrangement. The discipline was such as Ben needed, and he soon distinguished himself by his excellence in the military drill. Soon after he graduated, the Rebellion broke out, and Ben was at once, in spite of his youth, elected Captain of the Wrenville company. At the battle of Antietam he acquitted himself with so much credit that he was promoted to a major. He was again promoted, and when Richmond was evacuated, he was one of the first officers to enter the streets of the Rebel capital, a colonel in command of his regiment.",

   "text": "I have heard on high authority, that he is considered one of the best officers in the service. Mr. and Mrs. Cameron are still living. They are happy in the success and increasing prosperity of Paul, whom they regard as a son. Between them and Aunt Lucy he would stand a very fair chance of being spoiled, if his own good sense and good judgment were not sufficient to save him from such a misfortune. Paul is now admitted to a small interest in the firm, which entitles him to a share in the profits. As Danforth and Co. have done a very extensive business of late years, this interest brings him in a very handsome income. There is only one cause of difference between him and the sexton. He insists that Uncle Hugh, who is getting infirm, should resign his office, as he is abundantly able to support the whole family. But the good sexton loves his duties, and will continue to discharge them as long as he is able. And now we must bid farewell to Paul. He has battled bravely with the difficulties and discouragements that beset him in early life, he has been faithful to the charge which he voluntarily assumed, and his father's memory is free from reproach. He often wishes that his father could have lived to witness his prosperity? but God has decreed it otherwise. Happy in the love of friends, and in the enjoyment of all that can make life desirable, so far as external circumstances have that power, let us all wish him God speed!",
