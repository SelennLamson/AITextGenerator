There was nothing notable about him, except a slight contrast between the holiday gaiety of his clothes and the official gravity of his face."}, {"size": 714, "text": "His clothes included a slight, pale grey jacket, a white waistcoat, and a silver straw hat with a grey-blue ribbon. His lean face was dark by contrast, and ended in a curt black beard that looked Spanish and suggested an Elizabethan ruff. He was smoking a cigarette with the seriousness of an idler. There was nothing about him to indicate the fact that the grey jacket covered a loaded revolver, that the white waistcoat covered a police card, or that the straw hat covered one of the most powerful intellects in Europe. For this was Valentin himself, the head of the Paris police and the most famous investigator of the world; and he was coming from Brussels to London to make the greatest arrest of the century."}, {"size": 667, "text": "Flambeau was in England. The police of three countries had tracked the great criminal at last from Ghent to Brussels, from Brussels to the Hook of Holland; and it was conjectured that he would take some advantage of the unfamiliarity and confusion of the Eucharistic Congress, then taking place in London. Probably he would travel as some minor clerk or secretary connected with it; but, of course, Valentin could not be certain; nobody could be certain about Flambeau. It is many years now since this colossus of crime suddenly ceased keeping the world in a turmoil; and when he ceased, as they said after the death of Roland, there was a great quiet upon the earth."}, {"size": 742, "text": "But in his best days (I mean, of course, his worst) Flambeau was a figure as statuesque and international as the Kaiser. Almost every morning the daily paper announced that he had escaped the consequences of one extraordinary crime by committing another. He was a Gascon of gigantic stature and bodily daring; and the wildest tales were told of his outbursts of athletic humour; how he turned the juge d\u2019instruction upside down and stood him on his head, \u201cto clear his mind\u201d; how he ran down the Rue de Rivoli with a policeman under each arm. It is due to him to say that his fantastic physical strength was generally employed in such bloodless though undignified scenes; his real crimes were chiefly those of ingenious and wholesale robbery."}, {"size": 652, "text": "But each of his thefts was almost a new sin, and would make a story by itself. It was he who ran the great Tyrolean Dairy Company in London, with no dairies, no cows, no carts, no milk, but with some thousand subscribers. These he served by the simple operation of moving the little milk cans outside people\u2019s doors to the doors of his own customers. It was he who had kept up an unaccountable and close correspondence with a young lady whose whole letter-bag was intercepted, by the extraordinary trick of photographing his messages infinitesimally small upon the slides of a microscope. A sweeping simplicity, however, marked many of his experiments."}, {"size": 675, "text": "It is said that he once repainted all the numbers in a street in the dead of night merely to divert one traveller into a trap. It is quite certain that he invented a portable pillar-box, which he put up at corners in quiet suburbs on the chance of strangers dropping postal orders into it. Lastly, he was known to be a startling acrobat; despite his huge figure, he could leap like a grasshopper and melt into the tree-tops like a monkey. Hence the great Valentin, when he set out to find Flambeau, was perfectly aware that his adventures would not end when he had found him. But how was he to find him? On this the great Valentin\u2019s ideas were still in process of settlement."}, {"size": 829, "text": "There was one thing which Flambeau, with all his dexterity of disguise, could not cover, and that was his singular height. If Valentin\u2019s quick eye had caught a tall apple-woman, a tall grenadier, or even a tolerably tall duchess, he might have arrested them on the spot. But all along his train there was nobody that could be a disguised Flambeau, any more than a cat could be a disguised giraffe. About the people on the boat he had already satisfied himself; and the people picked up at Harwich or on the journey limited themselves with certainty to six. There was a short railway official travelling up to the terminus, three fairly short market gardeners picked up two stations afterwards, one very short widow lady going up from a small Essex town, and a very short Roman Catholic priest going up from a small Essex village."}, {"size": 624, "text": "When it came to the last case, Valentin gave it up and almost laughed. The little priest was so much the essence of those Eastern flats; he had a face as round and dull as a Norfolk dumpling; he had eyes as empty as the North Sea; he had several brown paper parcels, which he was quite incapable of collecting. The Eucharistic Congress had doubtless sucked out of their local stagnation many such creatures, blind and helpless, like moles disinterred. Valentin was a sceptic in the severe style of France, and could have no love for priests. But he could have pity for them, and this one might have provoked pity in anybody."}, {"size": 866, "text": "He had a large, shabby umbrella, which constantly fell on the floor. He did not seem to know which was the right end of his return ticket. He explained with a moon-calf simplicity to everybody in the carriage that he had to be careful, because he had something made of real silver \u201cwith blue stones\u201d in one of his brown-paper parcels. His quaint blending of Essex flatness with saintly simplicity continuously amused the Frenchman till the priest arrived (somehow) at Tottenham with all his parcels, and came back for his umbrella. When he did the last, Valentin even had the good nature to warn him not to take care of the silver by telling everybody about it. But to whomever he talked, Valentin kept his eye open for someone else; he looked out steadily for anyone, rich or poor, male or female, who was well up to six feet; for Flambeau was four inches above it."}, {"size": 626, "text": "He alighted at Liverpool Street, however, quite conscientiously secure that he had not missed the criminal so far. He then went to Scotland Yard to regularise his position and arrange for help in case of need; he then lit another cigarette and went for a long stroll in the streets of London. As he was walking in the streets and squares beyond Victoria, he paused suddenly and stood. It was a quaint, quiet square, very typical of London, full of an accidental stillness. The tall, flat houses round looked at once prosperous and uninhabited; the square of shrubbery in the centre looked as deserted as a green Pacific islet."}, {"size": 617, "text": "One of the four sides was much higher than the rest, like a dais; and the line of this side was broken by one of London\u2019s admirable accidents--a restaurant that looked as if it had strayed from Soho. It was an unreasonably attractive object, with dwarf plants in pots and long, striped blinds of lemon yellow and white. It stood specially high above the street, and in the usual patchwork way of London, a flight of steps from the street ran up to meet the front door almost as a fire-escape might run up to a first-floor window. Valentin stood and smoked in front of the yellow-white blinds and considered them long."}, {"size": 699, "text": "The most incredible thing about miracles is that they happen. A few clouds in heaven do come together into the staring shape of one human eye. A tree does stand up in the landscape of a doubtful journey in the exact and elaborate shape of a note of interrogation. I have seen both these things myself within the last few days. Nelson does die in the instant of victory; and a man named Williams does quite accidentally murder a man named Williamson; it sounds like a sort of infanticide. In short, there is in life an element of elfin coincidence which people reckoning on the prosaic may perpetually miss. As it has been well expressed in the paradox of Poe, wisdom should reckon on the unforeseen."}, {"size": 616, "text": "Aristide Valentin was unfathomably French; and the French intelligence is intelligence specially and solely. He was not \u201ca thinking machine\u201d; for that is a brainless phrase of modern fatalism and materialism. A machine only is a machine because it cannot think. But he was a thinking man, and a plain man at the same time. All his wonderful successes, that looked like conjuring, had been gained by plodding logic, by clear and commonplace French thought. The French electrify the world not by starting any paradox, they electrify it by carrying out a truism. They carry a truism so far--as in the French Revolution."}, {"size": 600, "text": "But exactly because Valentin understood reason, he understood the limits of reason. Only a man who knows nothing of motors talks of motoring without petrol; only a man who knows nothing of reason talks of reasoning without strong, undisputed first principles. Here he had no strong first principles. Flambeau had been missed at Harwich; and if he was in London at all, he might be anything from a tall tramp on Wimbledon Common to a tall toast-master at the Hotel Metropole. In such a naked state of nescience, Valentin had a view and a method of his own. In such cases he reckoned on the unforeseen."}, {"size": 708, "text": "In such cases, when he could not follow the train of the reasonable, he coldly and carefully followed the train of the unreasonable. Instead of going to the right places--banks, police stations, rendezvous--he systematically went to the wrong places; knocked at every empty house, turned down every cul de sac, went up every lane blocked with rubbish, went round every crescent that led him uselessly out of the way. He defended this crazy course quite logically. He said that if one had a clue this was the worst way; but if one had no clue at all it was the best, because there was just the chance that any oddity that caught the eye of the pursuer might be the same that had caught the eye of the pursued."}, {"size": 685, "text": "Somewhere a man must begin, and it had better be just where another man might stop. Something about that flight of steps up to the shop, something about the quietude and quaintness of the restaurant, roused all the detective\u2019s rare romantic fancy and made him resolve to strike at random. He went up the steps, and sitting down at a table by the window, asked for a cup of black coffee. It was half-way through the morning, and he had not breakfasted; the slight litter of other breakfasts stood about on the table to remind him of his hunger; and adding a poached egg to his order, he proceeded musingly to shake some white sugar into his coffee, thinking all the time about Flambeau."}, {"size": 719, "text": "He remembered how Flambeau had escaped, once by a pair of nail scissors, and once by a house on fire; once by having to pay for an unstamped letter, and once by getting people to look through a telescope at a comet that might destroy the world. He thought his detective brain as good as the criminal\u2019s, which was true. But he fully realised the disadvantage. \u201cThe criminal is the creative artist; the detective only the critic,\u201d he said with a sour smile, and lifted his coffee cup to his lips slowly, and put it down very quickly. He had put salt in it. He looked at the vessel from which the silvery powder had come; it was certainly a sugar-basin; as unmistakably meant for sugar as a champagne-bottle for champagne."}, {"size": 630, "text": "He wondered why they should keep salt in it. He looked to see if there were any more orthodox vessels. Yes; there were two salt-cellars quite full. Perhaps there was some speciality in the condiment in the salt-cellars. He tasted it; it was sugar. Then he looked round at the restaurant with a refreshed air of interest, to see if there were any other traces of that singular artistic taste which puts the sugar in the salt-cellars and the salt in the sugar-basin. Except for an odd splash of some dark fluid on one of the white-papered walls, the whole place appeared neat, cheerful and ordinary. He rang the bell for the waiter."}, {"size": 624, "text": "When that official hurried up, fuzzy-haired and somewhat blear-eyed at that early hour, the detective (who was not without an appreciation of the simpler forms of humour) asked him to taste the sugar and see if it was up to the high reputation of the hotel. The result was that the waiter yawned suddenly and woke up. \u201cDo you play this delicate joke on your customers every morning?\u201d inquired Valentin. \u201cDoes changing the salt and sugar never pall on you as a jest?\u201d The waiter, when this irony grew clearer, stammeringly assured him that the establishment had certainly no such intention; it must be a most curious mistake."}, {"size": 684, "text": "He picked up the sugar-basin and looked at it; he picked up the salt-cellar and looked at that, his face growing more and more bewildered. At last he abruptly excused himself, and hurrying away, returned in a few seconds with the proprietor. The proprietor also examined the sugar-basin and then the salt-cellar; the proprietor also looked bewildered. Suddenly the waiter seemed to grow inarticulate with a rush of words. \u201cI zink,\u201d he stuttered eagerly, \u201cI zink it is those two clergy-men.\u201d \u201cWhat two clergymen?\u201d \u201cThe two clergymen,\u201d said the waiter, \u201cthat threw soup at the wall.\u201d \u201cThrew soup at the wall?\u201d repeated Valentin, feeling sure this must be some singular Italian metaphor."}, {"size": 609, "text": "\u201cYes, yes,\u201d said the attendant excitedly, and pointed at the dark splash on the white paper; \u201cthrew it over there on the wall.\u201d Valentin looked his query at the proprietor, who came to his rescue with fuller reports. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s quite true, though I don\u2019t suppose it has anything to do with the sugar and salt. Two clergymen came in and drank soup here very early, as soon as the shutters were taken down. They were both very quiet, respectable people; one of them paid the bill and went out; the other, who seemed a slower coach altogether, was some minutes longer getting his things together."}, {"size": 841, "text": "But he went at last. Only, the instant before he stepped into the street he deliberately picked up his cup, which he had only half emptied, and threw the soup slap on the wall. I was in the back room myself, and so was the waiter; so I could only rush out in time to find the wall splashed and the shop empty. It don\u2019t do any particular damage, but it was confounded cheek; and I tried to catch the men in the street. They were too far off though; I only noticed they went round the next corner into Carstairs Street.\u201d The detective was on his feet, hat settled and stick in hand. He had already decided that in the universal darkness of his mind he could only follow the first odd finger that pointed; and this finger was odd enough. Paying his bill and clashing the glass doors behind him, he was soon swinging round into the other street."}, {"size": 615, "text": "It was fortunate that even in such fevered moments his eye was cool and quick. Something in a shop-front went by him like a mere flash; yet he went back to look at it. The shop was a popular greengrocer and fruiterer\u2019s, an array of goods set out in the open air and plainly ticketed with their names and prices. In the two most prominent compartments were two heaps, of oranges and of nuts respectively. On the heap of nuts lay a scrap of cardboard, on which was written in bold, blue chalk, \u201cBest tangerine oranges, two a penny.\u201d On the oranges was the equally clear and exact description, \u201cFinest Brazil nuts, 4d."}, {"size": 856, "text": "a lb.\u201d M. Valentin looked at these two placards and fancied he had met this highly subtle form of humour before, and that somewhat recently. He drew the attention of the red-faced fruiterer, who was looking rather sullenly up and down the street, to this inaccuracy in his advertisements. The fruiterer said nothing, but sharply put each card into its proper place. The detective, leaning elegantly on his walking-cane, continued to scrutinise the shop. At last he said, \u201cPray excuse my apparent irrelevance, my good sir, but I should like to ask you a question in experimental psychology and the association of ideas.\u201d The red-faced shopman regarded him with an eye of menace; but he continued gaily, swinging his cane, \u201cWhy,\u201d he pursued, \u201cwhy are two tickets wrongly placed in a greengrocer\u2019s shop like a shovel hat that has come to London for a holiday?"}, {"size": 604, "text": "Or, in case I do not make myself clear, what is the mystical association which connects the idea of nuts marked as oranges with the idea of two clergymen, one tall and the other short?\u201d The eyes of the tradesman stood out of his head like a snail\u2019s; he really seemed for an instant likely to fling himself upon the stranger. At last he stammered angrily: \u201cI don\u2019t know what you \u2018ave to do with it, but if you\u2019re one of their friends, you can tell \u2018em from me that I\u2019ll knock their silly \u2018eads off, parsons or no parsons, if they upset my apples again.\u201d \u201cIndeed?\u201d asked the detective, with great sympathy."}, {"size": 605, "text": "\u201cDid they upset your apples?\u201d \u201cOne of \u2018em did,\u201d said the heated shopman; \u201crolled \u2018em all over the street. I\u2019d \u2018ave caught the fool but for havin\u2019 to pick \u2018em up.\u201d \u201cWhich way did these parsons go?\u201d asked Valentin. \u201cUp that second road on the left-hand side, and then across the square,\u201d said the other promptly. \u201cThanks,\u201d replied Valentin, and vanished like a fairy. On the other side of the second square he found a policeman, and said: \u201cThis is urgent, constable; have you seen two clergymen in shovel hats?\u201d The policeman began to chuckle heavily. \u201cI \u2018ave, sir; and if you arst me, one of \u2018em was drunk."}, {"size": 664, "text": "He stood in the middle of the road that bewildered that--\u201d \u201cWhich way did they go?\u201d snapped Valentin. \u201cThey took one of them yellow buses over there,\u201d answered the man; \u201cthem that go to Hampstead.\u201d Valentin produced his official card and said very rapidly: \u201cCall up two of your men to come with me in pursuit,\u201d and crossed the road with such contagious energy that the ponderous policeman was moved to almost agile obedience. In a minute and a half the French detective was joined on the opposite pavement by an inspector and a man in plain clothes. \u201cWell, sir,\u201d began the former, with smiling importance, \u201cand what may--?\u201d Valentin pointed suddenly with his cane."}, {"size": 660, "text": "\u201cI\u2019ll tell you on the top of that omnibus,\u201d he said, and was darting and dodging across the tangle of the traffic. When all three sank panting on the top seats of the yellow vehicle, the inspector said: \u201cWe could go four times as quick in a taxi.\u201d \u201cQuite true,\u201d replied their leader placidly, \u201cif we only had an idea of where we were going.\u201d \u201cWell, where are you going?\u201d asked the other, staring. Valentin smoked frowningly for a few seconds; then, removing his cigarette, he said: \u201cIf you know what a man\u2019s doing, get in front of him; but if you want to guess what he\u2019s doing, keep behind him. Stray when he strays; stop when he stops; travel as slowly as he."}, {"size": 704, "text": "Then you may see what he saw and may act as he acted. All we can do is to keep our eyes skinned for a queer thing.\u201d \u201cWhat sort of queer thing do you mean?\u201d asked the inspector. \u201cAny sort of queer thing,\u201d answered Valentin, and relapsed into obstinate silence. The yellow omnibus crawled up the northern roads for what seemed like hours on end; the great detective would not explain further, and perhaps his assistants felt a silent and growing doubt of his errand. Perhaps, also, they felt a silent and growing desire for lunch, for the hours crept long past the normal luncheon hour, and the long roads of the North London suburbs seemed to shoot out into length after length like an infernal telescope."}, {"size": 615, "text": "It was one of those journeys on which a man perpetually feels that now at last he must have come to the end of the universe, and then finds he has only come to the beginning of Tufnell Park. London died away in draggled taverns and dreary scrubs, and then was unaccountably born again in blazing high streets and blatant hotels. It was like passing through thirteen separate vulgar cities all just touching each other. But though the winter twilight was already threatening the road ahead of them, the Parisian detective still sat silent and watchful, eyeing the frontage of the streets that slid by on either side."}, {"size": 787, "text": "By the time they had left Camden Town behind, the policemen were nearly asleep; at least, they gave something like a jump as Valentin leapt erect, struck a hand on each man\u2019s shoulder, and shouted to the driver to stop. They tumbled down the steps into the road without realising why they had been dislodged; when they looked round for enlightenment they found Valentin triumphantly pointing his finger towards a window on the left side of the road. It was a large window, forming part of the long facade of a gilt and palatial public-house; it was the part reserved for respectable dining, and labelled \u201cRestaurant.\u201d This window, like all the rest along the frontage of the hotel, was of frosted and figured glass; but in the middle of it was a big, black smash, like a star in the ice."}, {"size": 699, "text": "\u201cOur cue at last,\u201d cried Valentin, waving his stick; \u201cthe place with the broken window.\u201d \u201cWhat window? What cue?\u201d asked his principal assistant. \u201cWhy, what proof is there that this has anything to do with them?\u201d Valentin almost broke his bamboo stick with rage. \u201cProof!\u201d he cried. \u201cGood God! the man is looking for proof! Why, of course, the chances are twenty to one that it has nothing to do with them. But what else can we do? Don\u2019t you see we must either follow one wild possibility or else go home to bed?\u201d He banged his way into the restaurant, followed by his companions, and they were soon seated at a late luncheon at a little table, and looked at the star of smashed glass from the inside."}, {"size": 638, "text": "Not that it was very informative to them even then. \u201cGot your window broken, I see,\u201d said Valentin to the waiter as he paid the bill. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d answered the attendant, bending busily over the change, to which Valentin silently added an enormous tip. The waiter straightened himself with mild but unmistakable animation. \u201cAh, yes, sir,\u201d he said. \u201cVery odd thing, that, sir.\u201d \u201cIndeed?\u201d Tell us about it,\u201d said the detective with careless curiosity. \u201cWell, two gents in black came in,\u201d said the waiter; \u201ctwo of those foreign parsons that are running about. They had a cheap and quiet little lunch, and one of them paid for it and went out."}, {"size": 693, "text": "The other was just going out to join him when I looked at my change again and found he\u2019d paid me more than three times too much. \u2018Here,\u2019 I says to the chap who was nearly out of the door, \u2018you\u2019ve paid too much.\u2019 \u2018Oh,\u2019 he says, very cool, \u2018have we?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 I says, and picks up the bill to show him. Well, that was a knock-out.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked his interlocutor. \u201cWell, I\u2019d have sworn on seven Bibles that I\u2019d put 4s. on that bill. But now I saw I\u2019d put 14s., as plain as paint.\u201d \u201cWell?\u201d cried Valentin, moving slowly, but with burning eyes, \u201cand then?\u201d \u201cThe parson at the door he says all serene, \u2018Sorry to confuse your accounts, but it\u2019ll pay for the window.\u2019 \u2018What window?\u2019 I says."}, {"size": 627, "text": "\u2018The one I\u2019m going to break,\u2019 he says, and smashed that blessed pane with his umbrella.\u201d All three inquirers made an exclamation; and the inspector said under his breath, \u201cAre we after escaped lunatics?\u201d The waiter went on with some relish for the ridiculous story: \u201cI was so knocked silly for a second, I couldn\u2019t do anything. The man marched out of the place and joined his friend just round the corner. Then they went so quick up Bullock Street that I couldn\u2019t catch them, though I ran round the bars to do it.\u201d \u201cBullock Street,\u201d said the detective, and shot up that thoroughfare as quickly as the strange couple he pursued."}, {"size": 757, "text": "Their journey now took them through bare brick ways like tunnels; streets with few lights and even with few windows; streets that seemed built out of the blank backs of everything and everywhere. Dusk was deepening, and it was not easy even for the London policemen to guess in what exact direction they were treading. The inspector, however, was pretty certain that they would eventually strike some part of Hampstead Heath. Abruptly one bulging gas-lit window broke the blue twilight like a bull\u2019s-eye lantern; and Valentin stopped an instant before a little garish sweetstuff shop. After an instant\u2019s hesitation he went in; he stood amid the gaudy colours of the confectionery with entire gravity and bought thirteen chocolate cigars with a certain care."}, {"size": 820, "text": "He was clearly preparing an opening; but he did not need one. An angular, elderly young woman in the shop had regarded his elegant appearance with a merely automatic inquiry; but when she saw the door behind him blocked with the blue uniform of the inspector, her eyes seemed to wake up. \u201cOh,\u201d she said, \u201cif you\u2019ve come about that parcel, I\u2019ve sent it off already.\u201d \u201cParcel?\u201d repeated Valentin; and it was his turn to look inquiring. \u201cI mean the parcel the gentleman left--the clergyman gentleman.\u201d \u201cFor goodness\u2019 sake,\u201d said Valentin, leaning forward with his first real confession of eagerness, \u201cfor Heaven\u2019s sake tell us what happened exactly.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said the woman a little doubtfully, \u201cthe clergymen came in about half an hour ago and bought some peppermints and talked a bit, and then went off towards the Heath."}, {"size": 835, "text": "But a second after, one of them runs back into the shop and says, \u2018Have I left a parcel!\u2019 Well, I looked everywhere and couldn\u2019t see one; so he says, \u2018Never mind; but if it should turn up, please post it to this address,\u2019 and he left me the address and a shilling for my trouble. And sure enough, though I thought I\u2019d looked everywhere, I found he\u2019d left a brown paper parcel, so I posted it to the place he said. I can\u2019t remember the address now; it was somewhere in Westminster. But as the thing seemed so important, I thought perhaps the police had come about it.\u201d \u201cSo they have,\u201d said Valentin shortly. \u201cIs Hampstead Heath near here?\u201d \u201cStraight on for fifteen minutes,\u201d said the woman, \u201cand you\u2019ll come right out on the open.\u201d Valentin sprang out of the shop and began to run. The other detectives followed him at a reluctant trot."}, {"size": 722, "text": "The street they threaded was so narrow and shut in by shadows that when they came out unexpectedly into the void common and vast sky they were startled to find the evening still so light and clear. A perfect dome of peacock-green sank into gold amid the blackening trees and the dark violet distances. The glowing green tint was just deep enough to pick out in points of crystal one or two stars. All that was left of the daylight lay in a golden glitter across the edge of Hampstead and that popular hollow which is called the Vale of Health. The holiday makers who roam this region had not wholly dispersed; a few couples sat shapelessly on benches; and here and there a distant girl still shrieked in one of the swings."}, {"size": 617, "text": "The glory of heaven deepened and darkened around the sublime vulgarity of man; and standing on the slope and looking across the valley, Valentin beheld the thing which he sought. Among the black and breaking groups in that distance was one especially black which did not break--a group of two figures clerically clad. Though they seemed as small as insects, Valentin could see that one of them was much smaller than the other. Though the other had a student\u2019s stoop and an inconspicuous manner, he could see that the man was well over six feet high. He shut his teeth and went forward, whirling his stick impatiently."}, {"size": 722, "text": "By the time he had substantially diminished the distance and magnified the two black figures as in a vast microscope, he had perceived something else; something which startled him, and yet which he had somehow expected. Whoever was the tall priest, there could be no doubt about the identity of the short one. It was his friend of the Harwich train, the stumpy little cure of Essex whom he had warned about his brown paper parcels. Now, so far as this went, everything fitted in finally and rationally enough. Valentin had learned by his inquiries that morning that a Father Brown from Essex was bringing up a silver cross with sapphires, a relic of considerable value, to show some of the foreign priests at the congress."}, {"size": 609, "text": "This undoubtedly was the \u201csilver with blue stones\u201d; and Father Brown undoubtedly was the little greenhorn in the train. Now there was nothing wonderful about the fact that what Valentin had found out Flambeau had also found out; Flambeau found out everything. Also there was nothing wonderful in the fact that when Flambeau heard of a sapphire cross he should try to steal it; that was the most natural thing in all natural history. And most certainly there was nothing wonderful about the fact that Flambeau should have it all his own way with such a silly sheep as the man with the umbrella and the parcels."}, {"size": 641, "text": "He was the sort of man whom anybody could lead on a string to the North Pole; it was not surprising that an actor like Flambeau, dressed as another priest, could lead him to Hampstead Heath. So far the crime seemed clear enough; and while the detective pitied the priest for his helplessness, he almost despised Flambeau for condescending to so gullible a victim. But when Valentin thought of all that had happened in between, of all that had led him to his triumph, he racked his brains for the smallest rhyme or reason in it. What had the stealing of a blue-and-silver cross from a priest from Essex to do with chucking soup at wall paper?"}, {"size": 648, "text": "What had it to do with calling nuts oranges, or with paying for windows first and breaking them afterwards? He had come to the end of his chase; yet somehow he had missed the middle of it. When he failed (which was seldom), he had usually grasped the clue, but nevertheless missed the criminal. Here he had grasped the criminal, but still he could not grasp the clue. The two figures that they followed were crawling like black flies across the huge green contour of a hill. They were evidently sunk in conversation, and perhaps did not notice where they were going; but they were certainly going to the wilder and more silent heights of the Heath."}, {"size": 727, "text": "As their pursuers gained on them, the latter had to use the undignified attitudes of the deer-stalker, to crouch behind clumps of trees and even to crawl prostrate in deep grass. By these ungainly ingenuities the hunters even came close enough to the quarry to hear the murmur of the discussion, but no word could be distinguished except the word \u201creason\u201d recurring frequently in a high and almost childish voice. Once over an abrupt dip of land and a dense tangle of thickets, the detectives actually lost the two figures they were following. They did not find the trail again for an agonising ten minutes, and then it led round the brow of a great dome of hill overlooking an amphitheatre of rich and desolate sunset scenery."}, {"size": 638, "text": "Under a tree in this commanding yet neglected spot was an old ramshackle wooden seat. On this seat sat the two priests still in serious speech together. The gorgeous green and gold still clung to the darkening horizon; but the dome above was turning slowly from peacock-green to peacock-blue, and the stars detached themselves more and more like solid jewels. Mutely motioning to his followers, Valentin contrived to creep up behind the big branching tree, and, standing there in deathly silence, heard the words of the strange priests for the first time. After he had listened for a minute and a half, he was gripped by a devilish doubt."}, {"size": 672, "text": "Perhaps he had dragged the two English policemen to the wastes of a nocturnal heath on an errand no saner than seeking figs on its thistles. For the two priests were talking exactly like priests, piously, with learning and leisure, about the most aerial enigmas of theology. The little Essex priest spoke the more simply, with his round face turned to the strengthening stars; the other talked with his head bowed, as if he were not even worthy to look at them.

I know that people charge the Church with lowering reason, but it is just the other way. Alone on earth, the Church makes reason really supreme. Alone on earth, the Church affirms that God himself is bound by reason.\u201d The other priest raised his austere face to the spangled sky and said: \u201cYet who knows"}, {"size": 635, "text": "if in that infinite universe--?\u201d \u201cOnly infinite physically,\u201d said the little priest, turning sharply in his seat, \u201cnot infinite in the sense of escaping from the laws of truth.\u201d Valentin behind his tree was tearing his fingernails with silent fury. He seemed almost to hear the sniggers of the English detectives whom he had brought so far on a fantastic guess only to listen to the metaphysical gossip of two mild old parsons.

Valentin\u2019s house was perhaps as peculiar and celebrated as its master.

Perhaps such scientific natures have some psychic prevision of the most tremendous problem of their lives.

It was slightly slashed about the neck and jaw, but the face was substantially unhurt.

But between the office and the cloak room was a small private room without other outlet, sometimes used by the proprietor for delicate and important matters, such as lending a duke a thousand pounds or declining to lend him sixpence.

Nevertheless, he stared at the darkened ceiling, and listened to the sound.

One could not conceive any place where there was less reason to apprehend anything irregular. But these footsteps were so odd that one could not decide to call them regular or irregular.

The man was either walking very fast down one-half of the corridor in order to walk very slow down the other half; or he was walking very slow at one end to have the rapture of walking fast at the other. Neither suggestion seemed to make much sense. His brain was growing darker and darker, like his room.

Or some entirely new kind of scientific exercise? Father Brown began to ask himself with more exactness what the steps suggested. Taking the slow step first: it certainly was not the step of the proprietor. Men of his type walk with a rapid waddle, or they sit still. It could not be any servant or messenger waiting for directions. It did not sound like it. The poorer orders (in an oligarchy) sometimes lurch about when they are slightly drunk, but generally, and especially in such gorgeous scenes, they stand or sit in constrained attitudes. No; that heavy yet springy step, with a kind of careless emphasis, not specially noisy, yet not caring what noise it made, belonged to only one of the animals of this earth.

This time they had a third oddity. Previously the unknown man had walked, with levity indeed and lightning quickness, but he had walked. This time he ran. One could hear the swift, soft, bounding steps coming along the corridor, like the pads of a fleeing and leaping panther.

Leonard Quinton, the poet, had himself most carefully arranged this effect; and it is doubtful whether he so perfectly expressed his personality in any of his poems.

Quinton was a genius, if a morbid one; and even his morbidity appeared more in his life than in his work. In temperament he was weak and waspish, and his health had suffered heavily from oriental experiments with opium. His wife--a handsome, hard-working, and, indeed, over-worked woman objected to the opium, but objected much more to a live Indian hermit in white and yellow robes, whom her husband insisted on entertaining for months together, a Virgil to guide his spirit through the heavens and the hells of the east."}, {"size": 747, "text": "It was out of this artistic household that Father Brown and his friend stepped on to the door-step; and to judge from their faces, they stepped out of it with much relief.

The vessel was just comfortable for two people; there was room only for necessities, and Flambeau had stocked it with such things as his special philosophy considered necessary."}, {"size": 644, "text": "They reduced themselves, apparently, to four essentials: tins of salmon, if he should want to eat; loaded revolvers, if he should want to fight; a bottle of brandy, presumably in case he should faint; and a priest, presumably in case he should die. With this light luggage he crawled down the little Norfolk rivers, intending to reach the Broads at last, but meanwhile delighting in the overhanging gardens and meadows, the mirrored mansions or villages, lingering to fish in the pools and corners, and in some sense hugging the shore. Like a true philosopher, Flambeau had no aim in his holiday; but, like a true philosopher, he had an excuse."}, {"size": 874, "text": "He had a sort of half purpose, which he took just so seriously that its success would crown the holiday, but just so lightly that its failure would not spoil it. Years ago, when he had been a king of thieves and the most famous figure in Paris, he had often received wild communications of approval, denunciation, or even love; but one had, somehow, stuck in his memory. It consisted simply of a visiting-card, in an envelope with an English postmark. On the back of the card was written in French and in green ink: \u201cIf you ever retire and become respectable, come and see me. I want to meet you, for I have met all the other great men of my time. That trick of yours of getting one detective to arrest the other was the most splendid scene in French history.\u201d On the front of the card was engraved in the formal fashion, \u201cPrince Saradine, Reed House, Reed Island, Norfolk.\u201d"}, {"size": 771, "text": "He had not troubled much about the prince then, beyond ascertaining that he had been a brilliant and fashionable figure in southern Italy. In his youth, it was said, he had eloped with a married woman of high rank; the escapade was scarcely startling in his social world, but it had clung to men\u2019s minds because of an additional tragedy: the alleged suicide of the insulted husband, who appeared to have flung himself over a precipice in Sicily. The prince then lived in Vienna for a time, but his more recent years seemed to have been passed in perpetual and restless travel. But when Flambeau, like the prince himself, had left European celebrity and settled in England, it occurred to him that he might pay a surprise visit to this eminent exile in the Norfolk Broads."}, {"size": 732, "text": "Whether he should find the place he had no idea; and, indeed, it was sufficiently small and forgotten. But, as things fell out, he found it much sooner than he expected. They had moored their boat one night under a bank veiled in high grasses and short pollarded trees. Sleep, after heavy sculling, had come to them early, and by a corresponding accident they awoke before it was light. To speak more strictly, they awoke before it was daylight; for a large lemon moon was only just setting in the forest of high grass above their heads, and the sky was of a vivid violet-blue, nocturnal but bright. Both men had simultaneously a reminiscence of childhood, of the elfin and adventurous time when tall weeds close over us like woods."}, {"size": 643, "text": "Standing up thus against the large low moon, the daisies really seemed to be giant daisies, the dandelions to be giant dandelions. Somehow it reminded them of the dado of a nursery wall-paper. The drop of the river-bed sufficed to sink them under the roots of all shrubs and flowers and make them gaze upwards at the grass. \u201cBy Jove!\u201d said Flambeau, \u201cit\u2019s like being in fairyland.\u201d Father Brown sat bolt upright in the boat and crossed himself. His movement was so abrupt that his friend asked him, with a mild stare, what was the matter. \u201cThe people who wrote the mediaeval ballads,\u201d answered the priest, \u201cknew more about fairies than you do."}, {"size": 607, "text": "It isn\u2019t only nice things that happen in fairyland.\u201d \u201cOh, bosh!\u201d said Flambeau. \u201cOnly nice things could happen under such an innocent moon. I am for pushing on now and seeing what does really come. We may die and rot before we ever see again such a moon or such a mood.\u201d \u201cAll right,\u201d said Father Brown. \u201cI never said it was always wrong to enter fairyland. I only said it was always dangerous.\u201d They pushed slowly up the brightening river; the glowing violet of the sky and the pale gold of the moon grew fainter and fainter, and faded into that vast colourless cosmos that precedes the colours of the dawn."}, {"size": 611, "text": "When the first faint stripes of red and gold and grey split the horizon from end to end they were broken by the black bulk of a town or village which sat on the river just ahead of them. It was already an easy twilight, in which all things were visible, when they came under the hanging roofs and bridges of this riverside hamlet. The houses, with their long, low, stooping roofs, seemed to come down to drink at the river, like huge grey and red cattle. The broadening and whitening dawn had already turned to working daylight before they saw any living creature on the wharves and bridges of that silent town."}, {"size": 832, "text": "Eventually they saw a very placid and prosperous man in his shirt sleeves, with a face as round as the recently sunken moon, and rays of red whisker around the low arc of it, who was leaning on a post above the sluggish tide. By an impulse not to be analysed, Flambeau rose to his full height in the swaying boat and shouted at the man to ask if he knew Reed Island or Reed House. The prosperous man\u2019s smile grew slightly more expansive, and he simply pointed up the river towards the next bend of it. Flambeau went ahead without further speech. The boat took many such grassy corners and followed many such reedy and silent reaches of river; but before the search had become monotonous they had swung round a specially sharp angle and come into the silence of a sort of pool or lake, the sight of which instinctively arrested them."}, {"size": 626, "text": "For in the middle of this wider piece of water, fringed on every side with rushes, lay a long, low islet, along which ran a long, low house or bungalow built of bamboo or some kind of tough tropic cane. The upstanding rods of bamboo which made the walls were pale yellow, the sloping rods that made the roof were of darker red or brown, otherwise the long house was a thing of repetition and monotony. The early morning breeze rustled the reeds round the island and sang in the strange ribbed house as in a giant pan-pipe. \u201cBy George!\u201d cried Flambeau; \u201chere is the place, after all! Here is Reed Island, if ever there was one."}, {"size": 627, "text": "Here is Reed House, if it is anywhere. I believe that fat man with whiskers was a fairy.\u201d \u201cPerhaps,\u201d remarked Father Brown impartially. \u201cIf he was, he was a bad fairy.\u201d But even as he spoke the impetuous Flambeau had run his boat ashore in the rattling reeds, and they stood in the long, quaint islet beside the odd and silent house. The house stood with its back, as it were, to the river and the only landing-stage; the main entrance was on the other side, and looked down the long island garden. The visitors approached it, therefore, by a small path running round nearly three sides of the house, close under the low eaves."}, {"size": 742, "text": "Through three different windows on three different sides they looked in on the same long, well-lit room, panelled in light wood, with a large number of looking-glasses, and laid out as for an elegant lunch. The front door, when they came round to it at last, was flanked by two turquoise-blue flower pots. It was opened by a butler of the drearier type--long, lean, grey and listless--who murmured that Prince Saradine was from home at present, but was expected hourly; the house being kept ready for him and his guests. The exhibition of the card with the scrawl of green ink awoke a flicker of life in the parchment face of the depressed retainer, and it was with a certain shaky courtesy that he suggested that the strangers should remain."}, {"size": 640, "text": "\u201cHis Highness may be here any minute,\u201d he said, \u201cand would be distressed to have just missed any gentleman he had invited. We have orders always to keep a little cold lunch for him and his friends, and I am sure he would wish it to be offered.\u201d Moved with curiosity to this minor adventure, Flambeau assented gracefully, and followed the old man, who ushered him ceremoniously into the long, lightly panelled room. There was nothing very notable about it, except the rather unusual alternation of many long, low windows with many long, low oblongs of looking-glass, which gave a singular air of lightness and unsubstantialness to the place."}, {"size": 700, "text": "It was somehow like lunching out of doors. One or two pictures of a quiet kind hung in the corners, one a large grey photograph of a very young man in uniform, another a red chalk sketch of two long-haired boys. Asked by Flambeau whether the soldierly person was the prince, the butler answered shortly in the negative; it was the prince\u2019s younger brother, Captain Stephen Saradine, he said. And with that the old man seemed to dry up suddenly and lose all taste for conversation. After lunch had tailed off with exquisite coffee and liqueurs, the guests were introduced to the garden, the library, and the housekeeper--a dark, handsome lady, of no little majesty, and rather like a plutonic Madonna."}, {"size": 625, "text": "It appeared that she and the butler were the only survivors of the prince\u2019s original foreign menage the other servants now in the house being new and collected in Norfolk by the housekeeper. This latter lady went by the name of Mrs. Anthony, but she spoke with a slight Italian accent, and Flambeau did not doubt that Anthony was a Norfolk version of some more Latin name. Mr. Paul, the butler, also had a faintly foreign air, but he was in tongue and training English, as are many of the most polished men-servants of the cosmopolitan nobility. Pretty and unique as it was, the place had about it a curious luminous sadness."}, {"size": 745, "text": "Hours passed in it like days. The long, well-windowed rooms were full of daylight, but it seemed a dead daylight. And through all other incidental noises, the sound of talk, the clink of glasses, or the passing feet of servants, they could hear on all sides of the house the melancholy noise of the river. \u201cWe have taken a wrong turning, and come to a wrong place,\u201d said Father Brown, looking out of the window at the grey-green sedges and the silver flood. \u201cNever mind; one can sometimes do good by being the right person in the wrong place.\u201d Father Brown, though commonly a silent, was an oddly sympathetic little man, and in those few but endless hours he unconsciously sank deeper into the secrets of Reed House than his professional friend."}, {"size": 768, "text": "He had that knack of friendly silence which is so essential to gossip; and saying scarcely a word, he probably obtained from his new acquaintances all that in any case they would have told. The butler indeed was naturally uncommunicative. He betrayed a sullen and almost animal affection for his master; who, he said, had been very badly treated. The chief offender seemed to be his highness\u2019s brother, whose name alone would lengthen the old man\u2019s lantern jaws and pucker his parrot nose into a sneer. Captain Stephen was a ne\u2019er-do-well, apparently, and had drained his benevolent brother of hundreds and thousands; forced him to fly from fashionable life and live quietly in this retreat. That was all Paul, the butler, would say, and Paul was obviously a partisan."}, {"size": 715, "text": "The Italian housekeeper was somewhat more communicative, being, as Brown fancied, somewhat less content. Her tone about her master was faintly acid; though not without a certain awe. Flambeau and his friend were standing in the room of the looking-glasses examining the red sketch of the two boys, when the housekeeper swept in swiftly on some domestic errand. It was a peculiarity of this glittering, glass-panelled place that anyone entering was reflected in four or five mirrors at once; and Father Brown, without turning round, stopped in the middle of a sentence of family criticism. But Flambeau, who had his face close up to the picture, was already saying in a loud voice, \u201cThe brothers Saradine, I suppose."}, {"size": 739, "text": "They both look innocent enough. It would be hard to say which is the good brother and which the bad.\u201d Then, realising the lady\u2019s presence, he turned the conversation with some triviality, and strolled out into the garden. But Father Brown still gazed steadily at the red crayon sketch; and Mrs. Anthony still gazed steadily at Father Brown. She had large and tragic brown eyes, and her olive face glowed darkly with a curious and painful wonder--as of one doubtful of a stranger\u2019s identity or purpose. Whether the little priest\u2019s coat and creed touched some southern memories of confession, or whether she fancied he knew more than he did, she said to him in a low voice as to a fellow plotter, \u201cHe is right enough in one way, your friend."}, {"size": 742, "text": "He says it would be hard to pick out the good and bad brothers. Oh, it would be hard, it would be mighty hard, to pick out the good one.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t understand you,\u201d said Father Brown, and began to move away. The woman took a step nearer to him, with thunderous brows and a sort of savage stoop, like a bull lowering his horns. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a good one,\u201d she hissed. \u201cThere was badness enough in the captain taking all that money, but I don\u2019t think there was much goodness in the prince giving it. The captain\u2019s not the only one with something against him.\u201d A light dawned on the cleric\u2019s averted face, and his mouth formed silently the word \u201cblackmail.\u201d Even as he did so the woman turned an abrupt white face over her shoulder and almost fell."}, {"size": 745, "text": "The door had opened soundlessly and the pale Paul stood like a ghost in the doorway. By the weird trick of the reflecting walls, it seemed as if five Pauls had entered by five doors simultaneously. \u201cHis Highness,\u201d he said, \u201chas just arrived.\u201d In the same flash the figure of a man had passed outside the first window, crossing the sunlit pane like a lighted stage. An instant later he passed at the second window and the many mirrors repainted in successive frames the same eagle profile and marching figure. He was erect and alert, but his hair was white and his complexion of an odd ivory yellow. He had that short, curved Roman nose which generally goes with long, lean cheeks and chin, but these were partly masked by moustache and imperial."}, {"size": 654, "text": "The moustache was much darker than the beard, giving an effect slightly theatrical, and he was dressed up to the same dashing part, having a white top hat, an orchid in his coat, a yellow waistcoat and yellow gloves which he flapped and swung as he walked. When he came round to the front door they heard the stiff Paul open it, and heard the new arrival say cheerfully, \u201cWell, you see I have come.\u201d The stiff Mr. Paul bowed and answered in his inaudible manner; for a few minutes their conversation could not be heard. Then the butler said, \u201cEverything is at your disposal;\u201d and the glove-flapping Prince Saradine came gaily into the room to greet them."}, {"size": 714, "text": "They beheld once more that spectral scene--five princes entering a room with five doors. The prince put the white hat and yellow gloves on the table and offered his hand quite cordially. \u201cDelighted to see you here, Mr. Flambeau,\u201d he said. \u201cKnowing you very well by reputation, if that\u2019s not an indiscreet remark.\u201d \u201cNot at all,\u201d answered Flambeau, laughing. \u201cI am not sensitive. Very few reputations are gained by unsullied virtue.\u201d The prince flashed a sharp look at him to see if the retort had any personal point; then he laughed also and offered chairs to everyone, including himself. \u201cPleasant little place, this, I think,\u201d he said with a detached air. \u201cNot much to do, I fear; but the fishing is really good.\u201d"}, {"size": 671, "text": "The priest, who was staring at him with the grave stare of a baby, was haunted by some fancy that escaped definition. He looked at the grey, carefully curled hair, yellow white visage, and slim, somewhat foppish figure. These were not unnatural, though perhaps a shade prononc\u00e9, like the outfit of a figure behind the footlights. The nameless interest lay in something else, in the very framework of the face; Brown was tormented with a half memory of having seen it somewhere before. The man looked like some old friend of his dressed up. Then he suddenly remembered the mirrors, and put his fancy down to some psychological effect of that multiplication of human masks."}, {"size": 776, "text": "Prince Saradine distributed his social attentions between his guests with great gaiety and tact. Finding the detective of a sporting turn and eager to employ his holiday, he guided Flambeau and Flambeau\u2019s boat down to the best fishing spot in the stream, and was back in his own canoe in twenty minutes to join Father Brown in the library and plunge equally politely into the priest\u2019s more philosophic pleasures. He seemed to know a great deal both about the fishing and the books, though of these not the most edifying; he spoke five or six languages, though chiefly the slang of each. He had evidently lived in varied cities and very motley societies, for some of his cheerfullest stories were about gambling hells and opium dens, Australian bushrangers or Italian brigands."}, {"size": 686, "text": "Father Brown knew that the once-celebrated Saradine had spent his last few years in almost ceaseless travel, but he had not guessed that the travels were so disreputable or so amusing. Indeed, with all his dignity of a man of the world, Prince Saradine radiated to such sensitive observers as the priest, a certain atmosphere of the restless and even the unreliable. His face was fastidious, but his eye was wild; he had little nervous tricks, like a man shaken by drink or drugs, and he neither had, nor professed to have, his hand on the helm of household affairs. All these were left to the two old servants, especially to the butler, who was plainly the central pillar of the house."}, {"size": 747, "text": "Mr. Paul, indeed, was not so much a butler as a sort of steward or, even, chamberlain; he dined privately, but with almost as much pomp as his master; he was feared by all the servants; and he consulted with the prince decorously, but somewhat unbendingly--rather as if he were the prince\u2019s solicitor. The sombre housekeeper was a mere shadow in comparison; indeed, she seemed to efface herself and wait only on the butler, and Brown heard no more of those volcanic whispers which had half told him of the younger brother who blackmailed the elder. Whether the prince was really being thus bled by the absent captain, he could not be certain, but there was something insecure and secretive about Saradine that made the tale by no means incredible."}, {"size": 612, "text": "When they went once more into the long hall with the windows and the mirrors, yellow evening was dropping over the waters and the willowy banks; and a bittern sounded in the distance like an elf upon his dwarfish drum. The same singular sentiment of some sad and evil fairyland crossed the priest\u2019s mind again like a little grey cloud. \u201cI wish Flambeau were back,\u201d he muttered. \u201cDo you believe in doom?\u201d asked the restless Prince Saradine suddenly. \u201cNo,\u201d answered his guest. \u201cI believe in Doomsday.\u201d The prince turned from the window and stared at him in a singular manner, his face in shadow against the sunset."}, {"size": 602, "text": "\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he asked. \u201cI mean that we here are on the wrong side of the tapestry,\u201d answered Father Brown. \u201cThe things that happen here do not seem to mean anything; they mean something somewhere else. Somewhere else retribution will come on the real offender. Here it often seems to fall on the wrong person.\u201d The prince made an inexplicable noise like an animal; in his shadowed face the eyes were shining queerly. A new and shrewd thought exploded silently in the other\u2019s mind. Was there another meaning in Saradine\u2019s blend of brilliancy and abruptness? Was the prince--Was he perfectly sane?"}, {"size": 600, "text": "He was repeating, \u201cThe wrong person--the wrong person,\u201d many more times than was natural in a social exclamation. Then Father Brown awoke tardily to a second truth. In the mirrors before him he could see the silent door standing open, and the silent Mr. Paul standing in it, with his usual pallid impassiveness. \u201cI thought it better to announce at once,\u201d he said, with the same stiff respectfulness as of an old family lawyer, \u201ca boat rowed by six men has come to the landing-stage, and there\u2019s a gentleman sitting in the stern.\u201d \u201cA boat!\u201d repeated the prince; \u201ca gentleman?\u201d and he rose to his feet."}, {"size": 726, "text": "There was a startled silence punctuated only by the odd noise of the bird in the sedge; and then, before anyone could speak again, a new face and figure passed in profile round the three sunlit windows, as the prince had passed an hour or two before. But except for the accident that both outlines were aquiline, they had little in common. Instead of the new white topper of Saradine, was a black one of antiquated or foreign shape; under it was a young and very solemn face, clean shaven, blue about its resolute chin, and carrying a faint suggestion of the young Napoleon. The association was assisted by something old and odd about the whole get-up, as of a man who had never troubled to change the fashions of his fathers."}, {"size": 636, "text": "He had a shabby blue frock coat, a red, soldierly looking waistcoat, and a kind of coarse white trousers common among the early Victorians, but strangely incongruous today. From all this old clothes-shop his olive face stood out strangely young and monstrously sincere. \u201cThe deuce!\u201d said Prince Saradine, and clapping on his white hat he went to the front door himself, flinging it open on the sunset garden. By that time the new-comer and his followers were drawn up on the lawn like a small stage army. The six boatmen had pulled the boat well up on shore, and were guarding it almost menacingly, holding their oars erect like spears."}, {"size": 617, "text": "They were swarthy men, and some of them wore earrings. But one of them stood forward beside the olive-faced young man in the red waistcoat, and carried a large black case of unfamiliar form. \u201cYour name,\u201d said the young man, \u201cis Saradine?\u201d Saradine assented rather negligently. The new-comer had dull, dog-like brown eyes, as different as possible from the restless and glittering grey eyes of the prince. But once again Father Brown was tortured with a sense of having seen somewhere a replica of the face; and once again he remembered the repetitions of the glass-panelled room, and put down the coincidence to that."}, {"size": 704, "text": "\u201cConfound this crystal palace!\u201d he muttered. \u201cOne sees everything too many times.

With his left hand he politely took off his old-fashioned top-hat; with his right he caught Prince Saradine so ringing a crack across the face that the white top hat rolled down the steps and one of the blue flower-pots rocked upon its pedestal. The prince, whatever he was, was evidently not a coward; he sprang at his enemy\u2019s throat and almost bore him backwards to the grass."}, {"size": 894, "text": "But his enemy extricated himself with a singularly inappropriate air of hurried politeness. \u201cThat is all right,\u201d he said, panting and in halting English. \u201cI have insulted.

He took out of it two long Italian rapiers, with splendid steel hilts and blades, which he planted point downwards in the lawn. The strange young man standing facing the entrance with his yellow and vindictive face, the two swords standing up in the turf like two crosses in a cemetery, and the line of the ranked towers behind, gave it all an odd appearance of being some barbaric court of justice.

Saradine was a French freemason and a fierce atheist, and a priest moved him by the law of contraries. And for the other man neither priest nor layman moved him at all.

For the two men were singularly well matched, the prince using his skill with a sort of cynical confidence, the Sicilian using his with a murderous care.

Though her flat was only three floors above, she managed in the few seconds of ascent to give Flambeau a great many of her fundamental views in an off-hand manner; they were to the general effect that she was a modern working woman and loved modern working machinery."}, {"size": 751, "text": "Her bright black eyes blazed with abstract anger against those who rebuke mechanic science and ask for the return of romance. Everyone, she said, ought to be able to manage machines, just as she could manage the lift.

She certainly had a temper, of a snappy, practical sort; the gestures of her thin, elegant hands were abrupt or even destructive. Once Flambeau entered her office on some typewriting business, and found she had just flung a pair of spectacles belonging to her sister into the middle of the floor and stamped on them."}, {"size": 660, "text": "She was already in the rapids of an ethical tirade about the \u201csickly medical notions\u201d and the morbid admission of weakness implied in such an apparatus.

Flambeau, quite bewildered with this fanaticism, could not refrain from asking Miss Pauline (with direct French logic) why a pair of spectacles was a more morbid sign of weakness than a lift, and why, if science might help us in the one effort, it might not help us in the other."}, {"size": 747, "text": "\u201cThat is so different,\u201d said Pauline Stacey, loftily. \u201cBatteries and motors and all those things are marks of the force of man--yes, Mr. Flambeau, and the force of woman, too!

For three times in the day the new sun-worshipper went out on his little balcony, in the face of all Westminster, to say some litany to his shining lord: once at daybreak, once at sunset, and once at the shock of noon.

Yet they never broke; and Olivier\u2019s curt account ends with a strong tribute of admiration for the mystic valour of these imbeciles. \u2018Our line then advanced finally,\u2019 writes Olivier, \u2018and drove them into the river; we captured General St. Clare himself and several other officers."}, {"size": 765, "text": "The colonel and the major had both fallen in the battle.

However this may be, it is certain that when the general mounted again he was still talking earnestly to Murray; and that as he walked his horse slowly down the road towards the river, the tall Ulsterman still walked by his bridle rein in earnest debate. The soldiers watched the two until they vanished behind a clump of trees where the road turned towards the river."}, {"size": 691, "text": "The colonel had gone back to his tent, and the men to their pickets; the man with the diary lingered for another four minutes, and saw a marvellous sight. \u201cThe great white horse which had marched slowly down the road, as it had marched in so many processions, flew back, galloping up the road towards them as if it were mad to win a race.

It might mean a man physically formidable living under a tropic sun in an Oriental society, and soaking himself without sense or guidance in an Oriental Book. Of course, he read the Old Testament rather than the New. Of course, he found in the Old Testament anything that he wanted--lust, tyranny, treason. Oh, I dare say he was honest, as you call it.
