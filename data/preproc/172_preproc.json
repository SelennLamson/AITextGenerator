Be pleased to know, most worthy, that this little book is dedicated to you in affection and respect. The faults of the composition are plain to you all. I begin merely in the hope of saying something further of the adventures of ROGER MIFFLIN, whose exploits in \"Parnassus on Wheels\" some of you have been kind enough to applaud. But then came Miss Titania Chapman, and my young advertising man fell in love with her, and the two of them rather ran away with the tale. I think I should explain that the passage in Chapter VIII, dealing with the delightful talent of Mr."}, {"size": 629, "text": "Sidney Drew, was written before the lamented death of that charming artist. But as it was a sincere tribute, sincerely meant, I have seen no reason for removing it. Chapters I, II, III, and VI appeared originally in The Bookman, and to the editor of that admirable magazine I owe thanks for his permission to reprint. Now that Roger is to have ten Parnassuses on the road, I am emboldened to think that some of you may encounter them on their travels. And if you do, I hope you will find that these new errants of the Parnassus on Wheels Corporation are living up to the ancient and honourable traditions of our noble profession."}, {"size": 623, "text": "Philadelphia, April 28, 1919 If you are ever in Brooklyn, that borough of superb sunsets and magnificent vistas of husband-propelled baby-carriages, it is to be hoped you may chance upon a quiet by-street where there is a very remarkable bookshop. This bookshop, which does business under the unusual name \"Parnassus at Home,\" is housed in one of the comfortable old brown-stone dwellings which have been the joy of several generations of plumbers and cockroaches. The owner of the business has been at pains to remodel the house to make it a more suitable shrine for his trade, which deals entirely in second-hand volumes."}, {"size": 577, "text": "There is no second-hand bookshop in the world more worthy of respect. It was about six o'clock of a cold November evening, with gusts of rain splattering upon the pavement, when a young man proceeded uncertainly along Gissing Street, stopping now and then to look at shop windows as though doubtful of his way. At the warm and shining face of a French rotisserie he halted to compare the number enamelled on the transom with a memorandum in his hand. Then he pushed on for a few minutes, at last reaching the address he sought. Over the entrance his eye was caught by the sign:"}, {"size": 633, "text": "PARNASSUS AT HOME R. AND H. MIFFLIN BOOKLOVERS WELCOME! THIS SHOP IS HAUNTED He stumbled down the three steps that led into the dwelling of the muses, lowered his overcoat collar, and looked about. It was very different from such bookstores as he had been accustomed to patronize. Two stories of the old house had been thrown into one: the lower space was divided into little alcoves; above, a gallery ran round the wall, which carried books to the ceiling. The air was heavy with the delightful fragrance of mellowed paper and leather surcharged with a strong bouquet of tobacco. In front of him he found a large placard in a frame:"}, {"size": 712, "text": "THIS SHOP IS HAUNTED by the ghosts Of all great literature, in hosts; We sell no fakes or trashes. Lovers of books are welcome here, No clerks will babble in your ear, Please smoke--but don't drop ashes! ---- Browse as long as you like. Prices of all books plainly marked. If you want to ask questions, you'll find the proprietor where the tobacco smoke is thickest. We pay cash for books. We have what you want, though you may not know you want it. Malnutrition of the reading faculty is a serious thing. Let us prescribe for you. By R. & H. MIFFLIN, Proprs.The shop had a warm and comfortable obscurity, a kind of drowsy dusk, stabbed here and there by bright cones of yellow light from green-shaded electrics."}, {"size": 646, "text": "There was an all-pervasive drift of tobacco smoke, which eddied and fumed under the glass lamp shades. Passing down a narrow aisle between the alcoves the visitor noticed that some of the compartments were wholly in darkness; in others where lamps were glowing he could see a table and chairs. In one corner, under a sign lettered ESSAYS, an elderly gentleman was reading, with a face of fanatical ecstasy illumined by the sharp glare of electricity; but there was no wreath of smoke about him so the newcomer concluded he was not the proprietor. As the young man approached the back of the shop the general effect became more and more fantastic."}, {"size": 610, "text": "On some skylight far overhead he could hear the rain drumming; but otherwise the place was completely silent, peopled only (so it seemed) by the gurgitating whorls of smoke and the bright profile of the essay reader. It seemed like a secret fane, some shrine of curious rites, and the young man's throat was tightened by a stricture which was half agitation and half tobacco. Towering above him into the gloom were shelves and shelves of books, darkling toward the roof. He saw a table with a cylinder of brown paper and twine, evidently where purchases might be wrapped; but there was no sign of an attendant."}, {"size": 625, "text": "\"This place may indeed be haunted,\" he thought, \"perhaps by the delighted soul of Sir Walter Raleigh, patron of the weed, but seemingly not by the proprietors.\" His eyes, searching the blue and vaporous vistas of the shop, were caught by a circle of brightness that shone with a curious egg-like lustre. It was round and white, gleaming in the sheen of a hanging light, a bright island in a surf of tobacco smoke. He came more close, and found it was a bald head. This head (he then saw) surmounted a small, sharp-eyed man who sat tilted back in a swivel chair, in a corner which seemed the nerve centre of the establishment."}, {"size": 605, "text": "The large pigeon-holed desk in front of him was piled high with volumes of all sorts, with tins of tobacco and newspaper clippings and letters. An antiquated typewriter, looking something like a harpsichord, was half-buried in sheets of manuscript. The little bald-headed man was smoking a corn-cob pipe and reading a cook-book. \"I beg your pardon,\" said the caller, pleasantly; \"is this the proprietor?\" Mr. Roger Mifflin, the proprietor of \"Parnassus at Home,\" looked up, and the visitor saw that he had keen blue eyes, a short red beard, and a convincing air of competent originality. \"It is,\" said Mr."}, {"size": 639, "text": "Mifflin. \"Anything I can do for you?\" \"My name is Aubrey Gilbert,\" said the young man. \"I am representing the Grey-Matter Advertising Agency. I want to discuss with you the advisability of your letting us handle your advertising account, prepare snappy copy for you, and place it in large circulation mediums. Now the war's over, you ought to prepare some constructive campaign for bigger business.\" The bookseller's face beamed. He put down his cook-book, blew an expanding gust of smoke, and looked up brightly. \"My dear chap,\" he said, \"I don't do any advertising.\" \"Impossible!\" cried the other, aghast as at some gratuitous indecency."}, {"size": 811, "text": "\"Not in the sense you mean. Such advertising as benefits me most is done for me by the snappiest copywriters in the business.\" \"I suppose you refer to Whitewash and Gilt?\" said Mr. Gilbert wistfully. \"Not at all. The people who are doing my advertising are Stevenson, Browning, Conrad and Company.\" \"Dear me,\" said the Grey-Matter solicitor. \"I don't know that agency at all. Still, I doubt if their copy has more pep than ours.\" \"I don't think you get me. I mean that my advertising is done by the books I sell. If I sell a man a book by Stevenson or Conrad, a book that delights or terrifies him, that man and that book become my living advertisements.\" \"But that word-of-mouth advertising is exploded,\" said Gilbert. \"You can't get Distribution that way. You've got to keep your trademark before the public.\""}, {"size": 619, "text": "\"By the bones of Tauchnitz!\" cried Mifflin. \"Look here, you wouldn't go to a doctor, a medical specialist, and tell him he ought to advertise in papers and magazines? A doctor is advertised by the bodies he cures. My business is advertised by the minds I stimulate. And let me tell you that the book business is different from other trades. People don't know they want books. I can see just by looking at you that your mind is ill for lack of books but you are blissfully unaware of it! People don't go to a bookseller until some serious mental accident or disease makes them aware of their danger. Then they come here."}, {"size": 655, "text": "For me to advertise would be about as useful as telling people who feel perfectly well that they ought to go to the doctor. Do you know why people are reading more books now than ever before? Because the terrific catastrophe of the war has made them realize that their minds are ill. The world was suffering from all sorts of mental fevers and aches and disorders, and never knew it. Now our mental pangs are only too manifest. We are all reading, hungrily, hastily, trying to find out--after the trouble is over--what was the matter with our minds.\" The little bookseller was standing up now, and his visitor watched him with mingled amusement and alarm."}, {"size": 841, "text": "\"You know,\" said Mifflin, \"I am interested that you should have thought it worth while to come in here. It reinforces my conviction of the amazing future ahead of the book business. But I tell you that future lies not merely in systematizing it as a trade. It lies in dignifying it as a profession. It is small use to jeer at the public for craving shoddy books, quack books, untrue books. Physician, cure thyself! Let the bookseller learn to know and revere good books, he will teach the customer. The hunger for good books is more general and more insistent than you would dream. But it is still in a way subconscious. People need books, but they don't know they need them. Generally they are not aware that the books they need are in existence.\" \"Why wouldn't advertising be the way to let them know?\" asked the young man, rather acutely."}, {"size": 615, "text": "\"My dear chap, I understand the value of advertising. But in my own case it would be futile. I am not a dealer in merchandise but a specialist in adjusting the book to the human need. Between ourselves, there is no such thing, abstractly, as a 'good' book. A book is 'good' only when it meets some human hunger or refutes some human error. A book that is good for me would very likely be punk for you. My pleasure is to prescribe books for such patients as drop in here and are willing to tell me their symptoms. Some people have let their reading faculties decay so that all I can do is hold a post mortem on them."}, {"size": 725, "text": "But most are still open to treatment. There is no one so grateful as the man to whom you have given just the book his soul needed and he never knew it. No advertisement on earth is as potent as a grateful customer. \"I will tell you another reason why I don't advertise,\" he continued. \"In these days when everyone keeps his trademark before the public, as you call it, not to advertise is the most original and startling thing one can do to attract attention. It was the fact that I do NOT advertise that drew you here. And everyone who comes here thinks he has discovered the place himself. He goes and tells his friends about the book asylum run by a crank and a lunatic, and they come here in turn to see what it is like.\""}, {"size": 616, "text": "\"I should like to come here again myself and browse about,\" said the advertising agent. \"I should like to have you prescribe for me.\" \"The first thing needed is to acquire a sense of pity. The world has been printing books for 450 years, and yet gunpowder still has a wider circulation. Never mind! Printer's ink is the greater explosive: it will win. Yes, I have a few of the good books here. There are only about 30,000 really important books in the world. I suppose about 5,000 of them were written in the English language, and 5,000 more have been translated.\" \"You are open in the evenings?\" \"Until ten o'clock."}, {"size": 631, "text": "A great many of my best customers are those who are at work all day and can only visit bookshops at night. The real book-lovers, you know, are generally among the humbler classes. A man who is impassioned with books has little time or patience to grow rich by concocting schemes for cozening his fellows.\" The little bookseller's bald pate shone in the light of the bulb hanging over the wrapping table. His eyes were bright and earnest, his short red beard bristled like wire. He wore a ragged brown Norfolk jacket from which two buttons were missing. A bit of a fanatic himself, thought the customer, but a very entertaining one."}, {"size": 427, "text": "\"Well, sir,\" he said, \"I am ever so grateful to you. I'll come again. Good-night.\" And he started down the aisle for the door. As he neared the front of the shop, Mr. Mifflin switched on a cluster of lights that hung high up, and the young man found himself beside a large bulletin board covered with clippings, announcements, circulars, and little notices written on cards in a small neat script. The following caught his eye:"}, {"size": 750, "text": "If your mind needs phosphorus, try \"Trivia,\" by Logan Pearsall Smith. If your mind needs a whiff of strong air, blue and cleansing, from hilltops and primrose valleys, try \"The Story of My Heart,\" by Richard Jefferies. If your mind needs a tonic of iron and wine, and a thorough rough-and-tumbling, try Samuel Butler's \"Notebooks\" or \"The Man Who Was Thursday,\" by Chesterton. If you need \"all manner of Irish,\" and a relapse into irresponsible freakishness, try \"The Demi-Gods,\" by James Stephens. It is a better book than one deserves or expects. It's a good thing to turn your mind upside down now and then, like an hour-glass, to let the particles run the other way. One who loves the English tongue can have a lot of fun with a Latin dictionary."}, {"size": 626, "text": "Human beings pay very little attention to what is told them unless they know something about it already. The young man had heard of none of these books prescribed by the practitioner of bibliotherapy. He was about to open the door when Mifflin appeared at his side. \"Look here,\" he said, with a quaint touch of embarrassment. \"I was very much interested by our talk. I'm all alone this evening--my wife is away on a holiday. Won't you stay and have supper with me? I was just looking up some new recipes when you came in.\" The other was equally surprised and pleased by this unusual invitation. \"Why--that's very good of you,\""}, {"size": 542, "text": "he said. \"Are you sure I won't be intruding?\" \"Not at all!\" cried the bookseller. \"I detest eating alone: I was hoping someone would drop in. I always try to have a guest for supper when my wife is away. I have to stay at home, you see, to keep an eye on the shop. We have no servant, and I do the cooking myself. It's great fun. Now you light your pipe and make yourself comfortable for a few minutes while I get things ready. Suppose you come back to my den.\" On a table of books at the front of the shop Mifflin laid a large card lettered:"}, {"size": 611, "text": "PROPRIETOR AT SUPPER IF YOU WANT ANYTHING RING THIS BELL Beside the card he placed a large old-fashioned dinner bell, and then led the way to the rear of the shop.Behind the little office in which this unusual merchant had been studying his cook-book a narrow stairway rose on each side, running up to the gallery. Behind these stairs a short flight of steps led to the domestic recesses. The visitor found himself ushered into a small room on the left, where a grate of coals glowed under a dingy mantelpiece of yellowish marble. On the mantel stood a row of blackened corn-cob pipes and a canister of tobacco."}, {"size": 643, "text": "Above was a startling canvas in emphatic oils, representing a large blue wagon drawn by a stout white animal--evidently a horse. A background of lush scenery enhanced the forceful technique of the limner. The walls were stuffed with books. Two shabby, comfortable chairs were drawn up to the iron fender, and a mustard-coloured terrier was lying so close to the glow that a smell of singed hair was sensible. \"There,\" said the host; \"this is my cabinet, my chapel of ease. Take off your coat and sit down.\" \"Really,\" began Gilbert, \"I'm afraid this is----\" \"Nonsense! Now you sit down and commend your soul to Providence and the kitchen stove."}, {"size": 647, "text": "I'll bustle round and get supper.\" Gilbert pulled out his pipe, and with a sense of elation prepared to enjoy an unusual evening. He was a young man of agreeable parts, amiable and sensitive. He knew his disadvantages in literary conversation, for he had gone to an excellent college where glee clubs and theatricals had left him little time for reading. But still he was a lover of good books, though he knew them chiefly by hearsay. He was twenty-five years old, employed as a copywriter by the Grey-Matter Advertising Agency. The little room in which he found himself was plainly the bookseller's sanctum, and contained his own private library."}, {"size": 700, "text": "Gilbert browsed along the shelves curiously. The volumes were mostly shabby and bruised; they had evidently been picked up one by one in the humble mangers of the second-hand vendor. They all showed marks of use and meditation. Mr. Gilbert had the earnest mania for self-improvement which has blighted the lives of so many young men--a passion which, however, is commendable in those who feel themselves handicapped by a college career and a jewelled fraternity emblem. It suddenly struck him that it would be valuable to make a list of some of the titles in Mifflin's collection, as a suggestion for his own reading. He took out a memorandum book and began jotting down the books that intrigued him:"}, {"size": 722, "text": "The Works of Francis Thompson (3 vols.) Social History of Smoking: Apperson The Path to Rome: Hilaire Belloc The Book of Tea: Kakuzo Happy Thoughts: F. C. Burnand Dr. Johnson's Prayers and Meditations Margaret Ogilvy: J. M. Barrie Confessions of a Thug: Taylor General Catalogue of the Oxford University Press The Morning's War: C. E. Montague The Spirit of Man: edited by Robert Bridges The Romany Rye: Borrow Poems: Emily Dickinson Poems: George Herbert The House of Cobwebs: George Gissing So far had he got, and was beginning to say to himself that in the interests of Advertising (who is a jealous mistress) he had best call a halt, when his host entered the room, his small face eager, his eyes blue points of light."}, {"size": 605, "text": "\"Come, Mr. Aubrey Gilbert!\" he cried. \"The meal is set. You want to wash your hands? Make haste then, this way: the eggs are hot and waiting.\" The dining-room into which the guest was conducted betrayed a feminine touch not visible in the smoke-dimmed quarters of shop and cabinet. At the windows were curtains of laughing chintz and pots of pink geranium. The table, under a drop-light in a flame-coloured silk screen, was brightly set with silver and blue china. In a cut-glass decanter sparkled a ruddy brown wine. The edged tool of Advertising felt his spirits undergo an unmistakable upward pressure."}, {"size": 618, "text": "\"Sit down, sir,\" said Mifflin, lifting the roof of a platter. \"These are eggs Samuel Butler, an invention of my own, the apotheosis of hen fruit.\" Gilbert greeted the invention with applause. An Egg Samuel Butler, for the notebook of housewives, may be summarized as a pyramid, based upon toast, whereof the chief masonries are a flake of bacon, an egg poached to firmness, a wreath of mushrooms, a cap-sheaf of red peppers; the whole dribbled with a warm pink sauce of which the inventor retains the secret. To this the bookseller chef added fried potatoes from another dish, and poured for his guest a glass of wine."}, {"size": 653, "text": "\"This is California catawba,\" said Mifflin, \"in which the grape and the sunshine very pleasantly (and cheaply) fulfil their allotted destiny. I pledge you prosperity to the black art of Advertising!\" The psychology of the art and mystery of Advertising rests upon tact, an instinctive perception of the tone and accent which will be en rapport with the mood of the hearer. Mr. Gilbert was aware of this, and felt that quite possibly his host was prouder of his whimsical avocation as gourmet than of his sacred profession as a bookman. \"Is it possible, sir,\" he began, in lucid Johnsonian, \"that you can concoct so delicious an entree in so few minutes?"}, {"size": 615, "text": "You are not hoaxing me? There is no secret passage between Gissing Street and the laboratories of the Ritz?\" \"Ah, you should taste Mrs. Mifflin's cooking!\" said the bookseller. \"I am only an amateur, who dabbles in the craft during her absence. She is on a visit to her cousin in Boston. She becomes, quite justifiably, weary of the tobacco of this establishment, and once or twice a year it does her good to breathe the pure serene of Beacon Hill. During her absence it is my privilege to inquire into the ritual of housekeeping. I find it very sedative after the incessant excitement and speculation of the shop.\""}, {"size": 651, "text": "\"I should have thought,\" said Gilbert, \"that life in a bookshop would be delightfully tranquil.\" \"Far from it. Living in a bookshop is like living in a warehouse of explosives. Those shelves are ranked with the most furious combustibles in the world--the brains of men. I can spend a rainy afternoon reading, and my mind works itself up to such a passion and anxiety over mortal problems as almost unmans me. It is terribly nerve-racking. Surround a man with Carlyle, Emerson, Thoreau, Chesterton, Shaw, Nietzsche, and George Ade--would you wonder at his getting excited? What would happen to a cat if she had to live in a room tapestried with catnip?"}, {"size": 644, "text": "She would go crazy!\" \"Truly, I had never thought of that phase of bookselling,\" said the young man. \"How is it, though, that libraries are shrines of such austere calm? If books are as provocative as you suggest, one would expect every librarian to utter the shrill screams of a hierophant, to clash ecstatic castanets in his silent alcoves!\" \"Ah, my boy, you forget the card index! Librarians invented that soothing device for the febrifuge of their souls, just as I fall back upon the rites of the kitchen. Librarians would all go mad, those capable of concentrated thought, if they did not have the cool and healing card index as medicament!"}, {"size": 704, "text": "Some more of the eggs?\" \"Thank you,\" said Gilbert. \"Who was the butler whose name was associated with the dish?\" \"What?\" cried Mifflin, in agitation, \"you have not heard of Samuel Butler, the author of The Way of All Flesh? My dear young man, whoever permits himself to die before he has read that book, and also Erewhon, has deliberately forfeited his chances of paradise. For paradise in the world to come is uncertain, but there is indeed a heaven on this earth, a heaven which we inhabit when we read a good book. Pour yourself another glass of wine, and permit me----\" (Here followed an enthusiastic development of the perverse philosophy of Samuel Butler, which, in deference to my readers, I omit."}, {"size": 773, "text": "Mr. Gilbert took notes of the conversation in his pocketbook, and I am pleased to say that his heart was moved to a realization of his iniquity, for he was observed at the Public Library a few days later asking for a copy of The Way of All Flesh. After inquiring at four libraries, and finding all copies of the book in circulation, he was compelled to buy one. He never regretted doing so.) \"But I am forgetting my duties as host,\" said Mifflin. \"Our dessert consists of apple sauce, gingerbread, and coffee.\" He rapidly cleared the empty dishes from the table and brought on the second course. \"I have been noticing the warning over the sideboard,\" said Gilbert. \"I hope you will let me help you this evening?\" He pointed to a card hanging near the kitchen door. It read:"}, {"size": 743, "text": "ALWAYS WASH DISHES IMMEDIATELY AFTER MEALS IT SAVES TROUBLE \"I'm afraid I don't always obey that precept,\" said the bookseller as he poured the coffee. \"Mrs. Mifflin hangs it there whenever she goes away, to remind me. But, as our friend Samuel Butler says, he that is stupid in little will also be stupid in much. I have a different theory about dish-washing, and I please myself by indulging it. \"I used to regard dish-washing merely as an ignoble chore, a kind of hateful discipline which had to be undergone with knitted brow and brazen fortitude. When my wife went away the first time, I erected a reading stand and an electric light over the sink, and used to read while my hands went automatically through base gestures of purification."}, {"size": 229, "text": "I made the great spirits of literature partners of my sorrow, and learned by heart a good deal of Paradise Lost and of Walt Mason, while I soused and wallowed among pots and pans. I used to comfort myself with two lines of Keats:"}, {"size": 727, "text": "'The moving waters at their priest-like task Of pure ablution round earth's human shores----' Then a new conception of the matter struck me. It is intolerable for a human being to go on doing any task as a penance, under duress. No matter what the work is, one must spiritualize it in some way, shatter the old idea of it into bits and rebuild it nearer to the heart's desire. How was I to do this with dish-washing? \"I broke a good many plates while I was pondering over the matter. Then it occurred to me that here was just the relaxation I needed. I had been worrying over the mental strain of being surrounded all day long by vociferous books, crying out at me their conflicting views as to the glories and agonies of life."}, {"size": 642, "text": "Why not make dish-washing my balm and poultice? \"When one views a stubborn fact from a new angle, it is amazing how all its contours and edges change shape! Immediately my dishpan began to glow with a kind of philosophic halo! The warm, soapy water became a sovereign medicine to retract hot blood from the head; the homely act of washing and drying cups and saucers became a symbol of the order and cleanliness that man imposes on the unruly world about him. I tore down my book rack and reading lamp from over the sink. \"Mr. Gilbert,\" he went on, \"do not laugh at me when I tell you that I have evolved a whole kitchen philosophy of my own."}, {"size": 654, "text": "I find the kitchen the shrine of our civilization, the focus of all that is comely in life. The ruddy shine of the stove is as beautiful as any sunset. A well-polished jug or spoon is as fair, as complete and beautiful, as any sonnet. The dish mop, properly rinsed and wrung and hung outside the back door to dry, is a whole sermon in itself. The stars never look so bright as they do from the kitchen door after the ice-box pan is emptied and the whole place is 'redd up,' as the Scotch say.\" \"A very delightful philosophy indeed,\" said Gilbert. \"And now that we have finished our meal, I insist upon your letting me give you a hand with the washing up."}, {"size": 651, "text": "I am eager to test this dish-pantheism of yours!\" \"My dear fellow,\" said Mifflin, laying a restraining hand on his impetuous guest, \"it is a poor philosophy that will not abide denial now and then. No, no--I did not ask you to spend the evening with me to wash dishes.\" And he led the way back to his sitting room. \"When I saw you come in,\" said Mifflin, \"I was afraid you might be a newspaper man, looking for an interview. A young journalist came to see us once, with very unhappy results. He wheedled himself into Mrs. Mifflin's good graces, and ended by putting us both into a book, called Parnassus on Wheels, which has been rather a trial to me."}, {"size": 826, "text": "In that book he attributes to me a number of shallow and sugary observations upon bookselling that have been an annoyance to the trade. I am happy to say, though, that his book had only a trifling sale.\" \"I have never heard of it,\" said Gilbert. \"If you are really interested in bookselling you should come here some evening to a meeting of the Corn Cob Club. Once a month a number of booksellers gather here and we discuss matters of bookish concern over corn-cobs and cider. We have all sorts and conditions of booksellers: one is a fanatic on the subject of libraries. He thinks that every public library should be dynamited. Another thinks that moving pictures will destroy the book trade. What rot! Surely everything that arouses people's minds, that makes them alert and questioning, increases their appetite for books.\""}, {"size": 608, "text": "\"The life of a bookseller is very demoralizing to the intellect,\" he went on after a pause. \"He is surrounded by innumerable books; he cannot possibly read them all; he dips into one and picks up a scrap from another. His mind gradually fills itself with miscellaneous flotsam, with superficial opinions, with a thousand half-knowledges. Almost unconsciously he begins to rate literature according to what people ask for. He begins to wonder whether Ralph Waldo Trine isn't really greater than Ralph Waldo Emerson, whether J. M. Chapple isn't as big a man as J. M. Barrie. That way lies intellectual suicide."}, {"size": 643, "text": "\"One thing, however, you must grant the good bookseller. He is tolerant. He is patient of all ideas and theories. Surrounded, engulfed by the torrent of men's words, he is willing to listen to them all. Even to the publisher's salesman he turns an indulgent ear. He is willing to be humbugged for the weal of humanity. He hopes unceasingly for good books to be born. \"My business, you see, is different from most. I only deal in second-hand books; I only buy books that I consider have some honest reason for existence. In so far as human judgment can discern, I try to keep trash out of my shelves. A doctor doesn't traffic in quack remedies."}, {"size": 642, "text": "I don't traffic in bogus books. \"A comical thing happened the other day. There is a certain wealthy man, a Mr. Chapman, who has long frequented this shop----\" \"I wonder if that could be Mr. Chapman of the Chapman Daintybits Company?\" said Gilbert, feeling his feet touch familiar soil. \"The same, I believe,\" said Mifflin. \"Do you know him?\" \"Ah,\" cried the young man with reverence. \"There is a man who can tell you the virtues of advertising. If he is interested in books, it is advertising that made it possible. We handle all his copy--I've written a lot of it myself. We have made the Chapman prunes a staple of civilization and culture."}, {"size": 621, "text": "I myself devised that slogan 'We preen ourselves on our prunes' which you see in every big magazine. Chapman prunes are known the world over. The Mikado eats them once a week. The Pope eats them. Why, we have just heard that thirteen cases of them are to be put on board the George Washington for the President's voyage to the peace Conference. The Czecho-Slovak armies were fed largely on prunes. It is our conviction in the office that our campaign for the Chapman prunes did much to win the war.\" \"I read in an ad the other day--perhaps you wrote that, too?\" said the bookseller, \"that the Elgin watch had won the war."}, {"size": 665, "text": "However, Mr. Chapman has long been one of my best customers. He heard about the Corn Cob Club, and though of course he is not a bookseller he begged to come to our meetings. We were glad to have him do so, and he has entered into our discussions with great zeal. Often he has offered many a shrewd comment. He has grown so enthusiastic about the bookseller's way of life that the other day he wrote to me about his daughter (he is a widower). She has been attending a fashionable girls' school where, he says, they have filled her head with absurd, wasteful, snobbish notions.

I am rather nervous about the experiment, but it is a compliment to the shop, isn't it?\" \"Ye gods,\" cried Gilbert, \"what advertising copy that would make!\" At this point the bell in the shop rang, and Mifflin jumped up. \"This part of the evening is often rather busy,\" he said. \"I'm afraid I'll have to go down on the floor."}, {"size": 648, "text": "Some of my habitues rather expect me to be on hand to gossip about books.\" \"I can't tell you how much I've enjoyed myself,\" said Gilbert. \"I'm going to come again and study your shelves.\" \"Well, keep it dark about the young lady,\" said the bookseller. \"I don't want all you young blades dropping in here to unsettle her mind. If she falls in love with anybody in this shop, it'll have to be Joseph Conrad or John Keats!\" As he passed out, Gilbert saw Roger Mifflin engaged in argument with a bearded man who looked like a college professor. \"Carlyle's Oliver Cromwell?\" he was saying. \"Yes, indeed!

Many a passer-by would stumble down the steps from the street in sheer curiosity; others, familiar visitors, dropped in with the same comfortable emotion that a man feels on entering his club. Roger's custom was to sit at his desk in the rear, puffing his pipe and reading; though if any customer started a conversation, the little man was quick and eager to carry it on. The lion of talk lay only sleeping in him; it was not hard to goad it up."}, {"size": 626, "text": "It may be remarked that all bookshops that are open in the evening are busy in the after-supper hours. Is it that the true book-lovers are nocturnal gentry, only venturing forth when darkness and silence and the gleam of hooded lights irresistibly suggest reading? Certainly night-time has a mystic affinity for literature, and it is strange that the Esquimaux have created no great books. Surely, for most of us, an arctic night would be insupportable without O. Henry and Stevenson. Or, as Roger Mifflin remarked during a passing enthusiasm for Ambrose Bierce, the true noctes ambrosianae are the noctes ambrose bierceianae."}, {"size": 830, "text": "But Roger was prompt in closing Parnassus at ten o'clock. At that hour he and Bock (the mustard-coloured terrier, named for Boccaccio) would make the round of the shop, see that everything was shipshape, empty the ash trays provided for customers, lock the front door, and turn off the lights. Then they would retire to the den, where Mrs. Mifflin was generally knitting or reading. She would brew a pot of cocoa and they would read or talk for half an hour or so before bed. Sometimes Roger would take a stroll along Gissing Street before turning in. All day spent with books has a rather exhausting effect on the mind, and he used to enjoy the fresh air sweeping up the dark Brooklyn streets, meditating some thought that had sprung from his reading, while Bock sniffed and padded along in the manner of an elderly dog at night."}, {"size": 676, "text": "While Mrs. Mifflin was away, however, Roger's routine was somewhat different. After closing the shop he would return to his desk and with a furtive, shamefaced air take out from a bottom drawer an untidy folder of notes and manuscript. This was the skeleton in his closet, his secret sin. It was the scaffolding of his book, which he had been compiling for at least ten years, and to which he had tentatively assigned such different titles as \"Notes on Literature,\" \"The Muse on Crutches,\" \"Books and I,\" and \"What a Young Bookseller Ought to Know.\" It had begun long ago, in the days of his odyssey as a rural book huckster, under the title of \"Literature Among the Farmers,\""}, {"size": 644, "text": "but it had branched out until it began to appear that (in bulk at least) Ridpath would have to look to his linoleum laurels. The manuscript in its present state had neither beginning nor end, but it was growing strenuously in the middle, and hundreds of pages were covered with Roger's minute script. The chapter on \"Ars Bibliopolae,\" or the art of bookselling, would be, he hoped, a classic among generations of book vendors still unborn. Seated at his disorderly desk, caressed by a counterpane of drifting tobacco haze, he would pore over the manuscript, crossing out, interpolating, re-arguing, and then referring to volumes on his shelves."}, {"size": 719, "text": "Bock would snore under the chair, and soon Roger's brain would begin to waver. In the end he would fall asleep over his papers, wake with a cramp about two o'clock, and creak irritably to a lonely bed. All this we mention only to explain how it was that Roger was dozing at his desk about midnight, the evening after the call paid by Aubrey Gilbert. He was awakened by a draught of chill air passing like a mountain brook over his bald pate. Stiffly he sat up and looked about. The shop was in darkness save for the bright electric over his head. Bock, of more regular habit than his master, had gone back to his couch in the kitchen, made of a packing case that had once coffined a set of the Encyclopaedia Britannica."}, {"size": 661, "text": "\"That's funny,\" said Roger to himself. \"Surely I locked the door?\" He walked to the front of the shop, switching on the cluster of lights that hung from the ceiling. The door was ajar, but everything else seemed as usual. Bock, hearing his footsteps, came trotting out from the kitchen, his claws rattling on the bare wooden floor. He looked up with the patient inquiry of a dog accustomed to the eccentricities of his patron. \"I guess I'm getting absent-minded,\" said Roger. \"I must have left the door open.\" He closed and locked it. Then he noticed that the terrier was sniffing in the History alcove, which was at the front of the shop on the left-hand side."}, {"size": 716, "text": "\"What is it, old man?\" said Roger. \"Want something to read in bed?\" He turned on the light in that alcove. Everything appeared normal. Then he noticed a book that projected an inch or so beyond the even line of bindings. It was a fad of Roger's to keep all his books in a flat row on the shelves, and almost every evening at closing time he used to run his palm along the backs of the volumes to level any irregularities left by careless browsers. He put out a hand to push the book into place. Then he stopped. \"Queer again,\" he thought. \"Carlyle's Oliver Cromwell! I looked for that book last night and couldn't find it. When that professor fellow was here. Maybe I'm tired and can't see straight. I'll go to bed.\""}, {"size": 619, "text": "The next day was a date of some moment. Not only was it Thanksgiving Day, with the November meeting of the Corn Cob Club scheduled for that evening, but Mrs. Mifflin had promised to get home from Boston in time to bake a chocolate cake for the booksellers. It was said that some of the members of the club were faithful in attendance more by reason of Mrs. Mifflin's chocolate cake, and the cask of cider that her brother Andrew McGill sent down from the Sabine Farm every autumn, than on account of the bookish conversation.Roger spent the morning in doing a little housecleaning, in preparation for his wife's return."}, {"size": 736, "text": "He was a trifle abashed to find how many mingled crumbs and tobacco cinders had accumulated on the dining-room rug. He cooked himself a modest lunch of lamb chops and baked potatoes, and was pleased by an epigram concerning food that came into his mind. \"It's not the food you dream about that matters,\" he said to himself; \"it's the vittles that walk right in and become a member of the family.\" He felt that this needed a little polishing and rephrasing, but that there was a germ of wit in it. He had a habit of encountering ideas at his solitary meals. After this, he was busy at the sink scrubbing the dishes, when he was surprised by feeling two very competent arms surround him, and a pink gingham apron was thrown over his head."}, {"size": 623, "text": "\"Mifflin,\" said his wife, \"how many times have I told you to put on an apron when you wash up!\" They greeted each other with the hearty, affectionate simplicity of those congenially wedded in middle age.

She kissed Roger's bald head, tied the apron around his shrimpish person, and sat down on a kitchen chair to watch him finish wiping the china. Her cheeks were cool and ruddy from the keen air, her face lit with the tranquil satisfaction of those who have sojourned in the comfortable city of Boston."}, {"size": 654, "text": "\"Well, my dear,\" said Roger, \"this makes it a real Thanksgiving. You look as plump and full of matter as The Home Book of Verse.\" \"I've had a stunning time,\" she said, patting Bock who stood at her knee, imbibing the familiar and mysterious fragrance by which dogs identify their human friends. \"I haven't even heard of a book for three weeks. I did stop in at the Old Angle Book Shop yesterday, just to say hullo to Joe Jillings. He says all booksellers are crazy, but that you are the craziest of the lot.

Out of kindness for herself and her future husband, if she should have one, I want her to learn a little about earning a living. She is nearly nineteen, and I told her if she would try the bookshop job for a while I would take her to Europe for a year afterward."}, {"size": 663, "text": "As I explained to you, I want her to think she is really earning her way. Of course I don't want the routine to be too hard for her, but I do want her to get some idea of what it means to face life on one's own.

You may fool yourself, but you can't fool me. A girl of nineteen doesn't REACT toward things. She explodes. Things don't 'react' anywhere but in Boston and in chemical laboratories.

Not even Helen had ever been permitted to read it; and she had shrewdly judged that it was not in her line, for though she knew perfectly well where he kept it (together with his life insurance policy, some Liberty Bonds, an autograph letter from Charles Spencer Chaplin, and a snapshot of herself taken on their honeymoon) she had never made any attempt to examine it."}, {"size": 160, "text": "\"Well,\" said Helen; \"Titania or no Titania, if the Corn Cobs want their chocolate cake to-night, I must get busy.

Pull up toward the fire. Make free with the cider. The cake's on the table. My wife came back from Boston specially to make it.\""}, {"size": 618, "text": "\"Here's Mrs. Mifflin's health!\" said Mr. Chapman, a quiet little man who had a habit of listening to what he heard. \"I hope she doesn't mind keeping the shop while we celebrate?\" \"Not a bit,\" said Roger. \"She enjoys it.\" \"I see Tarzan of the Apes is running at the Gissing Street movie palace,\" said Gladfist. \"Great stuff.

Why shouldn't they make both?\" This preliminary tilt was interrupted by the arrival of two more visitors, and Roger handed round mugs of cider, pointed to the cake and the basket of pretzels, and lit his corn-cob pipe. The new arrivals were Quincy and Fruehling; the former a clerk in the book department of a vast drygoods store, the latter the owner of a bookshop in the Hebrew quarter of Grand Street--one of the best-stocked shops in the city, though little known to uptown book-lovers."}, {"size": 660, "text": "\"Well,\" said Fruehling, his bright dark eyes sparkling above richly tinted cheek-bones and bushy beard, \"what's the argument?\" \"The usual one,\" said Gladfist, grinning, \"Mifflin confusing merchandise with metaphysics.\" MIFFLIN--Not at all. I am simply saying that it is good business to sell only the best. GLADFIST--Wrong again. You must select your stock according to your customers. Ask Quincy here. Would there be any sense in his loading up his shelves with Maeterlinck and Shaw when the department-store trade wants Eleanor Porter and the Tarzan stuff? Does a country grocer carry the same cigars that are listed on the wine card of a Fifth Avenue hotel?"}, {"size": 892, "text": "Of course not. He gets in the cigars that his trade enjoys and is accustomed to. Bookselling must obey the ordinary rules of commerce. MIFFLIN--A fig for the ordinary rules of commerce! I came over here to Gissing Street to get away from them. My mind would blow out its fuses if I had to abide by the dirty little considerations of supply and demand. As far as I am concerned, supply CREATES demand. GLADFIST--Still, old chap, you have to abide by the dirty little consideration of earning a living, unless someone has endowed you? BENSON--Of course my line of business isn't strictly the same as you fellows'. But a thought that has often occurred to me in selling rare editions may interest you. The customer's willingness to part with his money is usually in inverse ratio to the permanent benefit he expects to derive from what he purchases. MEREDITH--Sounds a bit like John Stuart Mill."}, {"size": 662, "text": "BENSON--Even so, it may be true. Folks will pay a darned sight more to be amused than they will to be exalted. Look at the way a man shells out five bones for a couple of theatre seats, or spends a couple of dollars a week on cigars without thinking of it. Yet two dollars or five dollars for a book costs him positive anguish. The mistake you fellows in the retail trade have made is in trying to persuade your customers that books are necessities. Tell them they're luxuries. That'll get them! People have to work so hard in this life they're shy of necessities. A man will go on wearing a suit until it's threadbare, much sooner than smoke a threadbare cigar."}, {"size": 726, "text": "GLADFIST--Not a bad thought. You know, Mifflin here calls me a material-minded cynic, but by thunder, I think I'm more idealistic than he is. I'm no propagandist incessantly trying to cajole poor innocent customers into buying the kind of book _I_ think they ought to buy. When I see the helpless pathos of most of them, who drift into a bookstore without the slightest idea of what they want or what is worth reading, I would disdain to take advantage of their frailty. They are absolutely at the mercy of the salesman. They will buy whatever he tells them to.

The \"review\" usually turns out to be an ad. I don't think one book-buyer in a thousand knows the difference. MIFFLIN--Your doctrine is pitiless, base, and false!

What would you think of a base public that would go past my shop day after day and let the high-minded occupant die of starvation? MIFFLIN--Your ailment, Jerry, is that you conceive yourself as merely a tradesman. What I'm telling you is that the bookseller is a public servant. He ought to be pensioned by the state. The honour of his profession should compel him to do all he can to spread the distribution of good stuff. QUINCY--I think you forget how much we who deal chiefly in new books are at the mercy of the publishers. We have to stock the new stuff, a large proportion of which is always punk. Why it is punk, goodness knows, because most of the bum books don't sell."}, {"size": 757, "text": "MIFFLIN--Ah, that is a mystery indeed! But I can give you a fair reason. First, because there isn't enough good stuff to go round. Second, because of the ignorance of the publishers, many of whom honestly don't know a good book when they see it. It is a matter of sheer heedlessness in the selection of what they intend to publish. A big drug factory or a manufacturer of a well-known jam spends vast sums of money on chemically assaying and analyzing the ingredients that are to go into his medicines or in gathering and selecting the fruit that is to be stewed into jam. And yet they tell me that the most important department of a publishing business, which is the gathering and sampling of manuscripts, is the least considered and the least remunerated."}, {"size": 617, "text": "I knew a reader for one publishing house: he was a babe recently out of college who didn't know a book from a frat pin. If a jam factory employs a trained chemist, why isn't it worth a publisher's while to employ an expert book analyzer? There are some of them. Look at the fellow who runs the Pacific Monthly's book business for example! He knows a thing or two. CHAPMAN--I think perhaps you exaggerate the value of those trained experts. They are likely to be fourflushers. We had one once at our factory, and as far as I could make out he never thought we were doing good business except when we were losing money."}, {"size": 604, "text": "MIFFLIN--As far as I have been able to observe, making money is the easiest thing in the world. All you have to do is to turn out an honest product, something that the public needs. Then you have to let them know that you have it, and teach them that they need it. They will batter down your front door in their eagerness to get it. But if you begin to hand them gold bricks, if you begin to sell them books built like an apartment house, all marble front and all brick behind, you're cutting your own throat, or rather cutting your own pocket, which is the same thing.

It's rather the custom in our shop to scoff at the book-buying public and call them boobs, but they really want good books--the poor souls don't know how to get them. Still, Jerry has a certain grain of truth to his credit.

Of course the high lights of the picture are cunningly focussed on the stockings of the eminently beautiful lady; but there is always something else in the picture--an automobile or a country house or a Morris chair or a parasol--which makes it just as effective an ad for those goods as it is for the stockings."}, {"size": 392, "text": "Every now and then Phillips sticks a book into his paintings, and I expect the Fifth Avenue book trade benefits by it.

Your shadow is poisonous!\" \"Well, gentlemen,\" said Mr. Chapman, \"I know Mrs. Mifflin wants to be relieved of her post. I vote we adjourn early. Your conversation is always delightful, though I am sometimes a bit uncertain as to the conclusions. My daughter is going to be a bookseller, and I shall look forward to hearing her views on the business.\""}, {"size": 399, "text": "As the guests made their way out through the shop, Mr. Chapman drew Roger aside. \"It's perfectly all right about sending Titania?\" he asked. \"Absolutely,\" said Roger. \"When does she want to come?\" \"Is to-morrow too soon?\" \"The sooner the better. We've got a little spare room upstairs that she can have. I've got some ideas of my own about furnishing it for her. Send her round to-morrow afternoon.\""}, {"size": 723, "text": "The first pipe after breakfast is a rite of some importance to seasoned smokers, and Roger applied the flame to the bowl as he stood at the bottom of the stairs. He blew a great gush of strong blue reek that eddied behind him as he ran up the flight, his mind eagerly meditating the congenial task of arranging the little spare room for the coming employee. Then, at the top of the steps, he found that his pipe had already gone out. \"What with filling my pipe and emptying it, lighting it and relighting it,\" he thought, \"I don't seem to get much time for the serious concerns of life. Come to think of it, smoking, soiling dishes and washing them, talking and listening to other people talk, take up most of life anyway.\""}, {"size": 738, "text": "This theory rather pleased him, so he ran downstairs again to tell it to Mrs. Mifflin. \"Go along and get that room fixed up,\" she said, \"and don't try to palm off any bogus doctrines on me so early in the morning. Housewives have no time for philosophy after breakfast.\" Roger thoroughly enjoyed himself in the task of preparing the guest-room for the new assistant. It was a small chamber at the back of the second storey, opening on to a narrow passage that connected through a door with the gallery of the bookshop. Two small windows commanded a view of the modest roofs of that quarter of Brooklyn, roofs that conceal so many brave hearts, so many baby carriages, so many cups of bad coffee, and so many cartons of the Chapman prunes."}, {"size": 859, "text": "\"By the way,\" he called downstairs, \"better have some of the prunes for supper to-night, just as a compliment to Miss Chapman.\" Mrs. Mifflin preserved a humorous silence. Over these noncommittal summits the bright eye of the bookseller, as he tacked up the freshly ironed muslin curtains Mrs. Mifflin had allotted, could discern a glimpse of the bay and the leviathan ferries that link Staten Island with civilization. \"Just a touch of romance in the outlook,\" he thought to himself. \"It will suffice to keep a blasee young girl aware of the excitements of existence.\" The room, as might be expected in a house presided over by Helen Mifflin, was in perfect order to receive any occupant, but Roger had volunteered to psychologize it in such a fashion as (he thought) would convey favourable influences to the misguided young spirit that was to be its tenant."}, {"size": 642, "text": "Incurable idealist, he had taken quite gravely his responsibility as landlord and employer of Mr. Chapman's daughter. No chambered nautilus was to have better opportunity to expand the tender mansions of its soul. Beside the bed was a bookshelf with a reading lamp. The problem Roger was discussing was what books and pictures might be the best preachers to this congregation of one. To Mrs. Mifflin's secret amusement he had taken down the picture of Sir Galahad which he had once hung there, because (as he had said) if Sir Galahad were living to-day he would be a bookseller. \"We don't want her feasting her imagination on young Galahads,\""}, {"size": 780, "text": "he had remarked at breakfast. \"That way lies premature matrimony. What I want to do is put up in her room one or two good prints representing actual men who were so delightful in their day that all the young men she is likely to see now will seem tepid and prehensile. Thus she will become disgusted with the present generation of youths and there will be some chance of her really putting her mind on the book business.\" Accordingly he had spent some time in going through a bin where he kept photos and drawings of authors that the publishers' \"publicity men\" were always showering upon him. After some thought he discarded promising engravings of Harold Bell Wright and Stephen Leacock, and chose pictures of Shelley, Anthony Trollope, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Robert Burns."}, {"size": 351, "text": "Then, after further meditation, he decided that neither Shelley nor Burns would quite do for a young girl's room, and set them aside in favour of a portrait of Samuel Butler.

This is a question that admits of the utmost nicety of discussion. Some authorities hold that the proper books for a guest-room are of a soporific quality that will induce swift and painless repose. This school advises The Wealth of Nations, Rome under the Caesars, The Statesman's Year Book, certain novels of Henry James, and The Letters of Queen Victoria (in three volumes).

Even ghost stories and harrowing matter are maintained seasonable by these pundits. This class of reading comprises O. Henry, Bret Harte, Leonard Merrick, Ambrose Bierce, W. W. Jacobs, Daudet, de Maupassant, and possibly even On a Slow Train Through Arkansaw, that grievous classic of the railway bookstalls whereof its author, Mr. Thomas W.

His brother-in-law, Andrew McGill, the writer, once gave him for Christmas (just to annoy him) a copy of On a Slow Train Through Arkansaw sumptuously bound and gilded in what is known to the trade as \"dove-coloured ooze.\" Roger retorted by sending Andrew (for his next birthday) two volumes of Brann the Iconoclast bound in what Robert Cortes Holliday calls \"embossed toadskin.\" But that is apart from the story."}, {"size": 643, "text": "To the consideration of what to put on Miss Titania's bookshelf Roger devoted the delighted hours of the morning. Several times Helen called him to come down and attend to the shop, but he was sitting on the floor, unaware of numbed shins, poring over the volumes he had carted upstairs for a final culling. \"It will be a great privilege,\" he said to himself, \"to have a young mind to experiment with.

He would have gone about his affairs with a new and surprised conviction that the Almighty had the borough of Brooklyn under His especial care.

He says I'm impossible. I suppose this is the literature he talks about. I want to know all about it.\" \"And here's Bock!\" she cried. \"Dad says he's the greatest dog in the world, named after Botticelli or somebody. I've brought him a present. It's in my bag.

He can show you round the shop and tell you where all the books are.\" \"Before we begin,\" said Titania, \"just let me give Bock his present.\" She showed a large package of tissue paper and, unwinding innumerable layers, finally disclosed a stalwart bone. \"I was lunching at Sherry's, and I made the head waiter give me this. He was awfully amused.\" \"Come along into the kitchen and give it to him,\""}, {"size": 662, "text": "said Helen. \"He'll be your friend for life.\" \"What an adorable kennel!\" cried Titania, when she saw the remodelled packing-case that served Bock as a retreat. The bookseller's ingenious carpentry had built it into the similitude of a Carnegie library, with the sign READING-ROOM over the door; and he had painted imitation book-shelves along the interior. \"You'll get used to Mr. Mifflin after a while,\" said Helen amusedly. \"He spent all one winter getting that kennel fixed to his liking.

I'm awfully keen about elevators.\" \"Bless me,\" said Roger, \"You'll find this very different from Lord and Taylor's! We haven't any elevators, or any sales slips, or even a cash register.

If someone comes in to sell books, you must refer him to me. You mustn't be surprised to see people drop in here and spend several hours reading. Lots of them look on this as a kind of club. I hope you don't mind the smell of tobacco, for almost all the men that come here smoke in the shop. You see, I put ash trays around for them.\" \"I love tobacco smell,\" said Titania. \"Daddy's library at home smells something like this, but not quite so strong.

Until then I just want you to poke around and see what there is, until you know the shelves so well you could put your hand on any given book in the dark. That's a game my wife and I used to play. We would turn off all the lights at night, and I would call out the title of a book and see how near she could come to finding it. Then I would take a turn.

I get him a little mixed up with the Deity, I fear. But he's a bit too hard for you to tackle.\" Titania was puzzled, and said nothing. But her busy mind made a note of its own: Hardy, hard to read, makes one ill, try it. \"What did you think of the books I put in your room?\" said Roger. He had vowed to wait until she made some comment unsolicited, but he could not restrain himself. \"In my room?\" she said. \"Why, I'm sorry, I never noticed them!\""}, {"size": 749, "text": "The Disappearing Volume \"Well, my dear,\" said Roger after supper that evening, \"I think perhaps we had better introduce Miss Titania to our custom of reading aloud.\" \"Perhaps it would bore her?\" said Helen. \"You know it isn't everybody that likes being read to.\" \"Oh, I should love it!\" exclaimed Titania. \"I don't think anybody ever read to me, that is not since I was a child.\" \"Suppose we leave you to look after the shop,\" said Helen to Roger, in a teasing mood, \"and I'll take Titania out to the movies.

He then vanished into the kitchen with his wife, whence Titania heard the cheerful clank of crockery in a dishpan and the splashing of hot water. \"The best thing about washing up,\" she heard Roger say, \"is that it makes one's hands so clean, a novel sensation for a second-hand bookseller.\" She gave Sartor Resartus what is graphically described as a \"once over,\" and then seeing the morning Times lying on the table, picked it up, as she had not read it.

Then the next night, Wednesday, I was up very late writing, and fell asleep at my desk. I must have left the front door ajar, because I was waked up by the draught, and when I went to close the door I saw the book sticking out a little beyond the others, in its usual place.

I tried to read it once, you talked so much about it, and I found it dreadfully dull.\" \"If he did steal it,\" cried the bookseller, \"I'm perfectly delighted. It shows that my contention is right: people DO really care for good books. If an assistant chef is so fond of good books that he has to steal them, the world is safe for democracy.

My dear, would it bore you if we had a go at the old Christmas Stories?\" Mrs. Mifflin held up her hands in mock dismay. \"He reads them to me every year at this time,\" she said to Titania. \"Still, they're worth it."}, {"size": 732, "text": "I know good old Mrs. Lirriper better than I do most of my friends.\" \"What is it, the Christmas Carol?\" said Titania. \"We had to read that in school.\" \"No,\" said Roger; \"the other stories, infinitely better. Everybody gets the Carol dinned into them until they're weary of it, but no one nowadays seems to read the others. I tell you, Christmas wouldn't be Christmas to me if I didn't read these tales over again every year. How homesick they make one for the good old days of real inns and real beefsteak and real ale drawn in pewter.

I'll grant you, though, that lunchroom food is mighty good. The best place to eat is always a counter where the chauffeurs congregate. They get awfully hungry, you see, driving round in the cold, and when they want food they want it hot and tasty.

It's a quotation from Joseph Conrad about advertising.\" \"Good enough,\" said Aubrey. \"And I've got something for you. You were so nice to me the other evening I took the liberty of bringing you round some tobacco. Here's a tin of Blue-Eyed Mixture, it's my favourite. I hope you'll like it.\" \"Bully for you. Perhaps I ought to let you off the Conrad quotation since you're so kind.\" \"Not a bit. I suppose it's a knock.

It's rather interesting how it all works out. You see, after you told me the other day that Miss Chapman was coming to work for you, that gave me an idea. I knew her father would be specially interested in Brooklyn, on that account, and it suggested to me an idea for a window-display campaign here in Brooklyn for the Daintybits Products. You know we handle all his sales promotion campaigns. Of course I didn't let on that I knew about his daughter coming over here, but he told me about it himself in the course of our talk. Well, here's what I'm getting at.

He looked at me as though I'd run a carving knife into him, almost scared me the way he looked. \"Yes, yes,\" he said, and shoved the book out of sight under his arm. He seemed half angry and half frightened, so I thought maybe he had no right to be riding in the passenger elevator and was scared someone would report him to the manager.

I had a long talk with Mr. Chapman, and we discussed some plans for a prune and Saratoga chip campaign, and I showed him some suggested copy I had prepared. Then he told me about his daughter, and I let on that I knew you.

He got off the same train I did. He had on civilian clothes then, of course, and when he was out of his white uniform and pancake hat I recognized him right off. Who do you suppose it was?\" \"Can't imagine,\" said Roger, highly interested by this time. \"Why, the professor-looking guy who came in to ask for the book the first night I was here.\" \"Humph! Well, he must be keen about Carlyle, because he was horribly disappointed that evening when he asked for the book and I couldn't find it. I remember how he insisted that I MUST have it, and I hunted all through the History shelves to make sure it hadn't got misplaced."}, {"size": 645, "text": "He said that some friend of his had seen it here, and he had come right round to buy it.

I stopped in at the drug store on the corner to get some matches, and when I came out, there he was underneath the lamp-post.\" \"If it was a modern author, instead of Carlyle,\" said Roger, \"I'd say it was some publicity stunt pulled off by the publishers.

The young man made some feeble demur, but it was obvious to the bookseller that he was vastly elated at the idea of making Miss Chapman's acquaintance. \"Here's a friend of mine,\" said Roger, ushering Aubrey into the little room where Helen and Titania were still sitting by the fire. \"Mrs. Mifflin, Mr. Aubrey Gilbert, Miss Chapman, Mr. Gilbert.\""}, {"size": 602, "text": "Aubrey was vaguely aware of the rows of books, of the shining coals, of the buxom hostess and the friendly terrier; but with the intense focus of an intelligent young male mind these were all merely appurtenances to the congenial spectacle of the employee. How quickly a young man's senses assemble and assimilate the data that are really relevant! Without seeming even to look in that direction he had performed the most amazing feat of lightning calculation known to the human faculties. He had added up all the young ladies of his acquaintance, and found the sum total less than the girl before him."}, {"size": 660, "text": "He had subtracted the new phenomenon from the universe as he knew it, including the solar system and the advertising business, and found the remainder a minus quantity.

All of which transpired in the length of time necessary for Roger to push forward another chair. With the politeness desirable in a well-bred youth, Aubrey's first instinct was to make himself square with the hostess."}, {"size": 637, "text": "Resolutely he occluded blue eyes, silk shirtwaist, and admirable chin from his mental vision. \"It's awfully good of you to let me come in,\" he said to Mrs. Mifflin. \"I was here the other evening and Mr. Mifflin insisted on my staying to supper with him.\" \"I'm very glad to see you,\" said Helen. \"Roger told me about you. I hope he didn't poison you with any of his outlandish dishes.

Fearing to blow out a fuse, he turned in panic to Mrs. Mifflin. \"You see,\" he explained, \"I write a good deal of Mr. Chapman's advertising for him. We had an appointment to discuss some business matters. We're planning a big barrage on prunes.\" \"Dad works much too hard, don't you think?\""}, {"size": 629, "text": "said Titania.

I had no idea the book business was so exciting.\" \"Better lock the door to-night, Roger,\" said Mrs. Mifflin, \"or he may walk off with a set of the Encyclopaedia Britannica.\" \"Why, my dear,\" said Roger, \"I think this is grand news.

I must write to the Publishers' Weekly about it.\" \"Well,\" said Aubrey, \"you mustn't let me interrupt your little party.\" \"You're not interrupting,\" said Roger. \"We were only reading aloud. Do you know Dickens' Christmas Stories?\" \"I'm afraid I don't.\" \"Suppose we go on reading, shall we?\""}, {"size": 665, "text": "\"Yes, do go on,\" said Titania. \"Mr. Mifflin was just reading about a most adorable head waiter in a London chop house.\" Aubrey begged permission to light his pipe, and Roger picked up the book. \"But before we read the items of the coffee-room bill,\" he said, \"I think it only right that we should have a little refreshment. This passage should never be read without something to accompany it. My dear, what do you say to a glass of sherry all round?\" \"It is sad to have to confess it,\" said Mrs. Mifflin to Titania, \"Mr. Mifflin can never read Dickens without having something to drink. I think the sale of Dickens will fall off terribly when prohibition comes in.\""}, {"size": 707, "text": "\"I once took the trouble to compile a list of the amount of liquor drunk in Dickens' works,\" said Roger, \"and I assure you the total was astounding: 7,000 hogsheads, I believe it was. Calculations of that sort are great fun. I have always intended to write a little essay on the rainstorms in the stories of Robert Louis Stevenson. You see R. L. S. was a Scot, and well acquainted with wet weather. Excuse me a moment, I'll just run down cellar and get up a bottle.\" Roger left the room, and they heard his steps passing down into the cellar. Bock, after the manner of dogs, followed him. The smells of cellars are a rare treat to dogs, especially ancient Brooklyn cellars which have a cachet all their own."}, {"size": 650, "text": "The cellar of the Haunted Bookshop was, to Bock, a fascinating place, illuminated by a warm glow from the furnace, and piled high with split packing-cases which Roger used as kindling. From below came the rasp of a shovel among coal, and the clear, musical slither as the lumps were thrown from the iron scoop onto the fire. Just then the bell rang in the shop. \"Let me go,\" said Titania, jumping up. \"Can't I?\" said Aubrey. \"Nonsense!\" said Mrs. Mifflin, laying down her knitting. \"Neither of you knows anything about the stock. Sit down and be comfortable. I'll be right back.\" Aubrey and Titania looked at each other with a touch of embarrassment."}, {"size": 665, "text": "\"Your father sent you his--his kind regards,\" said Aubrey. That was not what he had intended to say, but somehow he could not utter the word. \"He said not to read all the books at once.\" Titania laughed. \"How funny that you should run into him just when you were coming here. He's a duck, isn't he?\" \"Well, you see I only know him in a business way, but he certainly is a corker. He believes in advertising, too.\" \"Are you crazy about books?\" \"Why, I never really had very much to do with them. I'm afraid you'll think I'm terribly ignorant----\" \"Not at all. I'm awfully glad to meet someone who doesn't think it's a crime not to have read all the books there are.\""}, {"size": 620, "text": "\"This is a queer kind of place, isn't it?\" \"Yes, it's a funny idea to call it the Haunted Bookshop. I wonder what it means.\" \"Mr. Mifflin told me it meant haunted by the ghosts of great literature. I hope they won't annoy you. The ghost of Thomas Carlyle seems to be pretty active.\" \"I'm not afraid of ghosts,\" said Titania. Aubrey gazed at the fire. He wanted to say that he intended from now on to do a little haunting on his own account but he did not know just how to break it gently. And then Roger returned from the cellar with the bottle of sherry. As he was uncorking it, they heard the shop door close, and Mrs."}, {"size": 606, "text": "Mifflin came in. \"Well, Roger,\" she said; \"if you think so much of your old Cromwell, you'd better keep it in here.

Here we are, all hands drink the health of Mr. Thomas Carlyle.\" The toast was drunk, and they settled themselves in their chairs. \"And here's to the new employee,\" said Helen. This also was dispatched, Aubrey draining his glass with a zeal which did not escape Miss Chapman's discerning eye. Roger then put out his hand for the Dickens. But first he picked up his beloved Cromwell. He looked at it carefully, and then held the volume close to the light."}, {"size": 676, "text": "\"The mystery's not over yet,\" he said. \"It's been rebound. This isn't the original binding.\" \"Are you sure?\" said Helen in surprise. \"It looks the same.\" \"The binding has been cleverly imitated, but it can't fool me. In the first place, there was a rubbed corner at the top; and there was an ink stain on one of the end papers.\" \"There's still a stain there,\" said Aubrey, looking over his shoulder. \"Yes, but not the same stain. I've had that book long enough to know it by heart. Now what the deuce would that lunatic want to have it rebound for?\" \"Goodness gracious,\" said Helen, \"put it away and forget about it.

He was not thinking: he was being thought. Down the accustomed channels of his intellect he felt his mind ebbing with the irresistible movement of tides drawn by the blandishing moon.

His manner, however, was that of one anxious to please. Aubrey indicated the brand of cigarettes he wanted. Having himself coined the advertising catchword for them--They're mild--but they satisfy--he felt a certain loyal compulsion always to smoke this kind. The druggist held out the packet, and Aubrey noticed that his fingers were stained a deep saffron colour."}, {"size": 606, "text": "\"I see you're a cigarette smoker, too,\" said Aubrey pleasantly, as he opened the packet and lit one of the paper tubes at a little alcohol flame burning in a globe of blue glass on the counter. \"Me?

It was Advertising that had done this--that had enabled Mr. Chapman, a shy and droll little person, to surround this girl with all the fructifying glories of civilization--to foster and cherish her until she shone upon the earth like a morning star!"}, {"size": 670, "text": "Advertising had clothed her, Advertising had fed her, schooled, roofed, and sheltered her. In a sense she was the crowning advertisement of her father's career, and her innocent perfection taunted him just as much as the bright sky-sign he knew was flashing the words CHAPMAN PRUNES above the teeming pavements of Times Square. He groaned to think that he himself, by his conscientious labours, had helped to put this girl in such a position that he could hardly dare approach her. He would never have approached her again, on any pretext, if the intensity of his thoughts had not caused him, unconsciously, to grip the railing of the bridge with strong and angry hands."}, {"size": 774, "text": "For at that moment a sack was thrown over his head from behind and he was violently seized by the legs, with the obvious intent of hoisting him over the parapet. His unexpected grip on the railing delayed this attempt just long enough to save him. Swept off his feet by the fury of the assault, he fell sideways against the barrier and had the good fortune to seize his enemy by the leg. Muffled in the sacking, it was vain to cry out; but he held furiously to the limb he had grasped and he and his attacker rolled together on the footway. Aubrey was a powerful man, and even despite the surprise could probably have got the better of the situation; but as he wrestled desperately and tried to rid himself of his hood, a crashing blow fell upon his head, half stunning him."}, {"size": 675, "text": "He lay sprawled out, momentarily incapable of struggle, yet conscious enough to expect, rather curiously, the dizzying sensation of a drop through insupportable air into the icy water of the East River. Hands seized him--and then, passively, he heard a shout, the sound of footsteps running on the planks, and other footsteps hurrying away at top speed. In a moment the sacking was torn from his head and a friendly pedestrian was kneeling beside him. \"Say, are you all right?\" said the latter anxiously. \"Gee, those guys nearly got you.\" Aubrey was too faint and dizzy to speak for a moment. His head was numb and he felt certain that several inches of it had been caved in."}, {"size": 601, "text": "Putting up his hand, feebly, he was surprised to find the contours of his skull much the same as usual. The stranger propped him against his knee and wiped away a trickle of blood with his handkerchief. \"Say, old man, I thought you was a goner,\" he said sympathetically. \"I seen those fellows jump you. Too bad they got away. Dirty work, I'll say so.\" Aubrey gulped the night air, and sat up. The bridge rocked under him; against the star-speckled sky he could see the Woolworth Building bending and jazzing like a poplar tree in a gale. He felt very sick. \"Ever so much obliged to you,\" he stammered."}, {"size": 611, "text": "\"I'll be all right in a minute.\" \"D'you want me to go and ring up a nambulance?\" said his assistant. \"No, no,\" said Aubrey; \"I'll be all right.\" He staggered to his feet and clung to the rail of the bridge, trying to collect his wits. One phrase ran over and over in his mind with damnable iteration--\"Mild, but they satisfy!\" \"Where were you going?\" said the other, supporting him. \"Madison Avenue and Thirty-Second----\" \"Maybe I can flag a jitney for you. Here,\" he cried, as another citizen approached afoot, \"Give this fellow a hand. Someone beat him over the bean with a club. I'm going to get him a lift.\""}, {"size": 617, "text": "The newcomer readily undertook the friendly task, and tied Aubrey's handkerchief round his head, which was bleeding freely. After a few moments the first Samaritan succeeded in stopping a touring car which was speeding over from Brooklyn. The driver willingly agreed to take Aubrey home, and the other two helped him in. Barring a nasty gash on his scalp he was none the worse. \"A fellow needs a tin hat if he's going to wander round Long Island at night,\" said the motorist genially. \"Two fellows tried to hold me up coming in from Rockville Centre the other evening. Maybe they were the same two that picked on you."}, {"size": 719, "text": "Did you get a look at them?\" \"No,\" said Aubrey. \"That piece of sacking might have helped me trace them, but I forgot it.\" \"Want to run back for it?\" \"Never mind,\" said Aubrey. \"I've got a hunch about this.\" \"Think you know who it is? Maybe you're in politics, hey?\" The car ran swiftly up the dark channel of the Bowery, into Fourth Avenue, and turned off at Thirty-Second Street to deposit Aubrey in front of his boarding house. He thanked his convoy heartily, and refused further assistance. After several false shots he got his latch key in the lock, climbed four creaking flights, and stumbled into his room. Groping his way to the wash-basin, he bathed his throbbing head, tied a towel round it, and fell into bed."}, {"size": 652, "text": "Titania Learns the Business Although he kept late hours, Roger Mifflin was a prompt riser. It is only the very young who find satisfaction in lying abed in the morning. Those who approach the term of the fifth decade are sensitively aware of the fluency of life, and have no taste to squander it among the blankets.The bookseller's morning routine was brisk and habitual. He was generally awakened about half-past seven by the jangling bell that balanced on a coiled spring at the foot of the stairs. This ringing announced the arrival of Becky, the old scrubwoman who came each morning to sweep out the shop and clean the floors for the day's traffic."}, {"size": 709, "text": "Roger, in his old dressing gown of vermilion flannel, would scuffle down to let her in, picking up the milk bottles and the paper bag of baker's rolls at the same time. As Becky propped the front door wide, opened window transoms, and set about buffeting dust and tobacco smoke, Roger would take the milk and rolls back to the kitchen and give Bock a morning greeting. Bock would emerge from his literary kennel, and thrust out his forelegs in a genial obeisance. This was partly politeness, and partly to straighten out his spine after its all-night curvature. Then Roger would let him out into the back yard for a run, himself standing on the kitchen steps to inhale the bright freshness of the morning air."}, {"size": 641, "text": "This Saturday morning was clear and crisp. The plain backs of the homes along Whittier Street, irregular in profile as the margins of a free verse poem, offered Roger an agreeable human panorama. Thin strands of smoke were rising from chimneys; a belated baker's wagon was joggling down the alley; in bedroom bay-windows sheets and pillows were already set to sun and air. Brooklyn, admirable borough of homes and hearty breakfasts, attacks the morning hours in cheery, smiling spirit. Bock sniffed and rooted about the small back yard as though the earth (every cubic inch of which he already knew by rote) held some new entrancing flavour."}, {"size": 708, "text": "Roger watched him with the amused and tender condescension one always feels toward a happy dog--perhaps the same mood of tolerant paternalism that Gott is said to have felt in watching his boisterous Hohenzollerns. The nipping air began to infiltrate his dressing gown, and Roger returned to the kitchen, his small, lively face alight with zest. He opened the draughts in the range, set a kettle on to boil, and went down to resuscitate the furnace. As he came upstairs for his bath, Mrs. Mifflin was descending, fresh and hearty in a starchy morning apron. Roger hummed a tune as he picked up the hairpins on the bedroom floor, and wondered to himself why women are always supposed to be more tidy than men."}, {"size": 651, "text": "Titania was awake early. She smiled at the enigmatic portrait of Samuel Butler, glanced at the row of books over her bed, and dressed rapidly. She ran downstairs, eager to begin her experience as a bookseller. The first impression the Haunted Bookshop had made on her was one of superfluous dinginess, and as Mrs. Mifflin refused to let her help get breakfast--except set out the salt cellars--she ran down Gissing Street to a little florist's shop she had noticed the previous afternoon. Here she spent at least a week's salary in buying chrysanthemums and a large pot of white heather. She was distributing these about the shop when Roger found her."}, {"size": 701, "text": "\"Bless my soul!\" he said. \"How are you going to live on your wages if you do that sort of thing?

Think how pleased your floorwalker will be when he comes in!\" \"Dear me,\" said Roger. \"I hope you don't really think we have floorwalkers in the second-hand book business.\" After breakfast he set about initiating his new employee into the routine of the shop.

That's one of the reasons why I tell Mr. Gilbert I don't believe in advertising. Someone may ask you who wrote The Winning of the Best, and you'll have to know it wasn't Colonel Roosevelt but Mr. Ralph Waldo Trine. The beauty of being a bookseller is that you don't have to be a literary critic: all you have to do to books is enjoy them."}, {"size": 735, "text": "A literary critic is the kind of fellow who will tell you that Wordsworth's Happy Warrior is a poem of 85 lines composed entirely of two sentences, one of 26 lines and one of 59. What does it matter if Wordsworth wrote sentences almost as long as those of Walt Whitman or Mr. Will H. Hays, if only he wrote a great poem? Literary critics are queer birds. There's Professor Phelps of Yale, for instance. He publishes a book in 1918 and calls it The Advance of English Poetry in the Twentieth Century. To my way of thinking a book of that title oughtn't to be published until 2018. Then somebody will come along and ask you for a book of poems about a typewriter, and by and by you'll learn that what they want is Stevenson's Underwoods."}, {"size": 637, "text": "Yes, it's a complicated life. Never argue with customers. Just give them the book they ought to have even if they don't know they want it.\" They went outside the front door, and Roger lit his pipe. In the little area in front of the shop windows stood large empty boxes supported on trestles. \"The first thing I always do----,\" he said. \"The first thing you'll both do is catch your death of cold,\" said Helen over his shoulder. \"Titania, you run and get your fur.

He felt very talkative, as most older men do when a young girl looks as delightfully listenable as Titania. \"What an adorable little place,\" said Titania, looking round at the bookshop's space of private pavement, which was sunk below the street level. \"You could put tables out here and serve tea in summer time.\" \"The first thing every morning,\" continued Roger, \"I set out the ten-cent stuff in these boxes. I take it in at night and stow it in these bins. When it rains, I shove out an awning, which is mighty good business."}, {"size": 631, "text": "Someone is sure to take shelter, and spend the time in looking over the books. A really heavy shower is often worth fifty or sixty cents. Once a week I change my pavement stock. This week I've got mostly fiction out here. That's the sort of thing that comes in in unlimited numbers. A good deal of it's tripe, but it serves its purpose.\" \"Aren't they rather dirty?\" said Titania doubtfully, looking at some little blue Rollo books, on which the siftings of generations had accumulated. \"Would you mind if I dusted them off a bit?\" \"It's almost unheard of in the second-hand trade,\" said Roger; \"but it might make them look better.\""}, {"size": 653, "text": "Titania ran inside, borrowed a duster from Helen, and began housecleaning the grimy boxes, while Roger chatted away in high spirits. Bock already noticing the new order of things, squatted on the doorstep with an air of being a party to the conversation. Morning pedestrians on Gissing Street passed by, wondering who the bookseller's engaging assistant might be. \"I wish _I_ could find a maid like that,\" thought a prosperous Brooklyn housewife on her way to market. \"I must ring her up some day and find out how much she gets.\" Roger brought out armfuls of books while Titania dusted. \"One of the reasons I'm awfully glad you've come here to help me,\""}, {"size": 697, "text": "he said, \"is that I'll be able to get out more.

If you just wait for what comes in, you don't get much of the really good stuff.\" Titania was polishing a copy of The Late Mrs. Null. \"It must be wonderful to have read so many books,\" she said. \"I'm afraid I'm not a very deep reader, but at any rate Dad has taught me a respect for good books. He gets so mad because when my friends come to the house, and he asks them what they've been reading, the only thing they seem to know about is Dere Mable.\""}, {"size": 747, "text": "Roger chuckled. \"I hope you don't think I'm a mere highbrow,\" he said. \"As a customer said to me once, without meaning to be funny, 'I like both the Iliad and the Argosy.' The only thing I can't stand is literature that is unfairly and intentionally flavoured with vanilla. Confectionery soon disgusts the palate, whether you find it in Marcus Aurelius or Doctor Crane. There's an odd aspect of the matter that sometimes strikes me: Doc Crane's remarks are just as true as Lord Bacon's, so how is it that the Doctor puts me to sleep in a paragraph, while my Lord's essays keep me awake all night?\" Titania, being unacquainted with these philosophers, pursued the characteristic feminine course of clinging to the subject on which she was informed."}, {"size": 688, "text": "The undiscerning have called this habit of mind irrelevant, but wrongly.

I'm afraid I haven't read Dere Mable. If it's really amusing, I'm glad they read it. I suspect it isn't a very great book, because a Philadelphia schoolgirl has written a reply to it called Dere Bill, which is said to be as good as the original."}, {"size": 634, "text": "Now you can hardly imagine a Philadelphia flapper writing an effective companion to Bacon's Essays. But never mind, if the stuff's amusing, it has its place. The human yearning for innocent pastime is a pathetic thing, come to think about it. It shows what a desperately grim thing life has become. One of the most significant things I know is that breathless, expectant, adoring hush that falls over a theatre at a Saturday matinee, when the house goes dark and the footlights set the bottom of the curtain in a glow, and the latecomers tank over your feet climbing into their seats----\" \"Isn't it an adorable moment!\" cried Titania."}, {"size": 731, "text": "\"Yes, it is,\" said Roger; \"but it makes me sad to see what tosh is handed out to that eager, expectant audience, most of the time. There they all are, ready to be thrilled, eager to be worked upon, deliberately putting themselves into that glorious, rare, receptive mood when they are clay in the artist's hand--and Lord! what miserable substitutes for joy and sorrow are put over on them! Day after day I see people streaming into theatres and movies, and I know that more than half the time they are on a blind quest, thinking they are satisfied when in truth they are fed on paltry husks. And the sad part about it is that if you let yourself think you are satisfied with husks, you'll have no appetite left for the real grain.\""}, {"size": 639, "text": "Titania wondered, a little panic-stricken, whether she had been permitting herself to be satisfied with husks.

And if they laugh and look happy, surely they're amused?\" \"They only think they are!\" cried Mifflin. \"They think they're amused because they don't know what real amusement is! Laughter and prayer are the two noblest habits of man; they mark us off from the brutes. To laugh at cheap jests is as base as to pray to cheap gods. To laugh at Fatty Arbuckle is to degrade the human spirit.\""}, {"size": 647, "text": "Titania thought she was getting in rather deep, but she had the tenacious logic of every healthy girl.

Humanity is yearning now as it never did before for truth, for beauty, for the things that comfort and console and make life seem worth while."}, {"size": 609, "text": "I feel this all round me, every day. We've been through a frightful ordeal, and every decent spirit is asking itself what we can do to pick up the fragments and remould the world nearer to our heart's desire.

A carelessness of life and beauty marks the glutton, the idler, and the fool in their deadly path across history.'

Wondered if the world were still merely a jungle of fury. I think I'd have gone balmy if it weren't for Walt Whitman.

The war contradicted and denied everything I had ever lived for. Oh, I can't tell you how I felt about it. I can't even express it to myself. Sometimes I used to feel as I think that truly noble simpleton Henry Ford may have felt when he organized his peace voyage--that I would do anything, however stupid, to stop it all. In a world where everyone was so wise and cynical and cruel, it was admirable to find a man so utterly simple and hopeful as Henry. A boob, they called him. Well, I say bravo for boobs! I daresay most of the apostles were boobs--or maybe they called them bolsheviks.\" Titania had only the vaguest notion about bolsheviks, but she had seen a good many newspaper cartoons. \"I guess Judas was a bolshevik,\" she said innocently."}, {"size": 681, "text": "\"Yes, and probably George the Third called Ben Franklin a bolshevik,\" retorted Roger. \"The trouble is, truth and falsehood don't come laid out in black and white--Truth and Huntruth, as the wartime joke had it. Sometimes I thought Truth had vanished from the earth,\" he cried bitterly. \"Like everything else, it was rationed by the governments. I taught myself to disbelieve half of what I read in the papers. I saw the world clawing itself to shreds in blind rage. I saw hardly any one brave enough to face the brutalizing absurdity as it really was, and describe it. I saw the glutton, the idler, and the fool applauding, while brave and simple men walked in the horrors of hell."}, {"size": 654, "text": "The stay-at-home poets turned it to pretty lyrics of glory and sacrifice.

Don't you suppose the Germans thought they too were marching off for a noble cause when they began it and forced this misery on the world? They had been educated to believe so, for a generation.

Our motto over there will be America Last! Hurrah for us, I say, for we shall be the only nation over there with absolutely no axe to grind.

The first thing you'll find, when the Peace Conference gets to work, will be that we shall have to help Germany onto her feet again so that she can be punished in an orderly way. We shall have to feed her and admit her to commerce so that she can pay her indemnities--we shall have to police her cities to prevent revolution from burning her up--and the upshot of it all will be that men will have fought the most terrible war in history, and endured nameless horrors, for the privilege of nursing their enemy back to health."}, {"size": 442, "text": "If that isn't an absurdity, what is?

I never realized the greatness of the human spirit, the indomitable grandeur of man's mind, until I read Milton's Areopagitica.

When you read that book you can feel it blowing up your mind. It leaves you gasping, ill, nauseated--oh, it's not pleasant to feel some really pure intellect filtered into one's brain! It hurts!

Pleasure coincided with duty in that the outer wing of the party placed him next to Titania. \"Well, how do you like bookselling?\" he asked. \"Oh, it's the greatest fun!\" she cried. \"But it'll take me ever and ever so long to learn about all the books.

Entranced as he was by the proximity of Miss Chapman, Aubrey noticed that the druggist eyed him rather queerly. And being of a noticing habit, he also observed that when Weintraub had occasion to write out a label for a box of powdered alum Mrs. Mifflin was buying, he did so with a pale violet ink.

Unknown to her, his arm extended behind her like an iron rod to absorb the onward impulses of the eager throng. A rustling groan ran through these enthusiasts as they saw the preliminary footage of the great Tarzan flash onto the screen, and realized they were missing something.

Was not he, too--he thought naively--a poor Tarzan of the advertising jungle, lost among the elephants and alligators of commerce, and sighing for this dainty and unattainable vision of girlhood that had burst upon his burning gaze! He stole a perilous side-glance at her profile, and saw the racing flicker of the screen reflected in tiny spangles of light that danced in her eyes. He was even so unknowing as to imagine that she was not aware of his contemplation."}, {"size": 690, "text": "And then the lights went up. \"What nonsense, wasn't it?\" said Titania. \"I'm so glad it's over! I was quite afraid one of those elephants would walk off the screen and tread on us.\" \"I never can understand,\" said Helen, \"why they don't film some of the really good books--think of Frank Stockton's stuff, how delightful that would be. Can't you imagine Mr. and Mrs. Drew playing in Rudder Grange!\" \"Thank goodness!\" said Titania. \"Since I entered the book business, that's the first time anybody's mentioned a book that I've read.

Then the organ began to play \"O How I Hate To Get Up in the Morning\" and the ever-delightful Mr. and Mrs. Drew appeared on the screen in one of their domestic comedies. Lovers of the movies may well date a new screen era from the day those whimsical pantomimers set their wholesome and humane talent at the service of the arc light and the lens. Aubrey felt a serene and intimate pleasure in watching them from a seat beside Titania. He knew that the breakfast table scene shadowed before them was only a makeshift section of lath propped up in some barnlike motion picture studio; yet his rocketing fancy imagined it as some arcadian suburb where he and Titania, by a jugglery of benign fate, were bungalowed together."}, {"size": 649, "text": "Young men have a pioneering imagination: it is doubtful whether any young Orlando ever found himself side by side with Rosalind without dreaming himself wedded to her. If men die a thousand deaths before this mortal coil is shuffled, even so surely do youths contract a thousand marriages before they go to the City Hall for a license. Aubrey remembered the opera glasses, which were still in his pocket, and brought them out. The trio amused themselves by watching Sidney Drew's face through the magnifying lenses.

Aubrey was hard pressed for a prompt and reasonable fib, but advertising men are resourceful. \"Oh,\" he said, \"I sometimes carry them with me at night to study the advertising sky-signs. I'm a little short sighted.

Perhaps I can drop in on Monday when Mr. Mifflin's away, and put coal on the furnace for you, or something of that sort?\" Mrs. Mifflin laughed. \"Surely!\" she said. \"You're welcome any time.\" The door closed behind them, and Aubrey fell into a profound melancholy. Deprived of the heavenly rhetoric of her eye, Gissing Street seemed flat and dull."}, {"size": 625, "text": "It was still early--not quite ten o'clock--and it occurred to Aubrey that if he was going to patrol the neighbourhood he had better fix its details in his head. Hazlitt, the next street below the bookshop, proved to be a quiet little byway, cheerfully lit with modest dwellings. A few paces down Hazlitt Street a narrow cobbled alley ran through to Wordsworth Avenue, passing between the back yards of Gissing Street and Whittier Street. The alley was totally dark, but by counting off the correct number of houses Aubrey identified the rear entrance of the bookshop. He tried the yard gate cautiously, and found it unlocked."}, {"size": 623, "text": "Glancing in he could see a light in the kitchen window and assumed that the cocoa was being brewed. Then a window glowed upstairs, and he was thrilled to see Titania shining in the lamplight. She moved to the window and pulled down the blind. For a moment he saw her head and shoulders silhouetted against the curtain; then the light went out. Aubrey stood briefly in sentimental thought. If he only had a couple of blankets, he mused, he could camp out here in Roger's back yard all night. Surely no harm could come to the girl while he kept watch beneath her casement! The idea was just fantastic enough to appeal to him."}, {"size": 611, "text": "Then, as he stood in the open gateway, he heard distant footfalls coming down the alley, and a grumble of voices. Perhaps two policemen on their rounds, he thought: it would be awkward to be surprised skulking about back doors at this time of night. He slipped inside the gate and closed it gently behind him, taking the precaution to slip the bolt. The footsteps came nearer, stumbling down the uneven cobbles in the darkness. He stood still against the back fence. To his amazement the men halted outside Mifflin's gate, and he heard the latch quietly lifted. \"It's no use,\" said a voice--\"the gate is locked."}, {"size": 766, "text": "We must find some other way, my friend.\" Aubrey tingled to hear the rolling, throaty \"r\" in the last word. There was no mistaking--this was the voice of his \"friend and well-wisher\" over the telephone. The other said something in German in a hoarse whisper. Having studied that language in college, Aubrey caught only two words--Thur and Schlussel, which he knew meant door and key. \"Very well,\" said the first voice. \"That will be all right, but we must act to-night. The damned thing must be finished to-morrow. Your idiotic stupidity--\" Again followed some gargling in German, in a rapid undertone too fluent for Aubrey's grasp. The latch of the alley gate clicked once more, and his hand was on his revolver; but in a moment the two had passed on down the alley."}, {"size": 616, "text": "The young advertising agent stood against the fence in silent horror, his heart bumping heavily. His hands were clammy, his feet seemed to have grown larger and taken root. What damnable complot was this? A sultry wave of anger passed over him. This bland, slick, talkative bookseller, was he arranging some blackmailing scheme to kidnap the girl and wring blood-money out of her father? And in league with Germans, too, the scoundrel! What an asinine thing for old Chapman to send an unprotected girl over here into the wilds of Brooklyn . . . and in the meantime, what was he to do? Patrol the back yard all night?"}, {"size": 640, "text": "No, the friend and well-wisher had said \"We must find some other way.\" Besides, Aubrey remembered something having been said about the old terrier sleeping in the kitchen. He felt sure Bock would not let any German in at night without raising the roof. Probably the best way would be to watch the front of the shop. In miserable perplexity he waited several minutes until the two Germans would be well out of earshot. Then he unbolted the gate and stole up the alley on tiptoe, in the opposite direction. It led into Wordsworth Avenue just behind Weintraub's drug store, over the rear of which hung the great girders and trestles of the \"L\""}, {"size": 690, "text": "station, a kind of Swiss chalet straddling the street on stilts. He thought it prudent to make a detour, so he turned east on Wordsworth Avenue until he reached Whittier Street, then sauntered easily down Whittier for a block, spying sharply for evidences of pursuit.

It was nearly eleven o'clock: the last audience was filing out of the movie theatre, where two workmen were already perched on ladders taking down the Tarzan electric light sign, to substitute the illuminated lettering for the next feature."}, {"size": 865, "text": "After some debate he decided that the best thing to do was to return to his room at Mrs. Schiller's, from which he could keep a sharp watch on the front door of the bookshop. By good fortune there was a lamp post almost directly in front of Mifflin's house, which cast plenty of light on the little sunken area before the door. With his opera glasses he could see from his bedroom whatever went on. As he crossed the street he cast his eyes upward at the facade of Mrs. Schiller's house. Two windows in the fourth storey were lit, and the gas burned minutely in the downstairs hall, elsewhere all was dark. And then, as he glanced at the window of his own chamber, where the curtain was still tucked back behind the pane, he noticed a curious thing. A small point of rosy light glowed, faded, and glowed again by the window. Someone was smoking a cigar in his room."}, {"size": 602, "text": "Aubrey continued walking in even stride, as though he had seen nothing. Returning down the street, on the opposite side, he verified his first glance. The light was still there, and he judged himself not far out in assuming the smoker to be the friend and well-wisher or one of his gang. He had suspected the other man in the alley of being Weintraub, but he could not be sure. A cautious glance through the window of the drug store revealed Weintraub at his prescription counter. Aubrey determined to get even with the guttural gentleman who was waiting for him, certainly with no affectionate intent."}, {"size": 601, "text": "He thanked the good fortune that had led him to stick the book cover in his overcoat pocket when leaving Mrs. Schiller's. Evidently, for reasons unknown, someone was very anxious to get hold of it. An idea occurred to him as he passed the little florist's shop, which was just closing. He entered and bought a dozen white carnations, and then, as if by an afterthought, asked \"Have you any wire?\" The florist produced a spool of the slender, tough wire that is sometimes used to nip the buds of expensive roses, to prevent them from blossoming too quickly. \"Let me have about eight feet,\" said Aubrey."}, {"size": 643, "text": "\"I need some to-night and I guess the hardware stores are all closed.\" With this he returned to Mrs. Schiller's, picking his way carefully and close to the houses so as to be out of sight from the upstairs windows. He climbed the steps and unlatched the door with bated breath. It was half-past eleven, and he wondered how long he would have to wait for the well-wisher to descend. He could not help chuckling as he made his preparations, remembering an occasion at college somewhat similar in setting though far less serious in purpose. First he took off his shoes, laying them carefully to one side where he could find them again in a hurry."}, {"size": 657, "text": "Then, choosing a banister about six feet from the bottom of the stairs he attached one end of the wire tightly to its base and spread the slack in a large loop over two of the stair treads. The remaining end of the wire he passed out through the banisters, twisting it into a small loop so that he could pull it easily. Then he turned out the hall gas and sat down in the dark to wait events. He sat for a long time, in some nervousness lest the pug dog might come prowling and find him. He was startled by a lady in a dressing gown--perhaps Mrs. J. F. Smith--who emerged from a ground-floor room passed very close to him in the dark, and muttered upstairs."}, {"size": 700, "text": "He twitched his noose out of the way just in time. Presently, however, his patience was rewarded. He heard a door squeak above, and then the groaning of the staircase as someone descended slowly. He relaid his trap and waited, smiling to himself. A clock somewhere in the house was chiming twelve as the man came groping down the last flight, feeling his way in the dark. Aubrey heard him swearing under his breath. At the precise moment, when both his victim's feet were within the loop, Aubrey gave the wire a gigantic tug. The man fell like a safe, crashing against the banisters and landing in a sprawl on the floor. It was a terrific fall, and shook the house. He lay there groaning and cursing."}, {"size": 658, "text": "Barely retaining his laughter, Aubrey struck a match and held it over the sprawling figure. The man lay with his face twisted against one out-spread arm, but the beard was unmistakable. It was the assistant chef again, and he seemed partly unconscious. \"Burnt hair is a grand restorative,\" said Aubrey to himself, and applied the match to the bush of beard. He singed off a couple of inches of it with intense delight, and laid his carnations on the head of the stricken one. Then, hearing stirrings in the basement, he gathered up his wire and shoes and fled upstairs. He gained his room roaring with inward mirth, but entered cautiously, fearing some trap."}, {"size": 697, "text": "Save for a strong tincture of cigar smoke, everything seemed correct. Listening at his door he heard Mrs. Schiller exclaiming shrilly in the hall, assisted by yappings from the pug. Doors upstairs were opened, and questions were called out. He heard guttural groans from the bearded one, mingled with oaths and some angry remark about having fallen downstairs. The pug, frenzied with excitement, yelled insanely. A female voice--possibly Mrs. J. F. Smith--cried out \"What's that smell of burning?\" Someone else said, \"They're burning feathers under his nose to bring him to.\" \"Yes, Hun's feathers,\" chuckled Aubrey to himself. He locked his door, and sat down by the window with his opera glasses."}, {"size": 707, "text": "Again the Narrative is RetardedRoger had spent a quiet evening in the bookshop. Sitting at his desk under a fog of tobacco, he had honestly intended to do some writing on the twelfth chapter of his great work on bookselling.

Then he could see the ensuing reception: the distinguished savants crowding round; the plates of macaroons, the cups of untasted tea; the ladies twittering, \"Now there's something I want to ask you--why are there so many statues to generals, admirals, parsons, doctors, statesmen, scientists, artists, and authors, but no statues to booksellers?\""}, {"size": 746, "text": "Contemplation of this glittering scene always lured Roger into fantastic dreams. Ever since he had travelled country roads, some years before, selling books from a van drawn by a fat white horse, he had nourished a secret hope of some day founding a Parnassus on Wheels Corporation which would own a fleet of these vans and send them out into the rural byways where bookstores are unknown. He loved to imagine a great map of New York State, with the daily location of each travelling Parnassus marked by a coloured pin. He dreamed of himself, sitting in some vast central warehouse of second-hand books, poring over his map like a military chief of staff and forwarding cases of literary ammunition to various bases where his vans would re-stock."}, {"size": 675, "text": "His idea was that his travelling salesmen could be recruited largely from college professors, parsons, and newspaper men, who were weary of their thankless tasks, and would welcome an opportunity to get out on the road.

Even when awake it is a victim of its own ill-adjustment, of disease, of age, of external suggestion, of nature's compulsions; it doubts its own sensations and trusts only in instruments and averages."}, {"size": 620, "text": "After sixty years or so of growing astonishment the mind wakes to find itself looking blankly into the void of death. And, as Adams says, that it should profess itself pleased by this performance is all that the highest rules of good breeding can ask. That the mind should actually be satisfied would prove that it exists only as idiocy! I hope that you will write to tell me along what curves your mind is moving. For my own part I feel that we are on the verge of amazing things. Long ago I fell back on books as the only permanent consolers. They are the one stainless and unimpeachable achievement of the human race."}, {"size": 732, "text": "It saddens me to think that I shall have to die with thousands of books unread that would have given me noble and unblemished happiness. I will tell you a secret. I have never read King Lear, and have purposely refrained from doing so. If I were ever very ill I would only need to say to myself \"You can't die yet, you haven't read Lear.\" That would bring me round, I know it would. You see, books are the answer to all our perplexities! Henry Adams grinds his teeth at his inability to understand the universe. The best he can do is to suggest a \"law of acceleration,\" which seems to mean that Nature is hustling man along at an ever-increasing rate so that he will either solve all her problems or else die of fever in the effort."}, {"size": 747, "text": "But Adams' candid portrait of a mind grappling helplessly with its riddles is so triumphantly delightful that one forgets the futility of the struggle in the accuracy of the picture. Man is unconquerable because he can make even his helplessness so entertaining. His motto seems to be \"Even though He slay me, yet will I make fun of Him!\" Yes, books are man's supreme triumph, for they gather up and transmit all other triumphs. As Walter de la Mare writes, \"How uncomprehendingly must an angel from heaven smile on a poor human sitting engrossed in a romance: angled upon his hams, motionless in his chair, spectacles on nose, his two feet as close together as the flukes of a merman's tail, only his strange eyes stirring in his time-worn face.\""}, {"size": 646, "text": "Well, I've been scribbling away all this time and haven't given you any news whatever.

He took down The Anatomy of Melancholy, that most delightful of all books for midnight browsing.

After the first sleep 'tis not amiss to lie on the left side, that the meat may the better descend, and sometimes again on the belly, but never on the back. Seven or eight hours is a competent time for a melancholy man to rest---- In that case, thought Roger, it's time for me to be turning in. He looked at his watch, and found it was half-past twelve. He switched off his light and went back to the kitchen quarters to tend the furnace."}, {"size": 759, "text": "I hesitate to touch upon a topic of domestic bitterness, but candor compels me to say that Roger's evening vigils invariably ended at the ice-box. There are two theories as to this subject of ice-box plundering, one of the husband and the other of the wife. Husbands are prone to think (in their simplicity) that if they take a little of everything palatable they find in the refrigerator, but thus distributing their forage over the viands the general effect of the depradation will be almost unnoticeable. Whereas wives say (and Mrs. Mifflin had often explained to Roger) that it is far better to take all of any one dish than a little of each; for the latter course is likely to diminish each item below the bulk at which it is still useful as a left-over."}, {"size": 701, "text": "Roger, however, had the obstinate viciousness of all good husbands, and he knew the delights of cold provender by heart. Many a stewed prune, many a mess of string beans or naked cold boiled potato, many a chicken leg, half apple pie, or sector of rice pudding, had perished in these midnight festivals. He made it a point of honour never to eat quite all of the dish in question, but would pass with unabated zest from one to another. This habit he had sternly repressed during the War, but Mrs. Mifflin had noticed that since the armistice he had resumed it with hearty violence. This is a custom which causes the housewife to be confronted the next morning with a tragical vista of pathetic scraps."}, {"size": 684, "text": "Two slices of beet in a little earthenware cup, a sliver of apple pie one inch wide, three prunes lowly nestling in a mere trickle of their own syrup, and a tablespoonful of stewed rhubarb where had been one of those yellow basins nearly full--what can the most resourceful kitcheneer do with these oddments? This atrocious practice cannot be too bitterly condemned. But we are what we are, and Roger was even more so. The Anatomy of Melancholy always made him hungry, and he dipped discreetly into various vessels of refreshment, sharing a few scraps with Bock whose pleading brown eye at these secret suppers always showed a comical realization of their shameful and furtive nature."}, {"size": 725, "text": "Bock knew very well that Roger had no business at the ice-box, for the larger outlines of social law upon which every home depends are clearly understood by dogs.

The censure of a dog is something no man can stand. But I rove, as Burton would say. After the ice-box, the cellar. Like all true householders, Roger was fond of his cellar. It was something mouldy of smell, but it harboured a well-stocked little bin of liquors, and the florid glow of the furnace mouth upon the concrete floor was a great pleasure to the bookseller."}, {"size": 672, "text": "He loved to peer in at the dancing flicker of small blue flames that played above the ruddy mound of coals in the firebox--tenuous, airy little flames that were as blue as violets and hovered up and down in the ascending gases.

Gissing Street was bright and demure in the crisp quietness of the forenoon. Mifflin's house showed no sign of life.

Aubrey was a little dashed, but he said cheerily \"Hullo, Bock! Good old man! Well, well, nice old fellow!\" To his surprise, Bock recognized him as a friend and wagged his tail slightly, but still continued to growl. \"I wish dogs weren't such sticklers for form,\" thought Aubrey. \"Now if I went in by the front door, Bock wouldn't say anything."}, {"size": 625, "text": "It's just because he sees me coming in this way that he's annoyed.

It will never be known how severely Bock was tempted by the extremities thus exposed to him, but he was an old dog and his martial instincts had been undermined by years of kindness. Moreover, he remembered Aubrey perfectly well, and the smell of his trousers did not seem at all hostile. So he contented himself with a small grumbling of protest. He was an Irish terrier, but there was nothing Sinn Fein about him."}, {"size": 878, "text": "Aubrey dropped to the floor, and patted the dog, thanking his good fortune.

After all, he had acted in pure good faith. \"With pleasure,\" he said, \"but not until I have told you something. It's very important. I beg your pardon most awfully for frightening you, but it's really very urgent.\" There was a brief silence. Then she said: \"Brooklyn's a queer place.

You're as bad as Morris Finsbury in The Wrong Box. That's what I was reading when I heard the dog barking.\" Aubrey began to grow nettled. \"You seem to think this was a mere impertinence on my part,\" he said. \"Let me tell you a thing or two.\" And he briefly described to her the course of his experiences since leaving the shop on Friday evening, but omitting the fact that he was lodging just across the street."}, {"size": 601, "text": "\"There's something mighty unpalatable going on,\" he said. \"At first I thought Mifflin was the goat.

I don't know what they're pulling off, but I don't like the looks of it. You say Mifflin has gone out to see your father? I bet that's just camouflage, to stall you. I've got a great mind to ring Mr. Chapman up and tell him he ought to get you out of here.\" \"I won't hear a word said against Mr. Mifflin,\""}, {"size": 727, "text": "said Titania angrily. \"He's one of my father's oldest friends. What would Mr. Mifflin say if he knew you had been breaking into his house and frightening me half to death? I'm sorry you got that knock on the head, because it seems that's your weak spot. I'm quite able to take care of myself, thank you. This isn't a movie.\" \"Well, how do you explain the actions of this man Weintraub?\" said Aubrey. \"Do you like to have a man popping in and out of the shop at all hours of the night, stealing books?\" \"I don't have to explain it at all,\" said Titania. \"I think it's up to you to do the explaining. Weintraub is a harmless old thing and he keeps delicious chocolates that cost only half as much as what you get on Fifth Avenue."}, {"size": 638, "text": "Mr. Mifflin told me that he's a very good customer. Perhaps his business won't let him read in the daytime, and he comes in here late at night to borrow books. He probably reads in bed.\" \"I don't think anybody who talks German round back alleys at night is a harmless old thing,\" said Aubrey. \"I tell you, your Haunted Bookshop is haunted by something worse than the ghost of Thomas Carlyle. Let me show you something.\" He pulled the book cover out of his pocket, and pointed to the annotations in it. \"That's Mifflin's handwriting,\" said Titania, pointing to the upper row of figures. \"He puts notes like that in all his favourite books."}, {"size": 625, "text": "They refer to pages where he has found interesting things.\" \"Yes, and that's Weintraub's,\" said Aubrey, indicating the numbers in violet ink. \"If that isn't a proof of their complicity, I'd like to know what is. If that Cromwell book is here, I'd like to have a look at it.\" They went into the shop. Titania preceded him down the musty aisle, and it made Aubrey angry to see the obstinate assurance of her small shoulders. He was horribly tempted to seize her and shake her. It annoyed him to see her bright, unconscious girlhood in that dingy vault of books. \"She's as out of place here as--as a Packard ad in the Liberator\""}, {"size": 605, "text": "he said to himself. They stood in the History alcove. \"Here it is,\" she said. \"No, it isn't--that's the History of Frederick the Great.\" There was a two-inch gap in the shelf. Cromwell was gone. \"Probably Mr. Mifflin has it somewhere around,\" said Titania. \"It was there last night.\" \"Probably nothing,\" said Aubrey. \"I tell you, Weintraub came in and took it. I saw him. Look here, if you really want to know what I think, I'll tell you. The War's not over by a long sight. Weintraub's a German. Carlyle was pro-German--I remember that much from college. I believe your friend Mifflin is pro-German, too."}, {"size": 617, "text": "I've heard some of his talk!\" Titania faced him with cheeks aflame. \"That'll do for you!\" she cried. \"Next thing I suppose you'll say Daddy's pro-German, and me, too! I'd like to see you say that to Mr. Mifflin himself.\" \"I will, don't worry,\" said Aubrey grimly. He knew now that he had put himself hopelessly in the wrong in Titania's mind, but he refused to abate his own convictions. With sinking heart he saw her face relieved against the shelves of faded bindings. Her eyes shone with a deep and sultry blue, her chin quivered with anger. \"Look here,\" she said furiously. \"Either you or I must leave this place."}, {"size": 641, "text": "If you intend to stay, please call me a taxi.\" Aubrey was as angry as she was. \"I'm going,\" he said. \"But you've got to play fair with me. I tell you on my oath, these two men, Mifflin and Weintraub, are framing something up. I'm going to get the goods on them and show you. But you mustn't put them wise that I'm on their track. If you do, of course, they'll call it off. I don't care what you think of me. You've got to promise me that.\" \"I won't promise you ANYTHING,\" she said, \"except never to speak to you again. I never saw a man like you before--and I've seen a good many.\" \"I won't leave here until you promise me not to warn them,\""}, {"size": 602, "text": "he retorted. \"What I told you, I said in confidence.

Then her face altered. The defiant little line of her mouth bent and her strength seemed to run out at each end of that pathetic curve. \"Yes, I will,\" she said. \"I suppose that's fair. I couldn't tell Mr."}, {"size": 774, "text": "Mifflin, anyway. I'd be ashamed to tell him how you frightened me. I think you're hateful. I came over here thinking I was going to have such a good time, and you've spoilt it all!\" For one terrible moment he thought she was going to cry. But he remembered having seen heroines cry in the movies, and knew it was only done when there was a table and chair handy. \"Miss Chapman,\" he said, \"I'm as sorry as a man can be. But I swear I did what I did in all honesty. If I'm wrong in this, you need never speak to me again. If I'm wrong, you--you can tell your father to take his advertising away from the Grey-Matter Company. I can't say more than that.\" And, to do him justice, he couldn't. It was the supreme sacrifice.

His only consolation was that twenty minutes after he had left the bookshop he saw a taxi drive up (he was then sitting gloomily at his bedroom window) and Titania enter it and drive away. He supposed that she had gone to join the party in Larchmont, and was glad to know that she was out of what he now called the war zone. For the first time on record, O. Henry failed to solace him. His pipe tasted bitter and brackish. He was eager to know what Weintraub was doing, but did not dare make any investigations in broad daylight."}, {"size": 686, "text": "His idea was to wait until dark. Observing the Sabbath calm of the streets, and the pageant of baby carriages wheeling toward Thackeray Boulevard, he wondered again whether he had thrown away this girl's friendship for a merely imaginary suspicion.

Mounting to the second floor he tapped on the bathroom door. \"Don't come in!\" cried an agitated female voice. He thrust the memorandum under the door, and left the house. Walking the windy paths of Prospect Park he condemned himself to relentless self-scrutiny. \"I've damned myself forever with her,\" he groaned, \"unless I can prove something.\" The vision of Titania's face silhouetted against the shelves of books came maddeningly to his mind."}, {"size": 471, "text": "\"I was going to have such a good time, and you've spoilt it all!\" With what angry conviction she had said: \"I never saw a man like you before--and I've seen a good many!\" Even in his disturbance of soul the familiar jargon of his profession came naturally to utterance. \"At least she admits I'm DIFFERENT,\" he said dolefully.

When he got back to Gissing Street it was dark, and he girded his soul for further endeavour. About nine o'clock he walked up the alley. He had left his overcoat in his room at Mrs. Schiller's and also the Cromwell bookcover--having taken the precaution, however, to copy the inscriptions into his pocket memorandum-book. He noticed lights in the rear of the bookshop, and concluded that the Mifflins and their employee had got home safely. Arrived at the back of Weintraub's pharmacy, he studied the contours of the building carefully."}, {"size": 672, "text": "The drug store lay, as we have explained before, at the corner of Gissing Street and Wordsworth Avenue, just where the Elevated railway swings in a long curve. The course of this curve brought the scaffolding of the viaduct out over the back roof of the building, and this fact had impressed itself on Aubrey's observant eye the day before. The front of the drug store stood three storeys, but in the rear it dropped to two, with a flat roof over the hinder portion. Two windows looked out upon this roof. Weintraub's back yard opened onto the alley, but the gate, he found, was locked. The fence would not be hard to scale, but he hesitated to make so direct an approach."}, {"size": 640, "text": "He ascended the stairs of the \"L\" station, on the near side, and paying a nickel passed through a turnstile onto the platform. Waiting until just after a train had left, and the long, windy sweep of planking was solitary, he dropped onto the narrow footway that runs beside the track. This required watchful walking, for the charged third rail was very near, but hugging the outer side of the path he proceeded without trouble. Every fifteen feet or so a girder ran sideways from the track, resting upon an upright from the street below. The fourth of these overhung the back corner of Weintraub's house, and he crawled cautiously along it."}, {"size": 620, "text": "People were passing on the pavement underneath, and he greatly feared being discovered. But he reached the end of the beam without mishap. From here a drop of about twelve feet would bring him onto Weintraub's back roof. For a moment he reflected that, once down there, it would be impossible to return the same way. However, he decided to risk it. Where he was, with his legs swinging astride the girder, he was in serious danger of attracting attention. He would have given a great deal, just then, to have his overcoat with him, for by lowering it first he could have jumped onto it and muffled the noise of his fall."}, {"size": 708, "text": "He took off his coat and carefully dropped it on the corner of the roof. Then cannily waiting until a train passed overhead, drowning all other sounds with its roar, he lowered himself as far as he could hang by his hands, and let go. For some minutes he lay prone on the tin roof, and during that time a number of distressing ideas occurred to him. If he really expected to get into Weintraub's house, why had he not laid his plans more carefully? Why (for instance) had he not made some attempt to find out how many there were in the household? Why had he not arranged with one of his friends to call Weintraub to the telephone at a given moment, so that he could be more sure of making an entry unnoticed?"}, {"size": 708, "text": "And what did he expect to see or do if he got inside the house? He found no answer to any of these questions. It was unpleasantly cold, and he was glad to slip his coat on again. The small revolver was still in his hip pocket. Another thought occurred to him--that he should have provided himself with tennis shoes. However, it was some comfort to know that rubber heels of a nationally advertised brand were under him. He crawled quietly up to the sill of one of the windows. It was closed, and the room inside was dark. A blind was pulled most of the way down, leaving a gap of about four inches. Peeping cautiously over the sill, he could see farther inside the house a brightly lit door and a passageway."}, {"size": 637, "text": "\"One thing I've got to look out for,\" he thought, \"is children. There are bound to be some--who ever heard of a German without offspring? If I wake them, they'll bawl. This room is very likely a nursery, as it's on the southeastern side. Also, the window is shut tight, which is probably the German idea of bedroom ventilation.\" His guess may not have been a bad one, for after his eyes became accustomed to the dimness of the room he thought he could perceive two cot beds. He then crawled over to the other window. Here the blind was pulled down flush with the bottom of the sash. Trying the window very cautiously, he found it locked."}, {"size": 758, "text": "Not knowing just what to do, he returned to the first window, and lay there peering in. The sill was just high enough above the roof level to make it necessary to raise himself a little on his hands to see inside, and the position was very trying. Moreover, the tin roof had a tendency to crumple noisily when he moved. He lay for some time, shivering in the chill, and wondering whether it would be safe to light a pipe. \"There's another thing I'd better look out for,\" he thought, \"and that's a dog. Who ever heard of a German without a dachshund?\" He had watched the lighted doorway for a long while without seeing anything, and was beginning to think he was losing time to no profit when a stout and not ill-natured looking woman appeared in the hallway."}, {"size": 769, "text": "She came into the room he was studying, and closed the door. She switched on the light, and to his horror began to disrobe. This was not what he had counted on at all, and he retreated rapidly. It was plain that nothing was to be gained where he was. He sat timidly at one edge of the roof and wondered what to do next. As he sat there, the back door opened almost directly below him, and he heard the clang of a garbage can set out by the stoop. The door stood open for perhaps half a minute, and he heard a male voice--Weintraub's, he thought--speaking in German. For the first time in his life he yearned for the society of his German instructor at college, and also wondered--in the rapid irrelevance of thought--what that worthy man was now doing to earn a living."}, {"size": 878, "text": "In a rather long and poorly lubricated sentence, heavily verbed at the end, he distinguished one phrase that seemed important. \"Nach Philadelphia gehen\"--\"Go to Philadelphia.\" Did that refer to Mifflin? he wondered. The door closed again. Leaning over the rain-gutter, he saw the light go out in the kitchen. He tried to look through the upper portion of the window just below him, but leaning out too far, the tin spout gave beneath his hands. Without knowing just how he did it, he slithered down the side of the wall, and found his feet on a window-sill. His hands still clung to the tin gutter above. He made haste to climb down from his position, and found himself outside the back door. He had managed the descent rather more quietly than if it had been carefully planned. But he was badly startled, and retreated to the bottom of the yard to see if he had aroused notice."}, {"size": 623, "text": "A wait of several minutes brought no alarm, and he plucked up courage. On the inner side of the house--away from Wordsworth Avenue--a narrow paved passage led to an outside cellar-way with old-fashioned slanting doors. He reconnoitred this warily. A bright light was shining from a window in this alley. He crept below it on hands and knees fearing to look in until he had investigated a little. He found that one flap of the cellar door was open, and poked his nose into the aperture. All was dark below, but a strong, damp stench of paints and chemicals arose. He sniffed gingerly. \"I suppose he stores drugs down there,\""}, {"size": 601, "text": "he thought. Very carefully he crawled back, on hands and knees, toward the lighted window. Lifting his head a few inches at a time, finally he got his eyes above the level of the sill. To his disappointment he found the lower half of the window frosted. As he knelt there, a pipe set in the wall suddenly vomited liquid which gushed out upon his knees. He sniffed it, and again smelled a strong aroma of acids. With great care, leaning against the brick wall of the house, he rose to his feet and peeped through the upper half of the pane. It seemed to be the room where prescriptions were compounded."}, {"size": 677, "text": "As it was empty, he allowed himself a hasty survey. All manner of bottles were ranged along the walls; there was a high counter with scales, a desk, and a sink. At the back he could see the bamboo curtain which he remembered having noticed from the shop. The whole place was in the utmost disorder: mortars, glass beakers, a typewriter, cabinets of labels, dusty piles of old prescriptions strung on filing hooks, papers of pills and capsules, all strewn in an indescribable litter. Some infusion was heating in a glass bowl propped on a tripod over a blue gas flame. Aubrey noticed particularly a heap of old books several feet high piled carelessly at one end of the counter."}, {"size": 600, "text": "Looking more carefully, he saw that what he had taken for a mirror over the prescription counter was an aperture looking into the shop. Through this he could see Weintraub, behind the cigar case, waiting upon some belated customer with his shop-worn air of affability. The visitor departed, and Weintraub locked the door after him and pulled down the blinds. Then he returned toward the prescription room, and Aubrey ducked out of view. Presently he risked looking again, and was just in time to see a curious sight. The druggist was bending over the counter, pouring some liquid into a glass vessel."}, {"size": 724, "text": "His face was directly under a hanging bulb, and Aubrey was amazed at the transformation. The apparently genial apothecary of cigar stand and soda fountain was gone. He saw instead a heavy, cruel, jowlish face, with eyelids hooded down over the eyes, and a square thrusting chin buttressed on a mass of jaw and suetty cheek that glistened with an oily shimmer. The jaw quivered a little as though with some intense suppressed emotion. The man was completely absorbed in his task. The thick lower lip lapped upward over the mouth. On the cheekbone was a deep red scar. Aubrey felt a pang of fascinated amazement at the gross energy and power of that abominable relentless mask. \"So this is the harmless old thing!\" he thought."}, {"size": 676, "text": "Just then the bamboo curtain parted, and the woman whom he had seen upstairs appeared. Forgetting his own situation, Aubrey still stared. She wore a faded dressing gown and her hair was braided as though for the night. She looked frightened, and must have spoken, for Aubrey saw her lips move. The man remained bent over his counter until the last drops of liquid had run out. His jaw tightened, he straightened suddenly and took one step toward her, with outstretched hand imperiously pointed. Aubrey could see his face plainly: it had a savagery more than bestial. The woman's face, which had borne a timid, pleading expression, appealed in vain against that fierce gesture."}, {"size": 881, "text": "She turned and vanished. Aubrey saw the druggist's pointing finger tremble. Again he ducked out of sight. \"That man's face would be lonely in a crowd,\" he said to himself. \"And I used to think the movies exaggerated things. Say, he ought to play opposite Theda Bara.\" He lay at full length in the paved alley and thought that a little acquaintance with Weintraub would go a long way. Then the light in the window above him went out, and he gathered himself together for quick motion if necessary. Perhaps the man would come out to close the cellar door---- The thought was in his mind when a light flashed on farther down the passage, between him and the kitchen. It came from a small barred window on the ground level. Evidently the druggist had gone down into the cellar. Aubrey crawled silently along toward the yard. Reaching the lit pane he lay against the wall and looked in."}, {"size": 728, "text": "The window was too grimed for him to see clearly, but what he could make out had the appearance of a chemical laboratory and machine shop combined. A long work bench was lit by several electrics. On it he saw glass vials of odd shapes, and a medley of tools. Sheets of tin, lengths of lead pipe, gas burners, a vise, boilers and cylinders, tall jars of coloured fluids. He could hear a dull humming sound, which he surmised came from some sort of revolving tool which he could see was run by a belt from a motor. On trying to spy more clearly he found that what he had taken for dirt was a coat of whitewash which had been applied to the window on the inside, but the coating had worn away in one spot which gave him a loophole."}, {"size": 621, "text": "What surprised him most was to spy the covers of a number of books strewn about the work table. One, he was ready to swear, was the Cromwell. He knew that bright blue cloth by this time. For the second time that evening Aubrey wished for the presence of one of his former instructors. \"I wish I had my old chemistry professor here,\" he thought. \"I'd like to know what this bird is up to. I'd hate to swallow one of his prescriptions.\" His teeth were chattering after the long exposure and he was wet through from lying in the little gutter that apparently drained off from the sink in Weintraub's prescription laboratory."}, {"size": 746, "text": "He could not see what the druggist was doing in the cellar, for the man's broad back was turned toward him. He felt as though he had had quite enough thrills for one evening. Creeping along he found his way back to the yard, and stepped cautiously among the empty boxes with which it was strewn. An elevated train rumbled overhead, and he watched the brightly lighted cars swing by. While the train roared above him, he scrambled up the fence and dropped down into the alley. \"Well,\" he thought, \"I'd give full-page space, preferred position, in the magazine Ben Franklin founded to the guy that'd tell me what's going on at this grand bolshevik headquarters.

Say, old Grey Matter gives service that's DIFFERENT, don't she!

As a minor poet has said, he \"made sleep a career.\"But he did not know what train Roger might be taking, and he was determined not to miss him. By a quarter after six he was seated in the Milwaukee Lunch (which is never closed--Open from Now Till the Judgment Day."}, {"size": 603, "text": "Tables for Ladies, as its sign says) with a cup of coffee and corned beef hash. In the mood of tender melancholy common to unaccustomed early rising he dwelt fondly on the thought of Titania, so near and yet so far away. He had leisure to give free rein to these musings, for it was ten past seven before Roger appeared, hurrying toward the subway. Aubrey followed at a discreet distance, taking care not to be observed. The bookseller and his pursuer both boarded the eight o'clock train at the Pennsylvania Station, but in very different moods. To Roger, this expedition was a frolic, pure and simple."}, {"size": 659, "text": "He had been tied down to the bookshop so long that a day's excursion seemed too good to be true. He bought two cigars--an unusual luxury--and let the morning paper lie unheeded in his lap as the train drummed over the Hackensack marshes. He felt a good deal of pride in having been summoned to appraise the Oldham library. Mr. Oldham was a very distinguished collector, a wealthy Philadelphia merchant whose choice Johnson, Lamb, Keats, and Blake items were the envy of connoisseurs all over the world. Roger knew very well that there were many better-known dealers who would have jumped at the chance to examine the collection and pocket the appraiser's fee."}, {"size": 872, "text": "The word that Roger had had by long distance telephone was that Mr. Oldham had decided to sell his collection, and before putting it to auction desired the advices of an expert as to the prices his items should command in the present state of the market. And as Roger was not particularly conversant with current events in the world of rare books and manuscripts, he spent most of the trip in turning over some annotated catalogues of recent sales which Mr. Chapman had lent him. \"This invitation,\" he said to himself, \"confirms what I have always said, that the artist, in any line of work, will eventually be recognized above the mere tradesman. Somehow or other Mr. Oldham has heard that I am not only a seller of old books but a lover of them. He prefers to have me go over his treasures with him, rather than one of those who peddle these things like so much tallow.\""}, {"size": 672, "text": "Aubrey's humour was far removed from that of the happy bookseller. In the first place, Roger was sitting in the smoker, and as Aubrey feared to enter the same car for fear of being observed, he had to do without his pipe. He took the foremost seat in the second coach, and peering occasionally through the glass doors he could see the bald poll of his quarry wreathed with exhalements of cheap havana. Secondly, he had hoped to see Weintraub on the same train, but though he had tarried at the train-gate until the last moment, the German had not appeared. He had concluded from Weintraub's words the night before that druggist and bookseller were bound on a joint errand."}, {"size": 611, "text": "Apparently he was mistaken. He bit his nails, glowered at the flying landscape, and revolved many grievous fancies in his prickling bosom.

He was quite surprised at the impressive vista of South Broad Street, and chagrined to find people jostling him on the crowded pavement as though they did not know he had just come from New York. Roger turned in at a huge office building on Broad Street and took an express elevator. Aubrey did not dare follow him into the car, so he waited in the lobby. He learned from the starter that there was a second tier of elevators on the other side of the building, so he tipped a boy a quarter to watch them for him, describing Mifflin so accurately that he could not be missed."}, {"size": 708, "text": "By this time Aubrey was in a thoroughly ill temper, and enjoyed quarrelling with the starter on the subject of indicators for showing the position of the elevators. Observing that in this building the indicators were glass tubes in which the movement of the car was traced by a rising or falling column of coloured fluid, Aubrey remarked testily that that old-fashioned stunt had long been abandoned in New York.

Mr. Oldham, a tall, thin man with short gray hair and lively black eyes, rose courteously from his desk. \"How do you do, sir,\" he said. \"I'm sorry, I had forgotten our appointment.\" \"He must be very absent minded,\" thought Roger. \"Arranges to sell a collection worth half a million, and forgets all about it.\""}, {"size": 448, "text": "\"I came over in response to your message,\" he said. \"About selling your collection.\" Mr. Oldham looked at him, rather intently, Roger thought. \"Do you want to buy it?\" he said. \"To buy it?\" said Roger, a little peevishly. \"Why, no. I came over to appraise it for you. Your secretary telephoned me on Saturday.\" \"My dear sir,\" replied the other, \"there must be some mistake. I have no intention of selling my collection. I never sent you a message.\""}, {"size": 716, "text": "\"Why,\" he exclaimed, \"your secretary called me up on Saturday and said you particularly wanted me to come over this morning, to examine your books with you. I've made the trip from Brooklyn for that purpose.\" Mr. Oldham touched a buzzer, and a middle-aged woman came into the office. \"Miss Patterson,\" he said, \"did you telephone to Mr. Mifflin of Brooklyn on Saturday, asking him----\" \"It was a man that telephoned,\" said Roger. \"I'm exceedingly sorry, Mr. Mifflin,\" said Mr. Oldham. \"More sorry than I can tell you--I'm afraid someone has played a trick on you. As I told you, and Miss Patterson will bear me out, I have no idea of selling my books, and have never authorized any one even to suggest such a thing.\""}, {"size": 609, "text": "Roger was filled with confusion and anger. A hoax on the part of some of the Corn Cob Club, he thought to himself. He flushed painfully to recall the simplicity of his glee. \"Please don't be embarrassed,\" said Mr. Oldham, seeing the little man's vexation. \"Don't let's consider the trip wasted. Won't you come out and dine with me in the country this evening, and see my things?\" But Roger was too proud to accept this balm, courteous as it was. \"I'm sorry,\" he said, \"but I'm afraid I can't do it. I'm rather busy at home, and only came over because I believed this to be urgent.\" \"Some other time, perhaps,\""}, {"size": 614, "text": "said Mr. Oldham. \"Look here, you're a bookseller? I don't believe I know your shop. Give me your card. The next time I'm in New York I'd like to stop in.\" Roger got away as quickly as the other's politeness would let him. He chafed savagely at the awkwardness of his position. Not until he reached the street again did he breathe freely. \"Some of Jerry Gladfist's tomfoolery, I'll bet a hat,\" he muttered. \"By the bones of Fanny Kelly, I'll make him smart for it.\" Even Aubrey, picking up the trail again, could see that Roger was angry. \"Something's got his goat,\" he reflected. \"I wonder what he's peeved about?\""}, {"size": 663, "text": "They crossed Broad Street and Roger started off down Chestnut. Aubrey saw the bookseller halt in a doorway to light his pipe, and stopped some yards behind him to look up at the statue of William Penn on the City Hall. It was a blustery day, and at that moment a gust of wind whipped off his hat and sent it spinning down Broad Street. He ran half a block before he recaptured it. When he got back to Chestnut, Roger had disappeared. He hurried down Chestnut Street, bumping pedestrians in his eagerness, but at Thirteenth he halted in dismay. Nowhere could he see a sign of the little bookseller.

At the end of this time he found himself in front of a newspaper office, and remembered that an old friend of his was an editorial writer on the staff. He entered, and went up in the elevator. He found his friend in a small grimy den, surrounded by a sea of papers, smoking a pipe with his feet on the table."}, {"size": 773, "text": "They greeted each other joyfully. \"Well, look who's here!\" cried the facetious journalist. \"Tamburlaine the Great, and none other!

Nay, say not so!\" They lunched together at a quiet Italian restaurant, and Aubrey narrated tersely the adventures of the past few days. The newspaper man smoked pensively when the story was concluded. \"I'd like to see the girl,\" he said. \"Tambo, your tale hath the ring of sincerity. It is full of sound and fury, but it signifieth something. You say your man is a second-hand bookseller?\""}, {"size": 623, "text": "\"Then I know where you'll find him.\" \"It's worth trying.

Just mention my name to her, will you? \"Right up the block,\" he pointed as they reached Chestnut Street. \"No, I won't come with you, Wilson's speaking to Congress to-day, and there's big stuff coming over the wire. So long, old man. Invite me to the wedding!\"Aubrey had no idea what Leary's was, and rather expected it to be a tavern of some sort."}, {"size": 605, "text": "When he reached the place, however, he saw why his friend had suggested it as a likely lurking ground for Roger. It would be as impossible for any bibliophile to pass this famous second-hand bookstore as for a woman to go by a wedding party without trying to see the bride. Although it was a bleak day, and a snell wind blew down the street, the pavement counters were lined with people turning over disordered piles of volumes. Within, he could see a vista of white shelves, and the many-coloured tapestry of bindings stretching far away to the rear of the building. He entered eagerly, and looked about."}, {"size": 644, "text": "The shop was comfortably busy, with a number of people browsing. They seemed normal enough from behind, but in their eyes he detected the wild, peering glitter of the bibliomaniac. Here and there stood members of the staff. Upon their features Aubrey discerned the placid and philosophic tranquillity which he associated with second-hand booksellers--all save Mifflin. He paced through the narrow aisles, scanning the blissful throng of seekers. He went down to the educational department in the basement, up to the medical books in the gallery, even back to the sections of Drama and Pennsylvania History in the raised quarterdeck at the rear."}, {"size": 257, "text": "There was no trace of Roger.

We haven't seen one for a long time.\" \"Was he a little bald man with a red beard and bright blue eyes?\" asked Aubrey hoarsely. \"Yes--Mr. Mifflin of Brooklyn. Do you know him?\" \"I should say I do!\" cried Aubrey. \"Where has he gone? I've been hunting him all over town, the scoundrel!\" The bookseller, douce man, had seen too many eccentric customers to be shocked by the vehemence of his questioner. \"He was here a moment ago,\" he said gently, and gazed with a mild interest upon the excited young advertising man. \"I daresay you'll find him just outside, in Ludlow Street.\""}, {"size": 678, "text": "The tall man--and I don't see why I should scruple to name him, for it was Philip Warner--explained that Ludlow Street was the narrow alley that runs along one side of Leary's and elbows at right angles behind the shop. Down the flank of the store, along this narrow little street, run shelves of books under a penthouse. It is here that Leary's displays its stock of ragamuffin ten-centers--queer dingy volumes that call to the hearts of gentle questers.

Then, down at the far end, his small face poked into an open volume, he saw Roger.

Look here, here's a copy of Tooke's Pantheon----\" \"What's the idea?\" cried Aubrey harshly. \"Are you trying to kid me? What are you and Weintraub framing up here in Philadelphia?\" Roger's mind came back to Ludlow Street. He looked with some surprise at the flushed face of the young man, and put the book back in its place on the shelf, making a mental note of its location. His disappointment of the morning came back to him with some irritation. \"What are you talking about?\""}, {"size": 610, "text": "he said. \"What the deuce business is it of yours?\" \"I'll make it my business,\" said Aubrey, and shook his fist in the bookseller's face. \"I've been trailing you, you scoundrel, and I want to know what kind of a game you're playing.\" A spot of red spread on Roger's cheekbones. In spite of his apparent demureness he had a pugnacious spirit and a quick fist. \"By the bones of Charles Lamb!\" he said. \"Young man, your manners need mending. If you're looking for display advertising, I'll give you one on each eye.\" Aubrey had expected to find a cringing culprit, and this back talk infuriated him beyond control."}, {"size": 601, "text": "\"You damned little bolshevik,\" he said, \"if you were my size I'd give you a hiding. You tell me what you and your pro-German pals are up to or I'll put the police on you!\" Roger stiffened. His beard bristled, and his blue eyes glittered. \"You impudent dog,\" he said quietly, \"you come round the corner where these people can't see us and I'll give you some private tutoring.\" He led the way round the corner of the alley. In this narrow channel, between blank walls, they confronted each other. \"In the name of Gutenberg,\" said Roger, calling upon his patron saint, \"explain yourself or I'll hit you.\""}, {"size": 611, "text": "\"Who's he?\" sneered Aubrey. \"Another one of your Huns?\" That instant he received a smart blow on the chin, which would have been much harder but that Roger misgauged his footing on the uneven cobbles, and hardly reached the face of his opponent, who topped him by many inches. Aubrey forgot his resolution not to hit a smaller man, and also calling upon his patron saints--the Associated Advertising Clubs of the World--he delivered a smashing slog which hit the bookseller in the chest and jolted him half across the alley.

His head crashed violently on the cobbles, and the old cut on his scalp broke out afresh. Dazed and shaken, there was, for the moment, no more fight in him. \"You insolent pup,\" panted Roger, \"do you want any more?\" Then he saw that Aubrey was really hurt. With horror he observed a trickle of blood run down the side of the young man's face. \"Good Lord,\" he said. \"Maybe I've killed him!\" In a panic he ran round the corner to get Leary's outside man, who stands in a little sentry box at the front angle of the store and sells the outdoor books."}, {"size": 628, "text": "\"Quick,\" he said. \"There's a fellow back here badly hurt.\" They ran back around the corner, and found Aubrey walking rather shakily toward them. Immense relief swam through Roger's brain. \"Look here,\" he said, \"I'm awfully sorry--are you hurt?\" Aubrey glared whitely at him, but was too stunned to speak. He grunted, and the others took him one on each side and supported him. Leary's man ran inside the store and opened the little door of the freight elevator at the back of the shop.

Philip Warner, always resourceful, produced some surgical plaster. Roger wanted to telephone for a doctor. \"Not on your life,\" said Aubrey, pulling himself together. \"See here, Mr. Mifflin, don't flatter yourself you gave me this cut on the skull.

He lifted the receiver. \"Long Distance, please,\" he said. \"Hullo? I want to get Brooklyn, Wordsworth 1617-W.\" They spent a sour twenty-five minutes waiting for the connection.

The whole series of events seemed a grossly fantastic nightmare, yet it frightened him. \"If only I were in Brooklyn,\" he groaned, \"it wouldn't be so bad.

Where are you?\" \"In Philadelphia,\" said Roger. \"Tell me, is everything all right?\" \"Everything's dandy,\" said Titania. \"I'm selling loads of books. Mrs. Mifflin's gone out to do some shopping.\" Aubrey shook to hear the tiny, airy voice, like a trill of birdsong, like a tinkling from some distant star.

Neither of them spoke again until they reached Manhattan Transfer, where they changed for the Hudson Terminal. It was seven o'clock when they hurried out of the subway terminus at Atlantic Avenue.

A dull shining came through them, showing that the lights were turned on inside. But why should the shades be lowered with closing time three hours away?

Aubrey was down the aisle in a flash, followed by Roger, who had delayed just long enough to close the door. He tiptoed up the steps at the back of the shop and looked into the dining room. At the instant his eyes took in the scene it seemed as though the whole room was in motion. The cloth was spread for supper and shone white under the drop lamp. In the far corner of the room Titania was struggling in the grasp of a bearded man whom Aubrey instantly recognized as the chef.

In his tremor of rage and excitement his arms felt curiously weak, and his first thought was how impossible it would be to strangle that swinish neck. For an instant there was a breathless tableau. The bearded man still had his hands on Titania's shoulders.

With his left hand he picked up the druggist's revolver.

I've got a score to settle with him.\" The chef made a movement as though to jump through the window behind him, but Aubrey flung himself upon him. He hit the man square on the nose and felt a delicious throb of satisfaction as the rubbery flesh flattened beneath his knuckles. He seized the man's hairy throat and sank his fingers into it. The other tried to snatch the bread knife on the table, but was too late. He fell to the floor, and Aubrey throttled him savagely. \"You blasted Hun,\" he grunted. \"Go wrestling with girls, will you?\" Titania ran from the room, through the pantry."}, {"size": 646, "text": "Roger was holding Weintraub's revolver in front of the German's face. \"Look here,\" he said, \"what does this mean?\" \"It's all a mistake,\" said the druggist suavely, though his eyes slid uneasily to and fro. \"I just came in to get some books I left here earlier in the afternoon.\" \"With a revolver, eh?\" said Roger. \"Speak up, Hindenburg, what's the big idea?\" \"It's not my revolver,\" said Weintraub. \"It's Metzger's.\" \"Where's this suitcase of yours?\" said Roger. \"We're going to have a look at it.\" \"It's all a stupid mistake,\" said Weintraub. \"I left a suitcase of old books here for Metzger, because I expected to go out of town this afternoon."}, {"size": 600, "text": "He called for it, and your young woman wouldn't give it to him.

Ask them to send a couple of men round here at once.\" \"My dear Mifflin,\" said Weintraub, \"this is very absurd.

Metzger's arm was raised, about to throw the book, when Bock darted at him and buried his teeth in the man's leg. The Cromwell fell from his hand.

With a candle Aubrey found Titania sitting on the floor, very faint, but unhurt. What he had thought was blood proved to be a pool of ink from a quart bottle that had stood over Roger's desk. He picked her up like a child and carried her into the kitchen. \"Stay here and don't stir,\""}, {"size": 600, "text": "he said. By this time a crowd was already gathering on the pavement.

Someone ring for an ambulance.\" The whole front of the Haunted Bookshop was a wreck. In the pale glimmer of the lantern it was a disastrous sight.

Mrs. J. F. Smith left Mrs. Schiller's lodgings, declaring that she would stay no longer in a pro-German colony; and Aubrey was able at last to get a much-needed bath.

Here's Urn Burial, and The Love Affairs of a Bibliomaniac, and Mistletoe's Book of Deplorable Facts. I'm going to have a thorough house-cleaning. I'm thinking seriously of putting in a vacuum cleaner and a cash register. Titania was quite right, the place was too dirty.

She's out with her father. Excuse me, please, I'm going to help Helen get dinner ready.\" Aubrey sat down by the fire, and lit his pipe.

He heard a rustle behind him, and there she was. She had on a gray fur coat and a lively little hat. Her cheeks were delicately tinted by the winter air.

And I want to apologize for the silly things I said that Sunday morning. Will you forgive me?\" Aubrey had never felt his self-salesmanship ability at such a low ebb. To his unspeakable horror, he felt his eyes betray him."}, {"size": 647, "text": "They grew moist. \"Please don't talk like that,\" he said. \"I had no right to do what I did, anyway.

I guess you'd have saved poor Bock's, too, if you could.\" Her eyes filled with tears. \"If anybody deserves credit, it's you,\" he said. \"Why, if it hadn't been for you they'd have been away with that suitcase and probably Metzger would have got his bomb on board the ship and blown up the President----\""}, {"size": 645, "text": "\"I'm not arguing with you,\" she said. \"I'm just thanking you.\" It was a happy little party that sat down in Roger's dining room that evening. Helen had prepared Eggs Samuel Butler in Aubrey's honour, and Mr. Chapman had brought two bottles of champagne to pledge the future success of the bookshop. Aubrey was called upon to announce the result of his conferences with the secret service men who had been looking up Weintraub's record. \"It all seems so simple now,\" he said, \"that I wonder we didn't see through it at once. You see, we all made the mistake of assuming that German plotting would stop automatically when the armistice was signed."}, {"size": 753, "text": "It seems that this man Weintraub was one of the most dangerous spies Germany had in this country. Thirty or forty fires and explosions on our ships at sea are said to have been due to his work. As he had lived here so long and taken out citizen's papers, no one suspected him. But after his death, his wife, whom he had treated very brutally, gave way and told a great deal about his activities. According to her, as soon as it was announced that the President would go to the Peace Conference, Weintraub made up his mind to get a bomb into the President's cabin on board the George Washington. Mrs. Weintraub tried to dissuade him from it, as she was in secret opposed to these murderous plots of his, but he threatened to kill her if she thwarted him."}, {"size": 648, "text": "She lived in terror of her life. I can believe it, for I remember her face when her husband looked at her. \"Of course to make the bomb was simple enough for Weintraub. He had an infernally complete laboratory in the cellar of his house, where he had made hundreds. The problem was, how to make a bomb that would not look suspicious, and how to get it into the President's private cabin. He hit on the idea of binding it into the cover of a book. How he came to choose that particular volume, I don't know.\" \"I think probably I gave him the idea quite innocently,\" said Roger. \"He used to come in here a good deal and one day he asked me whether Mr."}, {"size": 676, "text": "Wilson was a great reader. I said that I believed he was, and then mentioned the Cromwell, which I had heard was one of Wilson's favourite books. Weintraub was much interested and said he must read the book some day. I remember now that he stood in that alcove for some time, looking over it.\" \"Well,\" said Aubrey, \"it must have seemed to him that luck was playing into his hands. This man Metzger, who had been an assistant chef at the Octagon for years, was slated to go on board the George Washington with the party of cooks from that hotel who were to prepare the President's meals. Weintraub was informed of all this from someone higher up in the German spy organization."}, {"size": 749, "text": "Metzger, who was known as Messier at the hotel, was a very clever chef, and had fake passports as a Swiss citizen. He was another tool of the organization. By the original scheme there would have been no direct communication between Weintraub and Metzger, but the go-between was spotted by the Department of Justice on another count, and is now behind bars at Atlanta. \"It seems that Weintraub had conceived the idea that the least suspicious way of passing his messages to Metzger would be to slip them into a copy of some book--a book little likely to be purchased--in a second-hand bookshop. Metzger had been informed what the book was, but--perhaps owing to the unexpected removal of the go-between--did not know in which shop he was to find it."}, {"size": 683, "text": "That explains why so many booksellers had inquiries from him recently for a copy of the Cromwell volume. \"Weintraub, of course, was not at all anxious to have any direct dealings with Metzger, as the druggist had a high regard for his own skin. When the chef was finally informed where the bookshop was in which he was to see the book, he hurried over here. Weintraub had picked out this shop not only because it was as unlikely as any place on earth to be suspected as a channel of spy codes, but also because he had your confidence and could drop in frequently without arousing surprise. The first time Metzger came here happened to be the night I dined with you, as you remember.\""}, {"size": 642, "text": "Roger nodded. \"He asked for the book, and to my surprise, it wasn't there.\" \"No: for the excellent reason that Weintraub had taken it some days before, to measure it so he could build his infernal machine to fit, and also to have it rebound. He needed the original binding as a case for his bomb. The following night, as you told me, it came back. He brought it himself, having provided himself with a key to your front door.\" \"It was gone again on Thursday night, when the Corn Cob Club met here,\" said Mr. Chapman. \"Yes, that time Metzger had taken it,\" said Aubrey. \"He misunderstood his instructions, and thought he was to steal the book."}, {"size": 718, "text": "You see, owing to the absence of their third man, they were working at cross purposes. Metzger, I think, was only intended to get his information out of the book, and leave it where it was. At any rate, he was puzzled, and inserted that ad in the Times the next morning--that LOST ad, you remember. By that, I imagine, he intended to convey the idea that he had located the bookshop, but didn't know what to do next. And the date he mentioned in the ad, midnight on Tuesday, December third, was to inform Weintraub (of whose identity he was still ignorant) when Metzger was to go on board the ship. Weintraub had been instructed by their spy organization to watch the LOST and FOUND ads.\" \"Think of it!\" cried Titania."}, {"size": 738, "text": "\"Well,\" continued Aubrey, \"all this may not be 100 per cent. accurate, but after putting things together this is how it dopes out. Weintraub, who was as canny as they make them, saw he'd have to get into direct touch with Metzger. He sent him word, on the Friday, to come over to see him and bring the book. Metzger, meanwhile, had had a bad fright when I spoke to him in the hotel elevator. He returned the book to the shop that night, as Mrs. Mifflin remembers. Then, when I stopped in at the drug store on my way home, he must have been with Weintraub. I found the Cromwell cover in the drug-store bookcase--why Weintraub was careless enough to leave it there I can't guess--and they spotted me right away as having some kind of hunch."}, {"size": 606, "text": "So they followed me over the Bridge and tried to get rid of me. It was because I got that cover on Friday night that Weintraub broke into the shop again early Sunday morning. He had to have the cover of the book to bind his bomb in.\" Aubrey was agreeably conscious of the close attention of his audience. He caught Titania's gaze, and flushed a little. \"That's pretty nearly all there is to it,\" he said. \"I knew that if those guys were so keen to put me out of the way there must be something rather rotten on foot. I came over to Brooklyn the next afternoon, Saturday, and took a room across the street.\""}, {"size": 655, "text": "\"And we went to the movies,\" chirped Titania. \"The rest of it I think you all know--except Metzger's visit to my lodgings that night.\" He described the incident. \"You see they were trailing me pretty close. If I hadn't happened to notice the cigar at my window I guess he'd have had me on toast. Of course you know how wrongly I doped it out. I thought Mr. Mifflin was running with them, and I owe him my apology for that. He's laid me out once on that score, over in Philadelphia.\" Humourously, Aubrey narrated how he had sleuthed the bookseller to Ludlow Street, and had been worsted in battle. \"I think they counted on disposing of me sooner or later,\""}, {"size": 612, "text": "said Aubrey. \"They framed up that telephone call to get Mr. Mifflin out of town. The point in having Metzger come to the bookshop to get the suitcase was to clear Weintraub's skirts if possible. Apparently it was just a bag of old books. The bombed book, I guess, was perfectly harmless until any one tried to open it.\" \"You both got back just in the nick of time,\" said Titania admiringly. \"You see I was all alone most of the afternoon. Weintraub left the suitcase about two o'clock. Metzger came for it about six. I refused to let him have it.

Then Mrs. Mifflin came in. We let Bock into the yard for a run, and were getting supper. I heard the bell ring, and went into the shop. There were the two Germans, pulling down the shades. I asked what they meant by it, and they grabbed me and told me to shut up.

But we can do something for the rest of us. I've been talking with Titania, Mr. Mifflin.

I thought it was a little too exciting for her."}, {"size": 636, "text": "You know I sent her over here to have a quiet time and calm down a bit. But she wouldn't hear of leaving.

Now if you and Mrs. Mifflin can find the proper people to run them, I'll finance a fleet of ten of those Parnassuses you're always talking about, and have them built in time to go on the road next spring.

You are an honour to human nature, sir, and I hope you'll never live to regret it. This is the happiest moment of my life.\" \"Then that's settled,\" said Mr. Chapman. \"We'll go over the details later. Now there's another thing on my mind.

Naturally a hard-headed business man would not care to entrust such vast interests to a firm whose young men went careering about like secret service agents, hunting for spies, eavesdropping in alleys, and accusing people of pro-germanism. Business, Aubrey said to himself, is built upon Confidence, and what confidence could Mr. Chapman have in such vagabond and romantic doings? Still, he felt that he had done nothing to be ashamed of. \"I'm sorry, sir,\" he said. \"We have tried to give you service. I assure you that I've spent by far the larger part of my time at the office in working up plans for your campaigns.\""}, {"size": 641, "text": "He could not bear to look at Titania, ashamed that she should be the witness of his humiliation. \"That's exactly it,\" said Mr. Chapman. \"I don't want just the larger part of your time. I want all of it. I want you to accept the position of assistant advertising manager of the Daintybits Corporation.\" They all cheered, and for the third time that evening Aubrey felt more overwhelmed than any good advertising man is accustomed to feel. He tried to express his delight, and then added: \"I think it's my turn to propose a toast. I give you the health of Mr. and Mrs. Mifflin, and their Haunted Bookshop, the place where I first--I first----\""}, {"size": 600, "text": "His courage failed him, and he concluded, \"First learned the meaning of literature.\" \"Suppose we adjourn to the den,\" said Helen. \"We have so many delightful things to talk over, and I know Roger wants to tell you all about the improvements he is planning for the shop.\" Aubrey lingered to be the last, and it is to be conjectured that Titania did not drop her handkerchief merely by accident. The others had already crossed the hall into the sitting room. Their eyes met, and Aubrey could feel himself drowned in her steady, honest gaze. He was tortured by the bliss of being so near her, and alone."}, {"size": 468, "text": "The rest of the world seemed to shred away and leave them standing in that little island of light where the tablecloth gleamed under the lamp. In his hand he clutched the precious book. Out of all the thousand things he thought, there was only one he dared to say. \"Will you write my name in it?\" \"I'd love to,\" she said, a little shakily, for she, too, was strangely alarmed at certain throbbings.

Aubrey felt oddly stupefied, and was thinking only of the little golden sparkle of her eyelashes. This time her eyes were the first to turn away. \"You see,\" she said with a funny little quaver, \"I might want to change the wording.\" And she ran from the room. As she entered the den, her father was speaking. \"You know,\" he said, \"I'm rather glad she wants to stay in the book business.\" Roger looked up at her. \"Well,\" he said, \"I believe it agrees with her!"}, {"size": 357, "text": "You know, the beauty of living in a place like this is that you get so absorbed in the books you don't have any temptation to worry about anything else.
