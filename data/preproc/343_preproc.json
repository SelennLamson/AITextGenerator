After the 32nd chapter of _Treasure Island_, two of the puppets strolled out to have a pipe before business should begin again, and met in an open place not far from the story. \"Good-morning, Cap'n,\" said the first, with a man-o'-war salute, and a beaming countenance. \"Ah, Silver!\" grunted the other. \"You're in a bad way, Silver.\" \"Now, Cap'n Smollett,\" remonstrated Silver, \"dooty is dooty, as I knows, and none better; but we're off dooty now; and I can't see no call to keep up the morality business.\""}, {"size": 631, "text": "\"You're a damned rogue, my man,\" said the Captain. \"Come, come, Cap'n, be just,\" returned the other. \"There's no call to be angry with me in earnest. I'm on'y a chara'ter in a sea story. I don't really exist.\" \"Well, I don't really exist either,\" says the Captain, \"which seems to meet that.\" \"I wouldn't set no limits to what a virtuous chara'ter might consider argument,\" responded Silver. \"But I'm the villain of this tale, I am; and speaking as one sea-faring man to another, what I want to know is, what's the odds?\" \"Were you never taught your catechism?\" said the Captain. \"Don't you know there's such a thing as an Author?\""}, {"size": 632, "text": "\"Such a thing as a Author?\" returned John, derisively. \"And who better'n me? And the p'int is, if the Author made you, he made Long John, and he made Hands, and Pew, and George Merry--not that George is up to much, for he's little more'n a name; and he made Flint, what there is of him; and he made this here mutiny, you keep such a work about; and he had Tom Redruth shot; and--well, if that's a Author, give me Pew!\" \"Don't you believe in a future state?\" said Smollett. \"Do you think there's nothing but the present story-paper?\" \"I don't rightly know for that,\" said Silver; \"and I don't see what it's got to do with it, anyway."}, {"size": 656, "text": "What I know is this: if there is sich a thing as a Author, I'm his favourite chara'ter. He does me fathoms better'n he does you--fathoms, he does. And he likes doing me. He keeps me on deck mostly all the time, crutch and all; and he leaves you measling in the hold, where nobody can't see you, nor wants to, and you may lay to that! If there is a Author, by thunder, but he's on my side, and you may lay to it!\" \"I see he's giving you a long rope,\" said the Captain. \"But that can't change a man's convictions. I know the Author respects me; I feel it in my bones; when you and I had that talk at the blockhouse door, who do you think he was for, my man?\""}, {"size": 666, "text": "\"And don't he respect me?\" cried Silver. \"Ah, you should 'a' heard me putting down my mutiny, George Merry and Morgan and that lot, no longer ago'n last chapter; you'd heard something then! You'd 'a' seen what the Author thinks o' me! But come now, do you consider yourself a virtuous chara'ter clean through?\" \"God forbid!\" said Captain Smollett, solemnly. \"I am a man that tries to do his duty, and makes a mess of it as often as not. I'm not a very popular man at home, Silver, I'm afraid!\" and the Captain sighed. \"Ah,\" says Silver. \"Then how about this sequel of yours? Are you to be Cap'n Smollett just the same as ever, and not very popular at home, says you?"}, {"size": 634, "text": "And if so, why, it's _Treasure Island_ over again, by thunder; and I'll be Long John, and Pew'll be Pew, and we'll have another mutiny, as like as not. Or are you to be somebody else? And if so, why, what the better are you? and what the worse am I?\" \"Why, look here, my man,\" returned the Captain, \"I can't understand how this story comes about at all, can I? I can't see how you and I, who don't exist, should get to speaking here, and smoke our pipes for all the world like reality? Very well, then, who am I to pipe up with my opinions? I know the Author's on the side of good; he tells me so, it runs out of his pen as he writes."}, {"size": 628, "text": "Well, that's all I need to know; I'll take my chance upon the rest.\" \"It's a fact he seemed to be against George Merry,\" Silver admitted, musingly. \"But George is little more'n a name at the best of it,\" he added, brightening. \"And to get into soundings for once. What is this good? I made a mutiny, and I been a gentleman o' fortune; well, but by all stories, you ain't no such saint. I'm a man that keeps company very easy; even by your own account, you ain't, and to my certain knowledge you're a devil to haze. Which is which? Which is good, and which bad? Ah, you tell me that! Here we are in stays, and you may lay to it!\""}, {"size": 613, "text": "\"We're none of us perfect,\" replied the Captain. \"That's a fact of religion, my man. All I can say is, I try to do my duty; and if you try to do yours, I can't compliment you on your success.\" \"And so you was the judge, was you?\" said Silver, derisively. \"I would be both judge and hangman for you, my man, and never turn a hair,\" returned the Captain. \"But I get beyond that: it mayn't be sound theology, but it's common sense, that what is good is useful too--or there and thereabout, for I don't set up to be a thinker. Now, where would a story go to if there were no virtuous characters?\" \"If you go to that,\""}, {"size": 744, "text": "replied Silver, \"where would a story begin, if there wasn't no villains?\" \"Well, that's pretty much my thought,\" said Captain Smollett. \"The Author has to get a story; that's what he wants; and to get a story, and to have a man like the doctor (say) given a proper chance, he has to put in men like you and Hands. But he's on the right side; and you mind your eye! You're not through this story yet; there's trouble coming for you.\" \"What'll you bet?\" asked John. \"Much I care if there ain't,\" returned the Captain. \"I'm glad enough to be Alexander Smollett, bad as he is; and I thank my stars upon my knees that I'm not Silver. But there's the ink-bottle opening. To quarters!\" And indeed the Author was just then beginning to write the words:"}, {"size": 643, "text": "II.--THE SINKING SHIP. \"Sir,\" said the first lieutenant, bursting into the Captain's cabin, \"the ship is going down.\" \"Very well, Mr. Spoker,\" said the Captain; \"but that is no reason for going about half-shaved. Exercise your mind a moment, Mr. Spoker, and you will see that to the philosophic eye there is nothing new in our position: the ship (if she is to go down at all) may be said to have been going down since she was launched.\" \"She is settling fast,\" said the first lieutenant, as he returned from shaving. \"Fast, Mr. Spoker?\" asked the Captain. \"The expression is a strange one, for time (if you will think of it) is only relative.\""}, {"size": 659, "text": "\"Sir,\" said the lieutenant, \"I think it is scarcely worth while to embark in such a discussion when we shall all be in Davy Jones's Locker in ten minutes.\" \"By parity of reasoning,\" returned the Captain gently, \"it would never be worth while to begin any inquiry of importance; the odds are always overwhelming that we must die before we shall have brought it to an end. You have not considered, Mr. Spoker, the situation of man,\" said the Captain, smiling, and shaking his head. \"I am much more engaged in considering the position of the ship,\" said Mr. Spoker. \"Spoken like a good officer,\" replied the Captain, laying his hand on the lieutenant's shoulder."}, {"size": 604, "text": "On deck they found the men had broken into the spirit-room, and were fast getting drunk. \"My men,\" said the Captain, \"there is no sense in this. The ship is going down, you will tell me, in ten minutes: well, and what then? To the philosophic eye, there is nothing new in our position. All our lives long, we may have been about to break a blood-vessel or to be struck by lightning, not merely in ten minutes, but in ten seconds; and that has not prevented us from eating dinner, no, nor from putting money in the Savings Bank. I assure you, with my hand on my heart, I fail to comprehend your attitude.\""}, {"size": 606, "text": "The men were already too far gone to pay much heed. \"This is a very painful sight, Mr. Spoker,\" said the Captain. \"And yet to the philosophic eye, or whatever it is,\" replied the first lieutenant, \"they may be said to have been getting drunk since they came aboard.\" \"I do not know if you always follow my thought, Mr. Spoker,\" returned the Captain gently. \"But let us proceed.\" In the powder magazine they found an old salt smoking his pipe. \"Good God,\" cried the Captain, \"what are you about?\" \"Well, sir,\" said the old salt, apologetically, \"they told me as she were going down.\" \"And suppose she were?\""}, {"size": 885, "text": "said the Captain. \"To the philosophic eye, there would be nothing new in our position. Life, my old shipmate, life, at any moment and in any view, is as dangerous as a sinking ship; and yet it is man's handsome fashion to carry umbrellas, to wear indiarubber over- shoes, to begin vast works, and to conduct himself in every way as if he might hope to be eternal. And for my own poor part I should despise the man who, even on board a sinking ship, should omit to take a pill or to wind up his watch. That, my friend, would not be the human attitude.\" \"I beg pardon, sir,\" said Mr. Spoker. \"But what is precisely the difference between shaving in a sinking ship and smoking in a powder magazine?\" \"Or doing anything at all in any conceivable circumstances?\" cried the Captain. \"Perfectly conclusive; give me a cigar!\" Two minutes afterwards the ship blew up with a glorious detonation."}, {"size": 752, "text": "III--THE TWO MATCHES. One day there was a traveller in the woods in California, in the dry season, when the Trades were blowing strong. He had ridden a long way, and he was tired and hungry, and dismounted from his horse to smoke a pipe. But when he felt in his pocket he found but two matches. He struck the first, and it would not light.\"Here is a pretty state of things!\" said the traveller. \"Dying for a smoke; only one match left; and that certain to miss fire! Was there ever a creature so unfortunate? And yet,\" thought the traveller, \"suppose I light this match, and smoke my pipe, and shake out the dottle here in the grass--the grass might catch on fire, for it is dry like tinder; and while I snatch out the flames in front, they might evade"}, {"size": 820, "text": "and run behind me, and seize upon yon bush of poison oak; before I could reach it, that would have blazed up; over the bush I see a pine tree hung with moss; that too would fly in fire upon the instant to its topmost bough; and the flame of that long torch--how would the trade wind take and brandish that through the inflammable forest! I hear this dell roar in a moment with the joint voice of wind and fire, I see myself gallop for my soul, and the flying conflagration chase and outflank me through the hills; I see this pleasant forest burn for days, and the cattle roasted, and the springs dried up, and the farmer ruined, and his children cast upon the world. What a world hangs upon this moment!\" With that he struck the match, and it missed fire. \"Thank God!\" said the traveller, and put his pipe in his pocket."}, {"size": 630, "text": "IV.--THE SICK MAN AND THE FIREMAN. There was once a sick man in a burning house, to whom there entered a fireman. \"Do not save me,\" said the sick man. \"Save those who are strong.\" \"Will you kindly tell me why?\" inquired the fireman, for he was a civil fellow. \"Nothing could possibly be fairer,\" said the sick man. \"The strong should be preferred in all cases, because they are of more service in the world.\" The fireman pondered a while, for he was a man of some philosophy. \"Granted,\" said he at last, as apart of the roof fell in; \"but for the sake of conversation, what would you lay down as the proper service of the strong?\""}, {"size": 438, "text": "\"Nothing can possibly be easier,\" returned the sick man; \"the proper service of the strong is to help the weak.\" Again the fireman reflected, for there was nothing hasty about this excellent creature. \"I could forgive you being sick,\" he said at last, as a portion of the wall fell out, \"but I cannot bear your being such a fool.\" And with that he heaved up his fireman's axe, for he was eminently just, and clove the sick man to the bed."}, {"size": 837, "text": "V.--THE DEVIL AND THE INNKEEPER. Once upon a time the devil stayed at an inn, where no one knew him, for they were people whose education had been neglected. He was bent on mischief, and for a time kept everybody by the ears. But at last the innkeeper set a watch upon the devil and took him in the fact. The innkeeper got a rope's end. \"Now I am going to thrash you,\" said the innkeeper. \"You have no right to be angry with me,\" said the devil. \"I am only the devil, and it is my nature to do wrong.\" \"Is that so?\" asked the innkeeper. \"Fact, I assure you,\" said the devil. \"You really cannot help doing ill?\" asked the innkeeper. \"Not in the smallest,\" said the devil; \"it would be useless cruelty to thrash a thing like me.\" \"It would indeed,\" said the innkeeper. And he made a noose and hanged the devil. \"There!\" said the innkeeper."}, {"size": 617, "text": "A man met a lad weeping. \"What do you weep for?\" he asked. \"I am weeping for my sins,\" said the lad. \"You must have little to do,\" said the man. The next day they met again. Once more the lad was weeping. \"Why do you weep now?\" asked the man. \"I am weeping because I have nothing to eat,\" said the lad. \"I thought it would come to that,\" said the man. VII.--THE YELLOW PAINT.In a certain city there lived a physician who sold yellow paint. This was of so singular a virtue that whoso was bedaubed with it from head to heel was set free from the dangers of life, and the bondage of sin, and the fear of death for ever."}, {"size": 799, "text": "So the physician said in his prospectus; and so said all the citizens in the city; and there was nothing more urgent in men's hearts than to be properly painted themselves, and nothing they took more delight in than to see others painted. There was in the same city a young man of a very good family but of a somewhat reckless life, who had reached the age of manhood, and would have nothing to say to the paint: \"To-morrow was soon enough,\" said he; and when the morrow came he would still put it off. She might have continued to do until his death; only, he had a friend of about his own age and much of his own manners; and this youth, taking a walk in the public street, with not one fleck of paint upon his body, was suddenly run down by a water-cart and cut off in the heyday of his nakedness."}, {"size": 677, "text": "This shook the other to the soul; so that I never beheld a man more earnest to be painted; and on the very same evening, in the presence of all his family, to appropriate music, and himself weeping aloud, he received three complete coats and a touch of varnish on the top. The physician (who was himself affected even to tears) protested he had never done a job so thorough. Some two months afterwards, the young man was carried on a stretcher to the physician's house. \"What is the meaning of this?\" he cried, as soon as the door was opened. \"I was to be set free from all the dangers of life; and here have I been run down by that self-same water-cart, and my leg is broken.\""}, {"size": 652, "text": "\"Dear me!\" said the physician. \"This is very sad. But I perceive I must explain to you the action of my paint. A broken bone is a mighty small affair at the worst of it; and it belongs to a class of accident to which my paint is quite inapplicable. Sin, my dear young friend, sin is the sole calamity that a wise man should apprehend; it is against sin that I have fitted you out; and when you come to be tempted, you will give me news of my paint.\" \"Oh!\" said the young man, \"I did not understand that, and it seems rather disappointing. But I have no doubt all is for the best; and in the meanwhile, I shall be obliged to you if you will set my leg.\""}, {"size": 633, "text": "\"That is none of my business,\" said the physician; \"but if your bearers will carry you round the corner to the surgeon's, I feel sure he will afford relief.\" Some three years later, the young man came running to the physician's house in a great perturbation. \"What is the meaning of this?\" he cried. \"Here was I to be set free from the bondage of sin; and I have just committed forgery, arson and murder.\" \"Dear me,\" said the physician. \"This is very serious. Off with your clothes at once.\" And as soon as the young man had stripped, he examined him from head to foot. \"No,\" he cried with great relief, \"there is not a flake broken."}, {"size": 753, "text": "Cheer up, my young friend, your paint is as good as new.\" \"Good God!\" cried the young man, \"and what then can be the use of it?\" \"Why,\" said the physician, \"I perceive I must explain to you the nature of the action of my paint. It does not exactly prevent sin; it extenuates instead the painful consequences. It is not so much for this world, as for the next; it is not against life; in short, it is against death that I have fitted you out. And when you come to die, you will give me news of my paint.\" \"Oh!\" cried the young man, \"I had not understood that, and it seems a little disappointing. But there is no doubt all is for the best: and in the meanwhile, I shall be obliged if you will help me to undo the evil I have brought on innocent persons.\""}, {"size": 658, "text": "\"That is none of my business,\" said the physician; \"but if you will go round the corner to the police office, I feel sure it will afford you relief to give yourself up.\" Six weeks later, the physician was called to the town gaol. \"What is the meaning of this?\" cried the young man. \"Here am I literally crusted with your paint; and I have broken my leg, and committed all the crimes in the calendar, and must be hanged to-morrow; and am in the meanwhile in a fear so extreme that I lack words to picture it.\" \"Dear me,\" said the physician. \"This is really amazing. Well, well; perhaps, if you had not been painted, you would have been more frightened still.\""}, {"size": 607, "text": "VIII.--THE HOUSE OF ELD. So soon as the child began to speak, the gyve was riveted; and the boys and girls limped about their play like convicts. Doubtless it was more pitiable to see and more painful to bear in youth; but even the grown folk, besides being very unhandy on their feet, were often sick with ulcers. About the time when Jack was ten years old, many strangers began to journey through that country. These he beheld going lightly by on the long roads, and the thing amazed him. \"I wonder how it comes,\" he asked, \"that all these strangers are so quick afoot, and we must drag about our fetter?\""}, {"size": 731, "text": "\"My dear boy,\" said his uncle, the catechist, \"do not complain about your fetter, for it is the only thing that makes life worth living. None are happy, none are good, none are respectable, that are not gyved like us. And I must tell you, besides, it is very dangerous talk. If you grumble of your iron, you will have no luck; if ever you take it off, you will be instantly smitten by a thunderbolt.\" \"Are there no thunderbolts for these strangers?\" asked Jack. \"Jupiter is longsuffering to the benighted,\" returned the catechist. \"Upon my word, I could wish I had been less fortunate,\" said Jack. \"For if I had been born benighted, I might now be going free; and it cannot be denied the iron is inconvenient, and the ulcer hurts.\""}, {"size": 641, "text": "\"Ah!\" cried his uncle, \"do not envy the heathen! Theirs is a sad lot! Ah, poor souls, if they but knew the joys of being fettered! Poor souls, my heart yearns for them. But the truth is they are vile, odious, insolent, ill-conditioned, stinking brutes, not truly human--for what is a man without a fetter?--and you cannot be too particular not to touch or speak with them.\" After this talk, the child would never pass one of the unfettered on the road but what he spat at him and called him names, which was the practice of the children in that part. It chanced one day, when he was fifteen, he went into the woods, and the ulcer pained him."}, {"size": 765, "text": "It was a fair day, with a blue sky; all the birds were singing; but Jack nursed his foot. Presently, another song began; it sounded like the singing of a person, only far more gay; at the same time there was a beating on the earth. Jack put aside the leaves; and there was a lad of his own village, leaping, and dancing and singing to himself in a green dell; and on the grass beside him lay the dancer's iron. \"Oh!\" cried Jack, \"you have your fetter off!\" \"For God's sake, don't tell your uncle!\" cried the lad. \"If you fear my uncle,\" returned Jack \"why do you not fear the thunderbolt\"? \"That is only an old wives' tale,\" said the other. \"It is only told to children. Scores of us come here among the woods and dance for nights together, and are none the worse.\""}, {"size": 631, "text": "This put Jack in a thousand new thoughts. He was a grave lad; he had no mind to dance himself; he wore his fetter manfully, and tended his ulcer without complaint. But he loved the less to be deceived or to see others cheated. He began to lie in wait for heathen travellers, at covert parts of the road, and in the dusk of the day, so that he might speak with them unseen; and these were greatly taken with their wayside questioner, and told him things of weight. The wearing of gyves (they said) was no command of Jupiter's. It was the contrivance of a white-faced thing, a sorcerer, that dwelt in that country in the Wood of Eld."}, {"size": 623, "text": "He was one like Glaucus that could change his shape, yet he could be always told; for when he was crossed, he gobbled like a turkey. He had three lives; but the third smiting would make an end of him indeed; and with that his house of sorcery would vanish, the gyves fall, and the villagers take hands and dance like children. \"And in your country?\" Jack would ask. But at this the travellers, with one accord, would put him off; until Jack began to suppose there was no land entirely happy. Or, if there were, it must be one that kept its folk at home; which was natural enough. But the case of the gyves weighed upon him."}, {"size": 709, "text": "The sight of the children limping stuck in his eyes; the groans of such as dressed their ulcers haunted him. And it came at last in his mind that he was born to free them. There was in that village a sword of heavenly forgery, beaten upon Vulcan's anvil. It was never used but in the temple, and then the flat of it only; and it hung on a nail by the catechist's chimney. Early one night, Jack rose, and took the sword, and was gone out of the house and the village in the darkness. All night he walked at a venture; and when day came, he met strangers going to the fields. Then he asked after the Wood of Eld and the house of sorcery; and one said north, and one south; until Jack saw that they deceived him."}, {"size": 709, "text": "So then, when he asked his way of any man, he showed the bright sword naked; and at that the gyve on the man's ankle rang, and answered in his stead; and the word was still _Straight on_. But the man, when his gyve spoke, spat and struck at Jack, and threw stones at him as he went away; so that his head was broken. So he came to that wood, and entered in, and he was aware of a house in a low place, where funguses grew, and the trees met, and the steaming of the marsh arose about it like a smoke. It was a fine house, and a very rambling; some parts of it were ancient like the hills, and some but of yesterday, and none finished; and all the ends of it were open, so that you could go in from every side."}, {"size": 711, "text": "Yet it was in good repair, and all the chimneys smoked. Jack went in through the gable; and there was one room after another, all bare, but all furnished in part, so that a man could dwell there; and in each there was a fire burning, where a man could warm himself, and a table spread where he might eat. But Jack saw nowhere any living creature; only the bodies of some stuffed. \"This is a hospitable house,\" said Jack; \"but the ground must be quaggy underneath, for at every step the building quakes.\" He had gone some time in the house, when he began to be hungry. Then he looked at the food, and at first he was afraid; but he bared the sword, and by the shining of the sword, it seemed the food was honest."}, {"size": 645, "text": "So he took the courage to sit down and eat, and he was refreshed in mind and body. \"This is strange,\" thought he, \"that in the house of sorcery there should be food so wholesome.\" As he was yet eating, there came into that room the appearance of his uncle, and Jack was afraid because he had taken the sword. But his uncle was never more kind, and sat down to meat with him, and praised him because he had taken the sword. Never had these two been more pleasantly together, and Jack was full of love to the man. \"It was very well done,\" said his uncle, \"to take the sword and come yourself into the House of Eld; a good thought and a brave deed."}, {"size": 713, "text": "But now you are satisfied; and we may go home to dinner arm in arm.\" \"Oh, dear, no!\" said Jack. \"I am not satisfied yet.\" \"How!\" cried his uncle. \"Are you not warmed by the fire? Does not this food sustain you?\" \"I see the food to be wholesome,\" said Jack; \"and still it is no proof that a man should wear a gyve on his right leg.\" Now at this the appearance of his uncle gobbled like a turkey. \"Jupiter!\" cried Jack, \"is this the sorcerer?\" His hand held back and his heart failed him for the love he bore his uncle; but he heaved up the sword and smote the appearance on the head; and it cried out aloud with the voice of his uncle; and fell to the ground; and a little bloodless white thing fled from the room."}, {"size": 604, "text": "The cry rang in Jack's ears, and his knees smote together, and conscience cried upon him; and yet he was strengthened, and there woke in his bones the lust of that enchanter's blood. \"If the gyves are to fall,\" said he, \"I must go through with this, and when I get home I shall find my uncle dancing.\" So he went on after the bloodless thing. In the way, he met the appearance of his father; and his father was incensed, and railed upon him, and called to him upon his duty, and bade him be home, while there was yet time. \"For you can still,\" said he, \"be home by sunset; and then all will be forgiven.\""}, {"size": 643, "text": "\"God knows,\" said Jack, \"I fear your anger; but yet your anger does not prove that a man should wear a gyve on his right leg.\" And at that the appearance of his father gobbled like a turkey. \"Ah, heaven,\" cried Jack, \"the sorcerer again!\" The blood ran backward in his body and his joints rebelled against him for the love he bore his father; but he heaved up the sword, and plunged it in the heart of the appearance; and the appearance cried out aloud with the voice of his father; and fell to the ground; and a little bloodless white thing fled from the room. The cry rang in Jack's ears, and his soul was darkened; but now rage came to him."}, {"size": 610, "text": "\"I have done what I dare not think upon,\" said he. \"I will go to an end with it, or perish. And when I get home, I pray God this may be a dream, and I may find my father dancing.\" So he went on after the bloodless thing that had escaped; and in the way he met the appearance of his mother, and she wept. \"What have you done?\" she cried. \"What is this that you have done? Oh, come home (where you may be by bedtime) ere you do more ill to me and mine; for it is enough to smite my brother and your father.\" \"Dear mother, it is not these that I have smitten,\" said Jack; \"it was but the enchanter in their shape."}, {"size": 602, "text": "And even if I had, it would not prove that a man should wear a gyve on his right leg.\" And at this the appearance gobbled like a turkey. He never knew how he did that; but he swung the sword on the one side, and clove the appearance through the midst; and it cried out aloud with the voice of his mother; and fell to the ground; and with the fall of it, the house was gone from over Jack's head, and he stood alone in the woods, and the gyve was loosened from his leg. \"Well,\" said he, \"the enchanter is now dead, and the fetter gone.\" But the cries rang in his soul, and the day was like night to him."}, {"size": 623, "text": "\"This has been a sore business,\" said he. \"Let me get forth out of the wood, and see the good that I have done to others.\" He thought to leave the fetter where it lay, but when he turned to go, his mind was otherwise. So he stooped and put the gyve in his bosom; and the rough iron galled him as he went, and his bosom bled. Now when he was forth of the wood upon the highway, he met folk returning from the field; and those he met had no fetter on the right leg, but, behold! they had one upon the left. Jack asked them what it signified; and they said, \"that was the new wear, for the old was found to be a superstition\"."}, {"size": 394, "text": "Then he looked at them nearly; and there was a new ulcer on the left ankle, and the old one on the right was not yet healed. \"Now, may God forgive me!\" cried Jack. \"I would I were well home.\" And when he was home, there lay his uncle smitten on the head, and his father pierced through the heart, and his mother cloven through the midst.

Now the saddle-horse had never seen creatures so big. \"These must be great chiefs,\" thought he, and he approached them civilly. \"Lady and gentleman,\" said he, \"I understand you are from the colonies.

The natives told him many tales. In particular, they warned him of the house of yellow reeds tied with black sinnet, how any one who touched it became instantly the prey of Akaanga, and was handed on to him by Miru the ruddy, and hocussed with the kava of the dead, and baked in the ovens and eaten by the eaters of the dead. \"There is nothing in it,\" said the missionary.There was a bay upon that island, a very fair bay to look upon; but, by the native saying, it was death to bathe there."}, {"size": 671, "text": "\"There is nothing in that,\" said the missionary; and he came to the bay, and went swimming. Presently an eddy took him and bore him towards the reef. \"Oho!\" thought the missionary, \"it seems there is something in it after all.\" And he swam the harder, but the eddy carried him away. \"I do not care about this eddy,\" said the missionary; and even as he said it, he was aware of a house raised on piles above the sea; it was built of yellow reeds, one reed joined with another, and the whole bound with black sinnet; a ladder led to the door, and all about the house hung calabashes. He had never seen such a house, nor yet such calabashes; and the eddy set for the ladder."}, {"size": 678, "text": "\"This is singular,\" said the missionary, \"but there can be nothing in it.\" And he laid hold of the ladder and went up.

Now he had no sooner laid hand upon the calabash than that which he handled, and that which he saw and stood on, burst like a bubble and was gone; and night closed upon him, and the waters, and the meshes of the net; and he wallowed there like a fish."}, {"size": 652, "text": "\"A body would think there was something in this,\" said the missionary. \"But if these tales are true, I wonder what about my tales!\" Now the flaming of Akaanga's torch drew near in the night; and the misshapen hands groped in the meshes of the net; and they took the missionary between the finger and the thumb, and bore him dripping in the night and silence to the place of the ovens of Miru. And there was Miru, ruddy in the glow of the ovens; and there sat her four daughters, and made the kava of the dead; and there sat the comers out of the islands of the living, dripping and lamenting. This was a dread place to reach for any of the sons of men."}, {"size": 722, "text": "But of all who ever came there, the missionary was the most concerned; and, to make things worse, the person next him was a convert of his own. \"Aha,\" said the convert, \"so you are here like your neighbours?

And then he remembered, and put it back. \"Drink!\" sang the daughter of Miru. \"There is no kava like the kava of the dead, and to drink of it once is the reward of living.\" \"I thank you. It smells excellent,\" said the missionary. \"But I am a blue-ribbon man myself; and though I am aware there is a difference of opinion even in our own confession, I have always held kava to be excluded.\""}, {"size": 694, "text": "\"What!\" cried the convert. \"Are you going to respect a taboo at a time like this? And you were always so opposed to taboos when you were alive!\" \"To other people's,\" said the missionary. \"Never to my own.\" \"But yours have all proved wrong,\" said the convert. \"It looks like it,\" said the missionary, \"and I can't help that. No reason why I should break my word.\" \"I never heard the like of this!\" cried the daughter of Miru. \"Pray, what do you expect to gain?\" \"That is not the point,\" said the missionary. \"I took this pledge for others, I am not going to break it for myself.\" The daughter of Miru was puzzled; she came and told her mother, and Miru was vexed; and they went and told Akaanga."}, {"size": 769, "text": "\"I don't know what to do about this,\" said Akaanga; and he came and reasoned with the missionary. \"But there _is_ such a thing as right and wrong,\" said the missionary; \"and your ovens cannot alter that.\" \"Give the kava to the rest,\" said Akaanga to the daughters of Miru. \"I must get rid of this sea-lawyer instantly, or worse will come of it.\" The next moment the missionary came up in the midst of the sea, and there before him were the palm trees of the island. He swam to the shore gladly, and landed. Much matter of thought was in that missionary's mind. \"I seem to have been misinformed upon some points,\" said he. \"Perhaps there is not much in it, as I supposed; but there is something in it after all.

In the ancient days there went three men upon pilgrimage; one was a priest, and one was a virtuous person, and the third was an old rover with his axe. As they went, the priest spoke about the grounds of faith. \"We find the proofs of our religion in the works of nature,\" said he, and beat his breast. \"That is true,\" said the virtuous person. \"The peacock has a scrannel voice,\""}, {"size": 653, "text": "said the priest, \"as has been laid down always in our books.

Great is the truth, and shall prevail!\" \"The devil fly away with that peacock!\" said the priest; and he was downcast for a mile or two. But presently they came to a shrine, where a Fakeer performed miracles. \"Ah!\" said the priest, \"here are the true grounds of faith. The peacock was but an adminicle. This is the base of our religion.\" And he beat upon his breast, and groaned like one with colic. \"Now to me,\" said the virtuous person, \"all this is as little to the purpose as the peacock. I believe because I see the right is great and must prevail; and this Fakeer might carry on with his conjuring tricks till doomsday, and it would not play bluff upon a man like me.\""}, {"size": 740, "text": "Now at this the Fakeer was so much incensed that his hand trembled; and, lo! in the midst of a miracle the cards fell from up his sleeve. \"Where are you now?\" asked the virtuous person. \"And yet it shakes not me!\" \"The devil fly away with the Fakeer!\" cried the priest. \"I really do not see the good of going on with this pilgrimage.\" \"Cheer up!\" cried the virtuous person. \"Great is the right, and shall prevail!\" \"If you are quite sure it will prevail,\" says the priest. \"I pledge my word for that,\" said the virtuous person.

At last one came running, and told them all was lost: that the powers of darkness had besieged the Heavenly Mansions, that Odin was to die, and evil triumph."}, {"size": 353, "text": "\"I have been grossly deceived,\" cried the virtuous person. \"All is lost now,\" said the priest. \"I wonder if it is too late to make it up with the devil?\" said the virtuous person. \"Oh, I hope not,\" said the priest. \"And at any rate we can but try. But what are you doing with your axe?\" says he to the rover. \"I am off to die with Odin,\" said the rover."}, {"size": 631, "text": "XVIII.--THE TOUCHSTONE. The King was a man that stood well before the world; his smile was sweet as clover, but his soul withinsides was as little as a pea. He had two sons; and the younger son was a boy after his heart, but the elder was one whom he feared. It befell one morning that the drum sounded in the dun before it was yet day; and the King rode with his two sons, and a brave array behind them.

And in the meanwhile the two lads looked upon the maid, and the one grew pale and the other red; and the maid looked upon the ground smiling. \"Here is the maid that I shall marry,\" said the elder. \"For I think she smiled upon me.\" But the younger plucked his father by the sleeve."}, {"size": 678, "text": "\"Father,\" said he, \"a word in your ear.

Before it was day, the elder son arose, and he found the maid at her weaving, for she was a diligent girl."}, {"size": 696, "text": "\"Maid,\" quoth he, \"I would fain marry you.\" \"You must speak with my father,\" said she, and she looked upon the ground smiling, and became like the rose. \"Her heart is with me,\" said the elder son, and he went down to the lake and sang.

For I am part of a man; and I was a part of your fathers, and went out to fish and fight with them in the ancient days."}, {"size": 760, "text": "But now is my turn not yet come; and I wait until you have a wife, and then shall I be in your son, and a brave part of him, rejoicing manfully to launch the boat into the surf, skilful to direct the helm, and a man of might where the ring closes and the blows are going.\" \"This is a marvellous thing to hear,\" said the man; \"and if you are indeed to be my son, I fear it will go ill with you; for I am bitter poor in goods and bitter ugly in face, and I shall never get me a wife if I live to the age of eagles.\" \"All this hate I come to remedy, my Father,\" said the Poor Thing; \"for we must go this night to the little isle of sheep, where our fathers lie in the dead-cairn, and to-morrow to the Earl's Hall, and there shall you find a wife by my providing.\""}, {"size": 628, "text": "So the man rose and put forth his boat at the time of the sunsetting; and the Poor Thing sat in the prow, and the spray blew through his bones like snow, and the wind whistled in his teeth, and the boat dipped not with the weight of him. \"I am fearful to see you, my son,\" said the man. \"For methinks you are no thing of God.\" \"It is only the wind that whistles in my teeth,\" said the Poor Thing, \"and there is no life in me to keep it out.\" So they came to the little isle of sheep, where the surf burst all about it in the midst of the sea, and it was all green with bracken, and all wet with dew, and the moon enlightened it."}, {"size": 675, "text": "They ran the boat into a cove, and set foot to land; and the man came heavily behind among the rocks in the deepness of the bracken, but the Poor Thing went before him like a smoke in the light of the moon.

But now are we broken in sunder, and the bonds of our bones are loosed, and our thoughts lie in the dust.\" Then said the Poor Thing: \"Charge them that they give you the virtue they withheld\"."}, {"size": 624, "text": "And the man said: \"Bones of my fathers, greeting! for I am sprung of your loins.

Stoop your hand among the bones without drawback, and you shall find their treasure.\" So the man stooped his hand, and the dead laid hold upon it many and faint like ants; but he shook them off, and behold, what he brought up in his hand was the shoe of a horse, and it was rusty."}, {"size": 718, "text": "\"It is a thing of no price,\" quoth the man, \"for it is rusty.\" \"We shall see that,\" said the Poor Thing; \"for in my thought it is a good thing to do what our fathers did, and to keep what they kept without question.

So they set foot to shore; and the man went up to the market among the fishers over against the palace and the Kirk; and he was bitter poor and bitter ugly, and he had never a fish to sell, but only a shoe of a horse in his creel, and it rusty."}, {"size": 665, "text": "\"Now,\" said the Poor Thing, \"do so and so, and you shall find a wife and I a mother.\" It befell that the Earl's daughter came forth to go into the Kirk upon her prayers; and when she saw the poor man stand in the market with only the shoe of a horse, and it rusty, it came in her mind it should be a thing of price. \"What is that?\" quoth she. \"It is a shoe of a horse,\" said the man. \"And what is the use of it?\" quoth the Earl's daughter. \"It is for no use,\" said the man. \"I may not believe that,\" said she; \"else why should you carry it?\" \"I do so,\" said he, \"because it was so my fathers did in the ancient ages; and I have neither a better reason nor a worse.\""}, {"size": 789, "text": "Now the Earl's daughter could not find it in her mind to believe him. \"Come,\" quoth she, \"sell me this, for I am sure it is a thing of price.\" \"Nay,\" said the man, \"the thing is not for sale.\" \"What!\" cried the Earl's daughter. \"Then what make you here in the town's market, with the thing in your creel and nought beside?\" \"I sit here,\" says the man, \"to get me a wife.\" \"There is no sense in any of these answers,\" thought the Earl's daughter; \"and I could find it in my heart to weep.\" By came the Earl upon that; and she called him and told him all.

If I come not to the bottom of this thing, I shall have no more pleasure in bread; and I can see no way, but either I should hang or you should marry him.\" \"By my troth, but he is bitter ugly,\" said the Earl's daughter. \"How if the gallows be so near at hand?\""}, {"size": 663, "text": "\"It was not so,\" said the Earl, \"that my fathers did in the ancient ages.

Bitter ugly I am, and what of that? It was so my fathers--\" \"In the name of God,\" said the Earl's daughter, \"let your fathers be!\" \"If I had done that,\" said the man, \"you had never been chaffering with me here in the market, nor your father the Earl watching with the end of his eye.\""}, {"size": 272, "text": "\"But come,\" quoth the Earl's daughter, \"this is a very strange thing, that you would have me wed for a shoe of a horse, and it rusty.\" \"In my thought,\" quoth the man, \"one thing is as good--\" \"Oh, spare me that,\" said the Earl's daughter, \"and tell me why I should marry.\""}, {"size": 747, "text": "\"Listen and look,\" said the man. Now the wind blew through the Poor Thing like an infant crying, so that her heart was melted; and her eyes were unsealed, and she was aware of the thing as it were a babe unmothered, and she took it to her arms, and it melted in her arms like the air. \"Come,\" said the man, \"behold a vision of our children, the busy hearth, and the white heads. And let that suffice, for it is all God offers.\" \"I have no delight in it,\" said she; but with that she sighed. \"The ways of life are straight like the grooves of launching,\" said the man; and he took her by the hand. \"And what shall we do with the horseshoe?\" quoth she. \"I will give it to your father,\" said the man; \"and he can make a kirk and a mill of it for me.\""}, {"size": 663, "text": "It came to pass in time that the Poor Thing was born; but memory of these matters slept within him, and he knew not that which he had done.

XX.--THE SONG OF THE MORROW. The King of Duntrine had a daughter when he was old, and she was the fairest King's daughter between two seas; her hair was like spun gold, and her eyes like pools in a river; and the King gave her a castle upon the sea beach, with a terrace, and a court of the hewn stone, and four towers at the four corners."}, {"size": 636, "text": "Here she dwelt and grew up, and had no care for the morrow, and no power upon the hour, after the manner of simple men. It befell that she walked one day by the beach of the sea, when it was autumn, and the wind blew from the place of rains; and upon the one hand of her the sea beat, and upon the other the dead leaves ran. This was the loneliest beach between two seas, and strange things had been done there in the ancient ages. Now the King's daughter was aware of a crone that sat upon the beach. The sea foam ran to her feet, and the dead leaves swarmed about her back, and the rags blew about her face in the blowing of the wind."}, {"size": 604, "text": "\"Now,\" said the King's daughter, and she named a holy name, \"this is the most unhappy old crone between two seas.\" \"Daughter of a King,\" said the crone, \"you dwell in a stone house, and your hair is like the gold: but what is your profit? Life is not long, nor lives strong; and you live after the way of simple men, and have no thought for the morrow and no power upon the hour.\" \"Thought for the morrow, that I have,\" said the King's daughter; \"but power upon the hour, that have I not.\" And she mused with herself. Then the crone smote her lean hands one within the other, and laughed like a sea-gull."}, {"size": 642, "text": "\"Home!\" cried she. \"O daughter of a King, home to your stone house; for the longing is come upon you now, nor can you live any more after the manner of simple men. Home, and toil and suffer, till the gift come that will make you bare, and till the man come that will bring you care.\" The King's daughter made no more ado, but she turned about and went home to her house in silence. And when she was come into her chamber she called for her nurse. \"Nurse,\" said the King's daughter, \"thought is come upon me for the morrow, so that I can live no more after the manner of simple men. Tell me what I must do that I may have power upon the hour.\""}, {"size": 671, "text": "Then the nurse moaned like a snow wind. \"Alas!\" said she, \"that this thing should be; but the thought is gone into your marrow, nor is there any cure against the thought. Be it so, then, even as you will; though power is less than weakness, power shall you have; and though the thought is colder than winter, yet shall you think it to an end.\" So the King's daughter sat in her vaulted chamber in the masoned house, and she thought upon the thought. Nine years she sat; and the sea beat upon the terrace, and the gulls cried about the turrets, and wind crooned in the chimneys of the house. Nine years she came not abroad, nor tasted the clean air, neither saw God's sky."}, {"size": 683, "text": "Nine years she sat and looked neither to the right nor to the left, nor heard speech of any one, but thought upon the thought of the morrow. And her nurse fed her in silence, and she took of the food with her left hand, and ate it without grace. Now when the nine years were out, it fell dusk in the autumn, and there came a sound in the wind like a sound of piping. At that the nurse lifted up her finger in the vaulted house. \"I hear a sound in the wind,\" said she, \"that is like the sound of piping.\" \"It is but a little sound,\" said the King's daughter, \"but yet is it sound enough for me.\" So they went down in the dusk to the doors of the house, and along the beach of the sea."}, {"size": 648, "text": "And the waves beat upon the one hand, and upon the other the dead leaves ran; and the clouds raced in the sky, and the gulls flew widdershins. And when they came to that part of the beach where strange things had been done in the ancient ages, lo, there was the crone, and she was dancing widdershins. \"What makes you dance widdershins, old crone?\" said the King's daughter; \"here upon the bleak beach, between the waves and the dead leaves?\" \"I hear a sound in the wind that is like a sound of piping,\" quoth she. \"And it is for that that I dance widdershins. For the gift comes that will make you bare, and the man comes that must bring you care."}, {"size": 602, "text": "But for me the morrow is come that I have thought upon, and the hour of my power.\" \"How comes it, crone,\" said the King's daughter, \"that you waver like a rag, and pale like a dead leaf before my eyes?\" \"Because the morrow has come that I have thought upon, and the hour of my power,\" said the crone; and she fell on the beach, and, lo! she was but stalks of the sea tangle, and dust of the sea sand, and the sand lice hopped upon the place of her. \"This is the strangest thing that befell between two seas,\" said the King's daughter of Duntrine. But the nurse broke out and moaned like an autumn gale."}, {"size": 675, "text": "\"I am weary of the wind,\" quoth she; and she bewailed her day. The King's daughter was aware of a man upon the beach; he went hooded so that none might perceive his face, and a pipe was underneath his arm. The sound of his pipe was like singing wasps, and like the wind that sings in windlestraw; and it took hold upon men's ears like the crying of gulls. \"Are you the comer?\" quoth the King's daughter of Duntrine. \"I am the corner,\" said he, \"and these are the pipes that a man may hear, and I have power upon the hour, and this is the song of the morrow.\" And he piped the song of the morrow, and it was as long as years; and the nurse wept out aloud at the hearing of it."}, {"size": 613, "text": "\"This is true,\" said the King's daughter, \"that you pipe the song of the morrow; but that ye have power upon the hour, how may I know that? Show me a marvel here upon the beach, between the waves and the dead leaves.\" And the man said, \"Upon whom?\" \"Here is my nurse,\" quoth the King's daughter. \"She is weary of the wind. Show me a good marvel upon her.\" And, lo! the nurse fell upon the beach as it were two handfuls of dead leaves, and the wind whirled them widdershins, and the sand lice hopped between. \"It is true,\" said the King's daughter of Duntrine, \"you are the comer, and you have power upon the hour."}, {"size": 893, "text": "Come with me to my stone house.\" So they went by the sea margin, and the man piped the song of the morrow, and the leaves followed behind them as they went. Then they sat down together; and the sea beat on the terrace, and the gulls cried about the towers, and the wind crooned in the chimneys of the house. Nine years they sat, and every year when it fell autumn, the man said, \"This is the hour, and I have power in it\"; and the daughter of the King said, \"Nay, but pipe me the song of the morrow\". And he piped it, and it was long like years. Now when the nine years were gone, the King's daughter of Duntrine got her to her feet, like one that remembers; and she looked about her in the masoned house; and all her servants were gone; only the man that piped sat upon the terrace with the hand upon his face; and as he piped the leaves ran about the terrace and the sea beat along the wall."}, {"size": 869, "text": "Then she cried to him with a great voice, \"This is the hour, and let me see the power in it\". And with that the wind blew off the hood from the man's face, and, lo! there was no man there, only the clothes and the hood and the pipes tumbled one upon another in a corner of the terrace, and the dead leaves ran over them. And the King's daughter of Duntrine got her to that part of the beach where strange things had been done in the ancient ages; and there she sat her down. The sea foam ran to her feet, and the dead leaves swarmed about her back, and the veil blew about her face in the blowing of the wind. And when she lifted up her eyes, there was the daughter of a King come walking on the beach. Her hair was like the spun gold, and her eyes like pools in a river, and she had no thought for the morrow and no power upon the hour, after the manner of simple men."}]}
