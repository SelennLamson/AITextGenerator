   "text": "OR, HOW PHIL BRENT WON SUCCESS. By Horatio Alger, Jr., “Joe's Luck,” “Frank Fowler, the Cash Boy,” “Tom Temple's Career,” “Tom Thatcher's Fortune,” “Ragged Dick,” “Tattered Tom,” “Luck and Pluck,” etc., etc. Fred Sargent's Revenge. PHIL HAS A LITTLE DIFFICULTY. Phil Brent was plodding through the snow in the direction of the house where he lived with his step-mother and her son, when a snow-ball, moist and hard, struck him just below his ear with stinging emphasis. The pain was considerable, and Phil's anger rose. He turned suddenly, his eyes flashing fiercely, intent upon discovering who had committed this outrage, for he had no doubt that it was intentional. He looked in all directions, but saw no one except a mild old gentleman in spectacles, who appeared to have some difficulty in making his way through the obstructed street. Phil did not need to be told that it was not the old gentleman who had taken such an unwarrantable liberty with him. So he looked farther, but his ears gave him the first clew. He heard a chuckling laugh, which seemed to proceed from behind the stone wall that ran along the roadside. “I will see who it is,” he decided, and plunging through the snow he surmounted the wall, in time to see a boy of about his own age running away across the fields as fast as the deep snow would allow. “So it's you, Jonas!” he shouted wrathfully. “I thought it was some sneaking fellow like you.” Jonas Webb, his step-brother, his freckled face showing a degree of dismay, for he had not calculated on discovery, ran the faster,",

What made you throw that snowball?” demanded Phil, in a tone that showed he did not intend to be trifled with. “Because I chose to,” answered Jonas, his spite getting the better of his prudence. “Did it hurt you?” he continued, his eyes gleaming with malice. “I should think it might. It was about as hard as a cannon-ball,” returned Phil grimly. “Is that all you've got to say about it?” “I did it in fun,” said Jonas, beginning to see that he had need to be prudent. “Very well! I don't like your idea of fun. Perhaps you won't like mine,” said Phil, as he forcibly drew Jonas back till he lay upon the snow, and then kneeling by his side, rubbed his face briskly with snow. “What are you doin'? Goin' to murder me?” shrieked Jonas, in anger and dismay. “I am going to wash your face,” said Phil, continuing the operation vigorously. “I say, you quit that! I'll tell my mother,” ejaculated Jonas, struggling furiously. “If you do, tell her why I did it,” said Phil. Jonas shrieked and struggled, but in vain. Phil gave his face an effectual scrubbing, and did not desist until he thought he had avenged the bad treatment he had suffered.",

Jonas scrambled to his feet, his mean features working convulsively with anger. “You'll suffer for this!” he shouted. “You won't make me!” said Phil contemptuously. “You're the meanest boy in the village.” “I am willing to leave that to the opinion of all who know me.” “I'll tell my mother!” “Go home and tell her!” Jonas started for home, and Phil did not attempt to stop him. As he saw Jonas reach the street and plod angrily homeward, he said to himself: “I suppose I shall be in hot water for this; but I can't help it. Mrs. Brent always stands up for her precious son, who is as like her as can be. Well, it won't make matters much worse than they have been.” Phil concluded not to go home at once, but to allow a little time for the storm to spend its force after Jonas had told his story. So he delayed half an hour and then walked slowly up to the side door. He opened the door, brushed off the snow from his boots with the broom that stood behind the door, and opening the inner door, stepped into the kitchen. No one was there, as Phil's first glance satisfied him, and he was disposed to hope that Mrs. Brent--he never called her mother--was out, but a thin, acid, measured voice from the sitting-room adjoining soon satisfied him that there was to be no reprieve. “Philip Brent, come here!” Phil entered the sitting-room. In a rocking-chair by the fire sat a thin woman, with a sharp visage, cold eyes and firmly compressed lips, to whom no child would voluntarily draw near.",

Jonas, as if to emphasize these words, uttered a half groan. Philip could not help smiling, for to him it seemed ridiculous. “You laugh,” said his step-mother sharply. “I am not surprised at it. You delight in your brutality.” “I suppose you mean that I have treated Jonas brutally.” “I see you confess it.” “No, Mrs. Brent, I do not confess it. The brutality you speak of was all on the side of Jonas.” “No doubt,” retorted Mrs. Brent, with sarcasm. “It's the case of the wolf and the lamb over again.” “I don't think Jonas has represented the matter to you as it happened,” said Phil. “Did he tell you that he flung a snow-ball at my head as hard as a lump of ice?” “He said he threw a little snow at you playfully and you sprang upon him like a tiger.” “There's a little mistake in that,” said Phil. “The snow-ball was hard enough to stun me if it had hit me a little higher. I wouldn't be hit like that again for ten dollars.” “That ain't so! Don't believe him, mother!” said Jonas from the sofa.",

Phil regarded his step-brother with scorn. “Can't you tell the truth now and then, Jonas?” he asked contemptuously. “You shall not insult my boy in my presence!” said Mrs. Brent, with a little spot of color mantling her high cheek-bones. “Philip Brent, I have too long endured your insolence. You think because I am a woman you can be insolent with impunity, but you will find yourself mistaken. It is time that you understood something that may lead you to lower your tone. Learn, then, that you have not a cent of your own. You are wholly dependent upon my bounty.” “What! Did my father leave you all his money?” asked Philip. “He was NOT your father!” answered Mrs. Brent coldly.",

   "text": "A STRANGE REVELATION. Philip started in irrepressible astonishment as these words fell from the lips of his step-mother. It seemed to him as if the earth were crumbling beneath his feet, for he had felt no more certain of the existence of the universe than of his being the son of Gerald Brent. He was not the only person amazed at this declaration. Jonas, forgetting for the moment the part he was playing, sat bolt upright on the sofa, with his large mouth wide open, staring by turns at Philip and his mother. “Gosh!” he exclaimed in a tone indicating utter surprise and bewilderment. “Will you repeat that, Mrs. Brent?” asked Philip, after a brief pause, not certain that he had heard aright. “I spoke plain English, I believe,” said Mrs. Brent coldly, enjoying the effect of her communication. “I said that Mr. Brent, my late husband, was not your father.” “I don't believe you!” burst forth Philip impetuously. “You don't wish to believe me, you mean,” answered his step-mother, unmoved. “No, I don't wish to believe you,” said the boy, looking her in the eye. “You are very polite to doubt a lady's word,” said Mrs. Brent with sarcasm. “In such a matter as that I believe no one's word,” said Phil. “I ask for proof.” “Well, I am prepared to satisfy you. Sit down and I will tell you the story.” Philip sat down on the nearest chair and regarded his step-mother fixedly. “Whose son am I,” he demanded, “if not Mr.",

Jonas,” continued his mother, suddenly turning to her hulking son, on whose not very intelligent countenance there was an expression of greedy curiosity, “do you understand that what I am going to say is to be a secret, not to be spoken of to any one?” “Yes'm,” answered Jonas readily. “Very well. Now to proceed. Philip, you have heard probably that when you were very small your father--I mean Mr. Brent--lived in a small town in Ohio, called Fultonville?” “Yes, I have heard him say so.” “Do you remember in what business he was then engaged?”",

The few who stopped at his house were business men from towns near by, or drummers from the great cities, who had occasion to stay over a night. One evening, however, a gentleman arrived with an unusual companion--in other words, a boy of about three years of age. The boy had a bad cold, and seemed to need womanly care. Mr. Brent's wife----” “The woman you were taught to call mother,” corrected the second Mrs. Brent, “felt compassion for the child, and volunteered to take care of it for the night. The offer was gladly accepted, and you--for, of course, you were the child--were taken into Mrs. Brent's own room, treated with simple remedies, and in the morning seemed much better. Your father--your real father--seemed quite gratified, and preferred a request. It was that your new friend would take care of you for a week while he traveled to Cincinnati on business. After dispatching this, he promised to return and resume the care of you, paying well for the favor done him. Mrs. Brent, my predecessor, being naturally fond of children, readily agreed to this proposal, and the child was left behind, while the father started for Cincinnati.” Here Mrs. Brent paused, and Philip regarded her with doubt and suspense “Oh, you want to know the rest?” said Mrs. Brent with an ironical smile. “You are interested in the story?” “Yes, madam, whether it is true or not.” “There isn't much more to tell,” said Mrs.",

In fact, you seemed to feel quite at home among your new surroundings, which was rather unfortunate, FOR YOUR FATHER NEVER CAME BACK!” “Never came back!” repeated Philip. “No; nor was anything heard from him. Mr. and Mrs. Brent came to the conclusion that the whole thing was prearranged to get rid of you. Luckily for you, they had become attached to you, and, having no children of their own, decided to retain you. Of course, some story had to be told to satisfy the villagers. You were represented to be the son of a friend, and this was readily believed. When, however, my late husband left Ohio, and traveled some hundreds of miles eastward to this place, he dropped this explanation and represented you as his own son. Romantic, wasn't it?” Philip looked searchingly at the face of his step-mother, or the woman whom he had regarded as such, but he could read nothing to contradict the story in her calm, impassive countenance. A great fear fell upon him that she might be telling the truth. His features showed his contending emotions. But he had a profound distrust as well as dislike of his step-mother, and he could not bring himself to put confidence in what she told him. “What proof is there of this?” he asked, after a while. “Your father's word. I mean, of course, Mr. Brent's word. He told me this story before I married him, feeling that I had a right to know.” “Why didn't he tell me?” asked Philip incredulously.",

   "text": "Mrs. Brent left the room, went up-stairs, and speedily returned, bringing with her a small daguerreotype, representing a boy of three years. “Did you ever see this before?” she asked. “No,” answered Philip, taking it from her hand and eying it curiously. “When Mr. and Mrs. Brent decided that you were to be left on their hands,” she proceeded, “they had this picture of you taken in the same dress in which you came to them, with a view to establish your identity if at any time afterward inquiry should be made for you.” The daguerreotype represented a bright, handsome child, dressed tastefully, and more as would be expected of a city child than of one born in the country. There was enough resemblance to Philip as he looked now to convince him that it was really his picture. “I have something more to show you,” said Mrs. Brent. She produced a piece of white paper in which the daguerreotype had been folded. Upon it was some writing, and Philip readily recognized the hand of the man whom he had regarded as his father. “This is the picture of the boy who was mysteriously left in the charge of Mr. Brent, April, 1863, and never reclaimed. I have reared him as my own son, but think it best to enter this record of the way in which he came into my hands, and to preserve by the help of art his appearance at the time he first came to us. GERALD BRENT.” “Do you recognize this handwriting?” asked Mrs. Brent. “Yes,” answered Philip in a dazed tone. “Perhaps,” she said triumphantly, “you will doubt my word now.” “May I have this picture?” asked Philip, without answering her. “Yes; you have as good a claim to it as any one.”",

I guess he won't be quite so uppish after this.” PHIL'S SUDDEN RESOLUTION. When Phil left the presence of Mrs. Brent, he felt as if he had been suddenly transported to a new world. He was no longer Philip Brent, and the worst of it was that he did not know who he was. In his tumultuous state of feeling, however, one thing seemed clear--his prospects were wholly changed, and his plans for the future also. Mrs. Brent had told him that he was wholly dependent upon her. Well, he did not intend to remain so. His home had not been pleasant at the best. As a dependent upon the bounty of such a woman it would be worse. He resolved to leave home and strike out for himself, not from any such foolish idea of independence as sometimes leads boys to desert a good home for an uncertain skirmish with the world, but simply be cause he felt now that he had no real home. To begin with he would need money, and on opening his pocket-book he ascertained that his available funds consisted of only a dollar and thirty-seven cents. That wasn't quite enough to begin the world with.",

On the village street he met Reuben Gordon, a young journeyman carpenter, who was earning good wages, and had money to spare. “How are you, Phil,” said Reuben in a friendly way. “You are just the one I want to meet,” said Phil earnestly. “Didn't you tell me once you would like to buy my gun?” “Yes. Want to sell it?” “No, I don't; but I want the money it will bring. So I'll sell it if you'll buy.” “What d'ye want for it?” asked Reuben cautiously.",

Do you know of any one who wants to buy a boat?” “What? Going to sell that, too?” “Seems to me you're closin' up business?” said Reuben shrewdly. “So I am. I'm going to leave Planktown.” “You don't say? Well, I declare! Where are you goin'?” “To New York, I guess.” “Got any prospect there?” This was not, perhaps, strictly true--that is, Phil had no definite prospect, but he felt that there must be a chance in a large city like New York for any one who was willing to work, and so felt measurably justified in saying what he did. “I hadn't thought of buyin' a boat,” said Reuben thoughtfully. Phil pricked up his ears at the hint of a possible customer. “You'd better buy mine,” he said quickly; “I'll sell it cheap.” “It cost me fifteen.” “But it's second-hand now, you know,” said Reuben. “It's just as good as new. I'm taking off five dollars, though, you see.” “I don't think I want it enough to pay ten dollars.” “What will you give?” Reuben finally agreed to pay seven dollars and seventy-five cents, after more or less bargaining, and to pay the money that evening upon delivery of the goods. “I don't think I've got anything more to sell,” said Phil thoughtfully. “There's my skates, but they are not very good.",

He can't afford to buy a pair.” Tommy was the son of a poor widow, and was very much pleased with the gift, which Phil conveyed to him just before supper. Just after supper he took his gun and the key of his boat over to Reuben Gordon, who thereupon gave him the money agreed upon. “Shall I tell Mrs. Brent I am going away?” Phil said to himself, “or shall I leave a note for her?” He decided to announce his resolve in person. To do otherwise would seem too much like running away, and that he had too much self-respect to do. So in the evening, after his return from Reuben Gordon's, he said to Mrs. Brent: “I think I ought to tell you that I'm going away to-morrow.” Mrs. Brent looked up from her work, and her cold gray eyes surveyed Phil with curious scrutiny. “You are going away!” she replied. “Where are you going?” “I think I shall go to New York.”",

I prefer to earn my own living.” “I am not prepared to say but that you are right. But do you know what the neighbors will say?” “What will they say?” “That I drove you from home.” “It won't be true. I don't pretend to enjoy my home, but I suppose I can stay on here if I like?” “You don't object to my going?” “No, if it is understood that you go of your own accord.” “I am willing enough to take the blame of it, if there is any blame.” “Very well; get a sheet of note-paper, and write at my direction.” Phil took a sheet of note-paper from his father's desk, and sat down to comply with Mrs. Brent's request. She dictated as follows: “I leave home at my own wish, but with the consent of Mrs. Brent, to seek my fortune. It is wholly my own idea, and I hold no one else responsible. “You may as well keep the name of Brent,” said his step-mother, “as you have no other that you know of.” Phil winced at those cold words. It was not pleasant to reflect that this was so, and that he was wholly ignorant of his parentage.",

I shall not forget it.” That evening, just before going to bed, Mrs. Brent opened a trunk and drew from it a folded paper. She read as follows--for it was her husband's will: “To the boy generally known as Philip Brent, and supposed, though incorrectly, to be my son, I bequeath the sum of five thousand dollars, and direct the same to be paid over to any one whom he may select as guardian, to hold in trust for him till he attains the age of twenty-one.” “He need never know of this,” said Mrs. Brent to herself in a low tone. “I will save it for Jonas.” She held the paper a moment, as if undecided whether to destroy it, but finally put it carefully back in the secret hiding-place from which she had taken it. “He is leaving home of his own accord,” she whispered. “Henceforth he will probably keep away.

As for Jonas, he was cautioned by his mother not to get himself into trouble by treating Phil badly, and the boy, who knew on which side his interests lay, faithfully obeyed. It was only after the death of Mr. Brent that both Jonas and his mother changed their course, and thought it safe to snub Philip. Planktown was seventy-five miles distant from New York, and the fare was two dollars and a quarter. This was rather a large sum to pay, considering Phil's scanty fund, but he wished to get to the great city as soon as possible, and he decided that it would be actually cheaper to ride than to walk, considering that he would have to buy his meals on the way. He took his seat in the cars, placing a valise full of underclothes on the seat next him. The train was not very full, and the seat beside him did not appear to be required. Mile after mile they sped on the way, and Phil looked from the window with interest at the towns through which they passed. There are very few boys of his age--sixteen--who do not like to travel in the cars.",

Presently--perhaps half way on--a young man, rather stylishly dressed, came into the car. It was not at a station, and therefore it seemed clear that he came from another car. He halted when he reached the seat which Phil occupied. Our hero, observing that his glance rested on his valise, politely removed it, saying: “Would you like to sit down here, sir?” “Yes, thank you,” answered the young man, and sank into the seat beside Phil. “Sorry to inconvenience you,” he said, with a glance at the bag. “Oh, not at all,” returned Phil. “I only put the valise on the seat till it was wanted by some passenger.” “You are more considerate than some passengers,” observed the young man. “In the next car is a woman, an elderly party, who is taking up three extra seats to accommodate her bags and boxes.” “That seems rather selfish,” remarked Phil. “Selfish! I should say so. I paused a minute at her seat as I passed along, and she was terribly afraid I wanted to sit down. She didn't offer to move anything, though, as you have. I stopped long enough to make her feel uncomfortable, and then passed on. I don't think I have fared any the worse for doing so. I would rather sit beside you than her.” “Am I to consider that a compliment?” asked Phil, smiling. “Well, yes, if you choose. Not that it is saying much to call you more agreeable company than the old party alluded to. Are you going to New York?”",

However, you are, no doubt, able to pay your board for awhile.” “For a short time,” said Phil. “Well, I may be able to help you to a place. I know a good many prominent business men.” “I should be grateful to you for any help of that kind,” said Phil, deciding that he was in luck to meet with such a friend. “Don't mention it. I have had to struggle myself--in earlier days--though at present I am well fixed. What is your name?” “Good! My name is Lionel Lake. Sorry I haven't got any cards. Perhaps I may have one in my pocket-book. Let me see!” Mr. Lake opened his porte-monnaie and uttered a exclamation of surprise. “By Jove!” he said, “I am in a fix.” Phil looked at him inquiringly.",

The trouble is that I am left temporarily without funds.” “But you can get money in the city,” suggested Phil. “No doubt; only it is necessary for me to stay over a train ten miles short of the city.” Mr. Lionel Lake seemed very much perplexed. “If I knew some one in the cars,” he said reflectively. It did occur to Phil to offer to loan him something, but the scantiness of his own resources warned him that it would not be prudent, so he remained silent. Finally Mr. Lake appeared to have an idea. “Have you got five dollars, Philip?” he said familiarly. “Yes, sir,” answered Philip slowly. “Then I'll make a proposal. Lend it to me and I will give you this ring as security. It is worth twenty-five dollars easily.” He drew from his vest-pocket a neat gold ring, with some sort of a stone in the setting. “There!” said Mr. Lake, “I'll give you this ring and my address, and you can bring it to my office to-morrow morning. I'll give you back the five dollars and one dollar for the accommodation. That's good interest, isn't it?” “But I might keep the ring and sell it,” suggested Phil. “Oh, I am not afraid. You look honest. I will trust you,” said the young man, in a careless, off-hand manner. “Say, is it a bargain?” “Yes,” answered Phil. It occurred to him that he could not earn a dollar more easily. Besides, he would be doing a favor to this very polite young man.",

He also handed Phil a scrap of paper, on which he penciled: “LIONEL LAKE, No. 237 Broadway.” “I'm ever so much obliged,” he said. “Good-by. I get out at the next station.” Phil was congratulating himself on his good stroke of business, when the conductor entered the car, followed by a young lady. When they came to where Phil was seated, the young lady said: “That is my ring on that boy's finger?” “Aha! we've found the thief, then!” said the conductor. “Boy, give up the ring you stole from this young lady!” As he spoke he placed his hand on Phil's shoulder. “Stole!” repeated Phil, gasping. “I don't understand you.” “Oh, yes, you do!” said the conductor roughly. AN OVERBEARING CONDUCTOR No matter how honest a boy may be, a sudden charge of theft is likely to make him look confused and guilty. Such was the case with Phil. “I assure you,” he said earnestly, “that I did not steal this ring.” “Where did you get it, then?” demanded the conductor roughly. He was one of those men who, in any position, will make themselves disagreeable. Moreover, he was a man who always thought ill of others, when there was any chance of doing so. In fact, he preferred to credit his fellows with bad qualities rather than with good. “It was handed me by a young man who just left the car,” said Phil.",

I shall hand you over to a policeman as soon as we reach New York.” Phil was certainly dismayed, for he felt that it might be difficult for him to prove that he came honestly in possession of the ring. “The fact is,” added the conductor, “your story is too thin.” “Conductor,” said a new voice, “you are doing the boy an injustice.” The speaker was an old man with gray hair, but of form still robust, though he was at least sixty five. He sat in the seat just behind Phil. “Thank you, sir,” said Phil gratefully. “I understand my business,” said the conductor impertinently, “and don't need any instructions from you.” “Young man,” said the old gentleman, in a very dignified tone, “I have usually found officials of your class polite and gentlemanly, but you are an exception.” “Who are you?” asked the conductor rudely.",

As he left the depot and found himself in the streets of New York, he felt like a stranger upon the threshold of a new life. He knew almost nothing about the great city he had entered, and was at a loss where to seek for lodgings. “It's a cold day,” said a sociable voice at his elbow. Looking around, Phil saw that the speaker was a sallow-complexioned young man, with black hair and mustache, a loose black felt hat, crushed at the crown, giving him rather a rakish look. “Yes, sir,” answered Phil politely. “Stranger in the city, I expect?” “Never mind the sir. I ain't used to ceremony. I am Signor Orlando.” “Signor Orlando!” repeated Phil, rather puzzled. “Are you an Italian?” “Well, yes,” returned Signor Orlando, with a wink, “that's what I am, or what people think me; but I was born in Vermont, and am half Irish and half Yankee.” “How did you come by your name, then?” “I took it,” answered his companion. “You see, dear boy, I'm a professional.” “A professional--singer and clog-dancer. I believe I am pretty well known to the public,” continued Signor Orlando complacently. “Last summer I traveled with Jenks & Brown's circus. Of course you've heard of THEM.

He had never met an actor, or public performer of any description, and was disposed to have a high respect for a man who filled such a conspicuous position. There was not, to be sure, anything very impressive about Signor Orlando's appearance. His face did not indicate talent, and his dress was shabby. But for all that he was a man familiar with the public--a man of gifts. “I should like to see you on the stage,” said Phil respectfully. “So you shall, my dear boy--so you shall. I'll get you a pass from Mr. Bowerman. Which way are you going?” “I don't know,” answered Phil, puzzled. “I should like to find a cheap boarding-house, but I don't know the city.” “I do,” answered Signor Orlando promptly. “Why not come to my house?”",

Suppose we take a horse-car?” “All right!” answered Phil, relieved to find a guide in the labyrinth of the great city. “I live on Fifth Street, near the Bowery--a very convenient location,” said Orlando, if we may take the liberty to call him thus. “Fifth Avenue?” asked Phil, who did not know the difference. “Oh, no; that's a peg above my style. I am not a Vanderbilt, nor yet an Astor.” “Is the price moderate?” asked Phil anxiously. “I must make my money last as long as I can, for I don't know when I shall get a place.” “To be sure. You might room with me, only I've got a hall bedroom. Perhaps we might manage it, though.” “I think I should prefer a room by myself,” said Phil, who reflected that Signor Orlando was a stranger as yet. “Oh, well, I'll speak to the old lady, and I guess she can accommodate you with a hall bedroom like mine on the third floor.” “What should I have to pay?” “A dollar and a quarter a week, and you can get your meals where you please.” “I think that will suit me,” said Phil thoughtfully. After leaving the car, a minute's walk brought them to a shabby three-story house of brick. There was a stable opposite, and a group of dirty children were playing in front of it. “This is where I hang out,” said Signor Orlando cheerfully. “As the poet says, there is no place like home.” If this had been true it was not much to be regretted, since the home in question was far from attractive.",

She threw open the door of a back room, which, being lower than the hall, was reached by a step. “There!” said she, pointing to the faded carpet, rumpled bed, and cheap pine bureau, with the little six-by-ten looking-glass surmounting it. “This is a peautiful room for a single gentleman, or even for a man and his wife.” “My friend, Mr. Brent, is not married,” said Signor Orlando waggishly. “You will have your shoke, Signor Orlando,” said Mrs. Schlessinger. “What is the price of this room?” asked Phil. “Three dollars a week, Mr. Prent, I ought to have four, but since you are a steady young gentleman----” “How does she know that?” Phil wondered. “Since you are a steady young gentleman, and a friend of Signor Orlando, I will not ask you full price.” “That is more than I can afford to pay,” said Phil, shaking his head.",

On the whole, they did not appear to belong to the highest social rank, though they were doubtless respectable. The table-cloths were generally soiled, and the waiters had a greasy look. Phil said nothing, but he did not feel quite so hungry as before he entered. The signor found two places at one of the tables, and they sat down. Phil examined a greasy bill of fare and found that he could obtain a plate of meat for ten cents. This included bread and butter, and a dish of mashed potato. A cup of tea would be five cents additional. “I can afford fifteen cents for a meal,” he thought, and called for a plate of roast beef. “Corn beef and cabbage for me,” said the signor. “It's very filling,” he remarked aside to Phil. “They won't give you but a mouthful of beef.” So it proved, but the quality was such that Phil did not care for more. He ordered a piece of apple pie afterward feeling still hungry. “I see you're bound to have a square meal,” said the signor. After Phil had had it, he was bound to confess that he did not feel uncomfortably full. Yet he had spent twice as much as the signor, who dispensed with the tea and pie as superfluous luxuries.

Bowerman always gives the public their money's worth. The performance begins at eight o'clock and won't be out until half-past eleven.” “Less than five cents an hour,” commented Phil. “What a splendid head you've got!” said Signor Orlando admiringly. “I couldn't have worked that up. Figures ain't my province.” It seemed to Phil rather a slender cause for compliment, but he said nothing, since it seemed clear that the computation was beyond his companion's ability. As to the performance, it was not refined, nor was the talent employed first-class. Still Phil enjoyed himself after a fashion. He had never had it in his power to attend many amusements, and this was new to him. He naturally looked with interest for the appearance of his new friend and fellow-lodger. Signor Orlando appeared, dressed in gorgeous array, sang a song which did credit to the loudness of his voice rather than its quality, and ended by a noisy clog-dance which elicited much applause from the boys in the gallery, who shared the evening's entertainment for the moderate sum of ten cents.

He had, by the way, mentioned that his name was Oliver Carter, and that he was no longer actively engaged in business, but was a silent partner in the firm of which his nephew by marriage was the nominal head. “Thank you, sir,” answered Phil. He was sure that the invitation was intended to be accepted, and he saw no reason why he should not accept it. “Hannah,” said the old gentleman to the servant who opened the door, “tell your mistress that I have brought a boy home to dinner with me.” “Yes, sir,” answered Hannah, surveying Phil in some surprise. “Come up to my room, my young friend,” said Mr. Carter. “You may want to prepare for lunch.” Mr. Carter had two connecting rooms on the second floor, one of which he used as a bed-chamber. The furniture was handsome and costly, and Phil, who was not used to city houses, thought it luxurious. Phil washed his face and hands, and brushed his hair. Then a bell rang, and following his new friend, he went down to lunch. Lunch was set out in the front basement. When Phil and Mr. Carter entered the room a lady was standing by the fire, and beside her was a boy of about Phil's age. The lady was tall and slender, with light-brown hair and cold gray eyes. “Lavinia,” said Mr. Carter, “I have brought a young friend with me to lunch.” “So I see,” answered the lady. “Has he been here before?” “No; he is a new acquaintance.” “I would speak to him if I knew his name.”",

Fifth Street was not a fashionable street--indeed quite the reverse, and Phil's answer showed that he was a nobody. Phil himself had begun to suspect that he was unfashionably located, but he felt that until his circumstances improved he might as well remain where he was. But, though he lived in an unfashionable street, it could not be said that Phil, in his table manners, showed any lack of good breeding. He seemed quite at home at Mrs. Pitkin's table, and in fact acted with greater propriety than Alonzo, who was addicted to fast eating and greediness. “Couldn't you walk home alone, Uncle Oliver?” asked Mrs. Pitkin presently.",

I was looking for a place this morning.” “Have you lived for some time in the city?” “No; I came here only yesterday from the country.” “I think country boys are very foolish to leave good homes in the country to seek places in the city,” said Mrs. Pitkin sharply. “There may be circumstances, Lavinia, that make it advisable,” suggested Mr. Carter, who, however, did not know Phil's reason for coming. “No doubt; I understand that,” answered Mrs. Pitkin, in a tone so significant that Phil wondered whether she thought he had got into any trouble at home. “And besides, we can't judge for every one. So I hope Master Philip may find some good and satisfactory opening, now that he has reached the city.” After a short time, lunch, which in New York is generally a plain meal, was over, and Mr. Carter invited Philip to come up-stairs again. “I want to talk over your prospects, Philip,” he said. There was silence till after the two had left the room.",

The old gentleman sat down in an arm-chair and waved his hand toward a small rocking-chair, in which Phil seated himself. “I conclude that you had a good reason for leaving home, Philip,” said Mr. Carter, eying our hero with a keen, but friendly look. “Yes, sir; since my father's death it has not been a home to me.” “Is there a step-mother in the case?” asked the old gentleman shrewdly. “And you two don't agree?” “You seem to know all about it, sir,” said Phil, surprised. “I know something of the world--that is all.” Phil began to think that Mr. Carter's knowledge of the world was very remarkable. He began to wonder whether he could know anything more--could suspect the secret which Mrs. Brent had communicated to him. Should he speak of it? He decided at any rate to wait, for Mr. Carter, though kind, was a comparative stranger. “Well,” continued the old gentleman, “I won't inquire too minutely into the circumstances. You don't look like a boy that would take such an important step as leaving home without a satisfactory reason. The next thing is to help you.” Phil's courage rose as he heard these words. Mr. Carter was evidently a rich man, and he could help him if he was willing. So he kept silence, and let his new friend do the talking. “You want a place,” continued Mr. Carter. “Now, what are you fit for?” “That is a hard question for me to answer, sir.",

Then he announced the result. “Let me look at the paper.

PHIL paused before an imposing business structure, and looked up to see if he could see the sign that would show him he had reached his destination. He had not far to look. On the front of the building he saw in large letters the sign: In the door-way there was another sign, from which he learned that the firm occupied the second floor. He went up-stairs, and opening a door, entered a spacious apartment which looked like a hive of industry. There were numerous clerks, counters piled with goods, and every indication that a prosperous business was being carried on. The nearest person was a young man of eighteen, or perhaps more, with an incipient, straw-colored mustache, and a shock of hair of tow-color. This young man wore a variegated neck-tie, a stiff standing-collar, and a suit of clothes in the extreme of fashion. Phil looked at him hesitatingly. The young man observed the look, and asked condescendingly: “What can I do for you, my son?” Such an address from a person less than three years older than himself came near upsetting the gravity of Phil. “Is Mr. Pitkin in?” he asked. “I have no objection,” remarked the young man facetiously. “Where shall I find him?” The youth indicated a small room partitioned off as a private office in the extreme end of the store.",

You can send him to the post-office, and to other offices on such errands as you may have. Pay him five dollars a week and charge that sum to me. Yours truly, OLIVER CARTER. Mr. Pitkin's frown deepened as he read this note. “Pish!” he ejaculated, in a tone which, though low, was audible to Phil. “Uncle Oliver must be crazy. What is your name?” he demanded fiercely, turning suddenly to Phil. “When did you meet--the gentleman who gave you this letter?” “Do you know what is in this letter?” “I suppose, sir, it is a request that you give me a place.” “No,” answered Phil indignantly. “Humph!

PHIL ENTERS UPON HIS DUTIES. Phil presented himself in good season the next morning at the store in Franklin Street. As he came up in one direction the youth whom he had seen in the store the previous day came up in the opposite direction.

As Phil didn't know that this form of expression, slightly varied, had become a popular phrase of the day, he did not laugh. “Do you belong to the church?” asked the youth, stopping short in his own mirth. “What makes you ask?” “Because you don't laugh.” “I would if I saw anything to laugh at.” “Come, that's hard on me. Honor bright, have you come to do any business with us?” It is rather amusing to see how soon the cheapest clerk talks of “us,” quietly identifying himself with the firm that employs him. Not that I object to it. Often it implies a personal interest in the success and prosperity of the firm, which makes a clerk more valuable. This was not, however, the case with G.

At that time the post-office was on Nassau Street, in an old church which had been utilized for a purpose very different from the one to which it had originally been devoted.

It was plain enough, but there was an air of neatness which did not characterize his present room. “I like the room,” he said, brightening up. “How much do you charge for this room and board?” “Four dollars. That includes breakfast and supper,” answered Mrs. Forbush. “Lunch you provide for yourself.” “That will be satisfactory,” said Phil. “I am in a place down town, and I could not come to lunch, at any rate.” “When would you like to come, Mr.----?” said the widow interrogatively. “My name is Philip Brent.” “I will come some time to-morrow.” “Generally I ask a small payment in advance, as a guarantee that an applicant will really come, but I am sure I can trust you.” “Thank you, but I am quite willing to conform to your usual rule,” said Phil, as he drew a two-dollar bill from his pocket and handed it to the widow.",

Phil's week at his present lodging would not be up for several days, but he was tired of it, and felt that he would be much more comfortable with Mrs. Forbush. So he was ready to make the small pecuniary sacrifice needful. The conversation which has been recorded took but five minutes, and did not materially delay Phil, who, as I have already said, was absent from the store on an errand. The next day Phil became installed at his new boarding-place, and presented himself at supper. There were three other boarders, two being a young salesman at a Third Avenue store and his wife. They occupied a square room on the same floor with Phil. The other was a female teacher, employed in one of the city public schools. The only remaining room was occupied by a drummer, who was often called away for several days together. This comprised the list of boarders, but Phil's attention was called to a young girl of fourteen, of sweet and attractive appearance, whom he ascertained to be a daughter of Mrs. Forbush. The young lady herself, Julia Forbush, cast frequent glances at Phil, who, being an unusually good-looking boy, would naturally excite the notice of a young girl. On the whole, it seemed a pleasant and social circle, and Phil felt that he had found a home. The next day, as he was occupied in the store, next to G. Washington Wilbur, he heard that young man say: “Why, there's Mr.",

I shall be entirely willing to introduce you when there is a good chance.” This seemed to appease Mr. Wilbur, who became once more gracious. “Philip,” he said, as the hour of closing approached, “why can't you come around and call upon me this evening?” “So I will,” answered Phil readily. Indeed, he found it rather hard to fill up his evenings, and was glad to have a way suggested. “Do. I want to tell you a secret.” “Where do you live?” asked Phil. “No.---- East Twenty-second Street.” “All right. I will come round about half-past seven.” Though Wilbur lived in a larger house than he, Phil did not like his room as well. There being only one chair in the room, Mr. Wilbur put his visitor in it, and himself sat on the bed. There was something of a mystery in the young man's manner as, after clearing his throat, he said to Phil: “I am going to tell you a secret.” Phil's curiosity was somewhat stirred, and he signified that he would like to hear it.",

They had reached Twenty-eighth Street, when the door of house farther up on the avenue was opened and a lady came out. “That's she!” ejaculated Mr. Wilbur, clutching Phil by the arm. Phil looked, and saw a tall young lady, three or four inches taller than his friend and as many years older. He looked at his companion with surprise. “Is that the young lady you are in love with?” he asked. “Yes; isn't she a daisy?” asked the lover fervently. “I am not much of a judge of daisies,” answered Phil, a little embarrassed, for the young lady had large features, and was, in his eyes, very far from pretty.

Phil coughed. It was all that saved him from laughing. While he was struggling with the inclination, the lady inadvertently dropped a small parcel which she had been carrying in her hand. The two boys were close behind. Like an arrow from the bow Mr. Wilbur sprang forward, picked up the parcel, and while his heart beat wildly, said, as he tendered it to the owner, with a graceful bow and captivating smile: “Miss, I believe you dropped this.” “Thank you, my good boy,” answered the daisy pleasantly. Mr. Wilbur staggered back as if he had been struck. He fell back in discomfiture, and his face showed the mortification and anguish he felt. “Did you hear what she said?” he asked, in a hollow voice. “She called you a boy, didn't she?” “Yes,” answered Mr. Wilbur sadly. “Perhaps she may be near-sighted,” said Phil consolingly. “Do you think so?” asked Mr. Wilbur hopefully. “It is quite possible.

As you say, I am small, and a near-sighted person might easily suppose me to be younger than I am. Now, with a stove-pipe hat I shall look much older.” “Then I can make her acquaintance again, and she will not mistake me.

They always do when a man marries. Besides, I have other resources.” “Yes; I am worth two thousand dollars. It was left me by an aunt, and is kept in trust for me until I am twenty-one.

As time passed on, Phil and Wilbur spent considerable time together out of the store. Mr. G. Washington Wilbur, apart from his amusing traits, was a youth of good principles and good disposition, and Phil was glad of his company. Sometimes they went to cheap amusements, but not often, for neither had money to spare for such purposes. Some weeks after Phil's entrance upon his duties Mr. Wilbur made a proposal to Phil of a startling nature. “Suppose we have our fortunes told, Phil?” he said. “If it would help my fortune, or hurry it up, I shouldn't object,” said Phil, smiling. “I want to know what fate has in store for me,” said Wilbur. “Do you think the fortune-tellers know any better than you do?” asked Phil incredulously. “They tell some strange things,” said Wilbur. “What, for instance?” “An aunt of mine went to a fortune-teller and asked if she would ever be married, and when? She was told that she would be married before she was twenty-two, to a tall, light-complexioned man.”",

There was a certain “Veiled Lady,” who advertised her qualifications in the Herald, as the seventh daughter of a seventh daughter, and therefore gifted with the power to read the future. Mr. Wilbur made choice of her, and together they went to call upon her one evening. They were shown into an anteroom, and in due time Mr. Wilbur was called into the dread presence. He was somewhat nervous and agitated, but “braced up,” as he afterward expressed it, and went in. He wanted Phil to go in with him, but the attendant said that madam would not allow it, and he went forward alone. Fifteen minutes afterward he re-entered the room with a radiant face. “Have you heard good news?” asked Phil. Mr. Wilbur nodded emphatically and whispered, for there were two others in waiting: “It's all right. I am to marry her.” “Did the fortune-teller say so?” “Did she give her name?” “No, but she described her so that I knew her at once.” “Will it be soon?” asked Phil slyly.",

Phil entered the inner room, and looked about him in curiosity. A tall woman sat upon a sort of throne, with one hand resting on a table beside her. A tall wax-taper supplied the place of the light of day, which was studiously excluded from the room by thick, dark curtains. Over the woman's face was a black veil, which gave her an air of mystery. “Come hither, boy!” she said, in a clear, commanding voice. Phil advanced, not wholly unimpressed, though he felt skeptical. The woman bent forward, starting slightly and scanned his face eagerly.",

You left without regret, and those whom you have left behind do not miss you.” Phil started in amazement. This was certainly true. “Shall I find the fortune I seek?” asked our hero earnestly. “Yes, but not in the way you expect. You think yourself alone in the world!” The fortune-teller paused, and looked searchingly at the boy. “So I am,” returned Phil. “No boy who has a father living can consider himself alone.” “My father is dead!” returned Phil, growing skeptical. “I am not likely to be mistaken in such a matter. My father died a few months since.” “Your father still lives!” said the fortune-teller sharply. “Do not contradict me!” “I don't see how you can say that. I attended his funeral.” “You attended the funeral of the man whose name you bear. He was not your father.” Phil was much excited by this confirmation of his step-mother's story. He had entertained serious doubts of its being true, thinking it might have been trumped up by Mrs. Brent to drive him from home, and interfere with his succession to any part of Mr. Brent's property. “Is my step-mother's story true, then?” he asked breathlessly. “She told me I was not the son of Mr.",

Yet the next morning I left him under the charge of yourself and your husband, and pursued my journey. From that day to this I have not seen the boy, nor have I written to you or Mr. Brent. This seems strange, does it not? It requires an explanation, and that explanation I am ready to give. “To be brief, then, I was fleeing from undeserved suspicion. Circumstances which I need not detail had connected my name with the mysterious disappearance of a near friend, and the fact that a trifling dispute between us had taken place in the presence of witnesses had strengthened their suspicions.",

He picked up and handed to his mother a check on a Philadelphia bank for the sum of one hundred dollars. “Why, that's the same as money, isn't it?” asked Jonas. “Then you'll keep your promise, won't you?” Mrs. Brent silently drew from her pocket-book a two-dollar bill and handed it to Jonas. “Jonas,” she said, “if you won't breathe a word of it, I will tell you a secret.” “We start for Philadelphia to-morrow.” “By gosh! that's jolly,” exclaimed Jonas, overjoyed. “I'll keep mum. What was in the letter, mother?” “I will not tell you just now. You shall know very soon.” Mrs. Brent did not sleep much that night. Her mind was intent upon a daring scheme of imposture. Mr. Granville was immensely wealthy, no doubt. Why should she not pass off Jonas upon him as his son Philip, and thus secure a fortune for her own child? JONAS JOINS THE CONSPIRACY. Later in the evening Mrs. Brent took Jonas into her confidence. She was a silent, secretive woman by nature, and could her plan have been carried out without imparting it to any one, she would gladly have had it so. But Jonas must be her active accomplice, and it was as well to let him know at once what he must do. In the evening, when Jonas, tired with his day's skating, was lying on the lounge, Mrs. Brent rose deliberately from her seat, peeped into the adjoining room, then went to each window to make sure there was no eavesdropper, then resumed her seat and said: “Jonas, get up.",

Get a chair and draw it close to mine.” Jonas rose, his curiosity stimulated by his mother's words and manner. “Is it about the letter, mother?” he asked. “Yes, it relates to the letter and our journey to-morrow.” Jonas had wondered what the letter was about and who had sent his mother the hundred-dollar check, and he made no further objection. He drew a chair in front of his mother and said: “Go ahead, mother, I'm listening.” “Would you like to be rich, Jonas?” asked Mrs. Brent.",

Yes, I remember it.” “And about his true father having disappeared?” “Jonas, the letter I received this afternoon was from Philip's real father.” “By gosh!” ejaculated Jonas, altering his usual expression of surprise. “He is in Philadelphia. He is a very rich man.” “Then Phil will be rich,” said Jonas, disappointed. “I thought you said it would be me.” “Philip's father has never seen him since he was three years old,” continued Mrs. Brent, taking no notice of her son's tone. “What difference does that make, mother?” “Jonas,” said Mrs. Brent, bending toward her son, “if I choose to tell him that you are Philip, he won't know the difference. Do you understand?” Jonas did understand. “That's a bully idea, mother! Can we pull the wool over the old man's eyes, do you think?” “I wish you would not use such expressions, Jonas. They are not gentlemanly, and you are to be a young gentleman.” “We can manage it if you are very careful.",

She was outwardly cold, but such affection as she was capable of she expended on this graceless and ungrateful boy. “You seem to forget that I may have some feeling in the matter,” said Mrs. Brent coldly, but with inward pain. “If the result of this plan were to be that we should be permanently separated, I would never consent to it.” “Just as you like, mother,” said Jonas, with an ill grace. “I don't look much like Phil.” “No, there will be a difficulty. Still Mr. Granville has never seen Philip since he was three years old, and that is in our favor. He thinks I am Mr. Brent's first wife.” “Shall you tell him?” “I don't know. I will be guided by circumstances. Perhaps it may be best.

   "text": "THE CONSPIRACY SUCCEEDS. In a handsome private parlor at the Continental Hotel a man of about forty-five years of age sat in an easy-chair. He was of middle height, rather dark complexion, and a pleasant expression. His right foot was bandaged, and rested on a chair. The morning Daily Ledger was in his hand, but he was not reading. His mind, judging from his absorbed look, was occupied with other thoughts. “I can hardly realize,” he said half-aloud, “that my boy will so soon be restored to my arms. We have been separated by a cruel fate, but we shall soon be together again. I remember how the dear child looked when I left him at Fultonville in the care of the kind inn-keeper. I am sorry he is dead, but his widow shall be suitably repaid for her kind devotion.” He had reached this point when a knock was heard at the door. “Come in!” said Mr. Granville. A servant of the hotel appeared. “A lady and a boy are in the parlor below, sir. They wish to see you.” Though Mr. Granville had considerable control over his feelings, his heart beat fast when he heard these words. “Will you show them up at once?” he said, in a tone which showed some trace of agitation. The servant bore the message to Mrs. Brent and Jonas, who were sitting in the hotel parlor. If Mr. Granville was agitated, the two conspirators were not wholly at their ease. There was a red spot on each of Mrs. Brent's cheeks--her way of expressing emotion--and Jonas was fidgeting about uneasily in his chair, staring about him curiously.",

Everything depends on first impressions.” “I wish it was all over; I wish I was out of it,” said Jonas, wiping the perspiration from his face. “Suppose he suspects?” “He won't if you do as I tell you. Don't look gawky, but act naturally.” Just then the servant reappeared. “You are to come up-stairs,” he said. “The gentleman will see you.” “Thank you,” said Mrs. Brent, rising. “Come.” Jonas rose, and with the manner of a cur that expected a whipping, followed his mother and the servant. “It's only one flight,” said the servant, “but we can take the elevator.” “It is of no consequence,” Mrs. Brent began, but Jonas said eagerly: “Let's ride on the elevator, ma!” “Very well, Philip,” said Mrs. Brent. A minute later the two stood at the door of Mr. Granville's room. Next they stood in his presence. Mr. Granville, looking eagerly toward the door, passed over Mrs. Brent, and his glance rested on the boy who followed her. He started, and there was a quick feeling of disappointment. He had been picturing to himself how his lost boy would look, but none of his visions resembled the awkward-looking boy who stood sheepishly by the side of Mrs. Brent. “Mr. Granville, I presume,” said the lady. “Yes, madam. You are----” “Mrs. Brent, and this,” pointing to Jonas, “is the boy you left at Fultonville thirteen years ago.",

She was occupying a seat in a Chestnut Street car, while Jonas stood in front with the driver, when a gentleman whom she had not observed, sitting at the other end of the car, espied her. “Why, Mrs. Brent, how came you here?” he asked, in surprise, crossing over and taking a seat beside her.

She hoped that Mr. Pearson would not discover that Jonas was with her, as she feared that the boy might betray them unconsciously. “Do you stay long in Philadelphia?” “No, I think not,” answered Mrs. Brent. “I go back to New York this afternoon, or I would ask permission to call on you.” Mrs. Brent breathed more freely. A call at the hotel was by all means to be avoided. “Of course I should have been glad to see you,” she answered, feeling quite safe in saying so. “Are you going far?” “I get out at Thirteenth Street.” “Thank Heaven!” said Mrs. Brent to herself. “Then he won't discover where we are.” The Continental Hotel is situated at the corner of Chestnut and Ninth Streets, and Mrs. Brent feared that Jonas would stop the car at that point.

To begin with, Philip did not look at all as he had supposed his son would look. He did not look like the Granvilles at all. Indeed, he had an unusually countrified aspect, and his conversation was mingled with rustic phrases which shocked his father's taste. “I suppose it comes of the way in which he has been brought up and the country boys he has associated with,” thought Mr. Granville. “Fortunately he is young, and there is time to polish him.

He gave very little thought to the prediction of the fortune-teller whom he had consulted, and didn't dream of any short-cut to fortune. Do all he could, he found he could not live on his wages. His board cost him four dollars a week, and washing and lunch two dollars more, thus compelling him to exceed his salary by a dollar each week. He had, as we know, a reserve fund, on which he could draw, but it was small, and grew constantly smaller. Then, again, his clothes were wearing out, and he saw no way of obtaining money to buy new. Phil became uneasy, and the question came up to his mind, “Should he write to his step-mother and ask her for a trifling loan?” If the money had been hers, he would not have done so on any condition; but she had had nothing of her own, and all the property in her hands came through Mr. Brent, who, as he knew, was attached to him, even though no tie of blood united them.

They cleared out three weeks ago, and nobody's heard a word of them since--that is, nobody in the village.” “Don't you know where they've gone?” asked Phil, in amazement. “No. I was goin' to ask you.

He has brought his wife and one child with him, and it seems they're goin' to live there. Somebody asked him where his sister and Jonas were, but they didn't get no satisfaction. He said he didn't rightly know himself. He believed they was travelin'; thought they might be in Canada.” Phil looked and felt decidedly sober at this information.",

When he came to New York to earn a living he felt that he was doing so voluntarily, and was not obliged to do so. Now he was absolutely thrown upon his own resources, and must either work or starve. “They've treated you real mean,” said Reuben. “I never did like Mrs. Brent, or Jonas either, for that matter. “Where are you working?” Phil answered this question and several others which his honest country friend asked, but his mind was preoccupied, and he answered some of the questions at random. Finally he excused himself on the ground that he must be getting back to the store. That evening Phil thought seriously of his position. Something must be done, that was very evident. His expenses exceeded his income, and he needed some clothing. There was no chance of getting his wages raised under a year, for he already received more pay than it was customary to give to a boy. What should he do? Phil decided to lay his position frankly before the only friend he had in the city likely to help him--Mr. Oliver Carter. The old gentleman had been so friendly and kind that he felt that he would not at any rate repulse him. After he had come to this decision he felt better. He determined to lose no time in calling upon Mr. Carter. After supper he brushed his hair carefully, and made himself look as well as circumstances would admit.",

She says you are an adventurer, and have designs on Uncle Oliver because he is rich.” “I shall not ask your mother for any favor,” said Phil, provoked. “I am sorry not to meet your uncle.” “I dare say!” sneered Alonzo.

Just behind her came Mrs. Pitkin, whose face wore a chilly and proud look. “Mr. Carter has left the city, and I really don't know when he will return,” Phil heard her say. “If he had been at home, it would not have benefited you. He is violently prejudiced against you, and would not have listened to a word you had to say.” “I did not think he would have harbored resentment so long,” murmured the poor woman.",

Philip joined her in the street. “Are you really the cousin of Mrs. Pitkin?” he asked. “Yes,” answered Mrs. Forbush. “I bear the same relationship to Mr. Carter that she does. We were much together as girls, and were both educated at the same expensive schools. I offended my relatives by marrying Mr. Forbush, whose fault was that he was poor, and chiefly, I think, through the efforts of Lavinia Pitkin I was cast out by the family. But where did you meet Uncle Oliver?” Philip explained the circumstances already known to the reader. “Mr. Carter seems to me to be a kind-hearted man,” he said. “I don't believe he would have cast you off if he had not been influenced by other parties.” “So I think,” said Mrs. Forbush. “I will tell you,” she continued, after a pause, “what drew me here this afternoon. I am struggling hard to keep my head above water, Mr. Brent, but I find it hard to meet my expenses.

The week's wages were put up in small envelopes and handed to the various clerks. When Phil went up to the cashier to get his money he put it quietly into his vest-pocket. Daniel Dickson, the cashier, observing this, said: “Brent, you had better open your envelope.” Rather surprised, Phil nevertheless did as requested. In the envelope, besides the five-dollar bill representing his week's salary, he found a small slip of paper, on which was written these ominous words: “Your services will not be required after this week.” Appended to this notice was the name of the firm. Phil turned pale, for to him, embarrassed as he was, the loss of his place was a very serious matter. “What does this mean, Mr. Dickson?” he asked quickly. “I can't inform you,” answered the cashier, smiling unpleasantly, for he was a selfish man who sympathized with no one, and cared for no one as long as he himself remained prosperous. “Who handed you this paper?” asked Phil. Mr. Pitkin was still in his little office, and Phil made his way directly to him. “May I speak to you, sir?” asked our hero. “Be quick about it then, for I am in a hurry,” answered Pitkin, in a very forbidding tone.",

Phil emerged upon the street with a sinking heart. His available funds consisted only of the money he had just received and seventy-five cents in change, and what he was to do he did not know. He walked home with slow steps, looking sad in spite of his usually hopeful temperament. When he entered the house he met Mrs. Forbush in the hall.

In New York, as many of my young readers may know, the first of May is moving-day, and leases generally begin at that date. Engagements are made generally by or before March 1st. Mr. Stone, the landlord, called upon the widow to ascertain whether she proposed to remain in the house. “I suppose I may as well do so,” said Mrs. Forbush. She had had difficulty in making her monthly payments, but to move would involve expense, and it might be some time before she could secure boarders in a new location. “You can't do better,” said the landlord. “At fifty dollars a month this is a very cheap house.” “You mean forty-five? Mr. Stone?” said Mrs. Forbush. “No, I don't,” said the landlord. “But that is what I have been paying this last year.” “That is true, but I ought to get fifty dollars, and if you won't pay it somebody else will.” “Mr. Stone,” said the widow, in a troubled voice, “I hope you will be considerate. It has been as much as I could do to get together forty-five dollars each month to pay you. Indeed, I can pay no more.” “Pardon me for saying that that is no affair of mine,” said the landlord brusquely. “If you can't pay the rent, by all means move into a smaller house.",

However, that is your affair.” The landlord left the house, and Mrs. Forbush sat down depressed. “Julia,” she said to her daughter, “I wish you were old enough to advise me. I dislike to move, but I don't dare to engage to pay such a rent. Fifty dollars a month will amount to----” “Six hundred dollars a year!” said Julia, who was good at figures. “And that seems a great sum to us.” “It would be little enough to Mrs. Pitkin,” said Julia, who felt that lady's prosperity unjust, while her poor, patient mother had to struggle so hard for a scanty livelihood. “Oh, yes; Lavinia is rolling in wealth,” sighed Mrs. Forbush. “I can't understand how Uncle Oliver can bestow his favors on so selfish a woman.” “Why don't you ask Philip's advice about keeping the house?” said Julia. It must be explained that Philip and Julia were already excellent friends, and it may be said that each was mutually attracted by the other. “Poor Philip has his own troubles,” said Mrs. Forbush. “He has lost his place through the malice and jealousy of Mr. and Mrs. Pitkin, for I am sure that Lavinia is the cause of his dismissal, and I don't know when he will be able to get another.” “You won't send him away, mother, if he can't pay his board?” “No,” answered her mother warmly.",

You know I haven't any brother, and Phil seems just like a brother to me.” Just then the door opened, and Philip himself entered the room. Generally he came home looking depressed, after a long and ineffectual search for employment. Now he was fairly radiant with joy. “Phil, you've got a place; I know you have!” exclaimed Julia, noticing his glad expression. “Where is it? Is it a good one?” “Have you really got a place, Philip?” asked Mrs. Forbush. “Yes, for the present.” “Do you think you shall like your employer?” “He is certainly treating me very well,” said Phil, smiling. “He has paid me twenty dollars in advance.” “Then the age of wonders has not passed,” said the widow. “Of course I believe you, Philip, but it seems extraordinary.” “There is something more extraordinary to come,” said Phil. “He has sent you some money, too.” “Me!” exclaimed Mrs. Forbush, in great surprise. “What can he know about me?” “I told him about you.” “But we are strangers.” “He used to know you, and still feels an interest in you, Mrs.",

Why, he is in Florida.” “No; he came home from Charleston. I happened to be at the pier--I went down to see if I could get a job at smashing baggage--when I saw him walking down the gang-plank.” “Has he gone to his old quarters at Mr. Pitkin's?” “No; what I told about the way they treated you and me made him angry, and he drove to the Astor House. I have a room there, too, and am to act as his private secretary.” “So that is your new situation, Phil?” said Julia. “Yes, and it is a good one.” “And he really feels kindly to me?” said Mrs. Forbush hopefully. “He sends you this and will call to-morrow,” said Phil. “Actions speak louder than words. There are a hundred dollars in this roll of bills.” “He sent all this to me?” she said. “Yes, and of his own accord. It was no suggestion of mine. “Julia,” said Mrs. Forbush, turning to her daughter, “I believe God has heard my prayer, and that better days are in store for all of us.” “Philip included,” added Phil, smiling. “Yes. I want you to share in our good fortune.” “Mother, you had better consult Phil about keeping the house.”",

What do you think?” “I think, Mrs. Forbush, you had better not decide till you have seen your uncle. He may have some plan of his own for you. At any rate, you had better consult him. He will call to-morrow. And now, let me pay you for my week's board.” “No, Philip. I shall not want it with all this money, which I should not have received but for you.” “A debt is a debt, Mrs. Forbush, and I prefer to pay it. I shall not be here to supper, as Mr. Carter is expecting me back to the Astor House. I shall probably come with him when he calls upon you to-morrow.” On his return to the hotel, as he was walking on Broadway, Phil came face to face with Alonzo Pitkin. “I think I'll ask him about that letter his uncle gave him to post to me,” thought Phil, and he waited until Alonzo was close at hand. Alonzo, who had his share of curiosity, as soon as he saw Phil's approach, determined to speak to him, and ascertain what were his plans and what he was doing. With the petty malice which he inherited from his mother, he hoped that Phil had been unable to find a place and was in distress. “It would serve him right,” said Alonzo to himself, “for trying to get into Uncle Oliver's good graces.",

I have a much better situation than I had with your father.” Alonzo's lower jaw fell.

You can call me Mr. Pitkin.” Phil laughed at Alonzo's assumption of dignity, but made no comment upon it. “I want to ask you what you did with that letter Mr. Carter gave you to post for me?” asked Phil. Alonzo was indeed surprised, not to say dismayed. The truth was that, judging from the “feel” of the letter, it contained money, and he had opened it and appropriated the money to his own use. Moreover he had the bank-note in his pocket at that very moment, not having any wish to spend, but rather to hoard it. “That's a queer question,” he stammered. “What letter do you refer to?” “A letter Mr. Carter gave you to mail to me.” “If he gave me any such letter I mailed it,” answered Alonzo, scarcely knowing what to say. “I didn't receive it.” “How do you know he gave me any letter?” demanded Alonzo, puzzled.",

She's as poor as poverty,” sneered Alonzo. “She is none the worse for that.” “Uncle Oliver can't bear her!” “Indeed!” said Phil; pausing to see what else Alonzo would say. “Ma says she disgraced herself, and all her relations gave her up.

Alonzo did not see fit to answer this, but walked away with his head in the air. He was, however, not quite easy in mind. “How in the world,” he asked himself, “could that boy have found out that Uncle Oliver gave me a letter to post?

Much as they would have been opposed to Phil's receiving such a letter, they would have been too wise to sanction such a bold step. “Well,” said Mr. Carter, when Phil returned, “did you see Rebecca--Mrs. Forbush?” “Yes, sir, and handed her the money. She was overjoyed; not so much at receiving so generous a sum as at learning that you were reconciled to her.” “Poor girl!” said the old man, forgetting that she was now a worn woman. “I am afraid that she must have suffered much.” “She has met with many hardships, sir, but she won't mind them now.” “If I live her future shall be brighter than her past.

Your education must be good.” “Yes, sir, thanks to my father, or the man whom I always regarded as my father.

Nonsense! I have been very unkind to neglect you so long. But it wasn't all my fault. There were others who did all they could to keep us apart. You have lost your husband?” “Yes, uncle.

Mrs. Forbush was in favor of selecting very plain articles, but her uncle overruled her, and pointed out costumes much more costly. “But, uncle,” objected Mrs. Forbush, “these things won't at all correspond with our plain home and mode of living. Think of a boarding-house keeper arrayed like a fine lady.” “You are going to give up taking boarders--that is, you will have none but Philip and myself.” “Will you really live with us, uncle?",

Mr. Carter selected the second floor for his own use; a good-sized room on the third was assigned to Philip, and Mrs. Forbush was told to select such rooms for Julia and herself as she desired. “This is much finer than Mrs. Pitkin's house,” said Philip. “She will be jealous when she hears of it.” “No doubt.

Mr. Carter, whose back had been turned, turned about and faced his niece. “Oh, it is you, Lavinia!” he said quietly. “What are you doing?” asked his niece. “As you see, I am packing my trunk.” “Do you intend to leave us?” faltered Mrs. Pitkin. “I think it will be well for me to make a change,” said Mr. Carter. “This is, indeed, a sad surprise,” said Mrs Pitkin mournfully. “When did you return from Florida?” “I have never been there. I changed my mind when I reached Charleston.” “How long have you been in the city?”",

There were no tears in them, but she was making an attempt to touch the heart of her uncle. “Are you aware that Rebecca Forbush is in the city?” asked the old gentleman abruptly. “Ye-es,” answered Mrs. Pitkin, startled. “Ye-es. She came here one day.” “And how did you treat her?” asked Mr. Carter, severely. “Did you not turn the poor woman from the house, having no regard for her evident poverty? Did you not tell her that I was very angry with her, and would not hear her name mentioned?” “Ye-es, I may have said so. You know, Uncle Oliver, you have held no communication with her for many years.” “That is true--more shame to me!” “And I thought I was carrying out your wishes in discouraging her visits.” “You also thought that she might be a dangerous rival in my favor, and might deprive you and Alonzo of an expected share in my estate.” “Oh, Uncle Oliver! how can you think so poorly of me?” Mr. Carter eyed his niece with a half-smile. “So I do you injustice, do I, Lavinia?” he returned. “Yes, great injustice.” “I am glad to hear it. I feel less objection now to telling you what are my future plans.” “What are they?” asked Mrs. Pitkin apprehensively. “I have lived for ten years under your roof, and have had no communication, as you say, with Rebecca.",

I have accordingly installed her as mistress of my house in Madison Avenue, and shall henceforth make my home with her.” Mrs. Pitkin felt as if the earth was sinking under her feet. The hopes and schemes of so many years had come to naught, and her hated and dreaded cousin was to be constantly in the society of the rich uncle. “Rebecca has played her cards well,” she said bitterly. “She has not played them at all. She did not seek me. I sought her.” “How did you know she was in the city?” “I learned it from--Philip!” There was fresh dismay. “So that boy has wormed his way into your confidence!” said Mrs. Pitkin bitterly. “After acting so badly that Mr. Pitkin was obliged to discharge him, he ran to you to do us a mischief.” “Why was he discharged?” demanded Mr. Carter sternly. “Why did your husband seize the opportunity to get rid of a boy in whom he knew me to be interested as soon as he thought I was out of the way? Why, moreover, did he refuse the boy a reference, without which Philip could scarcely hope to get employment?” “You will have to ask Mr. Pitkin. I am sure he had good reason for the course he took. He's an impudent, low upstart in my opinion.” “So he is, ma!” chimed in Alonzo, with heartiness. “Ah! I have something to say to you, Alonzo,” said Mr. Carter, turning his keen glances upon the boy. “What became of that letter I gave to you to post just before I went away?” “I put it in the letter-box,” said Alonzo nervously.",

When Lonny is so devoted to you, too!” “I never noticed any special devotion,” said Mr. Carter, amused. “You are mistaken, however, about Philip trying to injure him. I simply asked Philip whether he had received such a letter, and he said no.” “I dare say he did receive it,” said Mrs. Pitkin spitefully. “We won't argue the matter now,” said the old gentleman. “I will only say that you and Alonzo, and Mr. Pitkin also, have gone the wrong way to work to secure my favor. You have done what you could to injure two persons, one your own cousin, because you were jealous.” “You judge me very hardly, uncle,” said Mrs. Pitkin, seeing that she must adopt a different course. “I have no bad feeling against Rebecca, and as to the boy, I will ask my husband to take him back into the store.",

Yet they did not dare to show their resentment. They had found that Uncle Oliver had a will of his own, and meant to exercise it. Had they been more forbearing he would still be an inmate of their house instead of going over to the camp of their enemies, for so they regarded Mrs. Forbush and Phil. “I hate that woman, Mr. Pitkin!” said his wife fiercely. “I scorn such underhanded work. How she has sneaked into the good graces of poor, deluded Uncle Oliver!” “You have played your cards wrong, Lavinia,” said her husband peevishly. “I? That is a strange accusation, Mr. Pitkin. It was you, to my thinking. You sent off that errand boy, and that is how the whole thing came about. If he had been in your store he wouldn't have met Uncle Oliver down at the pier.” “You and Alonzo persuaded me to discharge him.” “Oh, of course it's Alonzo and me! When you see Rebecca Forbush and that errand boy making ducks and drakes out of Uncle Oliver's money you may wish you had acted more wisely.” “Really, Lavinia, you are a most unreasonable woman. It's no use criminating and recriminating. We must do what we can to mend matters.” “They haven't got the money yet--remember that! We must try to re-establish friendly relations with Mr. Carter.” “Perhaps you'll tell me how?” “Certainly!",

The advice was unpalatable, but it was evidently sound. Uncle Oliver was rich, and they must not let his money slip through their fingers. So, after duly instructing Alonzo in his part, Mrs. Pitkin, a day or two later, ordered her carriage and drove in state to the house of her once poor relative. “Is Mrs. Forbush at home?” she asked of the servant. “I believe so, madam,” answered a dignified man-servant. “Take this card to her.” Mrs. Pitkin and Alonzo were ushered into a drawing-room more elegant than their own. She sat on a sofa with Alonzo. “Who would think that Rebecca Forbush would come to live like this?” she said, half to herself. “And that boy,” supplemented Alonzo. “To be sure! Your uncle is fairly infatuated.” Just then Mrs. Forbush entered, followed by her daughter. She was no longer clad in a shabby dress, but wore an elegant toilet, handsome beyond her own wishes, but insisted upon by Uncle Oliver. “I am glad to see you, Lavinia,” she said simply. “This is my daughter.” Julia, too, was stylishly dressed, and Alonzo, in spite of his prejudices, could not help regarding this handsome cousin with favor.",

He did not say it was a pleasure, for he was a boy of truth, and he did not feel that it would be. Uncle Oliver was partially deceived by his niece's new manner. He was glad that there seemed to be a reconciliation, and he grew more cordial than he had been since his return. After awhile Mrs. Pitkin rose to go. When she was fairly in the carriage once more, she said passionately: “You were awful sweet on them, ma!” said Alonzo, opening his eyes. “I had to be. But the time will come when I will open the eyes of Uncle Oliver to the designs of that scheming woman and that artful errand boy.” It was Mrs. Pitkin's true self that spoke. Among the duties which devolved upon Phil was Mr. Carter's bank business. He generally made deposits for Uncle Oliver, and drew money on his personal checks whenever he needed it. It has already been said that Mr. Carter was a silent partner in the firm of which Mr. Pitkin was the active manager. The arrangement between the partners was, that each should draw out two hundred dollars a week toward current expenses, and that the surplus, if any, at the end of the year, should be divided according to the terms of the partnership.

That's what I had to write in my copy-book once.” Phil was received by Mr. Pitkin with more graciousness than he expected. He felt that he must do what he could to placate Uncle Oliver, but he was more dangerous when friendly in his manner than when he was rude and impolite. He was even now plotting to get Phil into a scrape which should lose him the confidence of Uncle Oliver. Generally Phil was paid in a check payable to the order of Mr. Carter. But one Saturday two hundred dollars in bills were placed in his hands instead. “You see how much confidence I place in your honesty,” said Mr. Pitkin. “You couldn't use the check. This money you could make off with.” “It would be very foolish, to say the least,” responded Phil. “Of course, of course.

He knew there was no haste, and a walk up the great busy thoroughfare had its attractions for him, as it has for many others.

As I made the payment, I cannot, of course, be responsible for its not reaching you. You will pardon my saying that it would have been wiser to employ a different messenger.” “Why?” demanded Uncle Oliver, looking displeased. “Why, really, Uncle Oliver,” said Mr. Pitkin, “I should think the result might convince you of that.” “We had better let Philip tell his story,” said Mr. Carter quietly. “How did it happen, Philip?” Thereupon Philip told the story already familiar to the reader. “Upon my word, quite a romantic story!” commented Mr. Pitkin, unable to repress a sneer. “So you were tracked by a rascal, lured into a den of thieves, robbed of your money, or, rather, Mr. Carter's, and only released by the house catching fire?” “That is exactly what happened to me, sir,” said Philip, coloring with indignation, for he saw that Mr.",

From the cupola which surmounts the roof can be seen in the distance the waters of Lake Michigan, stretching for many miles from north to south and from east to west, like a vast inland sea. The level lawns, the greenhouses, the garden with rare plants and flowers, show clearly that this is the abode of a rich man. My readers will be specially interested to know that this is the luxurious and stately home of Mr. Granville, whose son's fortunes we have been following. This, too, is the home of Mrs. Brent and Jonas, who, under false representations, have gained a foothold in the home of the Western millionaire. Surely it is a great change for one brought up like Jonas to be the recognized heir and supposed son of so rich a man! It is a change, too, for his mother, who, though she dare not avow the relationship, is permitted to share the luxury of her son. Mrs. Brent has for her own use two of the best rooms in the mansion, and so far as money can bring happiness, she has every right to consider herself happy. Not as happy as she anticipated. To begin with, she is always dreading that some untoward circumstance will reveal the imposition she has practiced upon Mr. Granville. In that case what can she expect but to be ejected in disgrace from her luxurious home?",

Besides, she finds cause for anxiety in Jonas, and the change which his sudden and undeserved elevation has wrought in him. It requires a strong mind to withstand the allurements and temptations of prosperity, and Jonas is far from possessing a strong mind. He is, indeed, if I may be allowed the expression, a vulgar little snob, utterly selfish, and intent solely upon his own gratification. He has a love for drink, and against the protests of his mother and the positive command of Mr. Granville, indulges his taste whenever he thinks he can do so without fear of detection. To the servants he makes himself very offensive by assuming consequential airs and a lordly bearing, which excites their hearty dislike. He is making his way across the lawn at this moment. He is dressed in clothes of the finest material and the most fashionable cut. A thick gold chain is displayed across his waistcoat, attached to an expensive gold watch, bought for him by his supposed father. He carries in his hand a natty cane, and struts along with head aloft and nose in the air. Two under-gardeners are at work upon a flowerbed as he passes. “What time is it, Master Philip?” says one, a boy about a year older than Jonas. “My good boy,” said Jonas haughtily, “I don't carry a watch for your benefit.” The gardener bit his lip, and surveyed the heir with unequivocal disgust.",

Formerly he had returned her affection in a slight degree, but since he had figured as a rich man's son and heir he had begun, incredible as it may appear, to look down upon his own mother. She was not wholly ignorant of this change in his feelings, and it made her unhappy. He was all she had to live for. But for him she would not have stooped to take part in the conspiracy in which she was now a participant. It seemed hard that her only son, for whom she had sinned, should prove so ungrateful. “My boy,” she said, “I would not on any account harm you or injure your prospects, but when we are alone there can be no harm in my treating you as my son.” “It can't do any good,” grumbled Jonas, “and we might be overheard.” “I will be cautious. You may be sure of that. But why do you look so annoyed?” “Why? Reason enough. That boy Dan, the under-gardener, has been impudent to me.” “He has?” said Mrs. Brent quickly. “What has he done?” Jonas rehearsed the story. He found in his mother a sympathetic listener. “He is bold!” she said, compressing her lips. “Yes, he is. When I told him I would have him turned off, he coolly turned round and said that my father was a gentleman, and wouldn't send him away. Ma, will you do me a favor?”",

I hear that a cousin of Mrs. Brent occupies it. I shall call and inquire after her.” “Very well, Philip. Go when you please. You may be sure of a welcome when you return.” In Planktown, though his home relations latterly had not been pleasant, Philip had many friends, and when he appeared on the street, he met everywhere glances of friendly welcome. One of the first to meet him was Tommy Kavanagh. “Where did you come from, Phil?” he asked. “I am glad enough to see you. Where are you staying?” “Nowhere, Tommy, at present.

But she has made a mistake in thinking she can treat me meanly. I AM IN A POSITION TO TURN THE TABLES UPON HER! This paper--if she dreamed I had found it, she would yield to all my demands.” He laid his hand upon a paper, folded lengthwise, and presenting the appearance of a legal document. He opened the paper and read aloud: “To the boy generally known as Philip Brent and supposed, though incorrectly, to be my son, I bequeath the sum of five thousand dollars, and direct the same to be paid over to any one whom he may select as guardian, to hold in trust for him until he attains the age of twenty-one.” “This will Mrs. Brent carefully concealed,” continued Mr. Raynor, “in order to save the money for herself and Jonas. I wonder she was not prudent enough to burn it, or, at any rate, to take it with her when she left Planktown. It is a damaging secret, but I hold it, and I mean to use it, too. Let me see, what is it best to do?” Mr. Raynor spent some time in quiet thought. It seemed to him that it might be well to hint his discovery in a letter to Mrs. Brent, and to make it the basis of a demand for a generous sum of hush-money--one thousand dollars, at least. He might have decided to do this but for an incident which suggested another course.",

I am glad to see you,” said Mr. Raynor; and Phil entered the house, surprised at a reception much more cordial than he had expected. In that brief moment Mr. Raynor had decided to reveal the secret to Phil, and trust to his gratitude for a suitable acknowledgment. In this way he would revenge himself upon Mrs. Brent, who had treated him so meanly. “I have been wishing to see you, for I have a secret of importance to communicate,” said Mr. Raynor. “If it relates to my parents, I know it already,” said Phil. “No; it is something to your advantage. In revealing it I make Mrs. Brent my enemy, and shall forfeit the help she is giving me.” “If it is really of advantage to me, and I am able to make up your loss to you, I will do it,” said Phil. “That is sufficient. I will trust to your honor. You look like a boy who will keep a promise though not legally bound.” “You only do me justice, Mr. Raynor.” “Then cast your eye upon this paper and you will know the secret.” “Is it a will?” exclaimed Phil, in surprise.",

What puzzles me however, is her leaving behind such tell-tale evidence. It is a remarkable oversight. Do you think she is aware of the existence of the will?” “I think she must be, though I hope not,” answered Phil. “I should like to think that she had not conspired to keep back my share of father's estate.” “At any rate, the first thing to do is evidently to find her out, and confront her with the evidence of her crime--that is, supposing her to be really culpable.” “Then you approve of my going to Chicago?” said Phil. “Most emphatically. Nay, more--I will go with you.” “Will you indeed, sir?” said Phil joyfully. “You are very kind. I shrank from going alone, being a boy ignorant of business.” “A pretty shrewd boy, however,” said Mr. Carter, smiling. “I don't claim much credit, however, as I have some interests in Chicago to which I can attend with advantage personally. I am interested in a Western railroad, the main office of which is in that city.” “When shall we go, sir?” “To-morrow,” answered Mr. Carter promptly. “The sooner the better.

They arrived in due season, without any adventure worth naming, and took rooms at the Palmer House. Now, it so happened that in the same hotel at the very same moment were three persons in whom Phil was vitally interested. These were Mrs. Brent, Jonas, otherwise called Philip Granville, and Mr. Granville himself. Let me explain their presence in Chicago, when, as we know, Mr. Granville's house was situated at some distance away. Jonas had preferred a petition to go to Chicago for a week, in order to attend some of the amusements there to be enjoyed, alleging that it was awfully dull in the country. Mr. Granville was inclined to be very indulgent, to make up for the long years in which he had been compelled practically to desert his son. The petition therefore received favor. “It is only natural that you should wish to see something of the city, my son,” he said. “I will grant your request. We will go to Chicago, and remain a week at the Palmer House. Mrs. Brent, will you accompany us?” “With pleasure, Mr. Granville,” answered that lady. “It is not dull here for me, still I shall no doubt enjoy a little excitement. At any rate, I shall be best pleased to be where you and your son are.” “Then so let it be. We will go to-morrow.” One secret wish and scheme of Mrs.",

She, therefore, made herself as agreeable as possible to Mr. Granville, anticipated his every wish, and assumed the character, which she did not possess, of a gracious and feminine woman of unruffled good humor and sweetness of disposition. “I say, ma,” Jonas observed on one occasion, “you've improved ever so much since you came here. You're a good deal better natured than you were.” Mrs. Brent smiled, but she did not care to take her son into her confidence. “Here I have no cares to trouble me,” she said. “I live here in a way that suits me.” But when they were about starting for Chicago, Mrs. Brent felt herself becoming unaccountably depressed. “Jonas,” she said, “I am sorry we are going to Chicago.” “Why, ma? We'll have a splendid time.” “I feel as if some misfortune were impending over us,” said his mother, and she shivered apprehensively. But it was too late to recede. Besides, Jonas wished to go, and she had no good reason to allege for breaking the arrangement.",

It did not make it certain that she lived in the town. “We are only at the beginning of our perplexities, Philip,” said Mr. Carter. “Your friends may be near us, or they may be a hundred miles away.” “One method of finding them is barred, that of advertising, since they undoubtedly do not care to be found, and an advertisement would only place them on their guard.” “What would you advise, sir?” “We might employ a detective to watch the post-office, but here again there might be disappointment. Mrs. Brent might employ a third person to call for her letters. However, I have faith to believe that sooner or later we shall find her. Time and patience accomplishes much.” “Were you ever a detective, sir?” asked Phil, smiling. “No, Philip, but I have had occasion to employ them. Now how would you like to go to the theater this evening?” “There is a good play running at McVicker's Theatre. We will go there.” “Anywhere will suit me, Mr. Carter.” “Young people are easily satisfied,” he said. “When they get older they get more fastidious. However, there is generally something attractive at McVicker's.” It so happened that Philip and his employer took a late dinner, and did not reach the theater till ten minutes after the hour.",

You cannot allow these people to elude you. Go to the hotel, ask a direction to the nearest detective office, have a man detailed to come here directly, and let him find, if necessary, where your step-mother and her son are living.” Philip did so, and it was the close of the second act before he returned.

Was it the voice of nature which spoke from the striking face of the boy? “You have made a mistake, boy,” said Mrs. Brent, summoning all her nerve. “I am not the lady you mention, and this boy does not bear the name of Jonas.” “What is his name, then?” demanded Philip. “My name is Philip Granville,” answered Jonas quickly. “Is it? Then it has changed suddenly,” answered Phil, in a sarcastic voice. “Six months ago, when we were all living at Planktown, your name was Jonas Webb.” “You must be a lunatic!” said Mrs. Brent, with audacious falsehood. “My own name is Philip, as you very well know.” “Your name Philip?” exclaimed Mr. Granville, with an excitement which he found it hard to control. “Yes, sir; the lady is my step-mother, and this boy is her son Jonas.” “And you--whose son are you?” gasped Mr. Granville. “I don't know, sir.

Mrs. Brent was forced to acknowledge the imposition she had practiced upon Mr. Granville. “What could induce you to enter into such a wicked conspiracy?” asked Mr. Granville, shocked. “The temptation was strong--I wished to make my son rich. Besides, I hated Philip.” “It is well your wicked plan has been defeated; it might have marred my happiness forever.” “What are you going to do with me?” she asked coolly, but not without anxiety. It was finally settled that the matter should be hushed up. Philip wished to give up the sum bequeathed him by Mr. Brent; but to this Mr. Granville objected, feeling that it would constitute a premium on fraud. Besides, Mrs. Brent would have the residue of the estate, amounting to nearly ten thousand dollars. Being allowed to do what he chose with this money, he gave it in equal portions to Tommy Kavanagh and Mr. Raynor, who had informed him of the existence of Mr. Brent's will. Mrs. Brent decided not to go back to Planktown. She judged that the story of her wickedness would reach that village and make it disagreeable for her. She opened a small millinery store in Chicago, and is doing fairly well. But Jonas is her chief trouble, as he is lazy and addicted to intemperate habits. His chances of success and an honorable career are small. “How can I spare you, Philip?” said Mr. Carter regretfully.",

Mrs. Forbush and her daughter are the recognized heirs of Mr. Carter, who is wholly estranged from the Pitkins. He ascertained, through a detective, that the attack upon Philip by the man who stole from him the roll of bills was privately instigated by Mr. Pitkin himself, in the hope of getting Philip into trouble. Mr. Carter, thereupon, withdrew his capital from the firm, and Mr. Pitkin is generally supposed to be on the verge of bankruptcy. At any rate, his credit is very poor, and there is a chance that the Pitkins may be reduced to comparative poverty. “I won't let Lavinia suffer,” said Uncle Oliver; “if the worst comes to the worst, I will settle a small income, say twelve hundred dollars, on her, but we can never be friends.” As Phil grew older--he is now twenty-one--it seems probable that he and Mr. Carter may be more closely connected, judging from his gallant attentions to Julia Forbush, who has developed into a charming young lady. Nothing would suit Mr. Carter better, for there is no one who stands higher in his regard than Philip Granville, the Errand Boy.",

The school was a fine one, the teachers strict, the classes large, the boys generally gentlemanly, and the moral tone pervading the whole, of the very best character. To lead a class in a school like this was an honor of which any boy might have been proud; and Fred, when he heard his name read off at the head of the roll, could have thrown up his well-worn Latin grammar, which he happened to have in his hand just at that moment, and hurrahed. It was quite a wonder to him afterward that he did not. As a class, boys are supposed to be generous. I really don't know whether they deserve to be considered so or not, but some four or five only in this large school envied Fred. The rest would probably have hurrahed with him; for Fred was a “capital good fellow,” and quite a favorite. “Bully for you!” whispered Ned Brown, his right-hand neighbor; but Ned was instantly disgraced, the eye of the teacher catching the words as they dropped from his lips. When school was over several of the boys rushed to the spot where Fred--his cap in his hand, and his dark hair blowing about every way--was standing. “I say,” said James Duncan, “I thought you would get it. You've worked like a Trojan and you deserve it.” “It's as good as getting the valedictory,” said Joe Stone.",

It will buy an apple apiece. Come on! Let's go down to old Granger's.

Old Grange can't abide a crowd and noise. It will make him cross, and all we shall get will be the specked and worm-eaten ones. Come, fall back, there!” Very quietly and obediently the boys, who always knew their leader, fell back, and Fred went into the little dark grocery alone.

Fred said that old Abel had given him as near a smile as could come to his yellow, wrinkled face. “Treat 'em,” he said, “treat 'em, eh? Wal, now, 'pears likely they'd eat you out of house and home. I never see a boy yet that couldn't go through a tenpenny nail, easy as not.” “We ARE always hungry, I believe,” said Fred. “Allers, allers--that's a fact,” picking out the best apples as he spoke and heaping up the measure. “There, now if you'll find a better lot than that, for the money, you are welcome to it, that's all.” “Couldn't do it. Thank you very much,” said Fred. As the boys took the apples eagerly and began to bite them, they saw the old face looking out of the dirty panes of window glass upon them. Fred loved to make everybody happy around him, and this treating was only second best to leading his class; so when, at the corner of the street turning to his father's house, he parted from his young companions, I doubt whether there was a happier boy in all Andrewsville.

He treated boys who were larger and stronger than himself civilly, but was cruel and domineering over the poor and weak. So far in his life, though they met often, Fred had avoided coming into contact with Sam, and Sam had seemed to feel just a little awe of him; for Mr. Sargent was one of the wealthiest leading men in town, and Sam, in spite of himself, found something in the handsome, gentlemanly boy that held him in check; but to-day Sam's father had just beaten him, and the boy was smarting from the blows. I dare say he was hungry, and uncomfortable from many other causes; but however this may have been, he felt in the mood for making trouble; for seeing somebody else unhappy beside himself.

I don't know what you've done, but I ain't afeared there is any great harm in it, though your collar is on crooked and there's a tear in your jacket, to say nothing of a black and blue place under your left eye. But eat your tea. Here's some fruit cake Biddy sent o' purpose.” Somebody did think of and feel sorry for him! Fred felt comforted on the instant by Ellen's kind words and Biddy's plum cake; and I must say, ate a hearty, hungry boy's supper; then went to bed and slept soundly until late the next morning. We have not space to follow Fred through the tediousness of the following week. His father strictly carried out the punishment to the letter No one came near him but Ellen, though he heard the voices of his sisters and the usual happy home sounds constantly about him. Had Fred really been guilty, even in the matter of a street fight, he would have been the unhappiest boy living during this time; but we know he was not, so we shall be glad to hear that with his books and the usual medley of playthings with which a boy's room is piled, he contrived to make the time pass without being very wretched. It was the disgrace of being punished, the lost position in school, and above all, the triumph which it would be to Sam, which made him the most miserable. The very injustice of the thing was its balm in this case. May it be so, my young readers, with any punishment which may ever happen to you! All these things, however, were opening the way to make Fred's revenge, when it came, the more complete.",

   "text": "Fred Sargent, of course, had lost his place, and was subjected to a great many curious inquiries when he returned to school. He had done his best, in his room, to keep up with his class, but his books, studied “in prison,” as he had learned to call it, and in the sitting-room, with his sister Nellie and his mother to help him, were very different things. Still, “doing your best” always brings its reward; and let me say in passing, before the close of the month Fred had won his place again. This was more easily done than satisfying the kind inquiries of the boys. So after trying the first day to evade them, Fred made a clean breast of it and told the whole story. I think, perhaps, Mr. Sargent's severe and unjust discipline had a far better effect upon the boys generally than upon Fred particularly. They did not know how entirely Fred had acted on the defensive, and so they received a lesson which most of them never forgot on the importance which a kind, genial man, with a smile and a cheery word for every child in town, attached to brawling. After all, the worst effect of this punishment came upon Sam Crandon himself. Very much disliked as his wicked ways had made him before, he was now considered as a town nuisance. Everybody avoided him, and when forced to speak to him did so in the coldest, and often in the most unkind manner. Sam, not three weeks after his wanton assault upon Fred, was guilty of his first theft and of drinking his first glass of liquor.",

Skulking by day, prowling by night--hungry, dirty, beaten and sworn at--no wonder that he seemed God-forsaken as well as man-forsaken. Mr. Sargent had a large store in Rutgers street. He was a wholesale dealer in iron ware, and Andrewsville was such an honest, quiet town ordinary means were not taken to keep the goods from the hands of thieves. Back doors, side doors and front doors stood open all the day, and no one went in or out but those who had dealings with the firm. Suddenly, however, articles began to be missed--a package of knives, a bolt, a hatchet, an axe, a pair of skates, flat-irons, knives and forks, indeed hardly a day passed without a new thing being taken, and though every clerk in the store was on the alert and very watchful, still the thief, or thieves remained undetected. At last matters grew very serious. It was not so much the pecuniary value of the losses--that was never large--but the uncertainty into which it threw Mr. Sargent. The dishonest person might be one of his own trusted clerks; such things had happened, and sad to say, probably would again. “Fred,” said his father, one Saturday afternoon, “I should like to have you come down to the store and watch in one of the rooms. There is a great run of business to-day, and the clerks have their hands more than full. I must find out, if possible who it is that is stealing so freely. Yesterday I lost six pearl-handled knives worth two dollars apiece. Can you come?”",

It was fun for the first hour, and he was so much on the alert that old Mr. Stone, from his high stool before the desk, had frequently to put his pen behind his ear and watch him. It was quite a scene in a play to see how Fred would start at the least sound. A mouse nibbling behind a box of iron chains made him beside himself until he had scared the little gray thing from its hole, and saw it scamper away out of the shop. But after the first hour the watching FOR NOTHING became a little tedious. There was a “splendid” game of base ball to come off on the public green that afternoon; and after that the boys were going to the “Shaw-seen” for a swim; then there was to be a picnic on the “Indian Ridge,” and--well, Fred had thought of all these losses when he so pleasantly assented to his father's request, and he was not going to complain now. He sat down on a box, and commenced drumming tunes with his heels on its sides. This disturbed Mr. Stone. He looked at him sharply, so he stopped and sauntered out into a corner of the back store, where there was a trap-door leading down into the water.",

It was always one of the most interesting places in the store to Fred; he liked to sit with his feet hanging down over the water, watching it as it came in and dashed against the cellar walls. To-day it was high, and a smart breeze drove it in with unusual force. Bending down as far as he could safely to look under the store, Fred saw the end of a hatchet sticking out from the corner of one of the abutments that projected from the cellar, to support the end of the store in which the trap-door was. “What a curious place this is for a hatchet!” thought Fred, as he stooped a little further, holding on very tight to the floor above. What he saw made him almost lose his hold and drop into the water below. There, stretched along on a beam was Sam Crandon, with some stolen packages near him. For a moment Fred's astonishment was too great to allow him to speak; and Sam glared at him like a wild beast brought suddenly to bay. “Oh, Sam! Sam!” said Fred, at length, “how could you?” Sam caught up a hatchet and looked as if he was going to aim it at him, then suddenly dropped it into the water. Fred's heart beat fast, and the blood came and went from his cheeks; he caught his breath heavily, and the water, the abutment and even Sam with his wicked ugly face were for a moment darkened.",

He had only to lift his head and call his father, then the boat would be immediately pushed in under the store, Sam secured and his punishment certain. There were stolen goods enough to convict him, and his mode of ingress into the store was now certain. This trap-door was never locked; very often it was left open--the water being considered the most effectual bolt and bar that could be used; but Sam, a good swimmer and climber, had come in without difficulty and had quite a store of his own hidden away there for future use. This course was very plain; but for some reason, which Fred could not explain even to himself, he did not feel inclined to take it; so he sat looking steadily in Sam's face until he said: “Look here, Sam, I want to show you I mean what I say. I'm sorry you have turned thief and if I can help you to be a better boy, I should be glad to.” Again Fred's honest kindly face had the same effect upon Sam that it had at the commencement of their street fight; he respected and trusted it unconsciously. “Here!” said he, crawling along on the beam and handing back the package of knives, the last theft of which his father had complained. “Yes, that is right,” said Fred, leaning down and taking it, “give them all back, if you can; that is what my father calls 'making restitution,' and then you won't be a thief any longer.” Something in the boy's tone touched Sam's heart still more; so he handed back one thing after another as rapidly as he could until nearly everything was restored.",

It began Fred Sargent's revenge. “Now be off, will you, before the clerks come? They will see the things and catch you here. I'll be round to your house soon and we will see.” Even in this short time Fred had formed a general plan for saving Sam. The boy, stretching himself out flat, slipped down the transverse beam into the water, dived at once and came up under the bridge a few rods distant, then coolly passed down the river and swam to shore under a bunch of alder-bushes, by which he was concealed from the sight of the passers-by. Fred sought his father, told him the story, then brought him to the spot, showed the goods which the boy had returned, and begged as a reward for the discovery to be allowed to conceal his name. His father of course hesitated at so unusual a proposition; but there was something so very much in earnest in all Fred did and said that he became convinced it was best, for the present at least, to allow him to have his own way; and this he was very glad he had done when a few days after Fred asked him to do something for Sam Crandon.",

A boy who wants to reform should have a helping hand.” “He does want to--he wants to heartily; he says he does. Father, if you only will!” Fred, as he stood there, his whole face lit up with the glow of this generous, noble emotion, never was dearer to his father's heart; indeed his father's eyes were dim, and his voice a little husky, as he said again: “I will look after him, Fred, for your sake.” And so he did; but where and how I have not space now to tell my readers. Perhaps, at some future time, I may finish this story; for the present let me say there is a new boy in Mr. Sargent's store, with rough, coarse face, voice and manners; everybody wonders at seeing him there; everybody prophesies future trouble; but nobody knows that this step up in Sam Crandon's life is Fred Sargent's revenge.",

In front of the house spread a long beach, which terminated in precipitous cliffs and rocky ledges. On the afternoon of the day following his arrival, he declared his intention of exploring the beach. “Don't get caught in 'The Smuggler's Trap,'” said his uncle, as he mentioned his plan. “'The Smuggler's Trap?'” “Yes. It's at the end of the beach where you see the cliffs. It's a hollow cave, which you can only walk at very low tide. You'd better not go in there.” “Oh, never fear,” said Hubert carelessly, and in a few minutes he was wandering over the beach, and after walking about two miles reached the end of the beach at the base of the great cliffs. The precipice towered frowningly overhead, its base all worn and furrowed by the furious surges that for ages had dashed against it. All around lay a chaos of huge boulders covered with seaweed. The tide was now at the lowest ebb. The surf here was moderate, for the seaweed on the rocks interfered with the swell of the waters, and the waves broke outside at some distance. Between the base of the precipice and the edge of the water there was a space left dry by the ebb tide about two yards in width; and Hubert walked forward over the space thus uncovered to see what lay before him. He soon found himself in a place which seemed like a fissure rent in a mountain side, by some extraordinary convulsion of nature.",

On the side nearest was the precipice by whose base he had passed; while over opposite was a gigantic wall of dark rock, Which extended far out into the sea. Huge waves thundered at its feet and dashed their spray far upward into the air. The space was about fifty yards across. The fissure extended back for about two hundred yards, and there terminated in a sharp angle formed by the abrupt walls of the cliffs which enclosed it. All around there were caverns worn into the base of the precipices by the action of the sea. The floor of this place was gravelly, but near the water it was strewn with large boulders. Further in there were no boulders and it was easy to walk about. At the furthest extremity there was a flat rock that seemed to have fallen from the cliff above in some former age. The cliffs around were about two hundred feet in height. They were perfectly bare, and intensely black. On their storm-riven summits not a sign of verdure appeared. Everything had the aspect of gloom, which was heightened by the mournful monotone of the sea waves as they dashed against the rock. After the first feeling of awe had passed, Hubert ran forward, leaping from rock to rock, till he came to where the beach or floor of the fissure was gravelly. Over this he walked and hastened to the caverns, looking into them one after another. Then he busied himself by searching among the pebbles for curious stones and shells.",

Suddenly a sound burst upon his ears that roused him, and sent all the blood back to his heart. It was his own name, called out in a voice of anguish and almost of despair by his father.
