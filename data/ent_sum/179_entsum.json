   "text": "A narrow grave-yard in the heart of a bustling, indifferent city, seen from the windows of a gloomy-looking inn, is at no time an object of enlivening suggestion; and the spectacle is not at its best when the mouldy tombstones and funereal umbrage have received the ineffectual refreshment of a dull, moist snow-fall. If, while the air is thickened by this frosty drizzle, the calendar should happen to indicate that the blessed vernal season is already six weeks old, it will be admitted that no depressing influence is absent from the scene. This fact was keenly felt on a certain 12th of May, upwards of thirty years since, by a lady who stood looking out of one of the windows of the best hotel in the ancient city of Boston.",

In the chimney-place was a red-hot fire which emitted a small blue flame; and in front of the fire, at a table, sat a young man who was busily plying a pencil. He had a number of sheets of paper cut into small equal squares, and he was apparently covering them with pictorial designs--strange-looking figures. He worked rapidly and attentively, sometimes threw back his head and held out his drawing at arm’s-length, and kept up a soft, gay-sounding humming and whistling.",

She never dropped her eyes upon his work; she only turned them, occasionally, as she passed, to a mirror suspended above the toilet-table on the other side of the room. Here she paused a moment, gave a pinch to her waist with her two hands, or raised these members--they were very plump and pretty--to the multifold braids of her hair, with a movement half caressing, half corrective. An attentive observer might have fancied that during these periods of desultory self-inspection her face forgot its melancholy; but as soon as she neared the window again it began to proclaim that she was a very ill-pleased woman.",

The window-panes were battered by the sleet; the head-stones in the grave-yard beneath seemed to be holding themselves askance to keep it out of their faces. A tall iron railing protected them from the street, and on the other side of the railing an assemblage of Bostonians were trampling about in the liquid snow. Many of them were looking up and down; they appeared to be waiting for something. From time to time a strange vehicle drew near to the place where they stood,--such a vehicle as the lady at the window, in spite of a considerable acquaintance with human inventions, had never seen before: a huge, low omnibus, painted in brilliant colors, and decorated apparently with",

When it reached a certain point the people in front of the grave-yard, of whom much the greater number were women, carrying satchels and parcels, projected themselves upon it in a compact body--a movement suggesting the scramble for places in a life-boat at sea--and were engulfed in its large interior. Then the life-boat--or the life-car, as the lady at the window of the hotel vaguely designated it--went bumping and jingling away upon its invisible wheels, with the helmsman (the man at the wheel) guiding its course incongruously from the prow.",

On the other side of the grave-yard was a row of small red brick houses, showing a series of homely, domestic-looking backs; at the end opposite the hotel a tall wooden church-spire, painted white, rose high into the vagueness of the snow-flakes. The lady at the window looked at it for some time; for reasons of her own she thought it the ugliest thing she had ever seen. She hated it, she despised it; it threw her into a state of irritation that was quite out of proportion to any sensible motive. She had never known herself to care so much about church-spires.",

She turned away from the window at last, pressing her hands to her eyes. “It’s too horrible!” she exclaimed. “I shall go back--I shall go back!” And she flung herself into a chair before the fire. “Wait a little, dear child,” said the young man softly, sketching away at his little scraps of paper.

Though he bore a noticeable resemblance to his sister, he was a better favored person: fair-haired, clear-faced, witty-looking, with a delicate finish of feature and an expression at once urbane and not at all serious, a warm blue eye, an eyebrow finely drawn and excessively arched--an eyebrow which, if ladies wrote sonnets to those of their lovers, might have been made the subject of such a piece of verse--and a light moustache that flourished upwards as if blown that way by the breath of a constant smile.",

No,” the Baroness pursued, “it was precisely not to see you--such people as you--that I came.” “Such people as me?” cried Acton. “I had a sort of longing to come into those natural relations which I knew I should find here.

Felix was laughing at his answer. “It’s odd to hear you telling me how to be happy. I don’t think you know yourself, dear uncle.

He came to see her very often; but he had come to see her very often before. It was agreeable to him to find himself in her little drawing-room; but this was not a new discovery.

If this was love, love had been overrated.

In his younger years he had been--or he had tried to be--of the opinion that it would be a good deal “jollier” not to marry, and he had flattered himself that his single condition was something of a citadel.

She stopped him; she told him she wished to speak to him. “Why didn’t you go home with your cousin?” she asked. Clifford stared. “Why, Robert has taken her,” he said. “Exactly so. But you don’t usually leave that to him.” “Oh,” said Clifford, “I want to see those fellows start off. They don’t know how to drive.” “It is not, then, that you have quarreled with your cousin?” Clifford reflected a moment, and then with a simplicity which had, for the Baroness, a singularly baffling quality, “Oh, no; we have made up!” he said.",

Well, I guess not!” said Clifford, with a laugh. “Why haven’t you come, then?” “Well, because I am afraid of getting shut up in that back room.” Eugenia kept looking at him. “I should think you would like that.” “Like it!” cried Clifford. “I should, if I were a young man calling upon a charming woman.” “A charming woman isn’t much use to me when I am shut up in that back room!” “I am afraid I am not of much use to you anywhere!” said Madame Münster. “And yet you know how I have offered to be.” “Well,” observed Clifford, by way of response, “there comes the buggy.” “Never mind the buggy.

He wandered through the empty rooms on the large ground-floor of the house, and found her at last in a small apartment denominated, for reasons not immediately apparent, Mr. Wentworth’s “office:” an extremely neat and well-dusted room, with an array of law-books, in time-darkened sheep-skin, on one of the walls; a large map of the United States on the other, flanked on either side by an old steel engraving of one of Raphael’s Madonnas; and on the third several glass cases containing specimens of butterflies and beetles.",

Felix rubbed his forehead gently. “But _en attendant_ the last resort, your father lacks confidence,” he said to Gertrude. “Haven’t you confidence in Felix?” Gertrude was frowning; there was something about her that her father and Charlotte had never seen.
