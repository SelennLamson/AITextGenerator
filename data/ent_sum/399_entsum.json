   "text": "CAST UPON THE BREAKERS by Horatio Alger, Jr. A FAITHLESS GUARDIAN. “Well, good by, Rodney! I leave school tomorrow. I am going to learn a trade.” “I am sorry to part with you, David. Couldn’t you stay another term?” “No: my uncle says I must be earning my living, and I have a chance to learn the carpenter’s trade.” “Where are you going?” “To Duffield, some twenty miles away. I wish I were in your shoes. You have no money cares, and can go on quietly and complete your education.” “I don’t know how I am situated, David. I only know that my guardian pays my expenses at this boarding school.” “Yes, you are a star boarder, and have the nicest room in the institution. I am only a poor day scholar. Still I feel thankful that I have been allowed to remain as long as I have. Who is your guardian?” “A Mr. Benjamin Fielding, of New York.” “Is he a business man?” “Do you know how much you will inherit when you come of age?” asked David, after a short pause. “It seems to me your guardian ought to have told you.” “I scarcely know my guardian. Five years ago I spent a week at his home. I don’t remember much about it except that he lives in a handsome house, and has plenty of servants. Since then, as you know, I have passed most of my time here, except that in the summer I was allowed to board at the Catskills or any country place I might select.” “Yes, and I remember one year you took me with you and paid all my expenses.",

   "text": "I shall never forget your kindness, and how much I enjoyed that summer.” Rodney Ropes smiled, and his smile made his usually grave face look very attractive. “My dear David,” he said, “it was all selfishness on my part. I knew I should enjoy myself much better with a companion.” “You may call that selfishness, Rodney, but it is a kind of selfishness that makes me your devoted friend. How long do you think you shall remain at school?” “I don’t know. My guardian has never told me his plans for me. I wish he would.” “I shall miss you, Rodney, but we will correspond, won’t we?” “Surely. You know I shall always feel interested in you and your welfare.” David was a plain boy of humble parentage, and would probably be a hard working mechanic. In fact he was looking for nothing better. But Rodney Ropes looked to be of genteel blood, and had the air of one who had been brought up a gentleman. But different as they were in social position the two boys had always been devoted friends. The boarding school of which Rodney was, as his friend expressed himself, a star pupil, was situated about fifty miles from the city of New York. It was under the charge of Dr. Sampson, a tall, thin man of fair scholarship, keenly alive to his own interest, who showed partiality for his richer pupils, and whenever he had occasion to censure bore most heavily upon boys like David Hull, who was poor. Rodney occupied alone the finest room in the school.",

   "text": "There was a great contrast between his comfortable quarters and the extremely plain dormitories occupied by less favored pupils. In the case of some boys the favoritism of the teacher would have led them to put on airs, and made them unpopular with their school fellows. But Rodney had too noble a nature to be influenced by such considerations. He enjoyed his comfortable room, but treated his school fellows with a frank cordiality that made him a general favorite. After David left his room Rodney sat down to prepare a lesson in Cicero, when he was interrupted by the entrance through the half open door of a younger boy. “Rodney,” he said, “the doctor would like to see you in his office.” “Very well, Brauner, I will go down at once.” He put aside his book and went down to the office of Dr. Sampson on the first floor. The doctor was sitting at his desk. He turned slightly as Rodney entered. “Take a seat, Ropes,” he said curtly. His tone was so different from his usual cordiality that Rodney was somewhat surprised. “Am I in disgrace?” he asked himself. “Dr. Sampson doesn’t seem as friendly as usual.” After a brief interval Dr. Sampson wheeled round in his office chair. “I have a letter for you from your guardian, Ropes,” he said. “Here it is. Do me the favor to read it here.” With some wonder Rodney took the letter and read as follows:",

   "text": "DEAR RODNEY--I have bad news to communicate. As you know, I was left by your father in charge of you and your fortune. I have never told you the amount, but I will say now that it was about fifty thousand dollars. Until two years since I kept it intact but then began a series of reverses in which my own fortune was swallowed up. In the hope of relieving myself I regret to say that I was tempted to use your money. That went also, and now of the whole sum there remains but enough to pay the balance of your school bills, leaving you penniless. How much I regret this I cannot tell you. I shall leave New York at once. I do not care at present to say where I shall go, but I shall try to make good the loss, and eventually restore to you your lost fortune. I may be successful or I may not. I shall do my best and I hope in time to have better news to communicate. One thing I am glad to say. I have a casket containing your mother’s jewels. These are intact. I shall send you the casket by express, knowing that you will wish to keep them out of regard for your mother’s memory. In case you are reduced to the necessity of pawning or selling them, I am sure that your mother, could she be consulted, would advise you to do so. This would be better than to have you suffer from want. There is nothing further for me to write except to repeat my regret, and renew my promise to make up your lost fortune if I shall ever to able to do so. Your Guardian, BENJAMIN FIELDING.",

   "text": "Rodney read this like one dazed. In an instant he was reduced from the position of a favorite of fortune to a needy boy, with his living to make. He could not help recalling what had passed between his friend David and himself earlier in the day. Now he was as poor as David--poorer, in fact for David had a chance to learn a trade that would yield him a living, while he was utterly without resources, except in having an unusually good education. “Well,” said Dr. Sampson, “have you read your letter?” “Your guardian wrote to me also. This is his letter,” and he placed the brief epistle in Rodney’s hands. DR. SAMPSON--I have written my ward, Rodney Ropes, an important letter which he will show you. The news which it contains will make it necessary for him to leave school. I inclose a check for one hundred and twenty five dollars. Keep whatever is due you, and give him the balance. BENJAMIN FIELDING. “I have read the letter, but I don’t know what it means,” said Dr. Sampson. “Can you throw any light upon it?” “Here is my letter, doctor. You can read it for yourself.” Dr. Sampson’s face changed as he read Rodney’s letter. It changed and hardened, and his expression became quite different from that to which Rodney had been accustomed. “This is a bad business, Ropes,” said the doctor in a hard tone. He had always said Rodney before. “That was a handsome fortune which your father left you.” “Yes, sir.",

Mr. Fielding has treated you shamefully.” “Yes, sir, I suppose he has, but he says he will try to make it up to me in the future.” “Pish! that is all humbug. Even if he is favored by fortune you will never get back a cent.” “I think I shall, sir.” “You are young. You do not know the iniquities of business men. I do.” “I prefer to hope for the best.” “Just as you please.” “Have you anything more to say to me?” “Only that I will figure up your account and see how much money is to come to you out of the check your guardian has sent. You can stay here till Monday; then you will find it best to make new arrangements.”",

   "text": "Rodney left the room, realizing that Dr. Sampson’s feelings had been changed by his pupil’s reverse of fortune. It was the way of the world, but it was not a pleasant way, and Rodney felt depressed. THE CASKET OF JEWELS. It was not till the latter part of the afternoon that the casket arrived. Rodney was occupied with a recitation, and it was only in the evening that he got an opportunity to open it. There was a pearl necklace, very handsome, a pair of bracelets, two gold chains, some minor articles of jewelry and a gold ring. A locket attracted Rodney’s notice, and he opened it. It contained the pictures of his father and mother. His father he could barely remember, his mother died before he was old enough to have her image impressed upon his memory. He examined the locket and his heart was saddened. He felt how different his life would have been had his parents lived. He had never before realized the sorrow of being alone in the world. Misfortune had come upon him, and so far as he knew he had not a friend. Even Dr. Sampson, who had been paid so much money on his account, and who had always professed so great friendship for him, had turned cold. As he was standing with the locket in his hand there was a knock at the door. “Come in!” he called out. The door opened and a stout, coarse looking boy, dressed in an expensive manner, entered. “Good evening, John,” said Rodney, but not cordially.",

If there was anything Dr. Sampson bowed down to and respected it was wealth, and Mr. Bundy, senior, was reputed to be worth a considerable fortune. In Rodney’s mood John Bundy was about the last person whom he wanted to see. “Ha!” said John, espying the open casket, “where did you get all that jewelry?” “It contains my mother’s jewels,” said Rodney gravely. “You never showed it to me before.” “I never had it before. It came to me by express this afternoon.” “It must be worth a good pile of money,” said John, his eyes gleaming with cupidity.",

It won’t be of use to you, especially the diamond earrings,” he added, with a coarse laugh. “No,” answered Rodney shortly. “My eyes, wouldn’t my mother like to own all this jewelry. She’s fond of ornament, but pa won’t buy them for her.” Rodney did not answer. “I say, Ropes, I mustn’t forget my errand. Will you do me a favor?” “Lend me five dollars till the first of next month. My allowance comes due then. Now I haven’t but a quarter left.” “What makes you apply to me, Bundy?” “Because you always have money. I don’t suppose you are worth as much as my father, but you have more money for yourself than I have.” “I have had, perhaps, but I haven’t now.” “Why, what’s up? What has happened?” “I have lost my fortune.” John whistled. This was his way of expressing amazement. “Why, what have you been doing? How could you lose your fortune?” “My guardian has lost it for me. That amount to the same thing.” “When did you hear that?” “Is that true? Are you really a poor boy?” John Bundy was astonished, but on the whole he was not saddened. In the estimation of the school Rodney had always ranked higher than he, and been looked upon as the star pupil in point of wealth. Now that he was dethroned John himself would take his place. This would be gratifying, though just at present, and till the beginning of the next month, he would be distressed for ready money.",

I must get to work.” “Isn’t there anything left--not a cent?” “There may be a few dollars.” “And then,” said Bundy with a sudden thought, “there is this casket of jewelry. You can sell it for a good deal of money.” “I don’t mean to sell it.” “Then you’re a fool; that’s all I’ve got to say.” “I don’t suppose you will understand my feeling in the matter, but these articles belonged to my mother. They are all I have to remind me of her. I do not mean to sell them unless it is absolutely necessary.” “I would sell them quicker’n a wink,” said Bundy. “What’s the good of keeping them?” “We won’t discuss the matter,” said Rodney coldly. “Do you mind my telling the other boys about your losing your money?” “No; it will be known tomorrow at any rate; there is no advantage in concealing it.” A heavy step was heard outside. It stopped before the door. “I must be getting,” said Bundy, “or I’ll get into trouble.” It was against the rule at the school for boys to make calls upon each other in the evening unless permission were given. John Bundy opened the door suddenly, and to his dismay found himself facing the rigid figure of Dr. Sampson, the principal. “How do you happen to be here, Bundy?” asked the doctor sternly. “Please, sir, I was sympathizing with Ropes on his losing his money,” said Bundy with ready wit. “Very well! I will excuse you this time.” “I’m awful sorry for you, Ropes,” said Bundy effusively. “Thank you,” responded Rodney. “You can go now,” said the principal. “I have a little business with Master Ropes.” “All right, sir. Good night.”",

So these are the jewels, are they?” “They seem to be quite valuable,” went on the doctor, lifting the pearl necklace and poising it in his fingers. “It will be well for you to have them appraised by a jeweler.” “It would, sir, if I wished to sell them, but I mean to keep them as they are.” “I would hardly advise it. You will need the money. Probably you do not know how near penniless you are.” “No, sir; I don’t know.” “Your guardian, as you are aware, sent me a check for one hundred and twenty five dollars. I have figured up how much of this sum is due to me, and I find it to be one hundred and thirteen dollars and thirty seven cents.” “Yes, sir,” said Rodney indifferently. “This leaves for you only eleven dollars and sixty three cents. You follow me, do you not?” “Have you any money saved up from your allowance?” “A few dollars only, sir.” “Ahem! that is a pity. You will need all you can raise. But of course you did not anticipate what has occurred?” “I will throw off the thirty seven cents,” said the principal magnanimously, “and give you back twelve dollars.” “I would rather pay you the whole amount of your bill,” said Rodney. “Ahem! Well perhaps that would be more business-like. So you don’t wish to part with any of the jewelry, Ropes?”",

I shall miss you, and, if I could afford it, I would tell you to stay without charge. But I am a poor man.” “Yes,” said Rodney hastily, “I understand. I thank you for your words but would not under any circumstances accept such a favor at your hands.” “I am afraid you are proud, Ropes. Pride is--ahem--a wrong feeling.” “Perhaps so, Dr. Sampson, but I wish to earn my own living without being indebted to any one.” “Perhaps you are right, Ropes. I dare say I should feel so myself. When do you propose leaving us?” “Some time tomorrow, sir.” “I shall feel sad to have you go. You have been here so long that you seem to me like a son. But we must submit to the dispensations of Providence--” and Dr. Sampson blew a vigorous blast upon his red silk handkerchief. “I will give you the balance due in the morning.”",

The doctor had the reputation of being worth from thirty to forty thousand dollars, and his assumption of being a poor man Rodney knew to be a sham. He went to bed early, for tomorrow was to be the beginning of a new life for him. A STRANGE DISAPPEARANCE. When it was generally known in the school that Rodney was to leave because he had lost his property much sympathy was felt and expressed for him. Though he had received more than ordinary attention from the principal on account of his pecuniary position and expectations, this had not impaired his popularity. He never put on any airs and was on as cordial relations with the poorest student as with the richest. “I’m awfully sorry you’re going, Rodney,” said more than one. “Is it really true that you have lost your property?” “Do you feel bad about it?” “I feel sorry, but not discouraged.” “I say, Rodney,” said Ernest Rayner, in a low voice, calling Rodney aside, “are you very short of money?” “I haven’t much left, Ernest.” “Because I received five dollars last week as a birthday present. I haven’t spent any of it. You can have it as well as not.” Rodney was much moved. “My dear Ernest,” he said, putting his arm caressingly around the neck of the smaller boy, “you are a true friend. I won’t forget your generous offer, though I don’t need to accept it.” “But are you sure you have money enough?” asked Ernest.",

As to scholarship he was not ambitious to stand high in that. “I say, Ropes,” he said complacently, “I’m to have your room after you’re gone.” “I congratulate you,” returned Rodney. “It is an excellent room.” “Yes, I s’pose it’ll make you feel bad.

His trunk he left behind, promising to send for it when he had found a new boarding place. There was a chorus of good byes.

The instinct of self preservation is perhaps stronger than any other. Rodney and his seat mate both jumped to their feet and hurried to the door of the car, not knowing what was in store for them. But fortunately the train had not been going rapidly. It was approaching a station and was “slowing up.” So, though it had really run off the track, there was not likely to be any injury to the passengers. “We are safe,” said Adin Woods.",

Can you give any information about it?” “Just after you left your seat the man that sat behind you rose and reaching over for it went to the rear end of the car and got out.” “I wish you had stopped him, madam.” “He was so cool about it that I thought he might be a friend of the young gentleman.” “I didn’t know him. He must have been a thief.” “What was his appearance, madam?” asked the lot agent. “He was a thin, dark complexioned man, with side whiskers coming half way down his cheeks.” “And you say he got out of the rear end of the car?” “He won’t get on the train again,” said the agent turning to Rodney. “He thinks the casket valuable enough to pay him for the interruption of his journey.” “What shall I do then?” asked Rodney, feeling helpless and at a loss which way to turn. “Follow him,” said the agent briefly. “He will probably stop over in the village a day and resume his journey tomorrow.” “Even if I found him I am afraid I shouldn’t know how to deal with him.” “Then I’ll tell you what I’ll do.",

I’ve had a spite against thieves ever since I had a valuable overcoat stolen in one of my journeys.” “I shall feel very much obliged to you, Mr. Woods, but won’t it interfere with your business?” “Not materially. If we succeed in overhauling the rascal I shall feel sufficiently repaid for the small interruption. But come on, we can’t afford to linger here while he is carrying off the plunder.” “I don’t know how I can repay you, Mr. Woods,” said Rodney gratefully. “You can buy a lot of me when you get rich enough.” “I will certainly do so, though I am afraid it will be a long time first.” “You don’t know what good fortune may be in store for you. Did you notice, madam, in which direction the thief went?” “Yes, I was looking out of the window. He went over the road to the left.” “That leads to the village. You will see, Mr. Ropes, that I was right about his plans.” “Don’t call me Mr. Ropes. Call me Rodney.” “I will. It don’t seem natural to dub a boy Mr. Now, Rodney, follow me.” The two passengers set out on the road that led to the village. They could see the latter easily, for it was not more than a mile away. “He will be surprised to think we have ‘struck his trail’ so quick,” said the agent. “Where shall we go first?” “To the hotel if there is one.” “The village seems small.” “Yes, there are only a few hundred inhabitant probably.",

However, I think we shall be able to balk his little game.” Ten minutes’ walk brought them to the village. Looking about they saw a small hotel just across the way from a neat white chapel. “Follow me,” said the agent. They went into the public room in which there was a small office. The book of arrivals was open, and Adin Woods went forward and examined it. Silently he pointed to a name evidently just written, for the ink was scarcely dry. This was the name: Louis Wheeler, Philadelphia. “This may or may not be his real name,” said Mr. Woods in a low voice. “Do you wish to register, gentlemen?” asked the clerk. “We will take dinner, and if we decide to stay will register later. By the way, I recognize this name, but it may not be the man I suppose.” “Yes, the gentleman just registered.” “Would you mind describing him?” “He was a tall, dark man as near as I can remember.” “And he carried a small casket in his hand?” “Yes, and a gripsack.” “Oh yes,” said the agent his face lighting up with satisfaction. “It is the man I mean--where is he now?”",

He stole the casket, which contains valuable jewelry, from my young friend here. We are here to demand a return of the property or to arrest him. Is there a policeman within call?” “I can summon a constable.” “Do so, but don’t breathe a word of what I have told you.” The clerk called a boy in from the street and gave him instructions in a low voice. He went at once on his errand, and in ten minutes a stout broad shouldered man made his appearance. “This gentleman sent for you, Mr. Barlow,” said the clerk. “What can I do for you?” asked the constable. “Help me to recover stolen property.” “That I will do with pleasure if you will tell me what you want me to do.” Adin Woods held a brief conference with the constable, then he led the way up stairs, followed immediately by Rodney, while the constable kept a little behind. “His room is No. 9,” said the bell boy. The agent paused before the door of No. 9, and knocked. “Come in!” said a voice. The agent opened the door, and entered, accompanied by Rodney.",

Louis Wheeler changed color, for he recognized both the agent and Rodney. “What is your business?” he asked in a tone which he tried to make indifferent. “That,” answered Woods, pointing to the jewel casket on the bureau. It looked to him as if Wheeler, if that was his name, had been trying to open it. “I don’t understand.” “Then I will try to make things clear to you. You have, doubtless by accident” he emphasized the last word, “taken from the car a casket belonging to my young friend here.” “You are mistaken, sir,” said Wheeler with brazen hardihood. “That casket belongs to me.” “Indeed. What does it contain?” “I fail to see how that is any of your business,” returned Wheeler, determined, if possible, to bluff off his visitors. “I admire your cheek, sir. I really do. But I am too old a traveler to be taken in by such tricks. I propose to have that casket.” “Well, sir, you are the most impudent thief and burglar I ever met. You break into a gentleman’s room, and undertake to carry off his private property. Unless you go out at once, I will have you arrested.” “That you can do very readily, for I have an officer within call.” Louis Wheeler changed color. He began to see that the situation was getting serious. “There is a great mistake here,” he said.",

If he will peacefully restore to my young friend here yonder jewel casket I am willing to let him go. Otherwise--” and he glanced at Wheeler significantly. “Perhaps I have made a mistake,” admitted the thief. “I had a casket exactly like this. Possibly I have taken the wrong one.” “I have the key to the casket here,” said Rodney, “and I can tell you without opening it what it contains.” “What did yours contain?” asked the agent. “Jewelry,” answered Wheeler shortly. “Never mind. I am inclined to think this casket belongs to the boy.” “Rodney, you can take it and Mr. Wheeler will probably find his where he left it.” No objection was made, and the discomfited thief was left a prey to mortification and disappointment. Rodney handed a dollar to the constable which that worthy official received with thanks, and he and the agent resumed their journey by an afternoon train. They saw nothing further of Louis Wheeler who sent for dinner to be served in his room. A YOUNG FINANCIAL WRECK. “You have been very fortunate in recovering your jewels,” said the agent. “I owe it to you,” replied Rodney gratefully. “Well, perhaps so. If I have rendered you a service I am very glad.” “And I am very glad to have found so good a friend.",

The interruption of our journey won’t invalidate the ticket we have.” An hour later they reached New York. “What are your plans, Rodney?” asked Adin Woods, who by this time had become quite intimate with his young companion. “I shall call on my guardian, and perhaps he may give me some advice as to what I do. Where would you advise me to go--to a hotel?” “No; it will be too expensive. I know of a plain boarding house on West Fourteenth Street where you can be accommodated with lodging and two meals--breakfast and supper, or dinner as we call it here--for a dollar a day.” “I shall be glad to go there, for the present, at least. I haven’t much money, and must find something to do as soon as possible.” “We will both go there, and if you don’t object we will take a room together. That will give us a larger apartment. Mrs. Marcy is an old acquaintance of mine, and will give you a welcome.” Rodney was glad to accept his companion’s proposal. They proceeded at once to the boarding house, and fortunately found a good room vacant on the third floor. Mr. Woods went out in the evening to make a call, but Rodney was glad to go to bed at nine o’clock. The next morning after breakfast Rodney consulted his companion as to what he should do with the casket. “Do you want to raise money on it?” asked the agent. “No; I shall not do this unless I am obliged to.” “Have you any idea as to the value of the jewels?”",

Afterwards I advise you to deposit the casket at a storage warehouse, or get Tiffany to keep it for you.” “I will do as you suggest.” Maiden Lane is a street largely devoted to jewelers, wholesale and retail. Rodney followed Mr. Woods into a store about midway between Broadway and Nassau Street. A pleasant looking man of middle age greeted the agent cordially. “What can I do for you?” he asked. “Do you wish to buy a diamond ring for the future Mrs. Woods?” “Not much. I would like to have you appraise some jewelry belonging to my young friend here.” The casket was opened, and the jeweler examined the contents admiringly. “This is choice jewelry,” he said. “Does your friend wish to sell?” “Not at present,” answered Rodney. “When you do give me a call. I will treat you fairly. You wish me to appraise these articles?” “Yes, sir, if you will.” “It will take me perhaps fifteen minutes.” The jeweler retired to the back part of the store with the casket. In about a quarter of an hour he returned. “Of course I can’t give exact figures,” he said, “but I value the jewelry at about twelve hundred dollars.” Rodney looked surprised. “I didn’t think it so valuable,” he said. “I don’t mean that you could sell it for so much, but if you wish to dispose of it I will venture to give you eleven hundred.” “Thank you.",

Now I shall have to leave you, as I have some business to attend to. We will meet at supper.” Rodney decided to call at the office of his late guardian, Benjamin Fielding.

Yesterday it was discovered that he had left the city, but where he has gone is unknown. It is believed that he is very deeply involved, and seeing no way out of his embarrassment has skipped to Canada, or perhaps taken passage to Europe. Probably his creditors will appoint a committee to look into his affairs and report what can be done. LATER--An open letter has been found in Mr. Fielding’s desk, addressed to his creditors. It expresses regret for their losses, and promises, if his life is spared, and fortune favors him, to do all in his power to make them good. No one doubts Mr. Fielding’s integrity, and regrets are expressed that he did not remain in the city and help unravel the tangle in which his affairs are involved. He is a man of ability, and as he is still in the prime of life, it may be that he will be able to redeem his promises and pay his debts in full, if sufficient time is given him. “I can get no help or advice from Mr. Fielding,” thought Rodney. “I am thrown upon my own resources, and must fight the battle of life as well as I can alone.” He got out in front of the Astor House. As he left the car he soiled his shoes with the mud so characteristic of New York streets. “Shine your boots?” asked a young Arab, glancing with a business eye at Rodney’s spattered shoes.",

While Rodney was talking with Mike Flynn he was an object of attention to a man who stood near the corner of Barclay Street, and was ostensibly looking in at the window of the drug store. As Rodney turned away he recognized him at once as his enterprising fellow traveler who had taken possession of the casket of jewels. He did not care to keep up an acquaintance with him, and started to cross the street. But the other came forward smiling, and with a nod said: “I believe you are the young man I met yesterday in the cars and afterwards at Kentville?” “I just wanted to tell you that I had got back my jewel box, the one for which I mistook yours.” “Indeed!” said Rodney, who did not believe a word the fellow said. “Quite an amusing mistake, I made.” “It might have proved serious to me.” “Very true, as I shouldn’t have known where to find you to restore your property.” “I don’t think that would have troubled you much,” thought Rodney. “Where did you find your box?” he asked. “In the car. That is, the conductor picked it up and left it at the depot for me. Where are you staying here in the city? At the Astor House?” “No, I have found a boarding house on West Fourteenth Street.” “If it is a good place, I should like to go there. What is the number?” “I can’t recall it, though I could find it,” answered Rodney with reserve, for he had no wish to have his railroad acquaintance in the house. “Is the gentleman who was traveling with you there also?”",

Why, I venture to say that my box is more valuable than yours.” “Very likely,” said Rodney coldly. “Good morning.” “Good morning. I hope we may meet again.” Rodney nodded, but he could not in sincerity echo the wish. He was now confronted by a serious problem. He had less than ten dollars in his pocketbook, and this would soon be swallowed up by the necessary expenses of life in a large city. What would he do when that was gone? It was clear that he must go to work as soon as possible. If his guardian had remained in the city, probably through his influence a situation might have been secured. Now nothing was to be looked for in that quarter. He bought a morning paper and looked over the Want Column. He found two places within a short distance of the Astor House, and called at each. One was in a railroad office. “My boy,” said the manager, a pleasant looking man, “the place was taken hours since. You don’t seem to get up very early in the morning.” “I could get up at any hour that was necessary,” replied Rodney, “but I have only just made up my mind to apply for a position.” “You won’t meet with any luck today. It is too late. Get up bright and early tomorrow morning, buy a paper, and make early application for any place that strikes you as desirable.” “Thank you, sir.

All at once his arm was grasped, and a cheery voice said, “Where are you going, Rodney?” “Mr. Woods!” he exclaimed, with pleased recognition. “Yes, it’s your old friend Woods.” “You are not the only railroad friend I have met this morning.” “The gentleman who obligingly took care of my jewel box for a short time.” “You don’t mean to say you have met him?

When I came to New York at the age of twenty two I had only fifty dollars. That small sum had to last me twelve weeks. You can judge that I didn’t live on the fat of the land during that time. I couldn’t often eat at Delmonico’s. Even Beefsteak John’s would have been too expensive for me. However, those old days are over.” The next day and the two following Rodney went about the city making application for positions, but every place seemed full. On the third day Mr. Woods said, “I shall have to leave you for a week or more, Rodney.” “Where are you going?” “To Philadelphia. There’s a man there who is a capitalist and likes land investments. I am going to visit him, and hope to sell him several lots. He once lived in this city, so he won’t object to New York investments.” “I hope you will succeed, Mr. Woods. I think if you are going away I had better give up the room, and find cheaper accommodations. I am getting near the end of my money.” “You are right. It is best to be prudent.” That evening Rodney found a room which he could rent for two dollars a week. He estimated that by economy he could get along for fifty cents a day for his eating, and that would be a decided saving. He was just leaving the house the next morning, gripsack in hand, when on the steps he met Louis Wheeler, his acquaintance of the train.",

Boys born and bred in New York have within my observation tried for months to secure a position in vain, so it is not surprising that Rodney who was a stranger proved equally unsuccessful. Though naturally hopeful Rodney became despondent. “There seems to be no place for me,” he said to himself. “When I was at boarding school I had no idea how difficult it is for a boy to earn a living.” He had one resource. He could withdraw the box of jewels from Tiffany’s, and sell some article that it contained. But this he had a great objection to doing. One thing was evident however, he must do something. His friend, the lot agent, was out of town, and he hardly knew whom to advise with. At last Mike Flynn, the friendly bootblack, whose acquaintance he had made in front of the Astor House, occurred to him. Mike, humble as he was, was better off than himself. Moreover he was a New York boy, and knew more about “hustling” than Rodney did. So he sought out Mike in his “office.” “Good morning, Mike,” said Rodney, as the bootblack was brushing off a customer. “Oh, its you, Rodney,” said Mike smiling with evident pleasure. “How you’re gettin’ on?” “That’s bad.

He was a stout man with a kindly face, and Rodney felt that he would prove to be a friend. “Mr. O’Connor, let me introduce me friend, Mr. Rodney Ropes,” said Mike. “Could you give me a lodging?” asked Rodney in an embarrassed tone. “Yes; but I am surprised to see a boy of your appearance here.” “I am surprised to be here myself,” admitted Rodney. The superintendent fixed upon him a shrewd, but kindly glance. “Have you run away from home?” he asked. “No, sir. It is my home that has run away from me.” “Do you come from the country?” “Where have you been living?” “At a boarding school a few hours from New York.” “Why did you leave it?” “Because my guardian sent me word that he had lost my fortune, and could no longer pay my bills.” “You have been unfortunate truly. What do you propose to do now?” “Earn my living if I can. I have been in the city for about two weeks, and have applied at a good many places but in vain.” “Then you were right in coming here.",

Mike, you can take Rodney with you.” Within five minutes Rodney was standing at a long table with a bowl of coffee and a segment of bread before him. It wouldn’t have been attractive to one brought up to good living, as was the case with him, but he was hungry. He had eaten nothing since morning except an apple which he had bought at a street stand for a penny, and his stomach urgently craved a fresh supply of food. Mike stood next to him. The young bootblack, who was used to nothing better, ate his portion with zest, and glanced askance at Rodney to see how he relished his supper. He was surprised to see that his more aristocratic companion seemed to enjoy it quite as much as himself. “I didn’t think you’d like it,” he said. “Anything tastes good when you’re hungry, Mike.”",

I’d have stood treat at de Boss Tweed eatin’ house.” “I had money, but I didn’t dare to spend it. I was afraid of having nothing left.” When Rodney had eaten his supper he felt that he could have eaten more, but the craving was satisfied and he felt relieved. He looked around him with some curiosity, for he had never been in such a motley gathering before. There were perhaps one hundred and fifty boys recruited from the street, to about all of whom except himself the term street Arab might be applied. The majority of them had the shrewd and good humored Celtic face. Many of them were fun loving and even mischievous, but scarcely any were really bad. Naturally Rodney, with his good clothes, attracted attention. The boys felt that he was not one of them, and they had a suspicion that he felt above them. “Get on to de dude!” remarked one boy, who was loosely attired in a ragged shirt and tattered trousers. “He means me, Mike,” said Rodney with a smile. “I say, Patsy Glenn, what do you mean by callin’ me friend Rodney a dude?” demanded Mike angrily. “Coz he’s got a dandy suit on.” “What if he has? Wouldn’t you wear one like it if you could!” “Then just let him alone! He’s just got back from de inauguration.” “Where’d you pick him up, Mike?” “Never mind! He’s one of us.

That turned the tide in favor of Rodney, the boys gathered around him and he told his story in a few words. “I used to be rich, boys,” he said, “but my guardian spent all my money, and now I am as poor as any of you.” “You’d ought to have had me for your guardian, Rodney,” observed Mike. “I wish you had. You wouldn’t have lost my money for me.” “True for you! I say so, boys, if we can find Rodney’s guardian, what’ll we do to him?” “Give him de grand bounce,” suggested Patsy. “Drop him out of a high winder,” said another. “I don’t care to tell you, boys. He’s written me a letter, saying he will try to pay me back some day. I think he will. He isn’t a bad man, but he has been unlucky.” Mike, at the request of Mr. O’Connor, showed Rodney a locker in which he could store such articles of clothing as he had with him. After that he felt more at home, and as if he were staying at a hotel though an humble one. At eight o’clock some of the boys had already gone to bed, but Mike and Rodney were among those who remained up. Rodney noticed with what kindness yet fairness the superintendent managed his unruly flock. Unruly they might have been with a different man, but he had no trouble in keeping them within bounds. It was at this time that two strangers were announced, one a New York merchant named Goodnow, the other a tall, slender man with sandy whiskers of the mutton chop pattern.",

It was only within a short time that I learned from my guardian that it was lost. I left the boarding school where I was being educated, and came to the city to try to make a living.” “But surely your guardian would try to provide for you?” “He is no longer in the city.” “Who was he?” asked Otis Goodnow. “Mr. Benjamin Fielding.” “Is it possible? Why, I lost three thousand dollars by him. He has treated you shamefully.” “It was not intentional, I am sure,” said Rodney. “He was probably drawn into using my money by the hope of retrieving himself. He wrote me that he hoped at some time to make restitution.” “You speak of him generously, my lad,” said Mr. Mulgrave. “Yet he has brought you to absolute poverty.” “Yes, sir, and I won’t pretend that it is not a hard trial to me, but if I can get a chance to earn my own living, I will not complain.” “Goodnow, a word with you,” said the Englishman, and he drew his friend aside. “Can’t you make room for this boy in your establishment?” Otis Goodnow hesitated. “At present there is no vacancy,” he said. “Make room for him, and draw upon me for his wages for the first six months.” “I will do so, but before the end of that time I am sure he will justify my paying him out of my own pocket.” There was a little further conference, and then the two gentlemen came up to where Rodney was standing with Mr.",

It is one of the rules of the Lodging House for the boys to rise at six o’clock, and after a frugal breakfast of coffee and rolls they are expected to go out to their business whatever it may be. Mike and Rodney dispensed with the regulation breakfast and went out to a restaurant on Park Row where they fared better. “Now where shall we go for a room?” asked Rodney. “There’s a feller I know has a good room on Bleecker Street,” said Mike. “A little more’n a mile.” “All right! Let us go and see.” Bleecker Street once stood in better repute than at present. It is said that A. T. Stewart once made his home there. Now it is given over to shops and cheap lodging houses.

I don’t expect to have so easy or pleasant a time as I had at school, but I hope to get on, and some time--perhaps in the summer--to make you a short visit. Yours truly, RODNEY ROPES. THE FIRST DAY AT WORK. A little before half past nine Rodney paused in front of a large five story building on Reade Street occupied by Otis Goodnow. He entered and found the first floor occupied by quite a large number of clerks and salesmen, and well filled with goods. “Well, young fellow, what can I do for you?” asked a dapper looking clerk. “I would like to see Mr. Goodnow.” “He’s reading his letters. He won’t see you.” “Do you decide who is to see him?” he asked. “You’re impudent, young feller.” “Am I? Perhaps you will allow Mr. Goodnow to see me, as long as he told me to call here this morning.” “That’s a different thing,” returned the other in a different tone. “If you’re sure about that you can go to the office in the back part of the room.” Rodney followed directions and found himself at the entrance of a room which had been partitioned off for the use of the head of the firm. Mr. Goodnow was seated at a desk with his back to him, and was employed in opening letters.",

I promised my friend Mulgrave that I would give you a place. What can you do? Are you a good writer?” “Shall I give you a specimen of my handwriting?” “Yes; sit down at that desk.” It was a desk adjoining his own. Rodney seated himself and wrote in a firm, clear, neat hand: “I will endeavor to give satisfaction, if you are kind enough to give me a place in your establishment.” Then he passed over the paper to the merchant. “Ah, very good!” said Mr. Goodnow approvingly. “You won’t be expected to do any writing yet but I like to take into my store those who are qualified for promotion.” He rang a little bell on his desk. A boy about two years older than Rodney answered the summons. “Send Mr. James here,” said the merchant. Mr. James, a sandy complexioned man, partially bald, made his appearance. “Mr. James,” said the merchant, “I have taken this boy into my employ. I don’t know if one is needed, but it is at the request of a friend. You can send him on errands, or employ him in any other way.” “Very well, sir.

They were places not far away, and fortunately Rodney had a general idea as to where they were. In his search for positions he had made a study of the lower part of the city which now stood him in good stead. As he walked towards the door he attracted the attention of the young clerk with whom he had just spoken. “Well, did you see Mr. Goodnow?” asked the young man, stroking a sickly looking mustache. “Has he taken you into the firm?” “Not yet, but he has given me a place.” “So you are one of us?” he said. “Yes,” answered Rodney with a smile. “Then you ought to know the rules of the house.” “You can tell me later on, but now I am going out on an errand.” In about an hour Rodney returned. He had been detained at two of the places where he called. “Do you remember what I said?” asked the young clerk as he passed. “The first rule of the establishment is for a new hand to treat ME on his first day.” “That’s pretty good for you,” said Rodney, laughing; “I shall have to wait till my pay is raised.” About the middle of the afternoon, as Rodney was helping to unpack a crate of goods, the older boy whom he had already seen in the office below, walked up to him and said, “Is your name Ropes?”",

In reply Rodney repeated the first line of the Iliad. “Astonishing!” exclaimed Mr. Mulgrave, putting up his eyeglass, and surveying Rodney as if he were a curious specimen. “You don’t happen to know anything of Sanscrit, do you?” “No, sir; I confess my ignorance.” “I apprehend you won’t require it in my friend Goodnow’s establishment.” “If I do, I will learn it,” said Rodney, rather enjoying the joke.",

He felt, too, that he ought to change it out of regard for Rodney, who was now his close companion. “If I had ten dollars ahead,” he said one day, “I’d give up blackin’ boots.” “What else would you do?” “I’d be a telegraph boy.

Here are ten dollars for you.” “Oh, thank you, ma’am! you’re a gentleman,” said Mike overjoyed. “No, I don’t mean that but I hope you’ll soon get a handsome husband.” “My young friend, I don’t care to marry, though I appreciate your good wishes. I am an old maid from principle. I am an officer of the Female Suffrage Association.” “Is it a good payin’ office, ma’am?” asked Mike, visibly impressed. “No, but it is a position of responsibility. Please tell me your name that I may make a note of it.” “My name is Michael Flynn.” “I see. You are of Celtic extraction.” “I don’t know, ma’am. I never heard that I was. It isn’t anything bad, is it?” “Not at all.",

   "text": "There chanced to be a special demand for telegraph boys at that time, and Mike, who was a sharp lad, on passing the necessary examination, was at once set to work. He was immensely fond of his blue uniform when he first put it on, and felt that he had risen in the social scale. True, his earnings did not average as much, but he was content with smaller pay, since the duties were more agreeable. In the evenings under Rodney’s instruction he devoted an hour and sometimes two to the task of making up the deficiencies in his early education. These were extensive, but Mike was naturally a smart boy, and after a while began to improve rapidly. So three months passed. Rodney stood well in with Mr. Goodnow, and was promoted to stock clerk. The discipline which he had revived as a student stood him in good stead, and enabled him to make more rapid advancement than some who had been longer in the employ of the firm. In particular he was promoted over the head of Jasper Redwood, a boy two years older than himself, who was the nephew of an old employee who had been for fifteen years in the house. Jasper’s jealousy was aroused, and he conceived a great dislike for Rodney, of which Rodney was only partially aware. For this dislike there was really no cause. Rodney stood in his way only because Jasper neglected his duties, and failed to inspire confidence. He was a boy who liked to spend money and found his salary insufficient, though he lived with his uncle and paid but two dollars a week for his board. “Uncle James,” he said one day, “when do you think I will get a raise?” “You might get one now if it were not for the new boy.”",

It was an unlucky day for you when he got a place in the establishment.” “Did you ask Mr. Goodnow to promote me?” “Yes, but he said he had decided to give Archer’s place to Ropes.” Archer was a young clerk who was obliged, on account of pulmonary weakness, to leave New York and go to Southern California. “How much does Ropes get now?” “Seven dollars a week.” “And I only get five, and I am two years older. They ought to have more regard for you, Uncle James, or I, as your nephew, would get promoted.” “I will see what we can do about it.” “I wish Ropes would get into some scrape and get discharged.” It was a new idea, but Jasper dwelt upon it, and out of it grew trouble for Rodney. James Redwood was summoned one morning to the counting room of his employer. “Mr. Redwood,” said the merchant “I have reason to think that one of my clerks is dishonest.” “That is what I want you to find out.” “What reason have you for suspecting any one?” “Some ladies’ cloaks and some dress patterns are missing.” “Are you sure they were not sold?” “Yes: the record of sales has been examined, and they are not included.” “That is strange, Mr. Goodnow,” said Redwood thoughtfully. “I hope I am not under suspicion.” “The losses seem to have taken place in my department.” “True, but that doesn’t involve you.” “What do you want me to do?” “Watch those under you.",

Some articles are missing that have not been sold.” “Ladies’ cloaks and dress patterns.” “Who told you?” asked Jasper in a low tone. “How should he know?” “I didn’t inquire, and if I had he probably wouldn’t have told me.

We won’t do it immediately, but within a week or two. It would do me good to have him turned out of the store.” Jasper proceeded to explain his idea more fully, and his companion pronounced it very clever. Meanwhile Rodney, not suspecting the conspiracy to deprive him of his place and his good name, worked zealously, encouraged by his promotion, and resolved to make a place for himself which should insure him a permanent connection with the firm. Ten days passed, and Mr. Redwood again received a summons from the office. Entering, he found Mr. Goodnow with a letter in his hand. “Well, Mr. Redwood,” he began, “have you got any clew to the party who has stolen our goods?” “Has any thing been taken since I spoke with you on the subject?” “Not that I am aware of.” “Has any one of the clerks attracted your attention by suspicious conduct?” “No, sir,” answered Redwood, puzzled. “Humph!

I will not tell you how it has come to my knowledge, for I do not want to get any one’s ill will, but I will say, to begin with, that they were taken by one of your employees, and the one, perhaps, that you would least suspect, for I am told that he is a favorite of yours. I may as well say that it is Rodney Ropes. I live near him, and last evening I saw him carry a bundle to his room when he went back from the store. I think if you would send round today when he is out, you would find in his room one or more of the stolen articles. I don’t want to get him into trouble, but I don’t like to see you robbed, and so I tell you what I know. A FRIEND. Mr. Redwood read this letter attentively, arching his brows, perhaps to indicate his surprise. Then he read it again carefully. “What do you think of it?” asked the merchant. “I don’t know,” answered Redwood slowly. “Have you ever seen anything suspicious in the conduct of young Ropes?” “I can’t say I have. On the contrary, he seems to be a very diligent and industrious clerk.” “But about his honesty.” “I fancied him the soul of honesty.” “So did I, but of course we are liable to be deceived. It wouldn’t be the first case where seeming honesty has been a cover for flagrant dishonesty.” “What do you wish me to do, Mr. Goodnow? Shall I send Ropes down to you?” “No; it would only give him a chance, if guilty, to cover up his dishonesty.” “I am ready to follow your instructions.” “Do you know where he lodges?”",

It is just what I should wish my own landlady to do. I will therefore ask you to go up to the room with me to see that all is right.” “That seems all right, sir. In that case I don’t object. Follow me, if you please.” As they entered Rodney’s room Mr. Redwood looked about him inquisitively. One article at once fixed his attention. It was a parcel wrapped in brown paper lying on the bed. “This is the parcel, I think,” he said. “If you will allow me I will open it, to make sure.” Mrs. McCarty looked undecided, but as she said nothing in opposition Mr. Redwood unfastened the strings and unrolled the bundle.

Mr. Redwood went back to the store, and went at once to the office. “Well, Redwood,” said Mr. Goodnow, “did you learn anything?” “I went to the lodging of young Ropes, and was admitted to his room.” “And there, wrapped in a brown paper, I found one of our missing cloaks lying on his bed.”",

Rodney reported his return to Mr. Redwood, and in his company went down stairs to the office, with the package under his arm. “Well?” said Mr. Goodnow inquiringly. “This is the package, sir.” “And it was found in your room?” “Yes, sir, I found it on my bed.” “Can’t you account for it being there?” asked the merchant searchingly. “You must admit that its presence in your room looks bad for you.” “I admit it sir; but I had nothing to do with it being there.” “Have you any theory to account for it?” “Only this, that some one must have carried it to my room and placed it where it was found.” “Did you question your landlady as to whether she had admitted any one during the morning?” “Yes, sir. She had not.” “This is very unfavorable to you.” “It makes it probable that you carried in the parcel yourself.” “That I deny,” said Rodney boldly. “I expected you to deny it,” said the merchant coldly. “If this cloak were the only one that had been taken I would drop the matter. But this is by no means the case. Mr. Redwood, can you give any idea of the extent to which we have been robbed?” “So far as I can estimate we have lost a dozen cloaks and about half a dozen dress patterns.” “This is a serious loss, Ropes,” said Mr. Goodnow. “I should think it would foot up several hundred dollars. If you can throw any light upon the thefts, or give me information by which I can get back the goods even at considerable expense, I will be as considerate with you as I can.” “Mr.",

I hope you will investigate, and if you can prove that I took any of the missing articles I want no consideration. I shall expect you to have me arrested, and, if convicted, punished.” “These are brave words, Ropes,” said Mr. Goodnow coldly, “but they are only words. The parcel found in your room affords strong ground for suspicion that you are responsible for at least a part of the thefts. Under the circumstances there is only one thing for me to do, and that is to discharge you.”",

If you should hear anything as to the real robber I will ask you as a favor to communicate with me.” “Mr. Redwood, you have heard the request of Ropes, I will look to you to comply with it.” The merchant turned back to his letters, and Rodney left the office, with what feelings of sorrow and humiliation may be imagined. “I am sorry for this occurrence, Ropes,” said Mr. Redwood, with a touch of sympathy in his voice. “Do you believe me guilty, Mr. Redwood?” “I cannot do otherwise. I hope you are innocent, and, if so, that the really guilty party will be discovered sooner or later.” When they entered the room in which Rodney had been employed Jasper came up, his face alive with curiosity. “Well,” he said, “how did you come out?” “I am discharged,” said Rodney bitterly. “Well, you couldn’t complain of that. Things looked pretty dark for you.” “If I had committed the theft, I would not complain. Indeed, I would submit to punishment without a murmur. But it is hard to suffer while innocent.” “Uncle James,” said Jasper, “if Ropes is going will you ask Mr.",

I don’t want any one to get ahead of me.” James Redwood did not deign a reply. “I am sorry you leave us under such circumstances, Ropes,” he said. “The time may come when you will be able to establish your innocence, and in that case Mr. Goodnow will probably take you back again.” Rodney did not answer, but with his order went to the cashier’s desk and received the four dollars due him. Then, with a heavy heart, he left the store where it had been such a satisfaction to him to work. On Broadway he met his room mate, Mike Flynn, in the uniform of a telegraph boy. “Where are you goin’, Rodney?” asked Mike. “You ain’t let off so early, are you?” “I am let off for good and all, Mike.”",

Some hours later Mike came in, and was told the story. The warm hearted telegraph boy was very angry. “That boss of yours must be a stupid donkey,” he said. “I don’t know. The parcel was found in my room.” “Anybody’d know to look at you that you wouldn’t steal.” “Some thieves look very innocent. The only way to clear me is to find out who left the bundle at the house.” “Doesn’t Mrs. McCarty know anything about it?” “Some one might have got into the house without her knowing anything about it. The lock is a very common one. There are plenty of keys that will open it.” “If we could find some one that saw a person with a bundle go up the steps, that would give us a clew.” “That’s so. We’ll ask.” But for several days no one could be found who had seen any such person. Meanwhile Rodney was at a loss what to do. He was cut off from applying for another place, for no one would engage him if he were refused a recommendation from his late employer. Yet he must obtain some employment for he could not live on nothing. “Do you think, Mike,” he asked doubtfully, “that I could make anything selling papers?” “Such business isn’t for you,” answered the telegraph boy. “But it is one of the few things open to me. I can become a newsboy without recommendations.",

You couldn’t make more’n fifty or sixty cent a day.” “That will be better than nothing.” “And I can pay the rent, or most of it, as I’ll be doin’ better than you.” “We will wait and see how much I make.” So Rodney swallowed his pride, and procuring a supply of afternoon papers set about selling them. He knew that it was an honest business, and there was no disgrace in following it. But one day he was subjected to keen mortification. Jasper Redwood and a friend--it was Philip Carton, his confederate--were walking along Broadway, and their glances fell on Rodney. “I say, Jasper,” said the elder of the two, “isn’t that the boy who was in the same store with you?” Jasper looked, and his eyes lighted up with malicious satisfaction. “Oho!” he said. “Well, this is rich!” “Give me a paper, boy,” he said, pretending not to recognize Rodney at first. “Why, it’s Ropes.” “Yes,” answered Rodney, his cheek flushing. “You see what I am reduced to. What paper will you buy?” “The Mail and Express.”",

It will seem like old times.” “I shall not enter the store till I am able to clear myself of the charge made against me.” “Then probably you will stay away a long time.” “Well, ta, ta! Come along, Philip.” As Rodney followed with his eye the figure of his complacent successor he felt that his fate was indeed a hard one. As Jasper and his companion moved away, Carton said, “I’m sorry for that poor duffer, Jasper.” “Why should you be sorry?” asked Jasper, frowning. “Because he has lost a good place and good prospects, and all for no fault of his own.” “You are getting sentimental, Philip,” sneered Jasper. “No, but I am showing a little humanity. He has lost all this through you----” “Through us, you mean.” “Well, through us. We have made him the scapegoat for our sins.” “Oh well, he is making a living.” “A pretty poor one. I don’t think you would like to be reduced to selling papers.” “His case and mine are different.” “I begin to think also that we have made a mistake in getting him discharged so soon.” “We can’t take anything more.”",

You only have to hand in two dollars a week to your uncle.” “Look here, Philip Carton, I hope you don’t expect to live off me. I have all I can do to take care of myself.” Carton looked at Jasper in anger and mortification. “I begin to understand how good a friend you are,” he said. “I am not fool enough to pinch myself to keep you,” said Jasper bluntly. “You are a man of twenty five and I am only a boy.

I have only two dollars in my pocket, and I have none to spare.” “Humph! what is that?” Philip Carton’s eyes were fixed upon the sidewalk.

You have more money than I.” “Yes, and I mean to keep it myself. You have set me the example.” “Come, Philip, you are not angry at my refusing you a loan?” “No; I think you were sensible. I shall follow your example. I will bid you good night. I seem to be in luck, and will try my fortune at the gaming table.” “I will go with you.” “No; I would prefer to go alone.” “That fellow is unreasonable,” muttered Jasper, as he strode off, discontented. “Did he expect I would divide my salary with him?” Philip Carton, after he parted company with Jasper, walked back to where Rodney was still selling papers. “Give me a paper,” he said. “Which will you have?” “I am not particular. Give me the first that comes handy. Ah, the Evening Sun will do.” He took the paper and put a quarter into Rodney’s hand. As he was walking away Rodney called out, “Stop, here’s your change,” “Never mind,” said Philip with a wave of the hand. “Thank you,” said Rodney gratefully, for twenty five cents was no trifle to him at this time. “That ought to bring me luck,” soliloquized Philip Carton as he walked on. “It isn’t often I do a good deed. It was all the money I had besides the five dollar bill, and I am sure the news boy will make better use of it than I would.” “That was the young man that was walking with Jasper,” reflected Rodney.",

That is encouraging.” Several days passed that could not be considered lucky. Rodney’s average profits were only about fifty cent a day, and that was barely sufficient to buy his meals. It left him nothing to put towards paying room rent. He began to consider whether he would not be compelled to pawn some article from his wardrobe, for he was well supplied with clothing, when he had a stroke of luck. On Fifteenth Street, by the side of Tiffany’s great jewelry store, he picked up a square box neatly done up in thin paper. Opening it, he was dazzled by the gleam of diamonds. The contents were a diamond necklace and pin, which, even to Rodney’s inexperienced eyes, seemed to be of great value. “Some one must have dropped them in coming from the jewelry store,” he reflected. “Who can it be?” He had not far to seek.

I shall carry her good news.” The house he found to be between Fortieth and Fiftieth Street. Ascending the steps he rang the bell. The door was opened by a man servant. “Does Mrs. Harvey live here?” asked Rodney. “What do you want with her, young man?” demanded the servant in a tone of importance. “That I will tell her.” “I can give you my name, but she won’t recognize it.” “Then you don’t know her.” “If it’s money you want, she don’t give to beggars.” “You are impudent,” said Rodney hotly. “If you don’t give my message you will get into trouble.” The servant opened his eyes. He seemed somewhat impressed by Rodney’s confident tone. “Mrs. Harvey doesn’t live here,” he said. “Is she in the house?” “Well, yes, she’s visiting here.” “Then why do you waste your time?” said Rodney impatiently. He forgot for the time that he was no longer being educated at an expensive boarding school, and spoke in the tone he would have used before his circumstances had changed. “I’ll go and ask if she’ll see you,” said the flunky unwillingly.

I will only say that you are as likely to take up the business as I.” “How do you know but I have?” “Because you were selling papers yesterday and are walking the street today.” “That is true. But I have a place engaged for all that. I shall go to work on Monday.” Jasper pricked up his ears. “Where is it?” he asked. “I don’t care to tell at present.” “Is it true? Have you got a place?” “I don’t see how you could. Mr. Goodnow wouldn’t give you a recommendation.” “There is no reason why he should not.” “What, after your taking cloaks and dress patterns from the store?” “I did nothing of the kind. Sooner or later Mr. Goodnow will find out his mistake. Probably the real thief is still in his employ.” Jasper turned pale and regarded Rodney searchingly, but there was nothing in his manner or expression to indicate that his remark had been personal. He thought it best to turn the conversation. “How much pay do you get--four dollars?” “You don’t get as much as you did at our store?” Now it was Jasper’s turn to show surprise. He did not know whether to believe Rodney or not, but there was something in his face which commanded belief.",

The salary was fixed by my employer.” “Who did you say it was?” Jasper’s cunning scheme was defeated. He felt disturbed to hear of Rodney’s good fortune, but he had a shot in reserve. “I don’t think you will keep your place long,” he said in a malicious tone. “Your employer will hear under what circumstances you left our store, and then of course he will discharge you.” “You will be sorry for that won’t you?” asked Rodney pointedly. “Why of course I don’t want you to have bad luck.” “Thank you. You are very considerate.” “Suppose you lose your place, shall you go back to selling papers?” “I hope to find something better to do.” “Where are you going now?” “So am I. Suppose we go together.” “Very well, providing you will lunch with me.” “I don’t want to impose upon you.” “You won’t. We may not meet again for some time, and we shall have this meal to remind us of each other.” They went to a well known restaurant on Park Row. Rodney ordered a liberal dinner for himself, and Jasper followed his example nothing loath. He was always ready to dine at the expense of others, but even as he ate he could not help wondering at the strange chance that had made him the guest of a boy who was selling papers the day before.",

Jasper lost no time in acquainting his uncle with Rodney’s extraordinary good fortune. James Redwood was surprised, but not all together incredulous. “I don’t understand it,” he said, “but Ropes appears to be a boy of truth. Perhaps he may have exaggerated the amount of his salary.” “I hardly think so, uncle. He gave me a tip top dinner down on Park Row.” “He may have been in funds from selling the articles taken from the store.” “That’s so!” assented Jasper, who had the best possible reason for knowing that it was not so. “I wish the boy well,” said his uncle. “He always treated me respectfully, and I never had anything against him except the loss of stock, and it is not certain that he is the thief.” “I guess there isn’t any doubt about that.” “Yet, believing him to be a thief, you did not hesitate to accept a dinner from him.” “I didn’t want to hurt his feelings,” replied Jasper, rather sheepishly. “Do you know what sort of a place he has got, or with what house?” “No; he wouldn’t tell me.” “He thought perhaps you would inform the new firm of the circumstances under which he left us. I don’t blame him, but I am surprised that he should have been engaged without a recommendation.” “Shall you tell Mr. Goodnow?” “Not unless he asks about Ropes.",

   "text": "I don’t want to interfere with the boy in any way.” In the store, as has already been stated, Jasper succeeded to Rodney’s place, and in consequence his pay was raised to seven dollars a week. Still it was not equal to what it had been when he was receiving additional money from the sale of the articles stolen by Philip Carton and himself. The way in which they had operated was this: Philip would come in and buy a cloak or a dress pattern from Jasper, and the young salesman would pack up two or three instead of one. There was a drawback to the profit in those cases, as Carton would be obliged to sell both at a reduced price. Still they had made a considerable sum from these transactions, though not nearly as much as Mr. Goodnow had lost. After the discovery of the theft and the discharge of Rodney, the two confederates felt that it would be imprudent to do any more in that line. This suspension entailed heavier loss on Carton than on Jasper. The latter had a fixed income and a home at his uncle’s house, while Philip had no regular income, though he occasionally secured a little temporary employment. In the meantime Rodney had commenced his tutorship. His young pupil became very fond of him, and being a studious boy, made rapid progress in his lessons. Mr. Sargent felt that his experiment, rash as it might be considered, vindicated his wisdom by its success. At the end of a month he voluntarily raised Rodney’s salary to twenty dollars a week.",

I prize that even more than the higher salary.” Only a portion of Rodney’s time was spent in teaching. In the afternoon he and his charge went on little excursions, generally to Central Park. One holiday, about four months after the commencement of Rodney’s engagement, he was walking in the Park when he fell in with Jasper. Jasper’s attention was at once drawn to the little boy, whose dress and general appearance indicated that he belonged to a wealthy family. This excited Jasper’s curiosity. “How are you, Rodney?” said Jasper adroitly. “It is a good while since I met you.”",

Jasper’s eyes gleamed with sudden intelligence. So this was Rodney’s secret, and this was the position for which he was so well paid. Rodney bit his lip in vexation, but made no remark. “Does he ever punish you for not getting your lessons?” asked Jasper without much tact. “Of course not,” answered Arthur indignantly. “Arthur always does get his lessons,” said Rodney. “I suppose you have a holiday from work today, Jasper.” “Yes; I am glad to get away now and then.” “I must bid you good morning now.” “Won’t you let me call on you? Where do you live, Arthur?” The boy gave the number of his house. Jasper asked Arthur, thinking rightly that he would be more likely to get an answer from him than from Rodney. He walked away triumphantly, feeling that he had made a discovery that might prove of advantage to him. “Is that a friend of yours, Rodney?” asked little Arthur. “I have known him for some time.” “I don’t like him very much.” “Why?” asked Rodney with some curiosity. “I don’t know,” answered the little boy slowly.",

The intimacy between them had perceptibly fallen off. It had grown out of business considerations. Now that it was no longer safe to abstract articles from the store, Jasper felt that he had no more use for his late confederate. When they met he treated him with marked coldness. On this particular day Carton was looking quite shabby. In fact, his best suit was in pawn, and he had fallen back on one half worn and soiled. “Hello!” exclaimed Jasper, and was about to pass on with a cool nod. “Stop!” said Philip, looking offended. “I am in a hurry,” returned Jasper. “I can’t stop today.” “You are in a hurry, and on a holiday?” “Yes; I am to meet a friend near the lake.” “I’ll go along with you.” Jasper had to submit though with an ill grace. “Wouldn’t another day do?” “No; the fact is, Jasper, I am in trouble,” “You usually are,” sneered Jasper. “That is so.

The room looked more attractive than formerly. Rodney had bought a writing desk, which stood in the corner, and had put up three pictures, which, though cheap, were attractive. “Good evening, Jasper,” he said. “It is quite friendly of you to call.” “I hadn’t anything else on hand this evening, and thought I would come round see how you were getting along.” “Take a seat and make yourself at home.” “Do you object to cigarettes?” asked Jasper, producing one from a case in his pocket. “I object to smoking them myself, but I don’t want to dictate to my friends.” “You look quite comfortable here,” continued Jasper in a patronizing tone. “We try to be comfortable, though our room is not luxurious.” “Who do you mean by ‘we’?",

Before he entered your house he was employed by a firm on Reade Street. He was quite a favorite with his employer, Mr. Otis Goodnow, who promoted him in a short time. All at once it was found that articles were missing from the stock. Of course it was evident that some one of the clerks was dishonest. A watch was set, and finally it was found that Rodney Ropes had taken the articles, and one--a lady’s cloak--was found in his room by a detective. He was discharged at once without a recommendation. For a time he lived by selling papers, but at last he managed to get into your house. I am sure you won’t regard him as fit to educate your little son, though I have no doubt he is a good scholar. But his character is bad--I don’t think he ought to have concealed this from you out of friendship for you, and because I think it is my duty, I take the liberty of writing.

It was certainly a mean thing to plot another’s downfall, but Jasper was quite capable of it. Had he secured the loan he asked he would have been willing to leave Rodney alone, but it would only have been the first of a series of similar applications. It was several days before Jasper had an opportunity of learning whether his malicious plan had succeeded or not. On Sunday forenoon he met Rodney on Fifth Avenue just as the church services were over. He crossed the street and accosted the boy he had tried to injure. “Good morning, Ropes,” he said, examining Rodney’s face curiously to see whether it indicated trouble of any kind. “Good morning!” responded Rodney coolly. “How are you getting along in your place?” “Very well, thank you.” “Shall I find you at your pupil’s house if I call there some afternoon?” “Yes, unless I am out walking with Arthur.” “I wonder whether he’s bluffing,” thought Jasper. “I daresay he wouldn’t tell me if he had been discharged. He takes it pretty coolly.” “How long do you think your engagement will last?” he asked. “I don’t know. I never had a talk with Mr. Sargent on that point.” “Do you still give satisfaction?” Rodney penetrated Jasper’s motives for asking all these questions, and was amused. “I presume if I fail to satisfy Mr. Sargent he will tell me so.” “It would be a nice thing if you could stay there three or four years.” “Yes: but I don’t anticipate it.",

He called out to Jasper as he passed. “Come here, Jasper, I want to talk with you.” Jasper looked at him in a manner far from friendly. “I am in a hurry,” he said. “What hurry can you be in? Come and sit down here. I MUST speak to you.” Jasper did not like his tone, but it impressed him, and he did not dare to refuse. He seated himself beside Philip, but looked at him askance.

Jasper could not forgive Rodney for refusing to lend him money, and Rodney was not likely to forget the anonymous letter by which Jasper had tried to injure him. So three months passed. One day Mr. Sargent arrived at home before it was time for Rodney to leave. “I am glad to see you, Rodney,” said his employer. “I have some news for you which I am afraid will not be entirely satisfactory to you.”",

Now, however, that difficulty has been overcome, and I propose to sail in about two weeks.” “I hope you’ll enjoy your trip, sir.” “Thank you. Of course it will terminate, for a time at least your engagement to teach Arthur.” “I shall be sorry for that, sir, but I am not selfish enough to want you to stay at home on that account.” “I thought you would feel that way. I wish I could procure you another position before I go, but that is uncertain. I shall, however, pay you a month’s salary in advance in lieu of a notice.” “That is very liberal, sir.” “I think it only just. I have been very well pleased with your attention to Arthur, and I know he has profited by your instructions as well as enjoyed your companionship. I hope you have been able to save something.” “Yes, sir, I have something in the Union Dime Savings Bank.” “That’s well. You will remain with me one week longer, but the last week Arthur will need for preparations.” Two weeks later Rodney stood on the pier and watched the stately Etruria steam out into the river. Arthur and his father were on deck, and the little boy waved his handkerchief to his tutor as long as he could see him. Rodney turned away sadly. “I have lost a good situation,” he soliloquized. “When shall I get another?”",

At length he saw an advertisement for an entry clerk in a wholesale house in Church Street. He applied and had the good fortune to please the superintendent. “Where have you worked before?” he asked. “At Otis Goodnow’s, on Reade Street.” “How much were you paid there?” “Seven dollars a week.” “Very well, we will start you on that salary, and see if you earn it.” Rodney was surprised and relieved to find that he was not asked for a recommendation from Mr. Goodnow, knowing that he could not obtain one. He went to work on a Monday morning, and found his duties congenial and satisfactory. Seven dollars a week was small, compared with what he had received as a tutor, but he had about two hundred and fifty dollars in the Union Dime Savings Bank and drew three dollars from this fund every week in order that he might still assist Mike, whose earnings were small. One of his new acquaintances in the store was James Hicks, a boy about a year older than himself. “Didn’t you use to work at Otis Goodnow’s?” asked James one day when they were going to lunch. “I know a boy employed there. He is older than either of us.” “Jasper Redwood. Of course you know him.” “Yes,” answered Rodney with a presentiment of evil. He felt that it would be dangerous to have Jasper know of his present position, but did not venture to give a hint of this to James. His fears were not groundless. Only the day after James met Jasper on the street. “Anything new?” asked Jasper. “Yes; we’ve got one of your old friends in our store.”",

I don’t know.” “If he did, it’s forged.” “Goodnow wouldn’t give him a recommendation.” “Because he discharged Ropes. Do you want to know why?” “For stealing articles from the store.” It was the turn of James Hicks to be surprised. “I can’t believe it,” he said. “Its true. Just mention the matter to Ropes, and you’ll see he won’t deny it.” “I think there must be some mistake about it. Rodney doesn’t look like a fellow that would steal.” “Oh, you can’t tell from appearances--Rogues are always plausible.” “Still mistakes are sometimes made. I’d trust Rodney Ropes sooner than any boy I know.” “You don’t know him as well as I do.” “You don’t like him?” said James shrewdly. “No I don’t. I can’t like a thief.” “You talk as if you had a grudge against him.” “Nothing but his being a thief. Well, what are you going to do about it?” “What I have just told you.” “I don’t feel that I have any call to do anything.” “You ought to tell your employer.” “I am no telltale,” said James scornfully. “Then you will let him stay in the store, knowing him to be a thief?” “I don’t know him to be a thief. If he steals anything it will probably be found out.” Jasper urged James to give information about Rodney, but he steadily refused.",

He was much pleased to learn that Rodney had lost his fine position as tutor, and was now in a place from which he might more easily be ousted. As he could not prevail upon James Hicks to betray Rodney he decided to write an anonymous letter to the firm that employed him. The result was that the next afternoon Rodney was summoned to the office. “Sit down Ropes,” said the superintendent. “For what store did you work before you came into our house?”",

He is a nervous man and rather suspicious. I spoke in your favor but I could not turn him.” “At any rate I am grateful to you for your friendly effort.” The superintendent hesitated a moment, and then said: “Will this discharge seriously embarrass you?

I have enough in the savings bank to last me several months, should I be idle so long.” “I am glad of it. I hope you will remember, my boy, that this is none of my doing. I would gladly retain you. I will say one thing more, should Jasper Redwood ever apply for a situation here, his name will not be considered.” So Rodney found himself again without a position. It seemed hard in view of his innocence, but he had confidence to believe that something would turn up for him as before. At any rate he had enough money to live on for some time. When Mike Flynn learned the circumstances of his discharge he was very angry. “I’d like to meet Jasper Redwood,” he said, his eyes flashing. “If I didn’t give him a laying out then my name isn’t Mike Flynn.” “I think he will get his desert some time, Mickey, without any help from you or me.” “Should hope he will.",

He took a seat at some distance back from the door, and in a desultory way began to look about him. All at once he started in surprise, for in a man sitting in one of the front row of chairs he recognized Louis Wheeler, the railroad thief who had stolen his box of jewelry. Wheeler was conversing with a man with a large flapping sombrero, and whose dress and general appearance indicated that he was a Westerner. Rodney left his seat and going forward sat down in the chair behind Wheeler. He suspected that the Western man was in danger of being victimized.",

I shall really be glad to have my time occupied. You see I am a man of means--my father left me a fortune--and so I am not engaged in any business.” “You are in luck. I was brought up on a farm in Vermont, and had to borrow money to take me to Montana four years ago.” “I hope you prospered in your new home?” “I did. I picked up twenty five thousand dollars at the mines, and doubled it by investment in lots in Helena.” “Very neat, indeed. I inherited a fortune from my father--a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars--but I never made a cent myself. I don’t know whether I am smart enough.” “Come out to Montana and I’ll put you in a way of making some money.” “Really, now, that suggestion strikes me favorably. I believe I will follow your advice. When shall you return to your Western home?” “In about a fortnight I think.” “You must go to the theater tonight. There is a good play on at the Madison Square.” “I don’t mind. When can I get ticket?” “I’ll go and secure some. It is only a few blocks away.” “Do so. How much are the tickets?” “A dollar and a half or two dollars each.” “Here are five dollars, if it won’t trouble you too much.” “My dear friend, I meant to pay for the tickets.",

Jefferson Pettigrew scanned his new acquaintance with interest. He had never before met a man of his type and he looked upon him as a curiosity. He was shrewd, however, and did not propose to let Wheeler know that he understood his character. He resolved for the present to play the part of the bluff and unsuspecting country visitor. “You are very kind, Mr. Wheeler,” he said, “to take so much trouble for a stranger.” “My dear sir,” said Wheeler effusively, “I wouldn’t do it for many persons, but I have taken a fancy to you.” “You don’t mean so?” said Pettigrew, appearing pleased? “Yes, I do, on my honor.” “But I don’t see why you should. You are a polished city gentleman and I am an ignorant miner from Montana.” Louis Wheeler looked complacent when he was referred to as a polished city gentleman. “You do yourself injustice, my dear Pettigrew,” he said in a patronizing manner. “You do indeed.

I shall start for Boston this afternoon by the Fall River boat and I want you to go with me.” “I should enjoy the journey, Mr. Pettigrew.” “Then it is settled. Go home and pack your gripsack. You may be gone three or four days.”",

Everybody predicted that I would fail, and I expect most wanted me to fail.

Outside of these I don’t remember any one who felt an interest in Jefferson Pettigrew.” “You will have the satisfaction of letting them see that they did not do you justice.” “Yes, but I may not tell them--that is none except my true friends. If I did, they would hover round me and want to borrow money, or get me to take them out West with me.",

Maybe we’ll join together and buy a mine.” “Would you mind introducin’ him?” “Not at all,” and thus Rodney became acquainted with quite a number of the Burton young men. He was amused to see with what deference they treated him, but preserved a sober face and treated all cordially, so that he made a favorable impression on those he met.

   "text": "Pettigrew. I can pass my time very well.” Jefferson Pettigrew directed his steps to an old fashioned farmhouse about half a mile from the village. In the rear the roof sloped down so that the eaves were only five feet from the ground. The house was large though the rooms were few in number. In the sitting room sat an old man and his wife, who was nearly as old. It was not a picture of cheerful old age, for each looked sad. The sadness of old age is pathetic for there is an absence of hope, and courage, such as younger people are apt to feel even when they are weighed down by trouble. Cyrus Hooper was seventy one, his wife two years younger. During the greater part of their lives they had been well to do, if not prosperous, but now their money was gone, and there was a mortgage on the old home which they could not pay. “I don’t know whats goin’ to become of us, Nancy,” said Cyrus Hooper. “We’ll have to leave the old home, and when the farm’s been sold there won’t be much left over and above the mortgage which Louis Sheldon holds.” “Don’t you think the squire will give you a little more time, Cyrus?” “No; I saw him yesterday, and he’s sot on buyin’ in the farm for himself. He reckons it won’t fetch more’n eighteen hundred dollars.” “Thats only six hundred over the mortgage.” “It isn’t that Nancy. There’s about a hundred dollars due in interest. We won’t get more’n five hundred dollars.” “Surely, Cyrus, the farm is worth three thousand dollars.” “So it is, Nancy, but that won’t do us any good, as long as no one wants it more’n the squire.” “I wish Jefferson were at home.” “What good would it do?",

   "text": "THE FAILURE OF SQUIRE SHELDON’S PLOT. On the morning of the same day Squire Sheldon sat in his study when the servant came in and brought a card. “It’s a gentleman thats come to see you, sir,” she said. Lemuel Sheldon’s eye brightened when he saw the name, for it was that of a railroad man who was interested in the proposed road from Sherborn. “I am glad to see you, Mr. Caldwell,” he said cordially, rising to receive his guest. “What is the prospect as regards the railroad?” “I look upon it as a certainty,” answered Enoch Caldwell, a grave, portly man of fifty. “And it is sure to pass through our town?” “Yes, I look upon that as definitely decided.” “The next question is as to the route it will take,” went on the squire. “Upon that point I should like to offer a few suggestions.” “I shall be glad to receive them. In fact, I may say that my report will probably be accepted, and I shall be glad to consult you.” “Thank you. I appreciate the compliment you pay me, and, though I say it, I don’t think you could find any one more thoroughly conversant with the lay of the land and the most advisable route to follow. If you will put on your hat we will go out together and I will give you my views.” “I shall be glad to do so.” The two gentlemen took a leisurely walk through the village, going by Cyrus Hooper’s house on the way. “In my view,” said the squire, “the road should go directly through this farm a little to the north of the house.” The squire proceeded to explain his reasons for the route he recommended.",

After all it seems the most natural route.” “I think there can be no doubt on that point. Of course the corporation will be willing to pay a reasonable sum for land taken.” “I think I can promise that, as I shall have an important voice in the matter.” “I see you are a thorough business man,” said the squire. “I hold that it is always best to pursue a liberal policy.” “Quite so. You have no doubt of obtaining the farm?” “But suppose the present owner meets the mortgage?” “He can’t. He is a poor man, and he has no moneyed friends. I confess I was a little afraid that a nephew of his just returned from Montana might be able to help him, but I learn that he has only brought home five hundred dollars while the mortgage, including interest, calls for thirteen hundred.” “Then you appear to be safe. When did you say the matter would be settled?” “This afternoon at two o’clock. You had better stay over and take supper with me. I shall be prepared to talk with you at that time.” From a window of the farmhouse Cyrus Hooper saw Squire Sheldon and his guest walking by the farm, and noticed the interest which they seemed to feel in it.",

In this case the squire is safe to be disappointed, thanks to my young friend, Rodney.” “Its lucky for me, Jefferson, that you came home just the time you did. If you had come a week later it would have been too late.” “Then you don’t think the squire would have relented?” “I know he wouldn’t. I went over a short time since and had a talk with him on the subject. I found he was sot on gettin’ the farm into his own hands.” “If he were willing to pay a fair value it wouldn’t be so bad.” “He wasn’t. He wanted to get it as cheap as he could.” “I wonder,” said Jefferson Pettigrew reflectively, “whether I shall be as hard and selfish if ever I get rich.” “I don’t believe you will, Jefferson. I don’t believe you will. It doesn’t run in the blood.” “I hope not Uncle Cyrus. How long have you known the squire?” “Forty years, Jefferson. He is about ten years younger than I am. I was a young man when he was a boy.” “And you attend the same church?”",

I don’t see much religion in that.” “When a man’s interest is concerned religion has to stand to one side with some people.” It was in a pleasant frame of mind that Squire Sheldon left his house and walked over to the farmhouse which he hoped to own. He had decided to offer eighteen hundred dollars for the farm, which would be five hundred over and above the face of the mortgage with the interest added. This of itelf would give him an excellent profit, but he expected also, as we know, to drive a stiff bargain with the new railroad company, for such land as they would require to use. “Stay here till I come back, Mr. Caldwell,” he said. “I apprehend it won’t take me long to get through my business.” Squire Sheldon knocked at the door of the farmhouse, which was opened to him by Nancy Hooper. “Walk in, squire,” she said. “Is your husband at home, Mrs. Hooper?” “Yes; he is waiting for you.” Mrs. Hooper led the way into the sitting room, where her husband was sitting in a rocking chair. “Good afternoon, Mr. Hooper,” said the squire. “I hope I see you well.” “As well as I expect to be. I’m gettin’ to be an old man.” “We must all grow old,” said the squire vaguely. “And sometimes a man’s latter years are his most sorrowful years.” “That means that he can’t pay the mortgage,” thought Squire Sheldon. “Well, ahem!",

You owe me a large sum in accrued interest.” “But if I make shift to pay this?” “I should say the same. It may as well come first as last. You can’t hold the place, and there is no chance of your being better off by waiting.” “I understand that the new railroad might go through my farm. That would put me on my feet.” “There is no certainty that the road will ever be built. Even if it were, it would not be likely to cross your farm.” “I see, Squire Sheldon, you are bound to have the place.” “There is no need to put it that way, Mr. Hooper. I lent you money on mortgage. You can’t pay the mortgage, and of course I foreclose. However, I will buy the farm and allow you eighteen hundred dollars for it. That will give you five hundred dollars over and above the money you owe me.” “The farm is worth three thousand dollars.” “Nonsense, Mr. Hooper. Still if you get an offer of that sum TODAY I will advise you to sell.” “I certainly won’t take eighteen hundred.” “You won’t?",

Cyrus Hooper’s only answer was to call “Jefferson.” Jefferson Pettigrew entered the room, followed by Rodney. “What does this mean?” asked the squire. “It means, Squire Sheldon,” said Mr. Pettigrew, “that you won’t turn my uncle out of his farm this time. My young friend, Rodney Ropes, has advanced Uncle Cyrus money enough to pay off the mortgage.” “I won’t take a check,” said the squire hastily. “You would have to if we insisted upon it, but I have the money here in bills. Give me a release and surrender the mortgage, and you shall have your money.” It was with a crestfallen look that Squire Sheldon left the farmhouse, though his pockets were full of money. “It’s all up,” he said to his friend Caldwell in a hollow voice. “They have paid the mortgage.” After all the railway did cross the farm, and Uncle Cyrus was paid two thousand dollars for the right of way, much to the disappointment of his disinterested friend Lemuel Sheldon, who felt that this sum ought to have gone into his own pocket.",

He has never received but four hundred dollars a year, yet he has managed to rear a family, but has been obliged to use the strictest economy.” “I am going to call on him, and I shall take the opportunity to make him a handsome present. It will surprise him, and I think it will be the first present of any size that he has received in his pastorate of over forty years. “There he lives!” continued Jefferson, pointing out a very modest cottage on the left hand side of the road. It needed painting badly, but it looked quite as well as the minister who came to the door in a ragged dressing gown. He was venerable looking, for his hair was quite white, though he was only sixty five years old. But worldly cares which had come upon him from the difficulty of getting along on his scanty salary had whitened his hair and deepened the wrinkles on his kindly face. “I am glad to see you, Jefferson,” he said, his face lighting up with pleasure. “I heard you were in town and I hoped you wouldn’t fail to call upon me.” “I was sure to call, for you were always a good friend to me as well as many others.” “I always looked upon you as one of my boys, Jefferson.",

Benjamin is employed in a book store, and Austin wants to go to college, but I don’t see any way to send him, poor boy!” and the minister sighed softly. “Does it cost much to keep a boy in college?” “Not so much as might be supposed. There are beneficiary funds for deserving students, and then there is teaching to eke out a poor young man’s income, so that I don’t think it would cost over a hundred and fifty dollars a year.” “That isn’t a large sum.” “Not in itelf, but you know, Jefferson, my salary is only four hundred dollars a year.",

Both were roughly clad, and if Jasper could have seen Rodney he would have turned up his nose in scorn, for Rodney had all the look of a common miner. It was in Oreville that Mr. Pettigrew had a valuable mining property, on which he employed quite a number of men who preferred certain wages to a compensation depending on the fluctuations of fortune.",

Why I am going to advance you to two hundred and fifty.” “You can’t be in earnest, Mr. Pettigrew?” “That is at the rate of three thousand dollars a year!” “Yes, but you are earning it.” “You know I am only a boy.” “That doesn’t make any difference as long as you understand your business.” “I am very grateful to you, Mr. Pettigrew. My, I can save two hundred dollars a month.” “Do so, and I will find you a paying investment for the money.” “What would Jasper say to my luck?” thought Rodney. Three months passed without any incident worth recording. One afternoon a tall man wearing a high hat and a Prince Albert coat with a paste diamond of large size in his shirt bosom entered the public room of the Miners’ Rest and walking up to the bar prepared to register his name. As he stood with his pen in his hand Rodney recognized him not without amazement. It was Louis Wheeler--the railroad thief, whom he had last seen in New York. As for Wheeler he had not taken any notice of the young clerk, not suspecting that it was an old acquaintance who was familiar with his real character. “Have you just arrived in Montana, Mr.",

As Rodney had not had an opportunity to examine his signature in the register Wheeler looked up in quiet surprise. “Do you know me?” he asked. “Yes; don’t you know me?” “I’ll be blowed if it isn’t the kid,” ejaculated Wheeler. “As I run this hotel, I don’t care to be called a kid.”",

But what brings you out here?” “Business,” answered Wheeler in an important tone. “Are you going to become a miner?” “I may buy a mine if I find one to suit me.” “I am glad you seem to be prospering.” “Can you give me a good room?” “Yes, but I must ask a week’s advance payment.” “Twenty five dollars.” “All right. Here’s the money.” Louis Wheeler pulled out a well filled wallet and handed over two ten dollar bills and a five. “Is that satisfactory?” he asked. “Quite so. You seem better provided with money than when I saw you last.” “True. I was then in temporary difficulty. But I made a good turn in stocks and I am on my feet again.” Rodney did not believe a word of this, but as long as Wheeler was able to pay his board he had no good excuse for refusing him accommodation. “That rascal here!” exclaimed Jefferson, when Rodney informed him of Wheeler’s arrival. “Well, thats beat all! What has brought him out here?” “It may be the same kind of business that he had with me. He will bear watching.” “I agree with you, Mr. Pettigrew.” Louis Wheeler laid himself out to be social and agreeable, and made himself quite popular with the other boarders at the hotel. As Jefferson and Rodney said nothing about him, he was taken at his own valuation, and it was reported that he was a heavy capitalist from Chicago who had come to Montana to buy a mine.",

He expressed his opinion freely in regard to what he saw, and priced one that was for sale at fifty thousand dollars. “I like this mine,” he said, “but I don’t know enough about it to make an offer. If it comes up to my expectations I will try it.” “He must have been robbing a bank,” observed Jefferson Pettigrew. Nothing could exceed the cool assurance with which Wheeler greeted Jefferson and recalled their meeting in New York. “You misjudged me then, Mr. Pettigrew,” he said. “I believe upon my soul you looked upon me as an adventurer--a confidence man.” “You are not far from the truth, Mr. Wheeler,” answered Jefferson bluntly. “Well, I forgive you. Our acquaintance was brief and you judged from superficial impressions.” “Perhaps so, Mr. Wheeler. Have you ever been West before?”",

He hasn’t money enough to buy a mine or a tenth part of it.” “He seems to have money.” “Yes; he may have a few hundred dollars, but mark my words, he hasn’t the slightest intention of buying a mine.” “He has some object in view.” “No doubt! What it is is what I want to find out.” There was another way in which Louis Wheeler made himself popular among the miners of Oreville. He had a violin with him, and in the evening he seated himself on the veranda and played popular tunes. He had only a smattering in the way of musical training, but the airs he played took better than classical music would have done. Even Jefferson Pettigrew enjoyed listening to “Home, Sweet Home” and “The Last Rose of Summer,” while the miners were captivated by merry dance tunes, which served to enliven them after a long day’s work at the mines. One day there was a sensation. A man named John O’Donnell came down stairs from his room looking pale and agitated. “Boys,” he said, “I have been robbed.” Instantly all eyes were turned upon him. “Of what have you been robbed, O’Donnell?” asked Jefferson. “Of two hundred dollars in gold. I was going to send it home to my wife in Connecticut next week.” “When did you miss it?”",

   "text": "MR. WHEELER EXPLAINS. Probably there was no one at the hotel who suspected Louis Wheeler of being a thief except Rodney and Mr. Pettigrew. His action in starting a contribution for John O’Donnell helped to make him popular. He was establishing a reputation quite new to him, and it was this fact probably that made him less prudent than he would otherwise have been. As the loss had been made up, the boarders at the Miners’ Rest ceased to talk of it. But Jefferson and his young assistant did not forget it. “I am sure Wheeler is the thief, but I don’t know how to bring it home to him,” said Jefferson one day, when alone with Rodney. “You might search him.” “Yes, but what good would that do? It might be found that he had money, but one gold coin is like another and it would be impossible to identify it as the stolen property. If O’Donnell had lost anything else except money it would be different. I wish he would come to my chamber.” “Perhaps he would if he thought you were a sound sleeper.” “That is an idea. I think I can make use of it.”. That evening when Wheeler was present Mr. Pettigrew managed to turn the conversation to the subject of sleeping. “I am a very sound sleeper,” he said. “I remember when I was at home sleeping many a time through a severe thunder storm.” “Don’t you sometimes wake up in the middle of the night?” asked Rodney. “Very seldom, if I am in good health.” “Its different with me,” said another of the company.",

I never was robbed in my life.” “How much money have you there?” “I don’t know exactly. Perhaps six hundred dollars,” said Pettigrew in an indifferent tone. Among those who listened to this conversation with interest was Louis Wheeler. Rodney did not fail to see the covetous gleam of his eyes when the gold was displayed. The fact was, that Wheeler was getting short of cash and at the time he took John O’Donnell’s money--for he was the thief--he had but about twenty dollars left, and of this he contributed five to the relief of the man he had robbed. His theft realized him two hundred dollars, but this would not last him long, as the expenses of living at the Miners’ Rest were considerable. He was getting tired of Oreville, but wanted to secure some additional money before he left it. The problem was whom to make his second victim. It would not have occurred to him to rob Jefferson Pettigrew, of whom he stood in wholesome fear, but for the admission that he was an unusually sound sleeper; even then he would have felt uncertain whether it would pay.",

There won’t be much risk about it, for Pettigrew sleeps like a top. I will venture it.” Jefferson Pettigrew’s chamber was on the same floor as his own. It was the third room from No. 17 which Mr. Wheeler occupied. As a general thing the occupants of the Miners’ Rest went to bed early. Mining is a fatiguing business, and those who follow it have little difficulty in dropping off to sleep. The only persons who were not engaged in this business were Louis Wheeler and Rodney Ropes. As a rule the hotel was closed at half past ten and before this all were in bed and sleeping soundly. When Wheeler went to bed he said to himself, “This will probably be my last night in this tavern. I will go from here to Helena, and if things turn out right I may be able to make my stay there profitable. I shan’t dare to stay here long after relieving Pettigrew of his bag of gold.” Unlike Jefferson Pettigrew, Wheeler was a light sleeper. He had done nothing to induce fatigue, and had no difficulty in keeping awake till half past eleven. Then lighting a candle, he examined his watch, and ascertained the time. “It will be safe enough now,” he said to himself. He rose from his bed, and drew on his trousers.",

He was in doubt as to whether he would not be obliged to pick the lock, but on trying the door he found that it was not fastened. He opened it and stood within the chamber. Cautiously he glanced at the bed. Mr. Pettigrew appeared to be sleeping soundly. “It’s all right,” thought Louis Wheeler. “Now where is the bag of gold?” It was not in open view, but a little search showed that the owner had put it under the bed. “He isn’t very sharp,” thought Wheeler. “He is playing right into my hands. Door unlocked, and bag of gold under the bed. He certainly is a very unsuspicious man. However, that is all the better for me. Really there isn’t much credit in stealing where all is made easy for you.” There seemed to be nothing to do but to take the gold from its place of deposit and carry it back to his own room. While there were a good many lodgers in the hotel, there seemed to be little risk about this, as every one was asleep. Of course should the bag be found in his room that would betray him, but Mr. Wheeler proposed to empty the gold coins into his gripsack, and throw the bag out of the window into the back yard. “Well, here goes!” said Wheeler cheerfully, as he lifted the bag, and prepared to leave the chamber.

His pay was large, and enabled him to put away a good sum every month, but his hours were long and he was too closely confined for a boy of his age. At the end of three months he showed this in his appearance. His good friend Pettigrew saw it and said one day, “Rodney, you are looking fagged out. You need a change.” “Does that mean that you are going to discharge me?” asked Rodney, with a smile. “It means that I am going to give you a vacation.” “But what can I do if I take a vacation? I should not like lounging around Oreville with nothing to do.” “Such a vacation would do you no good. I’ll tell you the plan I have for you. I own a small mine in Babcock, about fifty miles north of Oreville. I will send you up to examine it, and make a report to me. Can you ride on horseback?” “That is well, for you will have to make your trip in that way. There are no railroads in that direction, nor any other way of travel except on foot or on horseback. A long ride like that with hours daily in the open air, will do you good. What do you say to it?” “I should like nothing better,” replied Rodney, with his eyes sparkling. “Only, how will you get along without me?” “I have a man in my employ at the mines who will do part of your work, and I will have a general oversight of things. So you need not borrow any trouble on that account.",

Every facility was afforded him to examine into the management of things and he found all satisfactory. This part of his journey, therefore, may be passed over. But his return trip was destined to be more exciting. Riding at an easy jog Rodney had got within fifteen miles of Oreville, when there was an unexpected interruption. Two men started out from the roadside, or rather from one side of the bridle path for there was no road, and advanced to meet him with drawn revolvers. “Halt there!” one of them exclaimed in a commanding tone. Rodney drew bridle, and gazed at the two men in surprise. “What do you want of me?” he asked. “Dismount instantly!” “Why should I? What right have you to interfere with my journey?” “Might gives right,” said one of the men sententiously. “It will be best for you to do as we bid you without too much back talk.” “What are you--highwaymen?” asked Rodney.",

A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.” “How much ransom do you propose to ask?” This Rodney said, thinking that if it were a thousand dollars he might be able to make it good to his friend Jefferson. But he was destined to be disappointed. “Five thousand dollars,” answered the chief speaker. “Five thousand dollars!” ejaculated Rodney in dismay. “Five thousand dollars for a boy like me!” “That is the sum we want.” “If it were one thousand I think you might get it.” “One thousand!” repeated the other scornfully. “That wouldn’t half pay us.” “Then suppose you call it two thousand?” “Then I suppose I must make up my mind to remain a prisoner.” “Five thousand dollars wouldn’t be much to a rich man like Pettigrew. We have inquired, and found out that he is worth at least a hundred thousand dollars.",

We shall manage things in our own way.” Convinced that further discussion would be unavailing, Rodney relapsed into silence, but now his captors proceeded to unfold their plans. One of them procured a bottle of ink, some paper and a pen, and set them on the table. “Come up here, boy, and write to Mr. Pettigrew,” he said in a tone of authority. “What shall I write?” “Tell him that you are a prisoner, and that you will not be released unless he pays five thousand dollars.” “I don’t want to write that. It will be the same as asking him to pay it for me.” “That is what we mean him to understand.”",

Boy, will you do that?” Rodney gave his consent for he was anxious that Mr. Pettigrew should know what had prevented him from coming home when he was expected. “Very well, write! You will know what to say.” Rodney drew the paper to him, and wrote as follows: On my way home I was stopped by two men who have confined me in a cave, and won’t let me go unless a sum of money is paid for my ransom. I don’t know what to do. You will know better than I. RODNEY ROPES. His chief captor took the note and read it aloud. “That will do,” he said. “Now he will believe us when we say that you are in our hands.” He signed to Rodney to rise from the table and took his place. Drawing a pile of paper to him, he penned the following note: Rodney Ropes is in our hands. He wants his liberty and we want money. Send us five thousand dollars, or arrange a meeting at which it can be delivered to us, and he shall go free. Otherwise his death be on your hands. HIS CAPTORS.",

I wasn’t cut out for sober, humdrum life.” “Don’t you think you would have been happier?” “No preaching, kid! I had enough of that when I used to go to church in my old home in Missouri.

Ride to within a mile of Oreville, then tether the horse where he won’t easily be found, and walk over to the mines.

Left to himself, Rodney could think soberly of his plight. He could not foresee whether his captivity would be brief or prolonged. After a time the spirit of curiosity seized him. He felt tempted to explore the cavern in which he was confined. He took a lamp, and followed in a direction opposite to that taken by his captors. The cave he found was divided into several irregularly shaped chambers. He walked slowly, holding up the lamp to examine the walls of the cavern. In one passage he stopped short, for something attracted his attention--something the sight of which made his heart beat quicker and filled him with excitement.",

There was a time, and that not long before, when they would have revealed nothing to Rodney, but since his residence at Oreville he had more than once visited the mines and made himself familiar with surface indications of mineral deposit. He stopped short and scanned attentively the walls of the passage. “If I am not mistaken,” he said to himself, “this will make one of the richest mines in Montana. But after all what good will it do me? Here am I a prisoner, unable to leave the cave, or communicate with my friends. If Mr. Pettigrew knew what I do he would feel justified in paying the ransom these men want.” Rodney wondered how these rich deposits had failed to attract the attention of his captors, but he soon settled upon the conclusion that they had no knowledge of mines or mining, and were ignorant of the riches that were almost in their grasp. “Shall I enlighten them?” he asked himself. It was a question which he could not immediately answer. He resolved to be guided by circumstances. In order not to excite suspicion he retraced his steps to the apartment used by his captors as a common sitting room--carefully fixing in his mind the location of the gold ore.

When Caesar reached the place where he had tethered the horse, he was grievously disappointed at not finding him. One of the miners in roaming about had come upon the animal, and knowing him to be Jefferson Pettigrew’s property, untied him and rode him back to Oreville. The dwarf threw up his hands in dismay. “The horse is gone!” he said in his deep bass voice, “and now I must walk back, ten long miles, and get a flogging at the end for losing time. It’s hard luck,” he groaned. The loss was fortunate for Fred and Otto who would otherwise have found it hard to keep up with the dwarf. Caesar breathed a deep sigh, and then started on his wearisome journey. Had the ground been even it would have troubled him less, but there was a steep upward grade, and his short legs were soon weary. Not so with his pursuers, both of whom were long limbed and athletic. We will go back now to the cave and the captors of Rodney. They waited long and impatiently for the return of their messenger. Having no knowledge of the loss of the horse, they could not understand what detained Caesar. “Do you think the rascal has played us false?” said Roderick. “He would be afraid to.” “This man Pettigrew might try to bribe him. It would be cheaper than to pay five thousand dollars.” “He wouldn’t dare. He knows what would happen to him,” said John grimly. “Then why should he be so long?”",

That is unfortunate; however you may not have been to blame.” Luckily for Caesar the letter which he brought was considered satisfactory, and this palliated his fault in losing the horse. The country was so uneven that the two outlaws did not observe that they were followed, until they came to the entrance of the cave. Then, before opening the door, John looked round and caught sight of Fred and Otto eying them from a little distance. He instantly took alarm. “Look,” he said, “we are followed. Look behind you!” His brother turned and came to the same conclusion. “Caesar,” said Roderick, “did you ever see those men before?”",

The result was that both fell seriously wounded and Caesar set up a howl of dismay, not so much for his masters as from alarm for himself. Fred and Otto came forward, and stood looking down upon the outlaws, who were in the agonies of death. “It was our lives or theirs,” said Fred coolly, for he had been long enough in Montana to become used to scenes of bloodshed. “Yes,” answered Otto. “I think these two men are the notorious Dixon brothers who are credited with a large number of murders.

If you will retain him, Mr. Goodnow, I will guarantee to make up any losses you may incur from him.” “How is this? Are you able to make this guarantee?” “I am worth seventy five thousand dollars in money, besides being owner of a large mining property in Montana.” “This is truly wonderful! And you have accumulated all this since you left my store?”",

It was to save myself, but I see now how meanly I acted.” “That speech has saved you,” said the merchant. “Go back to your work. I will give you another chance.” “Will you take me back also, Mr. Goodnow?” asked Philip Carton. The merchant hesitated. “No, Mr. Carton,” said Rodney. “I will look out for you. I will send you to Montana with a letter to my partner. You can do better there than here.” Tears came into the eyes of the ex-clerk. “Thank you,” he said gratefully. “I should prefer it. I will promise to turn over a new leaf; and justify your recommendation.” “Come to see me this evening at the Fifth Avenue Hotel, and I will arrange matters.” “Shall you stay in the city long, Ropes?” asked the merchant. “Come and dine with me on Tuesday evening.” Later in the day Rodney sought out his old room mate Mike Flynn. He found Mike in a bad case. He had a bad cold, but did not dare to give up work, because he wouldn’t be able to meet his bills. He was still in the employ of the District Telegraph Company. “Give the company notice, Mike,” said Rodney. “Henceforth I will take care of you. You can look upon me as your rich uncle,” he added with a smile. “I will be your servant, Rodney.” “Not a bit of it. You will be my friend. But you must obey me implicitly. I am going to send you to school, and give you a chance to learn something.",

I am awfully shabby.” “You won’t be long. You shall be as well dressed as I am.” A week later the two boys reached the school. It would have been hard for any of Mike’s old friends to recognize him in the handsomely dressed boy who accompanied Rodney. “Really, Mike, you are quite good looking, now that you are well dressed,” said Rodney. “Oh, go away with you, Rodney? It’s fooling me you are!” “Not a bit of it. Now I want you to improve your time and learn as fast as you can.”",

   "text": "A year later Rodney left school, but he kept Mike there two years longer. There had been a great change in the telegraph boy, who was quick to learn. He expects, when he leaves school, to join Rodney in Montana. I will not attempt to estimate Rodney’s present wealth, but he is already prominent in financial circles in his adopted State. Philip Carton is prospering, and is respected by his new friends, who know nothing of his earlier life. As I write, Rodney has received a letter from his old guardian, Benjamin Fielding. The letter came from Montreal. “My dear Rodney,” he wrote. “I have worked hard to redeem the past, and restore to you your fortune. I have just succeeded, and send you the amount with interest. It leaves me little or nothing, but my mind is relieved. I hope you have not had to suffer severely from my criminal carelessness, and that you will live long to enjoy what rightfully belongs to you.” In reply Rodney wrote: “Please draw on me for fifty thousand dollars. I do not need it, and you do. Five years from now, if you can spare the money you may send it to me. Till then use it without interest. I am worth much more than the sum my father intrusted to you for me.” This offer was gratefully accepted, and Mr. Fielding is now in New York, where he is likely to experience a return of his former prosperity. As for Rodney, his trials are over. They made a man of him, and proved a blessing in disguise.",
