   "text": "There, on the borders of a creek that runs into the Yadkin River, in a cabin that was chinked with red mud, I came into the world a subject of King George the Third, in that part of his realm known as the province of North Carolina. The cabin reeked of corn-pone and bacon, and the odor of pelts. It had two shakedowns, on one of which I slept under a bearskin. A rough stone chimney was reared outside, and the fireplace was as long as my father was tall. There was a crane in it, and a bake kettle; and over it great buckhorns held my father’s rifle when it was not in use. On other horns hung jerked bear’s meat and venison hams, and gourds for drinking cups, and bags of seed, and my father’s best hunting shirt; also, in a neglected corner, several articles of woman’s attire from pegs. These once belonged to my mother. Among them was a gown of silk, of a fine, faded pattern, over which I was wont to speculate. The women at the Cross-Roads, twelve miles away, were dressed in coarse butternut wool and huge sunbonnets. But when I questioned my father on these matters he would give me no answers. My father was--how shall I say what he was? To this day I can only surmise many things of him. He was a Scotchman born, and I know now that he had a slight Scotch accent. At the time of which I write, my early childhood, he was a frontiersman and hunter. I can see him now, with his hunting shirt and leggings and moccasins; his powder horn, engraved with wondrous scenes; his bullet pouch and tomahawk and hunting knife.",

These lapses of my father’s were a perpetual source of wonder to me,--and, I must say, of delight. They occurred only when a passing traveller who hit his fancy chanced that way, or, what was almost as rare, a neighbor. Many a winter night I have lain awake under the skins, listening to a flow of language that held me spellbound, though I understood scarce a word of it. “Virtuous and vicious every man must be, Few in the extreme, but all in a degree.” The chance neighbor or traveller was no less struck with wonder. And many the time have I heard the query, at the Cross-Roads and elsewhere, “Whar Alec Trimble got his larnin’?” The truth is, my father was an object of suspicion to the frontiersmen. Even as a child I knew this, and resented it. He had brought me up in solitude, and I was old for my age, learned in some things far beyond my years, and ignorant of others I should have known. I loved the man passionately. In the long winter evenings, when the howl of wolves and “painters” rose as the wind lulled, he taught me to read from the Bible and the “Pilgrim’s Progress.” I can see his long, slim fingers on the page. They seemed but ill fitted for the life he led. The love of rhythmic language was somehow born into me, and many’s the time I have held watch in the cabin day and night while my father was away on his hunts, spelling out the verses that have since become part of my life.",

So I learned to skin a bear, and fleece off the fat for oil with my hunting knife; and cure a deerskin and follow a trail. At seven I even shot the long rifle, with a rest. I learned to endure cold and hunger and fatigue and to walk in silence over the mountains, my father never saying a word for days at a spell. And often, when he opened his mouth, it would be to recite a verse of Pope’s in a way that moved me strangely. For a poem is not a poem unless it be well spoken. In the hot days of summer, over against the dark forest the bright green of our little patch of Indian corn rippled in the wind. And towards night I would often sit watching the deep blue of the mountain wall and dream of the mysteries of the land that lay beyond. And by chance, one evening as I sat thus, my father reading in the twilight, a man stood before us. So silently had he come up the path leading from the brook that we had not heard him. Presently my father looked up from his book, but did not rise. As for me, I had been staring for some time in astonishment, for he was a better-looking man than I had ever seen. He wore a deerskin hunting shirt dyed black, but, in place of a coonskin cap with the tail hanging down, a hat. His long rifle rested on the ground, and he held a roan horse by the bridle.",

My father’s whims were past understanding. But he got up. “Good evening,” said he. The visitor looked a little surprised, as I had seen many do, at my father’s accent. “Neighbor,” said he, “kin you keep me over night?” “Come in,” said my father. We sat down to our supper of corn and beans and venison, of all of which our guest ate sparingly. He, too, was a silent man, and scarcely a word was spoken during the meal. Several times he looked at me with such a kindly expression in his blue eyes, a trace of a smile around his broad mouth, that I wished he might stay with us always. But once, when my father said something about Indians, the eyes grew hard as flint. It was then I remarked, with a boy’s wonder, that despite his dark hair he had yellow eyebrows. After supper the two men sat on the log step, while I set about the task of skinning the deer my father had shot that day. Presently I felt a heavy hand on my shoulder. “What’s your name, lad?” he said.",

He turned to me and laughed gently. “Some day you’ll cross the mountains and skin twenty of an evening,” he said. “Ye’ll make a woodsman sure. You’ve got the eye, and the hand.” This little piece of praise from him made me hot all over. “Game rare?” said he to my father. “None sae good, now,” said my father. “I reckon not. My cabin’s on Beaver Creek some forty mile above, and game’s going there, too.” “Settlements,” said my father. But presently, after a few whiffs of his pipe, he added, “I hear fine things of this land across the mountains, that the Indians call the Dark and Bluidy Ground.” “And well named,” said the stranger. “But a brave country,” said my father, “and all tramped down with game. I hear that Daniel Boone and others have gone into it and come back with marvellous tales. They tell me Boone was there alone three months. He’s saething of a man. D’ye ken him?” The ruddy face of the stranger grew ruddier still. “My name’s Boone,” he said. “What!” cried my father, “it wouldn’t be Daniel?” “You’ve guessed it, I reckon.” My father rose without a word, went into the cabin, and immediately reappeared with a flask and a couple of gourds, one of which he handed to our visitor. “Tell me aboot it,” said he.",

It did not at first flow in a steady stream, for he was not a garrulous man, but my father’s questions presently fired his enthusiasm. I recall but little of it, being so small a lad, but I crept closer and closer until I could touch this superior being who had been beyond the Wall. Marco Polo was no greater wonder to the Venetians than Boone to me. He spoke of leaving wife and children, and setting out for the Unknown with other woodsmen. He told how, crossing over our blue western wall into a valley beyond, they found a “Warrior’s Path” through a gap across another range, and so down into the fairest of promised lands. And as he talked he lost himself in the tale of it, and the very quality of his voice changed. He told of a land of wooded hill and pleasant vale, of clear water running over limestone down to the great river beyond, the Ohio--a land of glades, the fields of which were pied with flowers of wondrous beauty, where roamed the buffalo in countless thousands, where elk and deer abounded, and turkeys and feathered game, and bear in the tall brakes of cane. And, simply, he told how, when the others had left him, he stayed for three months roaming the hills alone with Nature herself. “But did you no’ meet the Indians?” asked my father. “I seed one fishing on a log once,” said our visitor, laughing, “but he fell into the water.",

The critters took away all we had. It was hard,” he added reflectively; “I had staked my fortune on the venter, and we’d got enough skins to make us rich. But, neighbor, there is land enough for you and me, as black and rich as Canaan.” “‘The Lord is my shepherd,’” said my father, lapsing into verse. “‘The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. He leadeth me into green pastures, and beside still waters.’” For a time they were silent, each wrapped in his own thought, while the crickets chirped and the frogs sang. From the distant forest came the mournful hoot of an owl. “And you are going back?” asked my father, presently. “Aye, that I am. There are many families on the Yadkin below going, too. And you, neighbor, you might come with us. Davy is the boy that would thrive in that country.” My father did not answer. It was late indeed when we lay down to rest, and the night I spent between waking and dreaming of the wonderland beyond the mountains, hoping against hope that my father would go. The sun was just flooding the slopes when our guest arose to leave, and my father bade him God-speed with a heartiness that was rare to him. But, to my bitter regret, neither spoke of my father’s going.",

For I had the Land of Promise to dream of, and as I went about my tasks I conjured up in my mind pictures of its beauty. You will forgive a backwoods boy,--self-centred, for lack of wider interest, and with a little imagination. Bear hunting with my father, and an occasional trip on the white mare twelve miles to the Cross-Roads for salt and other necessaries, were the only diversions to break the routine of my days. But at the Cross-Roads, too, they were talking of Kaintuckee. For so the Land was called, the Dark and Bloody Ground. The next year came a war on the Frontier, waged by Lord Dunmore, Governor of Virginia. Of this likewise I heard at the Cross-Roads, though few from our part seemed to have gone to it. And I heard there, for rumors spread over mountains, that men blazing in the new land were in danger, and that my hero, Boone, was gone out to save them. But in the autumn came tidings of a great battle far to the north, and of the Indians suing for peace. The next year came more tidings of a sort I did not understand. I remember once bringing back from the Cross-Roads a crumpled newspaper, which my father read again and again, and then folded up and put in his pocket. He said nothing to me of these things. But the next time I went to the Cross-Roads, the woman asked me:-- “Is your Pa for the Congress?” “What’s that?” said I.",

They were all very natural to me thus. And I remember a battle with one of these urchins in the briers, an affair which did not add to the love of their family for ours. There was no money in that country, and the store took our pelts in exchange for what we needed from civilization. Once a month would I load these pelts on the white mare, and make the journey by the path down the creek. At times I met other settlers there, some of them not long from Ireland, with the brogue still in their mouths. And again, I saw the wagoner with his great canvas-covered wagon standing at the door, ready to start for the town sixty miles away. ‘Twas he brought the news of this latest war. One day I was surprised to see the wagoner riding up the path to our cabin, crying out for my father, for he was a violent man. And a violent scene followed. They remained for a long time within the house, and when they came out the wagoner’s face was red with rage. My father, too, was angry, but no more talkative than usual. “Ye say ye’ll not help the Congress?” shouted the wagoner. “I’ll not,” said my father. “Ye’ll live to rue this day, Alec Trimble,” cried the man. “Ye may think ye’re too fine for the likes of us, but there’s them in the settlement that knows about ye.” With that he flung himself on his horse, and rode away.",

Wearily I tramped back the dozen miles up the creek, beside the mare, carrying my pelts with me; stumbling on the stones, and scratched by the dry briers. For it was autumn, the woods all red and yellow against the green of the pines. I sat down beside the old beaver dam to gather courage to tell my father. But he only smiled bitterly when he heard it. Nor would he tell me what the word aristocrat meant. That winter we spent without bacon, and our salt gave out at Christmas. It was at this season, if I remember rightly, that we had another visitor. He arrived about nightfall one gray day, his horse jaded and cut, and he was dressed all in wool, with a great coat wrapped about him, and high boots. This made me stare at him.

He was a tall, spare man like my father, a Scotchman, but his hair was in a cue. “Come in, Duncan,” said my father, quietly. “Davy, run out for wood.” Loath as I was to go, I obeyed. As I came back dragging a log behind me I heard them in argument, and in their talk there was much about the Congress, and a woman named Flora Macdonald, and a British fleet sailing southward. “We’ll have two thousand Highlanders and more to meet the fleet. And ye’ll sit at hame, in this hovel ye’ve made yeresel” (and he glanced about disdainfully) “and no help the King?” He brought his fist down on the pine boards. “Ye did no help the King greatly at Culloden, Duncan,” said my father, dryly. Our visitor did not answer at once. “The Yankee Rebels ‘ll no help the House of Stuart,” said he, presently. “And Hanover’s coom to stay. Are ye, too, a Rebel, Alec Ritchie?” I remember wondering why he said Ritchie. “I’ll no take a hand in this fight,” answered my father. And that was the end of it. The man left with scant ceremony, I guiding him down the creek to the main trail. He did not open his mouth until I parted with him. “Puir Davy,” said he, and rode away in the night, for the moon shone through the clouds. I remember these things, I suppose, because I had nothing else to think about. And the names stuck in my memory, intensified by later events, until I began to write a diary. And now I come to my travels. As the spring drew on I had had a feeling that we could not live thus forever, with no market for our pelts.

We loaded the white mare with the pelts, and my father wore a woollen suit like that of our Scotch visitor, which I had never seen before. He had clubbed his hair. But, strangest of all, he carried in a small parcel the silk gown that had been my mother’s. We had scant other baggage. We crossed the Yadkin at a ford, and climbing the hills to the south of it we went down over stony traces, down and down, through rain and sun; stopping at rude cabins or taverns, until we came into the valley of another river. This I know now was the Catawba. My memories of that ride are as misty as the spring weather in the mountains. But presently the country began to open up into broad fields, some of these abandoned to pines. And at last, splashing through the stiff red clay that was up to the mare’s fetlocks, we came to a place called Charlotte Town. What a day that was for me! And how I gaped at the houses there, finer than any I had ever dreamed of! That was my first sight of a town. And how I listened open-mouthed to the gentlemen at the tavern! One I recall had a fighting head with a lock awry, and a negro servant to wait on him, and was the principal spokesman. He, too, was talking of war. The Cherokees had risen on the western border. He was telling of the massacre of a settlement, in no mild language.",

The man looked at him with amazement. “Ay?” said he, “I shouldn’t think you’d own it. Damn him,” he cried, “if we catch him we’ll skin him alive.” “I ken Cameron,” my father repeated, “and I’ll gang with you to skin him alive.” The man seized his hand and wrung it. “But first I must be in Charlestown,” said my father. The next morning we sold our pelts. And though the mare was tired, we pushed southward, I behind the saddle. I had much to think about, wondering what was to become of me while my father went to skin Cameron. I had not the least doubt that he would do it. The world is a storybook to a lad of nine, and the thought of Charlestown filled me with a delight unspeakable. Perchance he would leave me in Charlestown. At nightfall we came into a settlement called the Waxhaws. And there being no tavern there, and the mare being very jaded and the roads heavy, we cast about for a place to sleep. The sunlight slanting over the pine forest glistened on the pools in the wet fields.

And again he mightn’t.” He ran ahead, still swinging the pail. And we, following, came at length to a comfortable-looking farmhouse. As we stopped at the doorway a stout, motherly woman filled it.

They put me in mind of the palaces in Bunyan, their windows all golden in the morning sun; and as we jogged ahead, I pondered on the delights within them. I saw gangs of negroes plodding to work along the road, an overseer riding behind them with his gun on his back; and there were whole cotton fields in these domains blazing in primrose flower,--a new plant here, so my father said. He was willing to talk on such subjects. But on others, and especially our errand to Charlestown, he would say nothing. And I knew better than to press him. One day, as we were crossing a dike between rice swamps spread with delicate green, I saw the white tops of wagons flashing in the sun at the far end of it. We caught up with them, the wagoners cracking their whips and swearing at the straining horses. And lo! in front of the wagons was an army,--at least my boyish mind magnified it to such. Men clad in homespun, perspiring and spattered with mud, were straggling along the road by fours, laughing and joking together. The officers rode, and many of these had blue coats and buff waistcoats,--some the worse for wear.",

And then, “Where are you from?” “Upper Yadkin,” answered my father. “And you?” The officer, who was a young man, looked surprised. But then he laughed pleasantly. “We’re North Carolina troops, going to join Lee in Charlestown,” said he. “The British are sending a fleet and regiments against it.” “Oh, aye,” said my father, and would have passed on. But he was made to go before the Colonel, who plied him with many questions. Then he gave us a paper and dismissed us. We pursued our journey through the heat that shimmered up from the road, pausing now and again in the shade of a wayside tree. At times I thought I could bear the sun no longer. But towards four o’clock of that day a great bank of yellow cloud rolled up, darkening the earth save for a queer saffron light that stained everything, and made our very faces yellow. And then a wind burst out of the east with a high mournful note, as from a great flute afar, filling the air with leaves and branches of trees. But it bore, too, a savor that was new to me,--a salt savor, deep and fresh, that I drew down into my lungs. And I knew that we were near the ocean. Then came the rain, in great billows, as though the ocean itself were upon us.",

And my most vivid remembrance is of the great trunks towering half a hundred feet in the air, with a tassel of leaves at the top, which my father said were palmettos. Something lay heavy on his mind. For I had grown to know his moods by a sort of silent understanding. And when the roofs and spires of the town shone over the foliage in the afternoon sun, I felt him give a great sigh that was like a sob. And how shall I describe the splendor of that city? The sandy streets, and the gardens of flower and shade, heavy with the plant odors; and the great houses with their galleries and porticos set in the midst of the gardens, that I remember staring at wistfully. But before long we came to a barricade fixed across the street, and then to another. And presently, in an open space near a large building, was a company of soldiers at drill. It did not strike me as strange then that my father asked his way of no man, but went to a little ordinary in a humbler part of the town. After a modest meal in a corner of the public room, we went out for a stroll. Then, from the wharves, I saw the bay dotted with islands, their white sand sparkling in the evening light, and fringed with strange trees, and beyond, of a deepening blue, the ocean. And nearer,--greatest of all delights to me,--riding on the swell was a fleet of ships.",

My father said this was that the town might be the better defended. We bent our way towards one of the sandy streets where the great houses were. And to my surprise we turned in at a gate, and up a path leading to the high steps of one of these. Under the high portico the door was open, but the house within was dark. My father paused, and the hand he held to mine trembled. Then he stepped across the threshold, and raising the big polished knocker that hung on the panel, let it drop. The sound reverberated through the house, and then stillness. And then, from within, a shuffling sound, and an old negro came to the door. For an instant he stood staring through the dusk, and broke into a cry. “Marse Alec!” he said. “Is your master at home?” said my father. Without another word he led us through a deep hall, and out into a gallery above the trees of a back garden, where a gentleman sat smoking a long pipe. The old negro stopped in front of him. “Marse John,” said he, his voice shaking, “heah’s Marse Alec done come back.” The gentleman got to his feet with a start.",

The grandeur of the place awed me, and well it might. Boylike, I was absorbed in this. Our little mountain cabin would almost have gone into this one room. The candles threw their flickering rays upward until they danced on the high ceiling. Marvel of marvels, in the oval left clear by the heavy, rounded cornice was a picture. The negro set down the candles on the marble top of a table. But the air of the room was heavy and close, and the gentleman went to a window and flung it open. It came down instantly with a crash, so that the panes rattled again. “Curse these Rebels,” he shouted, “they’ve taken our window weights to make bullets.” Calling to the negro to pry open the window with a walking-stick, he threw himself into a big, upholstered chair.",

Had my father left me alone in our cabin for a fortnight, I should not have minded. But here, in this strange house, amid such strange surroundings, I was heartbroken. The old negro was very kind. He led me into a little bedroom, and placing the candle on a polished dresser, he regarded me with sympathy. “So you’re Miss Lizbeth’s boy,” said he. “An’ she dade.

At first he barely glanced at me, and nodded. After a while he stopped, and began to put to me many questions about my life: when and how I had lived. And to some of my answers he exclaimed, “Good God!” That was all. He was a handsome man, with hands like a woman’s, well set off by the lace at his sleeves. He had fine-cut features, and the white linen he wore was most becoming. “David,” said he, at length, and I noted that he lowered his voice, “David, you seem a discreet lad.",

They were lonely days after that for a boy used to activity, and only the damp garden paths and lawns to run on. The creek at the back of the garden was stagnant and marshy when the water fell, and overhung by leafy boughs. On each side of the garden was a high brick wall. And though I was often tempted to climb it, I felt that disobedience was disloyalty to my father. Then there was the great house, dark and lonely in its magnificence, over which I roamed until I knew every corner of it. I was most interested of all in the pictures of men and women in quaint, old-time costumes, and I used during the great heat of the day to sit in the drawing-room and study these, and wonder who they were and when they lived. Another amusement I had was to climb into the deep windows and peer through the blinds across the front garden into the street. Sometimes men stopped and talked loudly there, and again a rattle of drums would send me running to see the soldiers. I recall that I had a poor enough notion of what the fighting was all about. And no wonder. But I remember chiefly my insatiable longing to escape from this prison, as the great house soon became for me. And I yearned with a yearning I cannot express for our cabin in the hills and the old life there. I caught glimpses of the master on occasions only, and then I avoided him; for I knew he had no wish to see me.",

There, indeed, was the fleet, but far away, like toy ships on the water, and the bit of a fort perched on the sandy edge of an island. I spent most of that day there, watching anxiously for some movement. But none came. That night I was again awakened. And running into the gallery, I heard quick footsteps in the garden. Then there was a lantern’s flash, a smothered oath, and all was dark again. But in the flash I had seen distinctly three figures. One was Breed, and he held the lantern; another was the master; and the third, a stout one muffled in a cloak, I made no doubt was my jolly friend.",

The great fire there was cold, and the pots and pans hung neatly on their hooks, untouched that day. I was running through the wet garden, glad to be out in the light, when a sound stopped me. It was a dull roar from the direction of the bay. Almost instantly came another, and another, and then several broke together. And I knew that the battle had begun. Forgetting for the moment my loneliness, I ran into the house and up the stairs two at a time, and up the ladder into the cupola, where I flung open the casement and leaned out. There was the battle indeed,--a sight so vivid to me after all these years that I can call it again before me when I will. The toy men-o’-war, with sails set, ranging in front of the fort. They looked at my distance to be pressed against it.

Why were they not all killed by the shot that fell like hail among them? Yet puff after puff sprang from their guns, and the sound of it was like a storm coming nearer in the heat. But at noon it seemed to me as though some of the ships were sailing. It was true. Slowly they drew away from the others, and presently I thought they had stopped again. Surely two of them were stuck together, then three were fast on a shoal. Boats, like black bugs in the water, came and went between them and the others. After a long time the two that were together got apart and away. But the third stayed there, immovable, helpless. Throughout the afternoon the fight kept on, the little black boats coming and going. I saw a mast totter and fall on one of the ships. I saw the flag shot away from the fort, and reappear again.

I remember that people were gathered in the streets as we passed, making merry, and that they greeted Mr. Lowndes with respect and good cheer. His house, too, was set in a garden and quite as fine as Mr. Temple’s. It was ablaze with candles, and I caught glimpses of fine gentlemen and ladies in the rooms. But he hurried me through the hall, and into a little chamber at the rear where a writing-desk was set. He turned and faced me. “You must be tired, David,” he said.",

Boys are always hungry.” “No, sir,” I answered, off my guard. “Mercy!” he said. “It is a long time since breakfast.” “I had no breakfast, sir.” “Good God!” he said, and pulled the velvet handle of a cord. A negro came. “Is the supper for the guests ready?” “Then bring as much as you can carry here,” said the gentleman. “And ask Mrs. Lowndes if I may speak with her.” Mrs. Lowndes came first. And such a fine lady she was that she frightened me, this being my first experience with ladies. But when Mr. Lowndes told her my story, she ran to me impulsively and put her arms about me. “Poor lad!” she said. “What a shame!” I think that the tears came then, but it was small wonder. There were tears in her eyes, too. Such a supper as I had I shall never forget. And she sat beside me for long, neglecting her guests, and talking of my life. Suddenly she turned to her husband, calling him by name. “He is Alec Ritchie’s son,” she said, “and Alec has gone against Cameron.” Mr. Lowndes did not answer, but nodded. “And must he go to Temple Bow?” “My dear,” said Mr. Lowndes, “I fear it is our duty to send him there.” CHAPTER IV. TEMPLE BOW In the morning I started for Temple Bow on horseback behind one of Mr. Lowndes’ negroes. Good Mrs. Lowndes had kissed me at parting, and tucked into my pocket a parcel of sweetmeats. There had been a few grave gentlemen to see me, and to their questions I had replied what I could.",

And Mr. Lowndes had presently put an end to their talk. “The lad knows nothing, gentlemen,” he had said, which was true. “David,” said he, when he bade me farewell, “I see that your father has brought you up to fear God. Remember that all you see in this life is not to be imitated.” And so I went off behind his negro. He was a merry lad, and despite the great heat of the journey and my misgivings about Temple Bow, he made me laugh. I was sad at crossing the ferry over the Ashley, through thinking of my father, but I reflected that it could not be long now ere I saw him again. In the middle of the day we stopped at a tavern. And at length, in the abundant shade of evening, we came to a pair of great ornamental gates set between brick pillars capped with white balls, and turned into a drive. And presently, winding through the trees, we were in sight of a long, brick mansion trimmed with white, and a velvet lawn before it all flecked with shadows. In front of the portico was a saddled horse, craning his long neck at two panting hounds stretched on the ground. A negro boy in blue clutched the bridle. On the horse-block a gentleman in white reclined. He wore shiny boots, and he held his hat in his hand, and he was gazing up at a lady who stood on the steps above him. The lady I remember as well--Lord forbid that I should forget her.",

Musical it was, yet there seemed no pleasure in it: rather irony, and a great weariness of the amusements of this world: and a note, too, from a vanity never ruffled. It stopped abruptly as the negro pulled up his horse before her, and she stared at us haughtily. “What’s this?” she said. “Pardon, Mistis,” said the negro, “I’se got a letter from Marse Lowndes.” “Mr. Lowndes should instruct his niggers,” she said. “There is a servants’ drive.” The man was turning his horse when she cried: “Hold! Let’s have it.” He dismounted and gave her the letter, and I jumped to the ground, watching her as she broke the seal, taking her in, as a boy will, from the flowing skirt and tight-laced stays of her salmon silk to her high and powdered hair. She must have been about thirty. Her face was beautiful, but had no particle of expression in it, and was dotted here and there with little black patches of plaster. While she was reading, a sober gentleman in black silk breeches and severe coat came out of the house and stood beside her. “Heigho, parson,” said the gentleman on the horse-block, without moving, “are you to preach against loo or lansquenet to-morrow?” “Would it make any difference to you, Mr. Riddle?” Before he could answer there came a great clatter behind them, and a boy of my own age appeared.",

Then she held the sheet out to Mr. Riddle. “A pretty piece of news,” she said languidly. “Read it, Harry.” The gentleman seized her hand instead. The lady glanced at the clergyman, whose back was turned, and shook her head. “How tiresome you are!” she said. “What’s happened?” asked Mr. Riddle, letting go as the parson looked around. “Oh, they’ve had a battle,” said the lady, “and Moultrie and his Rebels have beat off the King’s fleet.” “The devil they have!” exclaimed Mr. Riddle, while the parson started forwards. “Anything more?” “Yes, a little.” She hesitated. “That husband of mine has fled Charlestown. They think he went to the fleet.” And she shot a meaning look at Mr. Riddle, who in turn flushed red. I was watching them. “What!” cried the clergyman, “John Temple has run away?” “Why not,” said Mr. Riddle. “One can’t live between wind and water long. And Charlestown’s--uncomfortable in summer.” At that the clergyman cast one look at them--such a look as I shall never forget--and went into the house.",

And both of you keep out of my sight.” Nick strode up to me. “Don’t mind her. She’s always saying, ‘Keep out of my sight.’” His voice trembled. He took me by the sleeve and began pulling me around the house and into a little summer bower that stood there; for he had a masterful manner. “What’s your name?” he demanded. “David Trimble,” I said. “Have you seen my father in town?” The intense earnestness of the question surprised an answer out of me.",

He was taller than I, and wiry, but not so rugged. Yet there was a look about him that was far beyond his strength. A look that meant, never say die. Curiously, even as I fought desperately I compared him with that other lad I had known, Andy Jackson. And this one, though not so powerful, frightened me the more in his relentlessness. Perhaps we should have been fighting still had not some one pulled us apart, and when my vision cleared I saw Nick, struggling and kicking, held tightly in the hands of the clergyman.

To my amazement the clergyman said quietly:-- “Now what was the trouble, David?” “I’ll not be the one to tell it, sir,” I said, and trembled at my temerity.

Your father went away to join the side he believes in, the side we all believe in--the King’s side.” “Did he ever pretend to like the other side?” asked Nick, quickly. “When you grow older you will know his motives,” answered the clergyman, gently. “Until then; you must trust him.” “You never pretended,” cried Nick. “Thank God I never was forced to do so,” said the clergyman, fervently. It is wonderful that the conditions of our existence may wholly change without a seeming strangeness. After many years only vivid snatches of what I saw and heard and did at Temple Bow come back to me. I understood but little the meaning of the seigniorial life there. My chief wonder now is that its golden surface was not more troubled by the winds then brewing. It was a new life to me, one that I had not dreamed of. After that first falling out, Nick and I became inseparable. Far slower than he in my likes and dislikes, he soon became a passion with me. Even as a boy, he did everything with a grace unsurpassed; the dash and daring of his pranks took one’s breath; his generosity to those he loved was prodigal.

And suddenly there would be a shout, and Mammy’s turban go flying from her woolly head, or Mammy herself would be dragged down from behind and sat upon.

A little white room, unevenly panelled, the silver candlesticks and yellow flames fantastically reflected in the mirrors between the deep windows, and the moths and June-bugs tilting at the lights. We sat at a little mahogany table eating porridge and cream from round blue bowls, with Mammy to wait on us. Sometimes there floated in upon us the hum of revelry from the great drawing-room where Madame had her company. Often the good Mr. Mason would come in to us (he cared little for the parties), and talk to us of our day’s doings. Nick had his lessons from the clergyman in the winter time. Mr. Mason took occasion once to question me on what I knew. Some of my answers, in especial those relating to my knowledge of the Bible, surprised him. Others made him sad. “David,” said he, “you are an earnest lad, with a head to learn, and you will.",

Of its forest and glade, its countless herds of elk and buffalo, its salt-licks and Indians, until we fell asleep from sheer exhaustion. “I will go there,” he cried in the morning, as he hurried into his clothes; “I will go to that land as sure as my name is Nick Temple.

And many days we spent in the wood, playing at hunting game--a poor enough amusement for me, and one that Nick soon tired of. They were thick, wet woods, unlike our woods of the mountains; and more than once we had excitement enough with the snakes that lay there. I believe that in a week’s time Nick was as conversant with my life as I myself. For he made me tell of it again and again, and of Kentucky. And always as he listened his eyes would glow and his breast heave with excitement. “Do you think your father will take you there, David, when he comes for you?” I hoped so, but was doubtful. “I’ll run away with you,” he declared. “There is no one here who cares for me save Mr. Mason and Mammy.” And I believe he meant it. He saw but little of his mother, and nearly always something unpleasant was coupled with his views. Sometimes we ran across her in the garden paths walking with a gallant,--oftenest Mr. Riddle. It was a beautiful garden, with hedge-bordered walks and flowers wondrously massed in color, a high brick wall surrounding it. Frequently Mrs. Temple and Mr. Riddle would play at cards there of an afternoon, and when that musical, unbelieving laugh of hers came floating over the wall, Nick would say:--",

Of all Nick’s escapades,--and he was continually in and out of them,--I recall only a few of the more serious. As I have said, he was a wild lad, sobered by none of the things which had gone to make my life, and what he took into his head to do he generally did,--or, if balked, flew into such a rage as to make one believe he could not live. Life was always war with him, or some semblance of a struggle. Of his many wild doings I recall well the time when--fired by my tales of hunting--he went out to attack the young bull in the paddock with a bow and arrow. It made small difference to the bull that the arrow was too blunt to enter his hide. With a bellow that frightened the idle negroes at the slave quarters, he started for Master Nick. I, who had been taught by my father never to run any unnecessary risk, had taken the precaution to provide as large a stone as I could comfortably throw, and took station on the fence. As the furious animal came charging, with his head lowered, I struck him by a good fortune between the eyes, and Nicholas got over. We were standing on the far side, watching him pawing the broken bow, when, in the crowd of frightened negroes, we discovered the parson beside us. “David,” said he, patting me with a shaking hand, “I perceive that you have a cool head.",

One day a huge Congo chief, not long from Africa, nearly killed an overseer, and escaped to the swamp. As the day fell, we heard the baying of the bloodhounds hot upon his trail.

Thence we felt with our feet for the path across the fields, stumbled over a sty, and took our way through the black woods. I was at home here, and Nick was not to be frightened. At intervals the mournful bay of a bloodhound came to us from a distance. “Suppose we should meet the Congo chief,” said Nick, suddenly. The idea had occurred to me. “She needn’t have been so frightened,” said he, in scornful remembrance of his mother’s actions. We pressed on. Nick knew the path as only a boy can. Half an hour passed.

Once before I tried it on the chief, and he fell down. He thinks I’m a god.” It must have been a weird scene to see the great negro following two boys in the moonlight.

One of our amusements, I recall, was to go to the Congo’s cabin to see him fall on his face, until Mr. Mason put a stop to it. The clergyman let us know that we were encouraging idolatry, and he himself took the chief in hand. Another incident comes to me from those bygone days. The fear of negro insurrections at the neighboring plantations being temporarily lulled, the gentry began to pluck up courage for their usual amusements. There were to be races at some place a distance away, and Nick was determined to go. Had he not determined that I should go, all would have been well. The evening before he came upon his mother in the garden. Strange to say, she was in a gracious mood and alone. “Come and kiss me, Nick,” she said. “Now, what do you want?” “I want to go to the races,” he said. “You have your pony. You can follow the coach.” “David is to ride the pony,” said Nick, generously. “May I go in the coach?” “No,” she said, “there is no room for you.” Nicholas flared up. “Harry Riddle is going in the coach. I don’t see why you can’t take me sometimes. You like him better than me.” The lady flushed very red. “How dare you, Nick!” she cried angrily. “What has Mr. Mason been putting into your head?” “Nothing,” said Nick, quite as angrily.",

The little beast would scarce stand still for me to mount. “You’ll not need the whip with her,” said Nick, and led her around by the side of the house, in view of the portico, and stood there at her bridle. Presently, with a great noise and clatter of hoofs, the coach rounded the drive, the powdered negro coachman pulling up the four horses with much ceremony at the door. It was a wondrous great vehicle, the bright colors of its body flashing in the morning light. I had examined it more than once, and with awe, in the coach-house. It had glass windows and a lion on a blue shield on the door, and within it was all salmon silk, save the painted design on the ceiling. Great leather straps held up this house on wheels, to take the jolts of the road. And behind it was a platform. That morning two young negroes with flowing blue coats stood on it. They leaped to the ground when the coach stopped, and stood each side of the door, waiting for my lady to enter. She came down the steps, laughing, with Mr. Riddle, who was in his riding clothes, for he was to race that day. He handed her in, and got in after her.",

He had let go my bridle, folded his whip in his hand, and with a shout of “Come on, Davy,” he ran for the coach, which was going slowly, caught hold of the footman’s platform, and pulled himself up. What possessed the footman I know not. Perchance fear of his mistress was greater than fear of his young master; but he took the lad by the shoulders--gently, to be sure--and pushed him into the road, where he fell and rolled over. I guessed what would happen. Picking himself up, Nick was at the man like a hurricane, seizing him swiftly by the leg. The negro fell upon the platform, clutching wildly, where he lay in a sheer fright, shrieking for mercy, his cries rivalled by those of the lady within. The coachman frantically pulled his horses to a stand, the other footman jumped off, and Mr. Harry Riddle came flying out of the coach door, to behold Nicholas beating the negro with his riding-whip. “You young devil,” cried Mr. Riddle, angrily, striding forward, “what are you doing?” “Keep off, Harry,” said Nicholas. “I am teaching this nigger that he is not to lay hands on his betters.” With that he gave the boy one more cut, and turned from him contemptuously. “What is it, Harry?” came in a shrill voice from within the coach. “It’s Nick’s pranks,” said Mr.",

You little scoundrel,” cried Mr. Riddle, advancing again, “you’ve frightened your mother nearly to a swoon.” “Serves her right,” said Nick. “What!” cried Mr. Riddle. “Come down from there instantly.” Nick raised his whip. It was not that that stopped Mr. Riddle, but a sign about the lad’s nostrils. “Harry Riddle,” said the boy, “if it weren’t for you, I’d be riding in this coach to-day with my mother. I don’t want to ride with her, but I will go to the races. If you try to take me down, I’ll do my best to kill you,” and he lifted the loaded end of the whip. Mrs. Temple’s beautiful face had by this time been thrust out of the door. “For the love of heaven, Harry, let him come in with us. We’re late enough as it is.” Mr. Riddle turned on his heel. He tried to glare at Nick, but he broke into a laugh instead. “Come down, Satan,” says he. “God help the woman you love and the man you fight.” And so Nicholas jumped down, and into the coach. The footman picked himself up, more scared than injured, and the vehicle took its lumbering way for the race-course, I following. I have seen many courses since, but none to equal that in the gorgeous dress of those who watched. There had been many, many more in former years, so I heard people say. This was the only sign that a war was in progress,--the scanty number of gentry present,--for all save the indifferent were gone to Charlestown or elsewhere.",

Yet so runs the world,--strife at one man’s home, and peace and contentment at his neighbor’s; sorrow here, and rejoicing not a league away. Master Nicholas played one prank that evening that was near to costing dear. My lady Temple made up a party for Temple Bow at the course, two other coaches to come and some gentlemen riding. As Nick and I were running through the paddock we came suddenly upon Mr. Harry Riddle and a stout, swarthy gentleman standing together. The stout gentleman was counting out big gold pieces in his hand and giving them to Mr. Riddle. “Lucky dog!” said the stout gentleman; “you’ll ride back with her, and you’ve won all I’ve got.” And he dug Mr. Riddle in the ribs. “You’ll have it again when we play to-night, Darnley,” answered Mr. Riddle, crossly. “And as for the seat in the coach, you are welcome to it. That firebrand of a lad is on the front seat.” “D--n the lad,” said the stout gentleman. “I’ll take it, and you can ride my horse. He’ll--he’ll carry you, I reckon.” His voice had a way of cracking into a mellow laugh. At that Mr. Riddle went off in a towering bad humor, and afterwards I heard him cursing the stout gentleman’s black groom as he mounted his great horse. And then he cursed the horse as it reared and plunged, while the stout gentleman stood at the coach door, cackling at his discomfiture.",

And Mr. Riddle more than once came near running down my pony on his big charger, and he swore at me roundly, too. That night there was a gay supper party in the big dining room at Temple Bow. Nick and I looked on from the gallery window. It was a pretty sight. The long mahogany board reflecting the yellow flames of the candles, and spread with bright silver and shining dishes loaded with dainties, the gentlemen and ladies in brilliant dress, the hurrying servants,--all were of a new and strange world to me. And presently, after the ladies were gone, the gentlemen tossed off their wine and roared over their jokes, and followed into the drawing-room. This I noticed, that only Mr. Harry Riddle sat silent and morose, and that he had drunk more than the others. “Come, Davy,” said Nick to me, “let’s go and watch them again.” “But how?” I asked, for the drawing-room windows were up some distance from the ground, and there was no gallery on that side. “I’ll show you,” said he, running into the garden. After searching awhile in the dark, he found a ladder the gardener had left against a tree; after much straining, we carried the ladder to the house and set it up under one of the windows of the drawing-room. Then we both clambered cautiously to the top and looked in.",

The little tables were ranged along by the windows, and it chanced that Mr. Harry Riddle sat so close to us that we could touch him. On his right sat Mr. Darnley, the stout gentleman, and in the other seats two ladies. Between Mr. Riddle and Mr. Darnley was a pile of silver and gold pieces. There was not room for two of us in comfort at the top of the ladder, so I gave place to Nick, and sat on a lower rung. Presently I saw him raise himself, reach in, and duck quickly. “Feel that,” he whispered to me, chuckling and holding out his hand. It was full of money. “But that’s stealing, Nick,” I said, frightened. “Of course I’ll give it back,” he whispered indignantly. Instantly there came loud words and the scraping of chairs within the room, and a woman’s scream. I heard Mr. Riddle’s voice say thickly, amid the silence that followed:-- “Mr. Darnley, you’re a d--d thief, sir.” “You shall answer for this, when you are sober, sir,” said Mr. Darnley. Then there came more scraping of chairs, all the company talking excitedly at once. Nick and I scrambled to the ground, and we did the very worst thing we could possibly have done,--we took the ladder away. There was little sleep for me that night. I had first of all besought Nick to go up into the drawing-room and give the money back. But some strange obstinacy in him resisted.",

Breed had whiled away for me one hot morning in Charlestown with an account of the gentry and their doings, many of which he related in an awed whisper that I could not understand. They were wild doings indeed to me. But strangest of all seemed the duels, conducted with a decorum and ceremony as rigorous as the law. “Did you ever see a duel, Breed?” I had asked. “Yessah,” said Breed, dramatically, rolling the whites of his eyes. “Whah? Down on de riveh bank at Temple Bow in de ea’ly mo’nin’! Dey mos’ commonly fights at de dawn.” Breed had also told me where he was in hiding at the time, and that was what troubled me. Try as I would, I could not remember. It had sounded like Clam Shell. That I recalled, and how Breed had looked out at the sword-play through the cracks of the closed shutters, agonized between fear of ghosts within and the drama without. At the first faint light that came into our window I awakened Nick. “Listen,” I said; “do you know a place called Clam Shell?” He turned over, but I punched him persistently until he sat up. “What the deuce ails you, Davy?” he asked, rubbing his eyes. “Have you nightmare?” “Do you know a place called Clam Shell, down on the river bank, Nick?” “Why,” he replied, “you must be thinking of Cram’s Hell.” “What’s that?” I asked.",

With a groan and a shriek it gave way, disclosing the blackness inside. We started back involuntarily. I looked at Nick, and Nick at me. He was very pale, and so must I have been. But such was the respect we each held for the other’s courage that neither dared flinch. And so I walked in, although it seemed as if my shirt was made of needle points and my hair stood on end. The crackings of the old floor were to me like the shots in Charlestown Bay. Our hearts beating wildly, we made our way into a farther room. It was like walking into the beyond. “Is there a window here?” I asked Nick, my voice sounding like a shout. Groping for it, I suddenly received a shock that set me reeling. Human nature could stand no more. We both turned tail and ran out of the house as fast as we could, and stood in the wet grass, panting. Then shame came. “Let’s open the window first,” I suggested. So we walked around the house and pried the solid shutter from its fastenings. Then, gathering our courage, we went in again at the door. In the dim light let into the farther room we saw a four-poster bed, old and cheap, with ragged curtains. It was this that I had struck in my groping. “The chief killed Cram there,” said Nick, in an awed voice, “in that bed.",

The sun peeped over the bank of dense green forest and spread rainbow colors on the still waters of the river. Now and again a fish broke, or a great bird swooped down and slit the surface. A far-off snatch of melody came to our ears,--the slaves were going to work. Nothing more. And little by little grave misgivings gnawed at my soul of the wisdom of coming to this place. Doubtless there were many other spots. “Davy,” said Nick, at last, “I’m sorry I took that money. What are we here for?” “Hush!” I whispered; “do you hear anything?” I did, and distinctly. For I had been brought up in the forest. “I hear voices,” he said presently, “coming this way.” They were very clear to me by then. Emerging from the forest path were five gentlemen. The leader, more plainly dressed than the others, carried a leather case. Behind him was the stout figure of Mr. Darnley, his face solemn; and last of all came Mr. Harry Riddle, very pale, but cutting the tops of the long grass with a switch. Nick seized my arm. “They are going to fight,” said he. “Yes,” I replied, “and we are here to stop them, now.” “No, not now,” he said, holding me still. “We’ll have some more fun out of this yet.”",

The fifth gentleman took a position halfway between the two, and, opening the leather case, laid it down on the grass, where its contents glistened. “That’s Dr. Ball,” whispered Nick. And his voice shook with excitement. Mr. Riddle stripped off his coat and waistcoat and ruffles, and his sword-belt, and Mr. Darnley did the same. Both gentlemen drew their swords and advanced to the middle of the lawn, and stood opposite one another, with flowing linen shirts open at the throat, and bared heads. They were indeed a contrast. Mr. Riddle, tall and white, with closed lips, glared at his opponent. Mr. Darnley cut a merrier figure,--rotund and flushed, with fat calves and short arms, though his countenance was sober enough. All at once the two were circling their swords in the air, and then Nick had flung open the shutter and leaped through the window, and was running and shouting towards the astonished gentlemen, all of whom wheeled to face him. He jingled as he ran. “What in the devil’s name now?” cried Mr. Riddle, angrily. “Here’s this imp again.” Nicholas stopped in front of him, and, thrusting his hand in his breeches pocket, fished out a handful of gold and silver, which he held out to the confounded Mr.",

This piece of information, to Mr. Riddle’s plain discomfiture, was greeted with a roar of laughter, Mr. Darnley himself laughing loudest. Nor were these gentlemen satisfied with that. They crowded around Mr. Riddle and slapped him on the back, Mr. Darnley joining in with the rest. And presently Mr. Riddle flung away his sword, and laughed, too, giving his hand to Mr. Darnley. At length Mr. Darnley turned to Nick, who had stood all this while behind them, unmoved. “My friend,” said he, seriously, “such is your regard for human life, you will probably one day be a pirate or an outlaw. This time we’ve had a laugh. The next time somebody will be weeping. I wish I were your father.” “I wish you were,” said Nick. This took Mr. Darnley’s breath. He glanced at the other gentlemen, who returned his look significantly. He laid his hand kindly on the lad’s head. “Nick,” said he, “I wish to God I were your father.” After that they all went home, very merry, to breakfast, Nick and I coming after them.

Mr. Mason had written it out and that afternoon read over this part of it to Nick. The quotation I recall, having since read it many times, and the gist of it was in this wise:-- “And he said unto him, ‘What thou wilt have thou wilt have, despite the sin of it. Blessed are the stolid, and thrice cursed he who hath imagination,--for that imagination shall devour him. And in thy life a sin shall be presented unto thee with a great longing. God, who is in heaven, gird thee for that struggle, my son, for it will surely come. That it may be said of you, ‘Behold, I have refined thee, but not with silver, I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction.’ Seven days shalt thou wrestle with thy soul; seven nights shall evil haunt thee, and how thou shalt come forth from that struggle no man may know.’” CHAPTER VI. MAN PROPOSES, BUT GOD DISPOSES A week passed, and another Sunday came,--a Sunday so still and hot and moist that steam seemed to rise from the heavy trees,--an idle day for master and servant alike. A hush was in the air, and a presage of we knew not what. It weighed upon my spirits, and even Nick’s, and we wandered restlessly under the trees, seeking for distraction.",

Nick and I were before her, and, running through the house, arrived at the portico in time to see a negro ride up on a horse covered with lather. It was the same negro who had fetched me hither from Mr. Lowndes. And when I saw him my heart stood still lest he had brought news of my father. “What’s to do, boy?” cried Nicholas to him. The boy held in his hand a letter with a great red seal. “Fo’ Mistis Temple,” he said, and, looking at me queerly, he took off his cap as he jumped from the horse. Mistress Temple herself having arrived, he handed her the letter. She took it, and broke the seal carelessly. “Oh,” she said, “it’s only from Mr. Lowndes.

As I lingered a light began to tremble in the heavens. A cock crew in the distance. I sat down on a fallen log to rest. But presently, as the light grew, I heard shouts which drew nearer and deeper and brought me to my feet in an uncertainty of expectation. Next came the rattling of chains, the scramble of hoofs in the mire, and here was a wagon with a big canvas cover. Beside the straining horses was a great, burly man with a red beard, cracking his long whip, and calling to the horses in a strange tongue.

Travelling with incredible slowness, in due time we came to a county called Orangeburg, where all were Dutchmen like Hans, and very few spoke English. And they all thought like Hans, and loved peace, and hated the Congress. On Sundays, as we lay over at the taverns, these would be filled with a rollicking crowd of fiddlers and dancers, quaintly dressed, the women bringing their children and babies. At such times Hans would be drunk, and I would have to feed the tired horses and mount watch over the cargo. I had many adventures, but none worth the telling here. And at length we came to Hans’s farm, in a prettily rolling country on the Broad River. Hans’s wife spoke no English at all, nor did the brood of children running about the house. I had small fancy for staying in such a place, and so Hans paid me two crowns for my three weeks’ service; I think, with real regret, for labor was scarce in those parts, and though I was young, I knew how to work. And I could at least have guided his plough in the furrow and cared for his cattle.",

For the convenience of travellers passing that way, Hans kept a tavern,--if it could have been dignified by such a name. It was in truth merely a log house with shakedowns, and stood across the rude road from his log farmhouse. And he gave me leave to sleep there and to work for my board until I cared to leave. It so chanced that on the second day after my arrival a pack-train came along, guided by a nettlesome old man and a strong, black-haired lass of sixteen or thereabouts. The old man, whose name was Ripley, wore a nut-brown hunting shirt trimmed with red cotton; and he had no sooner slipped the packs from his horses than he began to rail at Hans, who stood looking on. “You damned Dutchmen be all Tories, and worse,” he cried; “you stay here and till your farms while our boys are off in the hill towns fighting Cherokees. I wish the devils had every one of your fat sculps. Polly Ann, water the nags.” Hans replied to this sally with great vigor, lapsing into Dutch. Polly Ann led the scrawny ponies to the trough, but her eyes snapped with merriment as she listened. She was a wonderfully comely lass, despite her loose cotton gown and poke-bonnet and the shoepacks on her feet. She had blue eyes, the whitest, strongest of teeth, and the rosiest of faces. “Gran’pa hates a Dutchman wuss’n pizen,” she said to me.",

I looked for another and mightier explosion from the old backwoodsman, but to my astonishment he seemed to forget Hans’s existence, and turned and smiled on her benevolently. “Polly Ann,” said he, “what be you about now?” “Gran’pa,” said she, “here’s Davy Trimble, who’s a good boy, and his pa is just killed by the Cherokees along with Baskin, and he wants work and a home, and he’s comin’ along with us.” “All right, David,” answered Mr. Ripley, mildly, “ef Polly Ann says so, you kin come.

By daylight we had left Hans and his farm forever. I can see the lass now, as she strode along the trace by the flowing river, through sunlight and shadow, straight and supple and strong. Sometimes she sang like a bird, and the forest rang. Sometimes she would make fun of her grandfather or of me; and again she would be silent for an hour at a time, staring ahead, and then I knew she was thinking of that Tom McChesney. She would wake from those reveries with a laugh, and give me a push to send me rolling down a bank. “What’s the matter, Davy? You look as solemn as a wood-owl.

He must have been an escaped redemptioner, for he wore jauntily a swanskin three-cornered hat and stained breeches of a fine cloth. He was a bold, vain fellow. “My beauty,” says he, as we sat at supper, “silver and Wedgwood better become you than pewter and a trencher.” “And I reckon a rope would sit better on your neck than a ruff,” retorted Polly Ann, while the company shouted with laughter. But he was not the kind to become discomfited. “I’d give a guinea to see you in silk.

We were all silent the rest of the way, climbing the slender trail through the forest over the gap into the next valley. For I was jealous of Tom. I am not ashamed to own it now. In the smoky haze that rises just before night lets her curtain fall, we descended the farther slope, and came to Mr. Ripley’s cabin. CHAPTER VII. IN SIGHT OF THE BLUE WALL ONCE MORE Polly Ann lived alone with her grandfather, her father and mother having been killed by Indians some years before. There was that bond between us, had we needed one. Her father had built the cabin, a large one with a loft and a ladder climbing to it, and a sleeping room and a kitchen. The cabin stood on a terrace that nature had levelled, looking across a swift and shallow stream towards the mountains. There was the truck patch, with its yellow squashes and melons, and cabbages and beans, where Polly Ann and I worked through the hot mornings; and the corn patch, with the great stumps of the primeval trees standing in it. All around us the silent forest threw its encircling arms, spreading up the slopes, higher and higher, to crown the crests with the little pines and hemlocks and balsam fir.",

So one day, when Polly Ann was gone across the ridge, I took down the long rifle from the buckhorns over the hearth, and the hunting knife and powder-horn and pouch beside it, and trudged up the slope to a game trail I discovered. All day I waited, until the forest light grew gray, when a buck came and stood over the water, raising his head and stamping from time to time. I took aim in the notch of a sapling, brought him down, cleaned and skinned and dragged him into the water, and triumphantly hauled one of his hams down the trail. Polly Ann gave a cry of joy when she saw me. “Davy,” she exclaimed, “little Davy, I reckoned you was gone away from us. Gran’pa, here is Davy back, and he has shot a deer.” “You don’t say?” replied Mr. Ripley, surveying me and my booty with a grim smile. “How could you, Gran’pa?” said Polly Ann, reproachfully. “Wal,” said Mr. Ripley, “the gun was gone, an’ Davy. I reckon he ain’t sich a little rascal after all.” Polly Ann and I went up the next day, and brought the rest of the buck merrily homeward.

It was Mr. McChesney, Tom’s father--alone. “No, Polly Ann,” he cried, “there ain’t nuthin’ happened. We’ve laid out the hill towns. But the Virginny men wanted a guide, and Tom volunteered, and so he ain’t come back with Rutherford’s boys.” Polly Ann seized him by the shoulders, and looked him in the face. “Be you tellin’ the truth, Warner McChesney?” she said in a hard voice. “As God hears me,” said Warner McChesney, solemnly. “He sent ye this.” He drew from the bosom of his hunting shirt a soiled piece of birch bark, scrawled over with rude writing. Polly seized it, and flew into the house. The hickories turned a flaunting yellow, the oaks a copper-red, the leaves crackled on the Catawba vines, and still Tom McChesney did not come. The Cherokees were homeless and houseless and subdued,--their hill towns burned, their corn destroyed, their squaws and children wanderers.

Steadying the hood of her sunbonnet with her hand, the girl gazed long and earnestly, and a lump came into my throat at the thought that the comer might be Tom McChesney. Polly Ann sat down at the block again in disgust. “It’s only Chauncey Dike,” she said. “Who’s Chauncey Dike?” I asked. “He reckons he’s a buck,” was all that Polly Ann vouchsafed. Chauncey drew near with a strut. He had very long black hair, a new coonskin cap with a long tassel, and a new blue-fringed hunting shirt.

Polly Ann sauntered down the trail slowly, as was her wont after such an occasion. And the man behind the house twice whispered with extreme caution, “How near is she?” before she came up the path. “Have you been lonesome, Davy?” she said. “No,” said I, “I’ve had a visitor.” “It’s not Chauncey Dike again?” she said. “He doesn’t dare show his face here.” “No, it wasn’t Chauncey. This man would like to have seen you, Polly Ann. He--” here I braced myself,--“he knew Tom McChesney. He called him a good-for-nothing scamp.” “He did--did he!” said Polly Ann, very low. “I reckon it was good for him I wasn’t here.”",

Polly Ann looked at him like a frightened doe. And as she stared, uncertain whether to stay or fly, the color surged into her cheeks and mounted to her fair forehead. “I’ve come back, Polly Ann,” said he. But his voice was not so clear as a while ago. Then Polly Ann surprised me. “What made you come back?” said she, as though she didn’t care a minkskin. Whereat Mr. McChesney shifted his feet. “I reckon it was to fetch you, Polly Ann.” “I like that!” cried she. “He’s come to fetch me, Davy.” That was the first time in months her laugh had sounded natural. “I heerd you fetched one gal acrost the mountains, and now you want to fetch another.” “Polly Ann,” says he, “there was a time when you knew a truthful man from a liar.” “That time’s past,” retorted she; “I reckon all men are liars.

But he had gone no distance at all before Polly Ann, with three springs, was at his shoulder. “Tom!” she said very gently. He hesitated, stopped, thumped the stock of his gun on the ground, and wheeled. He looked at her doubtingly, and her eyes fell to the ground. “Tom McChesney,” said she, “you’re a born fool with wimmen.” “Thank God for that,” said he, his eyes devouring her. “Ay,” said she. And then, “You want me to go to Kaintuckee with you?” “That’s what I come for,” he stammered, his assurance all run away again. “I’ll go,” she answered, so gently that her words were all but blown away by the summer wind. He laid his rifle against a stump at the edge of the corn-field, but she bounded clear of him. Then she stood, panting, her eyes sparkling. “I’ll go,” she said, raising her finger, “I’ll go for one thing.” “What’s that?” he demanded.",

The last I saw of them that day they were going off up the trace towards his mother’s, Polly Ann keeping ahead of him and just out of his reach. And I was very, very happy. For Tom McChesney had come back at last, and Polly Ann was herself once more. As long as I live I shall never forget Polly Ann’s wedding. She was all for delay, and such a bunch of coquetry as I have never seen. She raised one objection after another; but Tom was a firm man, and his late experiences in the wilderness had made him impatient of trifling. He had promised the Kentucky settlers, fighting for their lives in their blockhouses, that he would come back again. And a resolute man who was a good shot was sorely missed in the country in those days.",

Nor would she listen to Tom when he implored her to let him return alone, to come back for her when the redskins had got over the first furies of their hatred. As for me, the thought of going with them into that promised land was like wine. Wondering what the place was like, I could not sleep of nights. “Ain’t you afeerd to go, Davy?” said Tom to me. “You promised Polly Ann to take me,” said I, indignantly. “Davy,” said he, “you ain’t over handsome. ‘Twouldn’t improve yere looks to be bald.

Better stay behind with Gran’pa Ripley till I kin fetch ye both.” “Tom,” said Polly Ann, “you kin just go back alone if you don’t take Davy.” So one of the Winn boys agreed to come over to stay with old Mr. Ripley until quieter times. The preparations for the wedding went on apace that week. I had not thought that the Grape Vine settlement held so many people. And they came from other settlements, too, for news spread quickly in that country, despite the distances. Tom McChesney was plainly a favorite with the men who had marched with Rutherford. All the week they came, loaded with offerings, turkeys and venison and pork and bear meat--greatest delicacy of all--until the cool spring was filled for the feast. From thirty miles down the Broad, a gaunt Baptist preacher on a fat white pony arrived the night before.",

At last, when the sun was over the stream, rose such Indian war-whoops and shots from the ridge trail as made me think the redskins were upon us. The shouts and hurrahs grew louder and louder, the quickening thud of horses’ hoofs was heard in the woods, and there burst into sight of the assembly by the truck patch two wild figures on crazed horses charging down the path towards the house. We scattered to right and left. On they came, leaping logs and brush and ditches, until one of them pulled up, yelling madly, at the very door, the foam-flecked sides of his horse moving with quick heaves. It was Chauncey Dike, and he had won the race for the bottle of “Black Betty,”--Chauncey Dike, his long, black hair shining with bear’s oil. Amid the cheers of the bride’s friends he leaped from his saddle, mounted a stump and, flapping his arms, crowed in victory. Before he had done the vanguard of the groom’s friends were upon us, pell-mell, all in the finest of backwoods regalia,--new hunting shirts, trimmed with bits of color, and all armed to the teeth--scalping knife, tomahawk, and all.",

Peeping out from under it were the little blue-beaded moccasins which Tom himself had brought across the mountains in the bosom of his hunting shirt. Polly Ann was radiant, and yet at times so rapturously shy that when the preacher announced himself ready to tie the knot she ran into the house and hid in the cupboard--for Polly Ann was a child of nature. Thence, coloring like a wild rose, she was dragged by a boisterous bevy of girls in linsey-woolsey to the spreading maple of the forest that stood on the high bank over the stream. The assembly fell solemn, and not a sound was heard save the breathing of Nature in the heyday of her time. And though I was happy, the sobs rose in my throat. There stood Polly Ann, as white now as the bleached linen she wore, and Tom McChesney, tall and spare and broad, as strong a figure of a man as ever I laid eyes on. God had truly made that couple for wedlock in His leafy temple. The deep-toned words of the preacher in prayer broke the stillness. They were made man and wife. And then began a day of merriment, of unrestraint, such as the backwoods alone knows.",

Ay, and wrestling matches in the severe manner of the backwoods between the young bucks, more than one of which might have ended seriously were it not for the high humor of the crowd. Tom McChesney himself was in most of them, a hot favorite. By a trick he had learned in the Indian country he threw Chauncey Dike (no mean adversary) so hard that the backwoods dandy lay for a moment in sleep. Contrary to the custom of many, Tom was not in the habit of crowing on such occasions, nor did he even smile as he helped Chauncey to his feet. But Polly Ann knew, and I knew, that he was thinking of what Chauncey had said to her. So the long summer afternoon wore away into twilight, and the sun fell behind the blue ridges we were to cross. Pine knots were lighted in the big room, the fiddlers set to again, and then came jigs and three and four handed reels that made the puncheons rattle,--chicken-flutter and cut-the-buckle,--and Polly Ann was the leader now, the young men flinging the girls from fireplace to window in the reels, and back again; and",

As long as I live I shall never forget the morning we started on our journey across the Blue Wall. Before the sun chased away the filmy veil of mist from the brooks in the valley, the McChesneys, father, mother, and children, were gathered to see us depart. And as they helped us to tighten the packsaddles Tom himself had made from chosen tree-forks, they did not cease lamenting that we were going to certain death. Our scrawny horses splashed across the stream, and we turned to see a gaunt and lonely figure standing apart against the sun, stern and sorrowful. We waved our hands, and set our faces towards Kaintuckee. Tom walked ahead, rifle on shoulder, then Polly Ann; and lastly I drove the two shaggy ponies, the instruments of husbandry we had been able to gather awry on their packs,--a scythe, a spade, and a hoe. I triumphantly carried the axe. It was not long before we were in the wilderness, shut in by mountain crags, and presently Polly Ann forgot her sorrows in the perils of the trace. Choked by briers and grapevines, blocked by sliding stones and earth, it rose and rose through the heat and burden of the day until it lost itself in the open heights. As the sun was wearing down to the western ridges the mischievous sorrel mare turned her pack on a sapling, and one of the precious bags burst.",

And he told of a deep gorge between towering mountains where a great river cried angrily, of a black cave out of which a black stream ran, where a man could paddle a dugout for miles into the rock. The river was the Tennessee, and the place the resort of the Chickamauga bandits, pirates of the mountains, outcasts of all nations. And Dragging Canoe was their chief.

Ay, north, Davy. I’m hunting for the Nollichucky Trace that leads to the Watauga settlement.” It was wonderful to me how he chose his way through the mountains.

Fear of the Indians, like a dog shivering with the cold, was a deadened pain on the border. Strangely enough it was I who chanced upon the Nollichucky Trace, which follows the meanderings of that river northward through the great Smoky Mountains. It was made long ago by the Southern Indians as they threaded their way to the Hunting Lands of Kaintuckee, and shared now by Indian traders. The path was redolent with odors, and bright with mountain shrubs and flowers,--the pink laurel bush, the shining rhododendron, and the grape and plum and wild crab. The clear notes of the mountain birds were in our ears by day, and the music of the water falling over the ledges, mingled with that of the leaves rustling in the wind, lulled us to sleep at night. High above us, as we descended, the gap, from naked crag to timber-covered ridge, was spanned by the eagle’s flight. And virgin valleys, where future generations were to be born, spread out and narrowed again,--valleys with a deep carpet of cane and grass, where the deer and elk and bear fed unmolested.

And later, when the fireflies glowed and the Nollichucky sang in the darkness, we listened to the talk of the war of the year gone by. I needed not to be told that before me were the renowned leaders of the Watauga settlements. My hero worship cried it aloud within me. These captains dwelt on the border-land of mystery, conquered the wilderness, and drove before them its savage tribes by their might. When they spoke of the Cherokees and told how that same Stuart--the companion of Cameron--was urging them to war against our people, a fierce anger blazed within me.",

I remember the men,--scarcely what they said: Evan Shelby’s words, like heavy blows on an anvil; Isaac Shelby’s, none the less forceful; James Robertson compelling his listeners by some strange power. He was perchance the strongest man there, though none of us guessed, after ruling that region, that he was to repeat untold hardships to found and rear another settlement farther west. But best I loved to hear Captain Sevier, whose talk lacked not force, but had a daring, a humor, a lightness of touch, that seemed more in keeping with that world I had left behind me in Charlestown. Him I loved, and at length I solved the puzzle. To me he was Nick Temple grown to manhood. I slept in the room with Captain Sevier’s boys, and one window of it was of paper smeared with bear’s grease, through which the sunlight came all bleared and yellow in the morning. I had a boy’s interest in affairs, and I remember being told that the gentlemen were met here to discuss the treaty between themselves and the great Oconostota, chief of the Cherokees, and also to consider the policy of punishing once for all Dragging Canoe and his bandits at Chickamauga. As we sat at breakfast under the trees, these gentlemen generously dropped their own business to counsel Tom, and I observed with pride that he had gained their regard during the last year’s war. Shelby’s threats and Robertson’s warnings and Sevier’s exhortations having no effect upon his determination to proceed to Kentucky, they began to advise him how to go, and he sat silent while they talked.",

What do you say to it, Mr. Robertson?” Mr. Robertson leaned his square shoulders over the table. “He may fall in with a party going over,” he answered, without looking up. Polly Ann looked at Tom as if to say that the whole Continental Army could not give her as much protection. We left that hospitable place about nine o’clock, Mr. Robertson having written a letter to Colonel Daniel Boone,--shut up in the fort at Boonesboro,--should we be so fortunate as to reach Kaintuckee: and another to a young gentleman by the name of George Rogers Clark, apparently a leader there. Captain Sevier bowed over Polly Ann’s hand as if she were a great lady, and wished her a happy honeymoon, and me he patted on the head and called a brave lad. And soon we had passed beyond the corn-field into the Wilderness again. Our way was down the Nollichucky, past the great bend of it below Lick Creek, and so to the Great War-path, the trail by which countless parties of red marauders had travelled north and south. It led, indeed, northeast between the mountain ranges. Although we kept a watch by day and night, we saw no sign of Dragging Canoe or his men, and at length we forded the Holston and came to the scattered settlement in Carter’s Valley.",

His brown beard was grown like a bramble patch, his eye had a violet light, and his hunting shirt was in tatters. He was thin to gauntness, ate ravenously of the food that was set before him, and throwing off his soaked moccasins, he spread his scalded feet to the blaze, and the steaming odor of drying leather filled the room. “Whar be ye from?” asked Tom. For answer the man bared his arm, then his shoulder, and two angry scars, long and red, revealed themselves, and around his wrists were deep gouges where he had been bound. “They killed Sue,” he cried, “sculped her afore my very eyes. And they chopped my boy outen the hickory withes and carried him to the Creek Nation.

On Thursday Tom made a trip to the store in the valley, and came back with a Deckard rifle he had bought for the stranger, whose name was Weldon. There was no news from Kaintuckee, but the Carter’s Valley settlers seemed to think that matters were better there. It was that same night, I believe, that two men arrived from Fort Chiswell. One, whose name was Cutcheon, was a little man with a short forehead and a bad eye, and he wore a weather-beaten blue coat of military cut. The second was a big, light-colored, fleshy man, and a loud talker. He wore a hunting shirt and leggings. They were both the worse for rum they had had on the road, the big man talking very loud and boastfully. “Afeard to go to Kaintuckee!” said he. “I’ve met a parcel o’ cowards on the road, turned back. There ain’t nothin’ to be afeard of, eh, stranger?” he added, to Tom, who paid no manner of attention to him. The small man scarce opened his mouth, but sat with his head bowed forward on his breast when he was not drinking. We passed a dismal, crowded night in the room with such companions. When they heard that we were to go over the mountains, nothing would satisfy the big man but to go with us. “Come, stranger,” said he to Tom, “two good rifles such as we is ain’t to be throwed away.” “Why do you want to go over?” asked Tom.",

So we started away from Carter’s Valley on a bright Saturday morning, the grass glistening after a week’s rain, the road sodden, and the smell of the summer earth heavy. Tom and Weldon walked ahead, driving the two horses, followed by Cutcheon, his head dropped between his shoulders. The big man, Riley, regaled Polly Ann. “My pluck is,” said he, “my pluck is to give a redskin no chance. Shoot ‘em down like hogs. It takes a good un to stalk me, Ma’am. Up on the Kanawha I’ve had hand-to-hand fights with ‘em, and made ‘em cry quits.” “Law!” exclaimed Polly Ann, nudging me, “it was a lucky thing we run into you in the valley.” But presently we left the road and took a mountain trail,--as stiff a climb as we had yet had.

At length we came to a cabin on a creek, the corn between the stumps around it choked with weeds, and no sign of smoke in the chimney. Behind it slanted up, in giant steps, a forest-clad hill of a thousand feet, and in front of it the stream was dammed and lined with cane. “Who keeps house?” cried Tom, at the threshold. He pushed back the door, fashioned in one great slab from a forest tree. His welcome was an angry whir, and a huge yellow rattler lay coiled within, his head reared to strike. Polly Ann leaned back. “Mercy,” she cried, “that’s a bad sign.” But Tom killed the snake, and we made ready to use the cabin that night and the next day. For the horses were to be rested and meat was to be got, as we could not use our guns so freely on the far side of Cumberland Gap.

They did not so much as glance at me. Riley held a little back of the two, being the coward. But Cutcheon stood ready, like a wolf. I did not wait for him to spring, but, taking the best aim I could with my two hands, fired. With a curse that echoed in the crags, he threw up his arms and fell forward, writhing, on the turf. “Run for the cabin, Polly Ann,” I shouted, “and bar the door.” There was no need. For an instant Riley wavered, and then fled to the cane. Polly Ann and I went to the man on the ground, and turned him over. His eyes slid upwards. There was a bloody froth on his lips. “Davy!” cried she, awestricken, “Davy, ye’ve killed him!” I grew dizzy and sick at the thought, but she caught me and held me to her. Presently we sat down on the door log, gazing at the corpse. Then I began to reflect, and took out my powder gourd and loaded the pistol. “What are ye a-doing?” she said. “In case the other one comes back,” said I. “Pooh,” said Polly Ann, “he’ll not come back.” Which was true.

Try as we would, we could not get out of our minds the Thing that lay under the oak. It was near sundown when Tom and Weldon appeared on the mountain side carrying a buck between them. Tom glanced from one to the other of us keenly. He was very quick to divine. “Whar be they?” said he. “Show him, Davy,” said Polly Ann. I took him over to the oak, and Polly Ann told him the story. He gave me one look, I remember, and there was more of gratitude in it than in a thousand words. Then he seized a piece of cold cake from the stone. “Which trace did he take?” he demanded of me. But Polly Ann hung on his shoulder. “Tom, Tom!” she cried, “you beant goin’ to leave us again. Tom, he’ll die in the wilderness, and we must git to Kaintuckee.” The next vivid thing in my memory is the view of the last barrier Nature had reared between us and the delectable country. It stood like a lion at the gateway, and for some minutes we gazed at it in terror from Powell’s Valley below. How many thousands have looked at it with sinking hearts! How many weaklings has its frown turned back! There seemed to be engraved upon it the dark history of the dark and bloody land beyond.",

Death, perchance. But Death had been near to all of us, and his presence did not frighten. As we climbed towards the Gap, I recalled with strange aptness a quaint saying of my father’s that Kaintuckee was the Garden of Eden, and that men were being justly punished with blood for their presumption. As if to crown that judgment, the day was dark and lowering, with showers of rain from time to time. And when we spoke,--Polly Ann and I,--it was in whispers. The trace was very narrow, with Daniel Boone’s blazes, two years old, upon the trees; but the way was not over steep. Cumberland Mountain was as silent and deserted as when the first man had known it. Alas, for the vanity of human presage! We gained the top, and entered unmolested. No Eden suddenly dazzled our eye, no splendor burst upon it. Nothing told us, as we halted in our weariness, that we had reached the Promised Land. The mists weighed heavily on the evergreens of the slopes and hid the ridges, and we passed that night in cold discomfort. It was the first of many without a fire. The next day brought us to the Cumberland, tawny and swollen from the rains, and here we had to stop to fell trees to make a raft on which to ferry over our packs. We bound the logs together with grapevines, and as we worked my imagination painted for me many a red face peering from the bushes on the farther shore.",

But not so much as a whimper escaped from Polly Ann. I have often told her since that the sorest trial she had was the guard she kept on her tongue,--a hardship indeed for one of Irish inheritance. Many a pull had she lightened for us by a flash of humor. The next morning the sun relented, and the wine of his dawn was wine indeed to our flagging hopes. Going down to wash at the river’s brink, I heard a movement in the cane, and stood frozen and staring until a great, bearded head, black as tar, was thrust out between the stalks and looked at me with blinking red eyes. The next step revealed the hump of the beast, and the next his tasselled tail lashing his dirty brown quarters. I did not tarry longer, but ran to tell Tom. He made bold to risk a shot and light a fire, and thus we had buffalo meat for some days after. We were still in the mountains. The trail led down the river for a bit through the worst of canebrakes, and every now and again we stopped while Tom and Weldon scouted. Once the roan mare made a dash through the brake, and, though Polly Ann burst through one way to head her off and I another, we reached the bank of Richland Creek in time to see her nose and the top of her pack above the brown water.",

As for me, my heart hammered against my ribs, and I grew sick with listening. It was at that instant that my admiration for Tom McChesney burst bounds, and that I got some real inkling of what woodcraft might be. Stepping silently between the tree trunks, his eyes bent on the leafy loam, he found a footprint here and another there, and suddenly he went into the cane with a sign to us to remain. It seemed an age before he returned. Then he began to rake the ashes, and, suddenly bending down, seized something in them,--the broken bowl of an Indian pipe.",

In company ill at ease, in the forest he became silent and masterful--an unerring woodsman, capable of meeting the Indian on his own footing. And, strangest thought of all, he and many I could name who went into Kentucky, had escaped, by a kind of strange fate, being born in the north of Ireland. This was so of Andrew Jackson himself. The rest of the day he led us in silence down the trace, his eye alert to penetrate every corner of the forest, his hand near the trigger of his long Deckard. I followed in boylike imitation, searching every thicket for alien form and color, and yearning for stature and responsibility. As for poor Weldon, he would stride for hours at a time with eyes fixed ahead, a wild figure,--ragged and fringed.

I had the second, for Tom trusted me now, and glorying in that trust I was alert and vigilant. A shy moon peeped at me between the trees, and was fantastically reflected in the water. The creek rippled over the limestone, and an elk screamed in the forest far beyond.",

I had been dreaming of Nick Temple and Temple Bow, and my father coming back to me there with a great gash in his shoulder like Weldon’s. I lay for a moment dazed by the transition, staring through the gray light. Then I sat up, the soft stamping and snorting of the horses in my ears. The sorrel mare had her nose high, her tail twitching, but there was no other sound in the leafy wilderness. With a bound of returning sense I looked for Weldon. He had fallen asleep on the bank above, his body dropped across the trunk of the oak. I leaped on the trunk and made my way along it, stepping over him, until I reached and hid myself in the great roots of the tree on the bank above. The cold shiver of the dawn was in my body as I waited and listened. Should I wake Tom? The vast forest was silent, and yet in its shadowy depths my imagination drew moving forms. I hesitated. The light grew: the boles of the trees came out, one by one, through the purple. The tangled mass down the creek took on a shade of green, and a faint breath came from the southward. The sorrel mare sniffed it, and stamped. Then silence again,--a long silence. Could it be that the cane moved in the thicket? Or had my eyes deceived me? I stared so hard that it seemed to rustle all over.",

I was thoroughly frightened now,--and yet I had the speculative Scotch mind. The thicket was some one hundred and fifty yards above, and on the flooded lands at a bend. If there were Indians in it, they could not see the sleeping forms of our party under me because of a bend in the stream. They might have seen me, though I had kept very still in the twisted roots of the oak, and now I was cramped. If Indians were there, they could determine our position well enough by the occasional stamping and snorting of the horses. And this made my fear more probable, for I had heard that horses and cattle often warned pioneers of the presence of redskins. Another thing: if they were a small party, they would probably seek to surprise us by coming out of the cane into the creek bed above the bend, and stalk down the creek. If a large band, they would surround and overpower us. I drew the conclusion that it must be a small party--if a party at all. And I would have given a shot in the arm to be able to see over the banks of the creek. Finally I decided to awake Tom. It was no easy matter to get down to where he was without being seen by eyes in the cane. I clung to the under branches of the oak, finally reached the shelving bank, and slid down slowly.",

He glanced then at the restless horses and nodded, pointing up at the sleeping figure of Weldon, in full sight on the log. The Indians must have seen him. Tom picked up the spare rifle. “Davy,” said he, “you stay here beside Polly Ann, behind the oak. You kin shoot with a rest; but don’t shoot,” said he, earnestly, “for God’s sake don’t shoot unless you’re sure to kill.” I nodded. For a moment he looked at the face of Polly Ann, sleeping peacefully, and the fierce light faded from his eyes. He brushed her on the cheek and she awoke and smiled at him, trustfully, lovingly. He put his finger to his lips. “Stay with Davy,” he said. Turning to me, he added: “When you wake Weldon, wake him easy. So.” He put his hand in mine, and gradually tightened it. “Wake him that way, and he won’t jump.” Polly Ann asked no questions. She looked at Tom, and her soul was in her face. She seized the pistol from the blanket. Then we watched him creeping down the creek on his belly, close to the bank. Next we moved behind the fallen tree, and I put my hand in Weldon’s. He woke with a sigh, started, but we drew him down behind the log. Presently he climbed cautiously up the bank and took station in the muddy roots of the tree.",

At last Tom reached the bend in the bank, beside some red-bud bushes, and there he stayed. A level shaft of light shot through the forest. The birds, twittering, awoke. A great hawk soared high in the blue over our heads. An hour passed. I had sighted the rifle among the yellow leaves of the fallen oak an hundred times. But Polly Ann looked not once to the right or left. Her eyes and her prayers followed the form of her husband. Then, like the cracking of a great drover’s whip, a shot rang out in the stillness, and my hands tightened over the rifle-stock. A piece of bark struck me in the face, and a dead leaf fluttered to the ground. Almost instantly there was another shot, and a blue wisp of smoke rose from the red-bud bushes, where Tom was. The horses whinnied, there was a rustle in the cane, and silence. Weldon bent over. “My God!” he whispered hoarsely, “he hit one. Tom hit one.” I felt Polly Ann’s hand on my face. “Davy dear,” she said, “are ye hurt?” “No,” said I, dazed, and wondering why Weldon had not been shot long ago as he slumbered. I was burning to climb the bank and ask him whether he had seen the Indian fall. Again there was silence,--a silence even more awful than before. The sun crept higher, the magic of his rays turning the creek from black to crystal, and the birds began to sing again.",

The same question was written in her yearning eyes, staring at the spot where the gray of his hunting shirt showed through the bushes at the bend. Suddenly her hand tightened on mine. The hunting shirt was gone! After that, in the intervals when my terror left me, I tried to speculate upon the plan of the savages. Their own numbers could not be great, and yet they must have known from our trace how few we were. Scanning the ground, I noted that the forest was fairly clean of undergrowth on both sides of us. Below, the stream ran straight, but there were growths of cane and briers. Looking up, I saw Weldon faced about. It was the obvious move. But where had Tom gone? Next my eye was caught by a little run fringed with bushes that curved around the cane near the bend. I traced its course, unconsciously, bit by bit, until it reached the edge of a bank not fifty feet away. All at once my breath left me. Through the tangle of bramble stems at the mouth of the run, above naked brown shoulders there glared at me, hideously streaked with red, a face. Had my fancy lied? I stared again until my eyes were blurred, now tortured by doubt, now so completely convinced that my fingers almost released the trigger,--for I had thrown the sights into line over the tree. I know not to this day whether I shot from determination or nervousness.",

One torture was over, another on. Crack after crack sounded from the forest--from here and there and everywhere, it seemed--and with a song that like a hurtling insect ran the scale of notes, the bullets buried themselves in the trunk of our oak with a chug. Once in a while I heard Weldon’s answering shot, but I remembered my promise to Tom not to waste powder unless I were sure. The agony was the breathing space we had while they crept nearer. Then we thought of Tom, and I dared not glance at Polly Ann for fear that the sight of her face would unnerve me. Then a longing to kill seized me, a longing so strange and fierce that I could scarce be still. I know now that it comes in battle to all men, and with intensity to the hunted, and it explained to me more clearly what followed. I fairly prayed for the sight of a painted form, and time after time my fancy tricked me into the notion that I had one. And even as I searched the brambles at the top of the run a puff of smoke rose out of them, a bullet burying itself in the roots near Weldon, who fired in return. I say that I have some notion of what possessed the man, for he was crazed with passion at fighting the race which had so cruelly wronged him.",

In less time than it takes me to write these words he had dragged a hideous, naked warrior out of the brambles, and with an avalanche of crumbling earth they slid into the waters of the creek. Polly Ann and I stared transfixed at the fearful fight that followed, nor can I give any adequate description of it. Weldon had struck through the brambles, but the savage had taken the blow on his gun-barrel and broken the handle of the tomahawk, and it was man to man as they rolled in the shallow water, locked in a death embrace. Neither might reach for his knife, neither was able to hold the other down, Weldon’s curses surcharged with hatred, the Indian straining silently save for a gasp or a guttural note, the white a bearded madman, the savage a devil with a glistening, paint-streaked body, his features now agonized as his muscles strained and cracked, now lighted with a diabolical joy. But the pent-up rage of months gave the white man strength. Polly Ann and I were powerless for fear of shooting Weldon, and gazed absorbed at the fiendish scene with eyes not to be withdrawn. The tree-trunk shook. A long, bronze arm reached out from above, and a painted face glowered at us from the very roots where Weldon had lain. That moment I took to be my last, and in it I seemed to taste all eternity.",

After that a confusion of shots, war-whoops, a vision of two naked forms flying from tree to tree towards the cane, and then--God be praised--Tom’s voice shouting:-- “Polly Ann! Polly Ann!” Before she had reached the top of the bank Tom had her in his arms, and a dozen tall gray figures leaped the six feet into the stream and stopped. My own eyes turned with theirs to see the body of poor Weldon lying face downward in the water. But beyond it a tragedy awaited me. Defiant, immovable, save for the heaving of his naked chest, the savage who had killed him stood erect with folded arms facing us. The smoke cleared away from a gleaming rifle-barrel, and the brave staggered and fell and died as silent as he stood, his feathers making ripples in the stream. It was cold-blooded, if you like, but war in those days was to the death, and knew no mercy. The tall backwoodsman who had shot him waded across the stream, and in the twinkling of an eye seized the scalp-lock and ran it round with his knife, holding up the bleeding trophy with a shout.

I looked up, and my eyes were caught and held with a strange fascination by fearless blue ones that gazed down into them. I give you but a poor description of the owner of these blue eyes, for personal magnetism springs not from one feature or another. He was a young man,--perhaps five and twenty as I now know age,--woodsman-clad, square-built, sun-reddened. His hair might have been orange in one light and sand-colored in another. With a boy’s sense of such things I knew that the other woodsmen were waiting for him to speak, for they glanced at him expectantly. “You had a near call, McChesney,” said he, at length; “fortunate for you we were after this band,--shot some of it to pieces yesterday morning.” He paused, looking at Tom with that quality of tribute which comes naturally to a leader of men.",

In fact, he said nothing more, but leaped down the bank and strode into the water where the body of Weldon lay, and dragged it out himself. We gathered around it silently, and two great tears rolled down Polly Ann’s cheeks as she parted the hair with tenderness and loosened the clenched hands. Nor did any of the tall woodsmen speak. Poor Weldon! The tragedy of his life and death was the tragedy of Kentucky herself. They buried him by the waterside, where he had fallen. But there was little time for mourning on the border. The burial finished, the Kentuckians splashed across the creek, and one of them, stooping with a shout at the mouth of the run, lifted out of the brambles a painted body with drooping head and feathers trailing. “Ay, Mac,” he cried, “here’s a sculp for ye.” “It’s Davy’s,” exclaimed Polly Ann from the top of the bank; “Davy shot that one.” “Hooray for Davy,” cried a huge, strapping backwoodsman who stood beside her, and the others laughingly took up the shout. “Hooray for Davy.

Colonel Clark, so I was told by my friend Cowan, held that title in Kentucky by reason of his prowess. Clark had been standing quietly on the bank while I had scalped my first redskin.

Looking up, I caught his eye on me again. “Mrs. McChesney,” said Colonel Clark to Polly Ann, “you look as if you could make johnny-cake.

He hated a man named Cameron, took me to Charlestown, and left me with some kin of his who had a place called Temple Bow, and went off to fight Cameron and the Cherokees.” There I gulped. “He was killed at Cherokee Ford, and--and I ran away from Temple Bow, and found Polly Ann.” This time I caught something of surprise on the Colonel’s face. “By thunder, Davy,” said he, “but you have a clean gift for brief narrative.

It is many, many years since I lived through that summer of siege in Harrodstown, the horrors of it are faded and dim, the discomforts lost to a boy thrilled with a new experience. I have read in my old age the books of travellers in Kentucky, English and French, who wrote much of squalor and strife and sin and little of those qualities that go to the conquest of an empire and the making of a people. Perchance my own pages may be colored by gratitude and love for the pioneers amongst whom I found myself, and thankfulness to God that we had reached them alive. I know not how many had been cooped up in the little fort since the early spring, awaiting the chance to go back to their weed-choked clearings. The fort at Harrodstown was like an hundred others I have since seen, but sufficiently surprising to me then. Imagine a great parallelogram made of log cabins set end to end, their common outside wall being the wall of the fort, and loopholed. At the four corners of the parallelogram the cabins jutted out, with ports in the angle in order to give a flanking fire in case the savages reached the palisade. And then there were huge log gates with watch-towers on either side where sentries sat day and night scanning the forest line. Within the fort was a big common dotted with forest trees, where such cattle as had been saved browsed on the scanty grass.",

Some were always to be found squatting on their door-steps cursing the hour which had seen them depart for this land; some wrestled and fought on the common, for a fist fight with a fair field and no favor was a favorite amusement of the backwoodsmen.

My strange life had far removed me from lads of my own age, and he took a fancy to me, perhaps because of the very persistence of my devotion to him. I cleaned his gun, filled his powder flask, and ran to do his every bidding. I used in the hot summer days to lie under the elm tree and listen to the settlers’ talk about a man named Henderson, who had bought a great part of Kentucky from the Indians, and had gone out with Boone to found Boonesboro some two years before. They spoke of much that I did not understand concerning the discountenance by Virginia of these claims, speculating as to whether Henderson’s grants were good. For some of them held these grants, and others Virginia grants--a fruitful source of quarrel between them. Some spoke, too, of Washington and his ragged soldiers going up and down the old colonies and fighting for a freedom which there seemed little chance of getting. But their anger seemed to blaze most fiercely when they spoke of a mysterious British general named Hamilton, whom they called “the ha’r buyer,” and who from his stronghold in the north country across the great Ohio sent down these hordes of savages to harry us.",

We laid at his door every outrage that had happened at the three stations, and put upon him the blood of those who had been carried off to torture in the Indian villages of the northern forests. And when--amidst great excitement--a spent runner would arrive from Boonesboro or St. Asaph’s and beg Mr. Clark for a squad, it was commonly with the first breath that came into his body that he cursed Hamilton. So the summer wore away, while we lived from hand to mouth on such scanty fare as the two of them shot and what we could venture to gather in the unkempt fields near the gates. A winter of famine lurked ahead, and men were goaded near to madness at the thought of clearings made and corn planted in the spring within reach of their hands, as it were, and they might not harvest it. At length, when a fortnight had passed, and Tom and Ray had gone forth day after day without sight or fresh sign of Indians, the weight lifted from our hearts. There were many things that might yet be planted and come to maturity before the late Kentucky frosts. The pressure within the fort, like a flood, opened the gates of it, despite the sturdily disapproving figure of a young man who stood silent under the sentry box, leaning on his Deckard. He was Colonel George Rogers Clark,¹ Commander-in-chief of the backwoodsmen of Kentucky, whose power was reënforced by that strange thing called an education.",

It was then that men began to scoff at him behind his back, though some spoke with sufficient backwoods bluntness to his face. And yet he gave no sign of anger or impatience. Not so the other leaders. No sooner did the danger seem past than bitter strife sprang up within the walls. Even the two captains were mortal enemies. One was Harrod, a tall, spare, dark-haired man of great endurance,--a type of the best that conquered the land for the nation; the other, that Hugh McGary of whom I have spoken, coarse and brutal, if you like, but fearless and a leader of men withal. A certain Sunday morning, I remember, broke with a cloud-flecked sky, and as we were preparing to go afield with such ploughs as could be got together (we were to sow turnips) the loud sounds of a quarrel came from the elm at the spring. With one accord men and women and children flocked thither, and as we ran we heard McGary’s voice above the rest. Worming my way, boylike, through the crowd, I came upon McGary and Harrod glaring at each other in the centre of it. “By Job! there’s no devil if I’ll stand back from my clearing and waste the rest of the summer for the fears of a pack of cowards. I’ll take a posse and march to Shawanee Springs this day, and see any man a fair fight that tries to stop me.” “And who’s in command here?” demanded Harrod.",

We’ll fetch that corn, or know the reason why.” A responding murmur showed that the bulk of them were with him. Weary of the pent-up life, longing for action, and starved for a good meal, the anger of his many followers against Clark and Harrod was nigh as great as his. He started roughly to shoulder his way out, and whether from accident or design Captain Harrod slipped in front of him, I never knew. The thing that followed happened quickly as the catching of my breath. I saw McGary powdering his pan, and Harrod his, and felt the crowd giving back like buffalo. All at once the circle had vanished, and the two men were standing not five paces apart with their rifles clutched across their bodies, each watching, catlike, for the other to level. It was a cry that startled us--and them. There was a vision of a woman flying across the common, and we saw the dauntless Mrs. Harrod snatching her husband’s gun from his resisting hands. So she saved his life and McGary’s. At this point Colonel Clark was seen coming from the gate.

As the day wore on to afternoon a blue haze--harbinger of autumn--settled over fort and forest.

Again I cried to her to set me down; but though her heart beat faster and her breath came shorter, she held me the tighter. Second by second they gained on us, relentlessly. Were we near the fort? Hoarse shouts answered the question, but they seemed distant--too distant. The savages were gaining, and Polly Ann’s breath quicker still. She staggered, but the brave soul had no thought of faltering. I had a sight of a man on a plough horse with dangling harness coming up from somewhere, of the man leaping off, of ourselves being pitched on the animal’s bony back and clinging there at the gallop, the man running at the side. Shots whistled over our heads, and here was the brown fort. Its big gates swung together as we dashed through the narrowed opening.

It seemed as if no man might live in the hellish storm that raged without the walls: as if the very impetus of hate and fury would carry the savages over the stockade to murder us. Into the turmoil at the gate came Colonel Clark, sending the disputants this way and that to defend the fort, McGary to command one quarter, Harrod and Bowman another, and every man that could be found to a loophole, while Mrs. Ray continued to run up and down, wringing her hands, now facing one man, now another.

One effect it had on me--to make me long even more earnestly to be a man. The impulse of my reputation led me farther.

He held himself a little aloof (as a leader should) from the captains in the station, without seeming to offend them. But he had a fancy for James Ray and for me, and he often took me into the woods with him by day, and talked with me of an evening. “I’m going away to Virginia, Davy,” he said; “will you not go with me? We’ll see Williamsburg, and come back in the spring, and I’ll have you a little rifle made.” My look must have been wistful. “I can’t leave Polly Ann and Tom,” I answered. “Well,” he said, “I like that. Faith to your friends is a big equipment for life.” “But why are you going?” I asked. “Because I love Kentucky best of all things in the world,” he answered, smiling. “And what are you going to do?” I insisted. “Ah,” he said, “that I can’t tell even to you.” “To catch Hamilton?” I ventured at random. He looked at me queerly. “Would you go along, Davy?” said he, laughing now. “Would you take Tom?” “Among the first,” answered Colonel Clark, heartily. We were seated under the elm near the spring, and at that instant I saw Tom coming toward us. I jumped up, thinking to please him by this intelligence, when Colonel Clark pulled me down again. “Davy,” said he, almost roughly, I thought, “remember that we have been joking.",

You have a tongue in your mouth, but sense enough in your head, I believe, to hold it.” He turned to Tom. “McChesney, this is a queer lad you brought us,” said he. “He’s a little deevil,” agreed Tom, for that had become a formula with him. It was all very mysterious to me, and I lay awake many a night with curiosity, trying to solve a puzzle that was none of my business. And one day, to cap the matter, two woodsmen arrived at Harrodstown with clothes frayed and bodies lean from a long journey. Not one of the hundred questions with which they were beset would they answer, nor say where they had been or why, save that they had carried out certain orders of Clark, who was locked up with them in a cabin for several hours. The first of October, the day of Colonel Clark’s departure, dawned crisp and clear. He was to take with him the disheartened and the cowed, the weaklings who loved neither work nor exposure nor danger. And before he set out of the gate he made a little speech to the assembled people. “My friends,” he said, “you know me. I put the interests of Kentucky before my own. Last year when I left to represent her at Williamsburg there were some who said I would desert her. It was for her sake I made that journey, suffered the tortures of hell from scalded feet, was near to dying in the mountains. It was for her sake that I importuned the governor and council for powder and lead, and when they refused it I said to them, ‘Gentlemen, a country that is not worth defending is not worth claiming.’” At these words the settlers gave a great shout, waving their coonskin hats in the air.",

I pray you trust me, and God bless and keep you while I am gone.” He did not forget to speak to me as he walked between our lines, and told me to be a good boy and that he would see me in the spring. Some of the women shed tears as he passed through the gate, and many of us climbed to sentry box and cabin roof that we might see the last of the little company wending its way across the fields. A motley company it was, the refuse of the station, headed by its cherished captain. So they started back over the weary road that led to that now far-away land of civilization and safety. During the balmy Indian summer, when the sharper lines of nature are softened by the haze, some came to us from across the mountains to make up for the deserters. From time to time a little group would straggle to the gates of the station, weary and footsore, but overjoyed at the sight of white faces again: the fathers walking ahead with watchful eyes, the women and older children driving the horses, and the babies slung to the pack in hickory withes. Nay, some of our best citizens came to Kentucky swinging to the tail of a patient animal. The Indians were still abroad, and in small war parties darted hither and thither with incredible swiftness.",

Sometimes it had been the gobble of a wild turkey that had lured to danger, again a wood-owl had cried strangely in the night. Winter came, and passed--somehow. I cannot dwell here on the tediousness of it, and the one bright spot it has left in my memory concerns Polly Ann. Did man, woman, or child fall sick, it was Polly Ann who nursed them. She had by nature the God-given gift of healing, knew by heart all the simple remedies that backwoods lore had inherited from the north of Ireland or borrowed from the Indians. Her sympathy and loving-kindness did more than these, her never tiring and ever cheerful watchfulness. She was deft, too, was Polly Ann, and spun from nettle bark many a cut of linen that could scarce be told from flax. Before the sap began to run again in the maples there was not a soul in Harrodstown who did not love her, and I truly believe that most of them would have risked their lives to do her bidding. Then came the sugaring, the warm days and the freezing nights when the earth stirs in her sleep and the taps drip from red sunrise to red sunset. Old and young went to the camps, the women and children boiling and graining, the squads of men posted in guards round about. And after that the days flew so quickly that it seemed as if the woods had burst suddenly into white flower, and it was spring again.",

And other wonders of that strange land I saw then for the first time: great licks, trampled down for acres by the wild herds, where the salt water oozes out of the hoofprints. On the edge of one of these licks we paused and stared breathless at giant bones sticking here and there in the black mud, and great skulls of fearful beasts half-embedded. This was called the Big Bone Lick, and some travellers that went before us had made their tents with the thighs of these monsters of a past age. A danger past is oft a danger forgotten. Men went out to build the homes of which they had dreamed through the long winter. Axes rang amidst the white dogwoods and the crabs and redbuds, and there were riotous log-raisings in the clearings. But I think the building of Tom’s house was the most joyous occasion of all, and for none in the settlement would men work more willingly than for him and Polly Ann. The cabin went up as if by magic. It stood on a rise upon the bank of the river in a grove of oaks and hickories, with a big persimmon tree in front of the door. It was in the shade of this tree that Polly Ann sat watching Tom and me through the mild spring days as we barked the roof, and none ever felt greater joy and pride in a home than she.",

After that we went to ploughing, an occupation which Tom fancied but little, for he loved the life of a hunter best of all. But there was corn to be raised and fodder for the horses, and a truck-patch to be cleared near the house. One day a great event happened,--and after the manner of many great events, it began in mystery. Leaping on the roan mare, I was riding like mad for Harrodstown to fetch Mrs. Cowan. And she, when she heard the summons, abandoned a turkey on the spit, pitched her brats out of the door, seized the mare, and dashing through the gates at a gallop left me to make my way back afoot. Scenting a sensation, I hurried along the wooded trace at a dog trot, and when I came in sight of the cabin there was Mrs. Cowan sitting on the step, holding in her long but motherly arms something bundled up in nettle linen, while Tom stood sheepishly by, staring at it. “Shucks,” Mrs. Cowan was saying loudly, “I reckon ye’re as little use to-day as Swein Poulsson,--standin’ there on one foot. Ye anger me--just grinning at it like a fool--and yer own doin’. Have ye forgot how to talk?” Tom grinned the more, but was saved the effort of a reply by a loud noise from the bundle.",

Polly Ann lay on the log bedstead, and she turned to mine a face radiant with a happiness I had not imagined. “Oh, Davy, have ye seen him? Have ye seen little Tom? Davy, I reckon I’ll never be so happy again. Fetch him here, Mrs. Cowan.” Mrs. Cowan, with a glance of contempt at Tom and me, put the bundle tenderly down on the coarse brown sheet beside her. Poor little Tom! Only the first fortnight of his existence was spent in peace. I have a pathetic memory of it all--of our little home, of our hopes for it, of our days of labor and nights of planning to make it complete. And then, one morning when the three of us were turning over the black loam in the patch, while the baby slept peacefully in the shade, a sound came to our ears that made us pause and listen with bated breath. It was the sound of many guns, muffled in the distant forest. With a cry Polly Ann flew to the hickory cradle under the tree, Tom sprang for the rifle that was never far from his side, while with a kind of instinct I ran to catch the spancelled horses by the river.",

There was nothing to do but cower in the thicket, listening while the battle went on afar, Polly Ann trying to still the cries of the child, lest they should bring death upon us. At length the shooting ceased; stillness reigned; then came a faint halloo, and out of the forest beyond us a man rode, waving his hat at the fort. After him came others. The gates opened, and we rushed pell-mell across the fields to safety. The Indians had shot at a party shelling corn at Captain Bowman’s plantation, and killed two, while the others had taken refuge in the crib. Fired at from every brake, James Ray had ridden to Harrodstown for succor, and the savages had been beaten off. But only the foolhardy returned to their clearings now. We were on the edge of another dreaded summer of siege, the prospect of banishment from the homes we could almost see, staring us in the face, and the labors of the spring lost again.

It was that very night, too, I sat with Cowan, who had duty in one of the sentry boxes, and we heard a voice calling softly under us. Fearing treachery, Cowan cried out for a sign. Then the answer came back loudly to open to a runner with a message from Colonel Clark to Captain Harrod. Cowan let the man in, while I ran for the captain, and in five minutes it seemed as if every man and woman and child in the fort were awake and crowding around the man by the gates, their eager faces reddened by the smoking pine knots. Where was Clark? What had he been doing? Had he deserted them? “Deserted ye!” cried the runner, and swore a great oath. Wasn’t Clark even then on the Ohio raising a great army with authority from the Commonwealth of Virginia to rid them of the red scourge? And would they desert him? Or would they be men and bring from Harrodstown the company he asked for? Then Captain Harrod read the letter asking him to raise the company, and before day had dawned they were ready for the word to march--ready to leave cabin and clearing, and wife and child, trusting in Clark’s judgment for time and place. Never were volunteers mustered more quickly than in that cool April night by the gates of Harrodstown Station. “And we’ll fetch Davy along, for luck,” cried Cowan, catching sight of me beside him. “Sure we’ll be wanting a dhrummer b’y,” said McCann.

I can see her now, standing among the women by the great hewn gateposts, with little Tom in her arms, holding him out to us as we filed by. And the vision of his little, round face haunted Tom and me for many weary miles of our tramp through the wilderness. I have often thought since that that march of the volunteer company to join Clark at the Falls of the Ohio was a superb example of confidence in one man, and scarce to be equalled in history. In less than a week we of Captain Harrod’s little company stood on a forest-clad bank, gazing spellbound at the troubled waters of a mighty river. That river was the Ohio, and it divided us from the strange north country whence the savages came. From below, the angry voice of the Great Falls cried out to us unceasingly. Smoke rose through the tree-tops of the island opposite, and through the new gaps of its forest cabins could be seen. And presently, at a signal from us, a big flatboat left its shore, swung out and circled on the polished current, and grounded at length in the mud below us. A dozen tall boatmen, buckskin-clad, dropped the big oars and leaped out on the bank with a yell of greeting. At the head of them was a man of huge frame, and long, light hair falling down over the collar of his hunting shirt. He wrung Captain Harrod’s hand. “That there’s Simon Kenton, Davy,” said Cowan, as we stood watching them.",

He ain’t said a word.” “He doesn’t say whar he’s going?” said Harrod. “Not a notion,” answered Kenton. “He’s the greatest man to keep his mouth shut I ever saw. He kept at the governor of Virginny till he gave him twelve hundred pounds in Continentals and power to raise troops. Then Clark fetched a circle for Fort Pitt, raised some troops thar and in Virginny and some about Red Stone, and come down the Ohio here with ‘em in a lot of flatboats. Now that ye’ve got here the Kentucky boys is all in. I come over with Montgomery, and Dillard’s here from the Holston country with a company.” “Well,” said Captain Harrod, “I reckon we’ll report.” I went among the first boat-load, and as the men strained against the current, Kenton explained that Colonel Clark had brought a number of emigrants down the river with him; that he purposed to leave them on this island with a little force, that they might raise corn and provisions during the summer; and that he had called the place Corn Island.",

And now but a faint rim of light saved us from utter darkness. Big Bill Cowan, undaunted in war, stared at me with fright written on his face. “And what ‘ll ye think of it, Davy?” he said. I glanced at the figure of our commander in the boat ahead, and took courage. “It’s Hamilton’s scalp hanging by a lock,” I answered, pointing to what was left of the sun.",

The word was cried from boat to boat, and we could see the men pointing upwards and laughing. And then, as the light began to grow, we were in the midst of the tumbling waters, the steersmen straining now right, now left, to keep the prows in the smooth reaches between rock and bar. We gained the still pools below, the sun came out once more and smiled on the landscape, and the spirits of the men, reviving, burst all bounds. Thus I earned my reputation as a prophet. Four days and nights we rowed down the great river, our oars double-manned, for fear that our coming might be heralded to the French towns. We made our first camp on a green little island at the mouth of the Cherokee, as we then called the Tennessee, and there I set about cooking a turkey for Colonel Clark, which Ray had shot. Chancing to look up, I saw the Colonel himself watching me. “How is this, Davy?” said he. “I hear that you have saved my army for me before we have met the enemy.” “I did not know it, sir,” I answered. “Well,” said he, “if you have learned to turn an evil omen into a good sign, you know more than some generals.

And all of them not moving: “Get your men back, I say.

Who be you?” he added suspiciously. “Be you Rebels?” “Colonel Clark is my name, and I am in the service of the Commonwealth of Virginia.” Duff uttered an exclamatory oath and his manner changed. “Be you Clark?” he said with respect. “And you’re going after Kaskasky?

Yes, the trail had been blazed the Lord knew how long ago by the French, and given up when they left Massacre. “Look you,” said Clark to him, “I am not a man to stand trifling.

KASKASKIA For one more day we floated downward on the face of the waters between the forest walls of the wilderness, and at length we landed in a little gully on the north shore of the river, and there we hid our boats. “Davy,” said Colonel Clark, “let’s walk about a bit. Tell me where you learned to be so silent?” “My father did not like to be talked to,” I answered, “except when he was drinking.” He gave me a strange look. Many the stroll I took with him afterwards, when he sought to relax himself from the cares which the campaign had put upon him. This night was still and clear, the west all yellow with the departing light, and the mists coming on the river. And presently, as we strayed down the shore we came upon a strange sight, the same being a huge fort rising from the waterside, all overgrown with brush and saplings and tall weeds. The palisades that held its earthenwork were rotten and crumbling, and the mighty bastions of its corners sliding away. Behind the fort, at the end farthest from the river, we came upon gravelled walks hidden by the rank growth, where the soldiers of his most Christian Majesty once paraded. Lost in thought, Clark stood on the parapet, watching the water gliding by until the darkness hid it,--nay, until the stars came and made golden dimples upon its surface. But as we went back to the camp again he told me how the French had tried once to conquer this vast country and failed, leaving to the Spaniards the endless stretch beyond the Mississippi called Louisiana, and this part to the English.",

And they called this river ‘La Belle Rivière,’--the Beautiful River.” “And shall I see that race at Kaskaskia?” I asked, wondering. “That you shall,” he cried, with a force that left no doubt in my mind. In the morning we broke camp and started off for the strange place which we hoped to capture. A hundred miles it was across the trackless wilds, and each man was ordered to carry on his back provisions for four days only. “Herr Gott!” cried Swein Poulsson, from the bottom of a flatboat, whence he was tossing out venison flitches, “four day, und vat is it ve eat then?” “Frenchies, sure,” said Terence; “there’ll be plenty av thim for a season.

For three days we marched in the green shade of the primeval wood, nor saw the sky save in blue patches here and there. Again we toiled for hours through the coffee-colored waters of the swamps. But the third day brought us to the first of those strange clearings which the French call prairies, where the long grass ripples like a lake in the summer wind. Here we first knew raging thirst, and longed for the loam-specked water we had scorned, as our tired feet tore through the grass. For Saunders, our guide, took a line across the open in plain sight of any eye that might be watching from the forest cover. But at length our column wavered and halted by reason of some disturbance at the head of it. Conjectures in our company, the rear guard, became rife at once. “Run, Davy darlin,’ an’ see what the throuble is,” said Terence.

I’ve been watching you every step, and you’ve acted strangely this morning.” “Ay, ay,” came from the men round him. “Silence!” cried Clark, and turned again to the cowering Saunders. “You pretend to know the way to Kaskaskia, you bring us to the middle of the Indian country where we may be wiped out at any time, and now you have the damned effrontery to tell me that you have lost your way.

I swear it on the evangels.” “A hard country!” cried Clark. “A man would have to walk over it but once to know it.

Then his eye lighted on me. “Where’s McChesney?” he said. “Fetch McChesney.” I ran to get Tom, and seven of them went away, with Saunders in the middle, Clark watching them like a hawk, while the men sat down in the grass to wait. Fifteen minutes went by, and twenty, and twenty-five, and Clark was calling for a rope, when some one caught sight of the squad in the distance returning at a run. And when they came within hail it was Saunders’ voice we heard, shouting brokenly:-- “I’ve struck it, Colonel, I’ve struck the trace. There’s a pecan at the edge of the bottom with my own blaze on it.” “May you never be as near death again,” said the Colonel, grimly, as he gave the order to march. The fourth day passed, and we left behind us the patches of forest and came into the open prairie,--as far as the eye could reach a long, level sea of waving green. The scanty provisions ran out, hunger was added to the pangs of thirst and weariness, and here and there in the straggling file discontent smouldered and angry undertone was heard. Kaskaskia was somewhere to the west and north; but how far? Clark had misled them. And in addition it were foolish to believe that the garrison had not been warned. English soldiers and French militia and Indian allies stood ready for our reception. Of such was the talk as we lay down in the grass under the stars on the fifth night.

We pressed ahead, and the destiny of the new Republic for which we had fought made us walk unseen. Excitement keyed us high; we reached the shade, plunged into it, and presently came out staring at the bastioned corners of a fort which rose from the centre of a clearing. It had once defended the place, but now stood abandoned and dismantled. Beyond it, at the edge of the bluff, we halted, astonished. The sun was falling in the west, and below us was the goal for the sight of which we had suffered so much. At our feet, across the wooded bottom, was the Kaskaskia River, and beyond, the peaceful little French village with its low houses and orchards and gardens colored by the touch of the evening light. In the centre of it stood a stone church with its belfry; but our searching eyes alighted on the spot to the southward of it, near the river. There stood a rambling stone building with the shingles of its roof weathered black, and all around it a palisade of pointed sticks thrust in the ground, and with a pair of gates and watch-towers. Drooping on its staff was the standard of England.",

Midnight was at hand. Commands were passed about, and men ran this way and that, jostling one another to find their places in a new order.

And now I scarcely knew our commander. For we had not gone far ere, timidly, a door opened and a mild-visaged man, in the simple workaday smock that the French wore, stood, hesitating, on the steps. The odd thing was that he should have bowed to Clark, who was dressed no differently from Bowman and Harrod and Duff; and the man’s voice trembled piteously as he spoke. It needed not John Duff to tell us that he was pleading for the lives of his family. “He will sell himself as a slave if your Excellency will spare them,” said Duff, translating. But Clark stared at the man sternly. “I will tell them my plans at the proper time,” he said and when Duff had translated this the man turned and went silently into his house again, closing the door behind him. And before we had traversed the village the same thing had happened many times. We gained the fort again, I wondering greatly why he had not reassured these simple people. It was Bowman who asked this question, he being closer to Clark than any of the other captains. Clark said nothing then, and began to give out directions for the day. But presently he called the Captain aside. “Bowman,” I heard him say, “we have one hundred and fifty men to hold a province bigger than the whole of France, and filled with treacherous tribes in the King’s pay.",

Clark, with that touch which made men love him and die for him, laid his hand on the Captain’s shoulder. “Have the men called in by detachments,” he said, “and fed. God knows they must be hungry,--and you.” Suddenly I remembered that he himself had had nothing. Running around the commandant’s house to the kitchen door, I came unexpectedly upon Swein Poulsson, who was face to face with the linsey-woolsey-clad figure of Monsieur Rocheblave’s negro cook. The early sun cast long shadows of them on the ground. “By tam,” my friend was saying, “so I vill eat. I am choost like an ox for three days, und chew grass. Prairie grass, is it?” “Mo pas capab’, Michié,” said the cook, with a terrified roll of his white eyes. “Herr Gott!” cried Swein Poulsson, “I am red face. Aber Herr Gott, I thank thee I am not a nigger. Und my hair is bristles, yes. Davy” (spying me), “I thank Herr Gott it is not vool. Let us in the kitchen go.” “I am come to get something for the Colonel’s breakfast,” said I, pushing past the slave, through the open doorway. Swein Poulsson followed, and here I struck another contradiction in his strange nature. He helped me light the fire in the great stone chimney-place, and we soon had a pot of hominy on the crane, and turning on the spit a piece of buffalo steak which we found in the larder. Nor did a mouthful pass his lips until I had sped away with a steaming portion to find the Colonel.",

Then the Colonel took me by the arms, as gently as a woman might, set me down on the ground beside him, and taking a spoonful of the hominy forced it between my lips. I was near to fainting at the taste of it. Then he took a bit himself, and divided the buffalo steak with his own hands. And when from the camp-fires they perceived the Colonel and the drummer boy eating together in plain sight of all, they gave a rousing cheer. “Swein Poulsson helped get your breakfast, sir, and would eat nothing either,” I ventured. “Davy,” said Colonel Clark, gravely, “I hope you will be younger when you are twenty.” “I hope I shall be bigger, sir,” I answered gravely. CHAPTER XIV. HOW THE KASKASKEIANS WERE MADE CITIZENS Never before had such a day dawned upon Kaskaskia. With July fierceness the sun beat down upon the village, but man nor woman nor child stirred from the darkened houses. What they awaited at the hands of the Long Knives they knew not,--captivity, torture, death perhaps. Through the deserted streets stalked a squad of backwoodsmen headed by John Duff and two American traders found in the town, who were bestirring themselves in our behalf, knocking now at this door and anon at that. “The Colonel bids you come to the fort,” he said, and was gone.",

Two companies were drawn up in the sun before the old Jesuit house, and presently through the gate a procession came, grave and mournful. The tone of it was sombre in the white glare, for men had donned their best (as they thought) for the last time,--cloth of camlet and Cadiz and Limbourg, white cotton stockings, and brass-buckled shoes. They came like captives led to execution. But at their head a figure held our eye,--a figure that spoke of dignity and courage, of trials borne for others. It was the village priest in his robes. He had a receding forehead and a strong, pointed chin; but benevolence was in the curve of his great nose. I have many times since seen his type of face in the French prints. He and his flock halted before our young Colonel, even as the citizens of Calais in a bygone century must have stood before the English king. The scene comes back to me. On the one side, not the warriors of a nation that has made its mark in war, but peaceful peasants who had sought this place for its remoteness from persecution, to live and die in harmony with all mankind. On the other, the sinewy advance guard of a race that knows not peace, whose goddess of liberty carries in her hand a sword. The plough might have been graven on our arms, but always the rifle. The silence of the trackless wilds reigned while Clark gazed at them sternly.",

Clark told them first that they had been given a false and a wicked notion of the American cause, and he spoke of the tyranny of the English king, which had become past endurance to a free people. As for ourselves, the Long Knives, we came in truth to conquer, and because of their hasty judgment the Kaskaskians were at our mercy. The British had told them that the Kentuckians were a barbarous people, and they had believed. He paused that John Duff might translate and the gist of what he had said sink in. But suddenly the priest had stepped out from the ranks, faced his people, and was himself translating in a strong voice. When he had finished a tremor shook the group. But he turned calmly and faced Clark once more. “Citizens of Kaskaskia,” Colonel Clark went on, “the king whom you renounced when the English conquered you, the great King of France, has judged for you and the French people. Knowing that the American cause is just, he is sending his fleets and regiments to fight for it against the British King, who until now has been your sovereign.” Again he paused, and when the priest had told them this, a murmur of astonishment came from the boldest. “Citizens of Kaskaskia, know you that the Long Knives come not to massacre, as you foolishly believed, but to release from bondage.",

He turned once more, and though we could not understand his words, the thrill of his eloquence moved us. And when he had finished there was a moment’s hush of inarticulate joy among his flock, and then such transports as moved strangely the sternest men in our ranks. The simple people fell to embracing each other and praising God, the tears running on their cheeks. Out of the group came an old man. A skullcap rested on his silvered hair, and he felt the ground uncertainly with his gold-headed stick. “Monsieur,” he said tremulously “you will pardon an old man if he show feeling.

And when it had died down Colonel Clark took the old Gascon by the hand, and not a man of his but saw that this was a master-stroke of his genius. “My friends,” he said simply, “I thank you. I would not force you, and you will have some days to think over the oath of allegiance to the Republic. Go now to your homes, and tell those who are awaiting you what I have said. And if any man of French birth wish to leave this place, he may go of his own free will, save only three whom I suspect are not our friends.” They turned, and in an ecstasy of joy quite pitiful to see went trooping out of the gate. But scarce could they have reached the street and we have broken ranks, when we saw them coming back again, the priest leading them as before. They drew near to the spot where Clark stood, talking to the captains, and halted expectantly. “What is it, my friends?” asked the Colonel. The priest came forward and bowed gravely. “I am Père Gibault, sir,” he said, “curé of Kaskaskia.” He paused, surveying our commander with a clear eye. “There is something that still troubles the good citizens.” “And what is that, sir?” said Clark. The priest hesitated. “If your Excellency will only allow the church to be opened--” he ventured. The group stood wistful, fearful that their boldness had displeased, expectant of reprimand.",

Will you do me that honor, Father?” “With all my heart, your Excellency,” said Father Gibault. And turning to the people, he translated what the Colonel had said.

As we walked back towards the fort we came to a little house with a flower garden in front of it, and there stood Colonel Clark himself by the gate.

The sum I have is at your service. The good Congress will repay me. And you need the money.” Colonel Clark was not an impulsive man, but he felt none the less deeply, as I know well. His reply to this generous offer was almost brusque, but it did not deceive the priest. “Nay, monsieur,” he said, “it is for mankind I give it, in remembrance of Him who gave everything. And though I receive nothing in return, I shall have my reward an hundred fold.” In due time, I know not how, the talk swung round again to lightness, for the Colonel loved a good story, and the priest had many which he told with wit in his quaint French accent.

In the first place, Captain Bowman’s company, with a few scouts, of which Tom was one, set out that very afternoon for the capture of Cohos, or Cahokia, and this despite the fact that they had had no sleep for two nights. If you will look at the map, ¹ you will see, dotted along the bottoms and the bluffs beside the great Mississippi, the string of villages, Kaskaskia, La Prairie du Rocher, Fort Chartres, St. Philip, and Cahokia. Some few miles from Cahokia, on the western bank of the Father of Waters, was the little French village of St. Louis, in the Spanish territory of Louisiana. From thence eastward stretched the great waste of prairie and forest inhabited by roving bands of the forty Indian nations. Then you come to Vincennes on the Wabash, Fort St. Vincent, the English and Canadians called it, for there were a few of the latter who had settled in Kaskaskia since the English occupation. ¹The best map which the editor has found of this district is in vol. VI, Part 11, of Winsor’s “Narrative and Critical History of America,” p. 721. We gathered on the western skirts of the village to give Bowman’s company a cheer, and every man, woman, and child in the place watched the little column as it wound snakelike over the prairie on the road to Fort Chartres, until it was lost in the cottonwoods to the westward.",

Many had left families in the frontier forts without protection. The time of their enlistment had almost expired. There was a store in the village kept by a great citizen,--not a citizen of Kaskaskia alone, but a citizen of the world. This, I am aware, sounds like fiction, like an attempt to get an effect which was not there. But it is true as gospel. The owner of this store had many others scattered about in this foreign country: at Vincennes, at St. Louis, where he resided, at Cahokia. He knew Michilimackinac and Quebec and New Orleans.

And how are you called, my son?” he added, patting me kindly. “Davy, sir,” I answered. “Ha,” he said, “and a brave soldier, no doubt.” I was flattered as well as astonished by this attention. But Monsieur Vigo knew men, and he had given them time to turn around. By this time Bill Cowan and some of my friends had stooped through the doorway, followed by a prying Kaskaskian brave and as many Creoles as could crowd behind them. Monsieur Vigo was surprisingly calm. “It make hot weather, my frens,” said he. “How can I serve you, messieurs?” “Hain’t the Congress got authority here?” said one. “I am happy to say,” answered Monsieur Vigo, rubbing his hands, “for I think much of your principle.” “Then,” said the man, “we come here to trade with Congress money. Hain’t that money good in Kaskasky?” There was an anxious pause. Then Monsieur Vigo’s eyes twinkled, and he looked at me. “And what you say, Davy?” he asked. “The money would be good if you took it, sir,” I said, not knowing what else to answer.",

Davy, you stay here.” I remained, while the others filed out, and at length I was alone with him and Jules, his clerk. “Davy, how you like to be trader?” asked Monsieur Vigo. It was a new thought to me, and I turned it over in my mind. To see the strange places of the world, and the stranger people; to become a man of wealth and influence such as Monsieur Vigo; and (I fear I loved it best) to match my brains with others at a bargain,--I turned it all over slowly, gravely, in my boyish mind, rubbing the hard dirt on the floor with the toe of my moccasin.",

I shook my head, but in spite of me I felt the tears welling into my eyes and brushed them away shamefully. At such times of stress some of my paternal Scotch crept into my speech. “I will no be leaving Colonel Clark and the boys,” I cried, “not for all the money in the world.” “Congress money?” said Monsieur Vigo, with a queer expression. It was then I laughed through my tears, and that cemented the friendship between us. It was a lifelong friendship, though I little suspected it then. In the days that followed he never met me on the street that he did not stop to pass the time of day, and ask me if I had changed my mind. He came every morning to headquarters, where he and Colonel Clark sat by the hour with brows knit. Monsieur Vigo was as good as his word, and took the Congress money, though not at such a value as many would have had him. I have often thought that we were all children then, and knew nothing of the ingratitude of republics. Monsieur Vigo took the money, and was all his life many, many thousand dollars the poorer. Father Gibault advanced his little store, and lived to feel the pangs of want. And Colonel Clark? But I must not go beyond the troubles of that summer, and the problems that vexed our commander. One night I missed him from the room where we slept, and walking into the orchard found him pacing there, where the moon cast filmy shadows on the grass.",

The moon dipped to the uneven line of the ridge-pole and slipped behind the stone chimney. All at once he stopped, dropped my hand, and smote both of his together. “I will hold on, by the eternal!” he cried. “I will let no American read his history and say that I abandoned this land. Let them desert! If ten men be found who will stay, I will hold the place for the Republic.” “Will not Virginia and the Congress send you men, sir?” I asked wonderingly. He laughed a laugh that was all bitterness. “Virginia and the Continental Congress know little and care less about me,” he answered. “Some day you will learn that foresight sometimes comes to men, but never to assemblies.

There were fights, too, that had to be quelled by company captains, and no man knew when the loud quarrel between the two races at Vigo’s store would grow into an ugly battle. What did Clark intend to do? This was the question that hung in the minds of mutineer and faithful alike. They knew the desperation of his case. Without money, save that which the generous Creoles had advanced upon his personal credit; without apparent resources; without authority, save that which the weight of his character exerted,--how could he prevent desertion? They eyed him as he went from place to place about his business,--erect, thoughtful, undisturbed. Few men dare to set their will against a multitude when there are no fruits to be won. Columbus persisted, and found a new world; Clark persisted, and won an empire for thoughtless generations to enjoy. That night he slept not at all, but sat, while the candles flickered in their sockets, poring over maps and papers. I dared not disturb him, but lay the darkness through with staring eyes.

First, the departure of Father Gibault with several Creole gentlemen and a spy of Colonel Clark’s for Vincennes, and their triumphant return in August. The sacrifice of the good priest had not been in vain, and he came back with the joyous news of a peaceful conquest.

These came to Kaskaskia to join our home-goers, and no sooner had the hundred marched out of the gate and taken up their way for Kentucky than Colonel Clark began the drilling of the new troops. Captain Leonard Helm was sent to take charge of Vincennes, and Captain Montgomery set out across the mountains for Williamsburg with letters praying the governor of Virginia to come to our assistance. For another cloud had risen in the horizon: another problem for Clark to face of greater portent than all the others. A messenger from Captain Bowman at Cohos came riding down the street on a scraggly French pony, and pulled up before headquarters. The messenger was Sergeant Thomas McChesney, and his long legs almost reached the ground on either side of the little beast. Leaping from the saddle, he seized me in his arms, set me down, and bade me tell Colonel Clark of his arrival. It was a sultry August morning. Within the hour Colonel Clark and Tom and myself were riding over the dusty trace that wound westward across the common lands of the village, which was known as the Fort Chartres road.

Curiosity, that mainspring of the Indian character, had brought the chiefs, big and little, to see with their own eyes the great Captain of the Long Knives.

And if he failed to impress them with his power, with the might of the Congress for which he fought, no man of his would ever see Kentucky again.

Tom pulled it from the bosom of his hunting shirt to show me, and in it was a little ring of hair like unto the finest spun red-gold. This was the message Polly Ann had sent,--a message from little Tom as well. At Prairie du Rocher, at St. Philippe, the inhabitants lined the streets to do homage to this man of strange power who rode, unattended and unafraid, to the council of the savage tribes which had terrorized his people of Kentucky. From the ramparts of Fort Chartres (once one of the mighty chain of strongholds to protect a new France, and now deserted like Massacre), I gazed for the first time in awe at the turgid flood of the Mississippi, and at the lands of the Spanish king beyond.

And when the sun sets on those snows they are rubies, and the skies above them sapphire.” “I was born amongst the mountains, sir,” I answered, my pulse quickening at his description, “but they were not so high as those you speak of.” “Then,” said Monsieur Gratiot, “you can understand a little my sorrow as a lad when I left it. From Switzerland I went to a foggy place called London, and thence I crossed the ocean to the solemn forests of the north of Canada, where I was many years, learning the characters of these gentlemen who are looking in upon us.” And he waved his arm at the line of peering red faces by the pickets. Monsieur Gratiot smiled at Clark. “And there’s another point of resemblance between myself and Monsieur Vigo.” “Have you taken the paper money?” I demanded. Monsieur Gratiot slapped his linen breeches. “That I have,” and this time I thought he was going to laugh. But he did not, though his eyes sparkled. “And do you think that the good Congress will ever repay me, Davy?” “Peste!” exclaimed Monsieur Gratiot, but he did not seem to be offended or shaken. “Davy,” said Colonel Clark, “we have had enough of predictions fo the present. Fetch this letter to Captain Bowman at the garrison up the street.” He handed me the letter.",

By intuition I kicked him in the stomach with all my might, and with a howl of surprise and rage his fingers gripped into my flesh. The next thing I remember was being in the dust, suffocated by that odor which he who has known it can never forget. A medley of discordant cries was in my ears. Then I was snatched up, bumped against heads and shoulders, and deposited somewhere. Now it was Tom’s face that was close to mine, and the light of a fierce anger was in his blue eyes. “Did they hurt ye, Davy?” he asked. I shook my head. Before I could speak he was at the gate again, confronting the mob of savages that swayed against the fence, and the street was filled with running figures. A voice of command that I knew well came from behind me. It was Colonel Clark’s. “Stay where you are, McChesney!” he shouted, and Tom halted with his hand on the latch. “With your permission, I will speak to them,” said Monsieur Gratiot, who had come out also. I looked up at him, and he was as calm as when he had joked with me a quarter of an hour since. “Very well,” said Clark, briefly. Monsieur Gratiot surveyed them scornfully. “Where is the Hungry Wolf, who speaks English?” he said. There was a stir in the rear ranks, and a lean savage with abnormal cheek bones pushed forward.",

His words, hoarse and resonant, seemed to come from the depths of his body. Presently he paused, and there came an answer from the fiend who had seized me. After that there were many grunts, and the Hungry Wolf turned again. “The North Wind mean no harm,” he answered. “He play with the son of the Great White Chief, and his belly is very sore where the Chief’s son kicked him.” “The Chief of the Long Knives will consider the offence,” said Monsieur Gratiot, and retired into the house with Colonel Clark. For a full five minutes the Indians waited, impassive. And then Monsieur Gratiot reappeared, alone. “The Chief of the Long Knives is mercifully inclined to forgive,” he said. “It was in play. But there must be no more play with the Chief’s son. And the path to the Great Chief’s presence must be kept clear.” Again the Hungry Wolf translated. The North Wind grunted and departed in silence, followed by many of his friends. And indeed for a while after that the others kept a passage clear to the gate. As for the son of the Great White Chief, he sat for a long time that afternoon beside the truck patch of the house.",

And that day he found what his Colonel had long since learned to be true--that in courage is the greater safety. The power of the Great White Chief was such that he allowed his son to go forth alone, and feared not for his life. Even so Clark himself walked among them, nor looked to right or left. Two nights Colonel Clark sat through, calling now on this man and now on that, and conning the treaties which the English had made with the various tribes--ay, and French and Spanish treaties too--until he knew them all by heart. There was no haste in what he did, no uneasiness in his manner. He listened to the advice of Monsieur Gratiot and other Creole gentlemen of weight, to the Spanish officers who came in their regimentals from St. Louis out of curiosity to see how this man would treat with the tribes. For he spoke of his intentions to none of them, and gained the more respect by it. Within the week the council began; and the scene of the great drama was a field near the village, the background of forest trees. Few plays on the world’s stage have held such suspense, few battles such excitement for those who watched. Here was the spectacle of one strong man’s brain pitted against the combined craft of the wilderness.",

Around him were ringed the gathered tribes, each chief in the order of his importance squatted in the inner circle, their blankets making patches of bright color against the green. Behind the tribes was the little group of hunting shirts, the men leaning on the barrels of their long rifles, indolent but watchful. Here and there a gay uniform of a Spanish or Creole officer, and behind these all the population of the village that dared to show itself. The ceremonies began with the kindling of the council fire,--a rite handed down through unknown centuries of Indian usage. By it nations had been made and unmade, broad lands passed, even as they now might pass. The yellow of its crackling flames was shamed by the summer sun, and the black smoke of it was wafted by the south wind over the forest. Then for three days the chiefs spoke, and a man listened, unmoved. The sound of these orations, wild and fearful to my boyish ear, comes back to me now. Yet there was a cadence in it, a music of notes now falling, now rising to a passion and intensity that thrilled us. Bad birds flying through the land (the British agents) had besought them to take up the bloody hatchet. They had sinned. They had listened to the lies which the bad birds had told of the Big Knives, they had taken their presents.",

On the evening of the third day the White Chief rose in his chair, gazing haughtily about him. There was a deep silence. “Tell your chiefs,” he said, “tell your chiefs that to-morrow I will give them an answer. And upon the manner in which they receive that answer depends the fate of your nations. Good night.” They rose and, thronging around him, sought to take his hand. But Clark turned from them. “Peace is not yet come,” he said sternly. “It is time to take the hand when the heart is given with it.” A feathered headsman of one of the tribes gave back with dignity and spoke. “It is well said by the Great Chief of the Pale Faces,” he answered; “these in truth are not the words of a man with a double tongue.” So they sought their quarters for the night, and suspense hung breathless over the village. There were many callers at the stone house that evening,--Spanish officers, Creole gentlemen, an English Canadian trader or two.

At intervals some disputant would pause in his talk to kill a mosquito or fight away a moth or a June-bug, but presently the argument reached such a pitch that the mosquitoes fed undisturbed. “You have done much, sir,” said the Spanish commandant of St. Louis, “but the savage, he will never be content without present. He will never be won without present.” Clark was one of those men who are perforce listened to when they begin to speak. “Captain de Leyba,” said he, “I know not what may be the present policy of his Spanish Majesty with McGillivray and his Creeks in the south, but this I do believe,” and he brought down his fist among the papers, “that the old French and Spanish treaties were right in principle. Here are copies of the English treaties that I have secured, and in them thousands of sovereigns have been thrown away. They are so much waste paper. Gentlemen, the Indians are children. If you give them presents, they believe you to be afraid of them.

A party of young Puan bucks had decreed it to be their pleasure to encamp in Mr. Brady’s yard, to peer through the shutters into Mr. Brady’s house, to enjoy themselves by annoying Mr. Brady’s family and others as much as possible. During the Indian occupation of Cahokia this band had gained a well-deserved reputation for mischief; and chief among them was the North Wind himself, whom I had done the honor to kick in the stomach. To-night they had made a fire in this Mr. Brady’s flower-garden, over which they were cooking venison steaks. And, as I reached the door, the North Wind spied me, grinned, rubbed his stomach, made a false dash at me that frightened me out of my wits, and finally went through the pantomime of scalping me. I stood looking at him with my legs apart, for the son of the Great Chief must not run away. And I marked that the North Wind had two great ornamental daubs like shutter-fastenings painted on his cheeks. I sniffed preparation, too, on his followers, and I was sure they were getting ready for some new deviltry. I handed the note to Mr. Brady through the crack of the door that he vouchsafed to me, and when he had slammed and bolted me out, I ran into the street and stood for some time behind the trunk of a big hickory, watching the followers of the North Wind.",

I made up my mind. “The son of the Great Chief knows that the Puans have wickedness in their hearts to-night,” I said; “the tongue of the Hungry Wolf does not lie.” The big Indian drew back with another grunt, and the distant firelight flashed on his eyes as on polished black flints. “Umrrhh! Is the Pale Face Chief’s son a prophet?” “The anger of the Pale Face Chief and of his countrymen is as the hurricane,” I said, scarce believing my own ears.

In the tiny kitchen a dozen men and a boy tried to hush their breathing, and sweltered. For it was very hot, and the pent-up odor of past cookings was stifling to men used to the open. In a corner, hooded under a box, was a lighted lantern, and Tom McChesney stood ready to seize it at the first alarm. On such occasions the current of time runs sluggish. Thrice our muscles were startled into tenseness by the baying of a hound, and once a cock crew out of all season. For the night was cloudy and pitchy black, and the dawn as far away as eternity. Suddenly I knew that every man in the room was on the alert, for the skilled frontiersman, when watchful, has a sixth sense. None of them might have told you what he had heard. The next sound was the faint creaking of Colonel Clark’s door as it opened. Wrapping a blanket around the lantern, Tom led the way, and we massed ourselves behind the front door. Another breathing space, and then the war-cry of the Puans broke hideously on the night, and children woke, crying, from their sleep. In two bounds our little detachment was in the street, the fire spouting red from the Deckards, faint, shadowy forms fading along the line of trees.",

The man at whose bidding this merrymaking was held stood in a corner watching with folded arms, and none to look at him might know that he was playing for a stake.

Their lives were spared, but to what purpose, since the White Chief looked with disfavor upon them? Let him know that bad men from Michilimackinac put the deed into their hearts. “When the Big Knives come upon such people in the wilderness,” Clark answered, “they shoot them down that they may not eat the deer.

Still they stood irresolute, their minds now bereft of expedients. And the young men sat motionless on the ground. As Clark talked they peered out from under their blankets, once, twice, thrice. He was still talking to the wondering Monsieur Gratiot. But no other voice was heard, and the eyes of all were turned on him in amazement. But at last, when the drama had risen to the pitch of unbearable suspense, he looked down upon the two miserable pyramids at his feet, and touched them. The blankets quivered. “Stand up,” said the Colonel, “and uncover.” They rose, cast the blankets from them, and stood with a stoic dignity awaiting his pleasure. Wonderful, fine-limbed men they were, and for the first time Clark’s eyes were seen to kindle.",

But Clark did not stop there. He presented them to Captain Bowman and to the French and Spanish gentlemen present, and they were hailed by their own kind as chiefs of their nation. To cap it all our troops, backwoodsmen and Creole militia, paraded in line on the common, and fired a salute in their honor. Thus did Clark gain the friendship of the forty tribes in the Northwest country.",

A peaceful autumn passed, and we were happy save when we thought of those we had left at home. There is no space here to tell of many incidents. Great chiefs who had not been to the council came hundreds of leagues across wide rivers that they might see with their own eyes this man who had made peace without gold, and these had to be amused and entertained. The apples ripened, and were shaken to the ground by the winds. The good Father Gibault, true to his promise, strove to teach me French. Indeed, I picked up much of that language in my intercourse with the inhabitants of Kaskaskia. How well I recall that simple life,--its dances, its songs, and the games with the laughing boys and girls on the common! And the good people were very kind to the orphan that dwelt with Colonel Clark, the drummer boy of his regiment. But winter brought forebodings. When the garden patches grew bare and brown, and the bleak winds from across the Mississippi swept over the common, untoward tidings came like water dripping from a roof, bit by bit. And day by day Colonel Clark looked graver. The messengers he had sent to Vincennes came not back, and the coureurs and traders from time to time brought rumors of a British force gathering like a thundercloud in the northeast.",

As for the inhabitants, some of them who had once bowed to us with a smile now passed with faces averted. The cold set the miry roads like cement, in ruts and ridges. A flurry of snow came and powdered the roofs even as the French loaves are powdered. It was January. There was Colonel Clark on a runt of an Indian pony; Tom McChesney on another, riding ahead, several French gentlemen seated on stools in a two-wheeled cart, and myself. We were going to Cahokia, and it was very cold, and when the tireless wheels bumped from ridge to gully, the gentlemen grabbed each other as they slid about, and laughed. All at once the merriment ceased, and looking forward we saw that Tom had leaped from his saddle and was bending over something in the snow. These chanced to be the footprints of some twenty men. The immediate result of this alarming discovery was that Tom went on express to warn Captain Bowman, and the rest of us returned to a painful scene at Kaskaskia. We reached the village, the French gentlemen leaped down from their stools in the cart, and in ten minutes the streets were filled with frenzied, hooded figures. Hamilton, called the Hair Buyer, was upon them with no less than six hundred, and he would hang them to their own gateposts for listening to the Long Knives. These were but a handful after all was said.",

Father Gibault would doubtless be exposed to the crows in the belfry of his own church because he had busied himself at Vincennes and with other matters. Father Gibault was human, and therefore lovable. He bade his parishioners a hasty and tearful farewell, and he made a cold and painful journey to the territories of his Spanish Majesty across the Mississippi. Father Gibault looked back, and against the gray of the winter’s twilight there were flames like red maple leaves. In the fort the men stood to their guns, their faces flushed with staring at the burning houses. Only a few were burned,--enough to give no cover for Hamilton and his six hundred if they came. But they did not come. The faithful Bowman and his men arrived instead, with the news that there had been only a roving party of forty, and these were now in full retreat. Father Gibault came back. But where was Hamilton? This was the disquieting thing. One bitter day, when the sun smiled mockingly on the powdered common, a horseman was perceived on the Fort Chartres road. It was Monsieur Vigo returning from Vincennes, but he had been first to St. Louis by reason of the value he set upon his head. Yes, Monsieur Vigo had been to Vincennes, remaining a little longer than he expected, the guest of Governor Hamilton. So Governor Hamilton had recaptured that place!

Eight hundred in all, said Monsieur Vigo, using his fingers. And it was Governor Hamilton’s design to march upon Kaskaskia and Cahokia and sweep over Kentucky; nay, he had already sent certain emissaries to McGillivray and his Creeks and the Southern Indians with presents, and these were to press forward on their side. The Governor could do nothing now, but would move as soon as the rigors of winter had somewhat relented. Monsieur Vigo shook his head and shrugged his shoulders. He loved les Américains. What would Monsieur le Colonel do now? Monsieur le Colonel was grave, but this was his usual manner. He did not tear his hair, but the ways of the Long Knives were past understanding. He asked many questions. How was it with the garrison at Vincennes? Monsieur Vigo was exact, as a business man should be. They were now reduced to eighty men, and five hundred savages had gone out to ravage. There was no chance, then, of Hamilton moving at present? Monsieur Vigo threw up his hands. Never had he made such a trip, and he had been forced to come back by a northern route. The Wabash was as the Great Lakes, and the forests grew out of the water. A fox could not go to Vincennes in this weather. A fish? Monsieur Vigo laughed heartily. Yes, a fish might.",

For, if we stay here, we shall be caught like bears in a trap, and Kentucky will be at Hamilton’s mercy.” “Sacré!” exclaimed Monsieur Vigo, “you are mad, mon ami. I know what this country is, and you cannot get to Vincennes.” “I will get to Vincennes,” said Colonel Clark, so gently that Monsieur Vigo knew he meant it. “I will swim to Vincennes.” Monsieur Vigo raised his hands to heaven. The three of us went out of the door and walked. There was a snowy place in front of the church all party-colored like a clown’s coat,--scarlet capotes, yellow capotes, and blue capotes, and bright silk handkerchiefs. They surrounded the Colonel. Pardieu, what was he to do now? For the British governor and his savages were coming to take revenge on them because, in their necessity, they had declared for Congress. Colonel Clark went silently on his way to the gate; but Monsieur Vigo stopped, and Kaskaskia heard, with a shock, that this man of iron was to march against Vincennes. The gates of the fort were shut, and the captains summoned. Undaunted woodsmen as they were, they were lukewarm, at first, at the idea of this march through the floods.",

Clark would not listen to Monsieur Vigo, and hence the financier had, perforce, to listen to Clark. There were several miracles before we left. Monsieur Vigo, for instance, agreed to pay the expenses of the expedition, though in his heart he thought we should never get to Vincennes. Incidentally, he was never repaid.

Clark took them all, and in due time it will be told how the colors took Vincennes. This was because Colonel Clark was a man of destiny. Furthermore, Colonel Clark was off the next morning at dawn to buy a Mississippi keel-boat. He had her rigged up with two four-pounders and four swivels, filled her with provisions, and called her the Willing. She was the first gunboat on the Western waters.

The snow had turned to rain, and Terence stood guard within the doorway. “Arrah,” he said, “what ails ye, darlin’?” I gulped and the tears sprang into my eyes; whereupon Terence, in defiance of all military laws, laid his gun against the doorpost and put his arms around me, and I confided my fears. It was at this critical juncture that the door opened and Colonel Clark came out. “What’s to do here?” he demanded, gazing at us sternly. “Savin’ your Honor’s prisence,” said Terence, “he’s afeard your Honor will be sending him on the boat.

Presently he spoke my name, and I stood before him. “I will give you a piece of advice, Davy,” said he. “If you want a thing, go straight to the man that has it. McChesney has spoken to me about this wild notion of yours of going to Vincennes, and Cowan and McCann and Ray and a dozen others have dogged my footsteps.” “I only spoke to Terence because he asked me, sir,” I answered. “I said nothing to any one else.” He laid down his pen and looked at me with an odd expression. “What a weird little piece you are,” he exclaimed; “you seem to have wormed your way into the hearts of these men. Do you know that you will probably never get to Vincennes alive?” “I don’t care, sir,” I said. A happy thought struck me. “If they see a boy going through the water, sir--” I hesitated, abashed. “What then?” said Clark, shortly. “It may keep some from going back,” I finished. At that he gave a sort of gasp, and stared at me the more. “Egad,” he said, “I believe the good Lord launched you wrong end to.

Ropes are cast off, the keel-boat pushes her blunt nose through the cold, muddy water, the oars churn up dirty, yellow foam, and cheers shake the sodden air. So the Willing left on her long journey: down the Kaskaskia, into the flood of the Mississippi, against many weary leagues of the Ohio’s current, and up the swollen Wabash until they were to come to the mouth of the White River near Vincennes. There they were to await us. Should we ever see them again? I think that this was the unspoken question in the hearts of the many who were to go by land. The 5th was a mild, gray day, with the melting snow lying in patches on the brown bluff, and the sun making shift to pierce here and there. We formed the regiment in the fort,--backwoodsman and Creole now to fight for their common country, Jacques and Pierre and Alphonse; and mother and father, sweetheart and wife, waiting to wave a last good-by. Bravely we marched out of the gate and into the church for Father Gibault’s blessing.

And so we came to the bleak ferry landing where we had crossed on that hot July night six months before.

We stood dismayed at the crumbling edge of the hill, and one hundred and seventy pairs of eyes were turned on Clark. With a mere glance at the running stream high on the bank and the drowned forest beyond, he turned and faced them. “I reckon you’ve earned a rest, boys,” he said. “We’ll have games to-day.” There were some dozen of the unflinching who needed not to be amused. Choosing a great poplar, these he set to hollowing out a pirogue, and himself came among the others and played leap-frog and the Indian game of ball until night fell.

The pirogue was filled with the weak, and in the end of it I was curled up with my drum. Heroism is a many-sided thing. It is one matter to fight and finish, another to endure hell’s tortures hour after hour. All day they waded with numbed feet vainly searching for a footing in the slime. Truly, the agony of a brave man is among the greatest of the world’s tragedies to see. As they splashed onward through the tree-trunks, many a joke went forth, though lips were drawn and teeth pounded together. I have not the heart to recall these jokes,--it would seem a sacrilege.

I shook my head, and the tears came into my eyes. “Come, Davy,” he said, “ye’re so little, and I beant hungry.” Again I shook my head, and for the life of me I could say nothing. “I reckon Polly Ann’d never forgive me if anything was to happen to you,” said he.",

Ye’ll not eat it for Polly Ann’s sake?” he asked coaxingly. “‘Twould not be serving her,” I answered indignantly. “Ye’re an obstinate little deevil!” he cried, and, dropping the morsel on the freshly cut stump, he stalked away. I ran after him, crying out, but he leaped on the raft that was already in the stream and began to pole across. I slipped the piece into my own hunting shirt. All day the men who were too weak to swing axes sat listless on the bank, watching in vain for some sight of the Willing. They saw a canoe rounding the bend instead, with a single occupant paddling madly. And who should this be but Captain Willing’s own brother, escaped from the fort, where he had been a prisoner. He told us that a man named Maisonville, with a party of Indians, was in pursuit of him, and the next piece of news he had was in the way of raising our despair a little. Governor Hamilton’s astonishment at seeing this force here and now would be as great as his own. Governor Hamilton had said, indeed, that only a navy could take Vincennes this year. Unfortunately, Mr. Willing brought no food.",

But as long as I live I shall never forget how Tom McChesney returned at nightfall, the hero of the hour. He had shot a deer; and never did wolves pick an animal cleaner. They pressed on me a choice piece of it, these great-hearted men who were willing to go hungry for the sake of a child, and when I refused it they would have forced it down my throat. Swein Poulsson, he that once hid under the bed, deserves a special tablet to his memory. He was for giving me all he had, though his little eyes were unnaturally bright and the red had left his cheeks now. “He haf no belly, only a leedle on his backbone!” he cried. “Begob, thin, he has the backbone,” said Terence. “I have a piece,” said I, and drew forth that which Tom had given me. They brought a quarter of a saddle to Colonel Clark, but he smiled at them kindly and told them to divide it amongst the weak. He looked at me as I sat with my feet crossed on the stump. “I will follow Davy’s example,” said he. At length the canoes were finished and we crossed the river, swimming over the few miserable skeletons of the French ponies we had brought along. We came to a sugar camp, and beyond it, stretching between us and Vincennes, was a sea of water. Here we made our camp, if camp it could be called. There was no fire, no food, and the water seeped out of the ground on which we lay.",

Morning found the men huddled like sheep, their hunting shirts hard as boards, and long before Hamilton’s gun we were up and stamping. Antoine poked the butt of his rifle through the ice of the lake in front of us. “I think we not get to Vincennes this day,” he said. Colonel Clark, who heard him, turned to me. “Fetch McChesney here, Davy,” he said. Tom came. “McChesney,” said he, “when I give the word, take Davy and his drum on your shoulders and follow me. And Davy, do you think you can sing that song you gave us the other night?” “Oh, yes, sir,” I answered. Without more ado the Colonel broke the skim of ice, and, taking some of the water in his hand, poured powder from his flask into it and rubbed it on his face until he was the color of an Indian. Stepping back, he raised his sword high in the air, and, shouting the Shawanee war-whoop, took a flying leap up to his thighs in the water. Tom swung me instantly to his shoulder and followed, I beating the charge with all my might, though my hands were so numb that I could scarce hold the sticks.

THE HAIR BUYER TRAPPED To lie the night on adamant, pierced by the needles of the frost; to awake shivering and famished, until the meaning of an inch of ice on the backwater comes to your mind,--these are not calculated to put a man into an equable mood to listen to oratory. Nevertheless there was a kind of oratory to fit the case. To picture the misery of these men is well-nigh impossible. They stood sluggishly in groups, dazed by suffering, and their faces were drawn and their eyes ringed, their beards and hair matted. And many found it in their hearts to curse Clark and that government for which he fought. When the red fire of the sun glowed through the bare branches that morning, it seemed as if the campaign had spent itself like an arrow which drops at the foot of the mark. Could life and interest and enthusiasm be infused again in such as these? I have ceased to marvel how it was done. A man no less haggard than the rest, but with a compelling force in his eyes, pointed with a blade to the hills across the river. They must get to them, he said, and their troubles would be ended. He said more, and they cheered him. These are the bare facts. He picked a man here, and another there, and these went silently to a grim duty behind the regiment. “If any try to go back, shoot them down!” he cried. Then with a gun-butt he shattered the ice and was the first to leap into the water under it.",

They followed him blindly, as men go to torture, but they followed him, and the splashing and crushing of the ice were sounds to freeze my body. I was put in a canoe. In my day I have beheld great suffering and hardship, and none of it compared to this. Torn with pity, I saw them reeling through the water, now grasping trees and bushes to try to keep their feet, the strongest breaking the way ahead and supporting the weak between them. More than once Clark himself tottered where he beat the ice at the apex of the line. Some swooned and would have drowned had they not been dragged across the canoe and chafed back to consciousness. By inches the water shallowed. Clark reached the high ground, and then Bill Cowan, with a man on each shoulder. Then others endured to the shallows to fall heavily in the crumbled ice and be dragged out before they died. But at length, by God’s grace, the whole regiment was on the land. Fires would not revive some, but Clark himself seized a fainting man by the arms and walked him up and down in the sunlight until his blood ran again. It was a glorious day, a day when the sap ran in the maples, and the sun soared upwards in a sky of the palest blue. All this we saw through the tracery of the leafless branches,--a mirthless, shivering crowd, crept through a hell of weather into the Hair Buyer’s very lair.",

In the towed canoe two fat and stolid squaws and a pappoose were huddled, and beside them--God be praised!--food. A piece of buffalo on its way to town, and in the end compartment of the boat tallow and bear’s grease lay revealed by two blows of the tomahawk. The kettles--long disused--were fetched, and broth made and fed in sips to the weakest, while the strongest looked on and smiled in an agony of self-restraint. It was a fearful thing to see men whose legs had refused service struggle to their feet when they had drunk the steaming, greasy mixture. And the Colonel, standing by the river’s edge, turned his face away--down-stream. And then, as often, I saw the other side of the man. Suddenly he looked at me, standing wistful at his side. “They have cursed me,” said he, by way of a question, “they have cursed me every day.” And seeing me silent, he insisted, “Tell me, is it not so, Davy?” “It is so,” I said, wondering that he should pry, “but it was while they suffered. And--and some refrained.” “And you?” he asked queerly. “I--I could not, sir. For I asked leave to come.” “If they have condemned me to a thousand hells,” said he, dispassionately, “I should not blame them.” Again he looked at me. “Do you understand what you have done?” he asked. “No, sir,” I said uneasily. “And yet there are some human qualities in you, Davy.

For the space of half an hour he stared down the river, and I knew that he was looking vainly for the Willing. At noon we crossed, piecemeal, a deep lake in the canoes, and marching awhile came to a timber-covered rise which our French prisoners named as the Warriors’ Island. And from the shelter of its trees we saw the steely lines of a score of low ponds, and over the tops of as many ridges a huddle of brown houses on the higher ground. And this was the place we had all but sold our lives to behold! This was Vincennes at last! We were on the heights behind the town,--we were at the back door, as it were. At the far side, on the Wabash River, was the front door, or Fort Sackville, where the banner of England snapped in the February breeze. We stood there, looking, as the afternoon light flooded the plain. Suddenly the silence was broken. “Hooray for Clark!” cried a man at the edge of the copse. “Hooray for Clark!”--it was the whole regiment this time. From execration to exaltation was but a step, after all. And the Creoles fell to scoffing at their sufferings and even forgot their hunger in staring at the goal.

Presently there was a drama performed for our delectation. A shot came down the wind, and we perceived that several innocent Creole gentlemen, unconscious of what the timber held, were shooting the ducks and geese. Whereupon Clark chose Antoine and three of our own Creoles to sally out and shoot likewise--as decoys. We watched them working their way over the ridges, and finally saw them coming back with one of the Vincennes sportsmen. I cannot begin to depict the astonishment of this man when he reached the copse, and was led before our lean, square-shouldered commander. Yes, monsieur, he was a friend of les Américains. Did Governor Hamilton know that a visit was imminent? Pardieu (with many shrugs and outward gestures of the palms), Governor Hamilton had said if the Long Knives had wings or fins they might reach him now--he was all unprepared. “Gentlemen,” said Colonel Clark to Captains Bowman and McCarty and Williams, “we have come so far by audacity, and we must continue by audacity.

What a stroke was this! There were six hundred men in the town and fort,--soldiers, inhabitants, and Indians,--while we had but 170, starved and weakened by their incredible march. But Clark was not to be daunted. Whipping out his field-glasses, he took a stand on a little mound under the trees and followed the fast-galloping messenger across the plain; saw him enter the town; saw the stir in the streets, knots of men riding out and gazing, hands on foreheads, towards the place where we were. But, as the minutes rolled into hours, there was no further alarm. No gun, no beat to quarters or bugle-call from Fort Sackville. What could it mean? Clark’s next move was an enigma, for he set the men to cutting and trimming tall sapling poles. To these were tied (how reverently!) the twenty stands of colors which loving Creole hands had stitched.

Surely a great force was there, a small part of which had been sent to play with him and his men.

I went forward an inch, then another and another down the slope, and at last I could have sworn that I saw dark blurs against the ground. I put out my hand, my weight went after, and I had crashed through a coating of ice up to my elbow in a pool. There came a second of sheer terror, a hoarse challenge in French, and then I took to my heels and flew towards the fort at the top of my speed. I heard them coming after me, leap and bound, and crying out to one another. Ahead of me there might have been a floor or a precipice, as the ground looks level at night. I hurt my foot cruelly on a frozen clod of earth, slid down the washed bank of a run into the Wabash, picked myself up, scrambled to the top of the far side, and had gotten away again when my pursuer shattered the ice behind me. A hundred yards more, two figures loomed up in front, and I was pulled up choking. “Hang to him, Fletcher!” said a voice. “Great God!” cried Fletcher, “it’s Davy. What are ye up to now?” “Let me go!” I cried, as soon as I had got my wind.",

They fairly shook out of me what had happened, and then dropped me with a war-whoop and started for the prairie, I after them, crying out to them to beware of the run. A man must indeed be fleet of foot to have escaped these young ruffians, and so it proved. When I reached the hollow there were the two of them fighting with a man in the water, the ice jangling as they shifted their feet. “What’s yere name?” said Fletcher, cuffing and kicking his prisoner until he cried out for mercy. “Maisonville,” said the man, whereupon Fletcher gave a war-whoop and kicked him again. “That’s no way to use a prisoner,” said I, hotly. “Hold your mouth, Davy,” said Fletcher, “you didn’t ketch him.” “You wouldn’t have had him but for me,” I retorted. Fletcher’s answer was an oath. They put Maisonville between them, ran him through the town up to the firing line, and there, to my horror, they tied him to a post and used him for a shield, despite his heart-rending yells. In mortal fear that the poor man would be shot down, I was running away to find some one who might have influence over them when I met a lieutenant. He came up and ordered them angrily to unbind Maisonville and bring him before the Colonel. Fletcher laughed, whipped out his hunting knife, and cut the thongs; but he and Willis had scarce got twenty paces from the officer before they seized poor Maisonville by the hair and made shift to scalp him.",

Persuaded, however, that his last hour was come, he made a desperate effort to clear himself, whereupon Fletcher cut off a piece of his skin by mistake. Maisonville, making sure that he had been scalped, stood groaning and clapping his hand to his head, while the two young rascals drew back and stared at each other. “What’s to do now?” said Willis. “Take our medicine, I reckon,” answered Fletcher, grimly. And they seized the tottering man between them, and marched him straightway to the fire where Clark stood. They had seen the Colonel angry before, but now they were fairly withered under his wrath. And he could have given them no greater punishment, for he took them from the firing line, and sent them back to wait among the reserves until the morning. “Nom de Dieu!” said Maisonville, wrathfully, as he watched them go, “they should hang.” “The stuff that brought them here through ice and flood is apt to boil over, Captain,” remarked the Colonel, dryly. “If you please, sir,” said I, “they did not mean to cut him, but he wriggled.” Clark turned sharply. “Eh?” said he, “did you have a hand in this, too?” “Peste!” cried the Captain, “the little ferret--you call him--he find me on the prairie. I run to catch him with some men and fall into the crick--” he pointed to his soaked leggings, “and your demons, they fall on top of me.” “I wish to heaven you had caught Lamothe instead, Davy,” said the Colonel, and joined despite himself in the laugh that went up.",

The circle about us deepened with eager listeners, who uttered exclamations when Maisonville, between his answers, put up his hand to his bleeding head. Suddenly the circle parted, and Captain Bowman came through. “Ray has discovered Lamothe, sir,” said he. “What shall we do?” “Let him into the fort,” said Clark, instantly. There was a murmur of astonished protest. “Let him into the fort!” exclaimed Bowman. “Certainly,” said the Colonel; “if he finds he cannot get in, he will be off before the dawn to assemble the tribes.” “But the fort is provisioned for a month,” Bowman expostulated; “and they must find out to-morrow how weak we are.” “To-morrow will be too late,” said Clark. “And suppose he shouldn’t go in?” “He will go in,” said the Colonel, quietly. “Withdraw your men, Captain, from the north side.” Captain Bowman departed. Whatever he may have thought of these orders, he was too faithful a friend of the Colonel’s to delay their execution. Murmuring, swearing oaths of astonishment, man after man on the firing line dropped his rifle at the word, and sullenly retreated.

And as we lay waiting on the hard ground, stiff and cold and hungry, talking in whispers, somewhere near six of the clock on that February morning the great square of Fort Sackville began to take shape. There was the long line of the stockade, the projecting blockhouses at each corner with peaked caps, and a higher capped square tower from the centre of the enclosure, the banner of England drooping there and clinging forlorn to its staff, as though with a presentiment. Then, as the light grew, the close-lipped casements were seen, scarred with our bullets. The little log houses of the town came out, the sapling palings and the bare trees,--all grim and gaunt at that cruel season. Cattle lowed here and there, and horses whinnied to be fed. It was a dirty, gray dawn, and we waited until it had done its best. From where we lay hid behind log house and palings we strained our eyes towards the prairie to see if Lamothe would take the bait, until our view was ended at the fuzzy top of a hillock. Bill Cowan, doubled up behind a woodpile and breathing heavily, nudged me. “Davy, Davy, what d’ye see!”. Was it a head that broke the line of the crest? Even as I stared, breathless, half a score of forms shot up and were running madly for the stockade. Twenty more broke after them, Indians and Frenchmen, dodging, swaying, crowding, looking fearfully to right and left.",

In plain view of our impatient Deckards soldiers manned the platform, and we saw that they were flinging down ladders. An officer in a faded scarlet coat stood out among the rest, shouting himself hoarse. Involuntarily Cowan lined his sights across the woodpile on this mark of color. Lamothe’s men, a seething mass, were fighting like wolves for the ladders, fearful yet that a volley might kill half of them where they stood. And so fast did they scramble upwards that the men before them stepped on their fingers. All at once and by acclamation the fierce war-whoops of our men rent the air, and some toppled in sheer terror and fell the twelve feet of the stockade at the sound of it. Then every man in the regiment, Creole and backwoodsman, lay back to laugh. The answer of the garrison was a defiant cheer, and those who had dropped, finding they were not shot at, picked themselves up again and gained the top, helping to pull the ladders after them. Bowman’s men swung back into place, the rattle and drag were heard in the blockhouse as the cannon were run out through the ports, and the battle which had held through the night watches began again with redoubled vigor. But there was more caution on the side of the British, for they had learned dearly how the Kentuckians could measure crack and crevice. There followed two hours and a futile waste of ammunition, the lead from the garrison flying harmless here and there, and not a patch of skin or cloth showing.",

Captain Bowman laughed loudly. “I reckon the boys will see to that,” said he. Colonel Clark folded the letter, addressed it, and turned gravely to Monsieur Bouton. “You will oblige me, sir,” said he, “by taking this to Governor Hamilton. You will be provided with a flag of truce.” Monsieur Bouton was a round little man, as his name suggested, and the men cheered him as he strode soberly up the street, a piece of sheeting tied to a sapling and flung over his shoulder. Through such humble agencies are the ends of Providence accomplished. Monsieur Bouton walked up to the gate, disappeared sidewise through the postern, and we sat down to breakfast. In a very short time Monsieur Bouton was seen coming back, and his face was not so impassive that the governor’s message could not be read thereon. “‘Tis not a love-letter he has, I’ll warrant,” said Terence, as the little man disappeared into the house.",

Such was the deadliness of their aim that scarce a shot came back, and time and again I saw men fling themselves in front of the breastworks with a war-whoop, wave their rifles in the air, and cry out that they would have the Ha’r Buyer’s sculp before night should fall. It could not last. Not tuned to the nicer courtesies of warfare, the memory of Hamilton’s war parties, of blackened homes, of families dead and missing, raged unappeased. These were not content to leave vengeance in the Lord’s hands, and when a white flag peeped timorously above the gate a great yell of derision went up from river-bank to river-bank. Out of the postern stepped the officer with the faded scarlet coat, and in due time went back again, haughtily, his head high, casting contempt right and left of him. Again the postern opened, and this time there was a cheer at sight of a man in hunting shirt and leggings and coonskin cap.

There was Colonel Clark waiting at the door through which the good Creoles had been wont to go to worship, bowing somewhat ironically to the British General. It was a strange meeting they had in St. Xavier’s, by the light of the candles on the altar. Hot words passed in that house of peace, the General demanding protection for all his men, and our Colonel replying that he would do with the Indian partisans as he chose. “And whom mean you by Indian partisans?” the undaunted governor had demanded. “I take Major Hay to be one of them,” our Colonel had answered. It was soon a matter of common report how Clark had gazed fixedly at the Major when he said this, and how the Major turned pale and trembled. With our own eyes we saw them coming out, Major Hay as near to staggering as a man could be, the governor blushing red for shame of him. So they went sorrowfully back to the gate. Colonel Clark stood at the steps of the church, looking after them. “What was that firing?” he demanded sharply. “I gave orders for a truce.” We who stood by the church had indeed heard firing in the direction of the hills east of the town, and had wondered thereat.",

Captain Williams had gone out with his company to meet them, had lured them on, and finally had killed a number and was returning with the prisoners. Yes, here they were! Williams himself walked ahead with two dishevelled and frightened coureurs du bois, twoscore at least of the townspeople of Vincennes, friends and relatives of the prisoners, pressing about and crying out to Williams to have mercy on them. As for Williams, he took them in to the Colonel, the townspeople pressing into the door-yard and banking in front of it on the street. Behind all a tragedy impended, nor can I think of it now without sickening. The frightened Creoles in the street gave back against the fence, and from behind them, issuing as a storm-cloud, came the half of Williams’ company, yelling like madmen. Pushed and jostled ahead of them were four Indians, decked and feathered, the half-dried scalps dangling from their belts, impassive, true to their creed despite the indignity of jolts and jars and blows.

I thought ye’d be a wizened little body, but this year ye’ve shot up like a cornstalk.” “My father was six feet two inches in his moccasins,” I said. “He’ll be wallopin’ me soon,” said Tom, with a grin. He took a long whiff at his pipe, and added thoughtfully, “I reckon this ain’t no place fer me now, with all the settler folks and land-grabbers comin’ through the Gap.” “Tom,” said I, “there’s a bit of a fall on the river here.” “Ay,” he said, “and nary a fish left.” “Something better,” I answered; “we’ll put a dam there and a mill and a hominy pounder.” “And make our fortune grinding corn for the settlers,” cried Polly Ann, showing a line of very white teeth.",

And he allowed that he would have the more time to hunt if the mill were a success. For a month I had had the scheme in my mind, where the dam was to be put, the race, and the wondrous wheel rimmed with cow horns to dip the water. And fixed on the wheel there was to be a crank that worked the pounder in the mortar. So we were to grind until I could arrange with Mr. Scarlett, the new storekeeper in Harrodstown, to have two grinding-stones fetched across the mountains. While the corn ripened and the melons swelled and the flax flowered, our axes rang by the river’s side; and sometimes, as we worked, Cowan and Terrell and McCann and other Long Hunters would come and jeer good-naturedly because we were turning civilized. Often they gave us a lift. It was September when the millstones arrived, and I spent a joyous morning of final bargaining with Mr. Myron Scarlett. This Mr. Scarlett was from Connecticut, had been a quartermaster in the army, and at much risk brought ploughs and hardware, and scissors and buttons, and broadcloth and corduroy, across the Alleghanies, and down the Ohio in flatboats. These he sold at great profit. We had no money, not even the worthless scrip that Congress issued; but a beaver skin was worth eighteen shillings, a bearskin ten, and a fox or a deer or a wildcat less.",

It was just a windowless log house built outside the walls, our temple of avarice. The case was this: Henderson (for whose company Daniel Boone cut the wilderness road) believed that he had bought the country, and issued grants therefor. Tom held one of these grants, alas, and many others whom I knew. Virginia repudiated Henderson. Keen-faced speculators bought acre upon acre and tract upon tract from the State, and crossed the mountains to extort. Claims conflicted, titles lapped. There was the court set in the sunlight in the midst of a fair land, held by the shameless, thronged day after day by the homeless and the needy, jostling, quarrelling, beseeching. Even as I looked upon this strife a man stood beside me. “Drat ‘em,” said the stranger, as he watched a hawk-eyed extortioner in drab, for these did not condescend to hunting shirts, “drat ‘em, ef I had my way I’d wring the neck of every mother’s son of ‘em.” I turned with a start, and there was Mr. Daniel Boone. “Howdy, Davy,” he said; “ye’ve growed some sence ye’ve ben with Clark.” He paused, and then continued in the same strain: “‘Tis the same at Boonesboro and up thar at the Falls settlement. The critters is everywhar, robbin’ men of their claims. Davy,” said Mr. Boone, earnestly, “you know that I come into Kaintuckee when it waren’t nothin’ but wilderness, and resked my life time and again.",

I’m good for nothin’ but shootin’ and explorin’.” We stood silent for a while, our attention caught by a quarrel which had suddenly come out of the doorway. One of the men was Jim Willis,--my friend of Clark’s campaign,--who had a Henderson claim near Shawanee Springs. The other was the hawk-eyed man of whom Mr. Boone had spoken, and fragments of their curses reached us where we stood. The hunting shirts surged around them, alert now at the prospect of a fight; men came running in from all directions, and shouts of “Hang him! Tomahawk him!” were heard on every side. Mr. Boone did not move. It was a common enough spectacle for him, and he was not excitable.",

Campbell was out arter him for a week with a coil of rope on his saddle. But the varmint got to cover.” Mr. Boone wished me luck in my new enterprise, bade me good-by, and set out for Redstone, where he was to measure a tract for a Revolutioner. The speculator having been rescued from Jim Willis’s clutches by the sheriff, the crowd good-naturedly helped us load our stones between pack-horses, and some of them followed us all the way home that they might see the grinding. Half of McAfee’s new station had heard the news, and came over likewise. And from that day we ground as much corn as could be brought to us from miles around. Polly Ann and I ran the mill and kept the accounts. Often of a crisp autumn morning we heard a gobble-gobble above the tumbling of the water and found a wild turkey perched on top of the hopper, eating his fill. Some of our meat we got that way. As for Tom, he was off and on. When the roving spirit seized him he made journeys to the westward with Cowan and Ray. Generally they returned with packs of skins.

I mention this, not alone because I remember well the day of his return, but because of a certain happening then that had a heavy influence on my after life. The episode deals with an easy-mannered gentleman named Potts, who was the agent for a certain Major Colfax of Virginia. Tom owned under a Henderson grant; the Major had been given this and other lands for his services in the war. Mr. Potts arrived one rainy afternoon and found me standing alone under the little lean-to that covered the hopper. How we served him, with the aid of McCann and Cowan and other neighbors, and how we were near getting into trouble because of the prank, will be seen later. The next morning I rode into Harrodstown not wholly easy in my mind concerning the wisdom of the thing I had done. There was no one to advise me, for Colonel Clark was far away, building a fort on the banks of the Mississippi. Tom had laughed at the consequences; he cared little about his land, and was for moving into the Wilderness again. But for Polly Ann’s sake I wished that we had treated the land agent less cavalierly. I was soon distracted from these thoughts by the sight of Harrodstown itself. I had no sooner ridden out of the forest shade when I saw that the place was in an uproar, men and women gathering in groups and running here and there between the cabins.",

Kentucky can go to the devil, half the stations be wiped out, and not a thrip do they care.” “Have you sent word to the Colonel?” I asked. “If he was here,” said Ray, bitterly, “he’d have half of ‘em swinging inside of an hour. I’ll warrant he’d send ‘em to the right-about.” I rode on into the town, Potts gone out of my mind. Apart from the land-office crowds, and looking on in silent rage, stood a group of the old settlers,--tall, lean, powerful, yet impotent for lack of a leader. A contrast they were, these buckskin-clad pioneers, to the ill-assorted humanity they watched, absorbed in struggles for the very lands they had won. “By the eternal!” said Jack Terrell, “if the yea’th was ter swaller ‘em up, they’d keep on a-dickerin’ in hell.” “Something’s got to be done,” Captain Harrod put in gloomily; “the red varmints ‘ll be on us in another day.

While there was money to be made or land to be got they had no ear for the public weal. A man shouldered his way through, roughly, and they gave back, cursing, surprised.

Behind us little Tom stirred in his sleep and startled us. That very evening Polly Ann had frightened him into obedience by telling him that the Shawanees would get him. What was there to do? McAfee’s Station was four miles away, and Ray’s clearing two. Ray was gone with Tom. I could not leave Polly Ann alone. There was nothing for it but to wait.

Listening intently, I thought it came from the side of the cabin where the lean-to was, where we stored our wood in winter. The black shadow fell on that side, and into a patch of bushes; peering out of the loophole, I could perceive nothing there. The noise went on at intervals. All at once there grew on me, with horror, the discovery that there was digging under the cabin. How long the sound continued I know not,--it might have been an hour, it might have been less.

At the sound of that voice I caught my breath. “What a pastoral! Harry, if we have sought for virtue in the wilderness, we have found it.” “When have we ever sought for virtue, Sarah?” It was the man who answered and stirred another chord of my memory. “When, indeed!” said the woman; “‘tis a luxury that is denied us, I fear me.” “Egad, we have run the gamut, all but that.” I thought the woman sighed. “Our hosts are gone out,” she said, “bless their simple souls! ‘Tis Arcady, Harry, ‘where thieves do not break in and steal.’ That’s Biblical, isn’t it?” She paused, and joined in the man’s laugh. “I remember--” She stopped abruptly. “Thieves!” said he, “not in our sense. And yet a fortnight ago this sylvan retreat was the scene of murder and sudden death.” “Yes, Indians,” said the woman; “but they are beaten off and forgotten. Troubles do not last here. Did you see the boy? He’s in there, in the corner, getting well of a fearful hacking. Mrs. McChesney says he saved her and her brats.” “Ay, McChesney told me,” said the man. “Let’s have a peep at him.” In they came, and I looked on the woman, and would have leaped from my bed had the strength been in me.",

Little, dark-pencilled lines under the eyes were nigh robbing these of the haughtiness I had once seen and hated. Set high on her hair was a curving, green hat with a feather, ill-suited to the wilderness. I looked on the man. He was as ill-equipped as she. A London tailor must have cut his suit of gray. A single band of linen, soiled by the journey, was wound about his throat, and I remember oddly the buttons stuck on his knees and cuffs, and these silk-embroidered in a criss-cross pattern of lighter gray. Some had been torn off. As for his face, ‘twas as handsome as ever, for dissipation sat well upon it. My thoughts flew back to that day long gone when a friendless boy rode up a long drive to a pillared mansion. I saw again the picture. The horse with the craning neck, the liveried servant at the bridle, the listless young gentleman with the shiny boots reclining on the horse-block, and above him, under the portico, the grand lady whose laugh had made me sad. And I remembered, too, the wild, neglected lad who had been to me as a brother, warm-hearted and generous, who had shared what he had with a foundling, who had wept with me in my first great sorrow. Where was he? For I was face to face once more with Mrs.",

I have heard you say so a dozen times.” She turned upon him an appealing glance. “Oh!” she said, with a little catch of her breath, “is there no such thing as oblivion? Is there a place in the world that is not haunted? I am cursed with memory.” “Or the lack of it,” answered Mr. Riddle, pulling out a silver snuff-box from his pocket and staring at it ruefully. “Damme, the snuff I fetched from Paris is gone, all but a pinch. Here is a real tragedy.” “It was the same in Rome,” the lady continued, unheeding, “when we met the Izards, and at Venice that nasty Colonel Tarleton saw us at the opera. In London we must needs run into the Manners from Maryland. In Paris--” “In Paris we were safe enough,” Mr. Riddle threw in hastily. “And why?” she flashed back at him. He did not answer that. “A truce with your fancies, madam,” said he. “Behold a soul of good nature! I have followed you through half the civilized countries of the globe--none of them are good enough. You must needs cross the ocean again, and come to the wilds.

And if my life had depended upon speaking, I could have found no fit words then. She turned from me, and her mood changed swiftly. For she laughed lightly, musically, and put a hand on his shoulder. “Perchance I am ghost-ridden,” she said. “They are not ghosts of a past happiness, at all events,” he answered. She sat down on a stool before the hearth, and clasping her fingers upon her knee looked thoughtfully into the embers of the fire. Presently she began to speak in a low, even voice, he looking down at her, his feet apart, his hand thrust backward towards the heat. “Harry,” she said, “do you remember all our contrivances? How you used to hold my hand in the garden under the table, while I talked brazenly to Mr. Mason? And how jealous Jack Temple used to get?” She laughed again, softly, always looking at the fire. “Damnably jealous!” agreed Mr. Riddle, and yawned. “Served him devilish right for marrying you. And he was a blind fool for five long years.” “Yes, blind,” the lady agreed. “How could he have been so blind?",

But, damn it, the Rebels have spoiled all that since the war.” “Those are not the regrets I mean,” answered Mrs. Temple. “What then, in Heaven’s name?” he cried. “You were not wont to be thus.

A sound broke the afternoon stillness,--the pattering of small, bare feet on the puncheons. A tremor shook the woman’s shoulders, and little Tom stood before her, a quaint figure in a butternut smock, his blue eyes questioning. He laid a hand on her arm. Then a strange thing happened. With a sudden impulse she turned and flung her arms about the boy and strained him to her, and kissed his brown hair. He struggled, but when she released him he sat very still on her knee, looking into her face. For he was a solemn child. The lady smiled at him, and there were two splashes like raindrops on her fair cheeks. As for Mr. Riddle, he went to the door, looked out, and took a last pinch of snuff. “Here is the mistress of the house coming back,” he cried, “and singing like the shepherdess in the opera.” It was Polly Ann indeed.",

Westward rolled the tide of emigrants to change her character, but to swell her power. Towns and settlements sprang up in a season and flourished, and a man could scarce keep pace with the growth of them. Doctors came, and ministers, and lawyers; generals and majors, and captains and subalterns of the Revolution, to till their grants and to found families. There were gentry, too, from the tide-waters, come to retrieve the fortunes which they had lost by their patriotism. There were storekeepers like Mr. Scarlett, adventurers and ne’er-do-weels who hoped to start with a clean slate, and a host of lazy vagrants who thought to scratch the soil and find abundance. I must not forget how, at the age of seventeen, I became a landowner, thanks to my name being on the roll of Colonel Clark’s regiment. For, in a spirit of munificence, the Assembly of the Commonwealth of Virginia had awarded to every private in that regiment one hundred and eight acres of land on the Ohio River, north of the Falls. Sergeant Thomas McChesney, as a reward for his services in one of the severest campaigns in history, received a grant of two hundred and sixteen acres! You who will may look at the plat made by William Clark, Surveyor for the Board of Commissioners, and find sixteen acres marked for Thomas McChesney in Section 169, and two hundred more in Section 3.",

Up rides a man named Jarrott, flings himself from his horse, passes the time of day as he watches the grinding, helps Tom to tie up a sack or two, and hands him a paper. “What’s this?” says Tom, staring at it blankly. “Ye won’t blame me, Mac,” answers Mr. Jarrott, somewhat ashamed of his rôle of process-server. “‘Tain’t none of my doin’s.” “Read it, Davy,” said Tom, giving it to me. I stopped the mill, and, unfolding the paper, read. I remember not the quaint wording of it, save that it was ill-spelled and ill-writ generally. In short, it was a summons for Tom to appear before the court at Danville on a certain day in the following week, and I made out that a Mr. Neville Colfax was the plaintiff in the matter, and that the suit had to do with land. “Neville Colfax!” I exclaimed, “that’s the man for whom Mr.",

Perchance Tom would have to pay for this prank likewise. ‘Twas indeed a foolish, childish thing to have done, and I might have known that it would only have put off the evil day of reckoning.

There was a temple built to her “of hewed or sawed logs nine inches thick”--so said the specifications. Within the temple was a rude platform which served as a bar, and since Justice is supposed to carry a torch in her hand, there were no windows,--nor any windows in the jail next door, where some dozen offenders languished on the afternoon that Tom and I rode into town.

I don’t know nothin’ about this newfangled law, but ‘tis a queer thing to my thinkin’ if them that fit fer a place ain’t got the fust right to it.” Major Colfax turned to Colonel Clark with marked impatience. “I told you it would be useless, Clark,” said he. “I care not a fig for a few paltry acres, and as God hears me I’m a reasonable man.” (He did not look it then.) “But I swear by the evangels I’ll let no squatter have the better of me. I did not serve Virginia for gold or land, but I lost my fortune in that service, and before I know it these backwoodsmen will have every acre of my grant.",

By God, I’ll not be frightened or wheedled out of mine. I sent an agent to Kentucky to deal politely and reasonably with these gentry. What did they do to him? Some of them threw him out neck and crop. And if I am not mistaken,” said Major Colfax, fixing a piercing eye upon Tom, “if I am not mistaken, it was this worthy sergeant of yours who came near to hanging him, and made the poor devil flee Kentucky for his life.” This remark brought me near to an untimely laugh at the remembrance of Mr. Potts, and this though I was far too sober over the outcome of the conference. Colonel Clark seized hold of a chair and pushed it under Major Colfax. “Sit down, gentlemen, we are not so far apart,” said the Colonel, coolly. The slovenly negro lad passing at that time, he caught him by the sleeve. “Here, boy, a bowl of toddy, quick. And mind you brew it strong. Now, Tom,” said he, “what is this fine tale about a hanging?” “‘Twan’t nothin’,” said Tom. “You tell me you didn’t try to hang Mr. Potts!” cried Major Colfax. “I tell you nothin’,” said Tom, and his jaw was set more stubbornly than ever. Major Colfax glanced at Colonel Clark. “You see!” he said a little triumphantly. I could hold my tongue no longer. “Major Colfax is unjust, sir,” I cried. “‘Twas Tom saved the man from hanging.” “Eh?” says Colonel Clark, turning to me sharply.",

At the end of this conversation he took my breath away by bidding me come to live with him. Like many lawyers of that time, he had a little house in one corner of his grounds for his office. It stood under great spreading trees, and there I was wont to sit through many a summer day wrestling with the authorities. In the evenings we would have political arguments, for the Confederacy was in a seething state between the Federalists and the Republicans over the new Constitution, now ratified. Between the Federalists and the Jacobins, I would better say, for the virulence of the French Revolution was soon to be reflected among the parties on our side.

One Colonel Tipton led these loyalist forces, and armed partisans of either side had for some years ridden up and down the length of the land, burning and pillaging and slaying. We in Virginia had heard of two sets of courts in Franklin, of two sets of legislators.

There was a great, black-bearded mountaineer-farmer-desperado in the midst of a circle, pouring out a torrent of abuse at a tall young man. “That thar’s Hump Gibson,” said the landlord, genially pointing out the black-bearded ruffian, “and the young lawyer feller hez git a jedgment ag’in him. He’s got spunk, but I reckon Hump ‘ll t’ar the innards out’n him ef he stands thar a great while.” “Ye’ll git jedgment ag’in me, ye Caroliny splinter, will ye?” yelled Mr. Gibson, with an oath. “I’ll pay Bill Wilder the skins when I git ready, and all the pinhook lawyers in Washington County won’t budge me a mite.” “You’ll pay Bill Wilder or go to jail, by the eternal,” cried the young man, quite as angrily, whereupon I looked upon him with a mixture of admiration and commiseration, with a gulping certainty in my throat that I was about to see murder done. He was a strange young man, with the rare marked look that would compel even a poor memory to pick him out again. For example, he was very tall and very slim, with red hair blown every which way over a high and towering forehead that seemed as long as the face under it. The face, too, was long, and all freckled by the weather. The blue eyes held me in wonder, and these blazed with such prodigious wrath that, if a look could have killed, Hump Gibson would have been stricken on the spot.",

I, who had looked upon cruel sights in my day, was turning away with a kind of sickening when I saw the slim young man dodge the rush. He did more. With two strides of his long legs he reached the fence, ripped off the topmost rail, and his huge antagonist, having changed his direction and coming at him with a bellow, was met with the point of a scantling in the pit of his stomach, and Mr. Gibson fell heavily to the ground. It had all happened in a twinkling, and there was a moment’s lull while the minds of the onlookers needed readjustment, and then they gave vent to ecstasies of delight. “Great Goliah!” cried the landlord, breathlessly, “he shet him up jest like a jack-knife.” Awe-struck, I looked at the tall young man, and he was the very essence of wrath. Unmindful of the plaudits, he stood brandishing the fence-rail over the great, writhing figure on the ground. And he was slobbering. I recall that this fact gave a twinge to something in my memory. “Come on, Hump Gibson,” he cried, “come on!”--at which the crowd went wild with pure joy. Witticisms flew. “Thought ye was goin’ to eat ‘im up, Hump?” said a friend. “Ye ain’t hed yer meal yet, Hump,” reminded another.

And I recalled with a smile my own fierce struggle at the schoolhouse with the same boy, and how his slobbering had been my salvation. I turned and went in after him with the landlord, who was rubbing his hands with glee. “I reckon Hump won’t come crowin’ round heah any more co’t days, Mr. Jackson,” said our host. But Mr. Jackson swept the room with his eyes and then glared at the landlord so that he gave back. “Where’s my man?” he demanded. “Your man, Mr. Jackson?” stammered the host. “Great Jehovah!” cried Mr. Jackson, “I believe he’s afraid to race.

I made up my mind one night that if I could pay my debts and get out of Charlestown I would go into the back country and study law and sober down. There was a Mr. Braiden in the ordinary who staked me two hundred dollars at rattle-and-snap against my horse. Gad, sir, that was providence. I won.

But the night was dark, the country unknown to me, and heavily wooded and mountainous. In addition to these things my mind ran like fire. My thoughts sometimes flew back to the wondrous summer evening when I trod the Nollichucky trace with Tom and Polly Ann, when I first looked down upon the log palace of that prince of the border, John Sevier. Well I remembered him, broad-shouldered, handsome, gay, a courtier in buckskin. Small wonder he was idolized by the Watauga settlers, that he had been their leader in the struggle of Franklin for liberty. And small wonder that Nick Temple should be in his following. Nick! My mind was in a torment concerning him. What of his mother? Should I speak of having seen her? I went blindly through the woods for hours after the night fell, my horse stumbling and weary, until at length I came to a lonely clearing on the mountain side, and a fierce pack of dogs dashed barking at my horse’s heels. There was a dark cabin ahead, indistinct in the starlight, and there I knocked until a gruff voice answered me and a tousled man came to the door. Yes, I had missed the trail. He shook his head when I asked for the Widow Brown’s, and bade me share his bed for the night. No, I would go on, I was used to the backwoods. Thereupon he thawed a little, kicked the dogs, and pointed to where the mountain dipped against the star-studded sky.",

Once the fear had settled deeply of missing Nick at the Widow Brown’s, I put my mind on my journey, and thanks to my early training I was able to keep the trail. It doubled around the spurs, forded stony brooks in diagonals, and often in the darkness of the mountain forest I had to feel for the blazes on the trees. There was no making time. I gained the notch with the small hours of the morning, started on with the descent, crisscrossing, following a stream here and a stream there, until at length the song of the higher waters ceased and I knew that I was in the valley. Suddenly there was no crown-cover over my head. I had gained the road once more, and I followed it hopefully, avoiding the stumps and the deep wagon ruts where the ground was spongy. The morning light revealed a milky mist through which the trees showed like phantoms. Then there came stains upon the mist of royal purple, of scarlet, of yellow like a mandarin’s robe, peeps of deep blue fading into azure as the mist lifted. The fiery eye of the sun was cocked over the crest, and beyond me I saw a house with its logs all golden brown in the level rays, the withered cornstalks orange among the blackened stumps. My horse stopped of his own will at the edge of the clearing. A cock crew, a lean hound prostrate on the porch of the house rose to his haunches, sniffed, growled, leaped down, and ran to the road and sniffed again.",

The hoof-beats grew louder, and then the hound in the road gave tongue to the short, sharp bark that is the call to arms. Other dogs, hitherto unseen, took up the cry, and turning in my saddle I saw a body of men riding hard at me through the alley in the forest. At their head, on a heavy, strong-legged horse, was one who might have stood for the figure of turbulence, and I made no doubt that this was Colonel Tipton himself,--Colonel Tipton, once secessionist, now champion of the Old North State and arch-enemy of John Sevier. At sight of me he reined up so violently that his horse went back on his haunches, and the men behind were near overriding him. “Look out, boys,” he shouted, with a fierce oath, “they’ve got guards out!” He flung back one hand to his holster for a pistol, while the other reached for the powder flask at his belt. He primed the pan, and, seeing me immovable, set his horse forward at an amble, his pistol at the cock. “Who in hell are you?” he cried. “A traveller from Virginia,” I answered. “And what are you doing here?” he demanded, with another oath. “I have just this moment come here,” said I, as calmly as I might. “I lost the trail in the darkness.” He glared at me, purpling, perplexed.",

And then we saw in the open door the figure of a woman shading her eyes with her hand. We pulled up, five of us, before the porch in front of her. “Good morning, Mrs. Brown,” said Tipton, gruffly. “Good morning, Colonel,” answered the widow. Tipton leaped from his horse, flung the bridle to a companion, and put his foot on the edge of the porch to mount. Then a strange thing happened. The lady turned deftly, seized a chair from within, and pulled it across the threshold. She sat herself down firmly, an expression on her face which hinted that the late lamented Mr. Brown had been a dominated man. Colonel Tipton stopped, staggering from the very impetus of his charge, and gazed at her blankly. “I have come for Colonel Sevier,” he blurted. And then, his anger rising, “I will have no trifling, ma’am. He is in this house.” “La! you don’t tell me,” answered the widow, in a tone that was wholly conversational. “He is in this house,” shouted the Colonel. “I reckon you’ve guessed wrong, Colonel,” said the widow.

His new tone was apologetic but firm. “I regret to have to do so, ma’am,” said he, “but both sexes are equal before the law.” “The law!” repeated the widow, seemingly tickled at the word. She smiled indulgently at the Colonel. “What a pity, Mr. Tipton, that the law compels you to arrest such a good friend of yours as Colonel Sevier. What self-sacrifice, Colonel Tipton! What nobility!” There was a second titter behind him, whereat he swung round quickly, and the crimson veins in his face looked as if they must burst. He saw me with my hand over my mouth. “You warned him, damn you!” he shouted, and turning again leaped to the porch and tried to squeeze past the widow into the house. “How dare you, sir?” she shrieked, giving him a vigorous push backwards. The four of us, his three men and myself, laughed outright. Tipton’s rage leaped its bounds. He returned to the attack again and again, and yet at the crucial moment his courage would fail him and he would let the widow thrust him back.

Tipton snatched from his belt the pistol which he might have used on me, and there flashed through my head the thought that some powder might yet be held in its pan. We cried out, all of us, his men, the widow, and myself,--all save Sevier, who stood quietly, smiling.

Nor did he say it angrily. I marked for the first time that he held a pistol in his slim fingers.

What he said we didn’t hear. The astonishing thing was that neither of them for the moment paid any attention to the infuriated man beside them. I saw Nick’s expression change.

Gradually, in the midst of this mad uproar, the crowd became aware that another man was standing upon the stump from which Nicholas Temple had leaped. “Cozby!” some one yelled, “Cozby!” The cry was taken up. “Huzzay for Cozby! He’ll lead us into Caroliny.” He was the huge, swarthy man I had seen riding hard with Nick that morning. A sculptor might have chosen his face and frame for a type of the iron-handed leader of pioneers. Will was supreme in the great features,--inflexible, indomitable will. His hunting shirt was open across his great chest, his black hair fell to his shoulders, and he stood with a compelling hand raised for silence. And when he spoke, slowly, resonantly, men fell back before his words. “I admire Mr. Temple’s courage, and above all his loyalty to our beloved General,” said Major Cozby. “But Mr. Temple is young, and the heated counsels of youth must not prevail. My friends, in order to save Jack Sevier we must be moderate.” His voice, strong as it was, was lost. “To hell with moderation!” they shouted. “Down with North Carolina! We’ll fight her!” He got silence again by the magnetic strength he had in him.",

Leave his rescue to me, and I will get him for you.” He paused, and they were stilled perforce. “I will get him for you,” he repeated slowly, “or North Carolina will pay for the burial of James Cozby.” There was an instant when they might have swung either way. “How will ye do it?” came in a thin, piping voice from somewhere near the stump. It may have been this that turned their minds. Others took up the question, “How will ye do it, Major Cozby?” “I don’t know,” cried the Major, “I don’t know. And if I did know, I wouldn’t tell you. But I will get Nollichucky Jack if I have to burn Morganton and rake the General out of the cinders!” Five hundred hands flew up, five hundred voices cried, “I’m with ye, Major Cozby!” But the Major only shook his head and smiled. What he said was lost in the roar. Fighting my way forward, I saw him get down from the stump, put his hand kindly on Nick’s shoulder, and lead him into the court-house. They were followed by a score of others, and the door was shut behind them. It was then I bethought myself of the letter to Mr. Wright, and I sought for some one who would listen to my questions as to his whereabouts. At length the man himself was pointed out to me, haranguing an excited crowd of partisans in front of his own gate.",

The town was full, and though he had several friends staying in his house I should join them. Was my horse fed? Dinner had been forgotten that day, but would I enter and partake? In short, I found myself suddenly provided for, and I lost no time in getting my weary mount into Mr. Wright’s little stable. And then I sat down, with several other gentlemen, at Mr. Wright’s board, where there was much guessing as to Major Cozby’s plan. “No other man west of the mountains could have calmed that crowd after that young daredevil Temple had stirred them up,” declared Mr. Wright. I ventured to say that I had business with Mr. Temple. “Faith, then, I will invite him here,” said my host. “But I warn you, Mr. Ritchie, that he is a trigger set on the hair. If he does not fancy you, he may quarrel with you and shoot you. And he is in no temper to bectrifled with to-day.” “I am not an easy person to quarrel with,” I answered. “To look at you, I shouldn’t say that you were,” said he. “We are going to the court-house, and I will see if I can get a word with the young Hotspur and send him to you.",

He stopped before the house and stared at me with a fine insolence, and I wondered whether I myself had not been too hasty in reclaiming him. A greeting died on my lips. “Well, sir” he said, “so you are the gentleman who has been dogging me all day.” “I dog no one, Mr. Temple,” I replied bitterly. “We’ll not quibble about words,” said he. “Would it be impertinent to ask your business--and perhaps your name?” “Did not Mr. Wright give you my name?” I exclaimed. “He might have mentioned it, I did not hear. Is it of such importance?” At that I lost my temper entirely. “It may be, and it may not,” I retorted. “I am David Ritchie.” He changed before my eyes as he stared at me, and then, ere I knew it, he had me by both arms, crying out:-- “David Ritchie! My Davy--who ran away from me--and we were going to Kentucky together. Oh, I have never forgiven you,”--the smile that there was no resisting belied his words as he put his face close to mine--“I never will forgive you.

I rode out the Wilderness Trail, fell in with other travellers, was welcomed by certain old familiar faces at Harrodstown, and pressed on. I have a vivid recollection of a beloved, vigorous figure swooping out of a cabin door and scattering a brood of children right and left. “Polly Ann!” I said, and she halted, trembling. “Tom,” she cried, “Tom, it’s Davy come back;” and Tom himself flew out of the door, ramrod in one hand and rifle in the other. Never shall I forget them as they stood there, he grinning with sheer joy as of yore, and she, with her hair flying and her blue gown snapping in the wind, in a tremor between tears and laughter. I leaped to the ground, and she hugged me in her arms as though I had been a child, calling my name again and again, and little Tom pulling at the skirts of my coat. I caught the youngster by the collar. “Polly Ann,” said I, “he’s grown to what I was when you picked me up, a foundling.” “And now it’s little Davy no more,” she answered, swept me a courtesy, and added, with a little quiver in her voice, “ye are a gentleman now.” “My heart is still where it was,” said I. “Ay, ay,” said Tom, “I’m sure o’ that, Davy.” I was with them a fortnight in the familiar cabin, and then I took up my journey northward, heavy at leaving again, but promising to see them from time to time.",

Louisville was even then bursting with importance, and as I rode into it, one bright November day, I remembered the wilderness I had seen here not ten years gone when I had marched hither with Captain Harrod’s company to join Clark on the island. It was even then a thriving little town of log and clapboard houses and schools and churches, and wise men were saying of it--what Colonel Clark had long ago predicted--that it would become the first city of commercial importance in the district of Kentucky. I do not mean to give you an account of my struggles that winter to obtain a foothold in the law. The time was a heyday for young barristers, and troubles in those early days grew as plentifully in Kentucky as corn. In short, I got a practice, for Colonel Clark was here to help me, and, thanks to the men who had gone to Kaskaskia and Vincennes, I had a fairly large acquaintance in Kentucky. I hired rooms behind Mr. Crede’s store, which was famed for the glass windows which had been fetched all the way from Philadelphia. Mr. Crede was the embodiment of the enterprising spirit of the place, and often of an evening he called me in to see the new fashionable things his barges had brought down the Ohio.

I put on my best blue clothes that I had brought with me from Richmond, and repaired expectantly to the tavern about eight of the clock, pushed through the curious crowd outside, and entered the big room where the company was fast assembling. Against the red blaze in the great chimney-place I spied the figure of Colonel Clark, more portly than of yore, and beside him stood a gentleman who could be no other than General Wilkinson. He was a man to fill the eye, handsome of face, symmetrical of figure, easy of manner, and he wore a suit of bottle-green that became him admirably. In short, so fascinated and absorbed was I in watching him as he greeted this man and the other that I started as though something had pricked me when I heard my name called by Colonel Clark. “Come here, Davy,” he cried across the room, and I came and stood abashed before the hero. “General, allow me to present to you the drummer boy of Kaskaskia and Vincennes, Mr. David Ritchie.” “I hear that you drummed them to victory through a very hell of torture, Mr. Ritchie,” said the General. “It is an honor to grasp the hand of one who did such service at such a tender age.” General Wilkinson availed himself of that honor, and encompassed me with a smile so benignant, so winning in its candor, that I could only mutter my acknowledgment, and Colonel Clark must needs apologize, laughing, for my youth and timidity.",

Toasts to this and that were flung back and forth, and jests and gibes, and the butt of many of these was that poor Federal government which (as one gentleman avowed) was like a bantam hen trying to cover a nestful of turkey’s eggs, and clucking with importance all the time. This picture brought on gusts of laughter. “And what say you of the Jay?” cried one; “what will he hatch?” Hisses greeted the name, for Mr. Jay wished to enter into a treaty with Spain, agreeing to close the river for five and twenty years.

The treatment he has had would bring a blush of shame to the cheek of any nation save a republic. Republics are wasteful, sir. In George Rogers Clark they have thrown away a general who might some day have decided the fate of this country, they have left to stagnate a man fit to lead a nation to war. And now he is ready to intrigue against the government with any adventurer who may have convincing ways and a smooth tongue.” “Mr. Wharton,” I said, rising, “did you come here to tell me this?” But Mr. Wharton continued to stare into the fire. “I like you the better for it, my dear sir,” said he, “and I assure you that I mean no offence.

They have tried in vain to open the Mississippi, and are too weak to do it. This man Wilkinson goes down to see Miro, and Miro straightway opens the river to us through him. How do you suppose Wilkinson did it? By his charming personality?” I said something, I know not what, as the light began to dawn on me. And then I added, “I had not thought about the General.” “Ah,” replied Mr. Wharton, “just so. And now you may easily imagine that General Wilkinson has come to a very pretty arrangement with Miro. For a certain stipulated sum best known to Wilkinson and Miro, General Wilkinson agrees gradually to detach Kentucky from the Union and join it to his Catholic Majesty’s dominion of Louisiana. The bribe--the opening of the river. What the government could not do Wilkinson did by the lifting of his finger.” Still Mr. Wharton spoke without heat. “Mind you,” he said, “we have no proof of this, and that is my reason for coming here to-night, Mr. Ritchie. I want you to get proof of it if you can.” “You want me--” I said, bewildered. “I repeat that you are not handsome,”--I think he emphasized this unduly,--“that you are self-effacing, inconspicuous; in short, you are not a man to draw suspicion.

CHAPTER VIII. TO ST. LOUIS By eleven o’clock the next morning I had wound up my affairs, having arranged with a young lawyer of my acquaintance to take over such cases as I had, and I was busy in my room packing my saddle-bags for the journey. The warm scents of spring were wafted through the open door and window, smells of the damp earth giving forth the green things, and tender shades greeted my eyes when I paused and raised my head to think. Purple buds littered the black ground before my door-step, and against the living green of the grass I saw the red stain of a robin’s breast as he hopped spasmodically hither and thither, now pausing immovable with his head raised, now tossing triumphantly a wriggling worm from the sod. Suddenly he flew away, and I heard a voice from the street side that brought me stark upright. “Hold there, neighbor; can you direct me to the mansion of that celebrated barrister, Mr. Ritchie?” There was no mistaking that voice--it was Nicholas Temple’s. I heard a laugh and an answer, the gate slammed, and Mr. Temple himself in a long gray riding-coat, booted and spurred, stood before me.",

They jogged into the town, I say, through the crowds of white trash, and rode up to the court-house where Sevier was being tried for his life. Evans stood at the open door and held the mare and gaped, while Cozby stalked in and shouldered his way to the front within four feet of the bar, like a big, awkward countryman. Jack Sevier saw him, and he saw Evans with the mare outside. Then, by thunder, Cozby takes a step right up to the bar and cries out, ‘Judge, aren’t you about done with that man?’ Faith, it was like judgment day, such a mix-up as there was after that, and Nollichucky Jack made three leaps",

A vague trouble had been working in my mind, but now the full horror of it dawned upon me. I was going to St. Louis. Mrs. Temple and Harry Riddle were gone there, so Polly Ann had avowed, and Nick could not help meeting Riddle. Sorely beset, I bent over to roll up a shirt, and refrained from answering. He came and laid a hand on my shoulder. “What the devil ails you, Davy?” he cried. “If it is an elopement, of course I won’t press you. I’m hanged if I’ll make a third.” “It is no elopement,” I retorted, my face growing hot in spite of myself. “Then I go with you,” said he, “for I vow you need taking care of. You can’t put me off, I say. But never in my life have I had such a reception, and from my own first cousin, too.” I was in a quandary, so totally unforeseen was this situation. And then a glimmer of hope came to me that perhaps his mother and Riddle might not be in St. Louis after all. I recalled the conversation in the cabin, and reflected that this wayward pair had stranded on so many beaches, had drifted off again on so many tides, that one place could scarce hold them long.

After dinner we rode down to the ferry, Nick on the thoroughbred which had beat Mr. Jackson’s horse, and his man, Benjy, on a scraggly pony behind. Benjy was a small, black negro with a very squat nose, alert and talkative save when Nick turned on him. Benjy had been born at Temple Bow; he worshipped his master and all that pertained to him, and he showered upon me all the respect and attention that was due to a member of the Temple family.",

I have no space to describe that trip overland, which reminded me at every stage of the march against Kaskaskia, the woods, the chocolate streams, the coffee-colored swamps flecked with dead leaves,--and at length the prairies, the grass not waist-high now, but young and tender, giving forth the acrid smell of spring. Nick was delighted. He made me recount every detail of my trials as a drummer boy, or kept me in continuous spells of laughter over his own escapades. In short, I began to realize that we were as near to each other as though we had never been parted. We looked down upon Kaskaskia from the self-same spot where I had stood on the bluff with Colonel Clark, and the sounds were even then the same,--the sweet tones of the church bell and the lowing of the cattle. We found a few Virginians and Pennsylvanians scattered in amongst the French, the forerunners of that change which was to come over this country. And we spent the night with my old friend, Father Gibault, still the faithful pastor of his flock; cheerful, though the savings of his lifetime had never been repaid by that country to which he had given his allegiance so freely. Travelling by easy stages, on the afternoon of the second day after leaving Kaskaskia we picked our way down the high bluff that rises above the American bottom, and saw below us that yellow monster among the rivers, the Mississippi.",

As for our horses, a keel boat must be sent after these, and Monsieur Gratiot would no doubt easily arrange for this.

And as I looked, the thought came again like a twinge of pain that Mrs. Temple and Riddle might be there, thinking themselves secure in this spot, so removed from the world and its doings. “How now, my man of mysterious affairs?” cried Nick, from the bottom of the boat; “you are as puckered as a sour persimmon. Have you a treaty with Spain in your pocket or a declaration of war?

A road slanted up the little limestone bluff, and above and below us stone houses could be seen nestling into the hill, houses higher on the river side, and with galleries there. We climbed the bluff, Benjy at our heels with the saddle-bags, and found ourselves on a yellow-clay street lined with grass and wild flowers. A great peace hung over the village, an air of a different race, a restfulness strange to a Kentuckian.

She is the widow of the founder of St. Louis, the Sieur Laclède, although she prefers her own name. She rules us with a strong hand, dispenses justice, settles disputes, and--sometimes indulges in them herself. It is her right.” “You will see a very pretty French custom of submission to parents,” said Madame Gratiot. “And afterwards there is a ball.” “A ball!” I exclaimed involuntarily. “It may seem very strange to you, Mr. Ritchie, but we believe that Sunday was made to enjoy. They will have time to attend the ball before you send them down the river?” she added mischievously, turning to her husband. “Certainly,” said he, “the loading will not be finished before eight o’clock.” Presently Madame Gratiot went off to Mass, while I walked with Monsieur Gratiot to a storehouse near the river’s bank, whence",

Afterwards I strolled about the silent village. Even the cabarets were deserted. A private of the Spanish Louisiana Regiment in a dirty uniform slouched behind the palings in front of the commandant’s quarters,--a quaint stone house set against the hill, with dormer windows in its curving roof, with a wide porch held by eight sturdy hewn pillars; here and there the muffled figure of a prowling Indian loitered, or a barefooted negress shuffled along by the fence crooning a folk-song. All the world had obeyed the call of the church bell save these--and Nick. I bethought myself of Nick, and made my way back to Monsieur Gratiot’s. I found my cousin railing at Benjy, who had extracted from the saddle-bags a wondrous gray suit of London cut in which to array his master. Clothes became Nick’s slim figure remarkably. This coat was cut away smartly, like a uniform, towards the tails, and was brought in at the waist with an infinite art. “Whither now, my conquistador?” I said.",

Followed by Benjy’s adoring eyes, he started out of the door, and I followed him perforce. We came to the little church, of upright logs and plaster, with its crudely shingled, peaked roof, with its tiny belfry crowned by a cross, with its porches on each side shading the line of windows there. Beside the church, a little at the back, was the curé’s modest house of stone, and at the other hand, under spreading trees, the graveyard with its rough wooden crosses. And behind these graves rose the wooded hill that stretched away towards the wilderness. What a span of life had been theirs who rested here! Their youth, perchance, had been spent amongst the crooked streets of some French village, streets lined by red-tiled houses and crossing limpid streams by quaint bridges. Death had overtaken them beside a monster tawny river of which their imaginations had not conceived, a river which draws tribute from the remote places of an unknown land,--a river, indeed, which, mixing all the waters, seemed to symbolize a coming race which was to conquer the land by its resistless flow, even as the Mississippi bore relentlessly towards the sea. These were my own thoughts as I listened to the tones of the priest as they came, droningly, out of the door, while Nick was exchanging jokes in doubtful French with some half-breeds leaning against the palings.",

Those who reached the steps gave back, respectfully, and there came an elderly lady in a sober turban, a black mantilla wrapped tightly about her shoulders, and I made no doubt that she was Monsieur Gratiot’s mother-in-law, Madame Chouteau, she whom he had jestingly called the queen regent. I was sure of this when I saw Madame Gratiot behind her. Madame Chouteau indeed had the face of authority, a high-bridged nose, a determined chin, a mouth that shut tightly. Madame Gratiot presented us to her mother, and as she passed on to the gate Madame Chouteau reminded us that we were to dine with her at two. After her the congregation, the well-to-do and the poor alike, poured out of the church and spread in merry groups over the grass: keel boatmen in tow shirts and party-colored worsted belts, the blacksmith, the shoemaker, the farmer of a small plot in the common fields in large cotton pantaloons and light-wove camlet coat, the more favored in skull-caps, linen small-clothes, cotton stockings, and silver-buckled shoes,--every man pausing, dipping into his tabatière, for a word with his neighbor. The women, too, made a picture strange to our eyes, the matrons in jacket and petticoat, a Madras handkerchief flung about their shoulders, the girls in fresh cottonade or calamanco.

Behind ‘Polyte came two rotund little men perspiring freely, and laden down with various articles,--a bird-cage with two yellow birds, a hat-trunk, an inlaid card box, a roll of scarlet cloth, and I know not what else. They deposited these on the grass beside the barrel, which ‘Polyte had set on end and proceeded to mount, encouraged by the shouts of his friends, who pressed around the barrel. “It’s an auction,” I said. But Nick did not hear me. I followed his glance to the far side of the circle, and my eye was caught by a red ribbon, a blush that matched it. A glance shot from underneath long lashes,--but not for me. Beside the girl, and palpably uneasy, stood the young man who had been called Gaspard. “Ah,” said I, “your angel of the tumbrel.” But Nick had pulled off his hat and was sweeping her a bow. The girl looked down, smoothing her ribbon, Gaspard took a step forward, and other young women near us tittered with delight. The voice of Hippolyte rolling his r’s called out in a French dialect:-- “M’ssieurs et Mesdames, ce sont des effets d’un pauvre officier qui est mort. Who will buy?” He opened the hat-trunk, produced an antiquated beaver with a gold cord, and surveyed it with a covetousness that was admirably feigned. For ‘Polyte was an actor.",

And with the trunk, too. Ah, mon Dieu, can you afford to miss it?” The crowd howled, Suzanne simpered, and Gaspard turned as pink as clover. But he was not to be bullied. The hat was sold to an elderly person, the red cloth likewise; a pot of grease went to a housewife, and there was a veritable scramble for the box of playing cards; and at last Hippolyte held up the wooden cage with the fluttering yellow birds. “Ha!” he cried, his eyes on Gaspard once more, “a gentle present--a present to make a heart relent. And Monsieur Léon, perchance you will make a bid, although they are not gamecocks.” Instantly, from somewhere under the barrel, a cock crew. Even the yellow birds looked surprised, and as for ‘Polyte, he nearly dropped the cage. One elderly person crossed himself. I looked at Nick. His face was impassive, but suddenly I remembered his boyhood gift, how he had imitated the monkeys, and I began to shake with inward laughter. There was an uncomfortable silence. “Peste, c’est la magie!” said an old man at last, searching with an uncertain hand for his snuff. “Monsieur,” cried Nick to the auctioneer, “I will make a bid.",

Une bagatelle! Onze, Gaspard! Onze! onze livres, pour l’amour de Suzanne!” But Gaspard was silent. No appeals, entreaties, or taunts could persuade him to bid more. And at length Hippolyte, with a gesture of disdain, handed Nick the cage, as though he were giving it away. “Monsieur,” he said, “the birds are yours, since there are no more lovers who are worthy of the name. They do not exist.” “Monsieur,” answered Nick, “it is to disprove that statement that I have bought the birds. Mademoiselle,” he added, turning to the flushing Suzanne, “I pray that you will accept this present with every assurance of my humble regard.” Mademoiselle took the cage, and amidst the laughter of the village at the discomfiture of poor Gaspard, swept Nick a frightened courtesy,--one that nevertheless was full of coquetry. And at that instant, to cap the situation, a rotund little man with a round face under a linen biretta grasped Nick by the hand, and cried in painful but sincere English:-- “Monsieur, you mek my daughter ver’ happy.

The sun was hanging low over the western hills as we approached the barracks, and out of the open windows came the merry, mad sounds of violin, guitar, and flageolet, the tinkle of a triangle now and then, the shouts of laughter, the shuffle of many feet over the puncheons. Within the door, smiling and benignant, unmindful of the stifling atmosphere, sat the black-robed village priest talking volubly to an elderly man in a scarlet cap, and several stout ladies ranged along the wall: beyond them, on a platform, Zéron, the baker, fiddled as though his life depended on it, the perspiration dripping from his brow, frowning, gesticulating at them with the flageolet and the triangle. And in a dim, noisy, heated whirl the whole village went round and round and round under the low ceiling in the valse, young and old, rich and poor, high and low, the sound of their laughter and the scraping of their feet cut now and again by an agonized squeak from Zéron’s fiddle. From time to time a staggering, panting couple would fling themselves out, help themselves liberally to pink sirop from the bowl on the side table, and then fling themselves in once more, until Zéron stopped from sheer exhaustion, to tune up for a pas de deux. Across the room, by the sirop bowl, a pair of red ribbons flaunted, a pair of eyes sent a swift challenge, Zéron and his assistants struck up again, and there in a corner was Nick Temple, with characteristic effrontery attempting a pas de deux with Suzanne.",

For a while the tune held its mad pace, and ended with a shriek and a snap on a high note, for Zéron had broken a string. Amid a burst of laughter from the far end of the room I saw Nick stop before an open window in which a prying Indian was framed, swing Suzanne at arm’s length, and bow abruptly at the brave with a grunt that startled him into life. “Va-t’en, méchant!” shrieked Suzanne, excitedly. Poor Gaspard! Poor Hippolyte! They would gain Suzanne for a dance only to have her snatched away at the next by the slim and reckless young gentleman in the gray court clothes. Little Nick cared that the affair soon became the amusement of the company. From time to time, as he glided past with Suzanne on his shoulder, he nodded gayly to Colonel Chouteau or made a long face at me, and to save our souls we could not help laughing. “The girl has met her match, for she has played shuttle-cock with all the hearts in the village,” said Monsieur Chouteau. “But perhaps it is just as well that Mr. Temple is leaving to-night.

She was like Suzanne.” “How long ago did you come from France, Monsieur?” I asked, to get away from an uncomfortable subject. “It is twenty years,” said he, dreamily, in French. “I was born in the Quartier Saint Jean, on the harbor of the city of Marseilles near Notre Dame de la Nativité.” And he told of a tall, uneven house of four stories, with a high pitched roof, and a little barred door and window at the bottom giving out upon the rough cobbles. He spoke of the smell of the sea, of the rollicking sailors who surged through the narrow street to embark on his Majesty’s men-of-war, and of the King’s white soldiers in ranks of four going to foreign lands.",

Below the mill, so Monsieur Gratiot told me, where the creek lay in pools on its limestone bed, the village washing was done; and every Monday morning bare-legged negresses strode up this road, the bundles of clothes balanced on their heads, the paddles in their hands, followed by a stream of black urchins who tempted Providence to drown them.

It was not until we reached the road and had begun to climb out of the valley that the silence was broken between us. “Monsieur,” said Colonel Chouteau, slyly, “do you have many such escapes?” “It might have been closer,” said Nick. “Closer?” ejaculated the Colonel. “Assuredly,” said Nick, “to the extent of abducting Monsieur le curé. As for you, Davy,” he added, between his teeth, “I mean to get even with you.” It was well for us that the Colonel and Monsieur Gratiot took the escapade with such good nature. And so we walked along through the summer night, talking gayly, until at length the lights of the village twinkled ahead of us, and in the streets we met many parties making merry on their homeward way.",

Her captain, a picturesque Canadian by the name of Xavier Paret, was presented to us; we bade our friends farewell, and stepped across the plank to the deck. As we were casting off, Monsieur Gratiot called to us that he would take the first occasion to send our horses back to Kentucky. The oars were manned, the heavy hulk moved, and we were shot out into the mighty current of the river on our way to New Orleans. Nick and I stood for a long time on the deck, and the windows of the little village gleamed like stars among the trees. We passed the last of its houses that nestled against the hill, and below that the forest lay like velvet under the moon. The song of our boatmen broke the silence of the night:-- “Voici le temps et la saison, Voici le temps et la saison, Ah! vrai, que les journées sont longues, Ah! vrai, que les journées sont longues!”",

To us it had an Old World, almost Oriental flavor of mystery and luxury and pleasure, and we imagined it swathed in the moisture of the Delta, built of quaint houses, with courts of shining orange trees and magnolias, and surrounded by flowering plantations of unimagined beauty. It was most fitting that such a place should be the seat of dark intrigues against material progress, and this notion lent added zest to my errand thither. As for Nick, it took no great sagacity on my part to predict that he would forget Suzanne and begin to look forward to the Creole beauties of the Mysterious City. First, there was the fur-laden keel boat in which we travelled, gone forever now from Western navigation. It had its rude square sail to take advantage of the river winds, its mast strongly braced to hold the long tow-ropes. But tow-ropes were for the endless up-river journey, when a numerous crew strained day after day along the bank, chanting the voyageurs’ songs. Now we were light-manned, two half-breeds and two Canadians to handle the oars in time of peril, and Captain Xavier, who stood aft on the cabin roof, leaning against the heavy beam of the long, curved tiller, watching hawklike for snag and eddy and bar.",

But in these fair nights we chose to sleep on deck. Far into the night we sat, Nick and I, our feet dangling over the forward edge of the cabin, looking at the glory of the moon on the vast river, at the endless forest crown, at the haze which hung like silver dust under the high bluffs on the American side. We slept. We awoke again as the moon was shrinking abashed before the light that glowed above these cliffs, and the river was turned from brown to gold and then to burnished copper, the forest to a thousand shades of green from crest to the banks where the river was licking the twisted roots to nakedness. The south wind wafted the sharp wood-smoke from the chimney across our faces. In the stern Xavier stood immovable against the tiller, his short pipe clutched between his teeth, the colors of his new worsted belt made gorgeous by the rising sun. “B’jour, Michié,” he said, and added in the English he had picked up from the British traders, “the breakfas’ he is ready, and Jean make him good. Will you have the grace to descen’?” We went down the ladder into the cabin, where the odor of the furs mingled with the smell of the cooking. There was a fricassee steaming on the crane, some of Zéron’s bread, brought from St. Louis, and coffee that Monsieur Gratiot had provided for our use. We took our bowls and cups on deck and sat on the edge of the cabin. “By gad,” cried Nick, “it lacks but the one element to make it a paradise.” “And what is that?” I demanded.",

There came to my mind the memory of that hurricane at Temple Bow long ago, a storm that seemed to have brought so much sorrow into my life. I glanced at Nick, but his face was serene. The cloud-bank came on in black and yellow masses, and the saffron light I recalled so well turned the living green of the forest to a sickly pallor and the yellow river to a tinge scarce to be matched on earth. Xavier had the tiller now, and the men were straining at the oars to send the boat across the current towards the nearer western shore. And as my glance took in the scale of things, the miles of bluff frowning above the bottom, the river that seemed now like a lake of lava gently boiling, and the wilderness of the western shore that reached beyond the ken of man, I could not but shudder to think of the conflict of nature’s forces in such a place. A grim stillness reigned over all, broken only now and again by a sharp command from Xavier. The men were rowing for their lives, the sweat glistening on their red faces. “She come,” said Xavier.",

The terrified scream of a panther broke the silence of the forest, and then the other distant note grew stronger, and stronger yet, and rose to a high hum like unto no sound on this earth, and mingled with it now was a lashing like water falling from a great height. We grounded, and Xavier, seizing a great tow-rope, leaped into the shallow water and passed the bight around a trunk. I cried out to Nick, but my voice was drowned. He seized me and flung me under the cabin’s lee, and then above the fearful note of the storm came cracklings like gunshots of great trees snapping at their trunk. We saw the forest wall burst out--how far away I know not--and the air was filled as with a flock of giant birds, and boughs crashed on the roof of the cabin and tore the water in the darkness. How long we lay clutching each other in terror on the rocking boat I may not say, but when the veil first lifted there was the river like an angry sea, and limitless, the wind in its fury whipping the foam from the crests and bearing it off into space.

Then we heard Xavier’s voice, in French, thanking the Blessed Virgin for our escape. Further speech was gone from us, for men do not talk after such a matter. We laid hold of the tree across the cabin and, straining, flung it over into the water. A great drop of rain hit me on the forehead, and there came a silver-gray downpour that blotted out the scene and drove us down below. And then, from somewhere in the depths of the dark cabin, came a sound to make a man’s blood run cold. “What’s that?” I said, clutching Nick. “Benjy,” said he; “thank God he did not die of fright.” We lighted a candle, and poking around, found the negro where he had crept into the farthest corner of a bunk with his face to the wall. And when we touched him he gave vent to a yell that was blood-curdling. “I’se a bad nigger, Lo’d, yes, I is,” he moaned. “I ain’t fit fo’ jedgment, Lo’d.” Nick shook him and laughed. “Come out of that, Benjy,” he said; “you’ve got another chance.” Benjy turned, perforce, the whites of his eyes gleaming in the candle-light, and stared at us. “You ain’t gone yit, Marse,” he said. “Gone where?” said Nick.",

Climbing to the deck, we found that the boat was already under way, running southward in the current through the misty rain. And gazing shoreward, a sight met my eyes which I shall never forget. A wide vista, carpeted with wreckage, was cut through the forest to the river’s edge, and the yellow water was strewn for miles with green boughs. We stared down it, overwhelmed, until we had passed beyond its line. “It is as straight,” said Nick, “as straight as one of her Majesty’s alleys I saw cut through the forest at Saint-Cloud.” Had I space and time to give a faithful account of this journey it would be chiefly a tribute to Xavier’s skill, for they who have not put themselves at the mercy of the Mississippi in a small craft can have no idea of the dangers of such a voyage. Infinite experience, a keen eye, a steady hand, and a nerve of iron are required. Now, when the current swirled almost to a rapid, we grazed a rock by the width of a ripple; and again, despite the effort of Xavier and the crew, we would tear the limbs from a huge tree, which, had we hit it fair, would have ripped us from bow to stern. Once, indeed, we were fast on a sand-bar, whence (as Nick said) Xavier fairly cursed us off. We took care to moor at night, where we could be seen as little as possible from the river, and divided the watches lest we should be surprised by Indians.",

At times we fished, and one evening, after we had passed the expanse of water at the mouth of the Ohio, Nick pulled a hideous thing from the inscrutable yellow depths,--a slimy, scaleless catfish. He came up like a log, and must have weighed seventy pounds. Xavier and his men and myself made two good meals of him, but Nick would not touch the meat. The great river teemed with life. There were flocks of herons and cranes and water pelicans, and I know not what other birds, and as we slipped under the banks we often heard the paroquets chattering in the forests. And once, as we drifted into an inlet at sunset, we caught sight of the shaggy head of a bear above the brown water, and leaping down into the cabin I primed the rifle that stood there and shot him. It took the seven of us to drag him on board, and then I cleaned and skinned him as Tom had taught me, and showed Jean how to put the caul fat and liver in rows on a skewer and wrap it in the bear’s handkerchief and roast it before the fire. Nick found no difficulty in eating this--it was a dish fit for any gourmand.

The prospect was sufficiently disquieting on that murky day. Below us, on the one hand, a rocky bluff reached out into the river, and on the far side was a timber-clad point round which the Mississippi doubled and flowed back on itself. It needed no trained eye to guess at the perils of the place. On the one side the mighty current charged against the bluff and, furious at the obstacle, lashed itself into a hundred sucks and whirls, their course marked by the flotsam plundered from the forests above. Woe betide the boat that got into this devil’s caldron! And on the other side, near the timbered point, ran a counter current marked by forest wreckage flowing up-stream. To venture too far on this side was to be grounded or at least to be sent back to embark once more on the trial. But where was the channel? We watched Xavier with bated breath. Not once did he take his eyes from the swirling water ahead, but gave the tiller a touch from time to time, now right, now left, and called in a monotone for the port or starboard oars.

Here we stopped for a day and a night that Xavier and his crew might get properly drunk on tafia, while Nick and I walked about the town and waited until his Excellency, the commandant, had finished dinner that we might present our letters and obtain his passport. Natchez at that date was a sufficiently unkempt and evil place of dirty, ramshackle houses and gambling dens, where men of the four nations gamed and quarrelled and fought.

Here in truth was a new world, a land of peaceful customs, green and moist. The soft-toned bells of it seemed an expression of its life,--so far removed from our own striving and fighting existence in Kentucky.

Xavier, however, was not to be caught thus, and presently we were gliding quietly along the eastern bank, or levee, which held back the river from the lowlands. Then, as we looked, the levee became an esplanade shaded by rows of willows, and through them we caught sight of the upper galleries and low, curving roofs of the city itself. There, cried Xavier, was the Governor’s house on the corner, where the great Miro lived, and beyond it the house of the Intendant; and then, gliding into an open space between the keel boats along the bank, stared at by a score of boatmen and idlers from above, we came to the end of our long journey. No sooner had we made fast than we were boarded by a shabby customs officer who, when he had seen our passports, bowed politely and invited us to land. We leaped ashore, gained the gravelled walk on the levee, and looked about us. Squalidity first met our eyes.

The narrow, muddy streets ran with filth, and on each side along the houses was a sun-baked walk held up by the curved sides of broken flatboats, where two men might scarcely pass. The houses, too, had an odd and foreign look, some of wood, some of upright logs and plaster, and newer ones, Spanish in style, of adobe, with curving roofs of red tiles and strong eaves spreading over the banquette (as the sidewalk was called), casting shadows on lemon-colored walls. Since New Orleans was in a swamp, the older houses for the most part were lifted some seven feet above the ground, and many of these houses had wide galleries on the street side.",

Again, at an open wicket, we caught a glimpse through a cool archway into a flowering court-yard. Stalwart negresses with bright kerchiefs made way for us on the banquette. Hands on hips, they swung along erect, with baskets of cakes and sweetmeats on their heads, musically crying their wares. At length, turning a corner, we came to a white wooden house on the Rue Royale, with a flight of steps leading up to the entrance. In place of a door a flimsy curtain hung in the doorway, and, pushing this aside, we followed Xavier through a darkened hall to a wide gallery that overlooked a court-yard. This court-yard was shaded by several great trees which grew there; the house and gallery ran down one other side of it; and the two remaining sides were made up of a series of low cabins, these forming the various outhouses and the kitchen. At the far end of this gallery a sallow, buxom lady sat sewing at a table, and Xavier saluted her very respectfully. “Madame,” he said, “I have brought you from St. Louis with Michié Gratiot’s compliments two young American gentlemen, who are travelling to amuse themselves.” The lady rose and beamed upon us. “From Monsieur Gratiot,” she said; “you are very welcome, gentlemen, to such poor accommodations as I have.",

Zoey!” There was a shrill answer from the court below, and a negro girl in a yellow turban came running up, while Madame Bouvet bustled along the gallery and opened the doors of two darkened rooms. Within I could dimly see a walnut dresser, a chair, and a walnut bed on which was spread a mosquito bar. “Voilá! Messieurs,” cried Madame Bouvet, “there is still a little time for a siesta. No siesta!” cried Madame, eying us aghast; “ah, the Americans they never rest--never.” We bade farewell to the good Xavier, promising to see him soon; and Nick, shouting to Benjy to open the saddle-bags, proceeded to array himself in the clothes which had made so much havoc at St. Louis. I boded no good from this proceeding, but I reflected, as I watched him dress, that I might as well try to turn the Mississippi from its course as to attempt to keep my cousin from the search for gallant adventure. And I reflected that his indulgence in pleasure-seeking would serve the more to divert any suspicions which might fall upon my own head. At last, when the setting sun was flooding the court-yard, he stood arrayed upon the gallery, ready to venture forth to conquest. Madame Bouvet’s tavern, or hotel, or whatever she was pleased to call it, was not immaculately clean.",

   "text": "Before passing into the street we stood for a moment looking into the public room on the left of the hallway, a long saloon, evidently used in the early afternoon for a dining room, and at the back of it a wide, many-paned window, capped by a Spanish arch, looked out on the gallery. Near this window was a gay party of young men engaged at cards, waited on by the yellow-turbaned Zoey, and drinking what evidently was claret punch. The sounds of their jests and laughter pursued us out of the house. The town was waking from its siesta, the streets filling, and people stopped to stare at Nick as we passed. But Nick, who was plainly in search of something he did not find, hurried on. We soon came to the quarter which had suffered most from the fire, where new houses had gone up or were in the building beside the blackened logs of many of Bienville’s time. Then we came to a high white wall that surrounded a large garden, and within it was a long, massive building of some beauty and pretension, with a high, latticed belfry and heavy walls and with arched dormers in the sloping roof. As we stood staring at it through the iron grille set in the archway of the lodge, Nick declared that it put him in mind of some of the châteaux he had seen in France, and he crossed the street to get a better view of the premises. An old man in coarse blue linen came out of the lodge and spoke to me. “It is the convent of the good nuns, the Ursulines, Monsieur,” he said in French, “and it was built long ago in the Sieur de Bienville’s time, when the colony was young.",

The good man gasped, lifted his hands in horror, and straightway let loose upon Nick a torrent of French invectives that had not the least effect except to cause a blacksmith’s apprentice and two negroes to stop and stare at us. “Pooh!” exclaimed Nick, when the man had paused for want of breath, “it is no trick to get over that wall.” “Bon Dieu!” cried the porter, “you are Kentuckians, yes? I might have known that you were Kentuckians, and I shall advise the good sisters to put glass on the wall and keep a watch.” “The young ladies are beautiful, you say?” said Nick. At this juncture, with the negroes grinning and the porter near bursting with rage, there came out of the lodge the fattest woman I have ever seen for her size. She seized her husband by the back of his loose frock and pulled him away, crying out that he was losing time by talking to vagabonds, besides disturbing the good sisters.",

Turning southward under the bank past the huddle of market-stalls, we came suddenly upon a sight that made us pause and wonder. New Orleans was awake. A gay and laughing throng paced the esplanade on the levee under the willows, with here and there a cavalier on horseback on the Royal Road below. Across the Place d’Armes the spire of the parish church stood against the fading sky, and to the westward the mighty river stretched away like a gilded floor. It was a strange throng. There were grave Spaniards in long cloaks and feathered beavers; jolly merchants and artisans in short linen jackets, each with his tabatière, the wives with bits of finery, the children laughing and shouting and dodging in and out between fathers and mothers beaming with quiet pride and contentment; swarthy boat-men with their worsted belts, gaudy negresses chanting in the soft patois, and here and there a blanketed Indian. Nor was this all. Some occasion (so Madame Bouvet had told us) had brought a sprinkling of fashion to town that day, and it was a fashion to astonish me. There were fine gentlemen with swords and silk waistcoats and silver shoe-buckles, and ladies in filmy summer gowns. Greuze ruled the mode in France then, but New Orleans had not got beyond Watteau. As for Nick and me, we knew nothing of Greuze and Watteau then, and we could only stare in astonishment.",

Every flatboatman who returned to Kentucky was full of tales of the marvellous beauty of the quadroons and octoroons, stories which I had taken with a grain of salt; but they had not indeed been greatly overdrawn. For here were these ladies in the flesh, their great, opaque, almond eyes consuming us with a swift glance, and each walking with a languid grace beside her duenna. Their faces were like old ivory, their dress the stern Miro himself could scarce repress. In former times they had been lavish in their finery, and even now earrings still gleamed and color broke out irrepressibly. Nick was delighted, but he had not dragged me twice the length of the esplanade ere his eye was caught by a young lady in pink who sauntered between an elderly gentleman in black silk and a young man more gayly dressed. “Egad,” said Nick, “there is my divinity, and I need not look a step farther.”",

Thank heaven these short sleeves are the fashion.” “You are mad, Nick,” I answered, pulling him on, “these people are not to be stared at so. And once I present our letters to Monsieur de Saint-Gré, it will not be difficult to know any of them.” “Look!” said he, “that young man, lover or husband, is a brute. On my soul, they are quarrelling.” The three had stopped by a bench under a tree. The young man, who wore claret silk and a sword, had one of those thin faces of dirty complexion which show the ravages of dissipation, and he was talking with a rapidity and vehemence of which only a Latin tongue will admit. We could see, likewise, that the girl was answering with spirit,--indeed, I should write a stronger word than spirit,--while the elderly gentleman, who had a good-humored, fleshy face and figure, was plainly doing his best to calm them both. People who were passing stared curiously at the three. “Your divinity evidently has a temper,” I remarked. “For that scoundel--certainly,” said Nick; “but come, they are moving on.” “You mean to follow them?” I exclaimed. “Why not?” said he. “We will find out where they live and who they are, at least.” “And you have taken a fancy to this girl?” “I have looked them all over, and she’s by far the best I’ve seen.",

Twilight had set in strongly, the gay crowd was beginning to disperse, and in the distance the three figures could be seen making their way across the Place d’Armes, the girl hanging on the elderly gentleman’s arm, and the young man following with seeming sullenness behind. They turned into one of the narrower streets, and we quickened our steps. Lights gleamed in the houses; voices and laughter, and once the tinkle of a guitar came to us from court-yard and gallery. But Nick, hurrying on, came near to bowling more than one respectable citizen we met on the banquette, into the ditch. We reached a corner, and the three were nowhere to be seen. “Curse the luck!” cried Nick, “we have lost them. The next time I’ll stop for no explanations.” There was no particular reason why I should have been penitent, but I ventured to say that the house they had entered could not be far off. “And how the devil are we to know it?” demanded Nick. This puzzled me for a moment, but presently I began to think that the two might begin quarrelling again, and said so. Nick laughed and put his arm around my neck. “You have no mean ability for intrigue when you put your mind to it, Davy,” he said; “I vow I believe you are in love with the girl yourself.” I disclaimed this with some vehemence.",

It was set back a little from the street, and there was a high adobe wall into which a pair of gates were set, and a wicket opening in one of them. Over the wall hung a dark fringe of magnolia and orange boughs. On each of the gate-posts a crouching lion was outlined dimly against the fainting light, and, by crossing the street, we could see the upper line of a latticed gallery under the low roof. We took our stand within the empty doorway of a blackened house, nearly opposite, and there we waited, Nick murmuring all sorts of ridiculous things in my ear. But presently I began to reflect upon the consequences of being taken in such a situation by a constable and dragged into the light of a public examination. I put this to Nick as plainly as I could, and was declaring my intention of going back to Madame Bouvet’s, when the sound of voices arrested me. The voices came from the latticed gallery, and they were low at first, but soon rose to such an angry pitch that I made no doubt we had hit on the right house after all. What they said was lost to us, but I could distinguish the woman’s voice, low-pitched and vibrant as though insisting upon a refusal, and the man’s scarce adult tones, now high as though with balked passion, now shaken and imploring.",

Then came the light relief of a woman’s gown in the opening of the lattice, the cry “Auguste, Auguste!” the wicket in the gate opened and slammed, and a man ran at top speed along the banquette towards the levee.

When I had gained the step again he was gone after the man, and a portly citizen stood in front of me, looking into the doorway. “Qu’est-ce-qu’il-y-a la dedans?” he demanded sharply. It was a sufficiently embarrassing situation. I put on a bold front, however, and not deigning to answer, pushed past him and walked with as much leisure as possible along the banquette in the direction which Nick had taken. As I turned the corner I glanced over my shoulder, and in the darkness I could just make out the man standing where I had left him. In great uneasiness I pursued my way, my imagination summing up for Nick all kinds of adventures with disagreeable consequences. I walked for some time--it may have been half an hour--aimlessly, and finally decided it would be best to go back to Madame Bouvet’s and await the issue with as much calmness as possible. He might not, after all, have caught the fellow. There were few people in the dark streets, but at length I met a man who gave me directions, and presently found my way back to my lodging place. Talk and laughter floated through the latticed windows into the street, and when I had pushed back the curtain and looked into the saloon I found the same gaming party at the end of it, sitting in their shirt-sleeves amidst the moths and insects that hovered around the candles.",

And yet I smile as I write this, realizing full well that my strange and foreign surroundings and my unforeseen adventure had much to do with my state of mind. The lady in the miniature might have been eighteen, or thirty-five. Her features were of the clearest cut, the nose the least trifle aquiline, and by a blurred outline the painter had given to the black hair piled high upon the head a suggestion of waviness. The eyebrows were straight, the brown eyes looked at the world with an almost scornful sense of humor, and I marked that there was determination in the chin. Here was a face that could be infinitely haughty or infinitely tender, a mouth of witty--nay, perhaps cutting--repartee of brevity and force.",

Egad,” he added with a laugh, “there would be no more walking the streets at night in search of adventure for you. Consider carefully the masterful features of that lady and thank God you haven’t got her.” I was inclined to be angry, but ended by laughing. “There will be no rivalry between us, at least,” I said. “Rivalry!” exclaimed Nick. “Heaven forbid that I should aspire to such abject slavery. When I marry, it will be to command.” “All the more honor in such a conquest,” I suggested. “Davy,” said he, “I have long been looking for some such flaw in your insuperable wisdom. But I vow I can keep my eyes open no longer. Benjy!” A smothered response came from the other side of the wall, and Benjy duly appeared in the doorway, blinking at the candlelight, to put his master to bed. We slept that night with no bed covering save the mosquito bar, as was the custom in New Orleans. Indeed, the heat was most oppressive, but we had become to some extent inured to it on the boat, and we were both in such sound health that our slumbers were not disturbed. Early in the morning, however, I was awakened by a negro song from the court-yard, and I lay pleasantly for some minutes listening to the early sounds, breathing in the aroma of coffee which mingled with the odor of the flowers of the court, until Zoey herself appeared in the doorway, holding a cup in her hand.",

This done, I went out into the gallery, where Madame was already seated at her knitting, in the shade of the great tree that stood in the corner of the court and spread its branches over the eaves. She arose and courtesied, with a questioning smile. “Madame,” I asked, “is it too early to present myself to Monsieur de Saint-Gré?” “Pardieu, no, Monsieur, we are early risers in the South for we have our siesta. You are going to return the portrait, Monsieur?”",

She looked at me timidly, appealingly, but I bowed and departed. The sun was riding up into the sky, the walls already glowing with his heat, and a midsummer languor seemed to pervade the streets as I walked along. The shadows now were sharply defined, the checkered foliage of the trees was flung in black against the yellow-white wall of the house with the lions, and the green-latticed gallery which we had watched the night before seemed silent and deserted. I knocked at the gate, and presently a bright-turbaned gardienne opened it. Was Monsieur de Saint-Gré at home. The gardienne looked me over, and evidently finding me respectable, replied with many protestations of sorrow that he was not, that he had gone with Mamselle very early that morning to his country place at Les Îles. This information I extracted with difficulty, for I was not by any means versed in the negro patois. As I walked back to Madame Bouvet’s I made up my mind that there was but the one thing to do, to go at once to Monsieur de Saint-Gré’s plantation. Finding Madame still waiting in the gallery, I asked her to direct me thither. “You have but to follow the road that runs southward along the levee, and some three leagues will bring you to it, Monsieur.",

Certainly, Monsieur. He will no doubt give you better advice than I on this matter.” I found Mr. Clark in his counting-room, and I had not talked with him five minutes before I began to suspect that, if a treasonable understanding existed between Wilkinson and the Spanish government, Mr. Clark was innocent of it. He being the only prominent American in the place, it was natural that Wilkinson should have formed with him a business arrangement to care for the cargoes he sent down. Indeed, after we had sat for some time chatting together, Mr. Clark began himself to make guarded inquiries on this very subject. Did I know Wilkinson? How was his enterprise of selling Kentucky products regarded at home? But I do not intend to burden this story with accounts of a matter which, though it has never been wholly clear, has been long since fairly settled in the public mind. Mr. Clark was most amiable, accepted my statement that I was travelling for pleasure, and honored Monsieur Chouteau’s bon (for my purchase of the miniature had deprived me of nearly all my ready money), and said that Mr. Temple and I would need horses to get to Les Îles. “And unless you purpose going back to Kentucky by keel boat, or round by sea to Philadelphia or New York, and cross the mountains,” he said, “you will need good horses for your journey through Natchez and the Cumberland country.",

I shall not presume to advise a Kentuckian on such a purchase.” The horses were crowded together under a dirty shed near the levee, and the vessel from which they had been landed rode at anchor in the river. They were the scrawny, tough ponies of the plains, reasonably cheap, and it took no great discernment on my part to choose three of the strongest and most intelligent looking. We went next to a saddler’s, where I selected three saddles and bridles of Spanish workmanship, and Mr. Clark agreed to have two of his servants meet us with the horses before Madame Bouvet’s within the hour. He begged that we would dine with him when we returned from Les Îles. “You will not find an island, Mr. Ritchie,” he said; “Saint-Gré’s plantation is a huge block of land between the river and a cypress swamp behind. Saint-Gré is a man with a wonderful quality of mind, who might, like his ancestors, have made his mark if necessity had probed him or opportunity offered. He never forgave the Spanish government for the murder of his father, nor do I blame him. He has his troubles. His son is an incurable rake and degenerate, as you may have heard.” I went back to Madame Bouvet’s, to find Nick emerging from his toilet. “What deviltry have you been up to, Davy?” he demanded.",

The man you chased with such futility was her brother, and he stole from her the miniature of which I am now the fortunate possessor.” He stared at me for a moment in rueful amazement. “And her name?” he demanded. “Antoinette de Saint-Gré,” I answered; “our letter is to her father.” He made me a rueful bow. “I fear that I have undervalued you, Mr. Ritchie,” he said. “You have no peer. I am unworthy to accompany you, and furthermore, it would be useless.” “And why useless!” I inquired, laughing. “You have doubtless seen the lady, and she is yours,\" said he. “You forget that I am in love with a miniature,” I said. In half an hour we were packed and ready, the horses had arrived, we bade good-by to Madame Bouvet and rode down the miry street until we reached the road behind the levee. Turning southward, we soon left behind the shaded esplanade and the city’s roofs below us, and came to the first of the plantation houses set back amidst the dark foliage.",

The sun’s rays pierced it and gathered fire; the mighty river beside us rolled listless and sullen, flinging back the heat defiantly. And on our left was a tropical forest in all its bewildering luxuriance, the live-oak, the hackberry, the myrtle, the Spanish bayonet in bristling groups, and the shaded places gave out a scented moisture like an orangery; anon we passed fields of corn and cotton, swamps of rice, stretches of poverty-stricken indigo plants, gnawed to the stem by the pest. Our ponies ambled on, unmindful; but Nick vowed that no woman under heaven would induce him to undertake such a journey again. Some three miles out of the city we descried two figures on horseback coming towards us, and quickly perceived that one was a gentleman, the other his black servant. They were riding at a more rapid pace than the day warranted, but the gentleman reined in his sweating horse as he drew near to us, eyed us with a curiosity tempered by courtesy, bowed gravely, and put his horse to a canter again. “Phew!” said Nick, twisting in his saddle, “I thought that all Creoles were lazy.” “We have met the exception, perhaps,” I answered. “Did you take in that man?” “His looks were a little remarkable, come to think of it,” answered Nick, settling down into his saddle again.",

We pursued our way slowly, from time to time catching a glimpse of a dwelling almost hid in the distant foliage, until at length we came to a place a little more pretentious than those which we had seen. From the road a graceful flight of wooden steps climbed the levee and descended on the far side to a boat landing, and a straight vista cut through the grove, lined by wild orange trees, disclosed the white pillars and galleries of a far-away plantation house. The grassy path leading through the vista was trimly kept, and on either side of it in the moist, green shade of the great trees flowers bloomed in a profusion of startling colors,--in splotches of scarlet and white and royal purple. Nick slipped from his horse. “Behold the mansion of Mademoiselle de Saint-Gré,” said he, waving his hand up the vista. “How do you know?” I asked. “I am told by a part of me that never lies, Davy,” he answered, laying his hand upon his heart; “and besides,” he added, “I should dislike devilishly to go too far on such a day and have to come back again.” “We will rest here,” I said, laughing, “and send in Benjy to find out.” “Davy,” he answered, with withering contempt, “you have no more romance in you than a turnip.

One shrub (how well I recall it!) was like unto the perfume of all the flowers and all the fruits, the very essence of the delicious languor of the place that made our steps to falter. A bird shot a bright flame of color through the checkered light ahead of us. Suddenly a sound brought us to a halt, and we stood in a tense and wondering silence. The words of a song, sung carelessly in a clear, girlish voice, came to us from beyond. “Je voudrais bien me marier, Je voudrais bien me marier, Mais j’ai qrand’ peur de me tromper: Mais j’ai grand’ peur de me tromper: Ils sont si malhonnêtes!

The path led through a dense thicket which became a casino hedge, and suddenly I found myself peering over his shoulder into a little garden bewildering in color. In the centre of the garden a great live-oak spread its sheltering branches. Around the gnarled trunk was a seat. And on the seat,--her sewing fallen into her lap, her lips parted, her eyes staring wide, sat the young lady whom we had seen on the levee the evening before. And Nick was making a bow in his grandest manner. “Hélas, Mademoiselle,” he said, “je ne suis pas officier, mais on peut arranger tout cela, sans doute.” My breath was taken away by this unheard-of audacity, and I braced myself against screams, flight, and other feminine demonstrations of terror.",

As he spoke, Mademoiselle turned her back on him. I would not wait for dinner, but pausing only for a sip of cool Madeira and some other refreshment, I made my farewells to the ladies. As I started out of the door to find Benjy, who had been waiting for more than an hour, Mademoiselle gave me a neatly folded note. “You will be so kind as to present that to my father, Monsieur,” she said. CHAPTER XIII. MONSIEUR AUGUSTE ENTRAPPED It may be well to declare here and now that I do not intend to burden this story with the business which had brought me to New Orleans. While in the city during the next few days I met a young gentleman named Daniel Clark, a nephew of that Mr. Clark of whom I have spoken. Many years after the time of which I write this Mr. Daniel Clark the younger, who became a rich merchant and an able man of affairs, published a book which sets forth with great clearness proofs of General Wilkinson’s duplicity and treason, and these may be read by any who would satisfy himself further on the subject. Mr. Wharton had not believed, nor had I flattered myself that I should be able to bring such a fox as General Wilkinson to earth. Abundant circumstantial evidence I obtained: Wilkinson’s intimacy with Miro was well known, and I likewise learned that a cipher existed between them.",

In brief, I may say that I discovered as much as could be discovered by any one without arousing suspicion, and that the information with which I returned to Kentucky was of some material value to my employers. I have to thank Monsieur Philippe de St. Gré for a great deal. And I take this opportunity to set down the fact that I have rarely met a more remarkable man. As I rode back to town alone a whitish film was spread before the sun, and ere I had come in sight of the fortifications the low forest on the western bank was a dark green blur against the sky. The esplanade on the levee was deserted, the willow trees had a mournful look, while the bright tiles of yesterday seemed to have faded to a sombre tone. I spied Xavier on a bench smoking with some friends of his. “He make much rain soon, Michié,” he cried. “You hev good time, I hope, Michié.” I waved my hand and rode on, past the Place d’Armes with its white diagonal bands strapping its green like a soldier’s front, and as I drew up before the gate of the House of the Lions the warning taps of the storm were drumming on the magnolia leaves. The same gardienne came to my knock, and in answer to her shrill cry a negro lad appeared to hold my horse. I was ushered into a brick-paved archway that ran under the latticed gallery toward a flower-filled court-yard, but ere we reached this the gardienne turned to the left up a flight of steps with a delicate balustrade which led to an open gallery above.",

He was dressed in black silk, his hair in a cue, and drawn away from a face of remarkable features. He had a high-bridged nose, a black eye that held an inquiring sternness, a chin indented, and a receding forehead. His stature was indeterminable. In brief, he might have stood for one of those persons of birth and ability who become prime ministers of France. “Monsieur de St. Gré?” I said. He bowed gracefully, but with a tinge of condescension. I was awed, and considering the relations which I had already had with his family, I must admit that I was somewhat frightened. “Monsieur,” I said, “I bring letters to you from Monsieur Gratiot and Colonel Chouteau of St. Louis. One of these I had the honor to deliver to Madame de St. Gré, and here is the other.” “Ah,” he said, with another keen glance, “I met you this morning, did I not?”",

His family in Charlestown is known to me by repute.” “By Madame de St. Gré’s invitation he remained at Les Îles,” I answered, speaking above the roar of the rain. “I was just going to the table,” said Monsieur de St. Gré; “we will talk as we eat.” He led the way into the dining room, and as I stood on the threshold a bolt of great brilliancy lighted its yellow-washed floor and walnut furniture of a staid pattern. A deafening crash followed as we took our seats, while Monsieur de St. Gré’s man lighted four candles of green myrtle-berry wax. “Monsieur Gratiot’s letter speaks vaguely of politics, Mr. Ritchie,” began Monsieur de St. Gré. He spoke English perfectly, save for an occasional harsh aspiration which I cannot imitate. Directing his man to fetch a certain kind of Madeira, he turned to me with a look of polite inquiry which was scarcely reassuring. And I reflected, the caution with which I had been endowed coming uppermost, that the man might have changed since Monsieur Gratiot had seen him.",

Monsieur de St. Gré glanced at me, and an enigmatical smile spread over his face. I knew then that the ice was cracked between us. Yet he was too much a man of the world not to make one more tentative remark. “A union between Kentucky and Louisiana would be a resistless force in the world, Mr. Ritchie,” he said. “It was Nebuchadnezzar who dreamed of a composite image, Monsieur,” I answered; “and Mr. Wilkinson forgets one thing,--that Kentucky is a part of the United States.” At that Monsieur St. Gré laughed outright. He became a different man, though he lost none of his dignity. “I should have had more faith in my old friend Gratiot,” he said; “but you will pardon me if I did not recognize at once the statesman he had sent me, Mr. Ritchie.” It was my turn to laugh. “Monsieur,” he went on, returning to that dignity of mien which marked him, “my political opinions are too well known that I should make a mystery of them to you.",

He sent me to France for my education, where I was introduced at court by my kinsman, the old Marquis, who took a fancy to me and begged me to remain. It was my father’s wish that I should return, and I did not disobey him. I had scarcely come back, Monsieur, when that abominable secret bargain of Louis the Fifteenth became known, ceding Louisiana to Spain. You may have heard of the revolution which followed here. It was a mild affair, and the remembrance of it makes me smile to this day, though with bitterness. I was five and twenty, hot-headed, and French. Que voulez-vous?” and Monsieur de St. Gré shrugged his shoulders. “O’Reilly, the famous Spanish general, came with his men-of-war. Well I remember the days we waited with leaden hearts for the men-of-war to come up from the English turn; and I can see now the cannon frowning from the ports, the grim spars, the high poops crowded with officers, the great anchors splashing the yellow water.

And they drew up as in line of battle in the Place d’Armes,--dragoons, fusileros de montañas, light and heavy infantry. Where were our white cockades then? Fifty guns shook the town, the great O’Reilly limped ashore through the smoke, and Louisiana was lost to France. We had a cowardly governor, Monsieur, whose name is written in the annals of the province in letters of shame. He betrayed Monsieur de St. Gré and others into O’Reilly’s hands, and when my father was cast into prison he was seized with such a fit of anger that he died.” Monsieur de St. Gré was silent. Without, under the eaves of the gallery, a white rain fell, and a steaming moisture arose from the court-yard. “What I have told you, Monsieur, is common knowledge. Louisiana has been Spanish for twenty years. I no longer wear the white cockade, for I am older now.” He smiled. “Strange things are happening in France, and the old order to which I belong” (he straightened perceptibly) “seems to be tottering.",

As we sat talking, my admiration for my host increased, for I found that he was familiar not only with the situation in Kentucky, but that he also knew far more than I of the principles and personnel of the new government of which General Washington was President. That he had little sympathy with government by the people was natural, for he was a Creole, and behind that a member of an order which detested republics. When we were got beyond these topics the rain had ceased, the night had fallen, the green candles had burned low. And suddenly, as he spoke of Les Îsles, I remembered the note Mademoiselle had given me for him, and I apologized for my forgetfulness.

In fact, I came to town for that purpose.” “Lisette--” began Auguste. “Thought that I did not wish to be disturbed, no doubt,” said his father. “Walk in, Auguste.” Monsieur Auguste’s slim figure appeared in the doorway. He caught sight of me, halted, backed, and stood staring with widened eyes. The candles threw their light across his shoulder on the face of the elder Monsieur de St. Gré. Auguste was a replica of his father, with the features minimized to regularity and the brow narrowed. The complexion of the one was a clear saffron, while the boy’s skin was mottled, and he was not twenty. “What is the matter?” said Monsieur de St. Gré. “You--you have a visitor!” stammered Auguste, with a tact that savored of practice.

Dost thou know Monsieur Ritchie, ‘Toinette?” She disengaged herself and dropped me a courtesy, her eyes seeking the ground. But she said not a word. At that instant Madame de St. Gré herself appeared on the gallery, followed by Nick, who came down the steps with a careless self-confidence to greet the master. Indeed, a stranger might have thought that Mr. Temple was the host, and I saw Antoinette watching him furtively with a gleam of amusement in her eyes. “I am delighted to see you at last, Monsieur,” said my cousin. “I am Nicholas Temple, and I have been your guest for three days.” Had Monsieur de St. Gré been other than the soul of hospitality, it would have been impossible not to welcome such a guest. Our host had, in common with his daughter, a sense of humor. There was a quizzical expression on his fine face as he replied, with the barest glance at Mademoiselle Antoinette:-- “I trust you have been--well entertained, Mr.",

My daughter has been accustomed only to the society of her brother and cousins.” “Faith, I should not have supposed it,” said Nick, instantly, a remark which caused the color to flush deeply into Mademoiselle’s face. I looked to see Monsieur de St. Gré angry. He tried, indeed, to be grave, but smiled irresistibly as he mounted the steps to greet his wife, who stood demurely awaiting his caress. And in this interval Mademoiselle shot at Nick a swift and withering look as she passed him. He returned a grimace. “Messieurs,” said Monsieur de St. Gré, turning to us, “dinner will soon be ready--if you will be so good as to pardon me until then.” Nick followed Mademoiselle with his eyes until she had disappeared beyond the hall. She did not so much as turn. Then he took me by the arm and led me to a bench under a magnolia a little distance away, where he seated himself, and looked up at me despairingly. “Behold,” said he, “what was once your friend and cousin, your counsellor, sage, and guardian. Behold the clay which conducted you hither, with the heart neatly but painfully extracted. Look upon a woman’s work, Davy, and shun the sex. I tell you it is better to go blindfold through life, to have--pardon me--your own blunt features, than to be reduced to such a pitiable state. Was ever such a refinement of cruelty practised before? Never! Was there ever such beauty, such archness, such coquetry,--such damned elusiveness?",

I have been put in a grave, the earth stamped down, resurrected, and flung into the dust-heap. I have been taken up to the gate of heaven and dropped a hundred and fifty years through darkness. Since I have seen you I have been the round of all the bright places and all the bottomless pits in the firmament.” “It seems to have made you literary,” I remarked judicially. “I burn up twenty times a day,” he continued, with a wave of the hand to express the completeness of the process; “there is nothing left. I see her, I speak to her, and I burn up.” “Have you had many tête-à-têtes?” I asked. “Not one,” he retorted fiercely; “do you think there is any sense in the damnable French custom?

Sometimes we sew on the gallery,” he went on, “but I give you my oath that I have not had one word with her alone.” “An oath is not necessary,” I said. “But you seem to have made some progress nevertheless.” “Do you call that progress?” he demanded. “It is surely not retrogression.” “God knows what it is,” said Nick, helplessly, “but it’s got to stop. I have sent her an ultimatum.”",

He had not spoken to me of his mother save that once, and I had no means of knowing whether his feeling for the girl might not soften his anger against her. I have never lacked the courage to come to the point, but there was still the chance that I might be mistaken in this after all. Would it not be best to wait until I had ascertained in some way the identity of Mrs. Clive? And while I stood debating, Nick regarding me with a puzzled expression, Monsieur de St. Gré appeared on the gallery. “Come, gentlemen,” he cried; “dinner awaits us.” The dining room at Les Îles was at the corner of the house, and its windows looked out on the gallery, which was shaded at that place by dense foliage. The room, like others in the house, seemed to reflect the decorous character of its owner. Two St. Grés, indifferently painted, but rigorous and respectable, relieved the whiteness of the wall.

The first sensation of our host was no doubt astonishment, but he was soon laughing over a vivid account of our adventures on the keel boat. Nick’s imitation of Xavier, and his description of Benjy’s terrors after the storm, were so perfect that I laughed quite as heartily; and Madame de St. Gré wiped her eyes and repeated continually, “Quel drôle monsieur! it is thus he has entertained us since thou departed, Philippe.” As for Mademoiselle, I began to think that Nick was not far wrong in his diagnosis. Training may have had something to do with it. She would not laugh, not she, but once or twice she raised her napkin to her face and coughed slightly. For the rest, she sat demurely, with her eyes on her plate, a model of propriety. Nick’s sufferings became more comprehensible. To give the devil his due, Nick had an innate tact which told him when to stop, and perhaps at this time Mademoiselle’s superciliousness made him subside the more quickly. After Monsieur de St. Gré had explained to me the horrors of the indigo pest and the futility of sugar raising, he turned to his daughter. “‘Toinette, where is Madame Clive?” he asked.",

It was the day you went away, the day these gentlemen came, that we thought she would take an airing. And suddenly she became worse.” Monsieur de St. Gré turned with concern to his wife. “I do not know what it is, Philippe,” said that lady; “it seems to be mental. The loss of her husband weighs upon her, poor lady. But this is worse than ever, and she will lie for hours with her face turned to the wall, and not even Antoinette can arouse her.” “I have always been able to comfort her before,” said Antoinette, with a catch in her voice.

As I was going to my room Nick stopped me. “Come into the garden, Davy,” he said. “When I have had my siesta,” I answered. “When you have had your siesta!” he cried; “since when did you begin to indulge in siestas?” “To-day,” I replied, and left him staring after me.

Little was needed to convince me now that Mrs. Clive was Mrs. Temple, and thus the lady’s relapse when she heard that her son was in the house was accounted for.

I remembered her in her prime, in her beauty, in her selfishness, in her cruelty to those whom she might have helped, and I wondered the more at the change which must have come over the woman that she had won the affections of this family, that she had gained the untiring devotion of Mademoiselle Antoinette. Her wit might not account for it, for that had been cruel. And something of the agony of the woman’s soul as she lay in torment, facing the wall, thinking of her son under the same roof, of a life misspent and irrevocable, I pictured. A stillness crept into the afternoon like the stillness of night. The wide house was darkened and silent, and without a sunlight washed with gold filtered through the leaves. There was a drowsy hum of bees, and in the distance the occasional languishing note of a bird singing what must have been a cradle-song. My mind wandered, and shirked the task that was set to it. Could anything be gained by meddling? I had begun to convince myself that nothing could, when suddenly I came face to face with the consequences of a possible marriage between Nick and Mademoiselle Antoinette. In that event the disclosure of his mother’s identity would be inevitable. Not only his happiness was involved, but Mademoiselle’s, her father’s and her mother’s, and lastly that of this poor hunted woman herself, who thought at last to have found a refuge.",

Mr. Ritchie assures Mrs. Clive that he makes this request in all friendliness.” I lighted a candle, folded the note and sealed it, addressed it to Mrs. Clive, and opening the latticed door I stepped out. Walking along the gallery until I came to the rear part of the house which faced towards the out-buildings, I spied three figures prone on the grass under a pecan tree that shaded the kitchen roof. One of these figures was Benjy, and he was taking his siesta. I descended quietly from the gallery, and making my way to him, touched him on the shoulder. He awoke and stared at me with white eyes. “Marse Dave!” he cried. “Hush,” I answered, “and follow me.” He came after me, wondering, a little way into the grove, where I stopped. “Benjy,” I said, “do you know any of the servants here?” “Lawsy, Marse Dave, I reckon I knows ‘em,--some of ‘em,” he answered with a grin.",

A quarter of an hour passed, half an hour, and then I saw Benjy coming through the trees. He stood before me, chuckling, and drew from his pocket a folded piece of paper.

Entering a gap in the hedge, I caught sight of the shaded seat under the tree which had been the scene of our first meeting with Antoinette, and I hurried past it as I crossed the garden. There were two openings in the opposite hedge, the one through which Nick and I had come, and another. I took the second, and with little difficulty found the path of which the note had spoken. It led through a dense, semi-tropical forest in the direction of the swamp beyond, the way being well beaten, but here and there jealously crowded by an undergrowth of brambles and the prickly Spanish bayonet. I know not how far I had walked, my head bent in thought, before I felt the ground teetering under my feet, and there was the bayou. It was a narrow lane of murky, impenetrable water, shaded now by the forest wall. Imaged on its amber surface were the twisted boughs of the cypresses of the swamp beyond,--boughs funereally draped, as though to proclaim a warning of unknown perils in the dark places. On that side where I stood ancient oaks thrust their gnarled roots into the water, and these knees were bridged by treacherous platforms of moss.",

It may have been about half-past five, and I made up my mind that, rather than return and risk explanations, I would wait where I was until Mrs. Temple appeared. I had much to think of, and for the rest the weird beauty of the place, with its changing colors as the sun fell, held me in fascination. When the blue vapor stole through the cypress swamp, my trained ear caught the faintest of warning sounds. Mrs. Temple was coming. I could not repress the exclamation that rose to my lips when she stood before me. “I have changed somewhat,” she began quite calmly; “I have changed since you were at Temple Bow.” I stood staring at her, at a loss to know whether by these words she sought to gain an advantage. I knew not whether to pity or to be angry, such a strange blending she seemed of former pride and arrogance and later suffering. There were the features of the beauty still, the eyes defiant, the lips scornful. Sorrow had set its brand upon this protesting face in deep, violet marks under the eyes, in lines which no human power could erase: sorrow had flecked with white the gold of the hair, had proclaimed her a woman with a history.",

She stood facing me, undaunted, and I knew that she had come to fight for what was left her. I knew further that she was no mean antagonist. “Will you kindly tell me to what circumstance I owe the honor of this--summons, Mr. Ritchie?” she asked. “You are a travelled person for one so young.

I marvelled that this woman, with all her self-possession, could be the same as she who had held her room, cowering, these four days past. Admiration for her courage mingled with my other feelings, and for the life of me I knew not where to begin. My experience with women of the world was, after all, distinctly limited.

And then my eyes sought Nick, for Mrs. Temple had faced her son with a movement that was a challenge, yet with a look that questioned, yearned, appealed. He, too, stared, the laughter fading from his eyes, first astonishment, and then anger, growing in them, slowly, surely. I shall never forget him as he stood there (for what seemed an age) recalling one by one the wrongs this woman had done him. She herself had taught him to brook no restraint, to follow impetuously his loves and hates, and endurance in these things was moulded in every line of his finely cut features. And when he spoke it was not to her, but to the girl at his side. “Do you know who this is?” he said. “Tell me, do you know this woman?” Mademoiselle de St. Gré did not answer him. She drew near, gently, to Mrs. Temple, whose head was bowed, whose agony I could only guess. “Mrs. Clive,” she said softly, though her voice was shaken by a prescience, “won’t you tell me what has happened? Won’t you speak to me--Antoinette?” The poor lady lifted up her arms, as though to embrace the girl, dropped them despairingly, and turned away. “Antoinette,” she murmured, “Antoinette!” For Nick had seized Antoinette by the hand, restraining her. “You do not know what you are doing?” he cried angrily.",

I have thought since that I might have pieced together this much of her character. Her glance at Nick surprised him momentarily into silence. “I know that she is my dearest friend,” she said, “that she came to us in misfortune, and that we love her and trust her. I do not know why she is here with Mr. Ritchie, but I am sure it is for some good reason.” She laid a hand on Mrs. Temple’s shoulder. “Mrs. Clive, won’t you speak to me?” “My God, Antoinette, listen!” cried Nick; “Mrs. Clive is not her name. I know her, David knows her. She is an--adventuress!” Mrs. Temple gave a cry, and the girl shot at him a frightened, bewildered glance, in which a new-born love struggled with an older affection. “An adventuress!” she repeated, her hand dropping, “oh, I do not believe it. I cannot believe it.” “You shall believe it,” said Nick, fiercely. “Her name is not Clive. Ask David what her name is.” Antoinette’s lips moved, but she shirked the question. And Nick seized me roughly. “Tell her,” he said, “tell her! My God, how can I do it? Tell her, David.” For the life of me I could not frame the speech at once, my pity and a new-found and surprising respect for her making it doubly hard to pronounce her sentence. Suddenly she raised her head, not proudly, but with a dignity seemingly conferred by years of sorrow and of suffering.",

For she has ruined my life and brought shame on a good name.” He paused, his breath catching for very anger. Mrs. Temple hid her face in her hands, while the girl shrank back in terror. I grasped him by the arm. “Have you no compassion?” I cried. But Mrs. Temple interrupted me. “He has the right,” she faltered; “it is my just punishment.” He tore himself away, and took a step to her. “Where is Riddle?” he cried. “As God lives, I will kill him without mercy!” His mother lifted her head again. “God has judged him,” she said quietly; “he is beyond your vengeance--he is dead.” A sob shook her, but she conquered it with a marvellous courage. “Harry Riddle loved me, he was kind to me, and he was a better man than John Temple.” Nick recoiled. The fierceness of his anger seemed to go, leaving a more dangerous humor. “Then I have been blessed with parents,” he said.

She wept as I have never seen a woman weep. And then, before Nick or I knew what had happened, Antoinette had taken her swiftly in her arms and was murmuring in her ear:-- “You shall not go.

And she tried gently to push the girl away. “No, Antoinette,” she said, “I have done you harm enough.” But the girl clung to her strongly, passionately. “I do not care what you have done,” she cried, “you are good now. I know that you are good now. I will not cast you out. I will not.” I stood looking at them, bewildered and astonished by Mademoiselle’s loyalty. She seemed to have forgotten Nick, as had I, and then as I turned to him he came towards them.

For indeed almost five years had gone by since the warm summer night when I rode into New Orleans with Mrs. Temple. And in all that time I had not so much as laid eyes on my cousin and dearest friend, her son. I searched New Orleans for him in vain, and learned too late that he had taken passage on a packet which had dropped down the river the next morning, bound for Charleston and New York. I have an instinct that this is not the place to relate in detail what occurred to me before leaving New Orleans. Suffice it to say that I made my way back through the swamps, the forests, the cane-brakes of the Indian country, along the Natchez trail to Nashville, across the barrens to Harrodstown in Kentucky, where I spent a week in that cabin which had so long been for me a haven of refuge. Dear Polly Ann! She hugged me as though I were still the waif whom she had mothered, and wept over the little presents which I had brought the children. Harrodstown was changed, new cabins and new faces met me at every turn, and Tom, more disgruntled than ever, had gone a-hunting with Mr. Boone far into the wilderness. I went back to Louisville to take up once more the struggle for practice, and I do not intend to charge so much as a page with what may be called the even tenor of my life.",

The noise of the tramping of great armies across the Old World shook the New, and men in whom the love of fierce fighting was born were stirred to quarrel among themselves. The Rights of Man! How many wrongs have been done under that clause! The Bastille stormed; the Swiss Guard slaughtered; the Reign of Terror, with its daily procession of tumbrels through the streets of Paris; the murder of that amiable and well-meaning gentleman who did his best to atone for the sins of his ancestors; the fearful months of waiting suffered by his Queen before she, too, went to her death. Often as I lighted my candle of an evening in my little room to read of these things so far away, I would drop my Kentucky Gazette to think of a woman whose face I remembered, to wonder sadly whether Hélène de St. Gré were among the lists.

In spite of the Federalists, Louisville prospered, and incidentally I prospered in a mild way.

Mr. Wharton was kind enough to recommend a young lawyer who had the following virtues: he was neither handsome nor brilliant, and he wore snuff-colored clothes. Mr. Wharton also did me the honor to say that I was cautious and painstaking, and had a habit of tiring out my adversary. Therefore, in the early summer of 1793, I went to Philadelphia. At that time, travellers embarking on such a journey were prayed over as though they were going to Tartary. I was absent from Louisville near a year, and there is a diary of what I saw and felt and heard on this trip for the omission of which I will be thanked.

I landed, took the road that led parallel with the river through the tender green of the woods, and as I walked the mighty song which the Falls had sung for ages to the Wilderness rose higher and higher, and the faint spray seemed to be wafted through the forest and to hang in the air like the odor of a summer rain. It was May-day. The sweet, caressing note of the thrush mingled with the music of the water, the dogwood and the wild plum were in festal array; but my heart was heavy with thinking of a great man who had cheapened himself. At length I came out upon a clearing where fifteen log houses marked the grant of the Federal government to Clark’s regiment. Perched on a tree-dotted knoll above the last spasm of the waters in their two-mile race for peace, was a two-storied log house with a little, square porch in front of the door. As I rounded the corner of the house and came in sight of the porch I halted--by no will of my own--at the sight of a figure sunken in a wooden chair. It was that of my old Colonel. His hands were folded in front of him, his eyes were fixed but dimly on the forests of the Kentucky shore across the water; his hair, uncared for, fell on the shoulders of his faded blue coat, and the stained buff waistcoat was unbuttoned. For he still wore unconsciously the colors of the army of the American Republic.",

Among the littered papers on the table were two whiskey bottles and several glasses, and strewn about were a number of chairs, the arms of which had been whittled by the General’s guests. Across the rough mantel-shelf was draped the French tricolor, and before the fireplace on the puncheons lay a huge bearskin which undoubtedly had not been shaken for a year. Picking up a bottle, the General poured out generous helpings in two of the glasses, and handed one to me. “The mists are bad, Davy,” said he; “I--I cannot afford to get the fever now. Let us drink success to the army of the glorious Republic, France.” “Let us drink first, General,” I said, “to the old friendship between us.” “Good!” he cried.

He rose and laid his hands affectionately on my shoulders. “Ah, Davy, commerce makes a man timid. Do you forget the old days when I was the father and you the son? Come!

Suddenly there came, unbidden, his own counsel which he had given me long ago, “Serve the people, as all true men should in a Republic, but do not rely upon their gratitude.” This man had bidden me remember that. “General,” I said, trying to speak steadily, “it was you who gave me my first love for the Republic.

So intently did I stare that I gave no thought to those who followed him. Suddenly, when he was within fifty paces, a cry escaped me,--I should have known that smiling, sallow, weakly handsome face anywhere in the world.

At length, after marching seemingly half the night, they halted by common consent before the house of a prominent Democrat who shall be nameless, and, after some minutes of vain importuning, Nick, with a tattoo on the drum, marched boldly up to the gate and into the yard. A desperate cunning came to my aid. I flung away the torch, leaving the head of the column in darkness, broke from Mr. Handy’s embrace, and, seizing Nick by the arm, led him onward through the premises, he drumming with great docility. Followed by a few stragglers only (some of whom went down in contact with the trees of the orchard), we came to a gate at the back which I knew well, which led directly into the little yard that fronted my own rooms behind Mr.",

As I struck a light something fell to the floor with a crash, an odor of alcohol filled the air, and as the candle caught the flame I saw a shattered whiskey bottle at my feet and a room which had been given over to carousing. In spite of my feelings I could not but laugh at the perfectly irresistible figure my cousin made, as he stood before me with the drum slung in front of him. His hat was gone, his dust-covered clothes awry, but he smiled at me benignly and without a trace of surprise. “Sho you’ve come back at lasht, Davy,” he said. “You’re--you’re very--irregular. You’ll lose--law bishness. Y-you’re worse’n Andy Jackson--he’s always fightin’.” I relieved him, unprotesting, of the drum, thanking my stars there was so much as a stick left of it. He watched me with a silent and exaggerated interest as I laid it on the table. From a distance without came the shouts of the survivors making for the tavern. “‘Sfortunate you had the drum, Davy,” he said gravely, “‘rwe’d had no procession.” “It is fortunate I have it now,” I answered, looking ruefully at the battered rim where Nick had missed the skin in his ardor. “Davy,” said he, “funny thing--I didn’t know you wash a Jacobite.

And was it not the strangest of fates which had impelled him to join this madcap expedition of this other man I loved, George Rogers Clark? I went out, closed the door, and lighting another candle took from my portfolio a packet of letters. Two of them I had not read, having found them only on my return from Philadelphia that morning. They were all signed simply “Sarah Temple,” they were dated at a certain number in the Rue Bourbon, New Orleans, and each was a tragedy in that which it had left unsaid. There was no suspicion of heroics, there was no railing at fate; the letters breathed but the one hope,--that her son might come again to that happiness of which she had robbed him. There were in all but twelve, and they were brief, for some affliction had nearly deprived the lady of the use of her right hand. I read them twice over, and then, despite the lateness of the hour, I sat staring at the candles, reflecting upon my own helplessness. I was startled from this revery by a knock. Rising hastily, I closed the door of my bedroom, thinking I had to do with some drunken reveller who might be noisy. The knock was repeated.

The sight of it gave me a strange sensation, and I can scarcely write of the anger and disgust which surged over me, of the longing to snatch it from his trembling fingers.

I awoke with a start, and sat for some minutes trying to collect my scattered senses. The sun streamed in at my open door, the birds hopped on the lawn, and the various sounds of the bustling life of the little town came to me from beyond. Suddenly, with a glimmering of the mad events of the night, I stood up, walked uncertainly into the back room, and stared at the bed. It was empty. I went back into the outer room; my eye wandered from the shattered whiskey bottle, which was still on the floor, to the table littered with Mrs. Temple’s letters. And there, in the midst of them, lay a note addressed with my name in a big, unformed hand. I opened it mechanically. “Dear Davy,”--so it ran,--“I have gone away, I cannot tell you where. Some day I will come back and you will forgive me. God bless you! NICK.” He had gone away! To New Orleans? I had long ceased trying to account for Nick’s actions, but the more I reflected, the more incredible it seemed to me that he should have gone there, of all places. And yet I had had it from Clark’s own lips (indiscreet enough now!) that Nick and St. Gré were to prepare the way for an insurrection there. My thoughts ran on to other possibilities; would he see his mother? But he had no reason to know that Mrs.",

I made a sufficiently indecorous figure as I ran towards the water-side, barely nodding to my acquaintances on the way. It was a fresh morning, a river breeze stirred the waters of the Bear Grass, and as I stood, scanning the line of boats there, I heard footsteps behind me. I turned to confront a little man with grizzled, chestnut eyebrows. He was none other than the Citizen Gignoux. “You tek ze air, Monsieur Reetchie?” said he. “You look for some one, yes? You git up too late see him off.” I made a swift resolve never to quibble with this man. “So Mr. Temple has gone to New Orleans with the Sieur de St. Gré,” I said. Citizen Gignoux laid a fat finger on one side of his great nose. The nose was red and shiny, I remember, and glistened in the sunlight. “Ah,” said he, “‘tis no use tryin’ hide from you.

All of these were responding more or less sincerely to the cry of the people of Kentucky (every day more passionate) that something be done about Louisiana. But Gignoux seemed of a different feather. Moreover, he had been too shrewd to deny what Colonel Clark would have denied in a soberer moment,--that St. Gré and Nick had gone to New Orleans. “You not spik, Monsieur. You not think they have success. You are not Federalist, no, for I hear you march las’ night with your frien’,--I hear you wave torch.” “You make it your business to hear a great deal, Monsieur Gignoux,” I retorted, my temper slipping a little.

I spent the remaining hours arranging with a young lawyer of my acquaintance to look after my business, and at ten o’clock I was aboard the keel boat with my small baggage.

We passed the Walnut Hills, the Nogales, the moans of the alligators broke our sleep by night, and at length we came to Natchez, ruled over now by that watch-dog of the Spanish King, Gayoso de Lemos.

Shall I confess it?--I had carefully rubbed off the discolorations on the ivory at the back, and the picture lacked now only the gold setting. As for the face, I had a kind of consolation from it. I seemed to draw of its strength when I was tired, of its courage when I faltered. And, during those four days of indecision in Louisville, it seemed to say to me in words that I could not evade or forget, “Go to New Orleans.” It was a sentiment--foolish, if you please--which could not resist. Nay, which I did not try to resist, for I had little enough of it in my life. What did it matter? I should never see Madame la Vicomtesse d’Ivry-le-Tour. She was Hélène to me; and the artist had caught the strength of her soul in her clear-cut face, in the eyes that flashed with wit and courage,--eyes that seemed to look with scorn upon what was mean in the world and untrue, with pity on the weak.",

A saffron heat-haze hung over the river and the city, robbed alike from the yellow waters of the one and the pestilent moisture of the other. It would have been strange indeed if this capital of Louisiana, brought hither to a swamp from the sands of Biloxi many years ago by the energetic Bienville, were not visited from time to time by the scourge! Again I saw the green villas on the outskirts, the verdure-dotted expanse of roofs of the city behind the levee bank, the line of Kentucky boats, keel boats and barges which brought our own resistless commerce hither in the teeth of royal mandates. Farther out, and tugging fretfully in the yellow current, were the aliens of the blue seas, high-hulled, their tracery of masts and spars shimmering in the heat: a full-rigged ocean packet from Spain, a barque and brigantine from the West Indies, a rakish slaver from Africa with her water-line dry, discharged but yesterday of a teeming horror of freight. I looked again upon the familiar rows of trees which shaded the gravelled promenades where Nick had first seen Antoinette. Then we were under it, for the river was low, and the dingy-uniformed officer was bowing over our passports beneath the awning. We walked ashore, Monsieur Vigo and I, and we joined a staring group of keel boatmen and river-men under the willows.",

Over their heads rose the fine new Cathedral, built by the munificence of Don Andreas Almonaster, and beside that the many-windowed, heavy-arched Cabildo, nearly finished, which will stand for all time a monument to Spanish builders. “It is Corpus Christi day,” said Monsieur Vigo; “let us go and see the procession.” Here once more were the bright-turbaned negresses, the gay Creole gowns and scarfs, the linen-jacketed, broad-hatted merchants, with those of soberer and more conventional dress, laughing and chatting, the children playing despite the heat. Many of these people greeted Monsieur Vigo. There were the saturnine, long-cloaked Spaniards, too, and a greater number than I had believed of my own keen-faced countrymen lounging about, mildly amused by the scene. We crossed the square, and with the courtesy of their race the people made way for us in the press; and we were no sooner placed ere the procession came out of the church. Flaming soldiers of the Governor’s guard, two by two; sober, sandalled friars in brown, priests in their robes,--another batch of color; crosses shimmering, tapers emerging from the cool darkness within to pale by the light of day. Then down on their knees to Him who sits high above the yellow haze fell the thousands in the Place d’Armes. For here was the Host itself, flower-decked in white and crimson, its gold-tasselled canopy upheld by four tonsured priests, a sheen of purple under it,--the Bishop of Louisiana in his robes.",

François Louis Hector, Baron de Carondelet, resplendent in his uniform of colonel in the royal army of Spain, his orders glittering on his breast,--pillar of royalty and enemy to the Rights of Man! His eye was stern, his carriage erect, but I seemed to read in his careworn face the trials of three years in this moist capital. After the Governor, one by one, the waiting Associations fell in line, each with its own distinguishing sash. So the procession moved off into the narrow streets of the city, the people in the Place dispersed to new vantage points, and Monsieur Vigo signed me to follow him. “I have a frien’, la veuve Gravois, who lives ver’ quiet. She have one room, and I ask her tek you in, Davy.” He led the way through the empty Rue Chartres, turned to the right at the Rue Bienville, and stopped before an unpretentious house some three doors from the corner. Madame Gravois, elderly, wizened, primp in a starched cotton gown, opened the door herself, fell upon Monsieur Vigo in the Creole fashion; and within a quarter of an hour I was installed in her best room, which gave out on a little court behind. Monsieur Vigo promised to send his servant with my baggage, told me his address, bade me call on him for what I wanted, and took his leave. First, there was Madame Gravois’ story to listen to as she bustled about giving orders to a kinky-haired negro girl concerning my dinner.",

He had come to Louisiana from Toulon, planted indigo, fought a duel, and Madame was a widow. So I condense two hours into two lines. Happily, Madame was not proof against the habits of the climate, and she retired for her siesta. I sought my room, almost suffocated by a heat which defies my pen to describe, a heat reeking with moisture sucked from the foul kennels of the city. I had felt nothing like it in my former visit to New Orleans. It seemed to bear down upon my brain, to clog the power of thought, to make me vacillating. Hitherto my reasoning had led me to seek Monsieur de St. Gré, to count upon that gentleman’s common sense and his former friendship. But now that the time had come for it, I shrank from such a meeting. I remembered his passionate affection for Antoinette, I imagined that he would not listen calmly to one who was in some sort connected with her unhappiness. So a kind of cowardice drove me first to Mrs. Temple. She might know much that would save me useless trouble and blundering. The shadows of tree-top, thatch, and wall were lengthening as I walked along the Rue Bourbon. Heedless of what the morrow might bring forth, the street was given over to festivity. Merry groups were gathered on the corners, songs and laughter mingled in the court-yards, billiard balls clicked in the cabarets.",

The little house opposite! Mrs. Temple, mistress of Temple Bow, had come to this! It was a strange little home indeed, Spanish, one-story, its dormers hidden by a honeycombed screen of terra-cotta tiles. This screen was set on the extreme edge of the roof which overhung the banquette and shaded the yellow adobe wall of the house. Low, unpretentious, the latticed shutters of its two windows giving it but a scant air of privacy,--indeed, they were scarred by the raps of careless passers-by on the sidewalk. The two little battened doors, one step up, were closed. I rapped, waited, and rapped again. The musician across the street stopped his fiddling, glanced at me, smiled knowingly at the children; and they paused in their dance to stare. Then one of the doors was pushed open a scant four inches, a scarlet madras handkerchief appeared in the crack above a yellow face. There was a long moment of silence, during which I felt the scrutiny of a pair of sharp, black eyes. “What yo’ want, Marse?” The woman’s voice astonished me, for she spoke the dialect of the American tide-water.",

A white shell walk divided the garden and ended at the door of a low outbuilding, from the chimney of which blue smoke curled upward in the evening air.

That orange tree which shaded the uneven doorway of the kitchen she had found here. Figs, pomegranates, magnolias; the camellias dazzling in their purity; the blood-red oleanders; the pink roses that hid the crumbling adobe and climbed even to the sloping tiles,--all these had been set out and cared for with her own hands. Ay, and the fragrant bed of yellow jasmine over which she lingered,--Antoinette’s favorite flower. Antoinette’s flowers that she wore in her hair!

First I will answer your questions, and then I shall ask some.” “But I have asked no questions, Madame la Vicomtesse,” I said. “And you are a very simple person, Mr. Ritchie,” continued Madame la Vicomtesse, smiling; “it is what I had been led to suppose. A serious person. As the friend of Mr. Nicholas Temple, as the relation and (may I say?) benefactor of this poor lady here, it is fitting that you should know certain things. I will not weary you with the reasons and events which led to my coming from Europe to New Orleans, except to say that I, like all of my class who have escaped the horrors of the Revolution, am a wanderer, and grateful to Monsieur de St. Gré for the shelter he gives me. His letter reached me in England, and I arrived three months ago.” She hesitated--nay, I should rather say paused, for there was little hesitation in what she did. She paused, as though weighing what she was to say next. “When I came to Les Îles I saw that there was a sorrow weighing upon the family; and it took no great astuteness on my part, Mr. Ritchie, to discover that Antoinette was the cause of it. One has only to see Antoinette to love her. I wondered why she had not married.",

Antoinette really has beauty, she is the daughter of a man of importance in the colony, her strength of character saves her from being listless. I found a girl with originality of expression, with a sense of the fitness of things, devoted to charitable works, who had not taken the veil. That was on her father’s account. As you know, they are inseparable. Monsieur Philippe de St. Gré is a remarkable man, with certain vigorous ideas not in accordance with the customs of his neighbors. It was he who first confided in me that he would not force Antoinette to marry; it was she, at length, who told me the story of Nicholas Temple and his mother.” She paused again, and, reading between the lines, I perceived that Madame la Vicomtesse had become essential to the household at Les Îles. Philippe de St. Gré was not a man to misplace a confidence. “It was then that I first heard of you, Mr. Ritchie, and of the part which you played in that affair. It was then I had my first real insight into Antoinette’s character. Her affection for Mrs. Temple astonished me, bewildered me. The woman had deceived her and her family, and yet Antoinette gave up her lover because he would not take his mother back. Had Mrs. Temple been willing to return to Les Îles after you had providentially taken her away, they would have received her.",

It is not for us to judge any of them. In sending Antoinette away the poor lady denied herself the only consolation that was left to her. Antoinette understood. Every week she has had news of Mrs. Temple from Mr. Clark. And when I came and learned her trouble, Antoinette begged me to come here and be Mrs. Temple’s friend. Mr. Ritchie, she is a very ill woman and a very sad woman,--the saddest woman I have ever known, and I have seen many.” “And Mademoiselle de St. Gré?” I asked. “Tell me about this man for whom Antoinette has ruined her life,” said Madame la Vicomtesse, brusquely. “Is he worth it? No, no man is worth what she has suffered. What has become of him? Where is he? Did you not tell her that you would bring him back?” “I said that I would bring him back if I could,” I answered, “and I meant it, Madame.” Madame la Vicomtesse bit her lip. Had she known me better, she might have smiled. As for me, I was wholly puzzled to account for these fleeting changes in her humor. “You have taken a great deal upon your shoulders, Mr. Ritchie,” she said. “They are from all accounts broad ones.

I began at the wrong end of my narrative, and it was some time before I had my facts arranged in proper sequence. I could not forget that Madame la Vicomtesse was looking at me fixedly. I reviewed Nick’s neglected childhood; painted as well as I might his temperament and character--his generosity and fearlessness, his recklessness and improvidence. His loyalty to those he loved, his detestation of those he hated. I told how, under these conditions, the sins and vagaries of his parents had gone far to wreck his life at the beginning of it. I told how I had found him again with Sevier, how he had come to New Orleans with me the first time, how he had loved Antoinette, and how he had disappeared after the dreadful scene in the garden at Les Îles, how I had not seen him again for five years. Here I hesitated, little knowing how to tell the Vicomtesse of that affair in Louisville. Though I had a sense that I could not keep the truth from so discerning a person, I was startled to find this to be so. “Yes, yes, I understand,” she said quickly.",

But how?” She rose quickly, went to the fireplace, and stood for a moment with her back to me. Suddenly she turned. “It ought not to be difficult, after all. Auguste de St. Gré is a fool, and he confirms what you say of the expedition. He is, indeed, a pretty person to choose for an intrigue of this kind.

She was silent awhile. “It would be a blessing if Monsieur le Baron could hang Auguste privately. As for your cousin, he may be worth saving, after all. I know Monsieur de Carondelet, and he has no patience with conspirators of this sort. I think he would not hesitate to make examples of them. However, we will try to save them.” “We!” I repeated unwittingly. Madame la Vicomtesse looked at me and laughed outright. “Yes,” she said, “you will do some things, I others.

As I hurried along the dark banquettes this thought filled my brain for a time to the exclusion of all others, so strongly is vanity ingrained in us. After all, what did it matter what she thought,--Madame la Vicomtesse d’Ivry-le-Tour? I had never shone, and it was rather late to begin. But I possessed, at least, average common sense, and I had given no proof even of this. I wandered on, not heeding the command which she had given me,--to go home. The scent of camellias and magnolias floated on the heavy air of the night from the court-yards, reminding me of her. Laughter and soft voices came from the galleries. Despite the Terror, despite the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, despite the Rights of Man and the wars and suffering arising therefrom, despite the scourge which might come to-morrow, life went gayly on. The cabarets echoed, and behind the tight blinds lines of light showed where the Creole gentry gamed at their tables, perchance in the very clubs Madame la Vicomtesse had mentioned.",

I paused once with a twinge of remembrance before the long line of the Ursuline convent, with its latticed belfry against the sky. There was the lodge, with its iron gates shut, and the wall which Nick had threatened to climb. As I passed the great square of the new barracks, a sereno (so the night watchmen were called) was crying the hour. I came to the rambling market-stalls, casting black shadows on the river road,--empty now, to be filled in the morning with shouting marchands. The promenade under the willows was deserted, the great river stretched away under the moon towards the forest line of the farther shore, filmy and indistinct.

The three were nowhere to be seen.

Madame Gravois was awaiting me. Was Monsieur mad to remain out at night? Had Monsieur not heard of the yellow fever? Madame Gravois even had prepared some concoction which she poured out of a bottle, and which I took with the docility of a child. Monsieur Vigo had called, and there was a note. A note? It was a small note. I glanced stupidly at the seal, recognized the swan of the St. Gré crest, broke it, and read:-- “Mr. Ritchie will confer a favor upon la Vicomtesse d’Ivry-le-Tour if he will come to Monsieur de St. Gré’s house at eight to-morrow morning.” I bade the reluctant Madame Gravois good night, gained my room, threw off my clothes, and covered myself with the mosquito bar.

Your chief business in life seems to be getting people out of trouble, and I am going to help you with this case.” It was my turn to laugh.",

Suddenly I remembered Gignoux, but even as I was about to tell her of the incident Antoinette appeared in the doorway. She was very pale, but her lips were set with excitement and her eyes shone strangely. She was still in her riding gown, in her hand she carried a leather bag, and behind her stood André with a bundle. “Quick!” she said; “we are wasting time, and he may be gone.” Checking an exclamation which could hardly have been complimentary to Auguste, the Vicomtesse crossed quickly to her and put her arm about her. “We will follow you, mignonne,” she said in French. “Must you come?” said Antoinette, appealingly. “He may not appear if he sees any one.” “We shall have to risk that,” said the Vicomtesse, dryly, with a glance at me. “You shall not go alone, but we will wait a few moments at the hedge.” We took the well-remembered way through the golden-green light under the trees, Antoinette leading, and the sight of the garden brought back to me poignantly the scene in the moonlight with Mrs. Temple. There was no sound save the languid morning notes of the birds and the humming of the bees among the flowers as Antoinette went tremblingly down the path and paused, listening, under the branches of that oak where I had first beheld her. Then, with a little cry, we saw her run forward--into the arms of Auguste de St.",

How long we waited I know not, but at length we heard their voices raised, and without more ado Madame la Vicomtesse, beckoning me, passed quickly through the gap in the hedge and went towards them. I followed with André. Auguste rose with an oath, and then stood facing his cousin like a man struck dumb, his hands dropped. He was a sorry sight indeed, unshaven, unkempt, dark circles under his eyes, clothes torn. “Hélène! You here--in America!” he cried in French, staring at her. “Yes, Auguste,” she replied quite simply, “I am here.” He would have come towards her, but there was a note in her voice which arrested him. “And Monsieur le Vicomte--Henri?” he said. I found myself listening tensely for the answer. “Henri is in Austria, fighting for his King, I hope,” said Madame la Vicomtesse. “So Madame la Vicomtesse is a refugee,” he said with a bow and a smile that made me very angry. “And Monsieur de St. Gré!” I asked. At the sound of my voice he started and gave back, for he had not perceived me. He recovered his balance, such as it was, instantly. “Monsieur seems to take an extraordinary interest in my affairs,” he said jauntily. “Only when they are to the detriment of other persons who are my friends,” I said. “Monsieur has intruded in a family matter,” said Auguste, grandly, still in French.",

He had learned well that effrontery is often the best weapon of an adventurer. He turned from me disdainfully, petulantly, and addressed the Vicomtesse once more. “I wish to be alone with Antoinette,” he said. “No doubt,” said the Vicomtesse. “I demand it,” said Auguste. “The demand is not granted,” said the Vicomtesse; “that is why we have come. Your sister has already made enough sacrifices for you. I know you, Monsieur Auguste de St. Gré,” she continued with quiet contempt. “It is not for love of Antoinette that you have sought this meeting. It is because,” she said, riding down a torrent of words which began to escape from him, “it is because you are in a predicament, as usual, and you need money.”",

She still held the leather bag in her hand. “Perhaps the sum is not enough,” she said; “he has to get to France. Perhaps we could borrow more until my father comes home.” She looked questioningly at us. Madame la Vicomtesse was truly a woman of decision. Without more ado she took the bag from Antoinette’s unresisting hands and put it into mine. I was no less astonished than the rest of them. “Mr. Ritchie will keep this until the negotiations are finished,” said the Vicomtesse. “Negotiations!” cried Auguste, beside himself. “This is insolence, Madame.” “Be careful, sir,” I said. “Auguste!” cried Antoinette, putting her hand on his arm. “Why did you tell them?” he demanded, turning on her. “Because I trust them, Auguste,” Antoinette answered. She spoke without anger, as one whose sorrow has put her beyond it. Her speech had a dignity and force which might have awed a worthier man. His disappointment and chagrin brought him beyond bounds. “You trust them!” he cried, “you trust them when they tell you to give your brother, who is starving and in peril of his life, eight hundred livres? Eight hundred livres, pardieu, and your brother!” “It is all I have, Auguste,” said his sister, sadly. “Ha!” he said dramatically, “I see, they seek my destruction. This man”--pointing at me--“is a Federalist, and Madame la Vicomtesse”--he bowed ironically--“is a Royalist.” “Pish!” said the Vicomtesse, impatiently, “it would be an easy matter to have you sent to the Morro--a word to Monsieur de Carondelet, Auguste.",

Antoinette turned away, her shoulders quivering, and I took a step towards him; but Madame la Vicomtesse made a swift gesture, and I stopped, I know not why. She gave an exclamation so sharp that he flinched physically, as though he had been struck. But it was characteristic of her that when she began to speak, her words cut rather than lashed. “Auguste de St. Gré,” she said, “I know you. The Tribunal is merciful compared to you. There is no one on earth whom you would not torture for your selfish ends, no one whom you would not sell without compunction for your pleasure. There are things that a woman should not mention, and yet I would tell them without shame to your face were it not for your sister. If it were not for her, I would not have you in my presence. Shall I speak of your career in France? There is Valenciennes, for example--” She stopped abruptly. The man was gray, but not on his account did the Vicomtesse stay her speech. She forgot him as though he did not exist, and by one of those swift transitions which thrilled me had gone to the sobbing Antoinette and taken her in her arms, murmuring endearments of which our language is not capable.",

Perhaps you will have more consideration for a stranger. There is a French ship at the Terre aux Bœufs in the English Turn, which sails to-night.

Her breath came quickly, her eyes flashed, her anger made her magnificent. “It is not true,” she cried, “you know it is not true.” He lifted his shoulders and smiled. “You are my brother, and I am ashamed to acknowledge you.

Antoinette’s eyes filled with tears,--tears of pride, of humiliation, ay, and of an anger of which I had not thought her capable. She was indeed a superb creature then, a personage I had not imagined. Gathering up her gown, she passed Auguste and turned on him swiftly. “If you were to bring that to him,” she said, pointing to the bag in my hand, “he would not so much as touch it. To-morrow I shall go to the Ursulines, and I thank God I shall never see you again. I thank God I shall no longer be your sister. Give Monsieur the bundle,” she said to the frightened André, who still stood by the hedge; “he may need food and clothes for his journey.” She left us. We stood watching her until her gown had disappeared amongst the foliage. André came forward and held out the bundle to Auguste, who took it mechanically. Then Madame La Vicomtesse motioned to André to leave, and gave me a glance, and it was part of the deep understanding of her I had that I took its meaning. I had my forebodings at what this last conversation with Auguste might bring forth, and I wished heartily that we were rid of him. “Monsieur de St. Gré,” I said, “I understood you to say that a ship is lying at the English Turn some five leagues below us, on which you are to take passage at once.” He turned and glared at me, some devilish retort on his lips which he held back.",

You are in no situation to demand terms; you must take or leave what is offered you. Last night the man called Gignoux, who was of your party, was at the Governor’s house.” At this he started perceptibly. “Ha, I thought he was a traitor,” he cried. Strangely enough, he did not doubt my word in this. “I am surprised that your father’s house has not been searched this morning,” I continued, astonished at my own moderation. “The sentiments of the Baron de Carondelet are no doubt known to you, and you are aware that your family or your friends cannot save you if you are arrested. You may have this money on two conditions. The first is that you leave the province immediately. The second, that you reveal the whereabouts of Mr. Nicholas Temple.” “Monsieur is very kind,” he replied, and added the taunt, “and well versed in the conduct of affairs of money.” “Does Monsieur de St. Gré accept?” I asked. He threw out his hands with a gesture of resignation. “Who am I to accept?” he said, “a fugitive, an outcast.

He had not the astuteness to be a rogue; oddly, he had the sense to know that he could fool us no longer. “Temple is at Lamarque’s,” he answered sullenly. I glanced questioningly at the Vicomtesse. “Lamarque is an old pensioner of Monsieur de St. Gré’s,” said she; “he has a house and an arpent of land not far below here.” “Exactly,” said Auguste, “and if Mr. Ritchie believes that he will save money by keeping Mr. Temple in Louisiana instead of giving him this opportunity to escape, it is no concern of mine.” I reflected a moment on this, for it was another sensible remark. “It is indeed no concern of yours,” said Madame la Vicomtesse. He shrugged his shoulders. “And now,” he said, “I take it that there are no further conscientious scruples against my receiving this paltry sum.” “I will go with you to your pirogue,” I answered, “when you embark you shall have it.” “I, too, will go,” said Madame la Vicomtesse. “You overwhelm me with civility, Madame,” said the Sieur de St. Gré, bowing low. “Lead the way, Monsieur,” I said.

In silence we followed Auguste through the depths of the woods, turning here and there to avoid a fallen tree or a sink-hole where the water still remained. At length we came out in the glare of the sun and crossed the dusty road to the levee bank. Some forty yards below us was the canoe, and we walked to it, still in silence. Auguste flung in his bundle, and turned to us. “Perhaps Monsieur is satisfied,” he said. I handed him the bag, and he took it with an elaborate air of thankfulness.

At the sight of the gold and silver which Antoinette had hastily collected, he turned to Madame la Vicomtesse. “Should I have the good fortune to meet Monsieur le Vicomte in France, I shall assure him that Madame is in good hands” (he swept an exultant look at me) “and enjoying herself.” I could have flung him into the river, money-bag and all.

I glanced at the Vicomtesse shyly, and turned away again. Her face was all repressed laughter, the expression I knew so well. “I think we should feel better in the shade, Mr. Ritchie,” she said in English, and, leaping lightly down from the bank, crossed the road again. I followed her, perforce. “I will show you the way to Lamarque’s,” she said. “Madame la Vicomtesse!” I cried. Had she no curiosity? Was she going to let pass what Auguste had hinted? Lifting up her skirts, she swung round and faced me. In her eyes was a calmness more baffling than the light I had seen there but a moment since. How to begin I knew not, and yet I was launched. “Madame la Vicomtesse, there was once a certain miniature painted of you.” “By Boze, Monsieur,” she answered, readily enough. The embarrassment was all on my side. “We spoke of it last evening. I remember well when it was taken. It was the costume I wore at Chantilly, and Monsieur le Prince complimented me, and the next day the painter himself came to our hotel in the Rue de Bretagne and asked the honor of painting me.” She sighed. “Ah, those were happy days!",

Perhaps it was because they had the patience to read my letters and the manners to say they liked them.” “Surely not, Madame,” I said. “Monsieur de St. Gré spoke often to me of the wonderful pictures you drew of the personages at court.” Madame la Vicomtesse had an answer on the tip of her tongue.

There was a little flower garden, too, and an orchard. A path of beaten earth led to the door, which was open. There we paused.

Perhaps you will excuse us, Lamarque,” she added graciously, in French. “Madame la Vicomtesse!” said the old man. And, with the tact of his race, he bowed and retired. The Vicomtesse seated herself on one of the rude chairs, and looked at Nick curiously. There was no such thing as embarrassment in her manner, no trace of misgiving that she would not move properly in the affair. Knowing Nick as I did, the difficulty of the task appalled me, for no man was likelier than he to fly off at a misplaced word. Her beginning was so bold that I held my breath, knowing full well as I did that she had chosen the very note. “Sit down, Mr. Temple,” she said. “I wish to speak to you about your mother.” He stopped like a man who had been struck, straightened, and stared at her as though he had not taken her meaning.",

Mrs. Temple did not think herself necessary to my welfare when I was young, and now I have learned to live without her.” “Is there no such thing as expiation, Monsieur?” said the Vicomtesse. “Madame,” he said, “she made me what I am, and when I might have redeemed myself she came between me and happiness.” “Monsieur,” said the Vicomtesse, “have you ever considered her sufferings?” He looked at the Vicomtesse with a new interest. She was not so far beyond his experience as mine. “Her sufferings?” he repeated, and smiled. “Madame la Vicomtesse should know them,” I interrupted; and without heeding her glance of protest I continued, “It is she who has cared for Mrs. Temple.” “You, Madame!” he exclaimed. “Do not deny your own share in it, Mr. Ritchie,” she answered. “As for me, Monsieur,” she went on, turning to Nick, “I have done nothing that was not selfish. I have been in the world, I have lived my life, misfortunes have come upon me too. My visits to your mother have been to me a comfort, a pleasure,--for she is a rare person.” “I have never found her so, Madame,” he said briefly. “I am sure it is your misfortune rather than your fault, Mr. Temple. It is because you do not know her now.” Again he looked at me, puzzled, uneasy, like a man who would run if he could.",

The Vicomtesse began to speak again, evenly, gently. “Mr. Temple,” said she, “I am merely going to tell you some things which I am sure you do not know, and when I have finished I shall not appeal to you. It would be useless for me to try to influence you, and from what Mr. Ritchie and others have told me of your character I am sure that no influence will be necessary.

God Himself does not withhold forgiveness, Mr. Temple,” said the Vicomtesse, gently. “Shall any of us presume to?” A spasm of pain crossed his face, and then his expression hardened. “I might have been a useful man,” he said; “she ruined my life--” “And you will allow her to ruin the rest of it?” asked the Vicomtesse. “If you do not go to her and forgive her, you will remember it until you die,” she said.

We were followed by André and Madame’s maid. The sleepy orderly started up from under the archway at our approach, bowed profoundly to Madame, looked askance at me, and declared, with a thousand regrets, that Monsieur le Baron was having his siesta. “Then you will wake him,” said Madame la Vicomtesse. Wake Monsieur le Baron! Bueno Dios, did Madame understand what it meant to wake his Excellency? His Excellency would at first be angry, no doubt. Angry? As an Andalusian bull, Madame. Once, when his Excellency had first come to the province, he, the orderly, had presumed to awake him. “Assez!” said Madame, so suddenly that the man straightened and looked at her again. “You will wake Monsieur le Baron, and tell him that Madame la Vicomtesse d’Ivry-le-Tour has something of importance to say to him.” Madame had the air, and a title carried with a Spanish soldier in New Orleans in those days. The orderly fairly swept the ground and led us through a court where the sun drew bewildering hot odors from the fruits and flowers, into a darkened room which was the Baron’s cabinet.

These doubtless opened on the Royal Road and looked across the levee esplanade on the waters of the Mississippi.

Suddenly I became aware that she was looking at me. “What are you thinking of?” she demanded, and continued without waiting for a reply, “you strange man.” “I was thinking how odd it was,” I replied, “that I should have known you all these years",

However distasteful, I had the sense to see that I must hold nothing back of which his Excellency might at any time become cognizant, and therefore I told him as briefly as possible Nick’s story, leaving out only the episode with Antoinette. When I came to the relation of the affairs which occurred at Les Îles five years before and told his Excellency that Mrs. Temple had since been living in the Rue Bourbon as Mrs. Clive, unknown to her son, the Baron broke in upon me. “So the mystery of that woman is cleared at last,” he said, and turned to the Vicomtesse. “I have learned that you have been a frequent visitor, Madame.” “Not a sparrow falls to the ground in Louisiana that your Excellency does not hear of it,” she answered. “And Gignoux?” he said, speaking to me again. “As I told you, Monsieur le Baron,” I answered, “I have come to New Orleans at a personal sacrifice to induce my cousin to abandon this matter, and I went out last evening to try to get word of him.” This was not strictly true. “I saw Monsieur Gignoux in conference with some of your officers who came out of this hotel.” “You have sharp eyes, Monsieur,” he remarked. “I suspected the man when I met him in Kentucky,” I continued, not heeding this. “Monsieur Vigo himself distrusted him.",

If I tell you that I have a great respect for your astuteness and ability, do not put it down to flattery. I wish that your countrymen, who are coming down the river like driftwood, more resembled you. As for Citizen Gignoux,” he went on, smiling, and wiping his face, “let not your heart be troubled. His Majesty’s minister at Philadelphia has written me letters on the subject. I am contemplating for Monsieur Gignoux a sea voyage to Havana, and he is at present partaking of my hospitality in the calabozo.” “In the calabozo!” I cried, overwhelmed at this example of Spanish justice and omniscience. “Precisely,” said the Baron, drumming with his fingers on his fat knee. “And now,” he added, “perhaps Madame la Vicomtesse is ready to tell me of the whereabouts of Mr. Temple and her estimable cousin, Auguste. It may interest her to know why I have allowed them their liberty so long.” “A point on which I have been consumed with curiosity--since I have begun to tremble at the amazing thoroughness of your Excellency’s system,” said the Vicomtesse. His Excellency scarcely looked the tyrant as he sat before us, with his calves crossed and his hands folded on his waistcoat and his little black eyes twinkling.",

They are at old Lamarque’s, on the plantation of Philippe de St. Gré.” “They were, your Excellency,” said the Vicomtesse. “Eh?” exclaimed the Baron, jumping. “Mademoiselle de St. Gré has given her brother eight hundred livres, and he is probably by this time on board a French ship at the English Turn. He is very badly frightened. I will give your Excellency one more surprise.” “Madame la Vicomtesse,” said the Baron, “I have heard that, but for your coolness and adroitness, Monsieur le Vicomte, your husband, and several other noblemen and their ladies and some of her Majesty’s letters and jewels would never have gotten out of France.",

To say that I was bewildered by this last evidence of the insight of the woman beside me would be to put it mildly. The Vicomtesse sat quietly watching him, the wonted look of repressed laughter on her face, and by degrees his Excellency grew calm again. “Mon Dieu,” said he, “I always like to cross swords with you, Madame la Vicomtesse, yet this encounter has been more pleasurable than any I have had since I came to Louisiana. But, diable,” he cried, “just as I was congratulating myself that I was to have one American the less, you come and tell me that he has refused to flee. Out of consideration for the character and services of Monsieur Philippe de St. Gré I was willing to let them both escape. But now?” “Mr. Temple is not known in New Orleans except to the St. Gré family,” said the Vicomtesse. “He is a man of honor.

He will not then be seen in custody by any one, and provided I am satisfied with him he may go to the Rue Bourbon.” The little Baron rose and bowed to the Vicomtesse to signify that the audience was ended, and he added, as he kissed her hand, “Madame la Vicomtesse, it is a pleasure to be able to serve such a woman as you.”",

And after the astonishing conversation from which we had come, my admiration for the lady beside me was magnified to a veritable awe. We reached the archway. Madame la Vicomtesse held me lightly by the edge of my coat, and I stood looking down at her. “Wait a minute, Mr. Ritchie,” she said, glancing at the few figures hurrying across the Place d’Armes; “those are only Americans, and they are too busy to see us standing here. What do you propose to do now?” “We must get word to Nick as we promised, that he may know what to expect,” I replied. “Suppose we go to Monsieur de St. Gré’s house and write him a letter?” “No,” said the Vicomtesse, with decision, “I am going to Mrs. Temple’s. I shall write the letter from there and send it by André, and you will go direct to Madame Gravois’s.” Her glance rested anxiously upon my face, and there came an expression in her eyes which disturbed me strangely. I had not known it since the days when Polly Ann used to mother me. But I did not mean to give up. “I am not tired, Madame la Vicomtesse,” I answered, “and I will go with you to Mrs. Temple’s.” “Give me your hand,” she said, and smiled. “André and my maid are used to my vagaries, and your own countrymen will not mind.

The same anxious look was in her eyes, and not the least embarrassment. “There, it is hot and dry, as I feared,” she said, “and you seem flushed.” She dropped my hand, and there was a touch of irritation in her voice as she continued: “You seemed fairly sensible when I first met you last night, Mr. Ritchie. Are you losing your sanity? Do you not realize that you cannot take liberties with this climate? Do as I say, and go to Madame Gravois’s at once.” “It is my pleasure to obey you, Madame la Vicomtesse,” I answered, “but I mean to go with you as far as Mrs. Temple’s, to see how she fares. She may be--worse.” “That is no reason why you should kill yourself,” said Madame, coldly. “Will you not do as I say?” “I think that I should go to Mrs. Temple’s,” I answered. She did not reply to that, letting down her veil impatiently, with a deftness that characterized all her movements. Without so much as asking me to come after her, she reached the banquette, and I walked by her side through the streets, silent and troubled by her displeasure. My pride forbade me to do as she wished. It was the hottest part of a burning day, and the dome of the sky was like a brazen bell above us. We passed the the calabozo with its iron gates and tiny grilled windows pierced in the massive walls, behind which Gignoux languished, and I could not repress a smile as I thought of him.",

I looked at Madame la Vicomtesse, and knocked again so loudly that the little tailor across the street, his shirt opened at the neck, flung out his shutter.

And Madame la Vicomtesse, raising her veil, seized the girl by the arm. “What is it?” she said. “What is the matter, Lindy?” Madame’s touch seemed to steady her. “Miss Sally,” she moaned, “Miss Sally done got de yaller fever.” There was a moment’s silence, for we were both too appalled by the news to speak. “Lindy, are you sure?” said the Vicomtesse. “Yass’m, yass’m,” Lindy sobbed, “I reckon I’se done seed ‘nuf of it, Mistis.” And she went into a hysterical fit of weeping. The Vicomtesse turned to her own frightened servants in the doorway, bade André in French to run for Dr. Perrin, and herself closed the battened doors. There was a moment when her face as I saw it was graven on my memory, reflecting a knowledge of the evils of this world, a spirit above and untouched by them, a power to accept what life may bring with no outward sign of pleasure or dismay.",

The throbbing in my head was gone, and a great clearness had come with a great fear. I stood, I know not how long, listening to the groans that came through the wall, for Mrs. Temple was in agony. At intervals I heard Hélène’s voice, and then the groans seemed to stop. Ten times I went to the bedroom door, and as many times drew away again, my heart leaping within me at the peril which she faced. If I had had the right, I believe I would have carried her away by force. But I had not the right. I sat down heavily, by the table, to think, and it might have been a cry of agony sharper than the rest that reminded me once more of the tragedy of the poor lady in torture.

There was an epidemic, Monsieur, so André feared. I gave him the note and his directions, and ten minutes after he had gone I would have given much to have called him back. How about Antoinette, alone at Les Îles? Why had I not thought of her? We had told her nothing that morning, Madame la Vicomtesse and I, after our conference with Nick.

After many years I dislike to recall to memory that long afternoon which I spent, helpless, in the Rue Bourbon. Now I was on my feet, pacing restlessly the short breadth of the room, trying to shut out from my mind the horrors of which my ears gave testimony. Again, in the intervals of quiet, I sat with my elbows on the table and my head in my hands, striving to allay the throbbing in my temples. Pains came and went, and at times I felt like a fagot flung into the fire,--I, who had never known a sick day. At times my throat pained me, an odd symptom in a warm climate. Troubled as I was in mind and body, the thought of Hélène’s quiet heroism upheld me through it all. More than once I had my hand raised to knock at the bedroom door and ask if I could help, but I dared not; at length, the sun having done its worst and spent its fury, I began to hear steps along the banquette and voices almost at my elbow beyond the little window. At every noise I peered out, hoping for the doctor. But he did not come. And then, as I fell back into the fauteuil, there was borne on my consciousness a sound I had heard before. It was the music of the fiddler, it was a tune I knew, and the voices of the children were singing the refrain:-- “Ne sait quand reviendra, Ne sait quand reviendra.” I rose, opened the door, and slipped out of it, and I must have made a strange, hatless figure as I came upon the fiddler and his children from across the street.",

She had no thought of consulting the man again, of asking his permission. Although she wrote rapidly, five minutes must have gone by before the note was finished and folded and sealed. She held it out to him. “Take this to his Excellency,” she said, “and bring me his answer.” The Alcalde bowed, murmured her title, and went lamely out of the house. He was plainly in an agony of uncertainty as to his duty, but he glanced at the Vicomtesse--and went, flipping the note nervously with his finger nail. He paused for a few low-spoken words with the tawdry constable, who sat down on the banquette after his chief had gone, still clinging to the bridle. The Vicomtesse went to the doorway, looked at him, and closed the battened doors. The constable did not protest. The day was fading without, and the room was almost in darkness as she crossed over to the little mantel and stood with her head laid upon her arm. I did not disturb her. The minutes passed, the light waned until I could see her no longer, and yet I knew that she had not moved. The strange sympathy between us kept me silent until I heard her voice calling my name.",

The greatest part of my life seemed to have passed since then. I remember wondering that she did not look tired. Her face was sad, her voice was sad, and it had an ineffable, sweet quality at such times that was all its own. “The Alcalde should be coming back,” she said. These were our words, yet we scarce heeded their meaning. Between us was drawn a subtler communion than speech, and we dared--neither of us--to risk speech. She searched my face, but her lips were closed. She did not take my hand again as in the afternoon. She turned away. I knew what she would have said. There was a knock at the door. We went together to open it, and the Alcalde stood on the step. He held in his hand a long letter on which the red seal caught the light, and he gave the letter to the Vicomtesse, with a bow. “From his Excellency, Madame la Vicomtesse.” She broke the seal, went to the table, and read. Then she looked up at me. “It is the Governor’s permit for Mr. Temple to remain in this house. Thank you,” she said to the Alcalde; “you may go.” “With my respectful wishes for the continued good health of Madame la Vicomtesse,” said the Alcalde. CHAPTER XI. “IN THE MIDST OF LIFE” The Alcalde had stopped on the step with an exclamation at something in the darkness outside, and he backed, bowing, into the room again to make way for some one.",

The girl did not answer at once. Her suffering seemed to have brought upon her a certain acceptance of misfortune as inevitable. Her face, framed in the black veil, was never more beautiful than on that night. “What is the Alcalde doing here?” she said. The officer himself answered the question. “I am leaving, Mademoiselle,” said he. He reached out his hands toward her, appealingly. “Do you not remember me, Mademoiselle? You brought the good sister to see my wife.” “I remember you,” said Antoinette. “Do not stay here, Mademoiselle!” he cried. “There is--there is yellow fever.” “So that is it,” said Antoinette, unheeding him and looking at her cousin. “She has yellow fever, then?” “I beg you to come away, Mademoiselle!” the man entreated. “Please go,” she said to him. He looked at her, and went out silently, closing the doors after him. “Why was he here?” she asked again. “He came to get Mr. Temple, my dear,” said the Vicomtesse. The girl’s lips framed his name, but did not speak it. “Where is he?” she asked slowly. The Vicomtesse pointed towards the bedroom. “In there,” she answered, “with his mother.” “He came to her?” Antoinette asked quite simply. The Vicomtesse glanced at me, and drew the veil gently from the girl’s shoulders.",

Both had suffered cruelly; one had seen the world, the other had not, and yet the contrast lay not here. Both had followed the gospel of helpfulness to others, but one as a religieuse, innocent of the sin around her, though poignant of the sorrow it caused. The other, knowing evil with an insight that went far beyond intuition, fought with that, too. “I will tell you, Antoinette,” began the Vicomtesse; “it was as you said. Mr. Ritchie and I found him at Lamarque’s. He had not taken your money; he did not even know that Auguste had gone to see you. He did not even know,” she said, bending over the girl, “that he was on your father’s plantation. When we told him that, he would have left it at once.”",

It was as much as we could do to persuade him to wait until we had seen Monsieur de Carondelet.

These things were done; the tact and skill and character of her who had accomplished them were not spoken of. The girl listened immovable, her lips parted and her eyes far away. Suddenly, with an awakening, she turned to Hélène. “You did this!” she cried. “Mr. Ritchie and I together,” said the Vicomtesse. Her next exclamation was an odd one, showing how the mind works at such a time. “But his Excellency was having his siesta!” said Antoinette. Again Hélène glanced at me, but I cannot be sure that she smiled. “We thought the matter of sufficient importance to awake his Excellency,” said Hélène. “And his Excellency?” asked Antoinette. In that moment all three of us seemed to have forgotten the tragedy behind the wall. “His Excellency thought so, too, when we had explained it sufficiently,” Hélène answered. The girl seemed suddenly to throw off the weight of her grief. She seized the hand of the Vicomtesse in both of her own. “The Baron pardoned him?” she cried.",

He galloped past the sentry at the gate, and the Alcalde followed him from there.” “And came here to arrest him?” cried Antoinette.

So they met again after many years, and she who had parted them had brought them together once more. He came a step into the room, as though her eyes had drawn him so far. Even then he did not speak her name. “Go,” he said. “Go, you must not stay here. Go!” “I was going,” she answered. “I--I am going.” “But you must go at once,” he cried excitedly. “Do you know what is in there?” and he pointed towards the bedroom. “Yes, yes, I know,” she said, “I know.” “Then go,” he cried. “As it is you have risked too much.” She lifted up her head and looked at him. There was a new-born note in her voice, a tremulous note of joy in the midst of sorrow. It was of her he was thinking! “And you?” she said. “You have come and remained.” “She is my mother,” he answered. “God knows it was the least I could have done.” Twice she had changed before our eyes, and now we beheld a new and yet more startling transformation. When she spoke there was no reproach in her voice, but triumph. Antoinette undid her veil. “Yes, she is your mother,” she answered; “but for many years she has been my friend.",

Then as his eyes went back, irresistibly, to the other, a light that was wonderful to see dawned and grew in them. I shall never forget him as he stood, handsome and fearless, a gentleman still, despite his years of wandering and adventure, and in this supreme moment unselfish. The wilful, masterful boy had become a man at last. He started forward, stopped, trembling with a shock of remembrance, and gave back again. “You cannot come,” he said; “I cannot let you take this risk. Tell her she cannot come, Madame,” he said to Hélène. “For the love of God send her home again.” But there were forces which even Hélène could not stem. He had turned to go back, he had seized the door, but Antoinette was before him. Custom does not weigh at such a time. Had she not read his avowal? She had his hand in hers, heedless of us who watched. At first he sought to free himself, but she clung to it with all the strength of her love,--yet she did not look up at him. “I will come with you,” she said in a low voice, “I will come with you, Nick.” How quaintly she spoke his name, and gently, and timidly--ay, and with a supreme courage. True to him through all those numb years of waiting, this was a little thing--that they should face death together. A little thing, and yet the greatest joy that God can bestow upon a good woman. He looked down at her with a great tenderness, he spoke her name, and I knew that he had taken her at last into his arms.",

Again, I was in the garden at Les Îles on a night that was all perfume, and I saw the flowers all ghostly white under the moon. And then, suddenly, I was watching the green candle sputter, and out of the stillness came a cry--the sereno calling the hour of the night. How my head throbbed! It was keeping time to some rhythm, I knew not what. Yes, it was the song my father used to sing:-- “I’ve faught on land? I’ve faught at sea, At hame I’ve faught my aunty, O!” But New Orleans was hot, burning hot, and this could not be cold I felt. Ah, I had it, the water was cold going to Vincennes, so cold! A voice called me. No matter where I had gone, I think I would have come back at the sound of it. I listened intently, that I might lose no word of what it said. I knew the voice. Had it not called to me many times in my life before? But now there was fear in it, and fear gave it a vibrant sweetness, fear gave it a quality that made it mine--mine. That was all it said, and it called from across the sea.",

Another voice answered in a strange tongue, saying seemingly:-- “Oui, Madame--malé couri--bon djé--malé couri!” I heard the doors close, and the sound of footsteps running and dying along the banquette, and after that my shoulders were raised and something wrapped about them. Then stillness again, the stillness that comes between waking and sleeping, between pain and calm. And at times when I felt her hand fall into mine or press against my brow, the pain seemed more endurable. After that I recall being lifted, being borne along. I opened my eyes once and saw, above a tile-crowned wall, the moon all yellow and distorted in the sky. Then a gate clicked, dungeon blackness, half-light again, ascent, oblivion.",

At times, when my mind was gone from me, I cried out I know not what of jargon, of sentiment, of the horrors I had beheld in my life. I lived again the pleasant scenes, warped and burlesqued almost beyond cognizance, and the tragedies were magnified a hundred fold. Thus it would be: on the low, white ceiling five cracks came together, and that was a device. And the device would take on color, red-bronze like the sumach in the autumn and streaks of vermilion, and two glowing coals that were eyes, and above them eagles’ feathers, and the cracks became bramble bushes. I was behind the log, and at times I started and knew that it was a hideous dream, and again Polly Ann was clutching me and praying me to hold back, and I broke from her and splashed over the slippery limestone bed of the creek to fight single-handed. Through all the fearful struggle I heard her calling me piteously to come back to her. When the brute got me under water I could not hear her, but her voice came back suddenly (as when a door opens) and it was like the wind singing in the poplars. Was it Polly Ann’s voice? Again, I sat with Nick under the trees on the lawn at Temple Bow, and the world was dark with the coming storm. I knew and he knew that the storm was brewing that I might be thrust out into it.",

I was in the prairie, and it was scorched and brown to the horizon. I searched and prayed pitifully for water,--for only a sip of the brown water with the specks in it that was in the swamp. There were no swamps. I was on the bed in the cabin looking at the shifts and hunting shirts on the pegs, and Polly Ann would bring a gourdful of clear water from the spring as far as the door. Nay, once I got it to my lips, and it was gone. Sometimes a young man in a hunting shirt, square-shouldered, clear-eyed, his face tanned and his fair hair bleached by the sun, would bring the water. He was the hero of my boyhood, and part of him indeed was in me. And I would have followed him again to Vincennes despite the tortures of the damned. But when I spoke his name he grew stouter before me, and his eyes lost their lustre and his hair turned gray; and his hand shook as he held out the gourd and spilled its contents ere I could reach them.",

Once--perhaps a score of times, I cannot tell--was limned on the ceiling, where the cracks were, her miniature, and I knew what was coming and shuddered and cried aloud because I could not stop it. I saw the narrow street of a strange city deep down between high houses,--houses with gratings on the lowest windows, with studded, evil-looking doors, with upper stories that toppled over to shut out the light of the sky, with slated roofs that slanted and twisted this way and that and dormers peeping from them. Down in the street, instead of the King’s white soldiers, was a foul, unkempt rabble, creeping out of its damp places, jesting, cursing, singing.",

I watched them a long, long time, and it seemed incredible that they should still remain cracks. Beyond that I would not go, into speculation I dared not venture. They remained cracks, and I went to sleep thanking God. When I awoke a breeze came in cool, fitful gusts, and on it the scent of camellias. I thought of turning my head, and I remember wondering for a long time over the expediency of this move. What would happen if I did! Perhaps the visions would come back, perhaps my head would come off. Finally I decided to risk it, and the first thing that I beheld was a palm-leaf fan, moving slowly. That fact gave me food for thought, and contented me for a while. Then I hit upon the idea that there must be something behind the fan.

You are tired.” “I am not tired,” answered the first voice. “I do not see how you have stood it,” said the man’s voice. “You will kill yourself, Madame la Vicomtesse. The danger is past now.” “I hope so, Mr. Temple,” said the first voice. “Please go away. You may come back in half an hour.” I heard the footsteps retreating. Then I said: “I am not asleep.” The fan stopped for a brief instant and then went on vibrating inexorably. I was entranced at the thought of what I had done. I had spoken, though indeed it seemed to have had no effect. Could it be that I hadn’t spoken? I began to be frightened at this, when gradually something crept into my mind and drove the fear out.

You have--other responsibilities now.” He laughed. It was the old buoyant, boyish laugh of sheer happiness, and I felt the better for hearing it. “If you begin to preach, parson, I’ll go; I vow I’ll have no more sermonizing. Davy,” he cried, “isn’t she just the dearest, sweetest, most beautiful person in the world?” “Where is she?” I asked, temporizing. Nick was not a subtle person, and I was ready to follow him at great length in the praise of Antoinette. “I hope she is not here.” “We made her go to Les Îles,” said he. “And you risked your life and stayed here without her?” I said. “As for risking life, that kind of criticism doesn’t come well from you. And as for Antoinette,” he added with a smile, “I expect to see something of her later on.” “Well,” I answered with a sigh of supreme content, “you have been a fool all your life, and I hope that she will make you sensible.” “You never could make me so,” said Nick, “and besides, I don’t think you’ve been so damned sensible yourself.” We were silent again for a space. “Davy,” he asked, “do you remember what I said when you had that miniature here?” “You said a great many things, I believe.” “I told you to consider carefully the masterful features of that lady, and to thank God you hadn’t married her.",

If I had had the strength, I would have risen then and there from my bed, I would have fled from the city at the first opportunity. As it was, I lay in a torture of thought, living over again every part of my life which she had touched. I remembered the first long, yearning look I had given the miniature at Madame Bouvet’s. I had not loved her then. My feeling rather had been a mysterious sympathy with and admiration for this brilliant lady whose sphere was so far removed from mine. This was sufficiently strange. Again, in the years of my struggle for livelihood which followed, I dreamed of her; I pictured her often in the midst of the darkness of the Revolution. Then I had the miniature again, which had travelled to her, as it were, and come back to me. Even then it was not love I felt, but an unnamed sentiment for one whom I clothed with gifts and attributes I admired: constancy, an ability to suffer and to hide, decision, wit, refuge for the weak, scorn for the false. So I named them at random and cherished them, knowing that these things were not what other men longed for in women.",

There she was now enthroned, deified; that she would always be there I accepted. That I would never say or do anything not in consonance with her standards I knew. That I would suffer much I was sure, but the lees of that suffering I should hoard because they came from her. What might have been I tried to put away.

And as I looked at the green trees in the courtyard, vaguely troubled by I knew not what, some one came and stood in the doorway. It was Nick. “You don’t seem very cheerful,” said he; “a man ought to be who has been snatched out of the fire.” “You seem to be rather too sure of my future,” I said, trying to smile. “That’s more like you,” said Nick. “Egad, you ought to be happy--we all ought to be happy--she’s gone.” “She!” I cried. “Who’s gone?” “Madame la Vicomtesse,” he replied, rubbing his hands as he stood over me. “But she’s left instructions with me for Lindy as long as Monsieur de Carondelet’s Bando de Buen Gobierno. You are not to do this, and you are not to do that, you are to eat such and such things, you are to be made to sleep at such and such times. She came in here about an hour ago and took a long look at you before she left.” “She was not ill?” I said faintly. “Faith, I don’t know why she was not,” he said. “She has done enough to tire out an army. But she seems well and fairly happy. She had her joke at my expense as she went through the court-yard, and she reminded me that we were to send a report by André every day.” Chagrin, depression, relief, bewilderment, all were struggling within me. “Where did she go?” I asked at last.",

It was in the night watches that my struggles came--though often some unwitting speech of his would bring back the pain. He took delight in telling me, for example, how for hours at a time I had been in a fearful delirium. “The Lord knows what foolishness you talked, Davy,” said he. “It would have done me good to hear you had you been in your right mind.” “But you did hear me,” I said, full of apprehensions. “Some of it,” said he. “You were after Wilkinson once, in a burrow, I believe, and you swore dreadfully because he got out of the other end.",

Monsieur Perrin was not much of a doctor, to be sure, and he had a heartier dread of the American invasion than of the scourge. He worshipped the Vicomtesse, and was so devoid of professional pride as to give her freely all credit for my recovery. He too, clothed her with the qualities of statesmanship. “Ha, Monsieur,” he said, “if that lady had been King of France, do you think there would have been any States General, any red bonnets, any Jacobins or Cordeliers? Parbleu, she would have swept the vicemongers and traitors out of the Palais Royal itself. There would have been a house-cleaning there.

His company was most agreeable when he was recounting the many adventures he had had during the five years after he had left New Orleans and been lost to me. These would fill a book, and a most readable book it would be if written in his own speech. His love for the excitement of the frontier had finally drawn him back to the Cumberland country near Nashville, and he had actually gone so far as to raise a house and till some of the land which he had won from Darnley. It was perhaps characteristic of him that he had named the place “Rattle-and-Snap” in honor of the game which had put him in possession of it, and “Rattle-and-Snap” it remains to this day. He was going back there with Antoinette, so he said, to build a brick mansion and to live a respectable life the rest of his days.

What their talk had been I never knew, for the subject was too painful to be dwelt upon, and the conversation had been marked by frankness on both sides. Monsieur de St. Gré was a just man, his love for his daughter was his chief passion, and despite all that had happened he liked Nick. I believe he could not wholly blame the younger man, and he forgave him. Mrs. Temple, poor lady, had died on that first night of my illness, and it was her punishment that she had not known her son or her son’s happiness. Whatever sins she had committed in her wayward life were atoned for, and by her death I firmly believe that she redeemed him. She lies now among the Temples in Charleston, and on the stone which marks her grave is cut no line that hints of the story of these pages. One bright morning, when Nick and I were playing cards, we heard some one mounting the stairs, and to my surprise and embarrassment I beheld Monsieur de St. Gré emerging on the gallery. He was in white linen and wore a broad hat, which he took from his head as he advanced. He had aged somewhat, his hair was a little gray, but otherwise he was the firm, dignified personage I had admired on this same gallery five years before. “Good morning, gentlemen,” he said in English; “ha, do not rise, sir” (to me).

He was a bachelor, which does not mean that he had lacked consolations. He was reserved with his equals, and distant with others. He had served in the Guards, and did not lack courage. He dressed exquisitely, was inclined to the Polignac party, took his ease everywhere, had a knowledge of cards and courts, and little else. He was cheated by his stewards, refused to believe that the Revolution was serious, and would undoubtedly have been guillotined had the Vicomtesse not contrived to get him out of France in spite of himself. They went first to the Duke de Ligne, at Bel Oeil, and thence to Coblentz. He accepted a commission in the Austrian service, which is much to his credit, and Hélène went with some friends to England. There my letter reached her, and rather than be beholden to strangers or accept my money there, she came to us. That is her story in brief, Messieurs.

Last of all was the thought of the Englishman whom I resembled. She would go back to him. Nick was the first in my room the next morning. He had risen early (so he ingenuously informed me) because Antoinette had a habit of getting up with the birds, and as I drank my coffee he was emphatic in his denunciations of the customs of the country. “It is a wonderful day, Davy,” he cried; “you must hurry and get out. Monsieur de St. Gré sends his compliments, and wishes to know if you will pardon his absence this morning. He is going to escort Antoinette and me over to see some of my prospective cousins, the Bertrands.” He made a face, and bent nearer to my ear. “I swear to you I have not had one moment alone with her. We have been for a walk, but Madame la Vicomtesse must needs intrude herself upon us. Egad, I told her plainly what I thought of her tyranny.” “And what did she say?” I asked, trying to smile.",

It was made to walk among the trees and flowers, it is as simple as you please; and yet it has a distinction that makes you stare.” “You seem to have stared,” I answered. “Since when did you take such interest in gowns?” “Bless you, it was Antoinette. I never should have known,” said he. “Antoinette had never before seen the gown, and she asked the Vicomtesse where she got the pattern. The Vicomtesse said that the gown had been made by Léonard, a court dressmaker, and it was of the fashion the Queen had set to wear in the gardens of the Trianon when simplicity became the craze. Antoinette is to have it copied, so she says.” Which proved that Antoinette was human, after all, and happy once more. “Hang it,” said Nick, “she paid more attention to that gown than to me. Good-by, Davy. Obey the--the Colonel.” “Is--is not the Vicomtesse going with you?” I asked. “No, I’m sorry for you,” he called back from the gallery.

Hearing that I was awake, he had come in person to make his excuses for leaving me that morning. “Bon Dieu!” he said, looking at me, “the country has done you good already. Behold a marvel! Au revoir, David.” I heard the horses being brought around, and laughter and voices. How easily I distinguished hers! Then I heard the hoof-beats on the soft dirt of the drive. Then silence,--the silence of a summer morning which is all myriad sweet sounds. Then Lindy appeared, starched and turbaned. “Marse Dave, how you feel dis mawnin’? Yo’ ‘pears mighty peart, sholy. Marse Dave, yo’ chair is sot on de gallery. Is you ready?

A great cushioned chair had been placed there, and beside it a table with books, and another chair. I sat down. Lindy looked at me sharply, but I did not heed her, and presently she retired. The day, still in its early golden glory, seemed big with prescience. Above, the saffron haze was lifted, and there was the blue sky. The breeze held its breath; the fragrance of grass and fruit and flowers, of the shrub that vied with all, languished on the air. Out of these things she came. I knew that she was coming, but I saw her first at the gallery’s end, the roses she held red against the white linen of her gown.",

Her dress, her carriage, her air, all suggested it; and she might, as Nick said, have been walking in the gardens of the Trianon. Titles I cared nothing for. Hers alone seemed real, to put her far above me. Had all who bore them been as worthy, titles would have meant much to mankind. She was coming swiftly. I rose to my feet before her. I believe I should have risen in death. And then she was standing beside me, looking up into my face. “You must not do that,” she said, “or I will go away.” I sat down again. She went to the door and called, I following her with my eyes. Lindy came with a bowl of water. “Put it on the table,” said the Vicomtesse. Lindy put the bowl on the table, gave us a glance, and departed silently. The Vicomtesse began to arrange the flowers in the bowl, and I watched her, fascinated by her movements. She did everything quickly, deftly, but this matter took an unconscionable time. She did not so much as glance at me. She seemed to have forgotten my presence. “There,” she said at last, giving them a final touch. “You are less talkative, if anything, than usual this morning, Mr. Ritchie. You have not said good morning, you have not told me how you were--you have not even thanked me for the roses. One might almost believe that you are sorry to come to Les Îles.” “One might believe anything who didn’t know, Madame la Vicomtesse.” She put her hand to the flowers again.",

So many of us were steeped in selfishness and vice, were a burden on the world. The early nobles, with all their crimes, were men who carved their way. Of such were the lords of the Marches. We toyed with politics, with simplicity, we wasted the land, we played cards as our coaches passed through famine-stricken villages. The reckoning came. Our punishment was not given into the hands of the bourgeois, who would have dealt justly, but to the scum, the canaille, the demons of the earth.",

I saw their failings and pretensions, but I ignored my own. It was the same at Abbaye aux Bois, the convent where I was taught. When I was presented to her Majesty I saw why people hated her. They did not understand her. She was a woman with a large heart, with charity. Some did not suspect this, others forgot it because they beheld a brilliant personage with keen perceptions who would not submit to being bored. Her Majesty made many enemies at court of persons who believed she was making fun of them. There was a dress-maker at the French court called Mademoiselle Bertin, who became ridiculously pretentious because the Queen allowed the woman to dress her hair in private. Bertin used to put on airs with the nobility when they came to order gowns, and she was very rude to me when I went for my court dress. There was a ball at Versailles the day I was presented, and my father told me that her Majesty wished to speak with me.",

If she wished a mirror, she would not wait for it to be passed through half a dozen hands and handed her by a Princess of the Blood. Sometimes she used to summon me to amuse her and walk with me by the water in the beautiful gardens of the Petit Trianon. I used to imitate the people she disliked. I disliked them, too.

AN EPISODE IN THE LIFE OF A MAN Out of the blood and ashes of France a Man had arisen who moved real kings and queens on his chess-board--which was a large part of the world. The Man was Napoleon Buonaparte, at present, for lack of a better name, First Consul of the French Republic. The Man’s eye, sweeping the world for a new plaything, had rested upon one which had excited the fancy of lesser adventurers, of one John Law, for instance. It was a large, unwieldy plaything indeed, and remote. It was nothing less than that vast and mysterious country which lay beyond the monster yellow River of the Wilderness, the country bordered on the south by the Gulf swamps, on the north by no man knew what forests,--as dark as those the Romans found in Gaul,--on the west by a line which other generations might be left to settle. This land was Louisiana. A future king of France, while an émigré, had been to Louisiana.",

Napoleon, by dint of certain screws which he tightened on his Catholic Majesty, King Charles of Spain, in the Treaty of San Ildefonso on the 1st of October, 1800, got his plaything. Louisiana was French again,--whatever French was in those days. The treaty was a profound secret. But secrets leak out, even the profoundest; and this was wafted across the English Channel to the ears of Mr. Rufus King, American Minister at London, who wrote of it to one Thomas Jefferson, President of the United States. Mr. Jefferson was interested, not to say alarmed. Mr. Robert Livingston was about to depart on his mission from the little Republic of America to the great Republic of France. Mr. Livingston was told not to make himself disagreeable, but to protest. If Spain was to give up the plaything, the Youngest Child among the Nations ought to have it. It lay at her doors, it was necessary for her growth. Mr. Livingston arrived in France to find that Louisiana was a mere pawn on the chess-board, the Republic he represented little more. He protested, and the great Talleyrand shrugged his shoulders. What was Monsieur talking about? A treaty. What treaty? A treaty with Spain ceding back Louisiana to France after forty years. Who said there was such a treaty? Did Monsieur take snuff? Would Monsieur call again when the Minister was less busy?",

Mr. Livingston did not cease to indulge in his enjoyable visits to Talleyrand--not he. But in the intervals he sat down to think. What did the inaccessible Man himself have in his mind? The Man had been considering the Anglo-Saxon race, and in particular that portion of it which inhabited the Western Hemisphere. He perceived that they were a quarrelsome people, which possessed the lust for land and conquest like the rest of their blood. He saw with astonishment something that had happened, something that they had done. Unperceived by the world, in five and twenty years they had swept across a thousand miles of mountain and forest wilderness in ever increasing thousands, had beaten the fiercest of savage tribes before them, stolidly unmindful of their dead.",

Spain, with a handful of subjects inherited from the France of Louis the Fifteenth. Could Spain stop them? No. But he, the Man, would stop them. He would raise up in Louisiana as a monument to himself a daughter of France to curb their ambition. America should not be all Anglo-Saxon. Already the Americans had compelled Spain to open the River. How long before they would overrun Louisiana itself, until a Frenchman or a Spaniard could scarce be found in the land? Sadly, in accordance with the treaty which Monsieur Talleyrand had known nothing about, his Catholic Majesty instructed his Intendant at New Orleans to make ready to deliver Louisiana to the French Commission. That was in July, 1802. This was not exactly an order to close the River again--in fact, his Majesty said nothing about closing the River. Mark the reasoning of the Spanish mind. The Intendant closed the River as his plain duty. And Kentucky and Tennessee, wayward, belligerent infants who had outgrown their swaddling clothes, were heard from again. The Nation had learned to listen to them. The Nation was very angry. Mr. Hamilton and the Federalists and many others would have gone to war and seized the Floridas.

The wind was rising. Mr. Livingston was a patriot, able, importunate, but getting on in years and a little hard of hearing. Importunity without an Army and a Navy behind it is not effective--especially when there is no wind. But Mr. Jefferson heard the wind rising, and he sent Mr. Monroe to Mr. Livingston’s aid. Mr. Monroe was young, witty, lively, popular with people he met. He, too, heard the wind rising, and so now did Mr. Livingston. The ships containing the advance guard of the colonists destined for the new Louisiana lay in the roads at Dunkirk, their anchors ready to weigh,--three thousand men, three thousand horses, for the Man did things on a large scale. The anchors were not weighed. His Catholic Majesty sent word from Spain to Mr. Jefferson that he was sorry his Intendant had been so foolish. The River was opened again. The Treaty of Amiens was a poor wind-shield. It blew down, and the chessmen began to totter. One George of England, noted for his frugal table and his quarrelsome disposition, who had previously fought with France, began to call the Man names. The Man called George names, and sat down to think quickly. George could not be said to be on the best of terms with his American relations, but the Anglo-Saxon is unsentimental, phlegmatic, setting money and trade and lands above ideals.",

But George meant to go to war again right away, which was inconvenient and inconsiderate, for Napoleon had not finished his game of chess. The obvious outcome of the situation was that George with his Navy would get Louisiana, or else help his relations to get it. In either case Louisiana would become Anglo-Saxon. This was the wind which Mr. Jefferson had heard. The Man, being a genius who let go gracefully when he had to, decided between two bad bargains. He would sell Louisiana to the Americans as a favor; they would be very, very grateful, and they would go on hating George. Moreover, he would have all the more money with which to fight George. The inaccessible Man suddenly became accessible. Nay, he became gracious, smiling, full of loving-kindness, charitable. Certain dickerings followed by a bargain passed between the American Minister and Monsieur Barbé-Marbois. Then Mr. Livingston and Mr. Monroe dined with the hitherto inaccessible. And the Man, after the manner of Continental Personages, asked questions. Frederick the Great has started this fashion, and many have imitated it. Louisiana became American at last. Whether by destiny or chance, whether by the wisdom of Jefferson or the necessity of Napoleon, who can say? It seems to me, David Ritchie, writing many years after the closing words of the last chapter were penned, that it was ours inevitably.",

And I, David Ritchie, saw the flags of three nations waving over it in the space of two days. And it came to pass in this wise. Rumors of these things which I have told above had filled Kentucky from time to time, and in November of 1803 there came across the mountains the news that the Senate of the United States had ratified the treaty between our ministers and Napoleon. I will not mention here what my life had become, what my fortune, save to say that both had been far beyond my expectations. In worldly goods and honors, in the respect and esteem of my fellow-men, I had been happy indeed. But I had been blessed above other men by one whose power it was to lift me above the mean and sordid things of this world. Many times in the pursuit of my affairs I journeyed over that country which I had known when it belonged to the Indian and the deer and the elk and the wolf and the buffalo. Often did she ride by my side, making light of the hardships which, indeed, were no hardships to her, wondering at the settlements which had sprung up like magic in the wilderness, which were the heralds of the greatness of the Republic,--her country now. So, in the bright and boisterous March weather of the year 1804, we found ourselves riding together along the way made memorable by the footsteps of Clark and his backwoodsmen.",

A subtle change had come upon Kaskaskia with the new blood which was flowing into it: we passed Cahokia, full of memories to the drummer boy whom she loved. There was the church, the garrison, the stream, and the little house where my Colonel and I had lived together. She must see them all, she must hear the story from my lips again; and the telling of it to her gave it a new fire and a new life. At evening, when the March wind had torn the cotton clouds to shreds, we stood on the Mississippi’s bank, gazing at the western shore, at Louisiana. The low, forest-clad hills made a black band against the sky, and above the band hung the sun, a red ball. He was setting, and man might look upon his face without fear. The sight of the waters of that river stirred me to think of many things. What had God in store for the vast land out of which the waters flowed? Had He, indeed, saved it for a People, a People to be drawn from all nations, from all classes? Was the principle of the Republic to prevail and spread and change the complexion of the world? Or were the lusts of greed and power to increase until in the end they had swallowed the leaven? Who could say? What man of those who, soberly, had put his hand to the Paper which declared the opportunities of generations to come, could measure the Force which he had helped to set in motion.",

The wind was stilled, the blue wood smoke curled lazily from the wide stone chimneys of the houses nestling against the hill. The afterglow was fading into night; lights twinkled in the windows. Followed by our servants we climbed the bank, Hélène and I, and walked the quiet streets bordered by palings. The evening was chill. We passed a bright cabaret from which came the sound of many voices; in the blacksmith’s shop another group was gathered, and we saw faces eager in the red light. They were talking of the Cession. We passed that place where Nick had stopped Suzanne in the cart, and laughed at the remembrance. We came to Monsieur Gratiot’s, for he had bidden us to stay with him. And with Madame he gave us a welcome to warm our hearts after our journey. “David,” he said, “I have seen many strange things happen in my life, but the strangest of all is that Clark’s drummer boy should have married a Vicomtesse of the old régime.” And she was ever Madame la Vicomtesse to our good friends in St. Louis, for she was a woman to whom a title came as by nature’s right. “And you are about to behold another strange thing, David,” Monsieur Gratiot continued. “To-day you are on French territory.” “French territory!” I exclaimed. “To-day Upper Louisiana is French,” he answered.",

   "text": "This book has been named “The Crossing” because I have tried to express in it the beginnings of that great movement across the mountains which swept resistless over the Continent until at last it saw the Pacific itself. The Crossing was the first instinctive reaching out of an infant nation which was one day to become a giant. No annals in the world’s history are more wonderful than the story of the conquest of Kentucky and Tennessee by the pioneers. This name, “The Crossing,” is likewise typical in another sense. The political faith of our forefathers, of which the Constitution is the creed, was made to fit a more or less homogeneous body of people who proved that they knew the meaning of the word “Liberty.” By Liberty, our forefathers meant the Duty as well as the Right of man to govern himself. The Constitution amply attests the greatness of its authors, but it was a compromise. It was an attempt to satisfy thirteen colonies, each of which clung tenaciously to its identity. It suited the eighteenth-century conditions of a little English-speaking confederacy along the seaboard, far removed from the world’s strife and jealousy. It scarcely contemplated that the harassed millions of Europe would flock to its fold, and it did not foresee that, in less than a hundred years, its own citizens would sweep across the three thousand miles of forest and plain and mountain to the Western Ocean, absorb French and Spanish Louisiana, Spanish Texas, Mexico, and California, fill this land with broad farmsteads and populous cities, cover it with a network of railroads.",

But The Crossing was in Daniel Boone’s time, in George Rogers Clark’s. Would the Constitution stand the strain? And will it stand the strain now that the once remote haven of the oppressed has become a world-power? It was a difficult task in a novel to gather the elements necessary to picture this movement: the territory was vast, the types bewildering. The lonely mountain cabin; the seigniorial life of the tide-water; the foothills and mountains which the Scotch-Irish have marked for their own to this day; the Wilderness Trail; the wonderland of Kentucky, and the cruel fighting in the border forts there against the most relentless of foes; George Rogers Clark and his momentous campaign which gave to the Republic Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois; the transition period--the coming of the settler after the pioneer; Louisiana, St. Louis, and New Orleans,--to cover this ground, to picture the passions and politics of the time, to bring the counter influence of the French Revolution as near as possible to reality, has been a three years’ task. The autobiography of David Ritchie is as near as I can get to its solution, and I have a great sense of its incompleteness. I had hoped when I planned the series to bring down this novel through the stirring period which ended, by a chance, when a steamboat brought supplies to Jackson’s army in New Orleans--the beginning of the era of steam commerce on our Western waters.",

Elsewhere, as I look back through these pages, I feel as though the soil had only been scraped. What principality in the world has the story to rival that of John Sevier and the State of Franklin? I have tried to tell the truth as I went along. General Jackson was a boy at the Waxhaws and dug his toes in the red mud. He was a man at Jonesboro, and tradition says that he fought with a fence-rail. Sevier was captured as narrated. Monsieur Gratiot, Monsieur Vigo, and Father Gibault lost the money which they gave to Clark and their country. Monsieur Vigo actually travelled in the state which Davy describes when he went down the river with him. Monsieur Gratiot and Colonel Auguste Chouteau and Madame Chouteau are names so well known in St. Louis that it is superfluous to say that such persons existed and were the foremost citizens of the community. Among the many to whom my apologies and thanks are due is Mr. Pierre Chouteau of St. Louis, whose unremitting labors have preserved and perpetuated the history and traditions of the country of his ancestors. I would that I had been better able to picture the character, the courage, the ability, and patriotism of the French who settled Louisiana. The Republic owes them much, and their descendants are to-day among the stanchest preservers of her ideals. WINSTON CHURCHILL. Boston, April 18, 1904",

   "text": "Welcome to the Project Gutenberg edition of The Crossing by Winston Churchill. We have used the original publication of this book, the 1904 MacMillan edition, as the source for our transcription. On a few occasions changes were made to correct obvious errors. Differences between the text and e-book are explained here. A few items that may be errors are listed below, but we did not correct an error unless it was an obvious one. Sometimes, a word had been hyphenated in the book to split across two lines for even spacing, thus forcing the transcriber to make a choice. Some of those decisions are listed below.Page 54: Changed a double quote nested inside of a double quote to use single quotes. “Behold, I ... affliction.” became ‘Behold, I ... affliction.’ Page 82: Journeycakes is spelled without a hyphen here, but the journey-cakes of Page 94 and Page 95 had a hyphen. There were four occurrences of “journey-cake” and “journey-cakes” and no other occurrences of the word spelled without a hyphen. The inconsistency was retained. Page 147: The repeating “at all at all” looks like a typo, but Churchill also used “at all, at all” on Page 222. No changes were made. Page 150: grog-shop was hyphenated between two lines, so could be transcribed as “grog-shop” or “grogshop”. With no other examples in the novel, we went with the latter usage— no hyphen. Page 152: The word “three-score,” split across two lines with a hyphen, could be transcribed as “threescore” or “three-score.” Two lines after that word, a sentence began “Threescore years!” The word was hyphenated for spacing and not transcribed with a hyphen.",

   "text": "Page 310: Add quotation-mark after Mr. Temple: \"Good-by, Mr. Temple,\" she said… Page 317: Hell-fire was split between two lines for spacing purposes. The decision to retain the hyphen in the transcription is traced to a prior use of the word in this novel. On Page 40, hell-fire was spelled with a hyphen, and the word was in the middle of a line. On Page 321 and Page 322, changed double quotes nested inside of double quotes to single quotes. For example, “Ay, ay!” became ‘Ay, ay!’ Page 338: Place period after all the tribes. Page 375: Remove comma after tinkle of a guitar. Page 385: Was Mounsier de Saint-Gré at home? This question should end in a question mark but the author put a period there—and so did we. Page 426: Ignored hyphen in black forest-swamp. In print, the hyphen occurred at the end of a line. However, the novel writes “forest swamp” on Page 51 and “forest swamps” on Page 216--and never uses “forest-swamp.” This inconsistency was assumed to be a publisher's mistake in typesetting. Page 448: “fianancier” may be dialect, but in other quotes of characters it is spelled “financier.” See Page 192, Page 250, and Page 283. No change was made. Page 494: The verse following Caroline is printed to sheet music in the book. Page 588: The preposition “to” is missing from the following phrase: “she drew the ivory from her gown and gave it me.” “Gave it to me” sounds better. Nevertheless, the sentence was written without the to, and it remains as the author wrote it in the e-book.",

   "text": "Some inconsistencies were highlighted above, but there also were instances where New Orléans was given an acute accent, but more often so, it was not. The same occurred with Miró. Another inconsistency was the author italicizing banquette and piastre as part of his rule of italicizing foreign words, but failing to do so all the time. We retained these inconsistencies in transcribing the book. There were some cases where it was difficult to distinguish whether there was or was not a space before 'll. The contraction 'll was not spaced for common contractions, such as I'll, he'll, they'll. However, there was a space for “Breed 'll”, “what 'll”, “M'lisse 'll”, and other uncommon contractions formed with 'll. Sometimes, with line compression to justify the text, it is difficult to tell whether there should, or should not, be a space between the two parts of the uncommon contraction. In those cases where it was difficult to tell, we applied the convention as stated above. Two confusing passages to transcribe are Davy's narration on Page 284 and Page 285 and Hélène's narration on Page 583. Other paragraphs contain quotes embedded within quotes. We changed double quotes nested inside of double quotes to single quotes because our error-checking utilities flag the second double quote as an error.",
